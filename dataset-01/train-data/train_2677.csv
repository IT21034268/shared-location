3,Not a Food Snob,"I like that Mr. Richman is not a food snob. The best barbecue in America makes as great a meal, in his mind, as a dinner with white Italian truffles--or the black French truffles.The book, which is a collection of earlier published essays, is mildly entertaining. I liked the essays at the beginning about his parents--particularly, his mother's cooking--best. It bothered me that some of the essays were written long ago and probably out of date and not relevant.I couldn't help wondering throughout the book if Mr. Richman is obese. I couldn't tell from the book picture and haven't been able to find any other pictures.There are definitely more entertaining eating experience books out there."
1,"For a young audience, at best...","I went into this novel with high hopes but the sad fact is thatany science fiction fan with basic education and critical thinkingskills will find ""Defeated"" to be a painful sojourn into a televisionstyle nonsense plot filled with techno babble and silly charactersthat do nothing to engage the adult reader.This book might be more enjoyable for young readers, that are ableto utterly suspend disbelief and give no thought to plot, but I wouldnot recommend this book to any adult."
2,An uninspired fanfiction in disguise,"I found the story to be pedestrian and uninteresting. The whole time I read it-admittedly I gave up after chapter five-all I could think of was, ""Clearly McKee knows nothing about the military that he didn't learn watching Stargate: SG-1"" He also misuses words and abuses his thesaurus. I was not interested in any of the characters, least of all our protagonist. An insubordinate officer is not an interesting character. I got this book for free with my registration at a convention. I still felt cheated."
4,Good debut novel,"I ordered this book as part of a package deal and ended up liking it a lot.It's got a lot of surprises, some humor, great military action, and it's sci-fi. What more could you ask for?"
1,Didnt like it,I didn't like this book. I just couldn't get into it and did not finish it. Not worth your money.
1,Candle lites by Vector don't work,"Tried and failed twice to receive candle lites that worked. No light. No charge. Junk right out of the box. First time around I called Vector. You can only leave a message for a call back. They called 2 days later. They did not seem to care or want to know, just told me to ship it back to wherever I bought it, not deal with them. Second bad shipment I left them a message again. This time no call back. I am now awaiting a refund from Amazon, as I don't dare order them a 3rd time only to be disappointed. Good idea, bad product."
5,First position,The DVD arrived in the spected time and also when I look for the film it was easy to find and with picture on the two sides of the DVD to allow me to see all details.
2,Sad,"The more dance films I see the more I wonder if I'm the only one who hopes for the promising kids to flunk out now before it's too late, before they've wasted their entire childhoods in pursuit of a chimera and find themselves washed up, a physical and emotional wreck in their early 20's."
4,Children in Ballet,Good Documentary..about children and parents who support them in dance.Documentary is very good and I enjoyed it. worth the money for the dvd . Would recommend it..
1,First Position,Totally love this movie when we saw it in Wellington. Purchased it for christmas but sadly it is a zone that cannot be read in NZ - so we can't watch it. Little disappointed but thats my fault for not understanding how the zones work (or don't work as the case may be). The movie its self is incredible and a must for any young dancer.
5,Inspirational,"Great movie, I saw it in the theater and was so happy to have a copy at home to watch. You don't need to be a ballet lover to be moved by the film. It's just a collection of great stories about kids pursuing their dreams and all the hard work and sacrifice it takes to get there."
5,Great film!,"Even if you are not a ballet buff this film is wonderful. Inspiring and so real. Got this for my niece's birthday, shes a ballerina and she LOVES seeing others because there are not many people like this where she lives."
5,Great Moview,The movie shows the reality of people who are striving to make their dreams come true. Good for teaching children how other people are devoting their time and effort to accomplish something.
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"As a dancer, this film touched a special part of my heart and I have to admit I cried several times. I felt every single emotion every one of these dancers did because we have all been there at some point. It was amazing to see such a beautiful documentary that showed the ups and downs of the dance world and just how cut throat it is. On the other hand I fully believe that even if you're not a dancer or know anything of the dance world this would still be a great film that anyone could enjoy. First Position wasn't shown in any theaters near me so I was elated when I found it on Amazon! I've watched it twice already and I know I'll watch it again soon!"
5,Fantastic! A Must for Ballet Fans,Saw this in the theater and eagerly waited to add to my collection. This is a very accurate portrayal of today's ballet competition.
2,Nice but too contrived,"I recently saw First Position in a theater and came away with mixed feelings. It has its lovely, uplifting moments, and is as good a documentary as can be found on a ballet competition. (This documents the saga of several competitors as they prepare for and compete in the annual Youth America Grand Prix.) Some of the photography is stunning. However, watch with a few grains of salt, as a lot of the 'plot' is contrived. For example, the documentary presents young Aran Bell as just one of the 100s of dancers in a competition when, in fact, the lad won the grand prize the year BEFORE this film was made. Also, we are not told what the ballet world knew months ago, before the film aired: that the film's director has long been a personal acquaintance of the Youth America Grand Prix founders and owners. So there is more than a heaping dose of 'phony' here. It's a shame that the film-makers didn't just let nature take its course."
5,Trill Gangsta Boogie Music From Lord 3-2,"H-Town's own, Tre Deuce, hooks up with legendary producers like Swift, John Bido, Mike Dean and the always awesome N.O. Joe and delivers us with an album full of nathan but fire! The Wicked Buddah Baby is the quintessential rider album. His loc'd up flows and the awesome melodic G-Funk beats get you in the mood to tear the streets up. The album is fun to listen to, not too overly violent or depressing, he can get serious on tracks like ""Them Against Me"", but he can also be a little humorous and at times laid back on other tracks like ""Kickin Flowz."" Standout tracks include the relaxing ""Buddah Nature (remix),"" the bass heavy ""Welcome tp the Slab,"" the sick rider anthem with UGK ""Do You Wanna Ride,"" and ""Comin' Down;"" heck, just about everythang here slams! Rap-A-Lot is a legendary label and albums like this are testament to it!"
1,Flimsy and cheap,I bought this mesh bra saver and it didn't last very long before it broke. The plastic ring which helps the bag hold shape came off first and then the zipper dismantled. Right now I'm using it with binder clips until my next (hopefully more durable) bra ball comes.
1,mesh bra bag,"first saw this product, thought -'what a great idea!'-handwashing molded bras-forget it! have gone through 4 bags-the reinforcing frame of pieces of moldable wire would cut its own hole in its fabric casing and slip completely out,the zippers would break,etc - didn't take long, either. I used parts from one to fix another,put on new casings,even reinforced one with plastic craft canvas,so sure I was on the right track!(plastic craft canvas will eventually crack,just so you know)But always wondered why someone didn't invent a better 'mousetrap', one that also held the shape of the bra cup,cut down on chafing or abrading action on the bra - it still moves a lot in the bag during the wash.The idea is right- the product is just too cheesy.Now have ordered the 'bra ball'to try-maybe this is the better mousetrap!"
1,Poor quality! Broke right away!,"I purchased 4 of these products to wash my bras in. The first one broke the first time I used it. The second one broke after the second time I used it. The third one broke after about the seventh time I used it. I contacted the company after the first broke and didn't hear anything. I then contacted Amazon who notified me that I'd be refunded, then I finally heard from the company. They sent me a replacement (which is still useable after several washes, but the plastic spine to hold it up has come out!). I then notified the company that the second broke and after a while they responded by saying that I needed to mail both of the first 2 items back before they can do anything. I sent them both back about 12 days ago and still have yet to hear from them, receive a replacement or a refund! Find a better product to use!"
2,Not the best bra saver,I bought these to replace Tide bra savers that I bought at Target.Yesterday one of bra savers fell apart in my washing machine.I think it was poorly constructed and am shopping for a replacement. It didn't last long at all...not a good use of my money!
1,"Changed design, product no longer works","I had one of these for almost two years and it was great. It really helped preserve my bras. So when it broke, I ordered two more, neither of them made it through one wash! I am not sure if they changed the design or started using different materials but it is definitely not the same thing I once had. Seeing as two of them fell apart in their first wash, I won't be ordering this product again."
3,different....kinda,"i dont really know how to rate this cd. it's good. but comming from skinlab its kind of weak. skinlab had a wall of sound and a big crunch on the first two albums and its really missing here (except for slave the way). the songs on this album are like a diet-skinlab or skinlab-lite.... plus some cheezy moments like ""anthem for a falling star"" which isnt too bad till you hear the chorus backround voice come in and say ""15 minutes of fame""... i cringed on that song...then the same song has some guy talking like he works for the circus........its weird...i dont know whats goin on in the skinlab camp...but it needs some fine tuning for the next record..."
1,numetal,"that is what this band has become. this cd flat out [isn't good]. only slave the way has any nuts to it and the rest is bland, boring, dull. completely forgettable [stuff]. their second album was awesome. buy that. don't waste your money or time with this. give it some mall-core kid, he'll probably like it."
1,Chewy Sausage,I bought these sausages along with some Merguez sausage (Algerian Lamb Sausage). The merguez was wonderful and I am going to order them again soon. However the saucisse de Toulouse were close to inedible. They were chewy and had hard lumps in them.
1,Kindle Version is a Fail for Me,"I purchased the trilogy in one book even though I've already read Black because it was cheaper than buying the next two separately. Once on my Kindle, I can only navigate page by page or by putting in a specific location number. Imagine my frustration as I have to try to find where the 2nd book starts. There is no table of contents and I cannot use the 5-way to jump from one chapter to the next as with other books I've seen. The ""pages"" aren't labeled, so I don't know where I am in the book (like which trilogy or chapter I'm in at the time) when I select a random location number. I now have go through page by page...This is my very first book purchase on my very first Kindle.I am incredibly disappointed and unimpressed."
2,I felt like the story was spinning in Circles,"As much as I liked the concept, I could not get into thiese stories. They felt repetitive and I got tired of being reminded that he is passing between 2 worlds and when he is asleep in one, he wakes in another."
5,Three Great Books in One,"If you want the whole trilogy in one convenient package, then this is for you, it's easier to store and gives it a flowing feel, from one book to the next."
2,Beware Kindle version of this book,"I bought this Trilogy for my Kindle 2, but because it uses the new ""Topaz"" format -- which allows publishers to embed their own fonts, apart from the default font the Kindle uses -- the typesetting for this book ended up being horrible. Even enlarged it caused me constant eyestrain until I finally gave up and stopped reading. I'll have to find this used in print someday, if I ever want to read it. Users should have a choice over what font the book uses, rather than letting publisher's decide what looks good to them."
5,Red Like Blood,"This is a great book. I liked black a lot. Then, Red was even better. White was just as good as Black. Unlike Black, White has an unexpected ending. The climax is thought provoking.There are many reasons why I like this story. I think the best one is that the main character keeps going back and forth between two realities. It's like reading two stories. Both interesting. It's very appealing the way the author connects these two worlds.RED is pretty much a war story. Then again, that's the one world. I suppose what's going on in the other reality could be classified as a disaster story. Afterall, the world is on the brink of ending through biological terror. I found the ending of Red to be very emotional. Ted Dekker appears to be a master at presenting ""tears of joy."" He's got a knack for showing, not telling. His method makes the reader feel the scene.I'm eager to get started with his novel ""Infidel."" Talk to you about it later."
5,I have no words.,The only thing I can really say about Dekker's Circle Trilogy is that it was divinely inspired and beautifully executed!
5,"Unbelievable, Amazing, absolutely Incredible, and all those other adjectives.","I'm an avid reader who's been completely spoiled by great modern writers such as Tom Clancy, Michael Crichton, John Grisham, and Frank Peretti. Ted DekKer has completely blown me away. These books DEFINE the supernatural thriller. They excel in every way, start to finish; They grip your mind, your imagination, and your heart, rip them to pieces, and put them back together in an explosion of perfection. Fast and brutal, beautiful and challenging, these masterfully written novels will leave you satisfied yet longing for more. Never break the Circle.~Sam"
4,Where does he come up with his ideas?!?!?,"The first time I read through this series, my initial thought was this is the strangest, most bizarre thing I had ever read. After reading it the second time, I began to see similarities between this fiction and reality, although I had never pictured the angels Gabriel and Michael as white bats! But as a good fiction story, I enjoyed it. It keeps you wanting to read to find out what in the world he's going to think up next!"
4,Do his books not translate well to Kindle?,I just finished reading Black on my iPad kindle app. I know that all books aren't transposed badly. Is this something to expect? I loved the book and it's theme of not eating the fruit given by the beautiful bat and the juxtaposition of Elyon but sometimes I got taken out of the story by the badly transposed words. Was this done on purpose? Were the mis-spelled and run on words done with intent? Interesting....... Snce I bought the trilogy plus Green on iPad Kindle I'll let you know.
5,"Thank goodness the kindle version had all three, so I could finish the story.","This was a fantasy with a wonderful message where the message comes together by the end with a powerful finish. I loved the fantasy of skipping times from the present to the future, where the future could almost be the past. As much as I dislike violence, this book needed it to contrast it with the message. I couldn't put this down. Read it and find out for yourself. Kudos to the author."
5,Goood,"THis watch is perfect for an OU fan. specially when the games come around. Perfect size for a guy, nice and light."
2,Freezes and skips,I bought it for the hi-end playback of CD's. It is excellent compared to my former Sony player.The bad news is it has been in the shop twice and still sticks on even brand new CD's. I has gotten better on DVD's.I've complained to Denon and get nothing but BS.I'll never buy another Denon product as long as I live.Avoid.
3,Decent Samba,"For those who enjoy samba music, this is a nice CD. The sound is perhaps late 50s. There is NO Bossa Nova on this one."
2,Dated at best..,"While the root concepts explored in this book are somewhat relevant, the tone is bland and the info is quite out of date. The copyright is 2002 but the text was obviously written between 1991-92. There in no mention of the MLAT treaty which Switzerland has signed since this was published. Keep looking."
5,IRRESISTABLE,"A delectable collection of Caribbean pop, this album is like a vacation for your ears. The ultra-sunny selections, and the non-stop, infectious island rhythms transport you to some island getaway, conjuring images in your head of beaches, coconut drinks and dancing til dawn. Though all of the music here is wonderful, my favorites are the more pop-infused songs: Sunny Day and of course the mega-remake of that pop classic Dancing in The Moonlight."
1,A Waste of my Money,"This book is not at all what it is billed to be. It is simply a (very long) listing of all colleges in the U.S. that offer degrees in music, and their addresses, phone number and website addresses. There is no other information offered. What does a parent or student do with all this information? Not much!"
1,Dont go to college for music,Please reconsider if you are going to college for music. Keep music as a hobby or at most a minor.
4,great for backpacking,"I have taken this backpacking and it worked well, yes it is small but msr is known for making products geared less for car camping and more for backpackers. so if you can spare a few ounces this is worth the comforts."
2,Do not dishwash,"Do not put this product through the dishwasher at the end of a trip! Although there is a dishwasher safe logo on the plastic case, my lid warped slighly. Other than that a handy kitchen kit."
2,This is a very small kitchen set,"I purchased this item for a family camping trip, however, it is so small, that it really is only good for a one person camping trip. Not worth 32.00. So think again, before purchasing it."
5,Patho,This book was exactly what I ordered. I got it within a week and it was like new. Thanks again.
4,"Good recording, but...","This is fairly heady stuff...here are actual recordings of some of the most famous, influential stage actors from the 19th and 20th centuries taking another bow. The only disappointment is that although the disc comes with a table of contents, it does not state which actor is reading any particular passage. So unless you are old enough to have actually heard Edwin Booth in person, you will have no idea which voice belongs to him."
5,A masterpiece,"More relevant than ever. This masterpiece of a musical play deserves to seen again and again.The back story is important too. Nixon tried to censor the movie and almost got Cool Conservative Men destroyed. Fortunately, a brave person saved and hid it. It's on the DVD and it is an eerie and wonderful moment beautifully choreographed by Onna White.Sherman Edwards and Peter Stone, both rip, have created a wonderful example of a musical that fits no formula.Molasses to Run is one of the most extraordinary songs ever written. A defence of slavery with blame spead all around, the song expresses the tragic flaw that has eaten away at the United States since its founding."
5,1776 needs DVD...,"Wow! This is a great musical only, as pointed out below, it needs to be restored to it rich brilliance and brought to us unadulterated on DVD. What better movie for the 4th of July (or any time of year for that matter) then this historical gem. DVD please!"
2,Not as good as I remembered,"I first watched this movie in high school. The movie does a great job of introducing the signers of the declaration of independence.I rented the movie thinking my 11-year old son would enjoy the history. He enjoys history and is especially interested in American Presidents. What I had forgotten was the language in the movie. I suppose foul and vulgar language gave the movie a humor of sorts, but I regretted renting it at the half-hour mark. I'm going to pass on its purchase."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this DVD some time ago, but decided that it would be appropriate to watch on Constitution Day. I was stunned at the ongoing cursing and taking the Lord's name in vain, especially for a movie 37 years old. I took it out and put it in the trash."
3,Would Students Benefit from this Movie?,"I am posing a question regarding the musical 1776.From an educational standpoint, would students benefit from watching this movie? I know it is rated PG, so I would have to get permission from parents so that students can view. Please give me your opinions, please."
2,No where near as good as Pioneer's Laserdisc version!,"Since Pioneer's laserdisc version clocked in at 181 minutes, and this DVD is around 166, you had to know that this release was going to be inferior. And, no surprise, it is. The Entrance, Intermission, and Exit music have all been cut out. The last verse to ""The Lees Of Old Virginia"" is gone. Plus, one of my favorite scenes has been taken out...When John Adams is waking up at the foot of Thomas Jefferson's stairs, and Philadelphia is starting it's day.What a tremendous disappointment this DVD is, after having seen the Pioneer's laserdisc release. Shame on Sony, and Peter Hunt for not giving us the entire print of this fabulous movie!"
4,1776 Movie,"The movie was worth the wait. It is quite accurate and depicts a moment in our history that is the foundation of our country. The acting is believable and takes you to the spot were this all happened.Worth the money , it should be in your library"
5,Biting commentary,"My children and I have been watching this over and over again. This movie is more than just a musical-about-history-and-patriotism. It has a very clear and at times uncomfortable message about concern for human rights and justice vs. greed and (yes) ""property as a bad word"". As Hancock hints to Dickinson, the ""right-winger"", those who support the British empire were in fact motivated more by support of the ""half-crown"" than of the Crown. ""Cool, cool considerate men"" could be sung by the Republicans in Congress today. Adams is the true hero here, and a role-model to those of us who care less about being ""obnoxious and disliked"" than about overcoming tyranny, including by our own government. I recommend this as much for the political message as for the song and dance."
5,Love,My daughter and her friends have watched this so many times. The history is accurate enough and the songs and performances are wonderful.
3,1776,It is a very enjoyable work however I was a bit disappointed that the director's cut had left out some of the original movie that I feel helped to make this much stronger. I would recommend that the original be placed in position for sale so the individual does not miss out on some of the nuances that take place around George Washington having actually been appointed General in charge of the army.
2,They should call it 1775,"A mixed bag for this terrific property. While, on the one hand, Columbia/Sony discovered the original negative and replaced the workprint sections that had detracted from this film's original restoration, and invited director Peter H. Hunt to supervise the re-mix and add new commentary with the late writer Peter Stone, Hunt regrettably deleted the overture, intermission, recessional, and some underscoring music. It's to the studio's credit that they handed this vastly entertaining and authoritative film back to its director, but not that he himself cheapened the viewing experience. It was, and still is, a klunky movie; the concept, book, and performances are strong but the music and lyrics, let's face it, are silly, like having paper money jump out of your wallet and start singing. Nevertheless, ""1776"" is a remarkable teaching tool and fun to watch -- the kind of film where the hero writes with a feather and calls it Macaroni."
1,Part of a movie,"I bought this because I'd seen the stage version on its original tour and also the movie on its original release.If I had realized John Cullum's rendition of ""Molasses to Rum to Slaves"" was missing, I would not have paid a penny for this DVD. I don't know how you can call a movie restored when one of the most striking scenes is missing. I call it theft."
3,Sparked my interest in history when I was a kid,"I have always enjoyed 1776 as a lighthearted depiction of the events leading up to the signing of the Declaration of Independence. A great musical? Not really. There's not much in the way of memorable tunes and none of the principle actors could sing (Ken Howard in a musical?). But still I find this movie entertaining. And it is a fun way to get kids interested in history. Also, could we please retire the tired old phrase ""the emperor has no clothes"" in reviews (Nov 7, 2006). It's as if the reviewer is saying, ""Being smarter than the common herd, I saw this film for what it was, a piece of junk. I didn't like it and the rest of you are stupid for liking it!""If you don't like a film, fine. Just make your case in your review and recognize that people have different tastes."
2,Rainy Day...,"Goofy, yes. Campy, yes. Not the best-produced thing you'll ever watch... but what fun to sit and pass an afternoon with friends watching. Maybe even singing along?"
5,Informing with style,This movie is an excellent teaching tool for an American history or government course. It entertains while giving an in-depth glimpse of the collective and individual psyches of the men (and women) who risked everything for an unknown future.
5,Video review,"GOOD, GOOD GOOD!!! I LOVE this musical. The casting was superb, the songs actually fit the movie, and, miracle of micracles, when I read biographies of John Adams, Ben Franklin, and Thomas Jeffferson, I realized he had used the ACTUAL words they had written in their letters!! Almost every word in the movie was truthful and accurate. It's my favorite musical, and almost my favorite movie!! SO good! Everyone should see it, if just for the casting.I've seen it at LEAST 20 times, and every time is like new."
4,totally recomended!,wow! one of the best musicals i've seen! it puts comedy with history and you really learn facts! entertaining and great songs with the weaving of history to make it historical but yet fun!
5,One of the better Musicals around,"This just another example of how good Americans are at making musicals. It is light, warm hearted and a fairly accurate film. While I won't claim its perfect as it does drag on at places. Its still a good movie to see on the 4th."
3,Kind of Disappointed,"I love this movie and know all the songs and dialog but for some reason, don't ask me why, I assumed the ""Director's Cut"" would be in letterbox. You would think that the director would like to have his movie in that format. It isn't and for me it negates all the extras since I can't even see all the people in the scenes."
5,Excellent all the way,"An excellent film and the dvd was delivered without problems. Very well done with just the right mix of humor and history, making the declaration story very entertaining. Those characters you always read about that seem so dry in the history books really come to life in this film."
5,1776 The Musical,I had a VHS copy of 1776 which was reorded when it was shown on TV. The copy was not good. My wife and I had enjoyed 1776 and wanted a good copy to keep. Amazon had just what we wanted. A Restored version of 1776 on DVD. We bought it and have really enjoyed it.1776 (Restored Director's Cut)
4,Still An Enriching Experience,"They may have cut the overture and intermission, etc., but what was restored in the directors cut lengthens the original. And I don't really feel the previously edited songs enhance the experience. Just like my dislike of ""Apocalypse Now Redux."" A poor addition of far inferior scenes in my opinion. Fortunately, ""1776"" still remains a patriotic and historical delight. Almost like watching a stage production, another example of how film adaptations done right, can add to the limitations of stage scenery. Should be required viewing for school children of all ages."
4,We're waiting for the chirp.,"1776 is a brilliant movie about the fathers of America. We watched it in my 8th grade history class and I loved it. It has great songs like Sit Down, John, But Mr. Adams, The Egg, and my favorite The Lee's of Old Virginia. Richard Henry Lee is very entertaining in this movie. Another good song is Molasses, to Rum which is very chilling. This is A great movie to watch which makes history even more entertaining."
4,1776 a DVD must have!,"Having just finished watching the DVD release of 1776, I feel like I've not only revisited and old and favorite friend, but learned all new things about him! The restored footage is fantastic - buy it for no other reason than to hear Cool, Cool, Considerate Men. An outstanding musical number, which of course makes Dickinson's motivations much clearer than in the cut up version released in theaters. There is much more dialogue debating independence, which is most welcome. Also, some rather saucy dialogue concerning the establishment of prostitutes in New Brunswick near the Continental Army camp. 1776 is one of my favorite musicals, and was always a MUST see every July 4, until it was no longer shown in my area. I had to content myself to singing along with the CD of the original Broadway version. I would rank the film version at least in my top five favorite movie musicals, along with Singin' in the Rain, Meet Me in St. Louis and Kiss Me, Kate. You won't be disappointed!!"
3,Great Movie but when's the widescreen coming,"I love 1776 but the this cheap video version drives me crazy. I'm still waiting for a VHS or DVD widescreen version. How about one with THX remastering. It would be nice if they could figure out a way to restore the ""Cool, Cool Condsiderate Men"" number as they did for the special laserdisc version a few years back."
3,The play was better,"It's better then nothing. Even if you don't know what's missing in the minutes they hacked off, you sense the flow is missing in spots. If you ever have the chance to see the play, do it! You won't be sorry."
4,Wow! What a show!,"I really loved this play when I saw it on stage. It really portrays our Founding Fathers in a realistic light. John Adams is an obnoxious man who misses his wife, Jefferson didn't want to write the Declaration of Independance, and Franklin is an old man with the gout. I found the song Molasses to Rum a great song- it shows the other way of thinking about slavery that we don't hear about much. The Lees of Old Virginia is just plain fun.Although this film is choppy, and they cut out a great song, it is still fun to watch. I highly recommend it to anyone."
4,A Must for History Buffs,"The musical productions are at times forced. However, the content of the struggles for Independence is what makes this a compelling piece of work. Even if they took liberties (no pun intended) on actual conversations, showing issues of the 1700's as being the similar to 1900's...some of those issues still play out today. Maybe not so much as north/south issues but as democrat/republican issues.Buy it, and force High School Sophomores to watch it."
5,A perennial patriotic favorite,"I loved this back in 1975 when I first saw it. I have made it an annual July 4th habit to watch it since 1981. I love the feel of this movie, the dialog and the climactic signing of the Declaration of Independence. There are plenty of good songs to make of for the slight historical bends. Overall, this is a fun and moving movie."
5,Spectacular,"This is a great movie, it's funny, it's got great songs and besides being a wonderful movie in general-- it's educational. What better way to learn than by watching a funny movie? My little sister who's 8 doesn't get it, But I'm 12 and I do-- But it really depends on what you like to watch."
3,suffers from pan & scan,"The previous review (June 10) was very helpful. I especially endorse his point about the need for the movie to be in widescreen, which apparently doesn't yet exist. 1776 is a prime example of how much of the picture we're missing with pan & scan format.When I first saw it in the early 70s, it seemed too solemn and flag-waving for its day - and it still should be viewed with a critical eye for what it does and doesn't admit - but it's held up surprisingly well and does a very graceful job with a subject not readily lending itself to a musical."
5,One for the ages!,"Truly a masterpiece! The finest performance that I have ever seen transfers to the screen. This is a production where you will enjoy it as much the first time as the 1776 time, with the only difference being your uncontrolable desire to sing along."
5,Wow,This a movie that in an instant grabs your atention and gives you the opportunity to get into the spirit of the American Revelution. The film depicts the personalties and trials of the men that helped to form our you ng country. A must see!
4,ALMOST AS GOOD AS BEING THERE,"I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED THE PLAY AND THE MOVIE....This is a GREAT show especially for anyone who has an interest in the early stages of American History. I also enjoyed the ""added bits"" to the dvd. It was almost as good as seeing the original play once again."
4,humorously interesting,"Considering that it was made in 1972, probably on a limited budget, it is a very interesting and educational look at what the founding fathers went to in order to achieve our independence. If you can overlook the at times corny bits, (I never thought I'd see Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Benjamin Franklin dancing down a staircase together) It was well worth the money, and a good watch for anyone interested in American History."
4,"Did Ben Franklin have gout, or did it just rhyme well?","I bought this DVD to celebrate my neighbors' receiving their green cards and starting their way onto citizenship. We saw it together and it was fun. Not all of the songs or performances will stick with you after viewing, and a 10-year-old in the room occassionally got bored between songs, but it was still entertaining and educational."
5,Wonderful musical for all ages from any era!,"I watched this film many times in my childhood. It has always left quite an unforgettable impression on me. I very much suggest anyone reading this review to either rent or purchase a copy! You won't regret it! If anyone knows where I may find the 180 minute Laserdisc version of this film, please send me a message!"

2,Don't be fooled,"Do not buy this product. The description implies that the clipper attachment is metal and is somehow ""professional"" in quality, but in fact, it is mostly made of cheap plastic with a cheap aluminum clip. The teeth are sharp and not rounded and the overall quality is lower than the standard plastic attachments. I would send it back if the shipping didn't cost more than the product."
4,"Decent albums, way overpriced.","This album was released in a positive and negative version. The positive is a dark, depressing ambient piece, while the negative is a noise album with some melody to it. Both are good, and a refreshing change from V/Vm's normal work. But $30 is too much for just one version. Go to the labels (V/Vm Test) website, where you can get both versions for $10 each."
5,a book with a wonderful zen-like message for all ages!,"i originally read this book to my child when she was about 4. this message so struck me that i bought a few copies for friends and asked their opinion. without exception, all were taken aback by the simple message in a childrens' book and it's clear and simple message for adults as well. i now keep copies on hand and always bring it as a house present to leave on a bedside table. or just instead of a card atop a gift. it is a beautifully written book that everyone loves with a universal message of empowerment."
5,Memorable,"I had this book when I was younger- I'm 20 now. I was thinking about a story I read when I was younger about a couple who moved a mountian (or at least thought they did). I also remembered the Reading Rainbow rendition. I searched all over the Internet for the title because I no longer have it, or can't find it. Then I remembered it was a Scholastics! book. Here it is 10+ years later and I still want to read it."
5,Funny!,"We checked this book out of the library and our 5 yr old daughter just loved it! I like it because it's clever, quality literature for little ones that makes all ages laugh. The illustrations are also fantastic and add wonderful depth to the humor."
1,"Poorly written, bland and predictable","Bought this to read on a flight out of Vegas. Regardless of whether the characters in it are true or not, I found the plot to be boring most of the time, predictable all of the time, and gripping none of the time. His writing style is simply awful, and detracts heavily from what little story is there."
2,Bonus Materials not included,"Tha book I ordered was in the shape it was listed to be, however, it was not included in the original description that the Cd-Rom was not included with the book and I have had to get a copy of this from classmates in order to complete several of my assignments."
3,Did the job!,The book was in pretty good condition but it arrived without the CD that I needed for 3 assignments so I was not a Happy Camper!
5,Lasting value,"My college uses this for their introduction to education course. The book touches on the history of education in America, learning styles, multiple intelligences, g/t, special education, students' cultures, ESOL, laws pertaining to educators, reform movements, and so much more. 3 years later this book is always in my living room, car, or backpack. I have referred to it for EVERY education class as well as some content area classes. Well written with a story to open each chapter which is referred to throughout the chapter, tying together concepts. Useful inclusion of graphic organizers, one of the most comprehensive websites I've seen for a textbook. I would highly recommend this book for any college or university looking for a text for their first course in their education sequence, and as a supplement for any education student that did not feel their assigned text was useful."
2,Mediocre at best,"I am no educational research expert, but the Sadkers seem to have a very left-wing political slant in their presentation of ""the facts"". Their so called ""You be the judge"" and other controversial issue discussions often give both sides without any evidence behind the various points of view, leading the reader to believe that they are equally valid.The book isn't particularly useful either when it comes to seeking real world advice on lesson planning, disciplinary procedures, or how a mere teacher can make his/her voice heard on the school district board to effect change. It's highly theory-based and speaks in very general terms. This is characteristic however, of many published pieces in the genre. Facts, figures, and charts are prominent and welcomed, but are few and far between.Overpriced for little content."
3,no cd,I purched the book expecting it to have a cd with it. To my suprise no cd and the one I was offered was from an eariler edition. Cd was shipped to someone else and I have a book with no cd. Hopefully I wont need it. Other then that the book is great. thanks
1,This book is BIASED.,"This is a Introduction to Education College textbook. Chapter 5 Reforming America's Schools (Schools as tools for Change) ""To re-constructionists, society is broken, it needs to be fixed, and the school is the perfect tool for making the needed repair. To prepare students for such engagement, social democratic re-constructionists, believe that civic learning, educating students for democracy, needs to be on par with other subjects."" A social action curriculum."
3,Alright.,"I needed this book for a class, and I honestly did not get much use out of it, but that is probably due to the fact that it was not heavily relied on for my class."
2,i can print this on my own printer,"cheap quality, it was like a stolen image from the net and printed at kinko's. i should of done that myself."
2,Let Down,"A disapiontment.Promoted as a ""bizarre"" tale, full of ""intrigue"" and yadda yadda yadda, this is instead a rather dull story of a group of men trudging around, lost, in the jungle. Many of the ""details"" in the book are pure conjecture by the author.For once in my life I would have to advise renting the video rather than reading the book."
2,Bad Screenplay!,"Where are the writers? Hunky boyfriend and a daddy whose - well, I won't give it away. But my god, have we forgotten how to write a movie. The look of this film was impressive. The cinematography is gorgeous, but the script was Missing In Action. Why? With such impressive visuals the dialogue is just silly and the bastardization of the original fairy tale is unfortunate. Well, maybe this film can serve as a cautionary tale of what not to do with a script and how not to retell a fairytale.2 Stars for the CinematographyMinus Three stars for the script"
2,Slow and painful.,Red Riding Hood starring Amanda Seyfried just left me bored and confused. It's hard to believe that this film is produced by Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Catherine Hardwicke. I found no redeeming quality about this movie. Seyfried is a beautiful girl but this is definitely her worst peformance by far! She is so wooden as the title character and Gary Oldman just overdoes it. I can see why this film got a lot of bad reviews...it's a total stinker!
2,Didn't like it.,"This movie, was all bilt up to be this big, exciting, Scary movie. But, It Didn't work. Im sick of seing Amanda Seyfried, in every popular movie. This movie, is set in th 1800's and it just Doesn't work. I Found it stupid, and it could have been much better. The tried to give it a bit of a surprising twist, at the end, but that didnt work either. I wish, they would Re-Make it, and Make it better. Very Dissapointed with this film."
4,hood,strange creepe movies does not have a plot or meaning to it no wonder it was cheap that ok i add to my collection
2,Didn't like,"Even though I like Amanda Seyfried, I didn't care for the movie. It had some good twists, but didn't keep my interest."
3,Visually Stunning,"Very much enjoyed the movie for it's visual quality. Also a fan of Amanda Seyfried, but I found the story line to be weak."
2,Can you say twilght anyone?,"This movie just seemed to much like twilight except its not set in modern day. The one guy even king of looks like Edward. It was like twilight with a cheaper budget. Totally disappointed by this movie, the trailer made it look better than out actually was. I wasn't so much waiting to see who was the werewolf, but waiting for the credits. Skip this one."
3,Entertaining. Sort of.,"I'm a (male) fan of Twilight and had enjoyed Catherine Hardwick's work in that film and figured this might be a more...interesting...take on the fairy tale. And it's not bad. The casting is reasonable, although Billy Burke and Gary Oldman aren't given much to do and the supporting cast is a bit weak - but the love triangle in the center of the film works well enough. The biggest problem is that the movie's plot feels like it needed a significantly bigger budget or more time in the editing room to make it more cohesive and flow better. I wouldn't recommend it for the story alone, but if you tend to like very stylized movies, there are worse ways to spend a week day evening."
3,Just a so so movie,This was ok. Not really what I expected? If I had seen it before I would not have paid for it.
2,Wasn't impressed,"Was an ok movie to watch the first time, but not something I really need to add to my collection."
4,This was Pretty good.,"It tried to stay true to the old fairytale involving the key elements of the story while giving it a new and ""unique"" drama/lovestory makeover. It was pretty cool but I was disappointed with the way certain things were written, the whole I cant be with you because bla bla bla is really old and overused and they dont REALLY have a reason and the main character ""the huntsman"" Has a REALLY messed up hairdoo.. hes the only person in the movie with hair-gel and hes got a literal shitton of it on and it looks GOOFY AS HELL... Other than that.. yea.. it was pretty good, watch it because wolves are cool."
1,Zero stars,"An absolutely awful movie. Waste of time, unbelievable storyline, horrible actors, and strictly for clueless teens.Surprised that it is rated as 3 stars by Amazon reviewers. Very shocked to see seasoned actors like Julie Christie and Gary Oldman in this mess. Guess they needed the $$$."
3,Lil Red Riding Bore,Pretty Predictable. Build up to the ending waspretty slow. Amanda Seyfried makes the perfect Red. The acting wad lame for the other actors.
3,ONLY REASON TO WATCH THIS WOULD BE IF YOU LIKE LOOKING AT AMANDA SEYFRIED...,The story is good but the dialog is just terrible. I could swear I saw a pair of tennis shoes on the little girl at the begining of the movie. Most of the acting was B movie at best. The special effects weren't much better. But if you like fairy tales you might enjoy this movie if the above issues don't bother you when watching a movie.
1,The ending is what makes it so bad,"If it weren't for the ending, this would just be another two star movie. It has the standard bad acting and lack of plot.Small town is being terrorized by a shapsehifter that they mistakenly call a werewolf. I would have been content to leave it there were t not for the ending.###SPOILER###In the end the wolf is the dad just like you suspect from the first minute f the movie. What gets me is that when he offers to take the girl away with him as the wolf, she is like you are the devil. It royally irked me that she shunned such a sacred gift offer, but to add insult to injury, when the boyfriend is bit, she is all excited to run away as a wolf with him!"
4,Dark and suspenseful,Very good movie. Amanda Seyfried was excellent in this movie. Just the right amount of suspense and the scenery was gothic and haunting.
3,It was great,The CD got here quick...The movie was kinda strange...but all in all it was great that the product got here fast.
5,Very interesting movie,I expected to not like this movie but I actually really liked it. Kept my attention the whole time and I even bought one for a friend.
3,Not bad,Not a bad movie. It left something to be desired though with the storyline. It seemed just a tad cheesy.
4,RED RIDING HOOD,RED RIDING HOOD. MUY INTERESANTE TRAMA CON UN BUEN DIALOGO Y UN SUSPENSO BUENO ES LO QUE MANTUVO MI ATENCION DURANTE TODA LA PELICULA Y PROBABLENTE LA VOLVERE A VER EN UNOS 12 MESES
4,Hey Twilight,"If you like ""Twilight"", then you will love this movie also. At first I thought it would be like ""Curse of the Golden Flower"", but nah, it was good, just enough color, good story."
3,About what the trailer portrays,"Given the attention paid to vampires and vampires vs werewolves in the chic-flic genre lately with features such as Twilight and True Blood, it was only a matter of time before someone came out with a werewolf movie. This movie was heavily advertised in movie trailers and on the web in the months leading up to its release. This was good, as the movie itself would not have generated the fan feedback to drive large ticket sales. The movie delivers what the trailer portrays. There is the girl caught between two guys. There is the werewolf hunter, and a grandmother with some talent, along with various other village women whose morals span from good to bad. The movie has romance, a little comedy, and some suspense. The special effects are good, along with the cinematography. The DVD itself is plain, nothing special to brag about. Overall, an OK movie."
4,"Surprised myself, liked this movie!!","I was not expecting this to be as enjoyable as it was...very pleasantly surprised! I love a good fantasy or horror story, but I do not like a lot of blood and gory stuff . This movie had some blood, but not bad and the movie was entertaining and suspenseful. a good retelling of the old faerie tale"
1,YUCK!,I feel sorry for Gary Oldman. He had to try to act with these talentless hacks. I've rarely seen so much bad acting in one movie. Even Gary had trouble showing his true talent with this poorly written script.
4,I love the darker versions of Grimms' Fairy Tales,"I like the soundtrack in this film, especially Wolf. I am a fan of Amanda Seyfreid and Billy Burke. I like Catherine hardwicke as a director. I especially liked the ""I didn't see that one coming"" climactic ending of the film."
2,Looks pretty no substance,"You've seen this movie before. It looks pretty but the story is kind of dumb unless you're into religious idolatry and talking wolves. If you like this twilight teenage stuff you'll probably like this movie, if you have at least moderate movie taste probably not. It's not like hollywood will actually dig up a new story to slap on the screen so it has to be based on something like a fairy tale, old movie, history, etc, because people don't want to watch something new and fresh unless it involves creepy looking garbage eating aliens."
4,Great Movie for a Sleepover!,"First of all, I loved the scenery!! Snowy background contrasted with Red Riding Hood's red and black coat.... Eerie night full of suspense... Handsome man and beautiful girl...A movie doesn't have to be fantastic to be entertaining. This movie starts out strong and ends strong. At the end, you are wondering where the time went... Girls, grab your hot chocolate and your blankets (don't forget those smartphones!) and settle in for a night of good, clean fun!And you don't have to think much....but you have to pay attention! Have fun and enjoy the show!!!"
1,Amazon send me the wrong one,"I bought this item on black friday, but i received the wrong one. Mine have not a slipcase and 2 discs. It's a simple disc in a amaray. I was not happy but I can't return it because I open the package. I pay only 3,99 so it's not a biog deal. I must bought another one. This time the right one."
3,An acceptable telling,"This ""Red Riding Hood"" reminds us that, back when these stories originated, they captured real and adult fears. We have our own fears today, including the witch-hunt that adds tension to much of the movie - a complex set of tensions that touches each person differently. Themes of secrecy and betrayal, parental ambition, and divided affection also contribute their part to this mix.So, when all these very workable parts add together, is the total so much less than the sum of the parts? I'm not sure. The divided loyalties lack urgency, the surprise near the end comes seemingly from nowhere, with no dramatic buildup, and the demise of the witch-hunter seems a bit too pat. The movie flows well and uses imagery with good effect. Despite its Twilight overtones, the script just never gave much to care about. I enjoyed this well enough, as commodity entertainment, but won't be hunting it down again.-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters"
1,Unoriginal Junk,"Wanted to like this movie, I really did. The only good thing I can say about it is I didn't pay to see it. Gotta love gift cards. Red Riding Hood with werewolves, easy way out in my opinion. Probably would have gotten over that if the acting wasn't so damn bad, Gary Oldman is the exception but that man is good in just about everything. This fact is even more annoying since there are a lot of good actors in the movie. The people who are supposed to love each have no chemistry and the movie didn't even creep me out. I'm all for reinventing fairy tales but this one is ridiculous. The only other good thing about this, other than Gary Oldman were the sets. Everybody's tastes are different so I won't tell you not to buy it but I will tell you if you haven't seen the movie rent it first and form your own opinion. In mine it's a waste of your hard earned money."
1,Hideous,"As others have said, this had the very basic framework of what could've been a good, atmospheric film, but ruins it with a ridiculous script, bad-looking sceney, and atrocious acting. Amanda Segfried essentially did nothing but look perpetually surprised. Oldman must've really neded the paycheck... why does an actor of his calibre make so many turkeys? Mystifying. The remainder of the cast was just there... stiff, one-dimensional, depthless. Anyone could've played anyone. You'll likely keep watching to see if it gets any better and to find out who the wolf is, but still be disappointed. Truly a waste of time."
1,Not my cup of tea,This just wasn't to my liking. I couldn't pay attention to it for very long. Didn't bother pausing the movie when I got up to leave the room. Never really seemed like I missed much when I returned.
5,Red Riding Hood,"I actally love the movie, I waited a long time for this one to come out, I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, however what I will say it dors stay close to the red riding hood image however it is different... If you love horror you will love this one and this actress is great."
3,Red Riding Hood...,"Here's the math:An old-fashioned romance + Werewolves = Red Riding Hood (2011)?Doesn't seem add up in my book.If I didn't know better, I'd swear this was a re-tooled ""The Howling (remember that movie?)""Ultimately predicable. No mystery here.Don't get me wrong, I really like the cast - an excellent group. Their efforts would have been betterspent in another endeavor.What's next? Goldilocks? (I hope not...)Another time-honored fairy tail corrupted by Hollywood.Frankly, I prefer the Warner Brother animated cartoon starring Bugs Bunny...but that's just me...I rate Red Riding Hood...3 stars."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever paid money to see,"There are no words to describe how bad this is. Sure it is visually beautiful, but for no discernible reason. Just pieces of a puzzle that don't fit. Why are the haystacks shaped like cones? Why is there a giant iron elephant? The movie is incoherent and poorly acted. I mean, come on - I was a teenage girl not that long ago (the target audience, clearly) and I did not then, and do not now, appreciate being shamelessly pandered to.This is NOT a gothic romance, and it is NOT even a good teenage movie. Go see Jane Eyre or pretty much any John Hughes movie if that is what you are looking for."
2,Couldn't live up to the hype!,"Not even the acting GENIUS that is Gary Oldman could carry an entire film...he's tried this several times with bad scripts and ends up being the only light in a very dark tunnel.This movie could only be described by me as DULL. The visuals were great...I loved the settings, even the music was suitable to the film...but everything else, the acting, characters, script, storyline...etc....well, it was DULL. I was extremely disappointed.Other than the visual aspect, I can also say (on a positive note) that the movie was obviously geared toward a younger crowd and other than a few make out scenes with some physical contact, the movie seemed suitable as far as gore and fear factor. I would think perhaps 15-16 and up as far as age suitability.This movie was so played up, I'm not sure that any but the finest film could have lived up to that sort of hype."
3,"Grandmother, what big teeth you have.","Set in a medieval village there is the same old story of a young girl betrothed to the son of a rich man but secretly in love with another. There is a little layering of the story as there may have been another secret romance. Yet we have no time for those things as the wolf seems to be expanding his diet and a professional is called in for the dispatching of the misunderstood furry creature.Seems that our hooded heroine can communicate with the wolf which does not bode well of her future.Will she go quietly or be eaten herself. Could be we are in for a big surprise.The movie was not brilliant but watchable. There was a wolf, a riding hood, and big teeth. There are a few scuffed and missing body parts as part of the story; however no excessive gore. It is good to see that Julie Christie (age 70 at time of filming) is keeping a hand in acting as the big eyed grandmother."
2,"If I wanted ""Twilight""..","I would have watched Twilight. Not only is this not a ""Twilight"" version of Red Riding Hood, it's really.. just a bunch of ideas thrust together in an attempt to make a Twilight version of Red Riding Hood.There were probably a dozen ways to make this movie better, and the writer didn't bother. It's one of those movies where the story absolutely sucks, and no matter how many great actors you have in it, they can't save what they're in.Don't bother buying. If you must, rent it through netflix or redbox."
2,Yeah...just mediocre at best,"This movie had great potential, but for whatever reason, it just never really caught me up in the story. I think the plot was just too contrived and the characters underdeveloped. It just goes to show you what happens when your story isn't right on target. Not a bad movie, but I won't probably watch it again."
1,horrible,the set must have cost somewhere between 1 and 2 thousand... or maybe they just used the stage from my old high school theater
1,Cheap Twilight Wannabe,"Just another disappointing Twilight wannabe! This movie was a disappointment, don't waste your time. The director should look for work elsewhere!"
1,One of the worst movies ever,"I normally don't waste my time writing reviews on bad films - but this one was so exceptionally poor if I can spare someone the grief, it will be worth it.The visual design is rather fun and fairytale like, and Gary Oldman makes an appearance with some decent acting. Other than that, there are no other redeeming qualities to this film.The script is pathetic.Who funds these films?A very sad commentary on imagination and the lack of artistry and intelligence in film."
3,"Way, way too much.","Honestly, the camera work and the acting is very good for such a gothic setting, but the screenplay is far too much like twilight; the re-writing of vampire and werewolf lore to set it in a more romantic and almost sexual setting. It's not bad as a rental, but it is certainly forgettable. I won't waste your time any further... the movie will do it just fine."
3,An excelant story,"It is apparent that Hollywood had discovered Grimes fairytale. Now they are changing them up and giving new life to story by presenting them in a different fashion. Why Grandma, what big teeth you have. It is a good mystery and wonderful love story."
4,Buy it if it's cheap,"I just wanted to help boost the ratings of the movie by voting favorably for it. I liked it. If you can get it on sale, get it."
4,An Appealing Artistic Fantasy Romance,"As an Artistic Fantasy Romance this movie was very watchable.The visual elements were superb (a red riding hood frequently shown on a snowy terrain backdrop - wow:)The actors were very good and the plotline was entertaining - containing elements of adventure, friendship, romance, and mystery (revealed at the end as always:)I thought it was neat the way they spun a unique story out of something I thought I knew!"
4,I really liked this movie!,"I really liked this movie. I bought it with really no expectations, but now after I've seen it I'm glad I bought it."
4,good twist on the fairy tale,"Decent movie with good actors to boot. The storyline is close to the original fairy tale, but with some twists and a more grown-up version. Not a good movie for young kids, as it has alot of violence, but teenagers and adults I think will like it. Keeps you guessing at who did what, so that gets your interest. I originally bought this for my teenage daughter, but I liked it too."
4,Good movie,"Good movie, entertaining. The look of the movie is impressive. Not a deep drama but what do you expect in a fantasy movie."
3,scratched,just bought this movie and was scratched.love this movie however i just wished it was in better condition!over-all worth buying this movie!
5,great movie,"got it on time great movie, the rental i got when i bought was awesome, because igot to watch it right away"
5,A-,"The dialogue isn't the best, but the relationship between Valerie and Peter is fantastic. The chemistry was perfect and the story line was great."
4,Good movie and HD is great,This movie is a low budget horror/thriller twist on the Red Riding Hood story. Don't expect oscar worthy acting but it's a good movie and the HD transfer is great!
4,I was pleasantly surprised with this story line!,"From the adds on TV, I had no desire to see this. It appeared to be a blood fest film, or something like that. When I was ordering varrious movies for Christmas presents, I saw this was on special, so I bought it. I have always been a wolf-man fan. This turned out to be a very different approach and reasonable well done. There are two endings, both fine. I enjoyed the first one I saw first more...but that is personal taste. I won't say which it was.."
1,Twilight all over again....... great.........,"I was hoping for a unique film based on this classical, yet weird story of Red Riding Hood. Instead I saw nothing but ""No Talent"" ""Twilight Saga Film Approach"" Trash! Save your money and time of your life, and exclude this from your Blu-ray collection! Even your DVD collection for that matter! Luckly before I even bought this film, I saw it on DVD for ""free"" at my friend's house. And thats pretty much what this film is worth... Free Trash."
5,Classy Fairytale,"I loved the cinematography and style of the movie. I'm a long way past tween or teen, and I really enjoyed the movie and wondering what kind of new twists would be added to the story."
2,Pulled the hood over my eyes,"A glance at the ratings show that people are all over the board with this one. I found it to be dull and rather amateur. Most of the dialogue is so poor that the acting comes across contrived. None of the lead actors inspired any emotion into their characters until, perhaps, the final scenes of the movie, which contains the only real drama engaging the audience. Some will no doubt like Red Riding Hood, but it pales in comparison to Blood & Chocolate or Van Helsing."
2,didnt like it!!!,"fell asleep three times watching it... predictable story... bad acting. cant recommend it. like they tried too hard to make it ""adult"", and i hated the female lead."
2,The Big Bad Wolf....isn't!,"This was a terrible movie. The acting was atrocious, the plot was idiotic and the werewolf special effects made Twilight look good (if that's possible)! Save yourself an hour and a half of the life you have left and skip this cliche ridden, so-called werewolf movie. I could have used the $100 they paid the writer to ""create"" this farce!"
3,Stylized fairy tale,The trailer seemed intriguing and I like Amanda Siegfried so I watched Red Riding Hood. I was a bit apprehensive because of the bad reviews but it wasn't that bad. The plot wasn't really extraordinary but the style the movie was shot was to me a project based on a vision because it was so stylized. Sometimes it's too much that it takes away from the progression of the film.
2,Kind of a rip off,"So the movie wasn't total crap, but not at all original. I kept comparing it to the 1985 movie The Company of WolvesThe Company of Wolveswhich I really did like, despite it's age. Nice idea for a movie, but could have been better."
3,Visually beautiful. Weak plot.,"I am a fan of the director; I prefer her somewhat gritty style. I felt sufficiently misdirected by the possible wolf candidates, so that was good. What really annoyed me was the voiceover. This was weak exposition and resolution. A little dialogue would have been a sufficient replacement. A little spring thaw would have sufficed to show the passage of time. I was disappointed by the structuring of the story."
2,Another franctured fairy tale,"There's no good reason for watching this movie after terrible reviews when it was originally released. Still, Amanda Seyfried is always easy on the eyes. Then there's Gary Oldman, Virginia Madsen and Julie Christie. Can it really be that bad? Well, yes it can. For every actor in the caliber of those mentioned above there's Max Irons and Shiloh Fernandez as emotionless and stone faced potential suitors for Valerie (Seyfried). Hell, they make Edward from ""Twilight"" seem exciting. Speaking of ""Twilight"", director Catherine Hardwicke from this film also directed the first and perhaps only watchable ""Twilight"". I guess she was trying to capture some of the ""magic"" in this clunker. The sets are crummy, the script is painful, the fairy tale clichés are horrible, the acting is bad, the special effects aren't special, and the sex is non-existent. I mean, what's the point?"
1,How could it be this bad,"This movie was so bad, I felt like turning it off and watching Battlefield Earth, which makes Battlefield look like an acedemy winner. Horrible acting, the story is lame, Oldman as great as he is cannot bring thie piece of poo up. It makes no sense. Its a want to be werewolf movie that fails in all aspects.. Acting, Story, Effects, well, everything. DO NOT BUY.. DO NOT WATCH... IF YOU DO YOU WILL DIE IN 3 SECONDS...."
1,DULL NONSENSE,"this movie is ridiculous and is a copy-cat of the Twilight movies. like that wasn't enough. the story stinks, the actors are all terrible. very bad movie, very bad script, just all bad."
1,Worst Film I've Ever Seen,"This film was garbage. Bad acting. Bad directing. Bad script. Just a borefest. Insults the viewers intelligence. Didn't realize they dirty danced in those ancient times and had great hair gel. Amanda Seyfried basically plays what she's been playing in all those romantic films. She can't seem to choose between two pretty boys. Oh what's a girl to do. Wait wasn't this supposed to be a horror film? 45 mins. in still no horror. Just young beautiful actors moping around brooding in front of the camera for no reason. I've never felt the need to give a film this low a rating before, but this one isn't even worth that."
1,One of the worst movies I have seen.,"Being a fan of Amanda Seyfried, I purchased this movie with some expectation that it would be a good movie. Was I ever wrong. The movie is garbage. The plot has been done before. The characters are one dimensional and not believable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
2,same director as twilight....figures both attempts were lame,"When I saw this movie I did not know it was from the same director who did Twilight. Actually, I was not fond of the Twilight movie and I am not pleased with this attempt either. The movie is very slow and nothing exciting really happens. There are no any edge of your seat moments or any sort of cliffhanger moments. The movie tries to be a mystery of sorts with the villagers trying to figure out who the werewolf could possibly be. However, the misdirection at other characters is rather weak and once the wolf speaks you can pretty much guess who it is. The romance/love triangle is awkward and predictable...A girl betrothed to one boy; yet, in love with another who can offer her no real future. If you want to see this movie I would suggest renting because it is pretty lame, boring and predictable."
2,Barely squeaks by with 2 stars,"Red Riding Hood really doesn't deserve 2 stars. It is really that outrageously bad. I suppose I gave it 2 stars because it has certain ""production values"" that are somewhat interesting and, yes, it has Gary Oldman, who I am a big fan of, in spite of the fact that he plays a completely ridiculous character in this turkey. My big question is--along with probably most people who have sat through this-is what in the hell is with that big, freaking metal elephant? Who came up with such an absurd idea in the first place? And the whole werewolf bit? It's just all so incredibly STUPID and worse, badly scripted. This flick almost makes the whole Twilight movie thing seem good and that's just scary. The director would have done well to sit down and study Snow White and the Huntsman to see how to take an old story and breath new life into it. But then again, I think this particular story for this particular purpose was DOA to begin with. Again, 2 stars is being very generous."
1,"Red,Red ,Red. So sad.",Did'nt like the acting . Disappointed with story line. Was not my type of horror. Did not watch whole movie.
2,Blurry,When I purchased this DVD I was certain it wasn't 3D but the picture quality was so blurry it makes me wonder. I know when I saw advertisments for the movie to come to the theater the colors were so bright and it looked like a great movie. Maybe it is digital and doesn't play well on an older DVD player. I don't know but I wasn't really happy about the viewing quality.
3,Maybe Rent Before Buying,"I wanted to like this movie, but it was a let down. The acting was boring for me. Gary Oldman could not save this picture and he's a fine actor. I rented this movie and had I kown it was a little like watching the Twilight movies, I wouldn't have watched it. The scenery was eerie, which was nice. I need more than that for me to enjoy the storyline though. Glad I rented instead of buying it."
3,Red Riding Hood (Alternate Cut),"Wow. I saw this movie in the theater and thought it was boring and a whatever movie. So, I rented the Alternate cut Blu-ray thinking they'd add some new scenes that will help the movie out, but I was wrong. There's nothing different, they only add a sex scene and change the ending a little bit and if you blink you'll miss the quick new ending. I love Amanda Seyfried, but this movie is a disappointment.2.5/5"
2,Clumsy Romantic Tale,"The murder mystery part of this movie was alright. I definitely found myself looking for clues and suspecting multiple different characters throughout the course of the movie. The romantic portions of the film, however, were not well-executed. The dialogue and plot developments between the heroine and her love interests was very forced and did not feel natural or intimate at all. It was clear that the director was that of the Twilight saga movies. I would suggest skipping this film and watching Sleepy Hollow instead, which it was unable to emulate."
2,Rental Worthy Only,Watching this movie felt too much like Twilight in a way but despite that the story was not given any time to develop. It was a very loose story through out the film that comes together slightly towards the end. The beginning of the movie is the hardest to watch - it just doesnt feel like the actors were into their roles and there is not development to what era they are in. It was like here is a story about some people in the woods who are tormented by a wolf every so often and then oh wait lets throw a two boys chasing the one girl twist. Just bland. Better to watch it on rental than at the movies.
2,My Red Riding Review,"I was really hyped up by the Red Riding Hood trailers. Then I saw the reviews. Then I saw the movie. My opinions on the film went all the way from high to low to somewhere in the middle.You need to know that this movie is from the folks who did Twilight. There is a commiserate component of teen angst that you should know about. If you can't stand a bit of that, stay away.I am a fan of Amanda Seyfried and her wide eyed expressions so that is a plus for me. There are some attractive gentlemen for the ladies as well. The plot and characters are serviceable but unremarkable. Add in some nice visuals and it garners a 2/5 - watchable if you are bored."
3,A little too unreal,"I actually liked the movie. It was well made and the story was good as well. It had several problems though, like dancing didn't fit the period for one. While I can easily imagine that a werewolf is possible I can't imagine people surviving in winter wearing summer clothes. Nor sleeping naked on the snow with most of their body exposed and actually waking up in the morning. They would be dead of exposure by then. The devil is in the details."
1,Did ScyFy Make this film,"Of course not! if they had, the production values and acting would have been much better. where to start? bad lighting? bad effects? bad acting? it's all there but so horribly morose you can't even enjoy it as a bad movie"
1,Disappointing at best.,"They really had the opportunity to do something creative with this tale. Instead they catered to the Twilight crowd...and not very well at that. The acting, aside from Gary Oldman's contribution, was seriously difficult to endure. The background music sounded cheaply edited and just cheap in general. The wolves could have been amazing but instead were only semi-interesting, staying pretty much shrouded in darkness throughout, which hinted to me that shortcuts were being taken in their overall construction. I had high hopes for this movie but it turned out to be a sloggy endurance test with no reward."
1,What the H***???!!!!!,"I love stories about wolves, vampires, and other monsters, but I was very disappointed with this movie. I believe it has a great concept, however, it was lost in translation. The visual scenery was very beautiful, but the storyline was way lacking. It jumped around too much for my taste, and the choice of music used at the celebration didn't fit the dark ages or 15th century. I am glad I didn't purchase this movie because I would have been very upset that I wasted my hard-earn money, however, if you want to have your own personal ""Razzie"" award show, then this is the movie for you."
1,Nonsensical and i pikced th ebaddy in 5min,"Does deserve 2 starts for graphics but this 1 will offset the bs high ratings elsewhere.Boring delivery, and main girl is goofy not hot at all.Graphics are somewhat good but annoying trend in movies to make things fat so you can't see them is boring.Monster Movie I wana see damn monster!"
1,Can I please have my money back?,"I'm still at a lost as to what the creators intended by creating this movie. From the very first scene, this movie struggled to establish what genre it wanted to be and I felt that I could never take the actors seriously. The potential was definitely there. Visually, this movie was beautiful. However, between the bad writing and over the top acting, this movie was confusing and should definitely be skipped."
1,Major Lemon,"I wish I could give this a good review. It has the bones of a good film, but is destroyed by really bad acting and archetypal characters. Also the metaphor of the story of Little Red Riding Hood is totally lost. I wouldn't say the ending is predictable, just boring. Could have been much better. I mean no on really cares who the wolf is by the end, just that the movie end soon to put you out of your misery. one star is all this deserves."
3,dvd,"the service was great, got the dvd quickly but keep having problems with the disk playing correctly. I have tried numerous methods to resolve the problems but as yet haven't been able to. Don't believe it's a fault on the sellers part, just a problem with the disk. In one section there is no sound and right after that it skips ahead and leaves out a scene."
5,Amazing!,"I love, love, loved this movie!!!! It is amazing, fun, and tragically beautiful. All the actors were perfectly casted. You have to watch this movie."
1,Thornhill has it right,"If it was possible to give negative stars, I would. Thornhill's review of this ""movie"" is much more entertaining than the movie itself. Colossal waste of time. And Gary Oldman must be writhing in embarrassment that he was a part of this project. No plot, no dialog, no sense."
1,Oh no!!!! Please no!!!!,All I can say is Catherine what in the world are you doing????1. Get out of the hellicopter. It was cool the first time but that's enough already.2. Did you really think we want Billy Burke again so soon?3. Amanda can't act worth beans.4. Thank you for not casting Shiloh in Twilight!You wouldn't have made a dime.
4,From a Junior League member,"This was a delightful, easy read that I just couldn't put down! If my Junior League book club handn't selected it, or I never would have had the pleasure. My League in Iowa is not exclusive or pretentious like the one in the book, but we all know people like that (and many of them are outside of League) so it was forbidden fun to peek inside the artificial world of the very privileged. The main character's evolution was fun to observe, but felt a bit rushed at the end. I recommend it to League members for a fun frolick, and I'd like to assure non-League members that it's a view exaggerated (in a fun way) view of the Junior League stereotype."
3,OK Summer Read,Just finished the book...found the plot a little contrived. Things seem to work out perfectly everytime our heroine faces a crisis. Great book if you're on a plane or the beach and have to read it in short spurts. Will probably be a big hit if it gets to the movies.
4,Great find!,"I found this book from reading reviews on Amazon and was very pleased with my find! I thoroughly enjoyed the cute phrases and humorous description of high society in Texas. The plot was engaging from the start as I was drawn into Frede's problems. I liked the character of Nina the housekeeper, and Sawyer the artist, and appreciated the evolution of Frede as she loosened up a bit and became more openminded. Since I enjoyed this book so much, I read The Ex-Debutante afterwards and enjoyed it just as much, possibly more. I hope there are more books from this author of the same calibre - humorous, entertaining and lots of fun!"
4,My husband wanted to know the ending as well!,"As I read this book, I kept laughing or groaning out loud in front of my husband. So of course he wanted to know why. Funny thing is, he didn't like Frede Ware that much. I did, but that's because I can see her as a woman. While my husband didn't like her, he DID want to see how the book ended. By the time I was 3/4 of the way through the book, I was reading whole passages aloud to him. :D It was a great read. My sister-in-law likes it so much that she is making this a part of her permanent library (which she doesn't do verra often)."
5,Very Enjoyable,"I loved this book! Although it did have some mild sexual content I let me 15 year old daughter read it because it has such great lessons about life. Besides, it's very funny"
4,A pleasantly quick read,"It's a bit of a guilty pleasure watching a spoiled princess being taken down a peg or two, but I also found myself seriously wanting Frede to pull herself back up, which she does in a somewhat unexpected ending. Despite the backdrop of tradition, this is truly a story about a woman questioning those traditions and what they mean to her and consequently discovering herself."
1,Not helpful in therapy situations,"The overall idea of this book is a good one, however it was executed poorly. The pictures are clearly meant for young children in theme, but are not in color and do not keep interest long. The story is entirely too long for young children to sit still for. In contract, the font used is not block letters and makes it difficult for children to read what is written. In addition, many of the words are entirely too big for the age range of this target audience. ""The way I feel"" series of books is much better written and illustrated if this is the sort of thing you are needing for your child!"
4,Double check streetnames and directions,"These cards give you great ideas for exploring different neighborhoods and places to stop along the way. But you need to be careful that the directions are correct. I went through about 20 cards (combined walks each day). And each day there was a card with a slight, but important, error in it: the path on the map was drawn incorrectly, street names were incorrect, or the written direction said to go down a street when really you needed to go up the hill. They're useful and I recommend them, but just make sure you have another map with you in case you get a bit lost. But getting lost can be half the fun of exploring a new city."
4,short walks in Paris,Too numerous to do them all but the walks we took were very interesting. Having to flip the card to read where we were was a little annoying. More restaurant stops would also have been helpful.
5,Funny Man Very Serious,"I went to highschool with the author. He was one of the most out of control, funny people in a small school. Amazing he wrote such a moving novel. Its worth your time."
5,Delightful sleeper of a book,"Hopefully this book will be reprinted. It's an offbeat, provocative romp of a book. The characters are unusual, the setting is memorable, and Phillips is a good writer."
2,Not Entirely Satisfied With Version of Songs on this CD,"I researched for quite awhile for the Roy Orbison CD that had most of the songs that I wanted. There are many to choose from, but I didn't want to have to purchase 10 to get every song I wanted. That's the reason I selected this CD. However, some of my dissatisfaction of this CD is with me, as I did not check to see that the song versions were the original versions. None of them are the original version that I was hoping for. The quality is good, just not the ""versions"" that I am familiar with."
1,NOT the very best,"I was severely dissapointed when I put this CD in my CD player. Expecting to hear origional recordings, I was very upset. Everything is re-recorded except for probably, his best hits of the eighties:""You Got It"" and ""I Drove All Night."" I dont recommend it at all."
4,A great compilation for the casual orbison fan!,"This CD belongs in every music lovers collection. Roy Orbison is arguably one of the greatest voices in pop music or otherwise. An excellent selection of his greatest work, I enjoyed almost every track. It receives 4 stars out of 5 because of the sound quality, which I thought could probably be improved. Otherwise a great album!"
4,I wanted to dislike this CD - I really did - but...,"When I purchased this CD, I was expecting the original recordings. When I saw that they were virtually all re-recordings, I felt ripped off. I have heard ""greatest hits"" albums from other artists which were re-recordings. They were very disappointing; they did not sound ""right"" to me. So, I was expecting to be similarly diappointed with this CD. Then I listened. I was very pleasantly surprised. Orbison's voice was strong in every track. No matter if a recording was live, with different backup bands, or sung as a duet, every song sounded very ""right"". This CD contains my favorite Orbison song, ""You Got It"", as well as a couple of interesting cuts such as a 1955-1987 medley of ""Ooby Dooby"".I will be spinning this CD quite a lot. I was pleasantly surprised. If you are a Roy Orbison fan, I think you will be too."
1,Not original versions,"I was very disappointed that some if not all songs were not original recordings or at least remastered. And as another poster noted, there is nothing that states this in the description. The only way you could possibly tell is by sampling the songs."
2,Bought This CD Mainly For One Song,"I wanted a remastered version of ""Crying"" with k.d. Lang. This CD is remastered, but very badly. The instrumentation has been brought out so much that it literally drowns out the incredible vocals of Roy Orbison and k.d. Lang. It should have been remastered the other way around. The vocals should have been brought out further than the music. Very disappointing."
2,not the real thing,"I bought this cd, thinking these were all original recordings which they are not, and mainly because it is so darn hard to find ""you got it"" anywhere,well, I'm disappointed in the digitaly remastered rerecorded songs, they are quite different and disappointing than the originals, there is a wavy warped sound to them, the ""you got it"" song is probably the only good one on this and is as close to original as I remember,but, this song came out significantly later after his untimely death.If you can find the original recordings on another album, with or without ""you got it""I suggest you pass on this cd and get the real stuff."
3,This is really not what it apears to be,Most of this CD are later versions of old songs there not bad and some are very good but if you want his old hits the way they were on the Radio don't buy this disc there almost all redone versions of his hits
4,A nice compilation of Roy Orbison's most popular songs,"Although I'm not a Roy Orbison fanatic, I really like this CD because it has some really good songs. The classics -- Only the Lonely; You Got It; and Oh, Pretty Woman -- are present, but there are some real bonuses. Crying, a duet with K.D. Lang, is outstanding and both performers worked well together. We probably played Sweet Dreams five hundred times to lullaby our semi-colicky infant to sleep. (Actually the entire CD is so mellow and the music innocuous enough that this is a fine alternative to ""Raffi"" :)The only song I wish were on this collection that isn't is ""Working for the Man."""
4,A great collection of many of the best of Roy Orbison!,"I wanted a CD with as many of my favorite Roy Orbison songs as possible. This CD did not disappoint me! It's a great collection, especially of the later versions of his songs. The ""Crying"" duet with K. D. Lang is awesome. Their voices were made for each other. My only regrets are that the full 1987 version of ""Ooby Dooby"" was not included and that this CD overlaps Black & White Night by 50%. The Ooby Dooby medley on this CD is interesting and really shows the differences in styles and audio technology. But I much prefer the Black & White Night version (the show aired on PBS). If that version and ""Candy Man"" had been on this disk, I would have given this CD five stars. Nevertheless, if something happened to my copy of this CD, I'd replace it without hesitation."
2,Lucky ducks won't stop quacking,"This game is simple and easy for a preschooler to play but it keeps quacking the entire game. And if you stack another game on top of it it can also start quacking in the box. I played this a few times with my preschooler but decided to get rid of it because it is so annoying. Plus, my younger child takes the ducks and carries them around the house. Hard to play when you are missing a duck. If you are looking for a game that works on colors and shapes I'd go for Cranium Hullabaloo instead. It makes noise to for some reason is MUCH less annoying. And has an off button."
4,"Daughter likes it, but AAAGH","My daughter (2.5 yo) likes to play with the ducks by herself. she prefers this to actually playing the game, although she does know how to play (with a little help from me on the taking turns bit...). I always know when she wakes up from her nap when I start hearing this game quacking away over the baby monitor.We have several toys that make noise and I can pretty easily tune them out, but I have to say that this one is incredibly annoying. At least it's easy enough to turn on and off!"
3,"Fine for kids, annoying for parents","I realize that if you're reading the reviews you're probably just wondering if the game is educational and/or entertaining. But here's a couple of things you should think about before purchasing. Like other reviewers have said, it would be nice if there were a power switch somewhere on the game. As it is, the big red button that you hit to turn the quacking & movement on/off is VERY sensitive - I can't put the box back up on the shelf without the game turning on. And forget trying to stack another game on top of this one! Again, the quacking starts up! And children can't put the game away themselves because you have to get 3 ducks in each corner with the main piece in the center just right in the too-small box! Because the game itself isn't anything spectacular, parents should definitely consider this type of thing before buying the game."
2,"Could be a good game, with some improvements.","Simple enough game, kids like it.Now, here are my complaints:1) Ducks are strategically packed in the box, so you'll never get the whole game back in the box for storage without some frustration.2) The only power button is a large button sticking out of the top of the game. Although easy for kids to turn on (but by the time they are old enough to know how to play the game they don't need an easy to use power button), if you put anything on top of the box that's very heavy, it'll turn the game on."
1,Good game - terrible noise!,The game itself is easily accomplished and fun for 2-4 year olds. They can play with other children without supervision or assistance.The reason I gave this game one star is 100% due to the incessant repetitive noise. There is no volume button and no off button. The only option is to remove the batteries. Any movement of the box turns the game on and good luck turning it back off. There were times that I would walk past the closet and the game would be in there quacking away....for HOURS!This is the type of game that makes a parent want to drink after listening to it quack for great periods of time! I think ours was still quacking when the garbage man picked up our trash
2,"No Quacking, but Duck Traffic Jams","For whatever reason (broken, I guess) ours never quacked. From reading the other reviews, I guess my version was actually enhanced :) The motor is still really loud, though.I bought this because my 3yo son loves Pick Up Ducks at the carnivals. This game should be called ""Knock Over Ducks"". The first duck that gets knocked over, usually jams up the game, causing the other ducks to pile up and fall over behind it. It quickly turns into a free-for-all grabfest, with any notion of turns dropped.Definitely not my favorite game- Noisy- Ducks fall over and ruin the gameplay- Box is disposable, so you'll need to store the ducks somewhere...or lose them in the tub, sandbox, yard etc.Not the worst game (that goes to the Pizza tipping game we got), but definitely nowhere near the best."
4,Entertains Siblings...,"There are not many toys out there that can occupy a 3 yr old and a 5year old at the same time, and this one does it. This is up there with Hungry Hippos and Elephun for favorite games in our house. I've never had a problem with the game going off in the box, and compared to other toys on the shelf I dont find it at all annoyinig. They also like to play with the ducks without the game. I gave 4 stars because I think it gets boring for the 5 year old when played the way it is intended. Other than that definite recommend."
4,My daughter loves!,"I got this for my daughter when she was 3 and she loves it. She's had it for a year now and still plays with it. The quacking is loud and it would be nice to have the volume a little lower, but that doesn't bother me. Now if you put it away and put something on top of the box, it will most likely set the thing off and that's when the quacking gets to me!There's not that much educational value to it, in my opinion. It does teach primary colors, but other than that the ducks just go round and round. But she loves it and I don't mind playing it with her.My suggestions are like the others, softer volume and on/off switch!"
5,DIFFERENT BUT EXCELLENT ALBUM,"I personally think that the first two albums are the best, Uprising might be my third favorite with To Shoot... and Wolverine Blues trailing behind. An album showcasing the band's love for its influences;Seeing Red - sounds like MotorheadSay It in Slugs - UnsaneYear In Year Out - has a Cali hardcore meets death n' rollThe Itch - has that Black Sabbath with newer stoner rock of DownPlus there is more than a few Slayer/Divine Intervention type riffs thrown here and there for good measure. I think that anyone who can appreciate some hardcore with a little death n' roll Entombed will be very pleased with this album."
5,Even Beginning Knitters Can Do It,"This is an absolutely marvelous book, and not only for intermediate to advanced knitters as advertised. I learned to knit last Christmas and have already completed the sweater pictured in the upper left corner of the cover and, while it was a bit of a challenge, it came out beautifully. The individual sections in this book cover different techniques for applying beadwork to knitting - each with very clear, easy to read, detailed instructions. Also, those of you who already sew or embroider will find some patterns with basic knitting techniques with the beadwork sewn or embroidered onto the finished project. The projects range from simple to very challenging, from scarves to hats to sweaters, from minimal beading to complex bead designs. What fun!"
3,NOT EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED,"I thought I would get more instruction to let me pick up my knitting needles and move foreward with a knitting with beads project. With five years of knitting at an intermediate level, I thought I could at least tackle a project and figure my way through the instructions. After scanning the book, my confidence to try something is zero.I feel I should point out, I taught myself to knit right and left handed. I knitted socks within 2 months of teaching myself to knit and have been able to knit some fairly compicated, multi cabled sweaters. With the ability to knit socks, sweater,hats, mittens and other things, I hate feeling stumped."
2,Not to my taste,"While some of the techniques were interesting and worth learning, the actual patterns themself were, generally speaking, not to my taste."
2,A little disappointing,"I was looking for more on the instruction side of knitting with beads, not just patterns that utilize beads. The pictures weren't illuminated enough to see the garment or object. I guess I wouldn't recommend this one."
5,"Pain Relief, At Last","I was recently involved in a car accident that left me shaken and in pain. My neck, back, and shoulders felt like I had been hit with a brick. But worse than this was the anxiety and tension I was carrying since the crash. Things did not start turning around for me until I started listening to this tape, and letting go of the excess muscle tension that I had been holding in my body. Ms. Dorfman's voice is soothing, and the excercise she leads you through is relaxing. The information she provides about recovering from trauma is helpful, and helped me realize that what I was going through was normal."
1,Poorly Presented,While I will admint I am no math wiz. This has got to be wone of the most poorly presented treatments of a difficult subject I have encountered. Too bad many schools will force you to use it...In fact I would say it is a downright shame!
5,Can holder,Does what it is designed to do. Good space saver under a cabinet. Would recommend for those who desire organization.
3,just OK,The space for cans is a little to wide. You have to be very careful when loading the cans or they will turn side was and fall through causing the dispenser to not work.
3,A fair product with minor annoyances,"This rack is solidly built, but suffers from two design flaws. One is that cans easily turn sideways when being loaded and block the path. The second is that the wires for the top shelf are positioned so that the cut ends can scrape your hand when putting a can in.Still, it's a good product for the price."
1,Not recommended,"The item is too big to fit inside a normal refrigerator. It takes soo much space that it is better to place individual cans the old fashion way. It does not fit in a shelf and it is necessary to place it sideways which completely wastes the entire space. Unless you are planning to use it outside your refrigerator, don't but it."
1,Has a mind of its own,"I'm glad most people are happy with their card because I'm having a terrible time with mine. I just came back from a short trip and was transferring 21 pictures that I took to my computer. By the 4th picture, things came to a halt, it might have been my computer. When I tried again, the camera gave me the ""No image"" message. Yes, the card was blank, all 21 pictures in the camera simply vanished before my eyes while I was transferring them to my computer. This is not the first time. It did do a few little funny things here and there before. Obviously I missed the crucial sign of a greater potential trouble back then. This memory card has compeletely made me paranoid about taking pictures with a digital camera. It's one of those things that money refund won't replace what's been lost."
1,simple Tech 128 MB Comact Flash Card,this card is NOT 100% compatible with mp3 players. and once you get it home and find that out you can't return it.
2,Obviously rushed to market,"I normally expect more from Peachpit. For a book that purports to be ""official Apple training"", this book is so full of typos, inaccurate instructions and mislabled illustrations, Apple never should have allowed their name to be associated with it. I mean, come on! Did anyone bother to proofread this book? Did a single person ever sit down and try to do the exercises as printed? I was occasionally able to figure out what information was missing, or what the authors meant to say, but sometimes I simply had to give up. When an exercise tells you to open a file with a certain name in a certain path, and neither that path nor the file exist, what is one to do? I was very disappointed, as I have been waiting for this book and there are really no other choices out there for quality book training. I hope this is not indicitive of Peachpit's future attention to quality control."
4,Should have been proofed!!!!,"Although the book takes you step by step through the basics of DVD Studio Pro 2, after the first few lesson typos and missing steps start popping up all over the place. These seemingly minor issues add up to an overall frustrating learning experience. The visuals, such as ""Your menu should like this"", often include elements added at a later point. Or, for example, it tells you to choose a 2nd audio track when you have yet to input the 2nd audio track. Every few pages you think you've missed a step which can be very agonizing trying to figure what you've done wrong.If you follow this book exactly to the point, you'll begin to get quite frustrated. However, once you realize it's the book and not you, you'll have a basic grasp of the power of DVD Studio Pro 2. It's just rather annoying reading a book written by people who have seemingly not proofed the course themselves."
2,Missed chance,"In a perfect series on video editing this book, which should have been the icing on the cake, was a severe blow: a startling amount of mistakes in the text and a bad build-up. It was helpfull in getting through the programm but missed the flair of the other volumes. (with advanced editing by digital film tree being the real juwel)"
1,Disappointing!,"This book should be renamed ""DVD Studio Pro 2: Apple Amateur Training Series"". Although it's possible to struggle through the book, it is poorly written and full of errors and omissions. It's difficult to imagine how this book ever made it to the printer in its present state. Apple should find another author to write the Pro Training Series book for DVD Studio Pro 3 - or at least insist that the follow-up be proof-read and accurate. Save your money and hope that the next edition is better."
3,"Compared to other ""Pro Training Series""...","As far as the Apple Pro Training Series is concerned, I usually find their titles to be quite helpful. In fact I own the following titles:Final Cut Pro 4Final Cut Pro 4 AdvancedShake 3DVD Studio Pro 2Logic Pro 7Logic Pro 7 AdvancedHaving said that, this book helped me quite a bit to get up and running with DVDSP in a short time, though there were several times when I was required to figure out what the author ""meant"" versus what was actuallly printed on the page (as other reviewers have mentioned). The only thing is, some reviewers have made it sound a little more difficult than it was to get around these typos. It would generally only take me a couple minutes to figure out the problem and continue with the lesson, and also served to reinforce my understanding of the program itself in most cases.Overall, it was ok, but by far not the best in the series"
3,What?No Rory Gallagher?,"This is a good album but it saddens me to see that the Greatest of all Fender Strat players Rory Gallagher is'nt on there.What a shame.Fender decide to do an exact replica of Rorys battered Strat,but he's omitted from this mediocre line up.The mind boggles."
5,This book has been very helpful in a multitude of situations,"Silver Bullets has been a lifesaver in some cases for us and in others has enabled us to put some great programs together for Boy Scout Troops and Explorer Scouts. I have also used some of its activities in a classroom setting. We currently do not know where our one and only copy is, so we are anxious to get another."
2,Not for adults,"I was trying to locate something helpful for use in a more business-like setting and made a mistake with this one. Seems like this book is for activities aimed at kids 12 and under (though most of the photos show adults doing some of this sutff). This would NOT go over well with the adults I work with and I can't even imagine it outside of work. One activity is called ""Basic Killer""---real nice with the increase in violence lately. Also, though some of the activities are indoors, it seemed that the vast majority were handled outdoors. Then there are the props...anyone have a spare parachute? I was disappointed and am returning it."
2,BOR-ING,"I'm new to this genre and I don't agree with the review. For this to be a Christian fiction romance, it had entirely too much sex. I know they say that ""sex sells,"" but I'm trying to move away from sex-driven novels. The first story by Sims was sooo boring and unrealistic. It moved entirely too fast. It was only 100 pages or so but it took me 2 weeks to get through her story when usually it takes 1 hour to read 100 pages. Natasha, Natalie and Kim's stories were the same. Long and drawn out. This could have been a good romance novel if it wasn't so unreal."
1,Com[plete Landdesigner 3D,"I bought this program hoping to design a new garden plot. Before I could do that I had to design my home, doors, windows, and several other areas before I could get to the garden planner."
4,Rare footage a must have.,"I bought this to replace a VHS version. The Segovia part alone is a rare look into what he could do, even though the quality of the film isn't that great. The 4 stars rating is because of the film quality."
5,Excellent; thought provoking,Though I was unfamiliar with Fanon before reading this book; I found this biography to be fascinating. Well written and very interesting.
4,DEWALT 2 Inch Finish Nail,"These aren't usually in stock in our local big box store, so we were happy to see them here at such a good price. Ran a ton of these through the nailer in a recent project and didn't have one jam, and they hold great. Highly recommended."
5,I nailed it,"The product was a little pricey for the size job I needed to do. But I can't count the number of times I've needed a finish nailer and didn't have it.I didn't buy one previously because of needing a decent size compresser - hoses, ets. But I saw this cordless electric one and knew it was going to be the right tool for me.So far, I've only done about 300 ft of baseboard moulding. But this thing has been great. I charged the battery once, and it keeps going. Ususally when you put it away for a few weeks, a battery needs re-charged - but this one still has power.I've only had one nail jamb. I clearly hit something behind the sheetrock that was inpenetrable. Clearing the jamb was easy.I'd buy this product again."
5,Great product,"I ordered this set after comparing prices at my local craft store and Walmart. This price, by far, is unbeatable.I used it the first day I got it and ambitiously tried to slice through 8 sheets of felt. I was so impressed. It cut through like butter.Great product."
4,For beginners,"A nice set, especially for those who start quilting and work on smaller projects. I especially like it for travelling, for I quilt while I vistit family in the USA."
3,Return issues.,There was nothing wrong with product. It turned out to be a duplicate and had to be sent back. Note JoAnn products on line can not be returned to a local store. Definite bummer!
2,The rotary cutter not functioning,"Hi,The Fiskars Rotary Cutter isnt sharp enough and i am finding it difficult to cut the cloth for stitching the quilt. Can i return this item and get a refund or get a new cutter.Thanks."
2,Dull,"If you're looking for something to gnaw through material, you've come to the right place. I've never tried to cut with anything so dull. I'm extremely disappointed. Fiskars used to make good products....not so anymore. Time to go with made in the USA only."
4,Great for small space,I am making my first quilt and saw this package for nearly $50 in the store. Finding it cheaper on Amazon was great. I don't live in a big apartment and have to do my work on the kitchen table. Eventually my family has to eat so everything has to be put away. It all stores nicely. The blade is nice and sharp. I'm happy with the product so far.
3,it's just ok - personally I recommend a much larger mat,This mat is OK for small quilting pieces. I do not recommend this mat for fashion sewing.I purchase replacement blades in a retail store when they go on sale for 40% off. The blades are kind of expensive so I recommend treating them with care. Always wipe them clean before you are done using them and put them back in the plastic container so they don't get dinged up.You can get larger mats in retail stores. I don't recommend ordering large mats because of the oversize shipping charges.
3,Not very self healing,"For as much as I paid for this, I really expected it to last a lot longer. I made *one* jeans quilt (65x80 inches in final size) and the mat was ruined part-way through making it. When cutting heavy fabrics like denim you have to press hard for the rotary cutting tool to cut all the way through, even then you have to move it back and forth a few times to get it to cut all the way through. This destroys the mat in short order. There are deep grooves and chunks missing out of it now. I think this thing would be great for very lightweight material, but no matter what you're cutting you have to be careful not to press too hard or you'll ruin the mat. It's disappointing and not worth the high cost. I hope I can find a better cutting mat out there somewhere that will stand up to heavy pressing.Editing to add that I've been informed I need to change the blade more often to avoid damaging the mat. I guess even ""self healing"" has its limits."
2,Its compact but pretty useless in the long run !,"I purchased this particular rotary cutter because I beginning a new hobby and did not want to spend much on ""just a rotary cutter"" .. BIG MISTAKEThe fiskars blade was blunt and I had to go two - three times just to get 2 layers of fabric cut which ended up being uneven cuts with a lot of waste. I was so frustrated at the end of day 3 and decided to ask a friend who lent me her Gingher and needless to say it worked way better! As much as I would have like this quilting set to work for me I decided to return it and buy a Gingher instead. I went beyond making the 3 initial quilts I had planned and enjoy quilting :)My advice would be to test out a variety of rotary cutters if you can before you buy one. If you are serious about your hobby I would suggest you invest in something more worthwhile."
3,Much to be desired.,"I first bought this book as a required text for a couple of my modules in school. This book is very effective when it comes to presenting the mathematical formula, examples and graphs. However, the discussions of tests and soil behaviour left much to be desired.This book would be suitable for people who just started on soil mechanics."
1,"Supposed ""one hand release"" completely false. These require a secondary tool to get them to release.","If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I wish Irwin would have followed this advice.After clamping down, the only way I could get the pliers to release was by prying them apart with a screwdriver. There is no mechanical mechanism for releasing the pliers. (On other models, there is a lever between the two handles.) I have no idea how they'd expect anyone to open them one-handed.I contacted Irwin to see if I have a defective set. I'll update this review if I hear back from them. I'll be returning them all the same.Update 8/13/2012: Irwin told me my unit was defective, and told me to return it for another. I did so, and the replacement had the same problem, so back it goes as well. Avoid this tool - it's terrible."
5,Car Warriors Book,"A fun book especially if one is into the Car Wars gaming environment. A fun book anyhow, written for anyone interested in cars or wargaming, but not neccessarily so."
2,OK - but a must read for Farren Fans,"Mick's at it again - 'it' being the post-apocalypse scenario he is so fond of (the irrepressible, Byronesque anarchist in him?). An obviously commissioned novelization job (there is no better way to describe this - err, job) for the Car Wars role playing series, looks like Mick wrote this one purely to earn a wage. But nonetheless, a pleasing patishe, full of Mick-references (spot the names! Spot the characters which had previously peopled his other older works! Esp ''Text of Festival'' and parts of the DNA Cowboys' Quadrology involving raids on villages). Good clean (well, maybe not so clean!) fun at US$5. Read it and pass it onto your other Mick-loving friends. B-)Visit Mick's webpagehttp://www.thanatosoft.freeserve.co.uk/"
3,145th Street: Short Stories,"In the book there are ten short stories. Each of the are different but are in the same settings with some of the same characters. The story I liked best was ""Kitty and Mack."" It took place at a school. Mack was a great baseball player until he go hit with a bullet and had to get his leg amputaded. At that point Kitty and Mack were going through relantionship problems. Then they worked it out fine. I thought this was a breeze to read. I didn't like all the stories in the book, but i didlike some. I recommend this book to young adults because they can relate to it better."
3,Fat Joe's wedding,This stories theme was about keeping the good friends you have and gathering together!
2,145th Street,I think i should give this to my sister cause she likes books with stories in it because im in to action books that involve drugs and guns and girls and robbings stuff like that dont get me wrong it was an ok book but i just dont like reading a story and then i get into to it but then it cuts into a whole other story i wouldved really liked it but it just cuts out the story and i dont like stories in a book i like it to be one main subject thru the whole book for u can get into to it and see what happens i knew what was gonna happen in this book it was gonna get good then it was gonna change stories
1,Late,"I ordered this book on September 15, 2008. Today is October 18th, and I have yet to see this book. I contacted the owner but he/she did not return the communication."
4,145th Street,"In the book 145th Street Short Stories by Walter Dean Myers he talks about all things that happen in this street. There are some gansters but best of all some great friends that are always there when you need them. In this book you will meet some teenagers that are faced with hard decisions.WhatI liked about the book was how the author used descriptive language ,I can vizualize and connect. I like almost all of the stories because its like you learn lesson from the story.In this book I connected a lot but I learned three lessons for life.I recommend this book to anyone that is in 5th grade and up, but I think its more of a middle school book.In this book you will learn some new things. Read on to discover a book that has some interesting stories or experiences."
3,Remove purchased books from wish list,I only wanted to ask why purchased books are not deleted from your wish list. I accidently ordered twice.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"First off, the picture on the product page (as of November 07) is NOT of the V-Stand bag. I don't know what bag that is, but the V-Stand bag is clearly not that long. More to the point, however, is the fact that the V-Stand bag has no pockets at all and is sized to hold the folded-up V-Stand and basically nothing else. Also, there is no padding, which is a bit disappointing, given the weight of the V-Stand. Yes, you can squeeze a cable or two in this bag, but you certainly can't store any of the V-Stand accessories, such as the 2nd tier or the mic stand. The bag seems reasonably well made, but it doesn't give you a lick of usefulness beyond the one fundamental task it was made for. If you use any accessories, I'd recommend finding a bag that holds the stand as well as whatever accessories you use."
3,Hugo Boss Splash.,I was disappointed because it was so small. I guess I should have known because it said 0.16. Just can't visualize that size. My own fault.
4,"Great Cumbia, Tejano and Mexican Music.","First heard them on the TV Program 'Austin City Limits' and liked their sound and style, sure wished they had more albums available. I like the Mariachi sound."
1,Lack of Information,If you are marketing a product to someone who does not know anything about your product you should give information about it. How does it install? Does it adhere to the window directly? Does it work with all windows? When I wish to remove it does it come off without residue? Your marketing for this product lacks information.
3,POLKA HITS A BUST,"While you do get 25 polkas etc for your money, the sound quality is poor on most of the recordings. The ""Blue Skirt Waltz"" and ""No Beer in Heaven"" are flat and weak, particularly when compared to Frankie Yankovic's renditions. A few of the Polish vocals add somewhat to the overall acceptance. Don't waste your money on this unless you really need some of the numbers. Suggest you first listen to the CD before buying.....wish I did."
4,Great Polka Collection,"While the sound quality on a few songs are not the greatest, the rest of the CD is terrific. Good sing along. Caution though while driving, your toes are really tappin'."
2,4 real?????,give this hentai 2 stars because there r only two hentai scenes.... and they are not even that good. Really i can download better things 4 free.Just a waste of money 2 scenes......... 2mins each. My advise... go to some web page and download a 5min clip 4 free will be better than this movie.
1,CALORIES!!!!,"As someone who watches my calories I am appalled by the number of calories not only in a serving (a pathetic 2 measly sticks) but in the whole box... a whopping 3000+ calories. I know, unbelievable. It's the asian worlds scheme to make Americans even more obese.'murica. Not even once."
2,untitled,I liked it very much.I would give it five stars but when I got the pocky all of them were melted together and it was a mess!
2,Not Tasty,"I bought these ""treats"" for my son because he had read so much about them and I am glad I only bought one, they pretty much tasted awful."
3,"I wasn't overly impressed, YMMV.","Take an unsalted, thin pretzel stick and dip in chocolate(think Nestle Flipz without the salt).Sure, they're tasty, but these are grossly overpriced.Glad I tried them, won't buy again."
1,Miss the Mark,"Miss the MarkAll these other reviews all sound so?professionally done.All I can say is I like to read, and I read 50 books a year. This one just didn?t make the grade. While the point of view flip-flops from one main character to the other, the entire book is written in a passive voice that almost hypnotizes the reader every time she?s forced into reading ?was? after ?was? after ?was? after ?was.? Even the climax occurs off-stage.What ?was? the point of that?Mr. Anthony?s freshman effort is a pale comparison of the same old stuff that didn?t work in the 90?s.Half a star out of five?and I?m not one of these ?5-Star Ringers.?"
5,A Great Study Guide,"I'm a pastor who uses this study guide in my Galatians Small Group, and sometimes for sermon exegesis. One of the great things about this guide is that Stott asks a lot of great questions which build on each other. For a bible study leader, his questions are excellent discussion starters. Some of the most penetrating questions we have dealt with in our study of Galatians have come straight out of this guide.I would recommend a different IVP author for a matching commentary...check out Ann Jervis on Galatians or Ron Fung (NICNT). Those two seem to be more interactive on the key issues throughout Galatians than Stott is in his commentary. But for a study guide, this one here is the best I have found. I recommend you get this. It will help you a lot!The reason I recommend a commentary to go with this, is because Stott doesn't give a lot of information about Galatians in this book. It's important to note that this is not a commentary, only a study guide."
3,excellent group study - overpriced however.,We are really enjoying this study. We got two solid weeks of study out of the first chapter. Just so many secondary conversations spring up from the questions that our group finds we are having broad ranging conversations about our faith every week. Much better than some other studies of like format we have used.Books are a bit excessively priced so I took atwo stars away. It's really just a big pamphlet.
2,Catholic Evangelization:the Heart of Ministry,"One book was not in good condition,not sure I would use Amazon again.Also shipping costs are way to costly, making the price overly much."
1,Have to work to read this one...,"This author knows how to write, but didn't use that knowledge in creating this book. Trying to follow the plot (?) is hard, hard work. We meander from one disconnected character/event to another so haphazardly that the mind is stressed trying to put them all together, eventually. And that ending?? Is that supposed to make sense out of all the ridiculous happenings that preceded? No, Case Histories was great, but unless you have a masochistic streak, leave this one behind."
4,One Good Turn certainly deserves another,"Jackson Brodie is back in this follow-up to CASE HISTORIES. Brodie and his girlfriend, Julia, are in Edinburgh for the opening of her latest play when the now retired PI gets involved in a murder case. But first, Brodie is witness to an awful beating -- a beating that is also witnessed by mystery writer Martin Canning. Then Brodie finds a dead girl whose body disappears before anyone else can find it. Meanwhile, a real estate mogul lies unconscious in a hospital while his wife is left to untangle his messes.Everything about Kate Atkinson's books is so carefully clever and fantastic! I imagine that she must have fun building all the tiny connections in her stories. Brodie is loveable as ever and the plot is intricate but never confusing."
4,Greatly Entertaining,"Set in Scotland, this greatly entertaining, dense-with-coincidences mystery, #2 of the Jackson Brodie series, features great characters, plot twists, and and several laugh-out-loud moments. Kate Atkinson is a clever, engaging, intelligent writer. I've become a big fan and recommend her books to readers who relish clever mysteries with an ironic tone--a tone, unfortunately, completely absent from the recent BBC Jackson Brodie dramatizations."
5,"Wry humor, twisted plot","The plot twists and turns. At first, it may be difficult to understand the rhythmn of Ms. Atkinson's novel because the story doesn't unfold chronologically nor do you follow only one character through the entire plot. Instead, characters bump into one another and there is liberal use of flashbacks. As a result, I found ""One Good Turn"" to be a real treat. I loved the mordant observations of everyday life and found the frequent asides to be hilarious."
2,silly,"Having enjoyed the intricacy of Case Histories I was eager to read this -- but what a disappointment. It felt like she was so obsessed with adding more layers and more characters and more twists that she forgot they all had to make sense together. The silliest part: (spoilers) I suppose *one* ridiculous divine-intervention plot-altering death isn't out of place in a book calling itself a ""jolly"" murder mystery, so when the dog suddenly and without explanation ups and dies in mid-lunge at Jackson (as we discover after a chapter cliffhanger), I felt cheated but kept going. But when the perfectly healthy Russian prostitute trips, hits her head, and dies then and there -- oh, come on. That's for really mediocre fourth-rate noir films, not a novel from a writer who I *thought* was sharp and perceptive. You could just see her writing herself into a corner and forgetting she had a backspace-delete key. At first I'd been happy to hear there'd be a third Jackson Brodie -- but now not so much."
2,"Slow, a bit confusing, and full of holes.","The beginning was character jumping like crazy. Every chapter concentrated on tid-bits of one character (there are about 5 or 6 characters you have to keep straight at the beginning of the book) After forcing myself to read farther into it, the book became somewhat interesting but then the end left me annoyed. Everything was just a coincidence revolving around a bonehead thug? Martin's time in Russia had NOTHING to do with the pot, yet there seemed to be a connection for 90% of the book. In the end the story just didn't add up."
4,A Page Turner,I read this novel in two days. Jackson a retired private detective and policeman from Case Histories is back. His life has moved on and he now is involved with Julia from Case Histories. Atkinson has many interesting characters in this novel and some that I cared about. The narrative moves back and forth in time. There's a few stories going on which all come together at the end. I was surprized at the ending because I never saw it coming. I recommend this book. I liked it more than Case Histories.
1,One of the Worst Books I've ever Endured!,"If this book hadn't been a gift from my husband, I would've set it aside early on. I'm stunned to read the other reviews - I thought it was awful. With so many good books to read, I'm sorry I wasted my time on this one."
5,A perfect piece of literature!,"This is what a great book is all about: Intrigue, surprise, brilliant, witty writing and great character development. A perfect mix of can't-put-down and great writing, Atkinson is up there with my all-time favorites, Jim Crace, John Banville, and Ian McKewan.HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES TO READ GOOD BOOKS!"
5,another great read by Kate,I love reading Kate's stories. She captures you from page 1 to the end when it all starts to make sense. She brilliantly evolves Jackson and uses details from previous stories. Love it!
2,Nice Humorous Tone but Sloppy Conclusion,"I enjoyed meeting the characters. Julia and Jackson were a funny pair. I liked the wise cracking tone of the narrator (Kate Atkinson). But the ending left me with too many questions. Unlike the Russian dolls who fit neatly, one inside the other, this story just fell over sloppily. Who is Tatiana? Who is the father of Julia's baby? And what of Martin, who and what is he anyway? Author mentions that not one person thought of calling hospitals when Graham vanished. This can be believed for a day perhaps but not 2 or 3 days when many people were searching desparately for him. Gloria came across as a bitter battle axe, passive for many years and now playing catch up. The detail of her dropping cash as she sped through a tacky housing development was forced."
4,Wow! I love Atkinson's writing,"I had read Case Histories and could not WAIT to get another book by Kate Atkinson. I was not disappointed. But don't take my word for it...Stephen King called this the BEST mystery of the decade (that is written on the back of the book cover) and it got superb reviews in The New York Times.THE PLOT: Road rage sets off a series of events that leave Jackson Brodie, ex-cop, in the mddle of not ONE, but several mysteries.What made me really love this book was the writing style of Atkinson. SHe has a way of making her characters unique, believable and also setting up great twists and turns. What more could a reader want?"
2,"Content great, formatting abysmal","Love the story and the writing, but the formatting of this eBook is terrible. On almost every page there is at least one word incorrectly broken up with a hyphen :""col-ors"" ""him-self"" Very ann-oying."
2,"Good story, but...","The book is good, but the editing errors are so distracting that it's hard to keep focused on the story. The punctuation (Kindle version) is so bad that it seems like it's been translated by someone who doesn't speak English, like the instructions that usually come with cheap, made-in-China stuff. If we have to pay more than full price (Kindle 9.99, paperback 5.99) we should definitely get better quality than this!"
2,None,I had to stop reading this book on my Kindle because the formatting was so terrible. The book is excellent but I honestly can't finish it; the formatting just keeps getting worse as the book goes on. It's painful.
2,"First-rate writing, second-rate novel","I just finished my second Kate Atkinson novel, One Good Turn. Not as satisfying as Case Histories, the novel pushes Atkinson's penchant for free-association tangents to an extreme. The writing is consistently good/engaging, but the plot development gets distractingly self-indulgent in postponing the climaxes of events, one of the most egregious being when the author leaves an attack dog in mid-air as it leaps toward anti-hero Brodie.Most annoying, however, is a last-minute revelation about one of the characters, Gloria, in an effort to tie up loose ends. You can't get us inside a character's head to the degree that Atkinson does, revealing/analyzing Gloria's thoughts about the most trivial details of her life, and then expect us to buy that this woman did something both momentous and immoral and never bothered to ruminate about it. Cheap trick.Atkinson is a first-rate writer, but this one doesn't do justice to her talents."
4,The Perils of Road Rage,"When Kate Atkinson dipped her toes into the crime genre, I was a bit skeptical... 'Case Histories' was not bad but it didn't really make a huge impact on me. But 'One Good Turn' was brilliant in the way it connected all the disparate threads thru a seemingly innocuous road rage incident - ""you say coincidence, I say connection"", to mangle a quote from returning character, the retired sleuth Jackson Brodie.Atkinson is so comfortable in her new found niche in the literary detective story that she even inserts a central character who's a crime author, specialising in Nancy Drew type mysteries, a parody of the genre she's writing in.It's the kind of murder mystery that makes you applaud in the epilogue... a very satisfying read."
3,Learn more about horses,"If you want to learn more about horses, horse competitions, and behind the scene preparation of all who are involved, then you must see this documentary.Grant you the inexperience of the interviewer might distract you, but try to go beyond that, and listen to the experience and dedication of all the professional people who were interviewed. This information alone is worth the investment.This is a rare opportunity for children and adults to gain equestrian insight."
4,A good buy,"It is full of detailed drawings of armor and weapons so in case you wish to know what something looks like without having to search all over the place for it, this book is worth it. It does not have a large amount of text explaining the weapons and armor though."
5,Brutal honesty and courage,"This is a must read. A fascinating, gripping story filled with life lessons. The Nakatanis are honoring their children with their display of brutal honesty and courage!As a parent of a gay child, as someone who also grew up in Hawaii, the emotions of the Nakatanis are not unlike emotions that many parents in small town America might feel when their children disclose their sexual orientation. Although the American public's awareness of the diversity of sexuality is increasing rapidly, unfortunately, that knowledge is not widespread."
4,Buy more than one if you switch between caps....,"I love mine, and had to buy more, because it will separate eventually if you move it from hat to hat. It is easily repaired with gorilla glue, but I wish it was welded...... It is easier to use than most. Buy spare markers if you are in the woods much......."
3,Great...but cheaper at local hardware store,"Yes, this part is exactly what I needed to replace the original one that had come with my Toto toilet but had started leaking after 5yrs. When I called the Toto company, they recommended I just go down to my local Lowes hardware store and pick one up. It only cost $11...barely half the advertised cost of this online offering. I installed it in a snap and its been working great for the last month."
2,Cheaper Elsewhere -Not good if you have higher water pressure,"This fill valve is a lot cheaper at Lowes. I have also found out that it does not have a very high pressure tolerance. If your water pressure is over 60 pounds this valve will run constantly through the overflow tube, wasting a lot more water than you are saving.I'm going to replace it with an 'original' toto valve and see if that is the issue or if all the new ones are the same.An update. I tried a second 528T and it had the same issue. Leaked water into the overflow tube when the pressure reached around 70 pounds. I talked to Lavelle (Korky) support and they stated that the valve is rated for 60-80 pounds and could take awhile to seat. After two weeks of leaking water I changed to the 'new' Toto TSU16A, which initially had a lot of complaints. It does not leak. Now we will see how long it lasts but at least I'm not wasting water.It's also cheaper than the Korky valve if you buy it through a plumbing supply store."
5,Perfect replacement for the TOTO OEM GMax,For our ST 743S Drake model. I would certainly agree w/others who suggested removing as much of the excess water from the tank as possible. I used a couple of beach towels on the floor under the immediate tank area when I removed the old valve.What I didn't realize is that this unit is height adjustable (which is easily done to get yours to the proper level) but I overlooked the WHITE plastic tab lock that snaps into place to prevent the valve height from moving once properly adjusted. So - avoid my mistake - and read the install paperwork closely.It works perfectly. No leaks no issues and quick fills.
5,Easy to install,Easy to install and fixed the leaking and noise from my toilet. Took about 20 minutes to switch it out.
4,replacement float valve,This fill valve made strange noises and did not turn off completely. I had to remove the blue cover in order for it to work properly. So far it is working just fine with the blue cover removed.
5,Warning! This book makes you think.,"Bloody Amazing!Now my Art Director and I can't wait to work there, as soon as we get back from our Australian Adventure in Advertising...We have another dream to live and that's at St.Lukes."
5,Best business book I've ever read. It ended too quickly,"I envisioned someday building a company like St. Luke's even before I picked up the book. I read an article about them in Fast Company and knew I had to pick it up. Amazing ""too good to be true"" stuff that I believe can really happen if everyone involved is on the same page. Unfortunately, politics and red tape take over in 99.9% of all companies. Egos get in the way and everything the creators had in mind has changed.It's for people who want to be in business to make a great living, not necessarily great money!"
5,One of the best books I have ever read.,This is a really excellent book. It gives you the opportunity to consider the way your organisation is structured and how it works. The book is very readable. You cannot wait to get back to it. It didn't seem to be a 'business' book and therefore something one 'should' be reading but rather a book about a way to live your life and how that can and should involve work. Somehow the people at St. Lukes seem to run a very successful business and at the same time understand that people are humans also and have lives outside work. This book is now more relevant than ever as the pace of life seems to get ever faster. Read the book and I am certain you will get much from it but will you have the courage to put it into practice?
2,Think Twice,"Enigma's strength, beautifully illustrated in their 1991 release MCMXC A.D., was its mystery and eroticism, achieved through the then-innovative use of Gregorian chants with hip-hop and trance persussion, layered with whispered lyrics in french. THAT was good.A decade later, Michael Cretu tries unsuccessfully to extend this now gimmicky approach to a collection of new songs that don't really say anything ""new."" Worse, these tracks sound like the same stuff Enigma did on E1; just done badly. Same sound effects on the synthesizer ... but this time around, almost -NO- instrumental tracks. In fact, Cretu himself sings (!) on many of the tracks, and his voice - thin and weak - is more of a distraction than a feature, and is generally not good.The lyrics themselves are simplistic and somewhat trite.Overall, this album is definitely illustrative of Enigma's signature sound, but quite lacking in every quality that made E1 the astonishing work that it was."
5,the child in us,"The child in us was my first contact with a Indian song. Not only that song is touchable. Each song, specially Beyond the invisible and prism of life takes you away...into an enigma of light, that is for me the conslusion of the CD...after everything...there is the light."
5,A warm place,"Enigma's most mature album. A delicate blend of soft beats and subtle layers. Listen and you'll pick out new sounds each time. Unfortunately Cretu's voice is rather harsh at times- especially on Why ? Which is a fantastic track when the choir comes in at its mid point and MC sings without shouting. It would be better if he refrained from straining so much - alas that's not to be ( E4). Of course I can't really say that as then Cretu wouldn't be Cretu.... Anyway the subtle use of chant samples here is quite wonderful. I love the more muted sound. Everything is warm. The sound evolves and envelops, surrounding slowly. E3 is more lush than its two previous counterparts and provides a much more cohesive emotional journey. A journey I think you'd like to take."
2,"Get ready to mark ""Not Helpful"" Enigma fans...","Okay, I'm sorry if all you guys want is glowing 5 stars reviews. I wanted to like this album, I did. But I don't. Why not? I really liked past Enigma albums, and I loved the sensual, lushness of the music, but now the male vocalist has decided he needs to sing WAY more, and he's is essence, for me, ruined the entire album. He is a very poor vocalist, almost sounding like a hoarse, untutored Phil Collins. Ugh! I just wish I could buy a copy of this album with the male vocals mixed out, because then it would get 4-5 stars easily. My favorite songs on the album are the absolutely breathtaking Shadows In Silence and the great Almost Full Moon. It should come as no surprise that these tracks also have a paucity of the male vocals.In short, if you're a big Enigma fan of their past albums, you might not like this one because it has a lot of jarring poorly done vocals by the male singer."
5,THE BEST ONE YET!,I HAVE BEEN AN ENIGMA FAN FOR YEARS AND I THINK THIS IS THE BEST ONE YET! IT HAS THE SAME ENIGMA STYLE WITH A LITTLE TWIST..... SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT I RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY IT I GUARATEE YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED!
2,Marginal - Not MCMXC! Some good/ some poor songs,Too much singing (screaming) and lacks the hypnotic depth of previous recordings.
5,THE BEST--BY FAR,"I love this cd.""PRISM OF LIFE"" is my favorite in a long,long time. I want more--LOTS MORE A BIG FAN TIM"
4,"A powerful, haunting CD, but is it their best?","I must admit, I have listened to this album countless times and never seem to become tired of it. Songs such as ""Shadows In Silence"" and ""The Roundabout"" are particularily evocative songs, and are my favorites on this album. Overall, the album conveys the same feelings of power and mystery that the first two albums did, but the greater use of vocals hindered it. It is the wonderful blending of drums and chant that drew many people to Enigma, including myself, and I believe that the use of more and more vocals will only obscure the elements that defined the group in the first place. As far as the fourth album is concerned however, I can hardly wait. Hopefully it will be packed with the haunting chants and pounding of drums ( with less emphasis on vocals ) that most Enigma fans desire."
5,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS,"must be one of my favourites,if you like this and opera you must try Emma Shapplin-Carmine Meo it is a cross between opera @enigma ,almost like Malcolm McLarlens Fans which introduced me to opera in an enlarged way!!!"
5,Unbelievable. Fantastic. A must have,Enigma never ceases to amaze me with their unique style and passion. Michael Cretu is a musical genius. Buy this album. And buy the first 2 as well. (Don't bother with the limited edition of album 1 unless you're a huge fan. The four remixes aren't worth the exorbitant fee)
4,Great Story,"Originally I thought I would hate this movie because of the subtitles but I quickly fell in love with the characters and the story. This is not your typical horror movie it's more of a thriller and almost a love story. The father has had some bad luck in his career and tries very hard to please and care for his family although his wife's mother (of whom you never see) is really judgmental and criticizes his every effort.He moves the family to a new town in hopes of a better opportunity after the family was forced to split for several years. The daughter has been totally brainwashed by her grandmother and never allows her dad that second chance (attitude, back talk etc) but realizes his caring efforts at the very end.The little boy is sooo cute and very likable as well. Don't sleep on this movie, it's actually very good."
4,Good Suspense,this movie was very entertaining. It had a lot of suspense and some scares. The plot was okay and the acting was good as well. It was enjoyable and watchable. I would say its a good movie for a rainy day.
3,"Temper, temper little girl","Although it gives a nice view of historical Oxford ( as a University town in the late 1800's) life, the preteen girl seems to be encouraged to act out anger. This kind of behavior isn't well received in any age.On the opposite the woman's right movement activity of young andolder women in public affairs in the case of Jumbo the elephantis important in English history. Women in Spain or Italyof the same period would probably have not been allowedsuch protests."
2,Why is the kindle price so high!?!,"I am very interested in this book and am an avid Kindle reader. So I have to wonder why a publisher chooses to charge so much for a digital version??? Ridiculous. Won't be buying new, so now the publisher/ author won't get any. Just silly and disappointing. To ignore a strong trend of electronic reading, it is just ignorant to think many will pay this way over inflated price."
4,Maybe needs an update,"This book was perfect in 1989. However, with the advent of the DVD's and VHS tapes which contains almost all the episodes, including those which are not in syndication, and the Sci-Fi Channel re-runs, it might need a brief update. Anyway, it's one of the best tv shows review book in the market."
5,quality reference for the true Twilight Zone fan.,Without a doubt this is the best reference book for the true Twilight Zone fan anywhere. I loaned this book out once before and never got it back. This copy I just bought isn't leaving my sight.
2,4 1/2 Stars??? Really?,"It's great to have a companion book devoted entirely to the Twilight Zone, but too bad that this is it! There is some great information but far too much time is wasted by Zicree ""explaining"" what is wrong with a particular episode. You don't have to be a huge fan-boy to write a book like this but he really just nit-picks and rants on and on. He actually writes in a few of his criticisms how it would have been better if they did this or that and so on. Seriously Zicree, I'll stick to the original stories vs. your bumbling suggestions on how to make these classics ""better"". He gets into science and opinion that is just ridiculous.I'm actually shocked by how many 5 star reviews this book has gotten. I give it a couple of stars because he does cover every episode and every now and then may actually have an interesting tidbit about one of the episodes. However, more times than not he just rambles on and complains."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Buyer beware! I just received my copy of The Twilight Zone Companion from Amazon and discovered that page 41, the opening page for the episode ""Walking Distance"" was missing. Instead there was a reprint of the acknowledgement section from the beginning of the book. Thinking that it must have been a fluke, i went over to my neighborhood bookstore and looked at their copy. Same problem, no page 41 and only a partial review and description of Walking Distance. I am returning my copy and keeping my fingers crossed that when I reorder, I will get a complete edition of the book. Very sloppy editing and compilation by the publisher."
5,A Great Companion,"The Twilight Zone Companion is a wonderful book to just read or to have with you while watching the show. It gives you inside information about each episode,the characters,writers,producers/directors and etc.It's a must-have resource for any Twilight Zone fan!!!"
3,The Best Episode guide so far still needs improvement!,"Although this is the best episode guide on TZ, the author fails to accurately analyze many of the shows. At times he seems to randomly nitpick and bash episodes that fans have loved for years. In addition, some of the shows receive only a few lines of analysis, while other shows receive very lengthy and detailed coverage. However, if you are a very big TZ fan, like me, you need this book. Some of the comments by Zicree are insightful, and his coverage of the series is the most extensive thus far."
3,Engaging movie with Carvey.,"I think since Dana Carvey was the star of this movie, that's what got it rolling and made it fun to watch. The plot is a typical hollywood style plot but he made it different. He's sweet, funny, and sad in this movie about a con man who not only cons a rich family but also himself and then feels guilty about it only when it's too late. It's a must-see if you're a Carvey fan. They best part is when he sings ""Born to be Wild"" to impress the girl."
4,Entertaining.,"Entertaining movie. I love Dana from SNL and feel like a lot of his work outside of SNL was underrated. He is a very funny guy and this is a great movie to just sit back and unwind to. 4-stars because it could be better, but still, lots of laughs!"
4,Really funny!,I remember this movie from T.V. and a trully enjoy it a lot. It is perhaps the only Dana Carvey movie really worth watching. For those who like silly 80's romantic comedies this one is for you.
4,Dana Carvey's Best Movie,"I liked this movie the first time I saw it and have watched it several times over the years. It is a bit dated now, but it is an original story with a lot of good laughs. A great movie to have fun and escape for a couple of hours. Enjoy and have a laugh - it is good for your health. :)"
2,Its not all that.,"This CD is average at best. It's not bad, but at the same time its not classic. Part-time RSO fans (if any) need not apply."
5,Worked Fine,"My wife was in agony after injuring her tailbone (sat down hard on a plastic object), and needed relief, especially in the car. An inflatable donut helped, but this was much better. It fit the car well, gave plenty of support (she is petite, at 100 lbs), and has allowed the injury to gradually get better over a month of use. It is made by DMI, and listed as Camel color, though I would call it dark tan or light brown, definitely not the light grey appearing in the listing. The cover zips off for cleaning, if you need to. It shipped extremely rapidly."
2,Coccyx Cushion Goes FLAT!,"The cushion itself was quite comfortable at first but then just seems to flatten out with a few weeks of use. Cushion needs to be firmer and of better quality material? Otherwise, no complaints."
4,Tanner Review- Coccyx Cushion,Bought 6 of the tan velour...one for each car and my seats in the house. Has worked out beautifully and am pleased with the product.
1,DON'T BUY THIS SET!!!,"DON'T BUY THIS SET!!! It's not a boxed set just 4 seasons in separate cheap packages. Don't be fooled in paying an extra $44 (at $207)for the 4 seasons when you can buy separately the same seasons for a total of $162 for the same website and maybe cheaper in some stores... I bought this set and I've been had, now I have to return the package for a refund minus shipping costs."
1,Women with no morals,"I was told by friends that this was a hip show, but I must say that the immoral behavior of these women, their obsessions, their fascinations make me happy I neither live in New York City nor am I likely to hang out at the sorts of places they frequent. I think they will have some explaining to do in the after-life. Hopefully Ashcroft will get laws passed so he can lock these people up or at least force them to wear ""scarlet a's to show just what sort of people they are."
2,Great program but DVD is terrible!!!!,"The show itself is great, I imagine most people buying the collection are already fans of the show. The setup is terrible!!! Buyer beware! You can't play the entire DVD straight through, and you end up having to press play a few times to get each episode going. Also, there's no title or synopsis on the cover, so if you're looking for a particular episode, you either have to put each DVD in, or have a great memory. Very disappointing!!!!"
4,A great place to start,This is the first book published in the US that shows a 4WD can be used for more than trashing the backcountry. If you want to start expedition style driving this is the place to start.
4,Very Happy,"Grasper is such a nice book!! Not only for children, it's a metaphore for life!!!What if you stay in your comfort zone, it's safe and outside is where the magic happens, is where you learn and encounter new things!!"
2,Waste of money,"If you live in the UK or have a BT HTC mobile S620,don't buy this product. It comes with American flat two pin mains plugs (useless in uk three pin sockets) so could'nt use the charger or Docking Cradle with charger, and the mobile would not fit into the cradle. The cradle is too narrow at the bottom.I was advised I could return for a refund, but the postage & packing are not refundable.Considering the items were 9 odd and the postage was 10 odd it was'nt worth the hassle so have kept the items but have a car charger for 20 quid.Bit pricey."
3,Its a ruler and???,Its a good ruler and it works. Good to have. Just remember to hold it down when using. I was so excited to get this ruler. It was one of the first pieces to my quilting supplies.
5,love it,first time having a fiskars product im glad with the quality and over all grip of the ruler and the marks crisp and clearwould recommend it
1,Favorite ruler,This is my favorite ruler when cutting fabric for quilts. Along with the June tailor shape cut ruler. This will help to have extra fabric when I need it.
2,Too expensive,I returned it because I found one much cheaper at Walmart. Downside was paying return postage which still resulted in a savings from the original purchase price.
5,The little things,Fiskars got the little details right on this ruler. It has all the measurements I need and is the right thickness to use with my rotary cutter.
5,A collector's must-have series,"Superb camera work, made for high definition. Attenborough's narration is wonderful as always, it will keep your children occupied and delighted for many many hours."
4,Best Gift I Ever Bought,"It was probably the best gift I could ever get for my husband.It was great quality, really interesting and just gorgeous!I was slightly disappointed that some of the footage was duplicated in videos but David Attenborough did a marvelous job and added in more intriguing information that wasnt on other footage"
5,"Planet Earth & Life BBC Series, Awesome!!!","Best visual blu-ray video, great, educational, fascinating!!! Love, love, love it!!! Good gift idea too. Get to know your planet!"
3,it is 1080i and not 1080p !!!,"I just saw it as blu ray and bought it, but after i bought it and played it i felt there was a problem with the resolution, I have seen the 1080p quality in a friend's home, it was so beautiful. Then i looked around the blu ray to see it as 1080i. Very disappointed!! At least they should have mentioned it in the product description..."
3,Blu-ray doesn't automatically mean HD,"I don't know what made me think this Planet Earth blu-ray was going to be in HD even though it probably wasn't filmed in HD, but it's not showing up on my TV screen in HD. I already owned Planet Earth on DVD, so I kinda wasted my money.The documentary itself is great, though, and I'm pretty sure this blu-ray version jas more stuff on it than the DVD version so I don't feel like it warrants anything lower than a 3 even though I now own 2 versions of it."
4,Fan of the Fan Book,"An exhaustive, though sometimes exhausting, textbook on ceiling fans; their history, usefulness, and installation. Geared for the lighting salesperson or contractor that wants to be thoroughly informed. No other book covers the subject as completely or as well. But The Fan Book suffers from one flaw: it was commissioned by the Casablanca Fan Company and shamelessly promotes their products. While this obvious slant can be irritating (unless you're a Casablanca stock holder) the information given on selecting, sizing and installing a ceiling fan can apply to any brand. Aside from the basics, the authors discuss energy efficiency, motor designs, fan controls, and blade construction. The chapter on ceiling fan history could be improved by including the contribution of competitors, such as Hunter -- the company that invented the fan -- which the authors don't even mention."
3,Watch sizing,"Purchase arrived in record time. However, garment was very small for marking. Even though I ordered larger size than recommended, it was very snug and restrictive on dog. Also, keyhole for collar attachment soon began to ravel and had to be reinforced."
4,"Good, but not enough","I think this cd would be better if they only had put the main theme in it's large size, also I would like to tell that this cd contains two repeated songs, the only difference I found was the timing, just a few seconds of difference, also they could just leave the Just as I am large version instead of using the large and tv size version, for the rest the soundtrack is ok.cd list:1. You get to Burning (tv size)2. Christmas in the Galaxy3. Soar, Gekigangar 34. V is for Victory! Gekigangar V5. Just as I Am (large size)6. Just Only you Know7. Deliciou Island8. Aestivalis March9. V is for Victory! Gekigangar V10. I want to Be Your Number One11. Just as I Am (tv size)"
2,OUCH,"Okay, first I want to say that I love Nadesico (almost to the point of obsession), and I totally love the music. Secondly, I want to warn you right now NOT to buy this cd. If like me you were hoping for a cd with the FULL opening and ending songs and all the awesome background music from the series... LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE. This cd contains the WORST music from the series. It does not contain the original versions of most of the great j-pop found in the show (instead featuring some lame alternate remixes).If you truly love the music from this show buy the import cd. It contains the FULL opening and ending, the awesome orchestrated themes, battle music, and the ORIGINAL Gekiganger 3 music. Trust me on this one. This cd is so bad I can't listen to the thing all the way through.Long live Nadesico! Long live Anime! And down with lame music cd releases for awesome anime shows!"
5,An Absolute Joy,"I bought this book on an impulse, and what a wonderful surprise it turned out to be.The book's concept--asking well-known figures to share ""their favorite things"" by jotting them down on their own stationary--reminds us that the things that make our lives special are usually very simple. It's also striking, reading the different lists, to recall how nice a hand-written note can be.The book works on other levels as well. It's great fun, for example, to try and guess what sorts of things the celebrities will list--and more often than not, you'll find yourself surprised by what they say: from Mark McGuire to Robin Williams, from George W. Bush to Regis and Kathie Lee.This book makes a terrific gift as well. Rest assured, if you give this book to someone else, it will spur great conversations about your favorite things--and in so doing, allow you to think about, and appreciate, those things yet again.Kudos as well for supporting the Make-A-Wish foundation."
3,"fun stuff, good cause","Readers will find this a great source of nickle knowledge; celebs from all walks of life responded to the author's request to list some of their favorite things. Many chuckles here, along with some shameless self promotion... and half goes to charity! PS- read the dedication."
4,Good Work-out,"Pros: The instructor, Chaos, didn't jabber on and on like most exercise instructors.Their look was a nice change from the normal-looking ladies in spandex.The work-out is good for BEGINNERS.Cons: Not very challenging. I don't think you could get in really good shape just by doing this a few times a week.The camera work sucked. The cameraman seemed more concerned with zooming up on their ""assets"" rather than staying at a good angle, so you could see what was going on.I recommend the Yoga for Indie Rockers DVD over this one."
2,Amazon Order Freak,"I was excited about getting a workout that looked like it was going to be different from all the rest. Cueing is terrible, proper form is barely discussed, poorly produced and the routine doesn't seem to be well thought out. I have not tried her other dvds, but based on this one I'll be saving my money."
4,DVD Review,"he Least Among You is an inspiring DVD that gives the viewer a glimpse into United States history and the difficult issues surrounding racial prejudice, even amongst those who call themselves Christian. This film is as well made as any movie found in theatres today. In addition to being technically well put together, this film is also clean enough for the whole family to watch. If a parent is desiring to educate a child about the dangers of racial prejudice this film should be considered as a good candidate, though it is great for general watching too!Legal StuffDisclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the [...] book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255 <[...]> : ""Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."""
2,"Should not be labeled ""family approved""","I received the video ""The Least Among You"" free from the publisher at [...]. I was initially excited to receive this video because it was a true story, deemed ""family approved"" and hoped it would be a good history lesson for my children. When I viewed the video I was sorely disappointed on many levels. This, in my opinion, is NOT a family movie. It had violence, drugs and even a very strong curse word, things I do not deem appropriate for a ""family"" movie. Even though the acting was well done, I thought the story line had a hard time of keeping my attention as well. I cannot recommend this movie."
2,Blah,"I can't say I'm a huge fan of Christian movies. This one was just like all the rest - made with the best intentions and the worst equipment/actors. I would recommend buying this movie if you work at a church and need an ""appropriate"" movie to show at a lock-in. Otherwise I wouldn't bother watching it. The acting is bad, the technology is bad, and the storyline is decent. If you love Christian movies check it out, I'm sure that you'll love it if you set your sights low enough. For one reason or another, Christians have yet to make a great movie. This movie is another stepping stone in the process."
4,Great Family Film,"How did I miss a movie starring Louis Gossett Jr., Lauren Holly and William Devane?The Least Among You is a wonderful tale of Richard Kelly, a young UCLA graduate who lands an entry level job at a major corporation in 1965. A wrong place, wrong time situation lands Kelly in jail for assaulting a police officer during the Watts Riots.Despite his innocence, Kelly is sentenced to a seminary where of all things, he is the only Black student. Kelly finds friendship in the least among the seminary, a lowly groundskeeper, played by Louis Gossett, Jr. The movie profiles the ups and downs of Kelly's struggles between life in the seminary and life on the streets of L.A.The Least Among You is a movie loosely based on the true story of Rev. Dr. Charles Marks, a noted professor of Theology. One of our fave features of the DVD was the featurette on Rev. Dr. Marks. This is a quality film worthy of sharing with the family."
2,The Least Among You,"The key themes of this story that can be used as teaching moments are that God has a plan for us, and that we are all equal to him Set in a time of history where Richard Kelly is used to segregation, he has two choices: go to jail or join an all-white seminary. Forgoing jail, his friends turn on him and his new classmates are hesitant to accept him as well. Race is a key theme throughout, but when an unexpected friend comes alongside to help him with his goals, Richard sees the way to success and works hard for his goals.Overall, it was a pretty slow and boring movie and i'm not sure how clear the 'christian' themes came through. I don't think I'd recommend it to others.*Thanks to Booksneeze.com for providing a copy of this DVD for me to review."
3,"Nicely Presented, but Non-Inspiring","Sadly, many Christian movies have the reputation of being less than well produced. However, The Least Among You contains excellent cinematography and quality acting.Caught up in the 1965 Watts Riots, Richard Kelly finds himself on probation in an all-white seminary. Kelly is torn between his civil rights duties, spiritual calling and the presidents agenda for his presence at the all-white school. Inspired by a true story, this movie doesn't shy away from the irony of racial prejudice and hatred within a Christian seminary.Though the overall story was interesting, the plot moves somewhat slowly and ends uninspirationally. However, the movie's thought-provoking contrasts and issues of morality allows for a wholesome way to spend an evening!Booksneeze.com provided me with this DVD for reviewing purposes."
3,The Least Among you,"""The Least Among You"" is a film put out by Lionsgate and tells the story of Richard Kelly. Set in the 1960's after the Watts Riots, Kelly is sentenced to serve out his probation at an all white seminary. Every thing seems on the up and up but the tension begins to surface when a major donor pulls out of a major project. While there is not an awful lot of really good acting in this film it is a good story. Filled with some thought provoking ideas. It does a good job at sharing the scary fact the Christians and non-Christians share the same major character flaw we enter every relationship with assumptions that make it difficult to build trust. Somewhat predictable and unrealistic in its portrayal of 1960's Watts the over arching message of the film is not missed; staying on Gods coarse always ends up well. Easy to watch and the cast does work well together this film is enjoyable."
3,Disappointed,"The story was great, the way it was told not so much. The character development was weak, it felt scattered, and very random at times. However, the deeper meaning and message was powerful. As is any story of struggle and redemption. I will say I was disappointed with the overall production, I felt it could have been so much more engaging for the audience."
3,Excellent Message w/ Strong Acting,"The Least Among You is a good movie about a great story. I was surprised to see some big name actors in the movie considering I have never seen an ad for it on television. The movie is based on a true story and is important in terms of race and religion. The characters are all strong and the acting is excellent in my opinion. I believe the movie lacks a bit in editing as it seems some parts have been cut that relate to the story. However the movie is still good and worth watching.If you enjoy movies that are emotional with personal struggles and race/religion issues, The Least Among You is worth checking out."
1,I was bored and fell asleep!,"Sorry, but I just couldn't connect with this film. I soon fell asleep. There was a lot of dialogue at the beginning and I missed something because I just couldn't get involved in the story."
4,Captivating,"I haven't seen a movie with Lou Gossett Jr that I didn't love, and The Least Among You is no exception. Also starring the wonderful William Devane, Lauren Holly and Cedric Sanders, the cast alone is top-notch.The premise of this movie is that a young enrolls in a seminary to make something of his life, to get out of the ghetto. But what he doesn't realize until he arrives is that he is the first black person to attend. His life is full of obstacles and strife as he and the other people learn to adjust. It's not an easy road, but he and some of the others are better for it.The movie is very well done and kept me captivated and mesmerized as the story played out. Good thing I got my popcorn beforehand! It is family approved, so everyone can watch it, and the message it sends is a strong one. If you get a chance, rent or buy this movie!!"

1,Skip this,Skip this book and skip the movie if you havent already seen it. It's poor un-realistic and booring fiction. Want to know about Hackers? Go read the Fugitive Game.
2,Disclaimer II,"I would have to say that this is not exactly the most accurate, because I thought this was a harder album when I first bought it. I love all types of metal, but this was a little light for me. I only like about song on it, and it is called Pride (Explicit)."
3,overall ok album,"This cd is a re-release of their 'Disclaimer' cd. Although I was impressed with all the extras on the cd itself and also the DVD that's included. There are several flat out amazing songs on this cd, but it's not at all what I anticipated. 'Gasoline' is a power driven track that sets off the cd beautifully. I wasn't impressed though by the second track. Some of the best songs on this cd are one's that would be played on the radio had they released them. Songs like 'Gasoline', 'Needles', 'Pride', 'Sympathetic', 'Fade Away', and 'Hang On' make this cd well worth the price though. I admit I bought this cd after hearing 'Broken' featuring Amy Lee. I loved the way Shaun fed off of Amy's beautiful vocals. This is a solid release despite some slip ups, I do recommend this cd to people who are into rock."
2,So Disapointing,"Well, I was expecting Seether's next album to be a Full LP with 14 brand new tracks. Now All I get is the same CD I purchased 2 years ago with a couple brand new tracks that seems to be older tracks they touched a little.Those old Tracks are supposed to be Remixed / Remastered. Yet, They are all the same as Disclaimer I with a touch to the beat barely noticeable. Poor Work.Of course, for someone who doesn't own Disclaimer, we can find on here the master tracks: Fine Again, Broken and Driven Under. But the new tracks on here are nothing different than a typical track #6 off some rock albums. only Got It Made came to my attention.In conclusion, This is very disapointing. Will we have to wait another 2 years to get BRAND new tracks??? There's nothing on this album than Disclaimer I doesn't have. Period."
2,could have been better,the song broken was a good song but then amy lee had to join thesong and i don't like it as much any more and most of the cd wasok but there are only about 4 songs good on this cdsorry seeter but it could have been way better
5,Great debut cd,THIS ALBUM IS SURE TO PLEASE. THE GUTAR RIFFS ARE SPECTACULAR AND SHAWNS VOICE IS THE RIGHT BLEND OF PAIN AND PLEASURE.
1,Is this the best South Africa can do?,"In response to D. Cresswell, is this it? The best music to come out of your country is a tired nu metal/psudeo grunge act, like countless others out there? Bands like these remind me of hair metal groups like Slaughter and Trixter who where squeezing themselves into the hard rock market at the last minute in the early 90's when Pearl Jam and Nirvana where starting their mark. Like those bands, Seether is an endangered species. In these days of garage rock, neo-prog pop rock and metalcore/thrash metal, most people won't give this band much.So stick to your ""amazing"" SA bands, I'll stick to American, Canadian and European bands who make music that is ORIGINAL."
1,Broken= One of the worst songs of 2004,"Thats right. This song includes every alternative/modern rock radio cliche, including the gravely voices, soft acoustics in the verses, loud powerchords in the chorus and lyrics about feeling ""PAIN"" and being ""BROKEN"". lmao. The song is so horribly boring and overplayed- its like one of those songs where when it comes on the radio you just immediately change it and say [...]"
1,WTF?!?!?!?!?!,"I hate when bands do this. I bought Disclaimer shortly after it came out a couple of years back, and found Seether to be one of the best new rock bands I had heard in a long time. Now, instead of putting together a brand new album, we get a rehashed version with bonus tracks that the purchasers of the original release need to shell out another sixteen bucks to hear. Note to record companies: this is why people download mp3s. If a band is going to do this, there should be a way for the owners of the original album to get the extra tracks from the band's website or something. This is simply a marketing ploy to get people to buy an album twice."
4,Good Start for Seether,"Seether's first album is their weakest album to date because of one thing: the F bomb. There is one track on here that throws the F bomb around about 18 times, and it even incorporates the F word in its title. Therefore, it is their weakest song in their discography. But, nonetheless, I liked this album. It is just as well-written as anything else this band has done.Rating: 4 stars/5 stars"
4,You won't be disappointed!,"I have always liked listening to seether when they come on the music channels, so my girlfriend picked me up this album. I now have all their albums! This is a great band and the album doesn't leave you disappointed. I think the fact you can keep listening to the album over and over again shows that you don't get bored of the tracks. Take me away and Broken are two of my favourite songs ever. I will say the album does have one or two weak tracks that I now skip when listening too, but the pro's really out weight the con's. The majority of the album is amazing tracks. I don't think you would be disappointed if your downloaded it."
5,seether disclaimer 2,this cd is by far one of the best metal albums ever. i first purchased it at walmart but they neglected to tell me that they sold only censered metal cd's. thanks to amazon.com for providing the correct item. great service great selection great everything.
5,DISCLAIMER II,"wow its already been 2 years and they release another disclaimer it reminds me of linkin park when they did reanimation. i just hope seether doesnt take to long to release there sophomore album. ive been a fan of seether ever since i saw them at ozzfest 2002 and they were really great. when i bought the cd i was expecting the songs to be alot different and they were by just a little bit. they sound 10x better remastered then the original and that is why i gave this cd 5 stars. another reason i gave it 5 stars is the 8 ""new"" tracks on the cd and the fact that they put hang on on here which by the way is my favorite song by them. im guessing there sophomore album will come out near the end of august to match the date of there debut but who knows i just hope its sometime soon."
2,The problem with...,"Bands like this is that they try too hard. Simple. They parody each other and try to be goth sensitive while being dark. Its all al farce, and its also embarrassing to think at guys portraying himself as such a tortured soul with fisting the air with make up on his face. Later in life this music scene will be panned as cliche' and it was. This CD is just a record companies attempt to suck money out of your pocket pretending to be genuine."
4,Even better than the original,"Whether the idea of rereleasing albums and asking your fans to repurchase an album is smart is debatable, but as a standalone album, Seether's Disclaimer II is good - really good.Disclaimer II has just the right balance of heavy rockers with lighter fare with very little fill. The new tracks are all worthy of inclusion, although new fans hooked by the included version of ""Broken"" with Amy Lee are going to be a little shell-shocked.Seether is just a solid rock band. They have strong, heavy songs with catchy choruses and melodies throughout.Sure, lead singer Sean doing his Kurt Cobain impersonation can get a little old, but it doesn't take too much away from the music.For casual fans who didn't get Disclaimer, Disclaimer II is smart purchase. For fans who felt they were being ripped off, the extra tracks and the DVD (with a rather well-done live show plus the band's videos) make the disc worth the price."
2,"Beautiful book, lopsided view though","This will look great on your coffee table but dont expect to see a complete treatment of the subject. Too much coverage on ""traditional"" buildings such as Disney offices and resort hotels. Not enough coverage of the attractions and the parks themselves. Rather than cover the facinating topic of Disney architecture and the role it plays in guests experiences, the author dwells on their favorite architects."
4,Wonderful Work - Short CD,"While I understand it is merely a ""hello, we're Humanwine and this is our EP"", it left me salivating at the thought of more tracks. This frustrated me quite a bit and is probably the only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars. That and I was constantly reminded of the Squirrel Nut Zippers, even though this band provides a much more modern/deco approach to their music.The vocal style provides a wonderful combination of a 20s/30s kickback while incorporating a modern sound and emotional expression. The base composition of the songs provides the same, but with much more of a ""punch"" than expected.If you want to diversify your music mix and enjoy listening to new, unique combinations of genres as well as a genuinely unique sound, this is a must have. However, for a casual/pop listener, I would not recommend it."
1,"Hot Guys in thongs, but not much Hot Yoga","I tried this video on Netflix thinking that I could get a little hot yoga routine in my very own apartment, rather than paying to go to the local studio. What a mistake!Yes, the three guys in the video are nice looking and are wearing tiny (I mean micro small!) white thong swimsuits, but the yoga is also barely there. The monotonous music and dull voice over is a snore fest.Might be fun to play in the background with the sound off at a bachelorette party, but for yoga instruction, not a good option."
5,A wonderful book for all children.,"This beautiful, rythmic book is perfect for a child of any age. My son fell in love with it when he was only 4 months old. He still reads it daily. This book is a treasure!"
4,one change I would make,"This book is pretty good, but if you practice Unconditional Parenting there is one revision I made to the text. On the pages that said ""baby happy, baby sad, baby good, baby bad"" I changed it to ""baby happy, baby sad, baby looking, baby glad.If you don't know what's wrong with calling a baby who is sitting still ""good"" and a curious, exploring baby ""bad"", please read Unconditional Parenting. thanks!"
5,my 2 month old loves this book,"This book thrills my two month old. We go from cover to cover over and over again before he tires of looking at the pictures. He clearly enjoys it more than any other board book we have shown him. I also like the multi-cultural aspect of the book and the variety of expressions on the babies' faces. As the coordinator for a home visiting program for families with new babies, I am ordering copies to give as a gift to our parents."
4,Good beginner book for babies 4 months and younger,My 2 month old daughter liked looking at the black and white photos of the babies. Young babies top two things to look at are black and white pictures/patterns and pictures of faces. This book has put the two together. Recommended to buy for those who are pregnant or have a young child.
2,Not the best picture book of babies,"I purchased this book because my 10 month old likes books featuring pictures of babies. However, this one fails to keep her attention. She likes, ""Baby Faces,"" by Dorling Kindersley Publishing much better.The cover of this book looked appealing (you do not get to preview an excerpt with this book). I found that the pictures do not match the text as well as in other books. The baby in, ""baby good,"" is not engaged in any activity and looks bored and a little sad. The baby in, ""baby bad,"" has apparently discovered a bag of flour and has a wonderful smile. If I were a baby, I know which I'd rather be. The baby in, ""baby laugh,"" looks scary.The mirror at the end of the book is distorted, so even that ""picture"" does not seem right. I am removing this book from her collection."
5,Wow! What a Bible study tool!,"My associate pastor first showed me his copy of this great reference tool for the Bible. I knew right away that I had to have one. Now, when reading the Bible or studying a particular subject, I keep it handy. It unfolds to a humongous chart of biblical timelines layed over against world history timelines. It amazes me how much information is packed into this great, graphical study tool.Over the years, I have kept various helpful lists (prophets of Israel, kings of Israel, geneologies of the biblical patriarchs, the Jewish feasts, etc.) ... I never dreamed that this kind of tool was available. Hats off to its author and producer."
5,Great product!,"Love the chart layouts; it's one thing to hear how long people lived, it's another to see the length of lives and how many generations they spanned. There is a lot of information in a small area. I do however wish the artist wouldn't have added the animal names to the ark areas; I doubt the credibility of the labels which, if viewed by another, could cast doubt on the credibility of the book overall."
5,Excellent resource,Excellent resource! A must have to go along with studies. Wonderful way to provide a visual for kids and adults.
4,Great rainy day book and biblical study aid,"Those of you who are fans of any kind of timeline historical charts will enjoy this large-format (a bit bigger than 12 x 17) foldout slick cardboard timeline. 9 of the panels lead horizontally from (yup, you guessed it) Adam & Eve to Nero, circ. 90 AD. Arranged vertically on each panel are continuing color-coded tracks of dynasties and biblical family lineages. A must if you are doing the cover-to-cover thing of the Bible and are struggling thru the drier parts. Other panels provide the usual bible-era maps. Reverse of the timeline provides lists of battles, prophets, etc. too numerous to mention. I love this book myself, but it would be great for any 8-11 year-old with nothing to do on a rainy day."
4,Artistic and Informative,"The time-chart is an impressive collection of works by different illustrators and seems to have been coordinated by a single author. The date coordination appears to match the instances in the bible and fills in other areas where the bible is silent with informed estimates of the approximate date(s).Some of the text within the timeline contains grammatical errors which can be distracting. Also, some of the text runs through the folds within the chart resulting in cut-offs and duplication of letters due to the off-set text.Other than those snippets, the publication is both creative and very helpful when trying to understand the series of events in both a biblical sense and other events happening at the same time throughout the world. Recommend purchasing for anyone interested in history, summary of key events described in the bible, or just a general curiosity of Christian beliefs"
3,It Fills In the Blanks,"For a person wanting to understand the continuous nature of the Bible, and to see how the events of the world unfolded and intersected the biblical events, this is an excellent source. The illustrated timelines and the incapsulated history lessons help bring the Bible to life. The book is one continuous page (front and back) and you will find yourself unfolding it on the kitchen table and studying it beyond the immediate question that caused you to open it."
4,Kick Butt!,"I especially liked the story with Bat-Mite! HE is so cute and funny. ""Hothouse"" is a little confusing though, but I think I pretty mush got it down."
4,a must-own lp,"like i said before, this is a must-own. granted, not all the songs are worth listening to, but the gems that are found here are just that - gems. 'ripped up suit' is an awesome song, and according to reviews, co-written by kathleen hanna. the first three songs will remind you of melodies that have hints of eighties pop and the velvet underground. 'she never understood' is the toe-tapper song that should be on all movie soundtracks involving movies that has love as a base theme.try this album out. and like i said before, there are songs you will care not to listen too, but there are those that you will never forget - i promise."
4,Mary Emmerling's American Country Details,It was a great inspiring book for the person who just love country living. This book is good for anyone who would like to bring a little country home with them. If you love country then this book is for you some great ideas through out the whole book.
2,"Poorly organized, hard to find information you need","Bought this book to get started with Python for work purposes. However, I have yet to use it for anything useful. 4 other people agreed, that the organization of book is poor, things I needed to use such as dictionaries and variables were short and scattered information. Also some information he gave in the examples did explain important notes , like you need to import x module in order for this to work, etc.In summary, don't think it makes a good beginner book as title implied."
2,Tedious,"I bought this book based on the uniformly excellent reviews that it has received, and I am disappointed.My view is that the book is two to three times thicker than it needs to be, I think because the intended audience is too broad. If you already know that a string is a sequence of characters, then probably this book is going to bore and frustrate you.I'm still looking for a decent introduction to Python, but this isn't it."
5,beginning python,"i've never reviewed a book before but after studying python with this book, i had to.simply amazing.very witty and doesn't skip any steps.if you are wondering about something, there is a little footnote explaining.its like the author is right there listening to your thoughts.a smart guy.i recommend this book above ALL other python boks."
2,Not to be fooled by the 5-star rating.,"I bought this book solely because it is being rated as a 5 stars. But after giving the book a glance, I am very dissapointed. It is cerntainly NOT a book for a novice. And I really doubt it could be good for a seasoned guy. First, I think the book does BAD job in the content. It does NOT spend much in describing the basic knowledge of Python rogramming, like the type, structures, controls, etc. Second, I don't like the writing style. It is more subjective but less objective. Comparing to the famous Perl ""camel"" book, I have to regretly rate this python book as a 1~2 stars. Getting some other python books is surely what I will do next."
5,"Clear, Complete, and Well Written","I have been programming for over 30 years. (Remember FORTRAN?) I recently needed to learn Python for my job. I found this book an excellant introduction to the language. As a bonus it goes well beyond the introductory level. It obviously helps to have a background in object oriented design and programming, but it is not absolutely required. For someone that needs to learn Python or that is just curious, this is a great place to start."
4,"Easy to understand, well written",I read another Python for beginners book and it did not really do the trick. I am on chapter 3 and I am already writing scripts that are very helpful in my job as a mass storage administrator.Highly recommend.
1,Still don't get it,"I'm the novice the title refers to. Not an absolute beginner as I've had some training in Visual Basic, so I get some of the concepts. But this book has me totally confused. The examples are not always well explained. I spent four nights trying to decipher one bit of code early on in the book. It shouldn't be that hard. A friend recommended the book to me saying, it's not great, but it's the best there is out there about Python. Humph."
2,Not clear and well structured,"The secrets to a good technical book, especially one that is comprehensive is organization and clarity. I found this book to be lacking in those regards. The material needs to be organized better, motivated better and the book as a whole could be more accessible. Note that if you was DIS-organized Python material there is a ton of information on the web. For Python in particular, the secret to a good book is not listing all the hodge-podge of neat modules, but providing a coherent and sensible story for how all they stuff fits together. I think other books do that better."
5,"Clear, Witty, Engaging, Thorough...Best Amazon Purchase EVER!","Reading this book was zen-like. I've never picked up a programming book where the explanations were so incredibly clear. Magnus Hetland moves quickly through the core language while leaving no stone unturned for the adventurous (with an ""if you don't care about x, skip ahead"" qualifier). Beautiful, elegant examples have been thoughtfully selected to address the questions and curiosities a reader might have. Magnus' knowledge of Python's built-in libraries and the tools being built by the Python community is extraordinary...it's difficult not to be convinced after reading this book that Python is the greatest thing since sliced bread.And if that weren't enought to justify a 5-star rating, the author promptly replied to a question I sent via email with a witty and helpful response. I've bought copies of the book for friends and family and recommend it heartily for anyone thinking about learning Python."
2,Messy squared = BPITB,"Brilliant author, interesting structure of the book with some small projects in the end to get you started beyond the grammar of the language to its application for solving real life problems... so did I like this book? No! Unfortunately this book won't make you like Python, and this is why: let's face it, Python, with all its good sides, it's a messy scripting language, and unfortunately messy programmers and authors tend to to be attracted to messy tools. With ""messy"" I don't intend something strictly negative, but something that , beyond confusion,disorganization and lack of a clear plan and structure also shows originality, agility and some quirkiness. Now, while a ""messy"" author describing a ""serious"" language, or a ""serious"" author explaining a ""messy"" language are both interesting combinations, a ""messy"" author trying to introduce you to a ""messy"" language"" results only in a big pain in the butt. And that is what this book amounts to."
3,Didn't receive this order,"Hello,I made this order at April 25th but I didn't receive this order yet.Please ship it again or find out where it is because this iem did not reach to our office at all.Thanks,Noa"
2,"One good, one bad","I ordered two. Both worked well out of the box. Came pre-charged. Gives an adequate but not brilliant light. Good for working under a car.Of the two, one lost most of the pixels the day after I lit it the first time. I keep my fingers crossed that the other one stays good."
4,Nice light,This is a nice LED worklight. It's case is rugged and screwed together so it's serviceable. The hooks could be stronger but I usually have to improvise on those anyway.A bigger battery pack would make this even better (there's enough room in the handle) but it'll do.
1,Chinese junk,Nothing else to say. Sent me used crap strewn about in a box. Never worked form the jump. Beware of this guy.
3,Too much talking,"The music is great, as is everything I've listened to by Aeoliah. But I wish I had realized it was a ""guided"" meditation CD. The constant interruptions proved very distracting for me. I realize many like that kind of thing, and to them I'd say get this album. But for those who want just meditative ambient music, check out some of the other albums by Aeoliah, such asAngel LoveorDolphin Serenade."
1,"Same as ""clingwrap"" material","The material is basically the same as plastic sheeting material found at your local home builder store. The only different is the price and the appearance (clear vs translucent).It is simply too thin for my application. I did not feel it can handle the wind or foreign subject. No thickness was mentioned in the description. The illustration mislead me thinking the material is much thicker than actual. It is almost the same as your ""clingwrap"" material.I hope I can get my money back."
4,Gets rid of alot of pent up aggression,I came in from school and I was really angry. I figured I would unwind by playing videogames.My father picked up this game for me and I had yet to play it so I put it in the ps2 and was amazed. I played it for three hours and love it. The violence in the game is a great outlet and the deaths and combinations are loads of laughs.I am not crazy or demented at all. Ask any player and they will tell you that the final words of the victims you kill are hilarious.In this game you can combined your traps with stuff in the room. Like use a pushwall to knock someone into a wall of revolving spikes.This game is extremely violent but as long as you don't take it seriously it is loads of fun and can relieve alot of pent up aggression.
3,Deception 4,"Fun for people who played the Tecmo's Deception series. Not as much variety in this one, but the graphics are decent and it's still fun using the traps. The Dark Illusions are pretty nice for the most part."
3,Good Game,"Well i really only found two things i really didn't like for one the story is kinda set in stone, as in you are only in control of allura when your fighting other wise your just watching the movie. The other thing i didn't really like was the fact that theres alot of load screens most are uneeded. I also didn't like that it was in japanese yes it gave the game a better affect but i have a problem reading and watching the movie i'm not quick enough. Its not a big deal but yeah. Otherwise i loved the game. The game is deffinatly a game for people who love RPG's and are willing to stick with it. You get to set up your traps and can buy more as you go. I instantly fell in love with most of the characters."
4,Very cute story!!!,"Although this is not what I've come to expect from SL, I still really enjoyed this story. I loved seeing Max's life turned topsy-turvy & the antics of the 3 younger sisters was just too fun! I'll have to admit that with this many characters involved character development wasn't that great, but I also didn't have to go through the long process of not liking the characters before they started growing into decent human beings; so, all in all, that worked out okay for me. I liked the fact that Max & Caroline tried to keep focused on taking care of the younger ones. Although this was not an action packed story, I did not find it boring like other reviewers. The girls keeping Max on his toes was fun & entertaining to me. I would recommend it to those that like a light, fun, & very sweet story."
2,Boo,"Our hero is a user who discards women without a thought. Now, regencies often feature rakes and rogues, but to my mind, there's a big difference between the man who keeps a mistress (who knows the game and plays it) and a man who seduces marriageable young women with no intention of marriage. This man puts the future of those women into very real jeopardy without considering the consequences for anyone but himself. A ruined woman had few options at this time, and preying on the innocent is hardly a charming trait, especially when he could instead have a liaison with a widow or keep a mistress. In other words, our ""hero"" is a total bastard. Call me crazy, but the attitude that ""all other women besides you are disposable"" doesn't make my heart go pitter pat. Oh, so she's special? For how long? Then there are his friends, who try to seduce the other women in the family. Guess what? They're bastards too. Romance fail."
2,"Boring, Bland and Blah","This book was another Lauren's book that I just couldn't get into. I would read a few pages and put it down. It was definately NOT a page turner. I couldn't get into the story which was so bland and boring and spread out among so many characters. There was no action at all, no heart wrenching moments, although there could have been. Laurens constantly ""overwrites"" the story by explaining and explaining on stupid sub plots you could care less about. Caroline, the heroine of the story (I think), was not even fully developed as a character. It seems all she does is smile. That's all I can remember about her character, and I just read a few pages more last night. I am just about finished and almost don't want to. Oh, where is a Julia Quinn or a Kat Martin when you need it?!"
3,Okay but....,"While I found parts of this book very entertaining, I found it fell short of what I am accustomed to from this author. I read in one of the earlier reveiws that this was one of her earlier works and that makes me feel better. My main gripe with this book is that Ms.Laurens brought in so many secondary characters that I found it difficult to get into Caroline and Max's story. When they finally do get together, the reader is left wondering how it happened because you are literally thrown 10 or 12 other people that have sub plots. Not only do you read about Caro and Max but also her four sisters (on a somewhat individual basis), their potential beau's, two other girls that the four befriend, an aunt, and a slew of gentleman bevying to win the hand of one of the four girls hands. Its a book you should probably borrow from someone. Don't buy it."
3,"A Different Type of Plot, but Insipid Characters","Five romances all rolled into one is the way to describe this book. However, it just comes off a bit confusing, even if the storyline is cute in general.Four in Hand is the tale of Max Rotherbridge and Caroline Twynning, Guardian and Ward respectively. The other romances are made up of Max's younger brother and his friends (all of whom are rakes) and Caroline's sisters. As usual, I developed an extreme dislike for all of the rakes, including Max, and wished they would all die of typhoid or something equally horrendous. I also learned to loathe most of the females, as being incredibly stupid and just plain lucky that they were born pretty, because they certainly were cheated by God on brains.I give the book 3 stars anyway for a new look at an old plot. It is worth buying."
1,Not a Romp,"According to Ms. Laurens, this is a Regency romp. I would call it more of a Regency plod. It is not only boring in the exteme, as nothing really happens. It is unlikely that four ""beautiful and charming"" young ladies would all fall for rather worthless men. I couldn't really read it, just skimmed the surface of the last half to see if it got better. It didn't."
1,Boring,"I got this book a the supermarket cause I did not have anything to read for the weekend. Wished I had left it there. I thought it would be like Stephanie's other books. Unfortunately not. Like the other review - way too many characters, not sure if there was a hero/heroine really couldn't figure that out. It took me a lot longer than a weekend to finish it. Did not keep me spellbound and I hate to give this a 1 star, but it was truly not a good story. Next time an idea like this pops up - write 4 different stories for each hero/heroine in 1 book. I will still read other books by Stephanie, but will definitely watch for reviews though."
2,Four too many,"I am huge Stephanie Lauren's fan, which is why I am extremely disappointed with this book. I can't say that I read it; I just kind of skimmed through it. The plot was thin at best and that is because she just had too much going on in the book. The story is supposed to be about Caroline and Max, but their story gets lost in the madness. In most books written by her, you get used to the dominant male knowing from the beginning that he wants the heroine, but usually the lady takes longer to decide if the male is right for her. In this book she gives new meaning to ""love at first sight"" because literally that is what drew the couples together. They just look at each other and fall in love. The story should be about Amanda because her story kind of takes center stage and the other girls become subplots. I prefer to stick with her Cynster and Bastion Club novels."
5,An Instant Favorite!!!,"I absolutely adore the Cynster series, but I was unsure about how well Ms Laurens could create a novel that could stand alone. I could not have been more pleased. I loved that there were so many characters and so much passion going around. I always like to read about a good rake being brought low, but four in one book!! It was heaven. The girls were delightfully cheeky,and the men they chose were perfect for each of them. It was really refreshing to read a romance novel based on just that- romance. There are no murderers or treasures or evil relations, just four irrepressable young women. Anyone who loves an EXTREMELY happy ending (or endings!) would really enjoy this story."
2,Old Data on Map,"Nicely crafted map however the listing cites a copyright of 2004 but the (new) map I received was actually copyrighted 2002. Unfortunately, this is too outdated for a dynamic city like New York. For example, it still has the Coliseum at Columbus Circle (which has been long gone) instead of the Time-Warner Center. For me, this is most disappointing. Friends, my recommendation when buying maps is always check the copyrighted date. You want something reasonably current."
4,Great map,I especially liked this map being printed on a non rip type mylar instead of paper. The detail is also teriffic.
1,"Loom & Doom, Don't Buy This DVD","Don't waste your money on this DVD. All the characters get killed off one by one by a sniper. I reviewed the first episode ""When Paradise is Lost"" with more detail. In the first episode, half the main characters gets killed off. In this episode, the rest get shot. There isn't any pleasant ending to this video. The only victor is the sniper which you hardly see or no nothing about. This DVD went from my DVD player to the trash can."
4,recommendable book,"This is a very interestig and readable book, therefore Irecommend it not only for the gay people but also the bisexual or heterosexual inclined people , including young students. However, I was astounded at the scantiness or absences of the classical Greek & Latin, Sanskrit literature, Arabian et Persian poetries, archaic Chinese and Japanese texts."
2,Just So-So,"I didn't want to run all over town to buy 3 new large cookies sheets...needed them for holiday baking and was tired of my old warped ones. These are very heavy. The cookie targets are just plain dumb. I have made thousands of cookies in my day and the performance is just so-so. They seemed to brown the cookies to much, so I had to adjust the baking time on all the recipes I used. If you buy them, make sure they will fit in your oven...they fit in mine but since I was less than thrilled with them, I tried to give one to my sister...but didn't fit in her oven. I wish I had just gone shopping and taken a good look at what was available instead of ordering based on reviews and the Pyrex name. The good news is that Amazon sent the order right away and the order came just as expected."
5,Gondola car,"Car was great, price was even better, ho train Gondola. Makes my train look very good, and carries heavy loads."
1,Dollshouse Magazine Subscriptions,This is a lovely magazine...if the publisher/Amazon/whoever would actually send it. Expect to pay your money and then wait... And then expect to be shuffled between Amazon and Magazine Express...forever. Then just go to the newstand and buy the magazine.
3,"not bad , could be better","not a bad looking helmet , I aged mine using cold blue , and then letting it rust up a bit before oiling and polishing off the worst of the rust ! otherwise , it is a bit undersized in circumforance ! it will fit if you have a small to medium hat size ! cant imagine wearing mail or padding under it , just to small !"
3,Just thought i'd try this,"This CD is OK but it is not realy my kind of music, I think I have played it once and have never picked it up again"
3,an interesting comcept-an alright album,"I had heard several cuts off of this album on accuradio's americana station, including the heavy take on oh death by Diane Izzo and Gary Gilmour's Eyes, so I was excited when I found it at Hastings. Unfortunately, this turns out to be a very uneven album with some of the songs being very entertaining, and some just sounding like filler. This could be partially because almost everyone is a guest, but I think that it has more to do with just trying to find a bunch of people to do this album. It seems like this album could have been made with less songs and it would have been a better album."
3,"Nice features, but not clear","I just bought this phone yesterday. I love the features it offers and it is very easy to program, etc. The problem I have with it is that it has some static/background noise and a definate clicking sound that is irritating while your trying to have a conversation. I was hoping that this would be a good phone, but I'm planning to take it back today and try something else."
2,Not very good,"I purchased this phone because the price was low and it had the features I was looking for, Caller ID, Call waiting Caller ID and a message waiting indicator for voice mail service from the local phone co. These features work well but the sound quality is not that good. The speaker where you put your ear has only a very small slit opening that makes it hard to hear a caller unless you move the phone to just the right position on your ear. Even with the volume turned all the way up it is annoying to use. AT&T phones used to be some of the best cordless phones on the market but they are now made by a subsidary of VTech called Advanced American Telephones. I would not purchase this phone again and would be cautious about a phone from Advanced American Telephones or Vtech."
1,Did not fit onto rotor shaft,"I installed this onto my 2000 Altima but it took a lot of force to get it to line up the setting screw hole. I broke off a flange of plastic trying to get this part into place. Then I couldn't get it off. Will have to go to a shop for that. As for the setting screw, I stripped it with minimal effort and had to use the old one from the previous rotor."
1,"Ignition rotor, 1999 Nissan Altima","Purchaseed this along with the Distributor cap. Cap fit fine and appears to be a quality product. The rotor button however would not slip over the shaft to install. It was an exact match of the original part, however the inner diameter of the rotor was not large enough and would not slide easily over the shaft.... in fact, it would not fit even forcing it."
4,High quality part...,Fit my '99 Altima exactly. Bosh packages everything well and includes high quality screws (hex/philips) that won't strip out easily.
1,Does not fit Accord LX ULEV 2.3L (Engine F23A4),"It's not Amazon's fault. Before I made the purchase I verified [...] for the correct P/N's and this (04313) is the one they state will fit a 99 Accord 2.3L LX ULEV, it doesn't!The shaft in the ULEV is smaller in terms of diameter so it wiggles and also this rotor's depth is more than the one installed, so the screw doesn't get anywhere near the threads."
3,It was okay. . .,"I'd have to check out other reading journals before I'd buy another of these. Five pages are allotted for reflection of the book; three of those pages have pre-printed guide questions (about characters, the ending, and your prediction of the book's staying power) at the top of the page, which I felt a strange obligation to stick to. I felt weird leaving blank space, though I did with many entries. There were a few books that I clipped in extra pages so I could keep digesting the book on paper.Perhaps a blank journal would suit me better, but I do like having those guide questions; I sometimes need that little kick to get me to really think about what I've just read."
2,Incomplete,"When I received the pen the cartridge was dry and the spare cartridge was missing. Therefore, I had to add $17.00 to the price to make it work. I won't be doing this again. Bought it for a present and didn't have time to return it so I was stuck paying the extra money I shouldn't have had to pay. Yes, I am upset."
5,Waterman Rollerball Pen: A Great Choice,This pen is absolutely great and the price was great. The rollerball is even better than the Waterman ballpoint pen it replaced. It is very well made and it writes very well. I am more than satisfied with this purchase.
5,Blinky Light,"So far, I am really liking this light. It is easy to install on my helmet, swivels the way the description states, and after 350 miles, I am still using the same batteries that came with the light. I only use it blinking mode and I think that saves battery life. The only small drawback is that I think the light itself should be a bit brighter. Other than that, I really do like this product!"
5,Be Seen - Be Safe - This Light will do That,"This is a very nice product. It mounted on my bike helmet without a problem. I end up riding at dusk or at dark many days. I use this helmet light and a blinking light on my seat post. Motorists always see me. I suggest a luminous vest and lights(front & back) if you ever ride after dark or at dusk. It's cheap insurance. By the way - if you ride a bike, wear a helmet."
4,"Light is good, mounting not so good","The light seems to be just fine. However, I had a very difficult time mounting this on my helmet. I didn't have center point on my helmet like it pictures, so I kind of had to straddle and opening. Seems like it will work, but with the amount of time it took to get just right, I'm not going to take it off. Contemplating just gluing it to the helmet."
5,Great Idea!,"This is a great product. It easily mounted to my helmet which is not your typical style so I was very happy about that. It's bright and it's in a perfect spot. Combined with a back light on my bike, I am much more visible at night which is SO important for the city. The light has two settings, steady and flashing. Get this product!"
3,Helps Drivers See You,"Bought this light to go along with a Radbot, Planet Bike SuperFlash and other Planet bike tail light. My girl friend commutes daily in Chicago and this light helps drivers see her. It's not as bright as The Radbot or Superflash but since it sits on the helmet it's a little better for SUV and Trucks that might not see standard tail lights. The mount seems decent and stable plus, it swivels so that the light is always visible with head movements."
1,blah,"This blink bicycle light is annoying. there is no need for this light to ""swivel"". the light is visible but the swivel is not practical"
2,Not for my helmet,"This one didn't mount on my helmet. Despite the fact that it swivels, there was nowhere to mount it in the back and I already have a MiNewt USB and its battery on the top."
5,"Got lots of attention, which is perfect.","Bikers and car drivers would lean out and say they liked my helmet light, and I was using it in Manhattan, a place with enough distractions -- so now that mine finally broke I've been searching to make sure I get the same again, cause it just plain works well."
3,neat idea,"Bright little light. I like the idea of the high-mounted light for better visibility, but the helmet mount doesn't fit my helmet very well. I'm a little worried about the durability of the mounting bracket, but it's holding up ok so far. We use this in addition to a regular light mounted on the seatpost for better visibility in intersections where you might be turning your head to look for cross-traffic. Two other things that keep me from giving it a higher rating, the self-leveling doesn't keep it perpendicular to the road, it points down slightly, making it harder to see from a distance and the power button on the back is very easy activate accidentally."
4,"You look like a bobble head, but it works.","This light attaches to a helmet very easily and is visible at a good distance. I used zip ties to secure it. Good price, good product."
4,Versatile and visible,This tail light is a great addition to your rear lighting when biking. It easily attached to the helmet and is much higher and more visible then a typical rear light.
2,Start malfunctioning after 6 months,"After 6 months of use, our rear blinky starts malfunctioning and will turn on by itself, and it will do that a couple times a night (probably does that during the day too but we notice this mostly at night). It's absolutely bizarre. Now, one thing for sure is that the battery will get drained pretty quickly unless we can find a way to 'fix' it."
5,Yesss!!,Great album for everyone who is into hip hop with depth. Krush's production technique's turn out flawlessly!(The Aesop Rock track is crazzzyyyyinsane)Awesome album!A Must Buy
2,Wish they didn't fold,These seem gimmicky to me. They're more expensive and less durable than what I replaced them with... a small wooden spatula. I love MSR's gear... just not this particular piece.
3,OK,These are OK but not great. They are light and easy to pack due to the hinge. They also are a bit flimsey due to the hinge would probably just buy aluminum reagular stuff next time.
4,Fascinating,My husband is a rock polisher and very interested in rocks and gems. He sits and reads this book for long periods of time. Lots of information and pictures.
1,Peg Hooks,This is a low quality product provided by a totally unethical person. My advice is to avoid this seller.
3,okay,"I bought this to replace an old T-Fal griddle I had since the 80's, which I loved. I am replacing a lot of my coookware because we just bought a place with an electric stove (coil-type). I have anodized aluminum and it just doesn't work well on this overly hot stove. I have better luck with cast iron and tri-ply, but I don't like making eggs, pancakes, french toast on cast iron. In short, I think this would work well on gas and glasstop electric with the bridge burners. It's not horrible, but there is a very noticible cooking time difference between the areas that contact the burner and the area between. Almost takes twice the time to cook in the middle area. I have two batches of pancakes from the burner areas done by the time the first batch from the center is done. I didn't have this problem on the gas stove. But my old T-Fal griddle is also thicker. You just have to keep more of an eye on it than I'm used to. If you don't mind this, it is a decent value."
5,wonder cream for baby!,My newborn had dry skin on the sides of his face and I used this cream (already love the shampoo!) and it cleared up in the first week of use. I still use it now and then to extra soften his face. Great product!
3,Assessment of Yoga for Beginners,"I gave this review 3 stars because this DVD has a major positive and a major negative. First, the positive: The teacher, her delivery, and her technique are really, really good - easy to follow and well explained. The negative is that the DVD contains upfront advertising that you must watch (I can't even fast forward through it) every time you want to follow the DVD. It irritates me so much that I mostly use the pamphlet that accompanied the DVD."
2,leaves much to be desired,"My boyfriend got me two dvd's, this one to learn off of, and another slightly fast paced one for when i got the hang of yoga. This dvd is..hokey, slow and annoying. Off the bat your stuck watching minutes of advertisements that you can't skip through, The set up its self is low budget, its a woman in a white leotard who talks so monotone she must be Mr. Roger's daughter, I can never get through much of the DVD because of how boring it is, I do appreciate the simple house hold props, as i hate work out dvd's that require all sorts of special equipment (weights, resistance bands, balls, etc etc etc) I don't have the room for all that junk. anyway, Don't waste your time you're better off watching some beginners yoga on youtube. Cheaper and likely to be 100 times more interesting."
1,By Far My Worst Yoga DVD,I was looking for a beginner's workout in Yoga. All I got was Patricia Walden demonstrating Yoga poses at a snail pace. Definitely a waste of time and money!Overall rating: 1.0
3,"Good for total novices, the ""workout"" is not one.","I bought this DVD assuming that the pose instruction was too ""beginner"" for me but looking forward to the ""bonus"" beginners workout. I have the Rodney Yee Power Yoga for beginners and it's challenging, I wanted a second DVD that was easier. I was frustrated to find that the workout is really just a series of pose instructions. Thus I would recommend this DVD for the true novice, but I penalized its rating for claiming to have a ""beginners workout"" when it really doesn't. I didn't get what I thought I was getting."
2,does she know the definition of beginner?,I would NOT recommend this for begginers. She rushes through the content and haves you trying to do streches experienced students would have difficulty with. Find a different one.
2,Just not that good,"My husband and I tried this video after reading and hearing so many good things about it. We returned it shortly after, not because it was awful or she was annoying, but because it just ""didn't do it"" for us.We started yoga a couple years ago when I was pregnant and loved the Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea. Her workouts are beautifully filmed, easily adaptable, and most importantly for us they have FLOW!The Shiva Rea video, which we later bought in dvd, has been our only real experience with yoga, aside from a couple trial classes when we lived near a city and some casual work-outs with friends. Maybe that is why we were disappointed with Patricia's program.This disc explains a few poses (and she is painfully thourough) but there is no real progression or flow to speak of. We also felt the quality was lacking, at least in relation to the other Giam ones we've seen.So here we are, back to Pre-natal, even though our daughter is a year and a half (and digging Itsy-Bitsy Yoga herself!)"
4,Yoga Journal's Yoga for Beginners DVD ~ Patricia Walden,"This DVD is just what I needed. As a beginner, I wanted something to help me learn how to do Yoga correctly, so that I could get the most out of it.Patricia Walden does a very good job of explaining the proper way of doing several standing poses as well as a few mat poses.The included workout does a good job of putting the poses together. I believe that was the intent of this DVD."
3,Best for extreme beginners,I bought this so I could do yoga at home. I've been to a few yoga classes but am no expert therefore I thought this video would work well. Unfortunately this video is geared towards someone with no experience at all. It's a little to slow and instructiony for me.
1,Horrible DVD - Very low budget,"I own the Crunch Fat Burning Yoga DVD and thought I'd try a new DVD since I wanted to switch things up a bit. I bought this DVD and it was horrible. The background is a horrible blue and it was as if the DVD was created on a low budget back in the early 90s. Do not waste your money on this. There are other DVDs that give you a great Yoga workout without the low-budget, ugly blue background."
2,not the good for a beginner,"While the tape did go through variations of each yoga pose thoroughly, her stretches and touching her hands to the floor are nearly impossible for a beginner to mimic."
1,Where is the workout?,"It took me a while to figure out how to get to the actual workout with this DVD. I kept ending up at the beginning again. I hate when DVD's seem like they were just created from the VHS. There is a very long instructional section on how to do the moves, a short 15 minute workout and then a bonus section on backbends and forwardbends which I haven't tried because it looks way too difficult. This DVD just annoyed me and I probably won't do it again. What a waste."
2,Not for Us,"We just finished trying to use this video for the second time. Had to give up, the instructor is clearly competent but her smarmy new-agey announcer voice is just too irritating. Probably was supposed to be soothing; instead it ticked me off enough to come over here and write a review. It's difficult to concentrate on yoga poses when you want to tell the instructor to please shut up. Try the Yoga Zone videos instead. We bought the 6-video set. They have simple, good instruction by people who are speaking in their normal voices. Yoga Zone videos also do not have the unnecessary marketing fluff that is in the front of this one."
2,NO Meditation included.,"This is an interesting yoga dvd, although its clear that its made from very old or poor quality analog stock.She is clear in her instructions and you learn alot about a few clear and ""beginner poses"". the camera moves so that it is at the best angle for a particular pose. for example for one pose the camera will face directly at the instructor, but for another that the camera will be at the profile view of the instructor.however the reason this dvd scores so low is that it lacks any meditative training. aside from being a new age fad, yoga is a meditative practice. the dvd is devoid of most if not all semblence of mediation."
4,yoga for beginners,"I had this video for the vcr & I wanted to get it in DVD. I really enjoy the slower pace she sets and her gentle voice. If you are looking for a faster paced,"" flow"" version, this is definitely not the video for you. If you are interested in learning the poses and how to hold them properly, this is a good place to start. I will say even though this is on a dvd, it clearly looks like a video copied onto a dvd and it not the most beautiful scenery or anything. It does not have a beautiful ocean or mountain or desert scenery. It is an older video, possibly one of the first ones made, and the background looks like it. I have been practicing yoga for many years and I enjoy going back to this video when I need to get more grounded."
2,Yoga for Beginners,"This DVD was my first yoga DVD. I am a beginner. I found the instruction to be quite thorough but very, very slow. Too slow for me."
5,The DVD I received had a bonus Flexibility Workout included,"Just a heads up - if you are thinking about getting this AND the GAIAM Flexibility Yoga DVD, wait and see if the Yoga for Beginners DVD you order includes an 85 minute bonus flexibility workout.The picture here does NOT show that the beginners DVD has this bonus material, but the dvd I received did have this bonus material and it is the exact same thing that is on the Flexibility Yoga DVD.So basically I ended up buying two separate yoga DVDs when I only needed to buy one because the picture and product description on Amazon does not inform you that this beginner's DVD has the Flexibility Yoga bonus material."
3,Eh.,"There is nowhere to take a yoga class around here, so I do not know what it is really like. However, this video was not for me. For one thing, it seemed extremely disconnected, and Ms. Walden does not really explain how to move from one pose to the other. It is also very, very slow, and kind of boring. I recently got Shiva Rea's Yoga Shakti, and I have enjoyed that much more. I feel like I have a better idea of how to move and breathe in the poses, and it is more enjoyable, which is actually kind of important, because if you don't enjoy it, it's not very likely you'll keep doing it."
2,not what i expected,in this dvd it's nothing but them teaching you the different positions. there is no routine and you have to skip forward or backward to get to a certain pose.
1,Cheesy with a side of Cheese,When I bought this product I was expecting the video to be shot outside because the cover and the back of the DVD shows yoga being practiced in a desert landscaped setting. I had this video on a VHS prior and it too was practiced outside but this DVD was practiced in a cheesy 80s studio. Not only is the instruction super slow but it is a bit too informational. Using chairs and walls is a little too much for yoga. A simple short and to the point video would have been suffice but this video has way to much detail for a beginner. A positive side notes is that it would be a great video for someone who wishes to become a yoga instructor.
1,Worst Yoga Video,"I own about 6 yoga videos. I like to mix it up to keep it from getting boring. This is by far the worst of the lot that i have bought. I agree with another reviewer that the instructor looked and sounded ""spooky"". Can't put my finger on it but it was like I was back in the 70's again. All I needed was the shag rug instead of a mat and a lava lamp. Check out Shiva Rae and Yoga Zone dvd's, way, way better than this.Namaste"
1,Didn't get what I wanted!,"Was supposed to be a double disk & only got one! Plus, the one song I Wanted (New suzuki), would have been on the second disk, which I didn't get!"
4,beenie,"Beenie is so versitile. The man can sing, rap , write along with great beats. My all time favorite Beenie song is dancehall queeen. Play de music mista DJ."
1,Where is it?,"I dont know how this item is because as of yet it hasn't arrived.... I ordered it on May 23, it was to be shipped in one or two days from Netgrocer. Its June 10 and not here yet."
1,Book is indeed containing mistakes!Boy does it ever!!!!,"Another example of the book's mistakes comes when Carol's old high school football player boyfriend,Tank,pays a visit to the Brady house. The book WRONGLY claims he's from her college days!Mistake!"
3,I bought this?,Amazon says I bought this book even though I have no memory of it. I'm thinking it was a gift for my mom so she probably liked it.
4,All the awnsers to the Brady Bunch,"I really enjoyed this book its full of life and Barry Williams really did a good job in explaining the true facts of the Brady Bunch. But in order to understand this book you have to really be into the show or if you are not the book will still be kind of good but you will not get half of it. To all of those Brady Bunch fans who have not read this book read it you will know what I am talking about you will laugh all the way to the end. The book follows a great organized fashion where it has a episode guide, the history, how everyone was casted and who was suggested for certain roles, if you love the Brady Bunch you'll really love Growing up Brady one of the best books I have ever read although it may not be a real book even if you cant stand books you'll probably finish this one."
2,"An entertaining book, but too many typographical errors","This is a readable book, with numerous juicy tidbits of behind-the-stage gossip about the show. Unfortunately, typos and downright careless mistakes abound throughout the text. Even the word ""foreword"" is misspelled as ""forward"" on the book's cover. The publishers did Barry NO favors when they produced this volume!"
1,Misinformation abounds!,"The new edition of Growing Up Brady is flooded with mistakes-almost just like the old one!The new version's mistakes hit hard and numerously especially when the episodes are being described.A police captain in the U.F.O. episode is wrongly identified as being with the air force(to give just one example).Also, characters are sometimes misquoted.All in all,book is rather unreliable and a complete waste of time and money!"
1,"In a word ""confusing""!","The old edition of the book ""Growing Up Brady"" was full of mistakes for sure but hey alot of books on tv shows or any subject matter can make mistakes.The confusing part is why so many of the earlier version's mistakes were left in in the 1999 revised edition."
3,Greg and ...Carol??? .. Sitting in a Tree.......,"Although this is not a book, that you will want to read cover to cover (unless you are a die-hard Brady fanatic), this is an interesting account of the behind-the-scenes Brady drama. I found some parts to be rather amusing(especially the ones where Barry claims to be such a heart throb among the ladies of the Brady cast--keep on dreaming, Greg!) It mostly provided me with interesting tidbits of decades-old gossip from one of my favorite childhood shows. Good fodder if you're ever in a Brady trivia contest, I guess.It was a pretty decent book, though nothing earthshattering. I just hope Greg, oops I mean Barry, can move forward with his life and find some new ideas for his career. One can only live off of one's former glory for so long before it gets old."
3,Brady Shmady,I gave this book as a gift along with the one written by the actress who played Marsha Bradey. Was told the one by Marsha was a better read.
3,Growing Up Brady: I was a Teenage Greg,"Book was interesting, filled with little snips of what it was like behind the scenes. I was looking for a little more depth. The last third of the book turned out to be details about each episode, rather dry. I only read a couple of them before I was bored."
5,A VERY LIKEABLE READ,"BARRY WILLIAMS DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB TELLING WHAT IT WAS LIKE BEING ON THE BRADY BUNCH, ONE OF THE BETTER KNOWN FAMILY SITCOMS FROM THE 70'S. THE SHOW WAS CORNY, GOODY 2 SHOES AND UNREALISTIC. BUT STILL HAD A NICE HOMEY AND WHOLESOME TOUCH TO IT. I DID WATCH THE SHOW OFF AND ON, BUT MOSTLY TO SEE HOW HOT MAUREEN MCCORMICK AND EVE PLUMB LOOKED. BARRY WILLIAMS REALLY BRINGS BACK SOME GREAT MEMORIES AS HE TELLS US SOME GREAT STORIES THAT WENT ON ON CAMERA AND OFF CAMERA. THE MOST INTERESTING WERE, HIS DATE WITH FLO HENDERSON, INFATUATION WITH MO MCCORMCICK AND THE CONSTANT COMPLAINING AND ARGUMENTS CONCERNING ROBERT REED AND THE SHOWS WRITERS AND PRODUCERS. IF YOU WERE A FAN OF THE BRADY BUNCH THIS IS MUST READ."
3,Greg tells all.,"Good thing Barry Williams has a sense of humor about all things Brady. I bought this book as a present for my wife and made the mistake of thumbing through it and got good and hooked. It is a breezy look at Hollywood life from a kid that got to live the star dream. Williams treats the tale more as an informal and self ribbing chat between pals and it makes the whole ugly tale a readable treat for both fans and haters of the show. Recommended, and I hated The Brady Bunch. Go figure."
2,"Accurate, but . . . .","Maybe a half hour's worth of documentary in an hour and a half film, and nothing that you couldn't get in a William Shirer book or BBC's ""World at War"" series. In fact, most of this information is available in children's history books, and this film offers no new insight or angles. The only thing that kept me watching was the historical video footage, which has been cleaned up nicely compared to that on ""World at War."" Still, i was compelled to fast-forward through the protracted telling of a Goethe fairy tale (?!) with accompanying art. The awkward soundtrack music and thickly accented narrator also detracted from the experience."
4,The fusions,"I am currently taking the anthropology class of Dr. Stoller (Magic, Religion & Witchcraft. He gave the class quite a few great books to read, including his. From reading his book, I learned what the title actually means: the social world, the one we live in & the world of the spirits. These are fused when the spirits leave their world and come in contact with ours by taking a medium's body, to transmite a message. Its the possesion of the body and mind, the fusion we cant see, while the medium sees the natural & supernatural. I recommend his book and his teachings!"
5,"Becky Lee Meza, please record more","I do not speak spanish, and don't understand lots of the words, but Becky Lee makes listening to spanish music so easy. She has a real good range, and can sing anything I believe.I loved the movie Selena, thats what got me into Tex-Mex music. I know lots of my friends don't understand why I like this music, but its performers like Becky Lee, Selena, and Jennifer Pena, that can make more English listeners respond to this wonderful music."
2,It's not all that!,"I think Becky was given a record deal just because she played in the movie Selena and not because she has a singing talent. Sorry to say but Becky can't sing! It's no wonder why they decided to use Jennifer Pena's vocals for the movie instead of Becky's. There's just 1 song I like on this album and thats Chango Guango. Sorry Becky but Over the Rainbow is not the song for you. The album is cool though because it has a positive meaning to it, that is to follow your dreams but I'm tired of record companies giving kids like Becky record deals like they're giving them candy or something because they're making these kids think they can sing and in the long run their career is going to come to a halt. Proof: Why didn't this album go gold? And why hasn't Becky recorded another album in 6 years?!"
5,It is so GREAT !!,"Ok ! Here are the Canadian POPSTARS !You don't know them ????First of all, you have to know that they're not like SCENE 23 or EDEN'S CRUSH ! Why ?Just listen to the voices ! They know the way to make good songs and their voices are powerful !You don't trust me ?? Listen to the single ""Frontin' on me"" !It's a good R'N'B song which is for everyone !It's hot, it's cool, it's great : just buy it !!"
1,"very slow shipping, never response","Seller will not ship within 2 bussiness day, and will never reply to your email at all. You will hear nothing when you put an order."
1,DO NOT BUY! may sabotage your system,The driver on the disc does not work and will not allow you to uninstall it (or install a working one) because it scatters the files all over your system.Only buy if you enjoy having to clean up your system or reformat it.Never got it to work.
4,"Excellently hackable, compatible with the Raspberry Pi","The board is only 1/3 the volume of the chassis and the USB cable is attached to the board by a sensible pin arrangement by a regular 5 pin header.It draws a bit more power than you'd want to supply directly with the Pi, but it plays nicely with powered USB hubs. The built-in drivers in raspbian handle this device out of the box."
1,Doesn't work with Windows 7,"...actually, depending on the hardware revision of this device. I got the cheapest one that I could find (~$10), which was version A1. Windows 7 could not find a driver for it and would not allow me to install one manually. Some looking around on the web revealed that this revision is incompatible with Windows 7."
5,A good book for the aloe person,"A good book for both beginner and expert. It puts the aloes in 10 groups, from Tree Aloes to Grass Aloes with detailed desciptions of most aloes. It does not, however, have aloes from anywhere but South africa...but that is the only falt I can find with it."
4,Excellent book to buy,"Excellent book to buy. It groups the aloes into several useful categories based on their growth habits and color codes each category for easy reference. Ecological, historical, etymological, occasionally ethnobotanical/commercial, and horticultural details are given in a one page summary for each species listed along with a full page color photo of each species and occasional insets. One detail I would have appreciated is more explicit cold hardiness ratings but the author does usually mention whether a species is frost intolerant, can take light frost, can take heavy frost, or is freeze resistant, etc. I'm sure there are more complete aloe books out there but this is not only excellent for the beginner to intermediate aloe enthusiast but a pleasure to read and browse, even for the aloe-philes out there."
4,Great Movie,"This was a great movie in it's own right, but I found it lacking when compared with the series. I would recommend this to someone who doesn't have the time or desire to watch the entire series but wants a look into what Clannad is all about.If you have read through the Visual Novel you will notice that this presentation of the story is much different than any of the possible story arcs, where the series was fairly true to the primary arc with added events from in the others."
4,"Great, but not what I expected","I thought this DVD would be a movie based after the first series, but it's not! This movie came first, so it's Clannan & Clannad: After Story all rolled into one short movie! If you have not seen the series, I suggest you watch the series FIRST! Then watch this movie!"
1,Clannad Motion Picture = Suck!,"In my opinion this movie completely SUCKS compared to the tv episodes. I mean, the art and animation in this movie couldn't get any worse, the story is down right confusing if you haven't watched the episodes, and you get about one hundreth of the effect you would get if you watched the tv series. All in all; this movie SUCKS. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap. Don't get me wrong; i absolutely LOVE Clannad and Clannad: After Story, it's one of my favorite animes out there and in my opinion one of the best. But if you truly feel the need to watch this movie just go to google and type in clannad motion picture watch now free english (or eng sub whichever you prefer) or something like that and ill guarantee you YOU WILL FIND IT AND YOU WILL HATE IT!"
3,Series First. Then Movie. That Order,"I'll preface this by saying this movie is not bad by any stretch. I would strongly recommend to anyone that you watch the Clannad series before this movie. Though it covers the same ground, the series just has so much more time to do it. The film as it is has to lessen the depth of its characters and cut out and skim through certain plot elements and story points. It's just hard to fit everything into a timeframe as limited as a feature film. Like this it is essentially a two hour summary of the series. In the end, I enjoyed the film because I have seen the series. I am able to feel the same things I felt when watching the series because I've been there and hail the series as a masterpiece. Going into it blind, there's enough holding it back to give it a bad grade, but if you are familiar with the story and characters you will have a good time with it."
5,Clannad Is The Best!! <3,This is one of the best and my favorite anime's of all time! I am so excited that I have ordered this movie! I love clannad and i'd recommend this anime to everyone who love's a good bitter-sweet love story!! <3
4,Wonderful variety,I love this knitting book. There are some projects other than sweaters. This could be used by anyone from beginning to advanced knitting experience. Yarn selection is difficult in my area as I do not usually knit with wool for children.
4,Nice range of classics with some solid originals,"Boz gives the music that he loves so much a fine tribute . He states in his liner notes that he had a hard time choosing the songs - which I can well understand . I particularly like the original of his called 'Picture of a Broken Heart ' which has a great lyric and a fine groove .This album may make you go back to your blues albums , or may get you into the blues , which has many styles , no matter how you like your music .Buy this album and enjoy a good collection of material ."
1,Don't Use Virgin Mobile,"I bought a Virgin Mobile phone for emergencies, the coverage is OK, not fantastic. However after little more than a year of use, I turn it on one day and it connects itself to VM and announces it is 'updating' itself. After the update is complete, I can no longer text message. I call technical support, they say 'we can't fix it, and your out of warranty, you need to buy a new phone'.Thought it was a fluke and I got someone stupid, so I called them back, same reply 'you need to buy a new phone'.Stay away from Virgin Mobile, it's nothing but an expensive con trick."
1,Poor service: they can NOT activate the phone more than one month,"I bought a virgin mobile phone in the early of July and have been working with Virgin mobile for one and half month. They still can NOT activate my phone. Can you believe it? Good mobile phone carriers can get phone activated with 24 hours. I called them many many times to find activation status. Every time I was told that it is under investigation or it has been escalated. Finally I talked with their supervisor last Thursday and she gave me extra $10 for being so patience and she asked me to call back in 24 to 48 hours to get a new number. I waited one week to call back and was told that it was escalated to their headquarter and need another 1 to 10 business. I was tired to deal it with them. Today, I decided to return the phone to them. The phone is very good. But their service is disaster."
1,Try tracfone instead !!!,"Tracfone gives better deals in minutes.It is perfect for those with light, in town usage. It only uses one unit per minute, two if you're outside of your area code(roaming), and long distance doesn't cost any extra. The airtime doesn't cost a fortune, and you have no credit checks, or monthly bills. Reception is good because they utilize many different providers instead of just one. They also have a referral program, so you can earn 100 extra minutes for free if your friends and family buy one too(they also get 180 minutes). If you want a referral to get started with 100 free minutes, [...], I'd be happy to send you the link!"
1,Virgin mobile Sucks!,Virgin Mobile is a rip off!They don't give good service for one thing.Minutes go by too fast and I barely ever use my phone. I only use it twice a week with 3 minute calls.Its a complete rip off!If you like features Virgin Mobile is NOT for you!
4,"useful, a good gift","My mother died 1 1/2 years ago at 85. About eight years ago my young daughter gave a copy of this book to her. Grandma took a year to fill it out. Then she returned it to my daughter as a gift. Now that mother is gone, the entire family appreciates this little book filled with Grandma's memories.I have recommended it to many people since then."
3,Wonderful questions designed to be written to one Grandchild,"I loved the questions of this book they were so lighthearted and curious. I loved the lay out of this book, plenty of room to write, non glossy pages. However it is not spiral bound so the pages do not lay flat.Unfortunately I had to return it because the questions are designed to be asked by one grandchild, or answered to one grandchild. We have two children, and my sister has a child, we were looking for a book that could apply to all three grand kids.Some of the questions that posed an issue for us were:What was my mom/dad like? What kind of trouble did my parents get into as teenagers? Was it hard when Mom/Dad started driving? What was your reaction when you found out my Mom and Dad were getting married? How did you guys get to know me? Do you look anything like me? Is there anything about me that reminds you of yourself? Do you see anything in me that reminds you of my parents?"
4,we have a lot of grandparents!!,I really like how this book is layed out. It gives the user ideas so it doesn't have to be a journal.
2,Not as good as Astley's big band original.,"I was disapointed with the lack of sophistication in the film score of the Val Kilmer version of the ""Saint"". I was looking for at least one cut of the original bigband recording by Sir Edwin Astley from the 60's TV show. It is really much more powerful and big band jazzy than the vague references to the original score feebly quoted in the film. The original score from the British show in turn had taken snippets from the soundtracks of the 1930's ""Saint"" films. These early 1930's scores had snatched and transmogrified bits of StLouis blues and Claude Debussy. It all culmnated in the sound track of the TV show staring Roger Moore.Even the character's creator, Leslie Charteris, commented that Elstree Studio's score was the best musical impression of the mood he had in mind when writing the stories. Astley's composition had been out on vinyl years ago. Maybe it is time for Elstree Studios to re-release a CD version."
4,classic,this collection of songs represents a pretty interesting point in time to me. it has gathered a lot of different music types and every song is respectabledream within a dream by dreadzone is one of my all time favorite songs its just perfect for what i look for
4,One cool song!,I have never watched this movie. One of the songs is played as bumper music on the Midnight Radio Network. It's in the 12:30 a.m. timeslot. It's just a really cool tune so I paid $2-3 and bought the cd:-). I don't buy movie soundtracks. This and one more I have.
3,Techno-ized style popular songs.,"If you're not expecting techno stuff, you'll be disappointed. If you are, you'll be disappointed. If you're open minded, you might like it."
4,Very very good,"This is a great soundtrack, with good tunes. My only regret is that it failed to include the tune by the Smashing Pumpkins played as the Saint evades the hit squad in Holland Park (sorry can't remember the title). Other than that, I liked it."
4,"where are ""The Cars""?","great cd, but missing ""You're all I've got Tonight"" by The Cars. This song plays when he is smugly smiling after a slick getaway. Too bad it's not on the soundtrack."
5,I love it!,"I love the movie, and sometimes music makes you remember toughts that you think they`re gone.I buy this cd `cos I love Duran Duran`s song Out Of My Mind...When I decided to listen the cd I discovered a great album that becomes one of my favorites.I wait and wait for having this album but waiting has his reward."
4,Children have their own style of learning,"This book gives you recommendations on how to choose educational materials that would be to the advantage of your child's learning style. It changed my way of thinking that I should use what appeals to me as a homeschooler, not considering if it suits my child's learning style. Find out if your child is a Wiggly Willy, Perfect Paula, Competent Carl or a Sociable Sue. Know what learning situations they prefer and dislike. A treasure chest of information!"
5,Primer on numerical characteristics,"Prof. Casper J. Labuschagne has written a primer on numerical characteristics of the biblical text. In seven chapters we are being introduced to a great number of quantitative structures he has discovered in the Bible, especially structures using the numbers 7, 17 and 26. Furthermore this book gives an insight into the still antagonistic debate in theology about the validity of numerical research as such. We do not find a mathematical 'proof', but there is a lot of plausible evidence in favor of the numerical features Labuschagne has found. This book is an important contribution to the discussion on numbers as structuring devices in biblical writings in general, especially since there is no such thing as a 'textbook' on this subject.(More detailled information can be found on my homepage section review no. 2.)"
2,"The ""No Design"" Design Book","This is what it should be called. It has many images of so-so to excellent design. However, all of the images seem to be thrown around on the pages with no regard to the layout of the page or the sections of the book.The section headers were so faint that you almost missed them. Some of the images were bled off the page in such a way that you could not appreciate what was being illustrated. On other pages the examples were so close to the binding you almost have to rip the book in half to see them.It was hard to find what you were looking for or to focus on the designs themselves as the design of the book itself was so poor.Its OK to have a book with minimal text, but the design should be strong enough to support that."
3,Only graphics,I bought this book with a few other books because I wanted to learn designing. But this book only has pictures. It doesn't tell you why a design is good or bad. It doesn't teach you anything.But it has a lot of pictures and examples of graphics. So its a good buy for people who design for their living and are stuck or have a case of designers block. It can provide with good designing ideas. It can also help in colour combinations.But its not suited for beginners and don't buy this book if you want to learn about designing concepts.
4,No Explanations,"If you are looking for creative ideas for your designs, this book was specifically created for you.If you are new to design, this is not the best book for you. Like me, you may not know exactly what to look for in the examples shown. Included are book jackets, catalogs, calendars, posters, and other creative designs that you can look at for ideas. Unfortunately, they are just pictures so the detail does not always come out as you might hope.There are no explanations. With each idea are the client, the art director, and the creative firm. Sometimes, it will list the designer.Unless you know what you are looking at, and can see the different elements of the whole as well as how they interact, then this book will not be very helpful. This book would be a good reference for people with design backgrounds, but not for the beginner."
3,"Ordinary look, good bag","Bought this because it is a JanSport. However, the bag looks ordinary and old. Color does not look as vivid as on the webpage."
3,awkward handle,"I am returning this because it has only one handle, and that at an awkward angle - computer not held vertically."
4,Very good pricing,"I'm completely satisfied with the product and I'm happy to have purchased it at such a good price. My only slightly negative comment is that it took the product about a week longer to get to me than I expected. Again, the price couldn't be beat and I would definately buy from this vendor again."
1,The jury is still out on this one,"I've been very happy with the security package, but installing took days. Even the updates are slow. My computer has been slower since installing this program. I might have been better off getting Norton. This program offered free telephone service for problems and Norton charges for each call."
1,I like my money and so do you,"I just purchased this product (Feb 23 from Amazon) and I am not impressed with it at all. I have tried to register it and it won't let me. I tried 7 times to no avail to register this bad product. When someone can't even register this thing, what's the use? Other then to take my money. I have e-mailed, called support (on hold 30 min, I timed it) and my problem was still not resolved. I had to talk to some arib in who knows where? He just tells me the same thing the insruction booklet says and when he offers a new registration key, he hangs up on me. If you're smarter then me (I know you are) then don't buy this product."
1,"If you use a Wacom mouse on your PC, keep looking","I use a Wacom mouse, which allows you to draw (for those of you who don't know). Anyway, PC Cillin causes my mouse to constantly freeze when it does certain things. For instance, when I send a message in Outlook Express, it freezes my mouse for about 30 seconds. Don't ask me how it's doing that because I don't have any other programs that do that. I'm going to have to disable outgoing mail scanning.So far I'm not impressed by anything but the price."
1,Stay away from this antivirus /firewall software!!!!!!!!,"I unfortunately read the great reviews about this software(PC-cillin Internet Security 2005)and purchased it from Amazon.com.Had nothing but grief with ""black screen"",blue screen and freezing /crashing! Software did not recognise my sub account with Msn and would crash upon exiting the site. After trying to adjust the exceptions rules several times-I uninstalled this horrible software. I couldn't return it because I had received the rebate. So,I'm out $15.00! My computer is ok and I found out that MSN offers McAfee antivirus & firewall software free to its members so I've downloaded them and all's well with my computer."
2,I don't like it.,"I am running PC Cillin on 3 computers and Norton on 1. I will probably not renew PC Cillin. It seems to want to update large amounts of data every time I connect. I am using DSL and these updates are annoying, I can't imagine how people using 56k modems could stand this. Norton may do it too, but ifso, most of it is in the back ground and I am unaware of it."
1,PC-cillin...don't waste your money,"Once again I try and use a program which offers more for less money than Norton.....and I learn that I have again thrown away my money.PC-cillin ""looks"" like a good deal but when it comes to actually installing the program---flat out...it doesn't work. I have tried over the past week to register this product and to obtain updates...all to no avail. I have entered the serial number of the program and my email identity yet Trend Micro tells me that these are not legitimate. I have never had success with McAfee and now I can add Trend Micro to the list. Stick with Norton.....it is expensive but at least it works."
2,very weak,"I had an Norton Antivirus before that for 3 years. Since I switched to Broadband I decided to get a firewall. The revies for Norton Firewall were very bad. While reviews for the PC Cillin looked better, so I decided to give it a try. The installation is very easy, but...1. It's very very slow in Initialization. Every time I turn on the computer it takes at least 5 minutes or more to come up. at the begining I thought it's the firewall so I disabled it and tried again. No difference still more than 5 minutes. I never experianced anything like that with the Norton. It's very anoing. Some times I just need to check something quick and it takes forever. So if you turning off your PC every time don't take it.2. There it very leatle room for firewall control. But it doen't really meter to me since I don't need to allow any traffic inside.Home it helps"
4,Better software than norton,"I have used both Norton and PC-Cillin. This does not look as professional as Norton. Considering performance, I would say this is 100 times better than Norton 2005. Norton sucks and eats up too much of system resources. Even normal browsing becomes tough, if you have 128/256 MB RAM. It reminds with new viruses and updates with new patch."
2,"Unable to register properly, therefore cannot retrieve updates.....poor customer support",The interface is very easy to use. But since I installed this program I have been unable to retrieve updates because PC-cillin will not accept the serial# printed on my CD envelope. Even with another serial# sent from Trend Micro I have the same problem. The company is VERY SLOW and unresponsive. Maybe it's just growing pains.
2,"Good product, poor service","I bought this product based on independent reviews by consumer and PC magazines. The product's performance was OK, but customer service was a headache. The serial number on the CD that was shipped to me came up as ""invalid"" when I tried to install the software. I had to call customer service, who gave me two more serial numbers before the software would accept one as valid. Now, one year later I want to upgrade my software to the current version (to save $$ over a new purchase) and guess what? My serial number is invalid and in order to upgrade via the Trend site I will have to pay more than what Amazon would charge me for a brand new CD. I will most likely switch to ZoneAlarm because of the hassles involved in registering and upgrading this product."
1,AVOID ALL TREND MICRO PRODUCTS,If I could give less than 1 star for any Trend Micro product I would. It gives too many false positives when you don't even have a virus. You are going nuts trying to find where the virus is and there is not even one there as Trend told you there was. Avoid this like the plague and save your hard earned money. It's a piece of crap.
4,Works Great and good value,This is the second copy of PC-cillin Internet Security 2005 that I have purchased and I am very happy with it. I previously owned a Norton product and I can tell that the Pc-cillin is faster. Only thing I have noticed is that the spyware component doesn't seem to catch as much spyware as spybot.
4,Good product but beware of their mail in rebate process,"Product installed easily and works decently. However beware of their mail in rebate process. I got a card from them stating that my order was outside the specified purchase period. Seems to me that they could not read the order date on my Amazon bill. Maybe Amazon needs to provide 'store like' receipts so that these events do not happen.However what I irked me was that when I called to argue the point by showing that my amazon order date was well within the offer period, they suddenly claimed that I had also not submitted the original proof of purchase and that I need to re-submit it.So now there is no way for me to get my money."
4,So Far So Good,I've tried Norton software in the past and it tends to hog computer space and costs too much for what it actually accomplishes. This product is great. Easy to install and actually works.
1,Rebate is a joke,The product is ok but forget about the rebate - their excuse for denying me was that my request was posted 32 days after the order date - never mind that it was only 10 days after I actually received it.
1,Poor software quality,"I will definitely tell everyone to AVOID buying this product at all cost!!I tried installing on Windows XP atleast 5 times before abandoning any more attempts... Everytime, it would result in blue screen of death....I would return this product if they accept it!!"
2,Overrated,"Although I will have paid just $15 for this software (if the rebate is ever processed--6 weeks later it's still in just the 2nd stage of ""processing""), I am sorry I did not keep Norton. To my mind, PC-cillin updates excessively, and when it does, it freezes up all work for a significant period--something NOrton never did, even on my Windows '98 system. I can only presume the antivirus check and firewall are functioning properly; the spyware misses some of what my SpySweeper catches, and the other components are unnecessary for my purposes."
1,CPU hogger - sevaral reboots - waste firewall,"I've been using PC-Cillin2003 and 2004 for last 18 months. 2003 version is ok. but, Pc-Cillin2004 is a horrible version I've ever seen because of following problems.1.For every single virus/program update PC is keep on rebooting. Some times goes end-less loops keep you bothering with pop-ups 'Reboot machine for updated...'2.If you are using DSL/Cable router, Firewall is USELESS3.Tech support horrible. If they could n't fix it- they just hang up!!4.Makes your computer slower and boot time increases by 2 minutes.Finally, I'm started using freeware AVG anti-virus and ZoneAlaram and life become simpler.Bottom line-- Most of the five star reviews lacks credibility. Don't get fooled my reviews."
1,avoid like the plague....cannot register!!!,"I've used earlier versions of Trend's AV software and had good experiences, so I was happy to place my order for a security package that was value priced...boy was that a mistake. I installed the product and after attempting to run the update I received a ""serial number in use"" error. I was not able to resolve the problem with tech support, since they essentially spammed me with auto responses. All my requests seemed to fall on deaf ears. This is some of the worst customer support I've experienced with a PC product. Anyway, a week later I've pitched the software in the garbage and bought a competitors product."
1,OnLine Sales and Support,"It doesn't exist.I didn't even get to critique the software as I spent too much time dealing with why they billed me for four items (over $100) when I only bought one.I called, and no one could fix the billing error. I kept calling to tell them they had the wrong order being processed and I didn't want all this stuff they were shipping and each time I was put off to deal with it. Suddenly, a few days later, I was told it was now my problem as they had shipped it and I would have to pay to ship it all back if I didn't want it. They never changed from that position.It could be a great product but my company and I will never know. I will remember the firm as the one that tried to make us pay for their own incompentance."
2,Tapping my foot in Atlanta...,Tried the product but uninstalled it after only a few days....couldn't tolerate the extremely long boot time. I have no idea what the product was doing during all that time but one thing for sure...I got tired of waiting so I got rid of it and went back to ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite.
3,Almost but not good enough,"Basically let me list the problems.The anitspam and antispyware programs are weak and sometimes ineffective. Sometimes it actually increases the spam you get! Many times the antispyware does not completely remove all parts of the offending program your trying to get rid of!The Antivirus software is really strong but not as strong as Norton Antivirus 2005. It does use fewer system resources and scans much faster than Norton's though! I like PC-Cillin AV and for the most part it is almost equal to Norton AV 2005.The firewall is ok but the default settings leave it vulnerable and wide open! Be prepared to dig in to the guts and fix it yourself!In my opinion, you would be better off buying PC-Cillin Antivirus and using the free firewalls from Zonealarm or Sygate then adding a good antispam program and using many of the FREE antispyware programs readily available...like SPYBOT 1.3 !!!!I really like Trend Micro products but this one falls short."
1,Terrible Experience - Don't Even Consider This Product,"After doing some research, I decided to go with this product over Norton Anti-Virus. What a mistake that was. After installing it PC-Cillin, I tried registering the product so I could receive virus updates and other product updates but the registration process was broken. The software recognized my Serial number but when I tried registering it on their site, I kept getting error messages. I contacted support and they were very slow to respond and when they did, they were unhelpful. Even the instructions didn't match with how the interface of the software works. To top it all off, after 4 messages were exchanged with support, I received a message asking me for the same information I had already supplied twice before.Product registration seems like the most basic thing and if that can't be done properly, what does that say about the rest of the software. I will be eating the $40 I spent and deleting the software from my machine."
1,Avoid this one,"I have had system troubles since april. I run an xp machine. It started out updating every few minutes and then my computer would restart (bomb) excessively. I did several removals and system restores and pointed as well as operating system instals and reintalling trend micro and the problem is trend micro. I had been running the program since last fall without problem. There are some online articles that they have had some problems but I emailed them and they didnt bother to respond. The spam filter looks to be worthless as another person pointed out.After reinstalling my operating system, I got another 3 months of norton free and my system is stable. I guess that I will just buy a new virus software once the 3 months is over. I ran macafee last year and that worked ok."
5,Great product,I am extremely satisified with this product. I somehow thought other than Norton or Mcaffee no other product works good. But Trend Micro is as good as the Norton and Mcaffee. I recommmend this product.
1,You may be disappointed,"I switched to PC-cillin from Norton based on reviews read in PC World. Sorry I did it, and I'll probably go back. I never could complete the registration process. Customer service is terrible!!. Even though I was careful to mail in the proper information on the rebate, it was rejected. With Norton, my weekly updates were usually less than 500K bytes. PC-cillin is usually more than 10 meg!. That may be okay if you have a high speed connection, but with my 56K dialup, its a pain. The weekly scan completes without finding anything, then all buttons gray out. The only way to close the window is with task manager. It just doesn't meet expectations of the PC mag's rating!"
1,Refuses to register and Tech Support won't answer,"Purchased this for my in-laws after reading the reviews. Removed Norton and installed it and it refuses to register. Consistently tells me it is registered to someone else. E-mails and complaints to Tech Support produce NO RESPONSE. There's no tech supportphone number. Gee, I wonder why! Stick with Norton. This is a piece of junk with no customer support."
2,Forget the Rebate,"While I am happy with the performance of this software I am not happy with the people who process the rebate. My rebate was denied since I was told that I paid less than $25.00. The moronslooked at the price amazon posts ""after"" rebate. I tried to explain this to no avail. My suggestion is to find the lowest price and forget the rebate. Amazon should consider what Staples is doing by getting the rebate processed online. Very easy and very quick."
2,impossible to just update 2005 renew.,"My subscription is expiring in a few days and this suite is impossible to renew. They are trying to force you into 2006 security suite for the big bucks and buggy software. 2005 works fine until I have been thru the runaround 3 times with e-mail customer support. I won't pay for their telephone customer support, trend micro will force me to buy another brand because of this. Shame on you pcillin."
5,Good-bye Norton. Hello Trend Micro.,"I used Norton AntiVirus for over 10 years and finally got tired of the way it slowed down my PC. Switched to PC-cillin and it's like having a new computer.There are better firewall, spam blocker, and spyware programs out there, but this is the best antivirus program, in my opinion.Try it. You'll like it!"
4,good resource,"This book was used as a text in my university Buddhism class. It is not a detailed explanation of Buddhism but rather gives a glimpse into various traditions and important writings that have contributed to the growth of Buddhism. It quotes extensively from different sources and provides a glimpse into key points in history and from the lives of those who shaped Buddhism. Excellent book for students of Buddhism because of its informative and well-rounded approach. It may not be the best book, if read alone, for the more casual reader unfamiliar with the fundamentals of Buddhism."
4,An Informative Introduction,"Theodore de Bary has produced a fine summary of the Buddhist Tradition in India, China, and Japan. For the introductory student of Buddhism, who wants to get a bit beyond the cursory introduction of most college world religion texts, de Bary's compilation offers a very useful and informative introduction. Inside are collected excerpts of some Buddhist texts, from the time of Buddhism's inception in India to it final arrival in Japan centuries later. The text excludes much of Southeast Asia, so it has very little on the Theravada or Hinayana tradition, but it explains in concise form the differentiation of the Mahayana and Hinayana schools. Most dense and difficult (or perhaps just the most tedious) are the Chinese sources on Buddhism and emptiness, following the period of Nagarjuna. There are, however, many sources of rich information that a student of Buddhism will still find useful today."
3,History and comparative religion,"The impression I got from reading this text is that Buddhism is divided into many different sects with a wide variety of purposes and theories, one derived and modified from the earlier, former. This perhaps ignores the central theme of Buddhism, elimination of suffering, found in all Buddhist traditions. The information is probably accurate, although the point of view is necessarily from the outside looking into each tradition, whereas the reader would be served better by diving into one or other of the traditions and DO Buddhism rather than just read about it. One book: Buddhist Sutras: Lesson Book, which also quotes from this book, is all about Doing Buddhism, along with acquiring a good deal of information sufficient to become devoted and proficient. That, I believe is perhaps a better choice even for someone who believes in a ""western"" deistic religion."
2,Not what I'd hoped,"The puzzle itself didn't help one solve the crime, ergo making the puzzle was kind of pointles. As well the crime storyline is poorly written and has typographical errors. I expected more since it is affliliated with such a complexly written show. I do not recommend this item-buy the DVDs."
3,Mystery Puzzle Review,Great family fun--way to bring whole family together whether 2 or 10 people. Extra little something to puzzle solving.
5,Sleepy-time Favorite,My 3 month old son goes to bed with this cd every night. It's one of those children's lullaby ensembles that doesn't drive you crazy. I love the music and look forward to listening to it with my little one! I highly recommend this!
5,Beautiful Music & Words Helps Baby Fall Sound Asleep,"We received this CD as a gift when our son was born. Since that time, I have purchased 3 copies of the CD for other children. We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this Grammy award wining CD. There are five songs on the CD with each song having a vocal and an instrumental version (10 tracks on CD). Some songs' words are beautiful, while other songs' words are fun. During late-night feedings, I have enjoyed rocking our son while listening to this CD. This will be a favorite bedtime CD for years to come. There is a version with a booklet, which has the words to the songs, which we like having (The Rock-a-bye Collection). We highly recommend this product. And, Amazon's price for this CD is much better than if you purchase the CD elsewhere (at least it has been each time I have purchased it)."
5,hawaiian christmas angles,na leo has the sound of hawaiian christmas angles. thier voices are beautiful when singing traditional hawaiian music but they sound simply angelic on this cd.
3,Fabulous Versailles,"Versaille is fablous but NOT IN BLACK AND WHITE. I paid just under $23 for the DVD and was dreadfully disappointed because the movie was supposed to be and actually said ""In Technicolor"" and the whole thing was in BLACK AND WHITE. It was as if someone made a copy of the movie in B&W and was selling that one. It wasn't as fabulous in black and white and I don't like it nor want it that way. I'm about to return it for a credit to my account. So for this review, I will say no more."
2,Insipid and boring.,I didn't find the story interesting at all. I read this book because the story outline looked appealing and because of the warm review. I was disappointed. The story has not much substance and it is loosely-knitted.
4,Herman Miller Basic Aeron Chair - Point of Interest,I want to clear up exactly what is included with this chair.MOST IMPORTANT _ You get a tilt - but not a tilt lock. However you can reach up inside the bottom of the chair and flip a tilt lock gear to make the chair lock.I've been looking for the switch gear and spring on ebay so I can install it myself... for about a week now with no success - but you can lock the chair; however a switch is not included to do so.I can't stress this enough. Your $600 chair will always lean back. You cannot prevent it from doing so. There is no tilt lock. Hilarious and sad at the same time.You get arms - but they are not adjustable - unless you use a wrench to detach and reattach in the desired position.You get the basic raise/lowerNo lumbarNo forward tiltNo tilt lockNo adjustable armsHope this helps future buyers. I think the chair is great but I was shocked that there was no tilt lock.
4,Fabulous Chair but...,"You will use the warranty. The one I'm sitting in is about ten years old, and it has had to be repaired twice under the 12 year warranty. Fortunately, I live in Los Angeles, where there is an authorized dealer. I called, and the repair guy comes out after the parts have arrived. Before you buy, be sure there's an authorized repair facility in your area.Update: About to have its third repair under warranty."
1,"Do you need a ""spotlight"" alarm clock?","I read the reviews and was looking for an alarm clock which had somee nice features, like a digital radio, cd , decent sound, and where it wasn't too bright of a display. I read reviews of other alarm clocks to see if people complained of brightness and would move on if this was an issue. Well, this alarm clock lit up a relatively large bedroom. My alarm clock sits on my nighttable next to my bed and it felt like a flashlight blaring through my eyelids. I ended up putting a black wool hat on it to get through the night. I returned it the next day! If brightness is your sore point, don't get this alarm clock unless you want to be able to read by its light alone."
4,almost perfect,"I feel confident using these safety brackets, I installed a permanent one on my house for future exterior service & repair. I thru-bolted the unit w/ 1/2"" threaded rod, nuts & washers. They come with galv. 12d nails (I think) and that's fine if you have trusses or rafters just underneath the sheathing. (In my situation, I have stress-skin panels that are 10"" of foam with 4""x12"" rafters below that, so nails don't have the reach). I would like to see the manufacturer provide 20 heavy guage ceramic coated square drive (or star drive) 3-1/2"" screws for controlled installation and optional removal. I also use these brackets on solar roof installations (thinking not just of myself but for all future service scenarios). I think they should be a new construction building code requirement on all sloped roofs steeper than 4-in 12 pitch."
4,Great Power Supply,"Very quite power supply. I was able to install in by mid-tower case. The multitude of cables and their length made it a little challenging for small space. However, it is working well now powering my new 9400 GT Video Card. So far so good."
5,Great price and quality,"I bought this PS after a much more expensive Sunbeam brand one I purchased died. All I wanted was to get my PC to work, I have a SLI graphics card, 4 SATA HDDs, and a CDrom. I was impressed with the quality of this PS and have no problems with it. I also would like to add that this is the 2nd ThermalTake product I have used in the past year and that I continue to be impressed with them."
4,Works well,Nice unit works well no problems. It was easy to install and is very well made. I would recommend this item to a friend.
1,Weapon on system destruction!,"This power supply took out 4 hard drives and a motherboard before I realized it was the culprit. I finally got a power supply tester, just to prove it. When loaded with several drives, the power supply over-volts the -12v line. Attempting a warranty replacement, but I'll probably eBay the thing and avoid Thermaltake from here out."
1,Worst power supply ever!!!!!!,I bought this power supply to upgrade my system a day and a half later it died completely so i am back to using my old power supply. a great waste of time and money. Now Thermaltake won't honor the warranty
2,standa psu,This psu has only 1 pcie 6pin connecter no 8pin connecters at all.Lots of sata and standard 4pin connnectors though. if you need 2 pcie 6pins id sugest the 850w model it has a great wire package included and no need for extra cable purchases. I didnt even up using this since i couldnt get it to power everything i needed it too.
4,Good power supply for the money....,"I got this power supply for a new build. Worked great, easy install, my only ""beef"" is the paint job. This is supposed to have ""mirror"" black finish, but it looks like they put packaging on too quickly before paint was dried fully. Not a big complaint though as you cant see this thing for the most part anyways. And as always AMAZON rocks!!!!"
1,do not waste your time,This is the most boring book I have ever read. It started slow and never got better. By the time I finished I did not even care how it ended any longer.
2,Not As Shown On Picture,"My cat plays with the toy, but it is not what's advertised on the picture. What I received is a cheaper, smaller version, which is not expected to last long. It's much smaller than advertised and the pom on the spring is ready to fall off. Be cautious... At this point it's not worth my time or shipping cost to send back."
2,Don't buy unless you are very sure,"I bought this 74/76mm 15 flute oil filter wrench cap thinking that it will open my 2005 Mercedes E500 M113 engine. But after I received it, tried it, it doesn't fit well. So I didn't use it to open the oil filter plastic cap. Now I just keep it for the future if there is another car that I will buy and this wrench can fit.So please check carefully before you make a purchase. I didn't send it back for refund as the price is too low."
3,Caveat emptor,"In the process of removing varnish from old wood floors I used a floor sander for two of the rooms. Dissatisfied with the results I ordered the 5 gallon container of SOY-Gel and went to work. Long story short, it took about twice the amount of the product to remove the varnish and still left some shiny spots, after letting it sit for several hours and even overnight. The ""low odor"" claim is misleading - this stuff smells pretty bad and made me dizzy so that I had to work in shifts. And the cleanup (so far) is extremely messy and takes quite a while. Given that this has easily cost me twice the price of renting a floor sander and buying sandpaper (and I'll still have to sand it anyway)and has easily taken twice the amount of time I don't see it as that great of an alternative."
1,Expensive Waste of Time,This was an expensive waste of time. I followed all of the directions and the paint is still there. It does not work on brick!
1,Didn't work,Followed the instructions and had no removal of paint at all from the brick steps in front of our house.
3,"Worked OK, not great",It works a little better than a hot air gun on white paint on tan brick on my fireplace. The smell is pretty strong but not unpleasant.
2,"works well but not as ""eco"" as they want you to believe","Says right on the bottle that one of the components of the formula is known to be harmful to pregnant woman. Other than that, whenever i use it, i get a funny feeling on the back of my pallete. I would recommend using ample ventilation. It does, however work very effectively on peeling up paint!"
2,unimpressed,"It doesn't seem to work that well. I have smooth brick which had 2 coats of latex paint. I've gone through 2 thick coats of soy gel. Some of the paint is gone, but there is a stubborn, thin layer of goo left. Really, sanding is faster, easier to clean up after, and won't smell up your house for days."
4,Soy-Gel,"This worked pretty well. I had to use several coats, it doesn't work with one coat only as in their description, so the quart definately doesn't go far. It has NO bad smell, doesn't BURN bare skin so that is great. It is expensive, and only removes layers after several applications, but it does work eventually. You do have to watch and check when to remove the layers, it depends on outside temp and number of layers. I waited 12 hours the first application, but it had already dried, and was difficult to remove, I had to reapply more, so watch and check every hour or so. It does remove easily when it is still wet."
5,like magic!,"I can't recommend this stuff highly enough. Goop it on, let it sit for an hour or two, and the paint just wipes away. Fantastic!"
1,Did not work for outdoor concrete deck.,"Just bought two bottles to try and see if it works to strip the concrete deck around the pool. It did not work, it was messy and killed the grass next to the sides of the deck where I used it. I just wanted to avoid painting over the the two layers of paint on top of a nice red color concrete that I wanted to reveal. Disappointing."
5,"Incredibly, the book is version 8.6 & up, 2003","I've had this book for less than a day and it's already paid for itself. I bought Studio 8, which now has been updated to version 8.10 (eight point ten, not 1.0). I figured even if the book were good for the very first versions of Studio 8, OK. As soon as you open the book, you see that Jan refers to changes made as recently as v. 8.6; I was thrilled. This is a brand new book/edition. Studio 8 ships with a 258 page manual right out of the box, which is somewhat amazing for a piece of software like this, but admittedly, the manual is very remedial. This book, from the earliest pages, delves into some seriously useful components within Studio. I have a bunch of these Visual QS books; I'm always ammazed at the bang for the buck in every one of them, this one no exception."
3,Not good as Expected from the previous ratings,"There are some other similar 5.1 products which have more clarity and smooth bass ( this one as piercing bass ) and are of nearly same cost... Many sites show rating for this speakers as 5 stars, but my experience says its not..."
2,"Great Idea, but this one is disintegrating piece by piece!","The clip is very well constructed.Unfortunately, the rest is not. First, one of the side buttons fell off. Glued it back on. Next, the mark at the 9 o'clock position came loose and is floating around in the watch. Now, the LCD is all messed up and is displaying random junk.I love the idea of this watch, it just needs to be built so that it lasts more than a few weeks. Shouldn't be that difficult...."
1,Virgin Mobile Top Up Card,"Purchased card in August. When it arrived, it was 8 months expired. When I was finally able to talk to someone at amazon they replaced it right away.... with another one that was expired. Just buy it at a store."
3,Expired?,"Amazon is sending out top-up cards that show an expiration date of December 2004, but they still work. The expired status caused a moment of anxiety, but apparently it doesn't really mean anything."
2,Read the playlist carefully,"Read the playlist carefully. When I say all the artists attributed to this album I got starry eyed. But when I listened, I realized most of the songs were duds."
4,Good,"My cat love this tool, it is ver usefull TO remove the hair of my cat. The price is according WITH it"
3,I'm not Chinese,"I have not used this adapter yet, but I had a problem with the instructions that came with it. They are totally in Chinese. Fortunately, I was able to find the English version of the user manual on line and downloaded it. That was a little easier to understand, though I still found it a little tricky to get the North American plug to pop up."
5,worked well,Used this product in Slovenia to charge my computer and other electronic devices. Worked great and had no problems. Never used it with a converter but it worked great as an adapter.
4,Exactly what I needed,"Thanks so much! This was exactly what I needed for my trip to the UK, works great and easy to add to any baggage, thanks again!"
3,This product does NOT convert voltage.,"This fact wasn't clear to me in the product overview... If you plan to use this, the products you plug in have to be rated for 110-240 V, if that is the case this adapter works great."
2,Does not convert!!!,"This does not convert, it just adapts, you will fry something easily!!!That is a very important point to leave out in your ad!!! They are misrepresenting themselves!"
3,TRAVEL ADAPTER,THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL IN USA.I AM NOT SURE IF THIS IS GOING TOWORK WELL IN OTHER PARTS OF THE GLOBE. I WOULD BE TESTING THIS PRODUCTAS THE YEAR UNWINDS
1,Adapter Only - Not a Converter!,"WATCH OUT! This is an adapter only, not a converter, which renders it pretty much useless for me and most people. Amazon failed to disclose this. It is on the package only. Shame on Amazon."
3,Does not work in all UK outlets,"UK seems to use several different outlet types. Sometimes the fork would unlock it, but not always.The europlug side of this device worked just fine.Also BE CAREFUL. This is an adapter ONLY, not a converter. Make sure the device you plug in supports either 120 or 240, or you may fry something. Electronics are USUALLY safe, but read on the adapter. Hair dryer would be a very bad idea!"
2,Broke after one month...,"I brought this with me to Europe for the summer. It was working perfectly for one month. Then it broke. The problem is the flippable Euro prong portion of the adapter must have lost it's connection to the body of the adapter, due to constant flipping. Since I used it for my laptop, I must have flipped it at least one hundred times over the course of one month. But it still should not have broken so quickly. I had to scramble to find one in Germany. The only replacement I found had no ground, but it only cost me 2 euros."
1,"Don't be fooled when they say ""Works will all types of outlets in the U.S., Europe, Asia, China, and the UK""","I was taking a trip to Ireland and even though this product claims: ""Works will all types of outlets in the U.S., Europe, Asia, China, and the UK"" It does not in fact work for the power outlets in Ireland, which I have found are a three-pronged, blade style outlet. Think of the U.S. grounded outlet, except for the Irish ones are generally larger and all three conductors are like thick blades. Needless to say, this unit was useless to me unless, of course, I needed to use it as a projectile. Couple that with the fact that it does nothing to adjust the power cycle and what you have is a perfectly designed paperweight designed to look like something more useful. Do yourself a favor and buy from the experts on international travel, not Amazon, just because they are the first thing that pops up in a Google search. I got burned, maybe I can help you avoid the same."
1,overrated,"this is illustrated porn legitimzed by the academic art world; imagine for a moment this stuff was drawn by a man...in that case pepople wouldn't notice. but, it is painted by a woman so a whole feminist manifesto can be spoken aboutit. this represents the apex of the decline of art, the lack of ideas, the fraud of contemporary art. it is crap. oh and this book is not well reproduced with small pictures."
3,A little old but still good stuff,A good book if you want to get back at some one really bad . Most of the things to do were a little out there and hard to pull off although the topics on road rage and houses were good.0ver all if you are really mad I would consider this book.
1,"Damage Property, Injure People, Commit Crimes, Immoral Acts","This book has no dirty tricks. It only tells how to damage property, injure people, commit crimes, ruin reputations, and do immoral and disgusting things. One ""funny"" trick involves child abuse."
4,The draft horse industry standard journal,"The Draft Horse Journal has been highlighting the major shows and sales since 1964. Articles cover harness, working horses, draft horse keeping, draft health issues, and important horses, breeds, and horsepeople. Also important are the advertisements -- the DHJ serves as a directory of services and supplies for the draft horse industry. Expect to keep your issues for future reference. Usually around 220-240 pp."
5,The brightest I've tried,"I bought these nearly three years ago for my Volvo and they are still going strong. I tried the Silverstars as well as other brands but the PIAA Xtreme White Plus truly are the brightest. Based on other cars I've driven alongside at night, I would put these one step below factory xenons but about two steps above everyone else's standard halogens. Give them a try!"
2,"Great moralist, critic, wit","Kraus is almost unknown to Americans, but he was one of the shining social critics of the 20th century. He was the first major debunker of Freudian nonsense. He wrote brilliantly on language, politics, and culture. He was, like all great critics, fearless.This book is a mixed presentation, including many quotes that seem outdated or inscrutible. It also has the editor's odd and distorted rendering of Kraus.If you are unfamilair with Kraus you will be better served by Thomas Szasz's ""Anti-Freud : Karl Kraus's Criticism of Psychoanalysis and Psychiatry.""...The Szasz book provides fascinating biographical info about Kraus. Szasz has also nicely translated many of Kraus's pithiest and funniest aphorisms."
5,The Most AMAZING Album of the Year!,"I must admit that I was a bit apprehensive about buying an album from a relatively unknown band, with a MOST curious album title. But, let's just say, that ""pleasantly suprised"" is a huge understatement!! It has literally been YEARS since I have purchased a music cd, and been excited about each and every offering on it! It simply does not happen!! Well, I'm here to tell you, that it DEFINATELY happened with this one!! This cd runs the gamut of creativity, and diversity. I'm certain that anyone with an ear for truly artistic maneuverability, will be captured by it's truly haunting effervescence."
3,The Empty Summer,"This book, though unenjoyed by adults, will fascinate teenagers. I felt strange chills and goosebumps when i read this book, many of the things that Maggie, the main character feels, are similar to the normal feelings of a fifteen year old. The feelings of ""envy"" over a more ""perfect"" friend, that fear in losing trust, but that fear of losing the person altogether at the same time. A compelling read."
5,This book was well written,"I thought this was one of the best books that I have read. I could relate to Maggie. Not being satisfied with yourself. Always wishing you were someone or something else. I feel that this is a common feeling teens have today. I highly encourage you to read this book. If you are like me, you'll love it!"
1,"Nice TV, but ...","The TV itself is awesome. The picture is great. I've rediscovered TV with this baby. This TV is better on all aspects than the $2500+ Sony, Panasoic, Sharp, etc.Sadly, all LCD manufacturers hide a dirty little secret. My TV came with a dead pixel. J&R; won't ship me a new one unless Zenith authorizes them. I called Zenith. Zenith said I had to have 3 dead pixels or more for them to consider it defective. This dead pixel policy has been around since LCD technology first came into being. I could understand it in the early 90s, but the industry has had enough time to improve their fabrication process. They are ripping the customer off.This TV would easily get 5 stars if it didn't come with a dead pixel. Buyer beware!!!!"
1,Stay away from Zenith !!,"Prior to buying the TV we had a 27"" CRT TV that lasted 19 years. So we decided to buy a new TV since it was getting old. So in 1/17/2004 we bought a 40"" Projection TV with a 2 years extended warranty. The TV has been performing great and we have been very happy with it until just last week when we noticed ""blue shadows"" all over the screen.After looking over the manual and adjusting the convergence, no success.To fix this TV outside of its warranty will cost over $1,000 dollars, and with prices on TV's dropping it makes no sense to send it in for repair. It has basically become a disposable TV. We are very disappointed that our TV has only lasted 3 years. I'm sending it to Goodwill.I'm very disappointed that Zenith will not stand behind their products. My only mistake was not researching Zenith TVs prior to buying since I had full faith in the brand.I found other people on the internet with the same exact problem !!I'm sorry to say this was my last Zenith TV."
2,Poor Quality,The digital print I ordered had a big vertical seam in the middle of the print. The quality was not good. It also does not fit a standard sized frame so you would have to custom frame it.
5,Moody Neo-New Wave you can still shake your booty to.,"This album gets right down to business, pulling you right in with the infectious synth hooks and romanticool aural landscape of ""Atlantic."" The inclination to say it's all downhill from there is thwarted by a slew of other winners, my particular favorite being the instrumental track ""A Farewell to Love"" which sounds like the theme song to the happiest game show in heaven. There are times that you simply must cut a rug. Listeners will surely hear the inflluence of bands like Joy Division and Kraftwerk and one would be tempted to call it Goth if that weren't considered such a derogatory label these days. Still, these kids are no amateurs, delivering multi-layered compositions that switch from brooding to poppy and back again without missing a beat. A solid first album sure to please fans of Hotels live shows who have waited long and patiently for it."
1,Holes in the middle,I thought these were just plain old ordinary bottle corks. They aren't! they are for wood working and have a big hole through the center of them. I can't find just plain corks anywhere!
5,Don't Go Anywhere Without It,"It fits conveniently in my pocket, works like a charm. My friend had one for years and raved about it, and since he started me on carrying a pen wherever I go this was a great alternative to regular sized pens: the metal casing doesn't break and keeps the tip protected when not in use. When using it, it might seem awkward at first but after you place the cap on the other end, it feels like a regular-sized pen.The best part: I can write on nearly everything without worrying about the ink not flowing. I've written on metal, wet paper, wood, upside down and sideways without a hitch...aside from the ink eventually running out, this pen is unstoppable!"
5,Bratz Secret Date,"I love the Bratz ""Secret Date"" dolls..They all come with cool accessories and pretty apealing dates, but in my opinion, these dolls are for older girls, maybe 11+..I think they should change the age range for these dolls on Amazon, so that parents that have younger children know what the dolls really look like..I am twelve."
5,Entertaining as all get out!,"I got this doll a month ago and I was very pleased!Meygan has extroidinary clothes and hair style, date acc, and a cool dude to come along with her!**5 Starz!****She's a beauty! Great Collector's toy!!-Courtney Smith"
4,Just A Toy! by Roxxi,"OK, secret d8 bratz are just toys and weren't meant to cause problems. I luv bratz. i don't have this doll but i'm gettin it when i hav enuf money. [...]"
1,"YUCK, What image are we sending our kids",I am sorry but I dont want my daughter to meet a boy with a see through piece of string as a skirt. Yeah I bet the boys love to play with this doll too. Just think about morals before you buy this high priced hoochie.
1,stupid bratz,come on! this is so stupid! who wants to dress up like an idiot and go out with some guy she doesn't even know! not me.
1,Innapropriate!,"It is just stupid! For little girls, that is. They don't have to dress up like whores to go out with their ""secret dates"". That leads to ""date rape"". If you are a Christian, I reccommend that you do not buy this doll!"
4,Mr. Gabriels New Masterpiece,"I really enjoyed this score. It captures mood and feeling and I really love that. The score to a movie should make us ""feel"" what is happening. This one does that and more. It is always an added bonus when I listen to a soundtrack and it plays the movie over in my head. Peter Gabriel is awesome at doing that. I would suggest this for anyone who is moved by film music, but especially to those who believe that the soundtrack tells its own secret version of a story only known by the composer and your imagination."
1,Forget it!,"The world of martial arts deparately needs a definitive biography on Mas Oyama, arguably the greatest practitioner of all time. Unfortunately, this book is not it. It reads more like a 200-page press release than a balanced biography with many points of interest simply glossed over or never fully researched or explained. While Lorden is a skilled practiitioner himself, his skills on the tatami do not carry over to his writing. His elevation of the great Oyama approaches near diety status, which actually becomes humorous about half way through. Unless you get a review copy, save your money and hope that a much better-written tome on Oyama comes along in the near future."
2,Simplifying a complex master,"Lorden's book was a real disappointment for someone who has followed Oyama's career since the early 1960s, corresponded with him for several years during that period, and was inspired to begin life-long martial arts training largely because of his example. Lorden uncritically praises this great karate master, and no doubt Oyama deserves much praise for his accomplishments and inspiration of others. But Lorden provides little new biographic or anecdotal information about Oyama. The reader looks in vain for details of Oyama's training with Funakoshi or Yamaguchi, for example. Sadly, Lorden also overlooks some of Oyama's faults and failings, including his conversion to Sun-myung Moon's movement late in life, a step that cost Oyama many of his best followers and the respect of many observers. Lorden's description of the 100-man fighting ordeal was new and interesting, however."
2,"Interesting, but poorly written","As a new student of the Kyokushin style of karate, I looked around for biographical information on Mas Oyama, it's founder. This book, while it covers basic facts and offers a few interesting stories, was not written well. Chapter by chapter, the author repeats himself, sometimes almost word-for-word paragraphs at a time. It's disjointed, almost as though the chapters were written as individuals essays, then the whole lot thrown together for publication. He keeps jumping forward and back in time, making any chronology difficult to follow. It's a decent introductory read, but I'm going to look elsewhere for a real biography."
4,A story about the importance of dedication,"I really enjoyed this book and I went to Startbuck to have a coffee and read a couple of pages, but it all ended with that I read the whole book, from the first page to the last page without a break. This book tells the fantastic story about Mas Oyama, and even if you are not a student of Kyokushinekai, I would recommend you to read this book - it is the story about the importance of dedication and the ambition of always doing your best. In order to succeed, you often has to sacrifice something, and this book tells a enormous story about sacrifices but also what good that comes out of doing so."
3,The Book is ... OK,The book is OK if you do not know about Mas Oyama. The problem that I found; the writer repeats some parts in some chapters
4,"TOO MUCH? NOPE! CAN WE GET SOME MO', PLEASE!?","Where are artists like this when we need them? Brigette's CD is very tasty. Great musicianship and a great voice to go along with it. Standout jams are: the accoustic ""Morning"", the very powerful ""Action (Speaks Louder Than Words)"", the smokin' ""Fire"", the funk-groove ""Wishing"", and the melodic ""Writing a Letter."" A very damn good CD that deserves a CD shelf home (wink!)"
4,Very Nice Indeed,"Like one of the other reviewers I picked up Brigette's first CD because I was familiar w/ her mom (Quincy Jones'version of My Cherie Amour). The CD was $2 bucks on the clearance shelf. The first CD is very good also, this one is better or more mature. Ithink she offers more emotional control over her songs than the current generation of pop divas. I think you'll be able to genuinely enjoy this CD ten years from now, as opposed to a lot of other pop CD where ten years from now you'll only listen to the hit track for nostaglia sake."
2,A letdown,"I am a huge EJD fan but this was seemed like it had no plot. It was filled with sex scenes that took up 3/4 of the book and the rest was about the main character's husband.It was as if EJD needed to publish a book quickly and he made up something along the way. I gave this book two stars because of the unnecessary sex scenes and because of how the book ended. It was quite abrupt. Otherwise, I would only have given it one star because a tree was cut down to make the book."
1,Sounds like a bunch of porn....,"This book made me wish that as with renting a movie, one could get a warning on the back cover of a book as to how explicit the material will be. As I got comfortable and ready to delve into the secrets that the summary of Genevieve promised me, I ended up asking myself, when will the story start? This novel began with an overly long and explicit sex scene that left my eyes feeling violated. I got through about fourteen pages before I just gave up and put this book down because if EJD was not describing a sex scene, then he had his character thinking about it; like in a preoccupied, rambling sort of way that made my brain exhausted as I wondered when he was really going to get moving on with the plot.Even though I did not like Geneieve, the fact that Eric Jerome Dickey is a successful author compels me to peer at some other titles that I am seeing under his name. Chasing Destiny sounds really interesting, so I will make that my next read...."
3,Not a fan of Genevieve...,"I'm a fan of EJD books...but not this one. I was really disappointed with this book..I couldn't connect with the characters and the end was a let down. I'm from the south but nothing in this book was familiar or similar to my life. Oh well, I guess all his books can't be interesting reads."
4,A stunner,"Mr.Dickey has a very interesting imagination with all his books, but this one he most definitly put his foot in it..i almost started to hate the main charater, and oddly in the book there's not a name for him. Thats well hidden,it has a twist ending and i found my self crying, hating and addicted to this book during my read, Geneieve's husband was a dog for what he did even if he didnt know that he was sleeping with........oppps cant tell."
3,Very Dissapointed!,"Meet Dr. Genevieve Forbes (pronounced Zhawn-vee-ehv) who comes from a crazy family in Alabama. She has put her crazy past behind her and has kept her husband in the dark about many things. Meet her husband who narrates the book and shares his infedilty with us. And then meet Genevieve's sister, Kenya who is sexy and mysterious and cheats with her sisters husband. I am very dissapointed in Eric Jerome Dickey. I absolutely love all his books but was totally let down on this one. The storyline took way too long to get into. The first and last chapters sum the entire book up. I usually can not put any of Dickey's books down and are finished the very same day. It took me over a week to finish this one as I was not interested. Had I known, I definately would not have wasted my money and checked this one out at the library. Once again, a total let down:-("
5,Intense!!!!,This is what writing is all about. If you can't enjoy one of Mr.Dickey's novels than that just means you don't want to expand your mind. I love all types of African American genre but EJD always reminds me where it's really at he expands my mind without trying of course I had my dictionary handy but I learned as well as being entertained. This book seemed different to me a little more poetic and although I am not into poetry EJD'S flow was wonderful in this novel. As always he takes the readers mind to whatever state he is righting about. This is one novel that a real avid reader does not want to miss. Genevieve can you say it ZHAWN-vee-EHV . I still can't. LOL
3,disappointing,"I am a fan of EJD> I own all his previous novels. This one was very disappointing to me. He lacked the character development that his novels normally contain. Instead, he wrote a novel parallel to the Harlequin genre. If I wanted a sex infused love story I would have went to the romance section. I thought the story line was great with a lot of room to really delve into the characters. Genevieve's story was wasted until the last two or three chapters. Why not tells us more about her life as a runaway, or growing up in that trailer park. Instead the reader gets a lot of sex and little else. I didn't connect at all with this novel and it's a shame because that was never an issue with any of his prior works."
1,I think EJD is loosing it...,I did not really like this book. It was boring and it had a long drawn out storyline.I am not impressed by this book or the last 2 EJD wrote. What is happenning to him. I used to salavate for the release of a new EJD book.No more I am done with him... Weak storylines and full of words. A real waste of my time...
2,Disappointing,"I recently read Genevieve was very disappointed with the plot development and overall content of the book. Though he is a good writer, Eric Jerome Dickey has become increasingly vulgarin his depictions of intimate situations in recent years and it detracts from the quality of his work.While I'm sure there is stiff competition from people like Zane, that kind of writing doesn't appeal to everyone."
3,Surprising growth in EJD,"Genevieve is a book with alot of steamy sex and several unexpected twists.However, it is not written in the usual simplistic style that EJD has been known for since his first book Friends and Lovers.Instead it is written in a very amazing style of prose and imagery that in itself is captivating. It however is also difficult to follow at times.If you are a lover of poetry you will love this book, however if you are fan of his storytelling this is not one of his best."
2,Total Let Down,"I have every book written by EJD, got his last book autographed (meaning i stood in line a loooooong time) But boy was this book EVER disapointing!! EJD please go back to writing like you did with the books that got us hooked to running and buying your books the day they came out, and finishing the book the very same day! I had so much faith in the book I bought it at regular price in the airport in ATL (ya know how expensive the airport is!) I read the first chapter, and was hooked, then i had to force myself to finish the book, I couldn't believe I was reading a EJD book that was dragging real bad.Honestly you guys, go to the library or book store, read the first chapter, then read the last two or three chapters, and thats the whole book for you, and all those who say that this is his best work I honestly think ya took my advice and read the first and last chapter."
2,Disappointed,"Having read all of Eric Jerome Dickey's books, I was all geared and ready for a good read on Genevieve. But to my amazement I was very disappointed and regret buying the book. I wished I would have waited, but having a collection of his books made me wanted to add another. I thought Genevieve was suppose to have some big secret. Kenya being her daughter was it, but it was not a bombshell, I almost figured that much out before it was revealed. The story line was not that great. I guess I missed something with Willie Ester, I guess I was looking for something more dramatic that would cause such a hate for her. Mr. Dickey, please don't take this the wrong way, I like your work, but you were not made to write plots from the SOUTH, stick with Cali or New York. The south did you no justice with this one."
2,boring,this book was boring. I couldn't even finish it. Maybe some other time I'll try reading it again. the characters were strange i couldn't connect with them. the dialog/conversations were hard to follow. It was hard to tell who was talking. I would have to sometimes re-read a paragraph. Seems like EJD changed his writing style.
1,HORRIBLE,"THIS WAS HORRIBLE BOOK, IM JUST SPEECHLESS THIS IS MY 2ND EJD BOOK AND BOTH WERE JUST HORRIBLE THIS WAS WORST THAN CHASING DESTINY I DID NOT LIKE HOW HE WROTE ABOUT SMALL TOWN IN ALABAMA IM LIKE NO ONE LIVES LIKE THAT I COULD HAVE SWORN THESE PEOPLE WAS IS THE EARLY SIXTY THE WAY HE WROTE ABOUT THEM IT OBVIOUS HE OUT OF TOUCH WITH SOUTHERN PEOPLE THAT WAS THE FIRST STRIKE AND THEN THE FACT THAT GENEVIEVE LET HER HUSBAND SLIDE WITH SLEEPING WITH HER DAUGHTER AND NOT SO MUCH AS AN ARGUMENT NOT REALISTIC AT ALL HE WROTE ABOUT AND INTELLIGENT MAN WHO DOING AIDS RESEARCH TO SLEEP WITH A GIRL WITH NO REGARDS TO PROTECTION THIS WAS SO UN REALISTIC HAD THE MAN BEEN A LAWYER OR SOMTHING MAYBE BUT AND AIDS RESEARCHER, COME ON HIS LACK OF RESEARCH BEFORE WRITING IS SHOWING FROM CHASING DESTINY TO THIS ONE NOW I WILL BE READING SLEEPING WITH STRANGER AND WAKING WITH ENEMY'S AND THAT BECAUSE I ALREADY BOUGHT THEM DAMN!!!"
5,Best work so far!,"This is one of the absolute best novels I have read by EJD! Believe me, I have read all of them, except for the darker one, something about vampires or wolves . . . not my thing. He is one exceptional writer and it shows above and beyond in this book!"
1,"Horrible, horiible book","I am an avid reader yet I found this book a huge disappointment. I love EJD and met him in Nawlin's at an Essence festival and complimented his style of writing as a ""breath of fresh air."" However after reading this one, I would have to retract my compliment. I would have to agree with a couple of other readers that this isn't one of his 'best' work! I waited for something big to happen and it never did, the only exciting part was the true identity of... Ms. Kenya. I will continue to read EJD and I hope it gets better with time.Signed Hopeless and Disappointed"
4,Great but could have been better,"Eric Jerome Dickey.This is one talented man. I just finished his 11th novel (I read his previous 10 over the years) & I loved it each and everyone.""Genevieve"" isn't the best novel that I've read by Dickey but it is entertaining. Like most novels it has some slow moments & it doesn't really pick up until the end but when it picks up it's a page flipper. The characters were real & seemed so honest and when the book was finally concluding EVERYTHING made sense and fell into place. Nothing was left open & most of the issues that the book revolved around were solved.Needless to say I recommend this novel to readers who enjoy fictional novels that have the ability to make you laugh, cry, and feel for the characters. You did it again EJD!"
2,EJD....what happened to the juicy thrill?!,"I've been an EJD fan since his first book, and I must say this one was a true disappointment. It was interesting, but not enough to hold my interest. All of his books I read in a day or two. This one took forever to end. Madness...save your money and borrow from the library."
2,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of Eric Jerome Dickey's novels. I have purchased all of them However, this one didn't thrill me. It wasn't a bad book, it was just a little boring."
2,Genevieve.. 2 Stars,"Well... I must say that I was not all impressed. EJD is a wonderful writer, all of his books have kept me on the edge of my seat, especially The Other Woman. However, this book was a disappointment. The plot was unrealistic, and there were so many issues that were not made clear i.e. the narrarators father, the sisters relationship with her men (in general), the random aunts and uncles, etc. See my point. I read this book, going through it with the hope of a SUPREME climax to the story, and was let down. I look forward to his putting old characters in new books, but i was let down with this book.. again.I am still a fan for sure of Mr. Dickey's, but this book might have been the least favorite of any of his works. I still look forward to the next one, whatever that might be."
3,Not Bad,"If you are a fan of E.J.D. you may or may not be pleased with this book...the book starts out well and weaves thru both of the main characters pasts. it seems a lot of the conversations are forced, and all of the thoughts run together at the same time. also big plot twist at the end...is a shocker but it's at the end and the author dosent seem to deal with it at ALL. you can't just put something like that out there and then basically end the book...again not bad but not a great book...which i have come to expect from E.J.D. i will keep reading though...2ad"
3,What happened to the author I fell in love with?,"I'm a huge EJD fan, I've read ALL his books, and I have to admit this one is not his best work. His writing style has changed (and this is something that I am prepared to deal with) but this was too much of a stretch and started too slow; the most interesting, page turning parts transpire in the last couple of pages. Usually I'm so absorbed in a EJD book that I'm completely unaware of my surroundings, forgetting the concept of time, laughing out loud in public places and finish the book in a day or two. I had to force myself to finish this one it took me almost an entire week. I'm not going to hold this one (or Naughty of Nice) against him, we all make mistakes. I'm eagerly waiting for his next book ""Chasing Destiny"" to come be released, I hope it will be filled with the EJD style and passion that I have grown to love."
3,paper porno,I used to be a die hard EJD fan until he decided he wanted to be Zane Jr. Too much graphically sexual material but the plot and story line was pretty good.
3,Not the EJD I know and love,"I thought the book was extremely boring and hard to read until all of the ""facts"" were revealed. It has never taken me so long to read a book-especially by Eric Jerome Dickey!"
2,Like waiting for the green light,"I think the real reason I truly hated this book was because there was 2 character dialogue going on for quite some time. It was so boring. It was like reading a script from a play. I just couldnt get into it. Some parts were okay, I'll give it that much. Dont bother reading this. It's not even close to great."
1,Will the real EJD please write?,"I gave this book 1 star simply because the interesting events that took place in Genevieve's life. Other than that, I hate the style of writing that EDJ has adopted. I have to remind myself that I am reading EDJ and not Zane. I do not even buy his books anymore, I go to the library. This book was awful, as was his last few publications. The name (EDJ) is what draws me, the material definitely does not."
2,Porn disguised as what??,"Over the course of a week, I read three Eric J Dickey books. Whew!! Genevieve was the 2nd. I couldn't wait for the book to be over!! In the usual EJD fashion, the ending was very surprising and shocked me. But the plot was drawn out. I felt like I was being punished! EJD has a knack for totally knocking the reader off his feet. He masters the art of surprise. I didn't like any of the characters in this novel. They were all sickos and psychotic. The porn ( disguised as ""erotic"") was a bit much also. I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,A disappointment,"I have read several of Mr. Dickey's books and really enjoy them, however this one sas a disappiontment. A friend whom read this book said it was a great read but I would have to disagree. I was expecting it to end differemtly than it did because I already had a idea about how it would end before it did. I really found the ending boring, but i still intend on reading Mr. Dickey's other books."
2,All I Can Say,"I've given up on Dickey, this book wasn't good at all, and I gave an extra star. Nothing like his first books, and I know he can write better. I'm afraid to even read another after this one and Drive Me Crazy which wasn't much better to me."
2,Not one of my favorites,I've read all of EJD's books and this one is my least favorite books. It started off good but I don't know what happend. The book didn't really pick up until around page 170. I did finish the book and the last few chapters were goods and the ending will shock everyone. I will still remain a fan and hopefully I'll enjoy his next book.
2,not all that,"personally, I didn't really like this book. there was drama, but the only reason why i finished reading this book was because i forced myself to. The story seemed to drag, just to find out in the end genevieve's husband ended up having sex with her daughter. It was so boring throughout that when I found out, i was like oh well. I'm glad i got this book from the library and didn't spend my own money on it, otherwise i really would've been pissed. I don't recommend this book, but if you do choose to read it, get it from the library- don't waste your money on it"
3,Not his best.,"I was slightly disapppointed in this book. Although the writing is outstanding, the story itself left a lot to be desired. There were a lot of parts that would just drag and I found myself skipping paragraphs just to keep the story moving. Something I could never imagine myself doing with an EJD joint. I simply didn't like the story that much and I thought the main female character was an abomination. We learned her history too late in the story to care why she was the way she was. I just hated her.I know it's not that important but can husband have a name."
2,A Waste of Time and Paper,"Normally, I love EJD books, but this one was a total disappointment. The way the southern folk in the novel were extremely exaggerated. Shoot, I don't blame ""Genevieve"" for changing her name and moving far away...Anyway, I digress. The novel was a pain to get through and the whole story moved with the speed of molasses! Please pass on this if you can help it."
3,Steamy with Surprises,"This book was okay, not up to par compared to Sister,Sister, Friends and Lover, or Milk In My Coffee, but I did enjoy the book. The first half of the book was kind of slow, introducing characters and plenty of sex; the last half is where the book got interesting, even had a shocker that I wasn't expecting; I think there should be a continuation to this book and I'm looking forward to more from EJD."
3,Just OK,"The book is a OK read. If you are expecting the same type of excitement and anticipation found in his earlier books (The Other Women, Milk in my Coffee, etc), you will be most disappointed. The first chapter reeled me in, but after that the books seems to drag. I forced myself to finish it because I had borrowed the book. His writing skills are still exceptional, full of so much detail and imagery that you can picture the characters and their sorroundings. However, the story line is a little weak. The same hold true for Drive Me Crazy. I like that his writing has become more ""hard core"" almost like Zane. I just wish he would stick to his old formula for the story lines."
3,Wasn't quite what I'd expected from an EJD novel...,"I'd dropped off reading the last several EJD books, and decided to pick this one up... I must admit, it's okay, but I'm kind of dismayed. The explicit sexual tone in the book is a far, far cry from the earlier novels he's written, and that's disappointing in itself.I'm failing to place where the explicit sex had anything to do with Genevieve's secrets from her past... other than a few items that I won't mention here (out of spoiling the book)."
3,A New Approach,"I have read all of Mr. Dickey's novels....with the exceptionof Drive Me Crazy. I'm sure I will back track, and read thatone as well. However, I must say that Genevieve must be anew approach or something. It doesn't seem like the typicalJerome Dickey novel. I like the typical Jerome Dickey novels...meaning so good that I can't put it down, and thisone didn't do that for me. His humor eroticism, and subjectmatters have always made his books page turners. Genevievedidn't capture such. I have always liked his writing, andhow he brings forth the characters.Nevertheless, I will stay true as a fan, and continue to readhis novels. Keep putting them out Mr. Dickey....can't waitto read the next one! Always a FAN."
4,A Spicy Southern Page-Turner,"I loved this book from the first page. As a hardcore EJD fan, (I've even seen his movie Capuccino) I found that the author's intense change of pace was well overdue. Though seemingly over-the-top, Genevieve's plot and language warm the reader and speak to the Southern, misunderstood child in all of us. The twists at the end had me begging for more!! As a married woman, I identify with both the unnamed narrator and ""JHAWN-vee-ehv"" and applaud their unconditional love for each other. Though the book deals with an affair, it is still rich in emotion, faithfulness, and ultimately loyalty. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars and not 5 is that it is so unlike any of his previous writings, it may leave loyal fans disenchanted. Nevertheless, it still earns a Top Five Standing in my book."
4,Searching for inner truth....,"This book starts off with you on the edge of your seat, if there is such a thing. The characters are very realistic, and for people who are married, they may be able to relate to a lot of what the characters in the book are going through. The man is having an affair, but it is not as simple as it seems on the surface. He and his wife, due to an unfortunate event, are forced to go back in time and examine their past, unveiling some secrets which seemed to be forgotten. The man in the story seemed to be some nymphomaniac, always craving sex, which in a way, made me feel sorry for his lady, but you have to read the story to see why I'm saying this. I gave it four outta five, because there were some spots where the main character(Genevieve's husband) did and said some stuff that ran me hot, and this is coming from a man. Nonetheless, it's definitely another good one by Dickey."
2,Wasn't Impressed,"I am a big fan of EJD. I like all of his beginning books such as : Friends and Lovers, Sisters, Milk in My Coffee, Cheaters, and Liars Game. I also thoroughly enjoyed The Other Women and She Drives Me Crazy. But this book just did not do it for me. It was a very ""ok"" book w/ a good ending. I know that I do not want to wait for the last 20 pages for a book to finally get good. This falls in the same barrel as Between Lovers and Thieves Paradise which I couldn't even get through. If you see this book at the store it would be best to just skip over it."
4,A Keeper!,"I tell you about those skeletons! i truely enjoyed this book. it started off a little slow...but one turn of events and i couldnt put this one down. its about opening up and accepting your (horrible) past and where you came from, so you could free yourself from it."
5,Time for a change?,"Every once in a while an author might decide to change his/her style of writing. Change is good, and in this case, it seems as if that's exactly what EJD did. I've always been a fan and I always will be. Even though this book did not compare to his other books, it still remained a well written, captivating story that held my attention from beginning to end. Since EJD is known for surprising his readers, I look forward to reading any and all future reads."
4,"Hot, hot, hot!","Never thought I'd read a book whose first sex scene was on the first page! Talk about grabbing the reader! But surprisingly, it is not the sex that makes this book so riveting. It is the story line and how E. Dickey keeps us guessing until the very end! It is amazing how each character is someone we have all met before. We can see each one of them, especially at the funeral, where all hell breaks loose! Dickey is a great story teller. He fully develops each of his characters with a skill that few writers possess. We see their faces, feel their passions, and know their pain. They are made naked (psychologically) and we like them anyway!I am so glad that Dickey is young. That means I can look forward to many more great novels. Thanks!(by Sandra Manigault, author of Fragments of a Woman's Life)"
2,Not One of EJD Best,"This is book was full of stereotypes that took away from the novel. Plus the plot of the book was so slow that the time it becomes interesting. I've frankly just stop caring. The novel Genevieve Forbes seems to have the world on a string. Great job,husband and a brand new life. But she just can't escape her past. Her husband is basically a horny idiot. But the surprise ending is the only thing good about Genevieve."
2,I've heard every line and disruption before,"I've read a lot of Eric Jerome Dickey novels and I feel that I've heard every line and disruption that he is using in this novel. Maybe, he has used some of the lines in his previously novels; it seems as if he just cut and pasted them into this book and gave it a new title and cover. First time readers will love this novel. However, loyal fans like me will be very disappointed."
2,I HATED IT,"I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THIS BOOK. I WANTED TO PUT IT DOWN AND NOT PICK IT UP EVER AGAIN, BUT ONCE I START READING A BOOK I HAVE TO FINSH IT. FIRST SHE WAS TRYING TO RUN AWAY FROM HER PAST, THEN I DONT KNOW WHY HER HUSBAND STAYED WITH HER. SHE MADE ME SICK AND I LIKED HER SISTER MORE THAN HER. I WAS KIND OF HOPING THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD HAVE LEFT HER FOR HER SISTER INSTEAD OF STAYING WITH HER. ERIC JEROME DICKEY HAS BEEN SLIPPING IN HIS LAST FEW BOOKS I HOPE THE NEXT TWO COMING OUT THIS YEAR WILL BE BETTER.ASHLEY"
3,Not Up Par!,I received this book accidentally from a book club. I usually send them back but thought I would keep it since I read other EJD titles. I was very disappointed. This story had so much potential but EJD did not do such a good job of holding my attention. I finished this book hoping it would get better. Still an ok read but I would suggest you borrow or wait until it comes out in paperback.
5,A league of his own,"As writers evolve, they sometimes lose readers who want them to write the same material over and over again. That would be like living your life the same way everyday. Dickey is the master of drama wrapped in prose. THis is my second time reading this book and just as delicious as the first time. The art of writing is being lost, but Dickey follows his own course and delivers everytime. Genevieve delves into the quiet psyche of a marriage and just how unbalanced things can be, even though it appears normal to the outside world. In between the quiet of relationships is where the real drama lives. Great read!!!"
3,Genevieve was okay,No doubt the family in this book was one twisted family. I wanted to know what going to happen next the beg was slow but I am glad the family Secrets & Lies came to rest. I can say this book is okay not one his best book.
3,Genevieve,Although Eric J Dickey is one of my favorite Author's I was confused on more than one thing in this book so I am kinda on the fence with this one. I never got the concept of saying the Title name eventhough I felt I was saying it right I never was sure. Then I really didn't get it about the sister was it her daughter? When book's get complicated I kinda finish them up and remember the goodness about it.
4,I loved the dialogue,I absolutely loved the dialogue between the husband and wife. It was witty and insightful. The plot was excellent and the ending was a shocker. A must read!!
5,Haven't Read a Twist Like That in Awhile!!,"I am a huge fan of Mr. Dickey and have read everything he has ever written. I absolutely loved this one. Most of his novels have me absolutely cracking up. This didn't have quite as much humor as his previous books have had but it was excellent none the less.My emotions were all over the place orginally feeling sorry for the narrator of the story Genevieve's husband, and then almost turning on him at the end. This book had a great twist at the end that I had to clasp my hand over my mouth and say ""Oh My Gosh!!"", good thing no one else was there with me or I would have gotten some looks. I haven't read a book with a twist like that in quite some time. Bravo Mr. Dickey you just keep getting better with time. I eagerly await the next one."
3,Just a tad disappointed,"This book is not like the other he has written, but it is still a good book. The book had a few little twists. I was glad to know that Genevieve let her husband know that she wasnt as in the dark as he believed when she let him know she knew what he was doing in her ""sister's"" room. Genevieve came off as a cold person, but in the end I was beginning to get to know why she was the way she was."
5,Keeps getting better and better,"I have yet to read a book by EJD that I have not liked; this story was great! it kept me on the edge of my seat, it's a must buy! But come on people please don't give away the ending!! this is not the place for an editorial just review the book without telling the story! If you must tell a story then write yur own book."
3,So far it is garbadge to me!!!!!!!!,"Don't get me wrong folks I love EJD, but so far as I have been reading it is boring me, can someone make me feel better and let me know when it is going to pick up b/c i am so ready to find out all these secrets she has. I am on page 97, please tell me in the next 10 pages I will soon be in awe please tell me. Someone personally email or send something threw here b/c so far i am not impressed, it seems to me after Liar's Game everything went downhill for EJD. AND I TRY GIVING HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT BUT LATELY I HAVE NOT BEEN IMPRESSED. email is jerseychick28226@yahoo.com"
2,NOT DICKEY'S BEST,"I am a GREAT EJD fan and pretty much read all his novels....Genevieve didn't hold me as much as the others have..wasn't quite the page turner,I thought it would have been. I was a little disappointed. The first chapter grabbed your attention ( sex always does).....but after that, it left much to be desired.The descriptive narrative of Odenville could have been deleted. I would have gotten by with less info on the place itself and would have benefitted more from the description of the characters and their past. The last couple chapters kinda just hit you with all the details you were yearning and lived up to the Dickey name....this made me realize that all was not lost!As a hardcore Dickey fan, I still had a good read but not as good as I had expected....."
4,Entertaining,"This story is about a man who is torn between his wife and his sister-in-law. At first glance, it wasn't my cup of tea, and at first I had to get used to the choppy feel of the writing style, but I actually enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. I've only read one other book by EJD (won't give the title) but I wasn't all that impressed with it. Genevieve was better. I don't exactly recommend it to the younger readers, but for adults that can handle the sometimes graphic nature of the book, you will most likely enjoy it."
4,ZHAWN-vee-EVH,"""ZHAWN-vee-EVH"" that's how you pronounce the name of the book and also the name of the female lead. Genevieve and her husband are going through some tough times. Her husband feels that he is emotionally isolated because he is not aware of her past and revealing her own past is a great deal to her as even she does not know how she would handle it. Both of them forget about their ghosts and live their lives with Genevieve being the lady who always looks forward. Make love like Paul, forget about the past and love them as you never did before. But for her husband a cancer, the expereinces of the past are what makes him. But all this is going to change once they go to the hometown of Genevieve to attend the funeral of her maternal grandmother. The people they meet and the affair of her husband with Kenya who calls Genevieve her ""Sister"". I really admired the book and am looking forward to read the earlier one, ""Drive Me crazy"" kind of backtracking on that a little bit."
2,Ok,"The story was boring. Believe me I understood the point of these characters...the fact that they were both living lies, and the issues of shame and secrecy in the black community.................................but it was still boring. Not one of his best at all."
2,Conflicted views,"First off I love Eric Jerome Dickey, and I'm a loyal fan who has every single book. However this book was completely different. I just was not feeling the book I couldn't get into it. His other books are usually hip, but this book was slow and dry to me. It took me 4 days to finish the book,and the end left me hanging. I couldn't believe it was a Eric Jerome Dickey book, but if you have to have this book wait until it becomes paper back so you won't be too upset, and feel like you wasted your money."
4,EJD has impressed me!,"I usually stray away from the typical ""girlfriend"" novels due to the formulaic plots. Eric Jerome Dickey is known to be an author who churns these types of novels out with frequency. I read Genenvieve on a whim; I read the first couple of sentences and was impressed! EJD's style has changed! His earlier novels are very ""girlfriend-y"", however this book shows literary talent on his part. I enjoyed this book and will be checking out EJD's other more recently written novels."
3,It wasn't what I expected,"This was my first book by this author and honestly I do not see why he is so popular. It took me more than 2 weeks to read the book, I had to stop, put it aside and read something else because I just was not getting into it. A week later I did return to it and continued the read. Surprisingly, it did get better, and towards the end I just couldn't put it down. Something else left me disturb while reading Genevieve. Can't remember the page but somewhere in the book it stated that Bubba Smith was gravedigger's stepbrother, I think he meant half brother. There is a difference between stepbrother and half brother. If grandpa smith is both the father of gravedigger and bubba smith, why are they stepbrothers instead of half-brothers?"
1,CAN U SAY BORING,"BORED me almost to death. Nothing to make me almost wanna cry, laugh, or keep reading basically. Just one shocking little thing at the very end at that. Definitely get this one from the library or borrow or buy cheaply. Sorry EJD."
5,Heart-wrenching and beautifully written,"Bagdasarian's first novel, based on his great uncle's childhood, is one of the best books I've read this year. The story is not only compelling, but the language the author uses is exquisite, as he describes the three years an Armenian boy survived on his own during the holocaust carried out by the Turks. The book opens with the famous 1939 quote from Adolph Hitler: ""Who today remembers the Armenians?"" After reading Bagdasarians books, we will all remember."
3,Incomplete,"Definitely not for younger readers, this memorable tale lacks the depth that would be expected. Bagdasarian tells of the horrors and tragedy of the Armenian Genocide, but fails to provide much historical background. It is of course important to know of the humiliation and despair, but readers would have been better served if we knew what was going on with the soldiers/armies/nations who were involved in the conflict. Instead we only learn of Vartan's personal hardships. Though important, without historical information the last 100 pages or so become tedious. I have read many memoirs written by survivors of the Shoah in order to learn about the horrors suffered by the peoples of each region. Bagdasarian's story is more generically horrific. It therefore lacks a completeness that is necessary to provide a reason to choose this novel over an historical account of the genocide or more poignant memoirs by holocaust survivors."
5,A Must Read for All Armenians,This is the best novel written thus far on the Armenian Massacre. It was a touching story especially becasue it was written through the eyes of a child. Give a copy of this book to a friend. The truth will spread!
5,One of the best books I have ever read,"This book is a gut wrenching honest look at the Armenian Genocide, and once you start, you won't put it down. A truly human story."
4,Forgotten Fire,"This book was my first foray into getting personal about the Armenian experience during the genocide. In my family the stories were kept hushed. I understand why now. One hears of poverty and death, but with this dignified account of a young boy's survival you cannot ignore how generations are changed one person at a time by racial ""cleansing"". This book is not for children."
5,Well worth reading again & again!!!,"I've owned this book for a number of years & I find it is DEFINITELY a ""keeper"". My wife can""t understand why I drag it out & re-read it every Fall. I'd read & enjoyed Ruark's fiction in my younger days, but when I stumbled across ""The Old Man & The Boy"" it reminded me of times in the woods & on the water with my own father & the life lessons I was taught at those times. Both books together are simply a double treasure."
5,"Read as a boy, this book shaped my adult life.","As a success in my field, I was questioned by my trade organization what management books I kept on my desk. Only one: The Old Man and the Boy."
5,Old Man and the Boy / Old Man's Boy Grows older (2 books in one),I heard great chat about these books and have to agree that both are great reads.
1,Come on!,"Who in hell would buy this product from you guys? You don't even state what the works are! When are you going to learn that classical music is not wallpaper? Basic necessary information: 1. composer 2. full name of composition 3. performers (i.e. orchestra, soloist, etc.) 4. conductor. Ideally also, 5. date and place of recording. All you've given us is #4. We don't even know how many works are on these discs. In other words, it's a worthless page the way it stands. And the sad thing is, you've got thousands and thousands more just like it. How do you expect to sell this merchandise? Can you even begin to imagine how frustrating it is for us prospective buyers?"
5,My kids can't get enough....,"These episodes are a little more exciting than the ones in the first two volumes, but to my kid they're all ""awesome"". These are the episodes included in this dvd:The mysterious HyomaThe Magnificent AriesThe Silver PegasusThe Green HadesConquer the Tag-Team BattleBegin! The Survival ModeWarriors in the Deserted IslandThere are at least 17 episodes that come after these that I know of (on my dvr) so you can expect 2 or 3 more dvd's."
3,Bayblade book,"I sent this book back, because it is not appropriate for a six year old. It is for an older child"
5,Another good British Mystery,"Love the main character, John Thaw,--same good series as all the other mysteries he's acted in."
5,Iron supplement for iron deficiency anemia,"This product is great for treating iron deficiency anemia. If you take one Tsp each night with vitamin C (or not, it just helps with absorption) you should be back to normal in 1 to 1.5 months.Taste is very metallic but all are. a little sweet so I dilute the teaspoon into a little bit of water."
3,iron supplement is good but ad is incorrect,I purchased this for iron deficiency anemia. Ad says it provides 65 mg of elemental iron. Bottle says it provides 44 mg of elemental iron. I needed the 65 mg dose. Not sure how to resolve this. Will be contacting Amazon for assistance with this issue. Otherwise a good product.
1,Yuck,"I don't expect vitamins and minerals to taste good, but this stuff is so bad I cannot continue to take it. I took it 3 different times and was hoping that I would get used to it but I can't take it! It's not something you can hold your breath and get through either. The taste lingers for a long time...kind of like a tin can. I have taken liquid iron supplements before and it was not this unpleasant."
3,Liquid Iron,"What can you say? Any person who enjoys taking vitamins and understands the importance of healthy red blood cells, will understand the value of iron liquid form."
2,Nasty,This stuff taste like i was eating raw fish. Yes it's good for me but it's oh so nasty. I had to go back to my pills cuz I couldn't take it anymore.
4,Works Great,This product was very easy on the stomach. The taste did not bother me at all when put in orange juice. I took it three times a day as stated on the bottle. I highly reccommend to anyone who is iron deficient.
2,Nice jacket if you like a very plastic feel,It is much like putting on a very stiff piece of plastic without much confort at all. It looks good - but I wore it only once. It doesn't breathe well and the body moisture quickly is captured making underneath feel like a bad sauna.
2,bad cd,"The music is great, but the cd skips a lot! I cleaned it, I checked my cd player, so that's why I say the cd itself is bad."
5,Now this is good R&B,"I remember when After 7 first burst onto the scene in 1989 with the huge hit Can't Stop. However it was their ballads that made the group very strong. Ready or Not, Can He Love You Like This, and Till You Do Me Right are all classic slow jams in their own right. However my two favorite After 7 songs would have to be Not Enough Hours In The Night and One Night. Not Enough Hours appeared on the 90210:Colleage Years soundtrack back in 94 and One Night is a sentimental slow that express's love at it's best. Other notable slow jams that appear on the disc include Gonna Love You Right, Night Like This and Baby I'm For Real. I hope we haven't heard the last of After 7 because this is what good R&B is all about."
4,Good information. A pleasurable read!,"Just finished Logsdon's book and will surely be re-reading it and using it as a reference. I purchased this text, along with Rodale's Encyclopedia of Organic Gardening, which I think will be more useful in terms of practical advice. I found The Contrary Farmer more helpful in terms of reiterating the very reasons why I am thinking about moving to my own small farm. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone wanting to figure out whether s/he wants to be a farmer or to anyone looking for ""a day-in-the-life"" type stories. However, Logsdon gives well-written, often laugh-out-loud funny, and definately contrary ideas about how farming is much more a lifestyle than a mere job."
2,Loud and crude,"You get what you pay for on this one, I should have seen it coming. I liked the circular cover design but the fan/heater is brutally loud, parts are cheap, doucmentation is substandard, and it requires 20A wiring to boot. This goes in the mistake column, I had to throw it out."
2,config problems,I used a dual prosser Abit VP6 Board and had to move my four hard drives up to the the lower four Ext. bays because the hard drives when installed in the lower 4 Int. bays pushed against the ram. That left me two usable Ext. bays and my ATA100 hard drives were more than 15 inches of cable away. Also there are no side access panels. Ext. bay covers fit loose and buzzed a little.
4,Serves its purpose,"This product has worked well so far for my one-year-old. It is a little flimsy and I hope he does not figure out how to pull it down any time soon. The only problem was that I did not realize you are supposed to have 6 extra inches on the ends, but fortunately I had ordered just enough."
1,Would be nice if you looked at items before you ship 'em.,"I got this on time and on budget. However, the pre-drilled holes were not pre-drilled. Lucky I had equipment in the field to drill, or I would have been even more irate. I'm surprised they didn't just send me a chunk of plate steel and a can of red paint. Come on now."
5,Excellent Reference,My favorites were the Swedish Meatballs and Finnish Egg Cheese. Have yet to try them all but have not found one that I didn't like.
3,"good book, but no pictures and confusing layout","The recipies are great, as is the history and culture information. However, this book has zero pictures of the finished product. For a person of Scandinavian heritage this may not be a problem, but for somone who has never experience many of these dishes a picture of what i'm trying to create would be helpful. Additonally, the layout is non-traditional. I didn't think this would bother me when i ordered the book, but it is annoying when looking for a specific recipe. One needs to know which feast the recipie is associated with to locate the chapter it will be found. Both of these do not detract from the quality of the book or authenticity of the recipies, but they do impact my ability to enjoy the book."
2,Disapointed by reprint,"I am very disappointed by the reprinting of Scandinavian Cooking, we have had the previous printing and loved the photographs of the foods. We wore out the old copy with love and use, and ordered this edition, the colorful cover is misleading there are no photographs inside. Very disappointing."
4,not bad,"It does help absorbing oil and has a fine texture. The jar looks frosty when I received it, but after a little research, the reason seems to be the kaolin."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"Being a fan of retro literature and its parodies, I picked this up thinking it was pure camp. Remarkably, Twilight Girls is quite serious and only occasionally melodramatic. The first story is the basic ""coming out"" story with Val discovering ""what she's missing"" in Toni Molina. The sequel is the follow through in their relationship. More than romance, Twilight Girls also paints a vivid portrait of 50's America, the airline industry and even a glimpse into animation. The descriptions of Val's stops along her odyssey are palpable, yet don't stray into verbosity. Christian seems way ahead of her time and I kept checking the copyright date to make sure these stories were actually 40+ years old."
3,3 Movies- One Single & One Double,"The movies themselves are fine. The only problem/inconvinience was that one disc had one movie & the other disc had 2 movies in one. It was a bit confusing because that particular disc was ""blank""...meaning that it had no title on it so we were not sure which side was the correct one. Once we played it we wondered if the 2nd movie would be next. so we were wondering where the 3rd movie was. Unsure what to do I flipped the disc thinking that I'd be risking playing the ""incorrect"" side but found the 3rd movie on that side."
1,Dumbest Sci-fi series ever....,"This was such a stupid series. The stories looked like they were lifted from All My Children. The acting by Wagner and everyone was wooden, and there was no script, as for the corny effects, FORGET IT, THEY ARE NOT WORTH TALKING ABOUT."
1,Soy Gel Paint Remover,"Two rather expensive gallons of the soy gel paint remover were purchased from Amazon.com and used on two small (4' x 10' and 5' x 6') concrete porches. The gel was left in contact with the painted cement for as long as 24 hours. In none of my attempts was the soy gel capable of removing more than two layers of paint. Trials were run over a 10 day period such that as many as 5 gel applications were used over. the same area. The first two coats of paint were never removed through soy gel application. This product is very expensive and works very, very poorly"
3,works but not as natural as I wanted,I bought this product to strip many years of paint from my hardwood floors before sanding and refinishing. I wanted something with low fumes and fairly saft to work with since this would take many days. The product does remove the paint fairly well but the fumes were enough to make me ill even with the windows open so a mask should be used. I'm also glad I opted for gloves even though they didn't seem needed my plastic putty knives started to melt. The cleanup was also much more difficult than I was lead to believe it took a good deal of wiping and scrubbing long after the paint was up to remove the sticky residue. I will go back to readystrip or a similar paste for the remainder of my floors.
2,Not for New Cabinets,"I recently attempted to removed finish from my bathroom vanity which is in a new home. They were a natural maple, and I wanted to add some color with stain. Unfortunately, the finishes on newer cabinetry are extremely difficult to remove, and soy gel didn't do it. Perhaps it would be fine for paint or other finishes. Based on other reviews, I may try it on another piece when the need arises."
2,Better for small jobs.,"I purchased a gallon of the Soy Gel and was excited about using it! We have a solid wood entrance door that needed to have several layers of paint removed from it to either stain or paint it. I read all of the reviews before I purchased it. So, I suppose my expectations were high. Soy Gel is an awesome idea (Go Earth!) However, it took A LOT of elbow grease to finish the door. The Gel is very messy AND you will have to open the windows. It seems to work better on smaller spaces--I allowed a friend to use some on an old metal post and it worked fine for her.I planned to use it on some cabinets too, but it's not worth the trouble!"
3,"Decent Stripper, but not Wowed","Perhaps, I was expecting too much from all of the great reviews. I applied at least three coats of stripper to various painted pieces before giving up on it. It appeared to remove only 1-2 layers at a time. Using a carbide blade definitely helps, but the process was still incredibly slow and did not come close to removing all layers of paint. I tested varying degrees of wait time, with disappointing results all around. The only area where I was able to remove paint within three applications was on a door that had originally been stained; it also bore less layers of paint (maybe four to five). I gave three stars because it was much more effective than any other non-toxic stripper I have ever used. However, the effectiveness of actually removing paint is a higher consideration for me, so I probably would not purchase again."
3,It's okay,"I have never worked with any paint project so this is the first stripper I used for my kitchen refinish project. It did what it suppose to do, no smell and so on. But it is so sticky, paint still wet after a few days. We tried the citri stripper later, it is much better, no smell, but leave with dry paint, plus much cheaper. So try that first, you can get that orange jell stripper even from lowes. This one only available online so you can't even try it"
5,great stuff,"Not to sound redundant, but this stuff is very good. A bit pricey, alas, but it works great on any painted surface."
5,amazing stuff,"IT is as advertised. Works effectively to remove paint, can be left on as little as 2 hours or overnight.It is very sticky so I would recommend protecting floors, areas of the wall, etc and changing shoes when leaving the area you are working in, before going into the rest of your home."
1,Would give it 0 if I could,"Bought this to remove one coat of floor paint. Soygel after 6 hours removed 40% of the paint perfectly and the other paint not at all, but what it left me is a softened paint that will not come up and has left a coating on my floor like sticky gum. In short this proruct ruined my floor and I have been forced to buy a concrete grinder.The product was down for 7 hours. I then tried another test of 24 hours with the same result on one of the sections that was untouched.Also there is a strong smell from this product, not too noxious but there is absolutely an odor.I think if I just used this on latex it would work but for me to prepare for tile this product has been nothing short of a disaster. I really wanted this to work."
4,"If you can use a heat gun, it's a lot quicker","I'm stripping 75 year old window frames. The inner most layer is the wood stain, followed by varnish, oil paint & the final outer layer is latex. The latex is repeatedly patched over in some places. Any time the paint popped up, the former owners just chipped it off & repainted that side of the window. I have been leaving the SoyGel on overnight.Good points: No smell & I can sleep in the same room. Safe on hands. Cleans up with soap & water. It does a very good job on the top layer on latex.Bad Points: Repeated application did not do a complete job on the next layer of oil paint. Finally resorted to a heat gun, which is faster, does a better job; but smells. I will go back to the SoyGel to get the varnish off.In conclusion, SoyGel can be very tedious, but safe & non-toxic. With the heat gun, I gear up with goggles, mask & ear protection."
5,WOW!! NO LETDOWN HERE!,"This book was awesome. I am so glad I picked it up and read it. I love Ted and Frank's books and could not wait for this one. As usual the moral story really sticks in your mind and I love the self evaluation this book makes you do. I started it Wednesday night at about 9:30 and read until 2:00 am because I did not want to stop, I finished it Thursday. Prepare to flip pages as fast as you can. Looking forward to the next book from either of them and the movie of this coming in 2007."
3,Expected More,"This was my first book by these two gentlemen, and although I didn't hate it, I expected more. I actually liked it a lot until they went into the basement, and then I thought it got a little bogged down. Just an OK book."
3,Eh,"I read a comment by Ralph Winter on the book cover of this book stating; ""...then blew me away with a final twist I never saw coming."" After reading that, I thought to myself, 'I bet it isn't going to be as big a twist as he says.' And I found that I was right. I knew what was going to happen all along.The fist 100 pages or so were too slow for me, and the characters' backgrounds and personalities annoyed me enough to almost put the book down. All the while I was wondering how this book would make a good movie, because what I was reading so far had no appeal.But once I passed that 100 pages and the book started getting into how crazy the house was becoming, I couldn't put the book down.I didn't really like the storyline and I feel the ending was kinda weak."
5,My Favorite Book of Fiction!,"House is my new FAVORITE book of fiction! It's scary, it's insightful, it's creepy, it's fast-paced, it's GREAT!!! It is NOT slow to get started! Don't read it alone in the dark....."
2,"Quite Frankly, its bad.","This book had great potential the first 200 pages, but then spiraled to a corny plot line. Any book that ends with ""Shoo""!, should be thrown in the garbage. This book should have stuck with a more supernatural atmosphere instead of going so bluntly towards the religious fanatical. I know Frank is a Christian author, but sometime I feel he waste his great writing style on such a boring topic. I think from now on I will reserve my religious literature cravings for the Bible. I am so disappointed in this book."
3,Kindle Readers: Try Before You Buy,"[Note: I've only just begun this book, so this isn't a proper review.]""House"" has been on my To Read list for awhile, so I didn't bother to check out the sample. Bad move. This book has a more stylized font than I've seen in other Kindle books and I'm finding it hard on the eyes. I've read many, many Kindle books (on a backlit screen using the smallest text size), and I've never had a problem before. But this font looks much fuzzier, almost like a too-light photocopy. Adjusting my settings helps, but had I sampled, I would've gone with a paperback. Hope this helps."
3,What??????????????,"This book has left me really irritated. About halfway through, I thought it was the greatest mystery/horror story ever. Great characters, imagery, compelling story, etc... Then the authors started all this religious craziness disguised as a metaphor. First, the victimized characters in the book are not evil and the idea that they are and are responsible for ""creating"" this situation is just stupid. And when they started yelling, ""Son of Man, Son of Man, Have Mercy on me, blah, blah, blah.."" I was just so disappointed because I felt like a truly brilliant novel was obliterated by the authors' need to turn it into a morality tale. Great writers tell stories. Sermons are for preachers. Going into this, I had never read ""Christian Fiction,"" a term I thought was redundant. If you are religious, you'll probably like this, but why bother? There is plenty of great fiction in the Bible."
1,Terribly disappointed with this book,"I can't believe that I'm giving anything Frank Peretti had a hand in a 1-star rating. Frank Peretti is one of my favorite writers and I waited anxiously for this book to come out. I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed in HOUSE.The book is just plain boring and somewhat stupid at times. I understand the symbolic representations, but thought it was just too repetitive and mundane. Perhaps it was just too long.I read the book in one setting and thought about giving up on it after the first 150 pages or so, but I just knew that it HAD to get better...well, it didn't. The ending was a total let-down and was almost like an afterthought. It seems like Peretti and Dekker just said, ""All right, we're finished...end of story.""I'll continue to be a Frank Peretti fan, but I just won't recommend this Peretti book to others."
1,BIGGEST WASTE of time EVER!,"One star is too generous! AAARRRGGGH! I am still mad about this book and I read it 3 books ago! I loved Ted Dekker's ""Three"" and I enjoyed Peretti's children's books I read with my kiddos, so I was looking forward to the arrival of a collaboration. But it was utterly silly! If I start a book, I have to finish it. Okay, that's my own fault, but I had to MAKE myself read this to get it over with! I wanted to burn the book when I was finished to make sure nobody else I knew ever read my copy.The ending? Well, ""Shoo! Get out of here!"" was embarrassing! Shame on you, Frank and Ted!"
2,OK but not up to usual standard,"House was obviously written after a film deal was in place. It reads like a script badly joined together. The analogy is good at the end, but wish christian fiction writers could come up with some original ideas (in the film area) and not go down the well trodden route of haunted house stories. This is a combination of ""the others"" and every haunted house movie you've seen and just because Frank and Ted have come up with a good analogy at the end does not justify the existence of this book. The usual wonderful descriptive, well character defined writing in both their works is sadly lacking here. Maybe it would have been better if it was left to one author."
1,House,I thought house was poorly written and completely predictable. I wish i hadn't wasted my time reading this book that could have been written better by so many more talented authors.
2,Disappointing,You have to hold on to your hat and focus on every page of this fast moving story...not Peretti's best.
1,Totally Horrible,"This book is so bad that words cannot describe it. I could not believe how bad this story is. I love Frank Peretti, but this is unforgivable. It seems as if two people, Frank and Ted, had an idea to write a book together but never actually spoke to each other. Who cobbled this mess together? Was it some editor who was running late for the bus and just carelessly added a page from Mr. Peretti and then a page from Mr. Dekker? Come on! My twelve year old son, who doesn't even like to write, could come up with a better, more organized, sensible story than this mis-matched, confused, awfully written waste of my time and money."
1,boring,"I checked this book out from the library in hopes that it would live up to my expectations of a horror/thriller book because I am a hardcore horror/thriller fanatic. However, the beginning was so boring my brain felt like it was caving in. All I can say is that after three boring uneventful chapters, i couldn't go on reading it. Save yourself the time and read something else."
5,a book you cant stop thimkimg about,This book will have you thinking and thinking bout it till you pick it up and read it. once you start reading it it draws you in and before you know it your sitting on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. dekker and peretti have made a great book!
1,House - audiobook version review,"For me, House was strange, repetitive, and disappointing. The same scenes seem to happen over and over, and the action is difficult to follow. The narrator did a good job, but there were a few editing mistakes. I didn't finish the story - and don't need to find out how it ends. Try some other works by these authors - they can both write a great book, but this work does not reflect their talent."
3,"great read, skip the movie though",I watched the move first and then wondered if I really wanted to read the book. Having read some of Mr. Dekker's other books but none of Mr. Peretti's I wasn't too sure if I would enjoy the story. Every book of Ted's I've read I've loved and of course I'm not familiar with Frank's work. I would have rather it been written souly by Ted though.
3,Pretty Good but needed more characther development,"First time I read a book by either of these authors. I am big fans of Preston/Childs, Some Koontz, King and others. The storyline was pretty fast paced and suspenseful and it did keep me turning the pages until the end. However, I was disappointed with the character development. I never really got into any of the characters. And I kept expecting something exciting or thought provoking to happen at the end and that all this supsense would lead up to something...but there were no surprises that I hadn't already figured out, so therefore I was a little disappointed. Something seemed ""missing"" from the whole story too...not quite sure what...The book was ok. These two can write a good suspensful story, but character development and an ending that knocks your socks off in some way would have been good. I will try these authors again, because I got through the entire book. There's many books I never get through because I can't get into them!"
3,"Great authors, decent book","Before I read this book, I was pretty excited for it. Two awesome authors coming together to write a story that had a potential to be great. After I had read it, I was a little disappointed. It had a good start but the middle seemed to just keep going on and on with the same type of thing. After I read it, I kept seeing more and more symbolism behind the different aspects of house and the book became alot better.This is definately not the best book by either or Peretti or Dekker. I think this is partly because they both have totally different writing styles that are hard to join together. If you don't like this book and are only famailiar with one author, don't let it turn you off to the other.Overall, this book is worth reading because of it's great symbolism and a decent story."
3,Caught in between,"Being a follower of Christ, and a Stephen King fan...this was a decent book. So not to ruin the story for those of you who have not yet read it, I would say it a cross between, the movie wrong turn, and a carnival haunted house story! The spiritual images dealt with in the novel are real to life, things that many struggle with everyday, and I appauled Dekker and Peretti, for trusting their faith in God so much that they would include Him in their writing. I felt the story could have been told a little differently but there was suspense, and the characters were likable.I would just like to say to chris, below...Jesus does love you."
1,"Poorly written, leaves much to be desired.","Peretti's The Oath was the first ""adult"" book I read, and I could not put it down. This one was the opposite - I didn't really want to pick it up!I read the first 170 pages because I had nothing else to read. Finishing the book took some effort.The action is hard to follow. Whose doing what? You ask yourself a lot. Normally this drives me nuts and I have to backtrack and find out, but after a while, as one reviewer said - who cares?The book started off good and had potential, but it crashed!The whole book was basically the 4 characters running and hiding and beating each other up. Kind of like a big 100 paged action sequence that is difficult to follow. There was no plot development or character development.I don't recommend wasting your time on this, but if you must, get it from the library."
3,good til the end,once it got weirdly religious at the end i was turned off. It was suspenseful throughout and it kept my attention
2,Hard Read,I have read many books by Frank Peretti and have read some of Ted Decker's. I have enjoyed both. I really like Frank Peretti's books. But I had a hard time with House. I really had to struggle through the first half of the book. After that it was a little better. But as a whole not near as good as others. So it is my opion that if a reader can make it through the first half to the book they may wind up liking the book.Pastor David McGee
1,Horrific - but not in a good way...,"My dog has coughed-up scarier stuff than this. The writing wreaks of high school literature class hackage, there is NO character development and the author apparently cannot resist interjecting blatant, clunky messages about spirituality that destroy any semblance of pacing and suspense.If you are so unfortunate as to have purchased a copy of this book, do yourself a favor and instead of reading it simply leave it in a glass case overnight with a copy of ""The Shining"" and when you wake-up it will be gone. Oh, and ""The Shining"" will have appended a nice 100 page prologue written by unicorns. HORRIFIC, SCURRY unicorns."
3,"Good Book, Forced Ending","This was a good, scary story until the end. The ending really disappointed me."
2,dreadful,"I get allegory. I understand that's what is trying to happen here, but a writer still needs to craft characters and the story.The four protagonists: Jack, Staphanie, Randy and Leslie are interchangable. There is no moment in this book where the reader gets a chance to develop a rapport with these people. Instead, they are instantly thrust into the crisis.The plot turns on dialogue, and when the same words could come from any of the characters, the story dissolves into a mess."
1,I Wish there was 0 Stars,"Like others, I had high hopes for this book. Sadly, I was disappointed. As a voracious reader who keeps 5-6 books going at the same time, I usually force myself to finish even the worst of books in the hopes that perhaps they just had a bad start and will improve further on. This was one of the most poorly written books it has been my misfortune to purchase; it was a complete waste of money. The action was confusing and puerile...written at junior-high level, at best. I have tried to force myself to finish, but I'm halfway through and reading it has become a chore. This is one book about which I will not know the ending, because I honestly don't care what happens! If you feel you must read it because of the good reputation of these 2 writers, then do yourself a favor and check it out from the library; don't waste your own money on it. I wish I could get a refund."
2,didn't work for me,I usually like these authors but this collaboration didn't work for me. It turned out to be some kind of clumsy allegory that made little sense and lacked a clear plot. I was hoping to like this book but came away bored and disappointed.
2,Not what I expected......,"As someone who has read nearly everything Frank Peretti has written, (& enjoyed it)...from ""This Present Darkness"" on,..... there was just too much unbelieveable in ""House"". I found the beginning quite attention riveting, but as the story unraveled it became stranger & stranger. I'm not sure what Ted Dekker contributed....but my guess is this book is more like Ted Dekker than Frank Peretti."
4,Another Winner,"When hearing that Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker teamed up to co-write a new novel, I couldn't wait to purchase. I own both of their complete collections and am never disappointed. For the casual reader, this thriller offers quite a ride. I read it in an afternoon because I found myself carrying it around the house while chasing small children. It even ended up on the kitchen island while cooking dinner. Beyond the energy of the ride though was the element that kept me eagerly turning pages...the point. Frank and Ted write with passion and the stories they tell shine bright on the path of truth. How many thrillers have you ever read that can also highlight incredible grace...in ""one dead body""? Thanks guys for reminding me why the darkness doesn't understand."
1,Underwelmingly Dull,"It takes more than just never ending fight scenes and running through a labrynth in the dark to make a great story. By about half way through the book I was weary of what was reading like a cheap first person shooter.I know that Frank Peretti is capable of so much more depth of character and richness of description. There was so much more in the characters that could have been develolped. They could have expanded on their pasts and brought them convincingly to an understanding of sin.There were also way to many scenes in the book with people trying to decide if they should kill each other or not. It got really, really dull."
5,good book a must buy,"this was a good book, but a little scary for anyone under thirteen. if you're wondering whats in it, here are some words to tell you: demons, angels, killers, hounted houses, and a lot of violence."
1,very violent,I love love love Frank Peretti's work. But I hated this book. It was nothing but run from horrible violence. I kept trudging through knowing that Frank would make it all worthwhile. I then started flipping through looking for a change. Nope more violence and running. Till I ended up checking out the ending. I decided that it was time to quit reading. I became worried for Frank.
5,Incredible!,"You will love this! You will have to tell yourself, "" It's only a book, it's only a book!"""
3,Not what I expected...,"As soon as I heard that Peretti and Dekker were doing this book together, I was very excited. I love Frank Peretti, and I have recently begun reading Ted Dekker and like him as well. I thought this book might combine the best of both of their skills.As a horror novel, it is very good. But from Peretti, I expected something with more spiritual significance, something I can learn from. I've gotten that from most of his other novels, but this one is lacking in that regard. One thing Ted Dekker provided that is like his other novels is an unpleasantly quick wrap-up. His novels are great, but they all end way too quickly - this was no exception.The storyline was intriguing and I had a difficult time putting the book down, but in the end I was a bit disappointed."
5,Peretti ROCKED with this one!!!,"I have read all of Peretti's books, with the exception of the ""youth"" series he wrote. I loved them all. He is an awesome suspense/supernatural fiction writer.That said, this book creeped the heck out of me!! I read it in 3 days. I couldn't put it down. I can't tell you how many times I stopped and shivered hard, and literally gasped out loud (my husband, reading next to me, thought I was bananas).Suspense, mystery, who-done-it, hauntings- man, oh man. This made for a book I cannot put down. Frank and Ted certainly are an awesome writing team. I am going to do some research and possibly read some of Ted's books.I can't believe it's over!!! I want to read it again!! :) Seriously, you won't be disappointed. I have never in my life encountered a book like this one."
2,Well...............,"OK, I love Ted Dekker's books. I'm a big fan of the Circle.The thing I see in his work now is that too much is released too fast. Obsessed - Good. Showdown - OK. House - Good idea but, very anticlimatic. I kept reading hoping for some explosive ending but, it just didn't come. I think I should just read the Circle again. I am hoping that he will slow down and take time to put out something that is worthy of the name Dekker."
4,Very exhilarating story,"A sometimes confusing, but always intriguing story. The plot moves well, but sometimes it does seem to lose direction. While there are several frightening passages, the overall tension could have been ratcheted higher, and I confess I expected a little more from such a lofty collaboration. Still, the story was engaging and much better than many other books. I do have questions about some of the implied theology, however."
1,Spend Your Money Elsewhere,"Plain and simple - a bad book. If you don't believe me, go to the bookstore, pick up a copy of House, and spend 15 minutes on it (if you can stand it that long). To really get a feel for the book, open it up and read one page from the center. That's the mess you'll have to deal with for 400 pages. You'll put the book back down and smile that you saved $17.00.I'll never get those hours back."
2,House,"In Mr. Peretti's other books there were plenty of good strongChristian characters that really added to the reading of thebook. The Oath and The Visitation are 2 examples of Mr. Perettiat his best. This book is not one of his best. There is only asmall glimpse of Christian faith in this book and the ""traps""that are found in the house just go on and on and on.....Thebook starts out good with a couple that take the wrong turnonto a rural road. But once they reach The House the adventuregets a little tiring."
2,Um....yeah about that,"First off, im a fan of peretti and dekker but cmon, House was baaad. It was a bible humping mix of Saw and Perettis Nightmare Acadmey. It was a story with so much potential, and tell lost it. The whole Jesus loves you shat is getting old and peretti is to much of a good writer to waste talent on such fantasy. House was bad but I did enjoy reading it."
1,BORING!! Repetitive. Don't Bother!,"I bought this book because Peretti/Dekker were the authors. What a mistake! This is the most repetitive, boring book I have ever read. The only reason I stuck with it is I was hoping it would get better. I haven't decided what to do with my copy yet...I wish I could take it back.This might have been a better short story."
1,This needs a warning label.....for mind numbingly lame.,"I am not a Christian and I will admit that the whole religious aspect did bother me. However, a writer can write what ever or where ever his/her muse takes him. I felt like there was no artistic muse for anything in this book. I would suggest not wasting your time unless it was the last book on earth and there was absolutely nothing else to read, including directions on your DVD player. I was bored but in the interest of fair play I insisted on finishing it....big mistake. I think I lost brain cells. My advice is don't waste your time on a theme that has been done to death and in this case not well. Yawn!!!!"
2,Great Expectations...Poor Delivery,"What can I say...I have read all of Peretti's books and all of Dekker's (except Showdown). I am a big fan of both authors, and was anticipating a great read.What I found was a very shallow story with poor character development. You just never really cared what happened to any of the people in the story. The repetitive action in the house went on forever. This book could have been written in half the pages and not lost anything...there just wasn't that much to it to begin with.To be honest, by the time I was halfway through the story, the only thing that kept me reading it were the author's names on the cover. I thought it would have to get better. I was wrong.Like one of the other reviewers, I felt cheated and let down by what should have been a dynamic collaboration between two very creative Christian authors."
3,Not so bad until you hit the end,"Haunted house with jacked up hosts and an ultimatum that pushes the limits of two couples who never met before. Most of the story in House was enjoyable and kept me reading, but then you reach the end and can't help but feel dirty, because it was cheap and unexciting. Despite the lackluster ending, I would recommend reading this book. It provides some creepy characters and often keeps you burning through the pages to see where it goes. A movie of the same name was made based on the book and was mostly faithful, but you're better off reading the book."
3,A disappointing page-turner,"I am a fan of Frank Peretti's books (I had never read anything from Dekker before this), but I felt ""House"" was seriously lacking in character/story development. Usually books are much better than the movies that are made of them, but it seems as if this book was written for a movie and was lacking in the details and set-up that I enjoy in some of Peretti's other books. I'm not sure who did what, if it was Dekker, Peretti, or the combination of the two that just made this book a flop.It was a page-turner as far as keeping my attention, but definitely not on my list for quality writing."
5,another Dekker masterpiece.,"This is one of the most fun, and most confusing, books that I have ever had the privilege of reading in all of my life. Ted Dekker IS the best writer alive today. For all those out their saying Stephen kings better, wake up stupid. While Dekkers turning out books like Showdown and House, King is giving us books like Cell. Their is no comparison. Don't listen to any of the other reviews of this book on Amazon, they don't have any idea what their talking about. This book is simply great. And for those of you those don't believe me, get the book and read it. It will only take about one day to finish it. The only problem I have is that this Frank Peretti guy seemed to be holding Dekker back. Their was non of the edge of your seat suspense that is what makes Dekkers books SOOOOOOOO great.Overall House is MUCH better than obsessed but doesn't quite add up to Thr3e or the Circle trilogy. But if you haven't read any Dekker books, this is a good one to start on."
1,Disappointment!,"I don't even have the energy to critique this book. I LOVE Peretti books, so when I saw it at Borders I bought it. I agree that the characters were not developed, nor was there enough explanation. When I got to the end and saw that a movie is coming out, I realized this seems like just a rough draft screen play, undeveloped and not fleshed out. I personally don't like just hacking and blasting, shooting and chopping things or people, so this book was tedious to get through because that's almost all that was happening! I kept reading, thinking it would come together but it never did. The spiritual allegory wasn't even clear enough. Anybody want to buy a used copy?"
4,A Roller Coaster of a Book!,"What is the result when you pair two of Christian thrillers greatest authors? House. At it's base, this book is really about spiritual warfare, and being blind to truth. The books message is very strong, and it is delivered in an extremely entertaining way. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of five, was because very often I became VERY annoyed with the characters. I think most people will find a couple of the characters to be downright intolerable, but nevertheless, the good rules out over the bad, and this book is definately worth a read."
2,Help! Let me out of the house!!,"Help! Let me out of the House!! No, not because it's such a scary masterpiece. But because it is boring, poorly developed, and extremely lacking in character depth and development.Which one is Jack? Which one is Susan? Who cares?I never connected with any of the characters, and I was glad to get through this book. Truth be told, I skimmed the last three or four chapters just to be able to ""finish"" the book. I was largely disappointed in what could have been a very good book.And, the Christian theme was rather poorly developed, as was the whole of the book. I say jeers to Peretti and Dekker on this let-down of a corroboration."
2,Surprisingly Disappointed,"As a longtime fan of Frank Peretti, I was very surprised at how little I enjoyed this book. I gave it two stars instead of one only because it wasn't bad enough for me to not finish it, but the characters lacked depth, the story lacked development..and while I have never read any of Dekker's work, this was definitely sub-par for Peretti."
5,Picture of Salvation,"I have yet to review any book of the hundreds and hundreds I've read, that should tell you a little about how much I enjoyed this book. Not only was it on the edge and entertaining, but I IDENTIFIED with the characters, and the sacrifice of the girl made me CRY! Not with sadness but with sincere agony for my part in the story. I can't wait for the movie!"
1,Pure Unrealistic Crap.,"This book has some of the most unrealistic characters I have ever had the misfortune of reading about. People just do not act that way. And the end! Lets just get on our knees and pray for all the baddies to go away! God does not work that way. Not scary, by a long shot either. If I could give it less than one star I would."
2,Expected more...,"Mildly disappointing:Character development lacked detail and depth. Also, I was not aware this was a ""Christian fiction"" writing, until I read the acknowledgement page.Still, it was a good story-line, but lacked the edge or depth of a King or Koontz. I guess if you like ""soft horror"" this would be good stuff for you."
1,Disappointing,"Am a fan of Peretti and Dekker, but this book was obviously co-written without alot of continuity and seemed very disjointed. Difficult to follow with the setting continually changing and the ""moral of the story"" was unclear. Character development was spotty and I had more questions at the end, than at the beginning. Skip this one."
3,Worth Reading,I am a reader of both writer's and was really looking forward to this book. But....it does make you feel a bit like your running around in circles(mentally)not good when your the reader. My 16 year old son read it and really liked it. I encourage you to read both of the writers other works and lets pray they write alone next time.
3,Pretty Good,"One reviewer wrote that people either loved this book or hated it and there was no in between. Well, there is now. I thought the book was okay. I liked it but it wasn't anything great! It entertained me and was an easy read. I liked the Christian aspect to it. I guess my biggest complaint is that what makes a great horror, thriller, or supernatural book, is that the author somehow, no matter how far-fetched and outrageous it may seem, somehow can make it seem believable. That is what makes a book scary...just a slight hint of believability. Anyone who has read any of Stephen King's early novels know this. His line in Salem's Lot...""Our unbelief in vampires is their source of survival."" He made you doubt what you knew to be 100% true. In this book, it was a story but nothing made me believe in the characters or doubt what I know to be true. It is worth reading if you are a fan of the authors, but it isn't one that I will remember for long."
2,A Disappointing Read,"As an avid Ted Dekker Fan, I am disappointed in the quality of the story told. Though the book has many of the characteristics of a Dekker book I have come to expect. This one lacks the edge of the seat trading it for the wonder and confusion. Mr. Dekker has always presented a gospel message in a special and unique way in his fiction. This one comes short and uses characterizations that do not complement scripture but confuse it. The character in particular is Susan, if this was to represent Christ I am bewildered. If not, I do not understand her role. I like Peretti as a writer, but feel that he may have influenced some of the parts that make the story confusing not challenging.Give me Blink or Three, my favorite Dekker books or even Showdown but keep this one.Mr. Dekker and Mr. Peretti need to keep writing but not collaborate."
4,Great fictional portrayal of John 1:5,"This story is an incredible modern-day parable. Somewhere around the middle it started to seem like it was just dragging on, but then the plot started moving--no, racing--toward an amazing climax. The best part of the book is the very end, where everything starts to make sense and the spiritual dimensions are made clear. The ending is the best part! I spent a week reading this book, and that same week I happened to be studying John 1:5. Little did I know that the story was spun from this verse! For those who are not fainthearted, House could be excellent material for a Bible study group. Check out Westbow's Reader's Guide. I hope that Peretti & Dekker team up again soon!"
1,Ugh.,"I rarely write reviews, but have to toss one out on this book - to WARN POTENTIAL READERS AWAY!! Trite plot, unlikeable characters, hackneyed dialogue, dragging pace... this one has it all. I agree that one star is too much! On my personal little reading list, I have actually given this one a -5. At least I borrowed it from the library instead of spending money. Whew!"
1,Possibly the Worst Novel Ever,"I was looking so forward to reading this book because I had heard so much about Frank Peretti's work. I have no idea who Ted Decker is and now have no interest. The following are the reasons I disliked this novel.1. There was absolutely no character development. One character was the same as the other, even boy vs girl, and I couldn't develop a single feeling for any of them. I was disappointed, when at the end, they all weren't dead.2. There was way too much action. someone was always leaping, running, zipping along, shooting or stabbing. You got worn out on each page.3. For a horror novel, there was absolutely no atmosphere, I thought I was reading a facebook entry.4. Sketchy plot. Even though I got it, it was totally trite. I had to force myself to read the book and it was a totally dull experience."
3,A little too twisted to unravel,"There's no doubt that Peretti and Dekker did an excellent job of creating atmosphere in this book. I still feel dirty and smell those musty, moldy rooms when I think about it. I wish they had really dug into the characters more - into their feelings I mean. I think we were supposed to generate some of that from the hints they gave us, but I wanted to see and feel it not just guess about it. Overall, it seemed that the story was so caught up in scaring or shocking me that it lost the deeper meaning the authors were striving for. I guess it was like swatting a fly with a sledge hammer. In the midst of the shattered wall, I couldn't remember what was being swatted. I'm hoping some of these things will be resolved in the movie for those who may want to risk seeing it."
4,House,"WOW! This is a weird and creepy story, and comparable to any Stephen King novel. The action starts right at the beginning of the book and continues to the end. This is not my favorite Peretti book, but I found it well written; typical of Peretti. I would recommend this and all of Frank Peretti's books."
2,meh,"When I started reading this book I would've given it 5 stars, the story was good and it really had me on edge. Then they brought religion into it and that's where I lost interest. I finished reading it because I bought the book but the ending left a lot to be desired. I won't read anything else by the author."
3,It was ok..,"HouseBy Ted Dekker ad Frank PerettiMr. White has issued a challenge the people inside of a seemingly innocuous inn after stranding the four there, if they do not kill one among them then he will kill them all so goes this story making the people inside face their own demons. Set in backwoods Alabama the strangers face in breeds who are trying to sacrifice them to Mr. White and being trapped in a maze underneath a haunted house. Can they keep true themselves, or will the survival instinct kick in and force them to do the unthinkable?This book was definitely different I enjoyed the mix of supernatural with psychological unfortunately the book itself was too predictable. From the very beginning I knew what was going on and who Mr. White was I was hoping I would be surprised so I kept reading when it turned out that every new ""twist"" was exactly as I predicted I was thoroughly disappointed. It was a fun read and the suspense was palpable but do not get your hopes up."
1,"Peretti, you failed my high expections!","I've loved some of Peretti's past novels, including The Oath. I've even had a book signed by him and found him to be a really nice guy. But as many other reviewers have stated, this one is just a nasty horror -- I was ""horribly"" disapppointed. Sorry Peretti."
2,Did not enjoy this book,"I was hoping for a riveting, scary read but was highly disappointed. The story was so truly unbelievable that I just couldn't wait to finish it. I didn't feel any connection at all with the characters, and the story just seemed to drag on and on with way too many twists and turns."
4,2 of my favorite authors!,"I am not big on horror in general, but loved the metaphor in this book! You get in the house and then can't get out - a real page turner. I won't be letting my 14 year old daughter read it yet, as it's a bit intense and graphic for her (she has nightmares easily). Otherwise, a hit!"
4,Great!,"This was a great read. I've never read anything of Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker, and now I'm looking forward to reading more of their material. I just could not stop reading until I got to the end. It took me two days to complete and it was worth every page."
1,Not a very good book,"I love Ted Dekker's and Frank Peretti's books, so when I saw that they had collaborated, I was really excited. However after I finished this book, I was really disappointed. I finished the book only because I wanted to see how it turned out. The story was disjointed, confusing, and I didn't connect with any of the characters. I kept waiting for the message of hope that I have always found in the books by both of these authors, but it was so vague that I almost missed it. If you were to ask me if you should read this book I would say, don't waste your time."
1,Hated it.,This book was very poorly written. I've read online fan fiction better than this. Written by teenagers.
3,Intriguing,"This was a page turner. They did a good job with the description, some parts are really creepy.The ending, however, wasn't too good."
1,Disappointing,"I love Frank Peretti's ""This Present Darkness"" and so I thought I'd try House because the story idea sounded interesting. I got this from the library--glad I didn't pay to read it. I thought the story was repetitive and through the second half of the story I was confused about who was who, who was real, who was doing what, etc.I agree with what a lot of the other readers have said--if you want to read this, borrow it."
4,Yes! Learning Korean,"Received it by the date estimated. I wish this book had a DVD with it, so I can sound out the letters but I'll keep looking online for other books once I finish reading this one. Thank you!"
4,uncle john's : the next generation,"Remember Uncle John's bathroom reader? That gift to those of us who enjoy a linger longer than a PEOPLE magazine article. Well, mixologist, amateur aesthetitician and pithy guy T.E. Krieger seems to have taken on the rather large task of telling us what we need to say at cocktail parties, the bulk of which are drab boring affairs where the goal is usually to see how long can one last, that or who one can leave with.But actually what he seems to have done is to give a scattershot glance at enough disciplines to make even the least well-read out there passably informed on the basics (philosophy, art, literature, film...) and when mixed with an average intelligence and a little humility might actually add something to your run of the mill cocktail banter. That, or given us some good light reading for the john.Think of it as NPR meets Howard Stern with a little too much Dennis Miller thrown in..."
5,incredible...,This CD is so beautiful....I have listened to it over and over--and I it just moves me so much-i wish more music were like this..
5,Wonderful Photographs!,"Dr. Wiggins has assembled an outstanding collection of photographs, as well as commentaries on dozens and dozens of Confederate soldiers from totally unknown men of the ranks to well known subjects. Not only can the historian or reenactor gain much from the details of the uniforms and weapons but we all have the opportunity to look into the eyes of men long gone who marched off to a horrifically brutal war. Images of the men at reunions decades after the war show us old men who lived with the wounds, amputations and memories of what they had done in their youth. A remarkable book preserving these men for all time.Hugh T. Harringtonauthor of: ""Civil War Milledgeville, Tales From the Confederate Capital of Georgia,"" ""Remembering Milledgeville, Historic Tales From Georgia's Antebellum Capital"" and ""More Milledgeville Memories."""
4,Nice History,My ancestors were George Confedrates so it is nice to have this little book in my possession. It appears well researched and presented.
5,Corelle Coordinates Abundance 6-Piece Large Bowl Set,"I love these bowls. They are so pretty , you can store stuff in them and also use on the table."
4,Great story with adventure,"When I ordered this book I wasnt sure what the story was about. It is a well written story about a young man, in the crossroads of his life who after a family death takes the surf trip he has dreamed about all his life in Mexico. On the trip he meets a girl and the adventure begins.I really enjoyed the travel in this story, the author made the story and places really come alive with a lot of real emotions."
2,SURF YES STORY NO,Chris H. obviously has a deep love for surfing and knows how to get da kine across.Swell.where's the sunburn?where's the real Mexico?
4,Solid album.,"Pretty good acoustic rock album. Pretty reserved compared to some of his other stuff, but a solid piece of work. If you like Joseph Arthur, you should buy this album."
5,"Of singer/songwriters, Best of '06","Was a bit skeptical of buying this album given that I was not thrilled with the ""Come to Where I'm From"" album (except for In the Sun, Chemical), but I was sold with Black Lexus on a Paste CD and Slide Away on Letterman. Thankfully, of the singer/songwriters, probably the best album since Josh Rouse's Nashville ... both smooth albums, although the similarities end there. Enough to Get Away makes you smile with every listen, and some fine strumming underlies most of the other songs. The album will not likely disappoint."
5,"Bright teeth, no problems","Good product. Works overnight. I use it inside my invisalign braces overnight. Not to be used 2 days in a row however. It's too strong, but the white lasts a while. I definitely recommend this. Good price too, and you can avoid the dentist visit upcharge for a similar product."
3,Interesting book,This book isn't by Joseph Campbell but rather a compendium of his talks with narration by one of his followers. I found the book hard to follow and not particularly to my tastes.
3,Not really what I was looking for.,"Seems to get to involved with detail. Maybe just not interesting details for me. Some of the history,seems to be rambling."
5,A great start on your journey to Joe Campbell & your bliss!,"This is a great introduction to, or summation of, Campbell's works. Most of his works are extreemly deep and can be difficult to reach but well worth the effort. If you really want to probe the deapths of Campbell's work but are intimidated by his other books, this will give you a great overview and fire your desire to dig deeper.I have read all of Campbell's books. The amount and breadth of the information and thier implications is staggering. The most amazing thing about this book is that I would have chosen almost exactly the same summative material for this type of book as did Osborn. My background is steeped in science--Osborn's in poetry. Yet we found the same ""song of the universe"" within Campbell's works.Why? Because the song is transparent to the transendent and there for the everyone."
2,Disappointed,"Reads like random ideas and notes from a working file and not a book that you can't put down. It is more of a published work in process and not a finished cohesive work, the kind that we came to expect from Campbell."
1,Watch out for this Atheist,A warning to all Christians. This man is an atheist and writes for them. Stay away and believe God's word.
5,The Divine Lives Within You,It is helpful if the reader already has an appreciation for the author's breadth and depth of understanding of mythology before beginning A JOSEPH CAMPBELL COMPANION. It is particularly useful if one is familiar with Campbell's belief that certain mythic motifs are found in virtually all of the world's traditions.Much of A JOSEPH CAMPBELL COMPANION is written in the easy conversational style of the author . It is highly readable and relies very little on scholarly jargon.The parts of the book I find most interesting are those pages devoted to a discussion of Buddhism and the relevance of some of its teachings for all of us.
5,The Book I Quote Most Often,"I know of no set of readings produced in the 20th Century that can so certainly be read again and again with new life during every reading. Just the set of quotations from Campbell at the beginning of the book are worth its price. Buy the hardback, ribboned edition for you will be reading and referring to this volume again and again."
5,books to live by,"Normally avoiding these types of ""companion"" works, I usually prefer the complete books and/or essay collections of such seminal thinkers as Campbell.Not so in this case. This work proves to be an elegant, comprehensive tour of the mind of the really important J.C.I was surprised to come across as many typos as I did, but this did not terribly distract from an otherwise awesome book, certainly not enough to avoid giving it a five-star rating."
2,A bitter disappointment for a diehard fan,"I am perhaps the biggest Gunsmoke fan ever- have watched all episodes dozens of times. This attempt at a Movie however was horrible, very disappointing and to be truthful, quite shameful. I felt really bad for James Arness for being forced to participate in this drool. And poor Miss Kitty- what can I say. Don't watch this or you will see these actors very differently- forever."
4,For Gunsmoke fans,We are still watching reruns of Gunsmoke on tv so enjoyed seeing the characters in the movies and scenes from past shows. The only problem I had with the movie was too much violence and not enough of a good story line.
2,"Gentry, please!","Tell the story! Don't bore me to death with details. This was a waste of time, in my estimation. No continuity, no real story line, little value."
1,"""Devastatedly disappointed"" is too mild","I am sad to tell you that you should not waste your time. I waited many months after the promised printing date, every week harrassing the people at the book store, trying to figure out when this book would be out. I felt betrayed at the partial development of characters only to have them vanish with minimal effort and suspense. This was not science fiction. Lee was trying, very unsuccessfully, to show the struggle a human has with identifying his place in the universe with the concept of GOD and God's place. These issues were touched on briefly inbetween crisis' almost as an after thought. I choose this and his previous book due to my love of Rama series. I feel robbed and deceived."
1,This was same author of Bright Messengers & Rama Books?,"This book was a great disappointment. I had eagerly awaited the sequel to Bright Messengers. Although the author delves into the life of Johann quite throughly, it was really disgusting to read about his almost incestious relationship with his surrogate daughter, Maria. I also felt that I was being emotionally jerked around by Mr. Lee, who seemed to capriciously kill his characters by placing them in situations that were meaningless and stupid. Please, Mr. Lee, no more sequels; give it a rest."
2,Very disappointed given the wait for this sequel.,"Disappointment in the extreme! After waiting three years for Double Full Moon Night, I was let down by the lack of clarity on what the entire story line means. I expected some ruminations about God or our place in the cosmos, and all I got was a long list of characters placed in plots that did little to serve the story. If you read Bright Messengers, you should read this book to catch up with Johann and the others, but don't expect a lot of insights, only amusing short stories with throw-out aliens and animals."
4,I found this book an excellent read!,"I really enjoyed both books. I think I am the only one in the universe who has not read the Rama series, so for me, Lee's books were excellent. I started reading the first and as soon as I finished, I went right out and bought the second one. The only parts I did not enjoy was the extra time spent describing the religious aspects and switching from one generation to the next. I loved the different settings and I never knew what was coming next! I am putting Mr. Lee down as an author that I will read anytime!"
2,Dissapointing sequel,"I, unlike many other Rama readers, thought that Bright Messengers was a great book. Even though the reader didn't fully understand everything at the end, I was very excited knowing I would find out how humans got in the octospider colony inside Rama. I though BM preserved the sense of mystery that Clarke & Lee created so well together. However, I was very dissapointed with Double Full Moon Light. In his previous books, Lee seemed to explore the workings of the inner mind almost as much as he did create an outer scientfic world. In short, I found the characterization shallow, and the main characters had so many different forgettable offspring that I nearly threw the book across the room after trying to relate them back to Johann. Oh well, I'll just view this as a quick slump for Lee. I hope his next book is as good as Bright Messengers was."
2,Utter Rubbish... With Some Redeeming Qualities!,"Rama was great. This wasn't. It spent too much time going over and over what had happened in the previous chapters and even the previous book. Sure some reflections and reminders were required but surely not on every page! This book should have focussed on Maria's encounters with the Octospiders, but Lee's lack of forsight prevented that. On the plus side there were some excellent creatures with interesting lifecycles presented that provide moments of compelling reading. Actually this book does show that there was a lot of loose ends left at the end of the Rama. Lee would do well to write a collection of short stories tying up those loose ends as well as the ones in this story. The novel wasn't very satisfying, but it was interesting (except for the repetitive bits). Buy this if you brought the first and the Rama novels but don't expect a sense of overwhelming relevation. It just doesn't happen."
4,Old SciFi,"Very nicely done. This was the second book. This is old s/f, and I found it enjoyable reading.The way I know that, is, I bought this book. Book #1 was ""Bright Messengers"". I enjoyed the old s/f so much, I had to get this sequel. I suggest if your a fan of old S/F, you'll dig these books."
4,"Good strategy w/o spoilers, w/ ONE BIG ANNOYANCE","OK, it's an official guide so you can expect that it will have all the standard ""secrets"" and tricks. As far as strategy guides go it is a good one, BUT I can't understand why they made up details about the characters which are not supported in the game itself and do not come from any of the original Japanese source material. Big Boss a 3rd generation Japanese American? What a crock of ****."
3,A welcomed addition to any book collection,"Although there have been several disappointing reviews of this book I personally found it informative from several points. First off my father was a crew member on B-24 Liberators and this gave me an insight as to how a ""Liberator"" crew flew their missions. As far as being to technical and boring I didn't find it so, there are some missions that were ""Milk Runs"" but the author points these out prior to reading them and makes up for them with experiences he and his crew had while not flying combat missions. This is also the first book I have read that mentions the ""Davis Wing"", which I personally found very informative."
1,The most boring WWII book I have ever read.,"I was hoping that a ""forbidden diary"", written as the action happened, would be very interesting. It wasn't. I am sure the author went through some hairaising experiences, cheating death on every mission. I just wish he had told the reader about them. Instead, we get a very technical description of the airplane written in a boring style. His Editor should have known better. That's why we buy these books...to get a feel of how it really was. Unfortunately, the description of his missions felt no more exciting than a commercial flight between New York and Chicago. ""We went up, dropped the bombs, then came down."" Wild stuff."
3,dvd,This is his older work from the early 90's. If you are looking for recent work this is not your dvd.
2,ok,"good sun blocker; however, too much pressure on each side of the head. give me a headache after a while."
4,Banish the black hole in your bag!,"For the first time in my life my purse actually looks as good on the inside as it does on the outside! I love this organizer; there are enough little pockets to hold all the bare essentials, especially the smaller items that usually get lost in the vortex that is/(was!) my purse. No more! There are pockets for pens, lippies, cell phones, keys, etc. I can't comment on the purse light as I still need to get the batteries for that. I only wish there were more color choices for the Purse Brite; the tan/beige is a bit bland, but as it will never see the light of day, I guess it doesn't matter.For those wanting to save a few bucks, Bed Bath & Beyond sells this for the low price of $9.99 (with their 20% off coupon mailer, it's a steal)."
1,Don't even bother,This was probably the worst purchase I have EVER made. The quality was not what was presented...I ordered an extra light and never received it. I took almost 2 1/2 months to get it AFTER my card was charged. I tried to give it no stars but the option was not available.
2,Purse Brite from As Seen on TV,"I received the Purse Brite and did not like it. I prefer the original manufacture of these bag organizers. I tried to return mine and never received a response from TV Guys in order to return. It is requested that a RMA be given and after countless emails, had no success. They only allow 15 days to return and my 15 days were up trying to receive a response from them, which did not occur. I was unhappy with the product and extremely unhappy with the so-called ""service"" of TV Guys."
3,Not what I expected,"I didn't find this product as useful as I had hoped. It does not replace the wallet, as I had hoped it would, and it takes up more space in the purse than I thought, requiring a larger purse than I usually carry. Otherwise, it appears to be good quality."
4,Hello! Hooray!,"If you are an Alice Cooper fan (and I know you are). then this is one of the shirts you'll want to add to your Alice cooper shrine. The shirt of course features Alice in a straight Jacket flailing around and his name on the front and back. This is a great picture of ALice at his craziest and the blood dripping font is nice and scary. However it just feels like the back is missing something. But if you are an ALice cooper fan, or just a psycopath your gonna want this t shirt."
5,Doors opening over and over again,"Being a guitar tutor myself and having experience of tutorial DVDSi must say i was pleasantly surprised when i purchased this dvdDoug is natural at presenting and explaining his ideas... whilst Grade books lead to in a similar direction, Doug is very structured and makes sure you understand everything, step by step.i thoroughly recommend this title, i will be passing on information to my pupils and even starting a course based around this Dvd, for experienced players.you do need a good understanding to get the most from his lessonsits intense but very very rewardingits opened many doors, in my improvising and teachingi ordered direct from 411,the customer service was excellentand you can email doug if you need to...5 stars excellent and a great new approach via the satch / doppler methodmiss this and you will regret it!!!"
2,"interesting book, but.....","This is not a comprehensive study of eunuchs and castrati in India. I was deeply disappointed when I received the book. Therefore , I don't recommend it. That's all.But, if you are interested in hijras , it's not so bad idea to purchase this item."
4,This is not your fathers Aqualung,"I bought this in the middle of a cross country trip with my daughter and only got to give it one cursory listen in between Ashanti and whatever the other stuff was she was listening to. When I got home it sat on my shelf for several weeks until I finally got it out last week. Verdict-surprisingly good if you can forget the original.The sound is much more like Thick As A Brick than the original disc. Martin Barre still plays excellent electric guitar, but several of the songs are much more acoustic driven. This is most notable on Hymn 43 which was always a personal favorite. This adds depth to songs like the title track. Locommotive Breath is excellent and Wind Up finishes it beautifully.The additional stories and discussion have been moved to the end of the disc and cast some light on the discussions we had about Tull and religion 35 years ago as well as the making of the record itself.Highly recommend this disc, if you think you can accept it for what it is"
1,Wretched,"I'm a huge fan of Tull and I own almost the entire catalog. There are many albums that still blow me away: Benefit, Minstrel in the Gallery, Stormwatch. Even Roots to Branches and J-Tull dot com were very decent releases.Aqualung Live, however, is abysmal, for one reason: Ian Anderson's voice is absolutely terrible on the album. Just unbelievably bad. He sounds like Popeye gasping for wind after a 100-yeard sprint. He's behind the beat, can't hit any high notes and sings in a nasally wheeze.I realize he's an older gentleman and I don't expect him to have the pipes of a 20-year-old. But the singing ruins the album (which does showcase some interesting reinterpretations of the music).Anyway, I could never recommend this to anyone. Try something in the catalog that's unheralded like Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll or Underwraps."
5,Aqualung Live (and Kicking),"You have to be a certain age to remember Aqualung being one of the albums you had to be seen with when it was first released. Those of you below 40, ask your folks. So, I had the original on vinyl, then on CD and found this version - fantastic! All the songs are there but improved recording techniques and the energy from a live recording make it perfect, a must have for any Jethro Tull fan. The tracks that do it for me, the small audience and probably the band are Aqualung, Locomotive Breath and Wind Up - closely followed by all the others. In addition, the CD includes wonderful bonus sound bites from the band. It's one to pass down to the kids."
3,"I'm sorry But..,","With deepest regret, I am being generous by giving this CD a 3 star rating. I'm a Jethro Tull junkie. It is quite possible I have been listening to them on a daily basis for over 30 years. This remake of Aqualung with a live feel to it, is borderline boring. There is no passion in the playing. Ian's throat problems have returned making his voice pretty shoddy. And a few of the new arrangements are just so so. I recently saw them in concert early October and Ian's voice was even worse. They gave this CD as a freebie. I'm so dissapointed I am ending this review momentarily. I guess, just making an attempt to recreate some early magic is worthy of this recording but.., Ah forget it. All this being said Jethro Tull is still the greatest musical group of the century. Even on a bad night, they are more entertaining and have more talent in their little pinkies than 99% of the perfomers who make it popular today. Buy the CD anyway, if your a fan. The money is going to a great cause."
5,How to live the Christian life in Victory,This is a fascinating book about how the reality of the spiritual battle going on all around us effects everything in our world and how we NEED to be educated about it and be participating so we can live in victory and be effective in our prayer life and the way we live. It imparts an understanding about the way our world looks and works that makes sense but you just have not probably thought of things this way before. I highly recommend watching or listening to the video/audio series that goes along with each chapter in this book as it will expand your understanding significantly. Highly recommended.
1,They don't honor what they promisse,"I placed the order of this book on the 19th of this month, and it was on the 24th i got an email that they will be shipping my item. I'm honestly pretty upset about the time that im going to get my item. And how slow they were to respond to my purchase. They specifically wroted that they usully ship next day, when i purshase, it was one of the reasons i purchase with them. Well yhis proves that we shouldn' t believe on what they say...."
5,I love these nails,What can you say about nails? These fit my Dewalt cordless finish nailer. I can't find them at the HD store but I can here.
4,Lively Rootsy!,Quality beats that show his dads spirit for the music with a more hip-hop feel. Irie!
5,Best of Ziggy,"This is a great album and full of fun. Ziggy has some great songs that has the spirit of his dad (Bob Marley) in him. This is also a good start for those who haven't heard Ziggy before and the song selection is great too. Down the road, I have a feeling we'll be seeing more greatest hits albums, but for right now, this is a great album to enjoy. It's a fun album and an easy listen for reggae lovers or music lovers in general."
2,TV died after 18 months,"I really liked this TV until about 18 months of ownership. I was watching a recorded show, heard a click from inside the unit and the screen went black. It still had sound, but the screen just went black - all inputs were also showing no picture!"
1,TERRIBLE Horns,I installed these on my car. They are pathetic! They may be WORSE than the anemic horns I replaced with these. I wouldn't recommend these to my worst enemy. I checked the horn relay (replaced it). I made certain I had good grounds and full 12 volts to the horns. Still the sound is a really sorry warble. Garbage!
4,Great horns,"I installed these on my 87 Toyota pickup and man do they sound good! They are not too high in pitch and not to low, they are just right! But i do wish they were alittle louder, but they are definitely 10x louder than the stock horn! now i finally dont feel embarrassed to honk my horn! Installing was easy, took about 30 min. the hardest part was finding the perfect spot to put them and i ended up mounting them on the inside of the fender, one on each side. i would recommend these as they are cheap and sound good!"
3,Not what I was hoping for,"I wanted a horn to be deeper than my whinny Japanese Subaru horn. wee, wee. I was embarrassed honking that horn. Even though this horn is a lot better, I still feel the higher frequency horn still overpowers the lower one and still gets that beep beep sound instead of the honk honk sound. If you want a deep sounding horn, look else where."
2,VERY BASIC.,"Good selection of symbols. Just a bit lacking for what I was seeking. Most symbols are available in any clip art program.Not bad, just not what I wanted."
5,Christian Healing,The world would be a better place if we all could agree on the fact that God is the source of all good....including healing. This excellent book helps the reader to see this. It is called Christian Healing but anyone can benefit from this book.
3,It Was Interesting,"This book was interesting to me mostly from a historical context. Eddy is an interesting person metaphysically, with one foot in the healing world, and one foot in the traditional Christian theological world, so her writing always seems to be a mixture of both. However, I do not go to her books when I want information on healing techniques, there are other better sources.."
1,big disappointment to me,"I was so disappointed in this book which I bought based on amazon customer reviews. The title and cover looked good, the reviews were decent, so I bought it. What I got was a small book with small pictures and very few innovative ideas. I've seen it all before. A waste of money."
1,I'm sorry I bought this,"There isn't very much of value in this small book which sounded great but didn't deliver on its promise. The book's size itself is a negative (for the money) and the pictures inside don't look like what the cover promises. The ideas are same-old, same-old. Pretty disappointing."
5,fun and cozy,"I'm moving into my first New York apartment and found all sorts of great and inspiring ideas in this book for every room. Not only was the book helpful, it was also a pleasure to read and to look through. Love the photos. I gave it to a friend at a bridal shower and it was a big hit there with all of its cozy ideas.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to a do a little home improvement, or to anyone interested in design."
4,Think Small,"This is fun for a browse and to get your mind to thinking of uses for all the small spaces in your home. You can create a nook on each side of a fireplace, in a corner of the kitchen, on a wide stair landing, and so on.The book makes liberal use of window seats and daybeds, but there are nooks for all tastes and all occasions. Turkish harem, shabby chic or sleek modern, the book features them all. There are sleeping nooks, dining nooks, play nooks for children, work nooks for adults, and areas just to get away and daydream.I ended up not spending much time on the text, just soaking up the pictures and trying to think of ways to incorporate such cozy spots into our open plan house. She shows ways to create a nook with curtains, shelving and in the bedroom with filmy bed curtains."
4,good,good one but not perfect.the corner of the book is broken.the context of the book is widely covered and so helpful for traffic and highway engineering
3,Bought the Kindle version,Not to be a downer but this left a lot to be desired not only can you only read it on your pc the format isn't that great... Of course this should improve as the media advances and becomes more popular.
1,Brace yourselves,"""Gentle"" is not a word I would associate with this product. I have never had a bad reaction to herbs, dieting, supplements, or even any type of medication before I tried this product. I followed the instructions closely, and three days after starting this programme I could not stand the nausea, fatigue, or intestinal cramping any longer. I stopped using the product, and it took 3 additional days to recover."
1,WARNING - CAUSES NOSE HAIR BURNING ASS BOMBS,"I don't even know if this works, but it is definitely gives me nuclear flatulence. They are the worst smelling farts that have ever been ripped on earth. Once I fart, I'm gagging on the sulfur egg flavor, and whats worse is that the smell lingers for HOURS. Do not buy this product unless you have a thing for nasty butt bombs."
2,Requires other products.,"I havent tried this item yet, when I received it there are instructions saying you need to take other cleansers first.It would have been nice if that was stated before I purchased this..anyway I am using ONE of the other products ""Renew Life Organic Clear Fiber"" for an additional $15.00. So I dont really know how this product works yet."
5,Holds up great to ctough wear.,"We've had this shirt for over a year now, wearing it at a minimum of once weekly. It is stlil bright red and in great shape - we love our Elmo!!"
5,Berenstain Bears - Bears Out and About,"EXCELLENT!!!!!! Just as all Berenstain Bears are, CLEAN, WHOLESOME and TEACH GOOD BEHAVIOR LESSONS!!!!!!!! You can't find better entertainment for your children or grandchildren!!!!!!!! VERY SATISFIED, have many now and WILL buy new ones as they come out. Lee Schrader"
4,Berenstain Bears DVD,"My daughter likes the show on Sprout, this DVD is just like it. I'm glad I got this DVD with several episodes on it. The Berenstain Bears always have a nice lesson in their show. I almost purchased the Christmas DVD, but it was only one episode. This DVD is best value for the money."
1,One little tiny teensy insignificant star without any luster.,"1- I am a long time, long term Toots fan.I have every CD, DVD and musical compilation staring or featuring Toots Thielmans.The only other such attention I have given has been to Bill Evans and Stan Getz. I am a serious Toots fan.2- Cutting to the chase, this CD album stinks. Very little Toots in what seems to be unsuccessful track recordingsand lots of mediocre cuts by various singers, most of whom were listless and bored sounding. Hrold Arlen wastotally trashed in this blatant scam CD..Save your temperment and irritation factors. I trashed it and deleted it from my iPod,Dont polute your ears. Unlistenable gar-BARGHE."
1,Toots showing no signs of road wear,"This is an example of Toots Thielemans' harmonics at their finest. There are some amazing vocal covers of Harold Arlen's compositions, notably ""come Rain or Come Shine"" featuring Lizz Wright and ""Stormy Weather"" with the versatile Oleta Adams bending notes in a refreshing new way. Underneath and buoying up all the vocal pyrotechnics is Toots himself, the spry octogenarian imparting his own imprimature to the American songbook with soaring jazz riffs and flights of fantasy on harmonica."
1,Junk - a waste of money.,"This unit tests almost all batteries as ""good"" - even when I know there is nothing left in them. Don't waste your money!"
2,"OK, but not at all accurate...","I have found this tester to give false readings. I had a flashlight that was almost dead (bulb was barely lit), when I tested the batteries using this tester, it said they were good. I have found this to be the case on several occasions. For just a couple bucks more, Radio Shack has better testers."
3,OK.. product,"Purchased this and it arrived on time. The device looks and feel Ok. When use the device, I was able to track down the correct wire. However, I did experience the signal bleed. Meaning when you set signal to a wire, other wires next will pickup a signal also. You had to find the signal that is the strongest.Ran to Lowes and HomeDepot one day and notice similar devices for about the same price or little less expensive. Had me think twice, did i get the best value for the product?"
2,Tone generator and amp probe,"This is not a very good item at all,very disappointed with it, thought it would work a lot better for the $100 I paid for it!!"
3,Inexpensive and good for basic usage,"Or if your budget is tight. You need to be close to the wire to get the tone with the probe (a few milimeters) but it allows you to pinpoint exactly which wire you're trying to find. If you are a professional that will rely heavily on it, go with something a little higher end but for occasional tracing, this will be a good product."
3,"Fair quality, lack of information",This kit is designed for old PSP systems. The screen protector does not fit very well the PSP slim so you might probably have to give it to a friend. The car charger is very useful and the case is OK. Cheap price for an OK product. Don't expect a great quality kit
3,Good Book,"Well written with to the point advice on the vagaries of golf war. However, a little short on pages for the price."
1,"Would not buy it again, even if they paid me to take it.",This solar floating light-----can't float. Takes on water and sinks to the bottom of the pool on the vinyl liner leaking battery acid!
1,old time country album by tejano singer,"My husband enjoys listening to this artist who he's seen in person. It's okay by me, but not especially high quality."
5,"Informative, great pictures","Kings of the Road : A Pictorial History of Trucks is informative and has great pictures. It goes back to the beginning of motorized travel and brings the reader up to the late 90s. If you get goosebumps when seeing a powerful Mack or a sleek Freightliner, give this book a read."
4,This is a tight record that you need....,"Big Mike is hittin hard and deliverin knockout punches with quality anthems such as 'Burban and impalas and All a dream.I think this is solid record that rap fans need.Almost every song has bright spots even the so called not good songs,The reality is that even the not so good songs are better than most...in the flooded rap community."
1,Not Serious!,"I liked Big Mike's first cd (cassette) which was entitled ""Serious"" and it was hott. But this one is not serious at all. I would not suggest purchasing it or even downloading it. Save your time and money. YMMV.....NEOSOUL06."
3,German Scnitzel mix and other German cooking aids.,Good service from the company I procured my order from.We enjoy the german aids as we spent over 20 years in Germany and these small editionsbring good memories to our table.
5,Insane,"Any album that begins with a low growling scream is going to be brutal and this album is no exception. Both bands are agressive to their hearts content. There's not much more I can say about this except that if you care at all about heavy music you'll buy this and also Burnt By the Sun's ""Soundtrack to the Personal Revolution"" or Luddite Clone's ""The Arsonist and the Architect""."
3,Hangul Reference Book,"This book provides a very well written description of the Korean alphabet (Hangul), developed in 1446. In provides phonetic instructions and etiology. This book also provides various translated pleasantries and salutations, but is weak in this area.I found the book very useful and enjoy using it as a reference. Non-Koreans who have need of learning some Korean will find this helpful. Additionally, the book is oriented somewhat towards Taekwon-Do curricula, so many people who have an interest in martial arts will also find this book helpful."
2,Neglected for a Reason,"a really disappointing collection of ""neglected"" tales of terror. there's a reason these tales were originally neglected.a couple of decent stories but not worth buying."
4,A Nice Collection,"As one could expect in an anthology, some of the stories are better than others but overall pretty good. There is also a wide range of styles; from comedic to morbid, there is more here than just traditional Victorian ghost stories (but there are a few of those too).Guy de Maupassant's ""The Tomb"" stands out as possibly the most disturbing of lot. It is very short, more of a micro story, but what it is lacking in length is more than made up for in content."
1,"Dry, dry, dry",This is strictly a rehash of Pennebaker's (and other's)research. Nothing new here if you've done much reading at all on the topic. Not for the individual looking to use writing in their own life...and not much here for the clinician looking for ways to incorporate writing into your practice.
4,Good product for the price,I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now & can tell that my face has become more smooth. I have sensitive skin too & it does not break my skin out or even cause it to turn red.
3,decent helmet,"Overall ok helmet. A little bigger than I would have liked, but not too heavy. Didn't care for the sunshade feature at first, but have really warmed up to it. Airflow is decent, but visor fogs badly, and doesn't clear easily. Apparently there's an additional anti-fog shield you can attach, but then you've got 3 shields on at once? Clip strap is really convenient, but kind of a pain that you can't lock it to the bike as normal, but can just loop through the strap easy enough I guess. Sizing's ok. Little loose up top and a little tight at the jaw, but I have a tiny head, so it's prob just me. Overall, ok. Price is certainly right."
4,Cute but not durable,"Cute little doll that my daughter likes but ripped easily.. she is a teenager and doesn't exactly ""play"" with her dolls...they just hang out on her bed and dresser."
1,Capone E- A rapper weaker than lil Rob...I couldn't believe it,"CHICANO RAP IS SORRY...I gave it a shot being chicano myself but give me a break. Half the Chicanos I know love lowriders and hanging out but think cholos and all there stupid gang banging is weak and stupid. Then to top it off you get some Paki trying to throw up San Gabriel like its a joke. Yeah fool thats why you are always touring Texas. Overall this album is sorry, its weak, lacks imagination and innovation. It tries to make a sort of gangsta rap chicano style hybrid. I found myself putting my fists together in my chest and dancing like a tecato'd out veterano who can't get any play.Think about it...would any serious rapper consider giving this guy any shared mic time. Puro Compton."
2,A big disappointment,"This book was a big disappointment in that it provides almost no general principles of, or clear guidance for setting up and executing attacks. It is left to the reader to develop and understand attacking concepts from a series of examples from Plaskett's own games. These games often provide good examples of an attacking motif but without meaningful statements distilling the essence of the concepts being displayed I found it difficult to learn from them. Many comments are simplistic, e.g. ""In any attack we must always also consider the safety of our own king,"" others are rather obtuse, e.g. ""When executing an attack be wary of fantastic finishes."" Since I paid for the book I read all of it, but I felt it was mostly a watse of time."
2,"Great games, poor ""Starting Out"" title","As others have remarked, this book is basically a collection of Plaskett's best games. While each of the games presented is spectacular and worthy of publication, a starting out title is simply the wrong venue for them. Plaskett's annotations are patchy, and I found the vast number of moves which passed without comment to be annoying. Furthermore, many of the games featured play best described as speculative! This makes for exciting reading, it functions poorly as instructional material. As a club player, I was looking for direct explanations of simple attacking motifs. This book failed to deliver. Everyman isn't exactly a beacon of quality. Even so, I'm surprised that they let this book out the door with the starting out label."
3,mislabled,this product is not labeled correctly. One would think it was a 1.8 Ghz processor and that they just screwed up and labeled it as 1.8 Mhz. How ever in reality the title they have given this product is all together incorrect. What you will be buying is a Encore Sonnet Duet Dual 1.6 Ghz processor upgrade for the MMD Power Mac G4 or Xserve. The processor you will receive if you purchase this product actually should get a five star rating however I gave it the three star rating because it was not what I expected. I should have read more closely.
4,amatuerish amazon,"the musical sample for junk man,a benny goodman recording in 1933, does not include mildred baileys vocal.Presumably shes the reason for the sample."
4,Wonderfully Written Yet Lacking Somehow,"I do believe that Brasme's novel is very well written, she is very well versed for being 17 at the time it was published. i was rather disturbed at the abrupt ending and there were times that i felt the story lacked some substance. overall i felt it was a good read, i wouldnt recommend it to any teens under the age of 16-the story although not graphic, is rather depressing. Also, Charlene shows no emotion or remorse for her crime and anyone who reads this books and is feeling the same as she (charlene) may not see the danger in committing such a crime as murder. This book also brings to mind ""Queen Bees and Wannabes""-that whole adolescent drama of the popular kids vs. the wannabes...good insight for anyone thinking that teens lack their own distinct personalities...."
5,Brilliant. Could start a whole new music trend.,"Spoken music is the wave of the future. cottonmouth, texas is the best example of this new aesthetic."
5,Loved Fair Haven,Loved the story. It was both interesting and romantic. I could not put the book down. JoAnn Ross writes beautifully. The romance was so tastefully done.
2,Fair Haven,"I usually like this author, JoAnn Ross, but just couldn't get interested in the plot. It didn't seem to flow well and kept jumping from one thing to another. I purchased this kindle book from Amazon where I purchase the majority of my books and am very happy with their service."
4,experience and understand the gospel as a group,"The first few chapters are hard going and it will take a leader experienced with the bible, studying hard to get through but after a little while the book moves on to the heart of the gospel and everyone will be blessed. John Stott writes leading questions that facilitate conversation and lead to easy study."
5,Reference Book for Bible Study,I chose this book for a verse by verse study of the Book of Romans. Priced right so I could provide a copy to each participant.
4,Great story,Great story and the book gets right to the point. Although I'm not so sure about the author's approach on describing the battle by sections or areas as opposed to chronological developments. Nevertheless is great reading for history buffs
3,Lepanto 1571: The Greatest Naval Battle Of The Renaissance (Campaign),"Well done political research.To much weight on artillery ordnance, lacking naval tactics of the time."
4,Great for a clean look,"I've used ventshades on all my vehicles. My current 2007 Camry has a chrome trim around the windows, so the normal stick-on vents would be mounted on the chrome piece. These in-channel vents still adhere with 3M tape, just inside the window channel. The only drawback on these are that the rear pieces do not have lips/tape on the fron edge of them. This allows the ventshade to hang down in the channel a little bit. Unless it's pressed outward while putting the window up, the vent will block the window from going all the way up. I've had these installed now for about a year now and the pieces have never molded themselves into shape enough to not bind. I'm ok with this though, as the rear windows are rarely put down to begin with."
1,auto vent shade,"My son bought the auto vent visors for my 2010 camry xle for christmas and when I opened the box the driver's side vent visor was broken and the the others won't let the windows go up and down without pushing out on the visor as you are rolling up the window. Very expensive and a big waste of 60 dollars, and very disappointed in what was suppose to be a nice christmas present."
3,DECENT,"DECENT. I READ THAT THIS ALBUM WAS MADE USING ONLY AN MPC... AFTER HEARING THE ALBUM, I BELIEVE THIS. BEATS ARE DECENT... BUT YOU COULD GIVE A 5 YEAR OLD AN MPC WITH THE PADS LOADED AND HE COULD MAKE THESE BEATS. NOTHING NEW. MY EARS DID NOT HURT."
3,Should have been titled City Walks: Manhatten,"We've spent a lot of time in NYC, and I can attest from experience that each walk is well worth taking. The format is easy to use, with a master card showing the location of all the walks, and clear directions in the cards.Each card has red circled numbers and letters on the maps, and NO explanation of what the numbers and letters signify. Are they bus and subway numbers? Are they points of interest? I'll figure it out when I'm there next week, but it would be nice to know ahead of time.The boroughs are an important omission. We've been to Manhatten three times, and intend to concentrate on Brooklyn (the 4th most populous city in America, if it was a city unto itself) this trip. Many of the 50 Manhatten walks could be consolidated, to allow 10 walks for Brooklyn, and 5 each for Queens and the Bronx. Brooklyn has Prospect Park and Park Slope, Coney Island, and so much more I'm unfamiliar with."
2,What a disappointment,"The concept was good -- a deck of cards, each with a neighborhood map on one side and walking tour information on the other. Too bad the execution didn't measure up -- focusing more on shops and restaurants that are bound to be gone in a few years and little on neighborhood history and landmark buildings. A smart phone will be of more use than this guide."
2,Waste of time and money,"This is a total waste of your time and money - take 30 minutes online and you can find better recommendations on neighborhoods and areas to visit. Limited directions, bad maps, no logical order to the walks. Glad I didn't pay full price...."
3,Heads Up When Considering This,"I bought this to give as a Christmas gift. It arrived in used condition although it was sold as new. There was no wrapper so when I removed it from the shipping box, the contents spilled. There was a barcode sticker placed over the original barcode on the bottom of the box. As far as I can tell the contents are intact. This is the first time I have received anything from Amazon that was less than expected. I hope you don't have any similar experiences."
1,Warning! Read before buying this card from Amazon!,"I purchased six of the $20 top-up cards from Amazon, for myself and as gifts. I as stunned to find out that the cards, all purchased in December 2004, had expiration dates (not seen until card is removed from package)of 12/31/04. The phones and top-up concept ($20 once every 90 days) are great. Just don't buy the top-ups from Amazon unless you plan to use them up immediately."
1,Amazon selling expired VM cards,"I ordered a $20 and a $30 Virgin Mobile prepaid card from Amazon.com in February 2006. I received the cards one week later; however, both cards had 12/31/2004 expiration dates. Amazon.com customer service was little help, telling me that VM was honoring the cards through 12/31/05 (um, duh, it's 2006). Furthermore, they told me they won't accept a return on the cards because prepaid cards are sold ""as is."""
1,Expired 2 month ago,Ordered on 2/9/05 and received on 2/16/05 which was already expired on 12/31/04.
5,virgin mobile SE47 slider cell phone,This the greatst phone i have ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I used to have another virgin mobile but this one is a lot better. I like the color screen and the ringtones you can buy. I have rintoners by usher and Jay-Z. I also like the sliding action and when you slider the up or down the phone makes a noise. I love the backrounds and the screen savers too. If I could iwould rate this phone over 5 I would rate it to a 9 or 10. You wont regret buying this phone. Even though it cost $150.00 it is definatly worth it. ADVICE: down leave it in your pants or it might get washed!
5,Very Nice Indeed!,"I just recently bought a Virgin Mobile cell phone and I do say- I really love it! Very easy and hassle free. See no acivation fee's, no needing to have your parents involved, etc. And adding money (which leads to more airtime, and Virgin Xtra's) is so simple! Just purchese a top-up card, or register your credit card to their system, and they'll do the rest. It really helped me to learn the value of a dollar, and how to manage a cell phone- especially now that I pay for it all!! :D I'd recommend anyone to get a Virgin Mobile Cell phone- and with all the 'virgin xtras' that you can get, this phone never gets boring! Mine in particular (the Audiovox""Vox"" 8500)is a pretty decent phone.. Compact, sleek, many options, easily handling, etc. Doesnt damage quite easily, and can with stand a lot of the day to day usage I expect from it. I'm surprised that a phone can take some of the stuff it does! Take a look around at www.VirginMobile.com - Maybe Virgin Mobile is right for...you."
1,Card expired,First we received a Virgin Top Up card when we really needed a Tracfone. When we did the search for Tracfone the Virgin Top Up came up which is why we purchased. Since we opened it before realizing the mistake we found that the card had expired. We were told that there was no refund. Then we were told that the card would be honored but when we called Tracfone they said they would NOT honor it. We were told we would get a refund to our checking account. It did not happen. We will NOT purchase anything from Amazon again. Especially since we could go to Dollar General and get the top up card for half the price. The shipping charge from Amazon was ridiculous!
1,Buyer Beware!! Purchase your Top-Up cards elsewhere!,"It thought I was saving time by buying my card online instead of having to go out to the store and get one, but I was WRONG! Don't get me wrong, the phone and cards are great, but be careful if you purchase your Top-Up cards online!! If it takes more than 72 hours between the time you order the card (activated by Amazon at time of purchase/shipping) and the time you receive it, the pin # will ""go cold"" and it shows up as an invalid pin # when you try to top-up. You won't be able to use it without faxing a bunch of information and a copy of the card to Virgin Mobile Customer Service. I went through this recently and it was a real PAIN! I'll be purchasing my cards at my local store from now on."
5,Great way to get minutes,I used Amazon to get Virgin Mobile $20 Top-Up Cards for my Mother that is in a rest home and uses her cell phone when she goes out. She lives 2 towns away and this is a great way to get her this important item before she runs out of mintues.Thanks Amazon!Jay Intagliatawww.level47.com
4,"""Contemporary Soul"" . . . an oxymoron","If every black pop artist since the 1970s had not been reimagined for the disco and ""velvet soul"" markets, we might be blessed with more bands like the Boneshakers. Is Randy Jacobs a better axe scratcher than he is a songwriter? That's a tough call, but you'd think that playing the tar out of original bluesy ballads and funky grooves would be enough. With his Strat up front and strings nowhere to be found, this project represents what might have been. If you want your funk without no junk, there's at least the Boneshakers.A later incarnation of the Boneshakers featured Malford Milligan, the former vocalist of another overlooked rock/soul outfit, Storyville, but Jacobs re-formed the original lineup for 2005."
2,Forgetable,"Boring by the numbers R&B. It picked it up because the lead singer did vocals for Was (Not Was), and his vocals are quite good. But his cover of W(nW)'s `I Blew Up The United States' demonstrates, by way of it's failure, the skill of the Was `brothers' as producers."
2,Too scattered to be helpful.,This book is fairly worthless. It describes how to order vegetarian food in about 30 or 40 languages. Never gets in-depth with any.It really doesn't tell you much about any particular region. I can't believe it doesn't have the same title as his other book. I was really disappointed in this book. Pass.

3,worth [the money],"It's worth [the money], the quality is ok, but nothing to write home about. The included driver wouldn't load on win 98SE, had to download an updated driver."
1,jeeezzzz,"man nothing workedi couldn't get the video to play, when i did the resoultion was just horrable. im sorry, but i give this product a 1"
3,price is way out of line,This is a great product with a very pleasant scent.Only problem -- you can buy it direct from BioTherm's own web site for $27DOH ?
2,"Fancy, but not too functional","Item that arrvied was a solid color, instead of the checkered pattern shown in picture (and that I ordered). Nice look, but not very warm. Pretty but not functional."
2,white border,"This item comes on 11 x 17 paper, but is not an 11 x 17 image. There is a white border of about 5/8"", which is not shown in the enlarged image on Amazon."
4,Kool,"NOT FOR OUTSIDE, besides that its great it takes a little while for the folding creases to go away though"
5,Intimate Yoga - Definitely for Couples,"This video helped to bring the romance back into my life. I loved doing the yoga with Scott and Shawna. Being an avid yoga practicioner, I think they are a very experienced yoga couple. Everyone should purchase this video ... it's a must for the video collection."
5,On The WInds Of Destiny,An adventure most of us can only dream about. The author makes us feel on board during her thrills and trials. An education on sailing is received while enjoying the voyage.
3,Buy it used or bargin bin it,"Although these guys rock they do it only one way, all of the songs sound the same - some faster than others, some slowed down. I got this because I heard the Policy of Truth cover they did and I like that song, it's a great cover, but it doesn't make it worth the whole CD."
3,part two is a little weak.,"after reading broken batpart one i couldn't wait to get my hands on part two and three.but i found that i was just let down by part two.it realy had no interesting story line other than you get to see the new batman's madness.i do how ever sugest reading it though,as it is part of three storys.may be one was so good that the writers couldn't match it.the hilight of this book is robin.they made his cariture strong and interesting.my advice is save money and buy it used.you need to read it to compleat the story of the nightfall storys."
5,A good game with the most awesome robots ever.,"Finally a game I can play for a long time! I only bought Tokobots a few hours ago and so far, I haven't been able to put it down. It's addictive almost. The graphics are well done as well as the gameplay itself. My only complaint is the camera system (you have to move around alot to get the right angle). Otherwise a great game. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone only because not everyone is into puzzle-platformers."
3,Tokobots,"I bought this game because it had a very unique storyline: boy runs through ruins, trailed by Tokobots who help him out during his expeditions. It looked cute and fun to play. Plus, it's apparently discontinued so that made it even more valuable to me. I guess the only problem, but a major problem, is that you cannot control the camera angles. If you want to look at what's ahead of you, you have to run your character around in a circle until the camera moves to where you want it to be. This makes attacks and moves difficult---it can also give you a headache (as it did for me). If you don't mind not being able to control the camera, and compensating for this lack of control with cumbersome means, then get this game. It's fun nonetheless."
4,Not a lame ps2 port,"Finally a game for the PSP that isn't a ps2 console port. Tokobot is a very unique platformer game. Robots follow you around and you issue them commands to enter different formations. I was very skeptical at first but after playing changed my mind. It took me a little bit of time to really get into the game.My biggest complaint is the camera is hard to control sometimes. But pressing L generally fixes the problem. My only other complaint is the lack of any multiplayer support although it'd be hard to imagine a multiplayer tokobot.This is one of the few games that would be appropriate content wise for childeren although some puzzles may be too complex for them.I was talking to a friend of mine about this game and he misheard me and thought that I said toking bots. No, it's TOKOBOTS I yelled back through the staticy cell phone connection... Ask for it by name."
5,yeah!,"Now this is a true great platformer.You begin with 6 tokobots and they help you cross obstacles and defeat enemies.Throughout the game you collect more tokobots and more machine forms which can be used to attack and help,examples are:a samurai robot,a large cane,a bomb tosser,a glider and more.The story is not expectacular but it's still good.The good part that makes this game good is how the tokobots help you through obstacles.Point is,Tokobot is a great platformer with no flaws,great price and super fast loading times.Great for everybody,so buy it and have fun with it.The problem is that the game solds out fast."
3,Older ones were better.,"I bought this table in Cherry to go with one I had gotten over five years ago. It is still a strong, sturdy table, flexible, and easy to assemble (even for a woman).However, this table does not have the quality of the old one: it is not as fine grained as I would expect in cherry; it has more knots or pits; it is much lighter in color although I know it will darken; and there are more individual boards used to create a shelf. For now I have taken and put one of the shelves from the older table on the top of the new one to have them match, and am letting the new shelves darken in hopes they will eventually show less difference."
2,"No good, there are better out there","don't waste your time, the pictures seem as if they are from the early 80s, even I can't identify with some of them"
5,a terrific reference,"I bought this while beginning grad school in anthropology back in 1995, and still turn to it regularly. There is much to argue with in terms of interpretations of particular authors' work but as a well-documented and concise reference work it can't be beat."
1,Groucho was right!,"Save your money and for sure don't buy this book! The only funny thing stated in this book was from Groucho Marx. He said, ""From the moment I picked your book up until I laid it down I was convulsed with laughter. Someday I intend reading it."" In respect for Groucho, I would have this to say to him, I read the book and there was nothing funny or laughable except for your quote."
5,wow!,"Craig Childs is an excellent writer, and the prices for used books of his were great. I could buy copies for all my friends."
2,Hmmm...,"One reviewer cited ""pseudo-intellectual mumbo-jumbo that gives the reader the impression that he is just trying too hard to write a ""serious"" book"" regarding Childs' ""Soul Of Nowhere"". I must agree. I have spent a good part of my life in the deserts of the Southwest and beyond, and am a professional archaeologist, so I expected to like this work more than I did. It felt a little bit too forced, as though the author were trying to convince his readers that what he was experiencing was somehow more profound than it actually appears to be on the surface. I wasn't buying all of the forced weightiness ascribed to what amounts to rather mundane situations. I must follow up by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed ""House of Rain"" despite some extremely irresponsible behaviour on the part of the author. ""Soul of Nowhere"" was a disappointment."
5,Awesome book,"Another great Craig Childs. Words that speak to the soul. Stories that flow, and takes you to great desert landscapes. And best of all takes you to a different perspective."
2,Lots of information. Not easy to use.,A very informative book but really more of a library reference than a field guide.There is a lack of pictures and no reference to edibiity. Names in Spanish are missing.Fishes of the Pacific Coast is much better.
4,Two Lovers. One chance. No Mercy,"The hills echo with explosive action when a city boy gets caught in the deadly crossfire of Trapped Country War. Driving cross-country, Ryan (Robert Estes, The Uninvited) makes a wrong turn and winds up in a backwoods hell ruled by the savage Luddiggers. Sparks fly when Ryan tries to rescue the clan's sexy ward, Lacey (Besty Russell, Avengine Angel), only to find himself a victim of their sadistic brand of justice. Aided by an embittered Vietnam Vet (Ernie Hudson, Gostbusters), Ryan must fight back with every lethal weapon in his arsenal - if he is to survive."
1,Beware...........................................,Worst movie ever the creture on the front cover is not even in the movie you do not see the monster which is a beast until the last 15 minutes...Do not waste your money on this home made movie Please take my word for it it is that Bad...............The majority of the movie is talking........
1,B-movie at its worst. Huge waste of money. Zero star out five.,I regret I rented it. I will never rent these B-movies again. There's no special effects. The acting is just like the one performed by high school students. The beast? It looks obviously like a man wearing a mask. What a waste of time and money.
4,The cord's a little short,"This is fine for use with a laptop or some set-up where the USB port is close to the mousing surface. We had to get a USB extension cord so our 3-year-old could use it on ""her"" PC (one of our old ones, which she's claimed). Once we took care of that, she loves it."
2,They appear to be on my side...,"The music is acessable to me, but I really want you to do exactly what their name says. Dread Ashanti. ...In other words: I don't really like this type of music all that much, but I'd much rather listen to it than Ashanti. peace..."
2,BEAUTY OF THE SEA ~DREAD ASHANTI,I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE CD BECAUSE I HAVE NOT HEARD IT AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT BEFORE ANY ONE ELSE DOES.
2,Just A Great Read,Enjoyed it from beginning to end. One of those books that won't let you go until you finish it..
1,Don't trust Visiondecor Furniture,Ordered a chair with stripes like on the picture.Received a different chair with flowers all overit. Don't trust Visioncoder Furniture!
3,Beautiful Dribble Kettle,"I wanted a pretty tea kettle and this one sure fills the bill. Looks lovely sitting on top of my stove but... You can not pour water from this tea kettle without dribbling the water on the counter top. Very distressing as the water is boiling hot. Have tried pouring the water both fast and slow but it still dribbles as you pour leaving your cup sitting in a puddle of hot water. What ever happened to pretty enameled tea kettles with graceful spouts?Corelle Coordinates 1-1/5-Quart Personal Teakettle, Simple Lines."
4,Buy it if you like exploitation film trailers,"This DVD contains two features. The first is over an hour of exploitation film trailers with just a couple interesting ads for small scooters of the 60s thrown in for fun. 90% or more of these are biker flicks and if you enjoy such trailers you should enjoy these too. There are 41 trailers in all, some for really obscure films.The second feature is an amateurish but fun segment called Biker Beat where the man who put this together talks to people about biker films, including a group who are making a biker film with a strong female presence. (think remake of ""Hell Cats"" etc.)If this sounds like something you'd like, it is. If not, don't buy it. I felt the entire DVD would have been much improved by an index of some kind to the trailers if even a list or a menu, but there was nothing of the sort. Therefore I gave it four stars instead of five."
1,johnny legend presents biker mania,"Do not, I repeat do not waste your money on this piece of gargage. It's nothing but movie trailers ! I know I should have read further, but I let the previous reviewer influence my purchase, shame on me."
3,Could have been better,"This book isn't bad. There's a lot of heart and soul. But there is a major problem telling apart the voices of the two narrators. They spoke, thought and reacted much of the time exactly alike. It was sometimes impossible to tell who was speaking from the prose itself. It made the book harder to read than it needed to be and ruined a lot of the tension.Bauden should get a better editor or publisher with a better editor. Maybe then she'll write a book with more than the promise of being good."
5,Clarification,"As publicist for Di Bauden, I feel compelled to respond to the review entitled Second Try posted here. It is not our style or wish to debate reviews. We respect everyone's opinion and right not to like a story. But the criticism in this review is based on an error by the reviewer. The writer comments on the book being written in first person. However, it is not written in that style. I suspect the reviewer may have read the original online `draft' of this story, which was written in first person. The published book is NOT written that way. The online draft is posted as a preview for fans on DS Bauden's web site but was not fully reviewed by Bauden's editor nor was it to be the version published in book form. We appreciate all readers opinion's and are grateful for the feedback received. But there is a very clear difference in the online version of this story and final, edited and published book. -- Ann Wesley"
3,No Opening to Sync/Charge,Major flaw is you have to take it out of the case to sync/charge your iPod!
2,All Scuffed up,Opened the package and there were scuff marks over it. I thought it would wipe off but doesn't. If I didn't know any better I'd say it was used. Also have to remove from case to sync.
1,envoi CD,non reu à ce jour. je ne peux donc pas exprimer un avis sur ce produit que j'attends avecimpatience.
3,Leather needs to break in,"I love Indigo's clogs. They are clogs with a platform and style. They are very comfortable and stay that way for a year or two before breaking down. They are kind of like a bra. They look good, feel good and then just lose their structure and need to be replaced.This particular style is made of leather that is very stiff and will require multiple wearings to become comfy.Otherwise, they are platform, and pretty."
3,Could have been better...,"This book, although it starts out very slow, has some good action and romance toward the end of the book - it just takes 400 pages to get there. I did enjoy it, and it is a good historical fiction novel."
5,Essential guide and reference,"A 'must have' book relevant to any version of Linux. A 'text book' format that presents general theory along with optional exercises for review and practice (organized for basic and advanced levels).Part V is what makes this book indispensable, providing over 200 pages of a most comprehensive catalogue of command references in alphabetical order (indicating options, notes and discussions of each with numerous examples).An appendix with a glossary of general terms extends the usefulness of this book for non-specialists."
5,Excellent and clear book for starters,"If, for hobby or work, you need to dig deeper into Linux than just using the graphical user interface and its windows, this is an excellent book to get started. While it won't make you a system admin just yet, and while (as the previous reviewer remarked) it has some omissions, I for example could not find clear examples how to use tunneling with ssh, this book will give you a pretty good grasp of Linux and its commonly used accompanying programs, like vi, emacs, awk, sed, and perl. Overall, this is the book I wish I had bought when I first started using Linux, and while I will probably need some additional books for the really advanced topics, this book gives a very solid base for further studies. I recommend it highly."
5,A very useful learning tool,"This book is a very useful tool for anyone who wants to ""get behind the hood"" so to speak and really start putting the power of Linux to work. What I find particularly frustrating about man pages is that they never include examples---Sobell, on the other hand, outlines very clearly what the command does and then gives several common, easy-to-understand examples which make it a breeze to start shell programming on one's own. As with Sobell's other works, this is simple, straight-forward, and easy to read. A great book that will stay on the shelf at easy arm's reach for a long time."
2,For beginners only,This Practical Guide is really a *Beginners* Guide for linux end-users. The volume is comprehensive from the point of view of an end user that is new to linux. I was looking for something with more depth for that could assist a beginner that is setting up linux server. Most administrative tasks like setting up networks and local services are glossed over with no practical reference.This book goes back Amazon.
2,"A fair book; not great, not bad.","I purchased this book thinking it would help me learn Linux Shell Programming. It did not. First, the material is too high level. Second, some of us are still constrained to the original Bourne shell. The book does not cover the Bourne shell. For example, why does the following script not work:if [$# -lt ""1"" ]thenVAR=$1fiAnswer: There is no space after the opening square bracket. I found that out from an online tutorial that I can read for free any time I want.Why didn't I send the book back, or sell it? Answer: I would have to pay for shipping, or receive less than I paid. At least it looks pretty on my bookshelf."
3,Average...,"This book is average...at best...There are better books out there...if you are going to buy this book, buy another to go along with it...-C"
