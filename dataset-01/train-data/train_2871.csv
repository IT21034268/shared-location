3,Bit of a disappointment,"After reading Mars, Venus felt like a letdown. Felt like I was reading Jack London's SEA WOLF mixed with a Lester Del Rey SF novel meant for young teens. The two just don't mix well."
4,Book became more interesting as I read further,"When I first started reading this novel, the storyline seemed somewhat simplified - and a throwback to the pulp sci-fi stories (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Bova's story is a quest to explore Venus, but thankfully turns into an interesting page turner. Yes, things seem to happen to easily in the beginning, but the characters and plot grow on you. By the middle of the book, it becomes a page turner. It's definitely worth picking up!"
2,Venus by Bova,"I just finished this book on tape. Had I not been behind the wheel for 1000 miles, I probably would not have completed it. The plot is elementary and completely predictable. The chapter titles in general are able to summarize the entire plot in 1-3 words. The main character's personna is built around a medical condition that is completely untenable, particularly with respect to rapidity of symptoms. A number of factual errors regarding Venus and the mechanics of space flight are made. The writer seems to have a limited bag of cliche' phrases which are sighted often (also in other offerings from him). The ultimate outcome is predictable from chapter #1 and no surprises, apart from occasional random acts of violence, are seen."

5,The mouth of the south,"Jerry Clower is the classic southern story teller. His stories are extremely funny without the need for profanity. Real ""family"" entertainment."
5,"Jerry was ""One of a Kind""","Without even hearing this, just looking at the Titles can make me laugh. Some of these I am very familiar with, and my kids had some of them memorized when they were small. Jerry's material has always been so original and TRUE, I know this album has to be something special."
3,"Good singers, but get rid of the #$@#@! crickets","I've liked Tara Maclean's singing in other albums, and the other singers were good as well, but whoever produced this album put (I think fake - it's too regular) cricket noises in several songs for 'atmosphere'(?) and it interferes with immersing yourself in the music."
4,Beautiful Vocals...and...Crickets,"The singing and music on this album are beautiful. Every single song is covered beautifully. If it weren't for the crickets, I would have rated this 5 stars. It would have been much better with falling water or something. The crickets are too regular and don't even sound natural."
2,These games do NOT work with windows XP,"Traitor's gate will not even install on windows XP and The Messenger will install but must be ran in windows 95 mode to get it to run. And... when The Messenger does run, it is only in 640x480 resolution and you can't change that! The Messenger looks bad. I mean really, really bad with faded huge pixilation. Time to let these two titles go away."
3,Mixed bag.,"First one worked for three days, second one was broken out of the box, third one has worked perfectly. Programming is easy and effective. Has worked well in emergencies. Recommend getting the flashing light attachment for anyone who sleeps hard or is hard of hearing."
5,Excellent Radio for Weather Hazards and Civil Emergencies,"This radio is superb. It is easy to setup, and functions very well in our area. It has more options for user selection than any other similar device I've used. No home should be without one."
1,It just died one day!,"During a storm we couldn't figure out why the weather radio wasn't alerting us, every other device (TV, Reecom weather radio, local radio stations) were sounding the alerts. Turned it on to hear the weather announcement and every weather channel on the Midland had a high pitched tone and nothing else. Contacted Midland about it and they said the receiver electronics had failed (electronics don't fail when they are engineered/designed properly from the beginning) and they couldn't fix that. Slightly out of the warranty period they offered to send me their newer model the WR120 for $15 to replace the old one. I took my $15 and used it to buy another Reecom weather radio. Won't be buying anything made by Midland again."
2,No customer service,"Did not receive local alert only regional. Tried to call customer service for several days, could not get through. Sent e-mail to customer support 3 weeks ago, still no response. Would not buy Midland again."
3,S.A.M.E. Limited,"The radio works well and allows you to choose which counties to hear alerts, but does not allow you to choose which types of alerts i.e. tornado, flash flood, thunder-storm, etc. You have to get the next model up for that feature."
1,Had two - be careful,I tried two of these radios. The first one didn't work from the start. Took it back to the store for exchange. The next one only lasted about a year. The alerts stopped working on it. I hope to find a brand that will work longer than a year.
1,2 X Strike out,First WR-100C would not receive SAME alerts. Returned to Walmart and second unit does not work either. My Recom radio alerted to a Tornado watch and at the same time the WR-100C just sat there. I've had it over 90 days so there goes the Walmart return. Midland return charges for warranty repair are not worth the trip.. Glad We didn't have a tornado while the WR-100C was in use !!!! Save you money on this one.
1,"Mediocre reception, and it stopped working","Mediocre, if acceptable reception. It stopped working (wouldn't produce any sound), despite use of volume control, and without having suffered any trauma. Needs to be more reliable."
2,Midland WR-100C,"I don't know if I got a bad one, but it can't receive the weather radio signal without an external antenna, and I live in the middle of a large city. It is a disappointment."
2,Stopped working after 1 year,"I bought this radio about a year ago. It worked fine thru summer thunderstorm and tornado alerts in central Florida. Then about a month ago I did not get a severe thunderstorm alert that I knew had been issued for my area. My neighbor got the alert. When I pushed the voice weather button all I got was a loud continous beep. Replaced batteries, reset the codes and left it unpluged with no batteries and the radio worked fine....for about 2 days, then the same loud beep tone. I think some internal circuit is heating up and failing. I DO NOT recommend this radio. I will look for another brand."
1,Useless,"This weather radio picks up too much interference through the power supply. If I unplug it and let it run on batteries alone, it works great. As soon as I plug it in, I get nothing but static. The only way I can use it on AC power is if I unplug everything else from that outlet, which isn't an option for the location I wish to use it."
1,JUNK,"WHEN THE RADIO CAME AND I STARTED TO PROGRAM IT, PART OF THE DIGITAL NUMBERS DID NOT DISPLAY. I DECIDED I COULD LIVE WITH THIS INSTEAD OF RETURNING IT, BUT IT HAS NOT GIVEN ME ANY WEATHER WARNINGS AT ALL. I CHANGED THE CODING TO RECEIVE ALL COUNTIES AND STILL GET NO WARNINGS. NO LIGHTS, NO AUDIBLE, NOTHING. IT DOES GIVE ME THE WEATHER REPORT IF I PRESS THE WEATHER BUTTON, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I BOUGHT IT FOR. THIS IS THE SECOND MIDLAND THAT HAS FAILED. OF COURSE YOU CAN'T TELL IF THEY ARE SENDING YOU A REJECT FROM SOMEONE ELSE EITHER. THIS WAS BROKEN OUT OF THE BOX. I WOULD SERIOUSLY LOOK INTO A DIFFERENT BRAND."
4,Monitor Opinion of receiver,"Radio itself is quite nice. Display is good, audio output is clear and consice. programming relatively simply..you do need a basic sense of how NOAA S.A.M.E. operations work..to know which decode frequencies are for your area..or you will hear many alerts that don't apply to your area.KSMB9301"
5,know the weather,With quickly changing weather here this product is a must-have. It is of excellent quality easy to set up and to use
4,"So far, so good","Haven't had any really bad weather lately, so can't comment on whether this radio alerts me like it's supposed to.So far, I'd have to say I like this radio. Pretty easy to set up and I get good reception.Only complaint would be the loud ""beeping"" noise when you use the function buttons."
4,Easy to Setup,"Radio was easy to setup w/ instructions. Loud beeping can be turned off w/ button on side of unit, but remember to turn back on to recieve alerts. One downside is that you cannot recieve what type of alert you recive... watch, warning, etc. I wish i would have bought one that had this capability, but that was my error."
5,"Difference between WR-100, WR-100b and WR-100c","I've checked lot of reviews on the web and someone wrote that the ""C"" version incorporates Civil Emergency / Amber Alert functionality. Well, I'm not too sure about the fact that the other two models are not offering this function so I kept looking for the answer.And then I found this one that look legitimate :""""100B v. 100CJust a note for folks that may be wondering, like I was, what the difference is between the B and C models. I called Midland and the B stands for Box and the C stands for Clamshell, as in the plastic packaging that most folks hate to open.Tuesday, May 13th, 2008 """"Thanks to that person who called Midland!!"
1,Bad,"This radio does not work for weather alerts. You don't know it doesnt work until you have bad weather, or on test day. The test did not work and then we had bad weather and Nothing!! It was one day after the 30 day return for amazon and they wont take it back even though it is defective. I feel somewhat let down by them."
5,Good Radio,"The Radio works fine. It is easy to program. I selected the two counties that I want weather alarms for. Of course that means it will wake me at night for a thunderstorm or a tornado (no choice of danger). Radio is completely squelched off until an alarm is received. Or you can push a button and hear weather news at any time.The radio is advertised as various models, delineated by no letter, a ""B"" or a ""C"", but according to someone I talked with at Midland, the letters refer only to packaging. There is only a model 100."
2,Intriguing premise falls flat,"The synopsis for this book caught my eye - that along with some of the stellar reviews. The beginning promises an intriguing twist on the usual regency novel. Unfortunately, I found the writing style to be somewhat stilted. While I understand that this is fiction - many of the situations just did not ring true for me. And the villain just seemed unnecessary and and too over-the-top. Somehow, I think the story would have worked better with out this part of the plot. Also, some of the tie-ups in plot between the heroine and her sons felt too pat and hard to imagine.I would not recommend paying the cover price of this in hardcover. The author seems to need to hone her writing skills a bit more. I look forward to some of her more seasoned works in the future."
2,Didn't quite work for me,"I give the author credit for creating an unusual heroine -- I wish more authors would take risks like this. But the book's execution didn't live up to my expectations. If I read her next book, it'll come from a library."
2,Doesn't Live Up to Reputation . . . .,"I've been amazed at how many high reviews this novel has received but then that only goes to show the very real difference between a reviewer and a reader. I did not find the writing style stellar enough to outweigh the many plot flaws. The primary characters -- especially the heroine -- are almost entirely unsympathetic. Lady Sophia is exactly what you receive when someone doesn't triumph over adversity but allows themself to use it as a defining excuse for every flaw. Realistic? Sure but is ""whiny"" and ""manipulative"" really how you want your romance heroine defined? Charles is no match for her on any level and I respected him less and less the more he fell for Sophia.This is an expensive book and as such has a lot to live up to. I don't feel it does that at all and would say -- give it a miss."
5,Not Your Average Regency,"What a pleasure to read a Regency romance in which the heroine is not a blushing innocent, but a bold, assertive, seductress. This kind of female character is usually secondary, and often a villainess. In SEDUCING MR. HEYWOOD, our heroine follows the path most romance writers reserved for male leads, setting her own rules, determining what she wants, and going after it. In another twist, it is the male object of her affections who is is sweet and diffident, but not a wimp, and it is his love that transforms our heroine. You're read it a hundred times with the roles reversed, but rarely this way. Here is an author who knows the Regency period in exhaustive detail, and who has used it as a setting for a highly original and entertaining story."
2,Last Dance by Anne Lise,"After really loving her ""Rendezvous"" album, I sought out more of her work. Was disappointed in ""Last Dance"". She seems to have abandonned her soft expressive voice which made ""Rendezvous"" so great and now sings much too loudly and comes across as almost shrill."
2,Talk too much,"I guess this film originally comes from a French program featuring an introduction to Glenn Gould. Each track begins with a very short excerpt of Gould's playing, then followed by tons of different people's comments. However the program is unbalanced - around 90% of the time it is about talking, and as a result you cannot enjoy Gould's playing here (well, except the bonus part). Worse, each individual only gives a short talk for around 10~20 seconds, so you are not going to hear a seriously deep comments either.I do not recommend this film to people who already know quite much about Gould, nor to those who buy dvd for watching Gould's playing."
1,So you want to write a bad fugue,Ceaseless talking heads spend 60 unnecessary minutes attempting to sell you the Idea of Gould.
4,Fun Game,"Cicken Little is a fantastic game. This game is full of diffrent things like little bit of fighting, sports, unioform hunt and more.The best part I like is the Carpool Craze."
2,Plans are nice but the building instructions are dated,"Having the drawings included with the book is nice because you don't have to loft them from offset tables of buy plans separately. The building directions are dated. For example, this book still recommends using polyester resin. Epoxy resin is superior for this application. Also, things like cove and bead strips are not discussed. I have the Canoecraft book by Ted Moores and I really like the variety of designs in his book as well as the detailed instructions."
3,I built the kayak from this book,"I had built a '19 woodstrip canoe through Minnesota Canoe Association plans. With that signficant experience I later built the kayak in Hazen's plans. I completed it, it is beautiful [a testimony to the wonder of wood and the strip-building technique] and it floats. However, Hazen's instructions are so incomplete and vague compared to the issues I encountered in building it [and joining the two halves was about 5 hours of successful cussing], that during the construction I kept seriously wondering if he didn't borrow that section from a friend and he had not built it himself.The kayak rolls so easy I am not able to use it without an outrigger though a few people can manage it. I would recommend a more flat-bottomed kayak to anyone unless they have experience with such a cigar-shaped rounded design."
2,Disappointed,"The book was in good condition the only problem was the templates needed to actually build it was not in it even though it stated ""with foldout drawings""."
3,The Stripper's Guide to Canoe-Building,"If you are about to get into canoe building, I can not recommend this book. It is more of an over-view of the process than a step-by-step guide. The passages a written without a clear set of images or illustrations to accompany them. I built my first canoe in this style, and while I got a decent product out of it, I couldn't have done it with this book. I used Canoecraft, and found it to be excellent. However, if you have another source of instruction, I would recommend the purchase of this book.First, this book comes with plans, and plans are expensive.Second, you can't go wrong with more than one perspective. I have never suffered from too much information when about to begin a project.Final word: buy it, read it, and get another book to help you out."
2,"Disappointing in terms of written content and illustrations,","This book was somewhat disappointing in terms of written content and illustrations. With few exceptions, the drawings were done rather poorly in freehand. The book contains a fair amount of unnecessary ""spiritual"" content, room that could have been much better spent detailing tools, materials, and technique. The writing flowed rather poorly. However, included were some photos of unusual finished products. I would first spend my money on Gil Gilpatrick or Ted Moores."
3,"harf to use, broke in a week","Broke in one week, amazon replaced. Better buy is the petsafe yard 400 with rechargable collar and handset."
4,This is one of the best purchases I've ever made!,"We bought this for our new Whoodle puppy. She's 6 mos old and being part Terrier, a little bit hyper! It works great! A friend reccomended the rechargable type and boy are we glad, I can't imagine the cost of batteries. She listens, stays in the yard, and we are working on leaving the cat alone. She's now better behaved that our 13 year old dog. The only problem I see is that there is no tone option to warn her and we have to have the setting fairly high to get her attention. Also the collar tends to loosen up so we do tighten it often. All in all, well worth the money and I've reccomended this to several friends. Truely a great product that we will continue to use to train our new puppy!"
4,"functions well, difficult to figure out","This item works well and seems to be well made. The charge lasts a long time. Probably longer than the 72 hours stated on the label. The instructions for settings did not match what was in the remote, so trial and error were how I figured it out. The tester that comes with it is very handy. It lights up brighter the higher the collar setting.Overall, I am pleased. I just can't give it a 5 because of the level of difficulty in figuring out settings on the remote and how the remote functions."
4,Remote trainer works well,"You have to read all the instructions! The two parts have to be ""connected"" after each charge and you have to do it within the first minute after disconnecting with the wall charger. This took a while for me to figure out. It stopped working after a month--I had to replace the battery in the handheld device. Be prepared for that.I have a doberman puppy that gets wild--jumping on my smaller boys, way too interested in my cats, irritating my neighbor's dog at their fence, running the other way when I yell come. She knows who's boss now. It was the only way I could control her. Now when I give her instructions (without the collar or without using it), she is much more likely to comply.I have 10 acres and obviously the range doesn't work that far. I sure wish it did. But if needed, I run until I am in range. You should see my leg muscles! :-)"
3,outstanding except for one page,"My favorite quick read of the year! A very entertaining, romantic story.Some of the observations about business are still true today. Venture capitalists are still looking for that unique product that will make a fortune.There was one page I could have done without: at the point in the plot when the main character decides she's tired of pretending to be a man and is ready to be a woman, the authors got a little carried away, even risqué for children's literature, in describing the main character viewing her feminine body. I understand what they were trying to achieve, but we ""got it"" with a lot less ink.I loved the ""lesson"" at the end of the book: you can't always just sit and wait for blessings to ""fall into your lap"". Sometimes you have to be willing to seek, to risk, and to work for them. Catherine Marshall encouraged the same kind of action in her book Adventures in Prayer, in the chapter entitled, ""The Prayer That Helps Your Dreams Come True."""
4,Simply breathtaking,"I though this book was phinominal.this and Habibi are two books that are worth reading.this book made you laugh, think,cry and have many emotions all at once!And when u think about it you are crying or laughing at a book!and by the way this review is to tell how good the book is not to write a book report on it.i will tell u one thing though if your a woman this book is way better.it is about a poor girl that makes herself wealthy with little if not any help.and this was even harder in a place where women did not have equal rights as men.but that is besides the point.the only thing wrong with this book was it had grammitical mistakes.but it is good nevertheless.BUY IT, IT IS GREAT!!!!!"
5,A Great Book!,This is a great book! If you are looking for a good book to read this is it! You will love this exciting tale of sadness and happiness. I definitely recommend this book!
3,Freezes shut...,"I have two of these vents installed. They are still the only ones that I have been able to find that direct the airflow away from the house. With any freezing temperatures, they routinely freeze shut. Luckily I have them installed within reach of the bathroom window. Our routine on winter mornings is to turn on the fan and then reach out the window and crack the icy bond that keeps the flapper closed. It's fairly annoying, but manageable. Unfortunately, the other drawback is that although the duct is 4 inch diameter, the actual exit out of the flapper is only about a 1"" by 4"" rectangle. This causes a significant flow restriction. Our Panasonic ultra quiet fans are actually much noisier due to the flow restriction. I wish there was a better vent available."
4,Great option for low profile roof,The vent was an easy install with a low enough profile (inside) for me to attach and fish an exhaust hose through my low pitch roof. The only downside I see is there is no insect screen to prevent the pest getting in. I will watch this next summer and watch how the vent performs over the winter. Overall for the price and the low profile inside and out I give it a 4 star rating. 12/6/11 Update: Just a note the flap does not close completely all the time mildly annoying but as I stated above this was the only vent I found to fit in my low roof. Next summer I may try and fit some screen in there so as to keep the bees out.
4,Tough to find item,"This item was impossible to find at the big home improvement chains, ordering online seemed the only way to find it. This undereave vent allows venting of a clothes dryer or bathroom exhaust fan through a home's soffit or eaves, instead of through a wall or through the roof. As a DIYer, venting through the soffit for my second story bathroom fans was a less expensive and less dangerous alternative to installing roof vents. Item works great. Pretty simple item, not much to go wrong. Wish it was more readily available."
4,great soffit vent,although it's not advisable to vent thru the soffits since the moisture can be pulled back into the attic. This one actually vents OUT so that minimal moisture is pulled back into the attic. Best solution is to go thru the roof!
4,Needed an under eve dryer vent - Does the job,"This vent mounted easily and looks good, even on the front of my home. The only complaint is that it seems to block the airflow some as the rectangular opening is somewhat smaller than a normal vertical mount. I assume it is that way to make it less obtrusive. Happy overall."
4,not long enough,"I have listened to a sample and it is entirely too short. Hearing the whole song would only encourage someone to go and buy the album, not listening to only a feww bars."
4,"A perfect ,polished platter","In Square Circle makes it plain that the 70's are over(at least in the case of Stevie's music),but his melodic gifts makes this a worthwhile album and the best of his musical phase that began with the post-Musiquarium period.Part Time Lover is a deserved #1 song(as well as his last),and Overjoyed is the most beautiful song ever recorded.Other strong cuts includes I Love You Too Much,Whereabouts,&Never In Your Sun.Go Home about the love rejected,now regretted scenario may have sounded good on paper but doesn't hold up on repeated listens.The albums weakest moment are his social conscience songs(Spiritual Walkers,The Land of LaLa,It's Wrong)showing how much we miss the Stevie Wonder of Innervisions.ISC may not have the soul of his 70's recordings,but his heart is in the right place."
4,"Buy the Vinyl and Enjoy a Tactile, Visual, and Audio Experience","This is Stevie Wonder, so you know that its good. ""Overjoyed"" is my favorite track on the album, but a few of the tracks do sound pretty dated.Since, I haven't seen anyone else comment on this, I thought I would add a few words about the album art and inserts. The rocks and the disk on the cover are embossed, as well as the leaves on the back. Cooool. Stevie Wonder wants you to FEEL the leaves in his hands.There is an insert including all the lyrics, but it also includes a very far out dialogue between a character called ""Songlife"" and a character referred to as either the cynical or sarcastic one, which incorporates all the names of the tracks, (I'm guessing was written by Stevie Wonder?). Anyway, the insert has some wonderful pics of Stevie that make me smile. Well worth it to have on vinyl to look over all this neato stuff inside while you listen."
4,Some fantastic tunes but Stevie's muse got him to do mechanical stuff too,"This album has 3 or 4 fantastic tunes, which rank with the best stuff Stevie's ever produced. However,a few disappointing tracks due to their ""machanical"" feel. A very good album, but I can't give it five stars."
5,The Greatest of ALL Time,Stevie Wonder is by far one of the greatest musicians of all time. Everything he does is on point and relative to anyone and everyone who has an ear for great music. There has never been a Stevie Wonder song that has not inspired us to feel a certain way. Even if it was just happiness for the time the song was playing! Stevie is truly a musical mastermind and deserves hie own musical museum so all can relish in the skill he possesses.
5,A must read for serious practitioners,"This book is the result of a research so extensive that more than justifies the price.Vesna Wallace gives us a detailed work of such depth that every serious practitioner would welcome with open arms as one of the top works on the subject.I bought both of her volumes , this one , and the companion ""The Kalacakra Tantra the Chapter on Sadhana together with the Vimalaprabha Commentary"".While neither is ""easy"" reading, its a delight for those REALLY Interested on the subjectThank you Professor Wallace!"
4,very pleased,the product was on time and in the condition it was promised to be. fun game i haven't played on a long time.
2,This game is a disgrace,I bought this game this winter and I would like to say that the graphics aren't that great. It also lacks respect to many things in this world. You punch people into the road so they get hit by cars. And if dogs chase you you kick them. Also to top it off I was babysitting a 7-yr. old this summer and I said okay for him to play so he was fooling around with the buttons and he found out that you can give people the finger on that game. Now he has been acting like an idiot since. I would say not to buy this game it isn't worth the money and isn't for youngsters.
2,"Not a Favorite, Bad for joints","I've happily used several of Denise Austin's workout dvd's for more than a decade however this one in my opinion is terrible. I like the fact that you can customize your workout but the love ends there. I found that form and safety are sacrificed in the effort to create ""fresh"" exercise moves that do more for banging joints than effectively working the muscle or raising the heart rate. The kettle bell inspired segment is the worst, no emphasis is put on controlling the weights and is just plain dangerous."
4,beginner level to intermediate,I have never purchased a Denise Austin. I liked the workout however I felt like it was for a beginner level to intermediate. I still use it but on easy or light days
5,Great video for mixing it up,"I got this video to supplement my normal cardio routine - my favorite 2 routines are the Kettlebell inspired and cardio sculpt. The difficulty can be changed up by upping the weight on the hand weights that you use with these workouts. The mixed martial arts and athletic conditioning are a little more challenging, so I have not done them as often (am working up to including them more regularly). I am also a little challenged in the coordination department, so I have had to take the moves slower than Denise does in the workouts at first, but I have been able to get them down.I wear a heart rate monitor when I workout, and I find that this does get my heart rate up for a great cardio workout! The fist time after this workout, my arms and legs were a bit sore for a day or two after, but since, I have not had any soreness, and I use this video 1 - 2 times per week as part of my normal workout."
5,Jerry is Awesome!,"This DVD by Denise Austin is good in that the exercises are mixed between challenging and then kind of easy (to give you a small cool down). I mean, don't get me wrong, it definitely will make you sweat, especially if you do all 4 workouts. And some of the exercises are really fun.My favorite aspect about this DVD is that she has male instructors with her. And there is this one she calls ""Jerry"" who is really fun. Yeah, it is the small things that I guess I like, but it is better that she has a mix of women and men instructors I think.Overall, this is one of my favorite of Denise's workout videos."
5,denise austin dvd's,have many of denise austin exercise videos. very good and very easy to follow. it really works you out with the aerobic sections. would recommend this video to all.
2,CAN'T FOLLOW....,"This is one of the worst work-out dvd's I've ever purchased. I can't follow her. She gives ZERO instruction and jumps from one move to the next so fast, by the time you have figured out what the heck she's doing you've already missed the next move. This is one that will go into the donation pile without stopping on the shelf."
3,Watch out for the kettlebell segment,"What I like best about Denise Austin, and this DVD, is that there is no magical promise to make you 10 pounds slimmer in a month. Instead, Denise focuses on more energy, stronger muscles, improved flexibility and higher metabolism. In other words, she promises to make you feel better in 30 days. That's a real goal, and a darn good one.I used this video daily for about 2 1/2 months and I noticed an increasing amount of pain while doing the overhead lifts in the kettlebell segment. I stopped doing that move but continued with the rest of the workout on a regular basis, but the damage was already done. Now after 2 MRI's I've learned that I have a herniated disc at c5 in my neck. Permanent damage."
3,Not a favorite....,"This video will get your heart rate up and will challenge you. However, I really don't think it is all that good. Denise has much better workouts - like her Boot Camp Total Body and her 3 Week Boot Camp. The moves seem disjointed and there are not enough reps in the cardio segments. In the weight segments there is entirely too much swinging involved. In fact, having done this video 6 times, I can honestly say that it is the only Denise Austin DVD that gives me a severe neck ache after each use...not a good sign."
5,A Very Good Underrated Temptations Album...,"...you will love the cuts ""Lady Soul"" and the super smooth title track. But that jam ""Someone""? That tune alone is worth the price of the CD. It is truly awesome."
3,"Liked, Not Loved","I give this cd a 4 star. Though the men have excellent vocals, I don't know; I wasn't really moved by any of the songs. They seemed overproduced and too slick and poppish. My spirit wasn't moved. There is nothing like communing with the spirit(s). I know I am comparing in my head their 1975 A Song for You, which I absolutely loved. The music and the songs stay in my head long after I have taken them out of my cd player. All of the tracks moved me in some way. That cd seemed more earthy.I really liked this cd, but love, no. However, I would highly recommend it. As I said, the vocals are excellent."
3,Documentary 101,"For the Gould newcomer. The rest of us (Gould afficionados) should probably steer clear since we've seen and heard better. A basic documentary, rife with talking head commentary (although Tim Page's observations are worth listening to) and snippets of Gould looking Gouldian--mufflered, mittened, behatted, etc. One high point, though: the film of Gould swooning over the keyboard during a performance, rivulets of sweat sliding down his face, is breathtaking--the man was, after all, gorgeous in his youth. That ""scene"" is ranks above five points; the rest drags it down, though."
4,Saddle Club,"I really like this game.*Favorites*-You get to ride all day-It says that the other ""people"" go to sleep, but that really isn't true*Cons*-After a while when your galloping, the horse stops galloping and you have to canter the rest of the way-It takes a long time to take care of your horse-THERE IS NO PONY CLUB EVENT SHOWSIt is a good, but there is still lots of work that needs to be done on this game."
3,Saddle club,I'm 8 years old and I do like The saddle club. It can be confusing and the clues don't help alot. I stopped playing it because I'm stuck at the castle and I can't find the golden object.
3,I need Help with this game please.,"I am stuck on the part where is says ,""A shining light above the sea, shows the place you want to be, The path to this wreck is hidden well, so find the tree and break its spell, Leaves of green to the floor, hide the path to a secret door,"" see ive played this game so many times up to that part, and i can never get past it. then the guy at the lighthouse says to take the road back to town, and look on the left side, but your diary says to turn left at the T intersection away from the lighthouse, please someone help me out with this, i am in desprate need to finish this game, my dad ordered it last year on the computer, and i have been trying to figure it out since then, and i stil dont understand it. This is me e-mail, if you could please help me. [email address]"
4,4-Star Rating Fits This Game,"Willowbrook Stables is a fun game. You get to pick characters from Lisa, Carole, or Stevie. Which ever character you choose, you get to pick what their horse looks like. Say you picked Stevie. Her horse's name is Belle. Originally in the game, Belle is black, but you can choose from dapple grey, white, bucksin, liver chesnut, etc. There are some good shortcuts in this game. You can press T once, for a really quick 'tack up.' When you're on your horse, you can click on your diary, go to the map, and click on the location you choose to go. Or you could simply ride there without a shortcut, which sometimes takes forever. I give this game 4 stars because it's graphics are okay, it's fun, and either horse-lovers or non horse-lovers will appreciate the game. I took off 1 star, because some parts in the game are confusing. But don't worry. I figured them out, so I bet you will too! :)"
3,HELP!!!,"OK,um...I guess I SHOULD review it so:Graphics pretty goodCan be boring but then something happens to intrigue you and make you continue playingThe stalls get dirty a little too often for my liking...oh well.Ok, the main reason I'm writing is because the stupid customer support that they have DOES NOT help you!! I am stuck at the castle where I am supposed to find this golden object. I don't want to give my email away and I don't mean to clutter but if someone else reviews this game and wants to say something and THEY ALSO KNOW THE ANSWER to my problem, COULD THEY PLEASE ADD THAT IN?!!Thankz"
1,Doesn't work,"I bought two copies of this game. Both of them had bugs and wouldn't finish. When you write to the company for help, they never respond."
3,Too much $$$$,I really want to get this game but its way too much is it really worth my moneyI play alot of horse games and they are really fun but what if this one is bad i will be wasting 50 dollars
4,A Great Game!!!,"this game is pretty good. it is hard in some places and i have been stuck at certain points in the game, but otherwise it is a great game for anyone who loves the Saddle Club!!! the sound of hoofbeats is quite realistic and the graphics are average - better than the 'Mary Kings Riding Star' PC game if anyone has played this. my only complaint would be that it takes forever to get from one place to another."
5,Help,The riddle is talking about the castle and there's a golden object you have to get there hope this helps
2,So over priced,This game is sooo over priced that I might not get the game because I can't afford it. I am savving up for a horse and I can't if I by this game.
5,Some kool stuff about the game.,"Some Kool stuff about the game are:1. You get to desing your own horse.2. You get to go fast.3. You get to solve mysteries.4. graphics are cool.5. You get to talk to people.6. Music is ok.7. You get to choose from Lisa, Carole, or Stevie.The clue I got stuck on was finding the golden thing in the castle, wich turns out to be behind one of the sheds. I play it most of my spare time, this is probaly one of my favorite horse games."
2,"Very Slow, But Fun Once It Ran Correctly","This Game is good overall, you can create your own horse,if you don't want to choose from Starlight,Prancer or Belle.But the major downfall is the voices are slow and the words constantly repeat over and over again, making it annoying and hard to control your horse. It has alot of bugs too! It runs pretty well for the first five or six minutes of the game. But if you leave it on. It slows down greatly. I've turned off all the graphic details and lowered everything,but it still stays the same. I've installed the patch twice but its completely useless. But its one of the best horse games I've played SO FAR."
5,"$400,000 Quarterback",An excellent source of history of the early days of the American Football League.Contains information on the creation and first years of the original eight teams. and the importance of the bidding war with the NFL.A must for true fans of the original Eight AFL teams.
5,great workout pant,"I found this pant true to size and very comfortable to wear. At 5'8"" and 150 lbs the length and the fit work well for my long legs."
5,Power Adapter- sent fast and accurately,I appreciated that they sent the product quickly to us. It was the right part and worked correctly.
3,Ecclesiastical donation collection net,"This Ecclesiastical donation/collection net is used in church services around the world. Made of hair fiber from rhinos, it is sturdy, long and even blessed by the Pope. Can be held out at arms length to even get those people hiding in corners, or to nudge those individuals who feign sleep. Comes with instructions on how to rouse up church goers with thick wallets and how to walk humbly during the organ service. Can also be used as a ""ball & net game"" while listening to the usually boring sermons, also comes with a useful 5 ft addition that can be used to remove the cobwebs that form around Jesus' feet."
1,wish it worked,There is no option other than getting your dog bathed. this made my dog feel sticky and left an odd odor. Would never buy again.
2,"A management, not science book",This book is an advertisement for Pritchett Associates. It is not a book about Pathfinder science. The amount of real information about Pathfinder and the team is minimal. There is more Pathfinder information on NASAs web site. The management information contained is not outstanding.
2,"A management, not science book","This book is an advertisement for Pritchett Associates. It is not a book about Pathfinder science. The amount of real information about Pathfinder and the team is minimal. There is more Pathfinder information on NASAs web site. Unless you have never read a quality or other management book in the past few years, this book is nothing special."
1,Defective CD,"The problem is not the content, but rather that the CD, Earnest Tub, Definitive Collection, is defective and 4 of the songs will not play. I tried playing it in the CD player in the car and in the CD player of my home system with the same result. I have purchased many CDs on Amazon and this is the first problem."
5,GOOD ERNEST TUBB COLLECTION,"Ernest was one of my dad's favorites. My dad picked the guitar and sang with lots of these songs. We didn't have television in our house, but I remember both my parents singing, and my dad playing the guitar. This was my family entertainment. The CD brings back great memories for me. A kinder, gentler America that I miss."
2,too easy,I purchased this for my 10 year old son. He found it too easy. He could finish it in one day.
4,Zoo vet is not much better than RSPCA: Have you got what it takes?,"I have just found out about Zoo vet this morning. There are 3 vet techs. One,an orange haired woman that was kind of strict but too short and always says"" Hi,I am Dub"" and very funny. Second, a dark- haired man who is kind of mean and constantly says"" Dude"". And, finally my favourite, a dark- haired woman who keeps her hair into a ponytail and she is really nice. On the box it says E for Everyone players.But, however I quickly found out that Zoo vet is nothing compared to RSPCA: Have you got what it takes? I think there should be a zero rating because the graphics(especially, the short and awful vet tech Dub are pretty dumb and bad, indeed. Really dumb, actually. And very funny she's shorter than Amanda from the RSPCA in England."
5,ANIMALS!,Animals: There are TONS of animals to help. Office: You get to decorate your office. Tools: There are lots of tools to use when you`re helping an animal. Screen: The graphics are so realistic! Over all: GREAT!
3,A big tale about a small place.,"The author did well with this first novel and I give him credit for the effort of writing and publishing it. At times it did seem like a long version of 'How I spent my summer vacation', but my perspective on the places and events in the book are obviously biased by personal experiences that I had during that time and in those same locations. And yes, Captain Mike - I am still ""spry and happy to the point of being goofy"". Page 44."
3,Comes without the case?,"I recently purchased this (Dec 10, 2009) for a Christmas present and I received it quickly. I didn't open the box until I was ready to wrap it, and found it with out the wooden case.I can't reveiw the product yet (Christmas Present), but the picture shown is without the case. Once we start using it I will add to the review.How deceptive is this?"
2,10 miles? I doubt it,"I realize that in the real world you're not going to get a 10 mile range like Midland advertises (don't know how they came up with that figure), but I did expect better than the 1.5 mile range that I obtained. The problem could be that the antenna appears to be smaller than on some of the other frs radios I've had experience with. Also, the g300 is more complicated to operate than need be. In order to get access to the 3 watts of power, you have to go through the menu every time you turn the radio on. Then there's the volume control. Lowest volume is not low enough. Sorry, but I can't recommend this radio."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought the Midway G-300 radios thinking it would be very useful because of the advertised 10-mile range but after some testing I found out that it does not even reach 2 miles maximum power. The FCC regulations require a permit to operate this and other powerful radios, as to prevent abusive uses with it, but I would not waste time and money to apply for this because of the short range (thus limited usage) of this.The G-300 is good for many short-range outdoor activities, inside stores, etc. The volume can be set loud enough for any purpose (sometimes the minimum is not quiet enough!). I found the vibration mode very useful.I got this at Staples for $35 after mail-in rebate, which at that price it may be worth the value. Unless you can get a good deal on this I would not recommend this."
2,Poor Range,"I've used many brands and styles, non match the advertised range, but Midland is the most misleading in calling these ""10 mile"" radios. Tested them over open water, the most ideal of conditions for these radios, on ""HI power"" as the manual describes. They did not even match the range of a $10 Conair 2 mile radio used by a friend. Hi/Lo power made no difference, the controls are functional but you cannot shut of the beeping whenever you press a button. As stated before, the volume is two loud at the lowest setting. Not unusable but very annoying. Not recommended. Buy the cheapest pair of re-chargeable style for kids or everyday use or if you need quality, spend $150 for a decent pair of Motorolas."
1,Doesn't explain JACK!!,"I agree with the other bad review about this book. I had it for a junior/senior level undergraduate class and I found it very confusing. It seems like it already expects you to know how to do most of the stuff. A lot of the problem sets have problems that I swear aren't explained ANYWHERE in the text. Poorly written, hardly any examples (which hint hint, are very useful in a math book) Overall a very bad book I would say, unless you already have extensive calculus/economics knowledge, but then I ask WHY WOULD YOU NEED THE BOOK ANYWAY???"
1,Better be a Mathematician!,"As an undergraduate economics major, I found this book to be written in a manner that presupposed that the reader was a mathematician. While I admit that my undergraduate focus was much more theory based versus quanititative, this book made my life in econometrics virtually unbearable. I sought out other books that were more helpful such as Calculus for Business and Economics by Robert Childress (old but still good!). Mathematical Methods may be a good source for those with great strength in calculus, but it is not for the mathematical novice."
2,Worth $10 but no more,"If you like pain in your hands, this game is for you. It's kind of fun in two player. Your ride and crop a bug through a circuit race and use weapons on your opponents. (not a new idea) I bought it for fifteen bucks and was happy with it. I did end up trading it in though, so it couldn't be that great. All of the high stress whacking your bug for more speed ends up causing a fair amount of pain and i therefor couldn't play it long enough to get good at it."
1,Wrong Case,"I purchased this case because it was listed as an accessory for the Canon G2. Unfortunately, it doesn't fit the G2, but rather the G1. Don't buy this case for a G2 - you need the PSC-2000!"
2,Why can't they design a case with the adaptor in mind?,"The case is ok for the G1, but ONLY if you do not use the adaptor. The case lid does not fit over the adaptor, so you have to attach/detach the adaptor constantly. I use the adaptor all the time for filters and additional lens. That's one of the great things about this camera. But, it's a problem with the case (or should I say the case is the problem).Another thing - I have to remove the case from the camera if I want to pop-out the compact flash card. I like to use an external card reader to load my pictures on the PC, and I have to unscrew the case from the camera to do this.When I tried loading the pictures directly from the camera to the PC using the included cable, I had to slightly remove (unscrew) the case to be able to open the plastic cover on the side to be able to attach the cable. The case butts up too close to the plastic cover for my fingers to be able to open it.The G1 is a fantastic camera, but disappointed with the case."
3,Gets in the way,"Case must be removed to access ports to the camera. Otherwise it does fit the camera, and is made with quality. I end up leaving it off, it just gets in the way."
2,Not Worth It,"Seriously has to be one of the worst movies I have seen in the genre. Not very well done at all and with the cast, you'd think you'd have seen much more of the things people would buy this type of movie for. Sure there is some nudity, but not much at all. I would pass on this one.BTW, It was previously released as Survivors Exposed which has a run time of 10 additional minutes, so I'm not sure if this was edited even more than the other one or not."
2,"Oh, what it could have been","With all this beautiful talent to work with, this flimsy spoofis flirtatious waste of time. The movie tries to have it bothways, funny and erotic, but is rarely neither.Unimaginitive and unstimulating"
4,Great Fun!,"My last review didn't show up -- hope this one does. Love the film, lots of fun, funnier than expected and the girls are all beautiful. Special mention to Shauna O'Brien and Aimee Sweet. A fun parody, but don't expect Shakespeare."
4,survivor,This is an awsome show and i am sure that the EXPOSED DVD will be a lot better with behinds the scenes views ect...
3,Beautiful color,"This is a Beautiful pink! However it is very thin, not for very cold temps, would be great for a cool fall/spring day!"
1,Product swap by RitzCamera,"Like Tushar I too ordered this battery from RitzCamera, at $69 without shipping charges, only to be shipped the BP511a which can be bought online in a number of places for $49. Appears to be a pattern of deceptive practice."
1,Wouldn't hold charge,"Wouldn't hold any charge. Tried several times, packaging was questionable for a true Canon battery. Return was easy except I had to pay postage"
1,I received the wrong product,The battery I received was not the one I purchased. I bought the BP511 1100mAh and I got BP511A 1390mAh.I woundered to know if I can use the one I got please. I have EOS10D.ThanksJuliano
1,This is not a Canon brand battery,"Having previously bought non-Canon brand batteries (non of which held a charge after the first time), I was mislead in to believing this was a Canon brand. After I placed the order, they informed me it was POWWER (sic) brand and I canceled the order. While this may indeed be better than the Canon brand as they claim, the advertisement is very misleading and everyone should be aware of what you are buying."
4,canon battery can be tricky,sometimes the charger says the battery has recharged too soon and it is a false reading. never completely sure of the charge
2,Don't last long enough,"These GENERIC batteries fit well in the camera (Digital Rebel), and work well. But, they don't last even 10% compared to the brand-name battery. They are good for an emergency, when your brand-name battery goes off.Be careful when you purchase these generic kind of batteries with different names. They are all the same, with different names, brands, and prices. I bought 2 of them, with different ""characteristics"" and names, and received the same twice, and was charged twice for delivery of a single package. Buy the cheapest, is the same as the others."
1,Excellent all the way around!,"Thanks guys. Great product and great surviceCanon NB-4L Li-Ion Battery for Canon SD1400IS, SD940IS, SD960IS and Other Select Canon Digital Cameras - Retail Package"
1,COUNTERFEIT BAD MERCHANDISE,"They described Canon Batteries- but both of the batteries I received were generics- which, if you read closely- will void your warranty if you use them. I threw them away- and plan on NEVER PURCHASING FROM AMAZON AGAIN....BIG WASTE OF MONEY"
2,Wrong order,"I ordered this product only to receive another. I really needed the tire but when I got it and it was the wrong one I had to buy it from Walmart. The return was painless though, that is why they go the 2 stars and not 1."
3,"Interesting, but difficult going","This is a book for the intellectual crowd in my opinion. Also, many of the important thinkers who submitted essays were unknown to me. Short bios would have increased my interest level. Read them one at a time and really savor the content."
2,"Good Book, Old Format","I actually couldn't get myself to read this one because the text was just so small and the book was so thick and it seemed much too daunting. I want to get it in a different form so that I can read it, because I'm sure it's one I will like, I just couldn't do it with this one--and I'm a big reader."
5,As heavy as it is insightfull,"It is very heavy reading and you might want to have a deep intrest in the field of pschology. You will learn alot from this book, and it is a book that should be read and re-read a few years later. Great book for introduction to pschoanalysis and great price ;D"
3,A Hit-Or-Miss Collection,"This collection is hit-or-miss. The parts that are truly insightful are utterly fascinating while the parts that miss the mark are extremely tedious (and boring). Nevertheless, it is important to understand one of the greatest thinkers in history and this work is a good place to start."
3,Great but lacking in comfort,"so i purchased this last weekend and thought they were great, but within the first hour my ears were uncomfortable and was thus disappointed. for extended periods the earphone just feels too tight and will beg for you to take them off at some points. maybe it's designed for people with smaller heads. the sound is okay, not great, they're just stereo after all. but they look good and it seems to be a solidly built unlike other headphones i looked at for the price. high as my pain threshold is, i just hope i can get used to the discomfort it brings when i wear it, because it terribly impedes your enjoyment of a game/listening when you have to briefly take it off for a breather."
2,Disappointed...,"I guess I'm not enlightened enough to appreciate this CD. First I would like to say, I ADORE Krishna Das's voice, it's like having a meal it's SO sensuous. I bought this impulsively without noting that it was just ""Hare Krishna"" over and over, because sometimes I just want to mush KD's voice all over my face. While the CD does start out emotionally moving, as it goes on, it just turns into ""white noise"". Particularly the chorus. Buy 'em pizza and some DVDs and keep 'em home next time, KD."
5,A True Gift From Krishna Das,"I stumbled upon this cd quite by accident and decided to purchase it rather spontaneously. The first couple of times I listened to it, I was torn between really enjoying it and feeling a little irritated by its repetitiveness but that soon passed. Now it puts me in an instant good mood and I treasure it as medication for the soul. I use it at work (I work with children) and although people raise eyebrows at first, they all seem to become equally enchanted by it. Do your soul a favour and listen to it as often as you can - it will fill you with joy."
5,Best of its Genre,I listen to this album all the time. It has great power and I feel the bliss that Krishna Dass inspires in those who chant in alternation with him. There are no other albums in this genre that I would recommend as highly as this one.
1,Not worth the money,"With all of the great chant cd's out there, this is not the one to buy. I bought it because it was KD but it was boring."
2,A Disappointment,"I needed a complete, up to date battery reference book. With a publishing date in 2000 and a hefty price tag, I thought The Battery Reference Book by T.R. Crompton would be just the ticket but I was wrong.I admit that there is a lot of information in this book about yesterday's battery technology but look for modern Lithium Ion and Lithium Polymer and you wont find it. Since I can't find this information I worry that other, emerging technologies are coming, and I won't find out about them in this book either.I have to blame myself for making the mistake of buying this book. I should have researched more. If you are looking for a battery book that includes Lithium Ion and Lithium polymer, skip this one."
2,Applicability of Battery reference book to mobile phones,Good overview of battery chemistry and types. However very little up-to-date info on NiMH and lithium ion batteries.
1,Defective disc.,"I have seen this concert before my purchase and it's a great one. My rate it's because the disc didn't play and I think it has some defect. It doesn's have anything to do with it's contents. The delivery was ok. No problem with the region, it's the disc."
4,Toss up - CD or DVD?,"I purchased the Rude Awakening CD 2 years ago when it was first released and being such a fan of Megadeth and heavy metal in general, I really wanted the DVD to see them actually playing these amazing songs. The camera work is good and the sound quality is great. You may have noticed that 5 songs from the CD aren't mentioned on the DVD song list, however they are located under ""special features"". Why, I have no idea. The interview segment with the band is very insightful and interesting as well are the other special features. Overall, I am definately glad I bought this DVD."
5,got to have if your a fan,"good sone selection , great sound , strong cameras angles , very solid performance from then band , i was very impressed with there stage performance ."
4,"It is good, but I prefer the CD","I don't really like the way the DVD was edited. It is frustrating having to go to separate sections to get the extra five songs...on the box it does not say that they aren't part of the full concert. Don't get me wrong...the DVD is great, but I prefer the CD cause it is the same show and goes straight through. And what ever happened to separate shows for the DVD and the CD? Well, this is a good DVD by all means, but I think the way it was put together wasn't so smart. But it is a must have for Megadeth fans without a doubt."
2,Boring DVD!,"I love Megadeth,but I don't like this DVD.There are many things wrong with it.First off,lame song selection.""Burning Bridges"" should have been replaced with ""Moto Psycho"",and ""1000 Times Goodbye"" is a decent song,but they should have put some more old stuff on it.Second,BORRRRRING version of ""She-Wolf"".The drum and guitar solos in this version are endless.Third,they should have let the concert run straight through instead of putting 5 songs as ""bonus tracks"".Fourth,Dave has almost no interaction with the crowd.He used to give great stage raps,and now he doesn't.Fifth,They should have done a live DVD along time ago with Marty Friedman and Nick Menza,the best 'Deth lineup.Only get this if you are a die-hard fan.Otherwise,look around for some bootlegs."
4,"great price, no scratches",for the price and not to have to drive far and then look for it in the store it was great.
5,scorching guitar,so many reviewslet me just say that the guitar work on Carnaval scorchesNatalie rules with her celestial beauty
2,Foreign Exchange,I really enjoyed the Librarian by this author but this was not a patch on that.Would not recommend this book.
3,"Not very good. Boring in parts, silly in others",I didn't enjoy it very much. I thought the plot was silly and that it'd have a much more dramatic ending. Instead it just sortof petered out.
2,Poor read,"I agree with one reader when he or she says the story just petered out, what would be good is if Morley wrote a sequel and let us know what happened to Carlton afterwards and not just let it hang there in mid air."
1,Plastic gears,This sprinkler is one of the best built sprinklers I had ever seen from the outside. It worked perfect for about three months and then it quit moving. After I took it apart I found that drive mechanism is made out of plastic. These gears had broke. I was only dragging 50' of hose well under the maximum lenght.
2,"Best map available, but not good enough","It is quite difficult to become detailed maps of China. As I live in Beijing and like to travel around, I had hoped that this map would be useful. However, although it is the best map I know of, a lot of information is still missing. The main problem is that it does not give the names in Chinese characters, only the english names are given. Further, names of mayor highways are not given, which makes travelling more difficult. Also are new expressways not always shown as expressways (e.g. Beijing-Beidaihe), or are roads shown which do not exist (e.g. Beijing airport expressway seems to continue to Miyun, which it does not do)."
2,Just not what I needed.,"I was trying to move hot air from a wood stove fireplace insert. The one that is built into the unit is too noisy. This Holmes Tower Fan is very quiet but it did not move the hot air, even though we placed it in several places next to the stove. It is a nice unit and we were disappointed in our own expectation that it would do what the unit fan itself is supposed to be doing. Our dealer refuses to address the noise issue and we can't hear the TV over the built-in fan noise."
3,Fan is ok but I think they sent me a used one!,"I would have given this 4 stars but the fan looks like it was used. The box looks old, banged up, and looks re-taped rather than brand new. Also, there's a smell to it, old and musty, but the fan is ok. We have a newer model and it's my favorite. Just wish the fan we just got didn't have a timer feature; rather just an on and off button."
3,"Good, but not great -","Operates nicely and pretty quietly, but air delivery is from 6"" to 3 ft. above floor level. A tilt mechanism on the front of these fans would help a lot. If you're going to purchase a tower fan, get one that is at least 40"" tall - they're more expensive, but worth it."
2,So cheap.,"This thing is beyond cheap. It is not stable at all, and wobbles as it rotates. Also, it made a really annoying noise for the first two weeks, now it only makes it when it's on low. But that sucks, right?"
3,"Great music, great singing, HORRID direction","Teresa Stratas is the very best interpreter of Weill in the modern day (Ute Lemper's hysterically exaggerated emotionalism is just inappropriate for this very spare, almost intellectual music), and she and the other singers and musicians do a fine job. However, Sellars' frenetic and distracting camera work and direction ruin what should have been a 5-star production. A shame as it's the only video record of Stratas singing this music. You might want to rent this first; I wouldn't buy it after having seen it. Too irritating to watch."
5,"Extremely good, terse introduction to systematic theology","I used this book as part of a two semester masters course in systematic theology. I -am- dispensationalist so am probably biased but I liked the level of treatment this book gave.All the topics were tackled, lots of biblical references and it wasn't so wordy that I got bored.I really liked the section on soteirology, I was actually inspired to get a couple of gospel messages out of it.Systematic Theology can be dry. This book isn't."
4,Modern Retooling of the Traditional Systematics,"Thiessen follows the Princeton theologians in his layout and handling of theology, yet differs extensively with a number of aspects of Calvinistic theology. The reading style is a little tough; however, I completed the work before I entered college, so some of my recollection may simply be a reflection on my reading skills at the time. Thiessen's doctrine is conservative and relies heavily on Scripture. Overall, the work is not all that impressive, but yet it serves as a scholarly introduction to the topic of Systematic Theology (albeit, not quite as good as Ryrie). I would recommend this work for those beginning their foray into the field of Systematic Theology, having completed Ryrie's work (Basic Theology: A Popular Systematic Guide to Understanding Biblical Truth), but yet looking for a little more depth."
5,Great book for Doctrinal Foundations,"My husband has told me to buy 5 of these books to give as gifts to people we care the most about. He and I read this book (borrowed from our pastor's library) together. It is a great book to teach you what God's character is. This book would give a new believer in Christ a very strong foundation. It is also set up that you need not read it from cover to cover as my husband and I did. You can read section, paragraph, or chapter and get alot of solid good teaching. Highly recommend. Obviously would buy again, already did!"
3,Overall pretty good,Overall it is a pretty good work. The writing style can be choppy and non-descrip in places often assuming the reader is already well versed in the verbage and arguments used. The reasoning used is sound and most arguments well thought out. With just a little more attention given to making it more reader freindly it could be an awesome work.
3,Rewriting the Ordo Salutis,"Thanks for pointing out how the revision of this booked altered Thiessen's own ordo salutis.The ordo salutis is the order in which a person's salvation is effected. This order is entirely dependent upon your view of the Calvinist-Arminian debate.As was mentioned before, this revision--after Thiessen's death--turns Thiessen into a Calvinist! Incredible!Buy the used, pre-revision edition."
1,If you read it you may start to hate theology........,"If you want to be bored to the death, please do read this so called theology. I personally don't see it as systematic theology, it is more like biblical theology and even in this category is not really good one. It is better to read Grudem work, which I don't like much either but at least it is readable than this mumbo-jumbo of clamping together pieces of scripture out of context. Fundamentalisto-Evangelico-Calvinist outlook, which is not by itself bad, but with this particular author all another views treated as if, those other views are heretical, while not trying to look at significance of historical aspects of development this or that doctrines. Instead of this work of so called theology better read Norman L. Geisler systematic theology, or maybe Millard J. Erickson Christian Theology or even Alister E. McGrath theology. In short, read anything but this treatment of theology."
5,Excellent Product,"I love these shadows. They're great for days when I don't have enough time to really work on my eye makeup. They come in a lot of shades and look great by themselves or paired with other shadows. Samba-dy Loves Me is a nice peachy gold color that looks amazing with blue eyes. It just takes a small dab of product on my finger to cover my eyelid area. Once it has dried (about 20 seconds), it's set for the day. I've never had a problem with them smudging, creasing, or wearing off."
5,Stay put!,Gos on smooth and stays all day long. Does not smear and works great as eyeliner. The best cream shadow on the market!!
2,All dried up,Disappointed! I know these have a tendency to get dried out with age because my sister had one dry up on her.. But this one arrived completely dried up into a solid hard unusable rock. I gave it two stars because they are nice when they're not dried up as mine was. I was so busy at the time of the order that I didn't want to go through the trouble of returning it so it was a waste for me.. The rest of my order was great.. Will not repurchase
1,Usually l like it but,"Usually I love Benefit products and cream shadow in particular, but this was a total disappointment. I do not know what happened exactly but it looks as if the product melted and then hardened again. So, half the jar was empty and the other half was a super hard conglomerate of ""cream"" shadow. It was not easy to spread and the color was off."
1,was dried up..fell out in my hand :(,"This is my 4th benefit cream shadow.....loved all of them except this one.It looked ""shrunken"" in the little pot, felt hard (not soft and cushiony feeling like my others)I turned it upsidedown, and becuase it was so dry and shrunken, it fell right out in my hand :(I tried to mash it up....to make it creamy....no luck.I am guessing it was old.I wanted to order more, but am now worried about getting any other old ones.Dont think I can return this since I tried making it creamy."
2,"""Strut"" is NOT creaseless","I have 5 of these fabulous, no-clump / no-crease shadows, so I expected the same from a 6th color. ""Strut"" is a dark charcoal, and with first use, it smeared and caked on my lids. SO disappointed, at $19 a pop. Love Honey Bunny, Get Figgy, Busy Signal, Skinny jeans, and RSVP. Now THOSE colors get 5 stars!"
4,Love the Product and Color!!! What happened with the quantity>>,"So I got this today. Love the color! A great Smokey Gray.. Now, I have other of there (different colors) and this particular one has a lot less amount of color for the same price... what happened????"
1,Disappointing,"The delivery of this item was fine, but the color was not what I was expecting. The actual color is much darker and browner than it appeared on the website. Not a good idea to choose colors from a website."
3,"Nice product, but dried out...","The color of this eye shadow is beautiful, I have no doubt this is a great product.My problem is the AGE of the product, I don't know how long it has been in the storage, the cream eye shadow is kinda dried out... I could hardly spread it evenly..I would recomment buying it from a real store that has a relatively high turn-over rate..."
1,Completely dried out!,"I own several colors of this eyeshadow - it's great, and I'd recommend it from another source. Unfortunately, this product as shipped is unusable. Like others have mentioned, it's dried out into a sad little hockey puck that is loose in the jar. Not exactly creamy."
2,Crack on eyelid after a few hours,Very matte with a little shimmer. Looks really silver which I didn't like. Cracked on eyelid after a few hours and def not worth the price. I love all of the other products by benefit!
1,Not Cabelas African Safari,"Maybe its just me...but I expect to get the product that is advertised. I received Brownings African Safari instead of what is advertised in the picture above, Cabelas African Safari. So unless you enjoy receiving the incorrect item, steer clear of this."
5,Good game!,"I bought this game for my son. He loves it, and has beat it in no time. But that's not unusual for him, he is a wiz at the games."
3,Hose Reel,"The hose reel is fairly well constructed. The inlet is not tapped properly so the inlet 90 can only be installed a few threads. The arm is also a little too thin and bends slightly when the unit is only held by 2 of the 6 screws. On the bright side, there is nothing that might break."
5,Superb,"I've used more than two dozen different brands of picks, including making my own, and these outshine them all. The grip is seriously the best I've ever tried. I picked a few up on a whim at my local music shop and couldn't be happier. The only downside, and it isn't even really a downside, is that the dead skin cells it accumulates seems to show more than other picks, but just give it a quick brush and you're good to go."
4,"A post-punk Paley finds his voice, creates solid album","After being ahead of his time in Pittsburgh, behind the times in New York, Paley has finally found a real voice (and not one he printed on flyers for The Five for WRCT or WFMU). This is a solid album -- Henry Rollins intensity, Tom Waits gravelly voice, with the simplicity and sentimentality of Billy Bragg. One of the best albums I've heard in a while."
2,That Voice!,"Paley is a roots rock guy with a punk background so I'd expect to really like him, but I can't get past his howling vocals, I just can't listen to his voice. Buyers should proceed with caution, and listen to samples to determine if they can get past the vocals."
4,Underrated and overlooked,"Finally picked this one up and I'm very glad I did! This is a great album that is generally overlooked by all but Marvin Gaye fanatics, but it ranks up there with his best. Very much a concept album, Here My Dear chronicles Gaye's turbulent marriage to Anna Gordy, who received the album's profits as part of the couple's divorce settlement. Emotionally raw but beautifully sung, this one's a lost classic."
4,"Beautiful, sweet, sad, angry, flawed... and human","This is an amazing work of art which I have found more in with each listen. It isn't an easy, smooth r'n'b album; pain and confusion feature as primary themes and some of the tunes are pretty far out. The album is lush with a raw production feel, it features some cool 70's style synths and Marvins harmonies are still gorgeous and textured with perfection.After many listens I can honestly say I think many of these songs are among his best. Some funky grooves and beautiful tunes feature throughout. This is an eccentric offering, no question about it - although for anyone who loves Marvin's Gaye's 70's work and has experienced a painful breakup, this is a gem. Who else could have produced anything like this? Marvin was one of a kind and I love this album."
5,love is there so is saddness,this cd was straight from the soul and that's how I live and I love it and I miss Marvin so much.
4,Great Music From a Very Self-Centered Man,"This is without a doubt one of Marvin's greatest albums. It combines funk, soul, and jazz into one excellent groove! The only trouble I have with it is how self-centered these lyrics are. If you look at the facts of the court settlement surrounding this album, you'll see why. Anna Gordy worked hard to help Marvin get to his superstar status. And what thanks did she get? Marvin goes out and has kids with a girl half his age! What a jerk! Anyway, the music is uniformly excellent throughout. It is a great addition to any music collection (as long as your willing to sit through his whining about attorney fees)."
3,I Didn't Buy It...And Neither Did the Public,"I love Marvin Gaye. But Here, My Dear simply isn't the best album he put out, in spite of what Marvin's biographer David Ritz declared. Yes, you feel his pain, but you also sense a lack of verve. The spare tracks here may be lyrically honest, but also average from a musical point of view. Marvin in his own words at this stage ""was on the ropes"" and this album was certainly a necessary part of his evolution.I completely buy Marvin's pain and what he went through. However, I don't think this was among Marvin's best works. I'm waiting for the album to grow on me, if I can get it on. My review shouldn't stop you from ordering it of course. So please explore!"
5,EMOTIONS,"THIS IS THE ALBUM THAT HE DID FOR HIS EX-WIFE, ANNA GORDY. HE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A HIT WITH ANY SONG ON HERE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THIS ALBUM ISN'T ANY GOOD. HE PUT SO MUCH EMOTION INTO THIS ALBUM THAT IT IS SCARY. SONGS LIKE ""HERE, MY DEAR"",""WHEN DID YOU STOP LOVIN' ME, WHEN DID I STOP LOVIN' YOU"", ""IS THAT ENOUGH"" AND ""ANGER"" HAVE SO MUCH PAIN YOU CAN ALMOST FEEL IT. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM, I JUST BOUGHT IT TO COMPLETE MY MARVIN GAYE COLLECTION, BUT THIS IS MY FAVORITE MARVIN GAYE ALBUM."
5,His Best Work,"Although it begins to flag towards the end (A funky space reincarnation is a real waste of time), this forgotten gem is Marvin Gaye's greatest album. Easily the match of Whats Going On and much better than the vastly overated Lets Get It On. The instrumental work is first rate and his vocals are spot on. The subject matter may not appeal to all, the motives behind its release not entirely clear and the words somewhat ambivalent. However there is genuine emotion here which some may find embarrassing and too much to listen to. A major work of art from a man living on the edge."
3,Psychedelic Resource List,This is a very inlightning book about the enthobotinal plants and there effects recommeded for all enthrobotinists
1,Don't bother,"Terrible interface; one button to do multiple functions and one light to indicate one of 13 different states that the recorder can be in! It doesn't work if you put it in your running pocket; the FAQ on the timex site says it may be static electricity. You'll be better of keeping a log manually until they produce one of these with a better display and control scheme, and one that works as advertised."
1,Problems with Data Recorder,"I just purchased the Bodylink system including the Data Recorder. I love the system, GPS and all, however, the Data Recorder is not working. I already exchanged it once, but second one just failed again on my second time out. The red/green light flashes for a few seconds and then shuts off. It appears that Timex has been aware of the problem for some time."
5,Catch The Fever,"It only seemed natural that two great artists like Spike Lee and Stevie Wonder would work together. The result is a tremendous album from Mr. Wonder that is the soundtrack to Mr. Lee's Jungle Fever movie. After the lackluster Characters from four years earlier, Mr. Wonder is reinvigorated and the music is top notch. ""Fun Day"" lives up to it's name as the song has a bouncy, airy, carefree feeling to it and it floats along like a nice summer day. ""Queen Of Black"" and ""Each Other's Throat"" are funky workouts that have some great keyboard action. ""Jungle Fever"" explores some world beats and ""I Go Sailing"" has a California rock, easy listening vibe. ""Chemical Love"" is a pulsating ballad and ""Gotta Have You"" is fiery song with one of Mr. Wonder's best vocals in years. Jungle Fever showed that Mr. Wonder was artists who could still be relevant."
4,Still amazing,"I have owned this CD for years and it is still a fun yet poignant listening experience. Like all Stevie, it is timeless"
5,Great!,"The product is fun and durable, but sometimes the cloth around the tassle flips over. Other then that, it is a great product, and I would reccomend it to everyone."

3,To clarify something;,"Let me just say this,Shine down Fan said that the main event for the WWF title was Bret Hart vs Diesel.Actually it was Bret Hart vs The Undertaker.Bret Hart had fought Diesel on p.p.v before like at;King of the Ring 94,Royal Rumble 95,Survivor Series 95,and In Your House 6(Spring Explosion)which was the next p.p.v right after the 96 Royal Rumble."
4,erasure mixed with savage garden,This album is extremely catchy its borderline radio freindly. I still like it alot. They realy sound like erasure mixed with savage garden. Thats not a bad thing.
5,"didn't know what I was missing, now eternally grateful!","I discovered this album and Intuition quite by accident, and what a fabulous surprise it has turned out to be! I am woefully ignorant of most of the synthpop scene, yet Further appealed to me instantly. Garrett Miles has a fantastic voice. Clear, smooth, with a golden quality that becomes more coppery when he is really feeling what he is singing. He impresses me with his range and consistency. But what Ken Porter creates with the music lends at least as much mood and emotion to the songs; it lays the foundation for why I can't get enough of this album. The way the music is paired with the vocals takes you right where the lyrics want you to go. Aside from times when I am thirsty for the music be a little more dominant, I love nearly all the songs, especially the second half of the album. There are small bits that I find to be truly brilliant. There is something new to enjoy, something more to feel, each time I listen."
4,good book if you love kawasakis,nice detail in the makes and models of early to late bikes! good descripitions on the story of what is now the premium sports bikes out there
4,The Templars and the Druids,"A beautiful and savvy story of the synthesis of ideas which produced the Cathedrals of Europe. Although written as a novel-and a darned good one, Vincenot has succeeded in being true to the facts of history and following up with his near clairvoyant intuition on historic detail. Vincenot, an award winning writer in France- has yet to be discovered here in the U.S. Here through the eyes of a carpenters' apprentice, he shows how the Druids, the Carpenters, Stone Masons and Knights Templars worked together under the authority of Bernard of Clairveaux, to create the network of great Cathedrals which were the architectural embodiments of all known sciences of the time. This book needs to be read before any travelling in Europe and provides wonderful clues to the aspects of Paganism secreted into Christianity. Recommended to those in the Templar-Holy Grail vinyard and those who just enjoy good ""historic fiction""."
3,Good Album,Some may see this album great for the cold months. I keep it close by to wind down any day of the year. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GUYS!
2,I just don't get this CD,"I have to admit that I'm a purist for Christmas tunes. If this CD was filled with more of the marvelous treatments as what the Boyz did to Silent Night, I would play it constantly. I like Let It Snow, but find that I enjoy it much more on the Soul Train Christmas Fest collection. Each time I sandwich this one between Vanessa William's ""Star Bright"" and All 4 One's collection it comes up lacking. I buy Christmas CD's every year and I'm seldom disappointed the way I was with this one."
2,Not enough,"Baltimore is known as a college town, yet the map cuts off to not include any of the areas around the college campuses. This was the reason for my purchase of the map. My son & I were to go to Baltimore to tour a college there, low & behold, nothing doing. We relied on our Iphone instead. Big disappointment for me, especially after being so satisfied with our DC & Paris maps."
2,Cute but Confusing,"This map was neat in that it had little descriptions of places next to the colored landmark and it was waterproof (which turned out to be really important in Baltimore in October) however, he had a hard time navigating the streets according to the map. The map is also outdated (printed in 2005) so many of the restaurants and stores are no longer there. One last thing, the map is really only DOWNTOWN Baltimore (the harbor and stadiums mostly) but no much outside of there and definitely no help when it came to navigating to and from other towns and airports. If you buy this map, have a REAL map handy also."
5,Sunken Red,"The book starts where the mother of Jeroen dies. For years he has hated his mother and tries to explain why. This leads him back to the Japanese camp where he and his mom spend several years in torment when he was only 5 years old. In the beginning you think of Jeroen as a strange man, but while the story goes on you start to understand him more and more. The ending will move you to tears. This is my all time favorite book and I can recommend it to anyone."
4,Best source available for the Russian royal house,"The most detailed, all-in-one source available for the post-1682 Russian monarchy. Included also are numerous charts and a very detailed index, and some interesting and gossipy appendices regarding the infighting for precedence among the present-day Romonovs."
4,Some Things Are Better Left to the Imagination,"This book was a little bit Too Much Information. I'm not exactly interested in Shakespeare's sex life.... I'm really wanting to give it 3 stars, except that OK, it could explain some things about Shakepeare and perhaps his writing.I did enjoy reading from Mrs. Shakespeare's point of view, as Robert Nye presents it in his book. It was funny and clever, as well as a fresh breath of air. I could see why perhaps London was not to her liking... It was interesting to gain a different perspective on Shakepseare through her eyes and on daily and family life in Stratford.An OK book that reads pretty quickly."
3,Not sure,"I wasn't sure about some of the humour - if that's what it was. I enjoyed the beginning more than the end. I got a little confused with the ending - was it to shock or humour me? i did enjoy the little ""inside jokes"", but that's about it."
2,"awesome musicianship, but lack of substance!","i know coach (singer) and chad (bassist), and i must say these guys are awesome musicians, and that's from a musician's stand point. however, if you listen to EVERY SONG, you hear coach say I or me or my in every verse or chorus or, basically every part of the song. there really aren't any catchy riffs or melodies on this cd anywhere. it was a sophomoric attempt at ""making it"". chad is a really cool guy and a really solid, percussive bassist, but coach is ""self centered"" as you can tell in every song with every other word being me or i or my. you get the drift."
3,fm reception a little troublesome,It is a great looking cd player .the esp mode works well. It doesn't have a loud enough volume. I live in a large midwest city and it never really locks a good signal.
3,good item. Not sure about delivery,I bought this item for my 89 year old mother in AZ and really can't review it.I don't know how long it took for the item to get there....seemed a while.But the item itself is wonderful.J. Andrews
2,Old Timer Guthook,After getting this knife I found it's nothing like the Schrade Old Timer knives of the past. It is lighter weight and the steel is thinner. It's stamped china on the blade. My Schrade Old Timer I've had since 1986 was and is quality. I do and always have taken pride in products made in the USA. I quess Schrade made the move like so many others. Make it look good but make it cheap. Maybe some of the hunters that read this review may think I'm going over board here but then again would you buy a hunting rifle made in China?
1,Not the Schrade knife I new!,I used Schrade Old Timer knives for years. Last Elk season I lost my Guthook. Seen this one and I bought it on Amazon. I was so unpleased after looking at it out of the box. It's not the high quality knive I had but a cheap replica made in China and has the Schrade name.
3,"okay, but not what I expected","It feels sturdily built, but I was disappointed in the look and apparent material quality. I purchased as a gift, but after inspecting it I did not geel that it was gift quality so I tossed it in with the rest of my camping/hunting/utility gear.It came with a decently sharp edge (not true of other new knives I've purchased) and should perform its intended function, but it does not have the same quality look and feel of the Old Timers I remember."
3,Good not great,Not the knife my Father use to carry but it will do the job.It was very sharp out of the box
4,Great knife!,This was bought for a gift and I'm very happy with it. It was smaller than I expected but handles very nicely. Very good knife especially for the money!
5,great present,my son who is all boy wanted a gut hook knife....this one he thought was great. old timers is a quailty you can hardly find these days. Thanks Amazon and old timers!
5,Camper shell light,I bought a pickup truck with a camper shell. They camper shell had no light in it and it was very difficult to find things after dark. I purchased two of these and they did the trick. I can now see everything in the shell after dark.
4,RV lighting fixture,"This replaces the original fixture, which corroded. It looks nicer, spreads light well, and was very easy to install. It gives the RV an updated look."
3,Overcome by events,"It's a good anthology of perspectives about where new technologies come from and the problems of getting them adopted in the marketplace. HOWEVER, don't expect to see descriptions of the next big thing or even how to identify the next big thing. The authors are pretty clear about saying that there's no way to identify which emerging technology is going to take off. See Nassim Nicholas Taleb's The Black Swan for why."
5,Interesting & Informative,"I live in Jacksonville, FL and just lived through the landfall of Beryl last night. This prompted me to once again grab this book and look through the history of Florida hurricanes and tropical storms. Beryl came ashore at 70 mph, so close to a Cat 1 Hurricane, and it is my understanding that this is the first time in history since 1887 that two systems have developed before the official start of Hurricane season. If you are interested in hurricane history and especially if you live in Florida, you will find this book most informative. It is written in a style that is easy to understand and pleasant to read. I am so sorry that Mr. Williams died before an updated version could be written/published. I would love to have the history after 2001, which was a very active decade."
1,Scratches and Velcro,"I bought this case, yet the clear pockets inside will scratch your PDA screen. Also it uses velcro to hold the PDA in place, not that stable of an idea. I returned it. I wanted it to protect my PDA not sratch it."
5,"This Group is AWESOME! Great Tunes, Heart-felt lyrics.","If there was ever a group that you need to check out, it's this one! These guys are REAL. Real people, real life situations, real HOPE. Check them out, your life will be touched by their sencerity, and best of all, the MUSIC IS AWESOME! Looking for new tunes with a positive message..check them out: SEVENTH DAY SLUMBER!"
3,Mares Tropic Low Dive Boot,"Ordered a size too big for my feet so will wash them to get some shrinkage, but should be a good boot to stroll around in when not diving"
1,a pumpkin!!,"call me stupid, immature, a ditz, whatever... but i really DON'T see what so great about growing pumpkins!! i mean, it's a VEGETABLE!! i'm probably going to get all these ""unhelpful note"" thing now, but please!! i guess it's kind of interesting reading about how passionate this person is about them, and how she ""overcame the odds"" and all that (which actually irritated me after a while), and i did start to really hate ceril (that's the only reason i read the whole thing) but when it comes down to it, this book is about a vegetable. not even one i particuarly like. oh well, if you like this, you like it, but you know what i think!!"
4,Good Summer Reading book.,"I thought to myself as I looked at this book. I hate summer reading. It's slow in the beginning, but it gets you hooked for some reason. Every girl can relate to Ellie whether you are 10 or 20. Her feelings and stress is so real that its like telling your own life story. Great book! 4 stars!"
5,Humor in literature,I found Joan Bauer's book Squashed to be a wonderful combination of humor and valuable insights into relationships. Her humor makes difficult situations easier to confront and examine in our own lives. My ninth grade daughter couldn't put the book down which is unusual for her when it comes to reading.
5,Funny and touching...,"Ellie Morgan's father always says to have goals. Ellie's goals are to help her beloved pumpkin Max grow 200 pounds in two months and lose 20 pounds. Joan Bauer's heroine is witty and determined. Each page has over a dozen laughs. Ellie wants to win the giant pumpkin contest horribly. Winning would mean beating Cybill Pool for the first time. Taking off 20 pounds would give her the courage to approach Wes, a new boy who is a grower like Ellie. As Ellie's pumpkin grows, she is faced with frost and pumpkin theives. Ellie learns some of life's little lessons, too. You will surely enjoy this funny and touching novel and love Joan Bauer's herione Ellie."
3,Runs small,You may need to order a larger size in this helmet. I have purchased a few helmets over the years all size medium. This helmet's medium size is actually a small compared with every other helmet I've owned.
3,Average,"This helmet is all around average. the padding inside isn't super comfortable and seems a little thin. the two vents on the top of the helmet are starting to peel off the main part of the helmet and I've only had the helmet for about a month. but the price was right and that's was the major factor for my purchase. Oh, and the one that I received didn't have the fuel decal on the front like in the image, just a small grey fuel decal on the back."
2,Be Wary - No replacement Shields available,"Overall this an OK product for the price, its not great but it gets the job done.The fit and weight are comfortable, however, there is very noticeable rattling and buzzing at higher speeds.It is very important to note that there are not replacement shields available for all versions of this helmet.I scratched my shield and called the parent company, Comfort Products, after not being able to find replacement shields online and not even the parent company (they used a variety of Chinese manufacturers to actually make the helmet) knew where to find replacement shields. So for this helmet, if you want a new shield, you have to buy a brand new helmet.I would highly recommend spending a few more dollars on a higher quality product from a manufacturer that actually supports their customers and stands behind their product.Do not waste you time and money buying this helmet."
2,Reprinted edition,"While a worthwhile book, this is a black and white, paperback, illustration-free reprint of the 2001 Baker publication ""The Story of the Old Testament: Men With a Message."" The original book is hardcover and contains many color maps and photographs.Christian Focus Publications has done readers a service by offering the out-of-print book, entitling it ""Roots: Let the Old Testament Speak"" (2009). Sadly, the reprint is far inferior to the original work and readers would be better served with used copies of the Baker title. At the least, please note that, if you own Motyer's ""The Story of the Old Testament: Men With a Message,"" there is no reason to buy this reprint."
2,"good product, priced too high","I recently bought this tone's chili powder because I thought it was something you had to order nline, I ended up paying @20 with the shipping and then was at our local Sam's Club and bought the same thing with no shipping for $4.99!!!"
2,Less information than the manual,"This book doesn't do much more than cover the most rudimentary functions and walk you through the ""experts."" Since the whole point of ""experts"" is they are simple to use, I don't think anyone needs to spend $20 to read, ""the Form Expert asks you if you want to use the data from one or two tables. Click the option you want and then click Next."" Duh!"
3,"Could not find data on ""TCursor""..Error message on Paradox 7","Wonderful colors, and I understand that it is a quick tutorial. I just installed the Paradox 7 for windows 95. I bought it because it (Borland) advertises that it is ""easy-to-use."" I have used other versions of Paradox. It is good software.The book is easy to use and I bought it because I tried to run the Paradox 'Expert' system and I got an error. nrecords error, (TCursor not opened). I could not find any help data on nrecords or 'TCursor' in the book, and also not in the help data of Paradox 7.Perhaps I am asking the book to explain what Paradox itself does not explain. If so, I cannot blame the book. It is well written and clear."
2,Paradox 7 complexities,"After 2 years of trying to operate Paradox 7, I continue to have the Expert system trying to intercept and ruin my needs. I installed the system on my pentium computer and the ""Expert"" system has never worked. I continue to get an error message. I am thoroughly disgusted with Corels theoretical ""support"" which is nonexistant unless I want to spend telephone dollars ( a lot of them) to fix THEIR system. A simple desire to add a column of numbers requires a PHD in economics and electronics. While Ms. Newbury may be a good author, there is no system to get help when it does not work.....Unless I want to spend more money trying to understand the Corel attitude."
1,Is this really a book for grown ups?,"This book must have been designed for 10 year old girls. I say girls as the use of extraneous and irrelevant colour disguises a serious lack of substance.Any fool can discover with little effort how to perform the basic database functions. What is really required from a book of this type is how to use Style Sheets across a variety of applications with economy of design effort. That is, how to do things the smart way without the plod.Unfortunately, there is a dearth of material relating to Paradox7 and one is driven to this drivel.Sorry to be so negative, but after waiting three weeks for this garbage, one is naturally disappointed.This is a blow for buying books unseen."
1,Not the CARBON MAC OS.X Ver,"While this is a legitimate Civ 2 disc/manual, its not a CARBON OSX version. NOT FOR POWER PC's or OS.10.4 or HIGHER.this is not stated ANYWHERE IN THE product description.Please Be aware of this!!!NOTE ALSO: this came ""media mail"", envelope with no CD jewel case. HIGHLY UNPROTECTED SHIPPING METHOD. No padding at all."
1,Don't be fooled,"Barry Sessle is notorious here in Toronto for doing painful research on cats for almost 30 years! He also does pain research on ""awake"" monkeys. You might want to consider the reliability and ethicality of someone who does this kind of work before buying this book."
4,Memorable Romance,"I read this book awhile ago and I thoroughly enjoyed it.The memory of it has stayed with me. It was the first of Ms.Lowell books that I read and because of it I discovered a truly talented author. I won't go into the details of the book because others have but I must say that the story was great and the characters were very well written.If you like medieval romances I would also recommend ""Forbidden"" by Ms. Lowell."
2,Disappointed,"It was hard to like either of these characters. Wolfe was such a jerk to Jesse, except for the last few chapters and Jesse was a pathetic heroine. Wolfe didn't care if she married Lord Gore or any other man, as long as it wasn't him. A little jealousy or possessiveness in the beginning on his part would have been comforting. And couldn't Jesse have made a living as a seamstress or something in America and not have to trap Wolf into marriage? The last three pages had a nice happy ending, but I wish that Jesse had made Wolf suffer a little more for all the torment that he put her through."
2,horrible-abusive-terrible,"Wow, I've been a fan of Elizabeth Lowell because she writes such strong female characters and it's the usual ""he took her again and again and she bagan to like it."" The main male character, Wolfe Lonetree [give me a break, we get it, he likes to be a loner] married a woman and then proceeds to verbally and physically abuse her for 3/4 of the book. It's all okay because after verbally humiliating her in front of people, he says sorry. Please, spare me. Plus, the female character internalizes the abuse ""My Lord Wolf has given me so much and I've given him nothing."" This book made me cry. It's horrible."
4,Only Mine,"I found the book to be a fun read. Though I became frustrated with the characters at times I found the book to be believable for the time period. Wolfe and Jessi were both people haunted by a past that life dealt them. It's understandable why his mother named him what she did because she knew the life he would have because of his heritage or lack of heritage being an illegitamate child. It is understandable that Wolfe hated aristocracy and that Jessi had no idea what a real marriage was about, since that type of society is very plastic and polished so that thing are not always as they seem. I could truely feel Wolfes pain as an outcast and a boy growing up without the guidiance of his father. I truely did fall in love with Wolfe. I also loved Jessi because she was so strong and determined to learn and to be a good wife and because she was so honest."
1,DID YOU MEAN ARABIAN DESERT?,How can the material be trusted when your title dosen't lead us to any specific location on this earth? Did you research your material the way you researched your title or did you just make things up?
1,Where is that gulf?,"No body of water by the name ""arabian gulf"" has ever existed. Quit using imaginary names."
5,A very complete album,"I'd recommend _The Winter of Our Discontent_ very highly. The songs express a range of emotions, tempos, styles, vocal techniques, and concepts. Yet, it comes together in a beautiful harmonious way. The opening track melds into ""Story of Our Lives,"" a hopeful banner song. Later in the album, ""Heidi's Song"" presents a beautiful romantic picture. In between, you're treated to a range of songs, from the dark overtures of ""Blind"" to the cheerful lovey-song ""Starling."" Though the songs are diverse in content & sound -- they come together well. The album closes on another strong point with ""Winter,"" a song (like so many EG songs of the past) sure to resonate with anyone looking for something more to life._Winter of Our Discontent_ is a complete album, and one that offers a lot for first time EG listeners or seasoned fans. Great lyrical depth (as always), coupled with emotion-filled harmonies makes this a top choice."
1,Parts3 is Misleading addition to the Franchise,"The original Parts was great and my youngster loved reading it over and over. Very funny story.This third book in the series appears it has gotten to the stage where they are trying to ""milk dollars out of the franchise"". The style change is a unpleasant surprise and now it is simple one line idiom's which the child audience does not find entertaining. This is not a book I can read to my 4 year old at bedtime since there is only one sentence per page. While some people may find the idiom's interesting, because it is a different style I think they should not have been misleading and included it in the ""Parts Franchise"" that kids have come to expect as a good read for bedtime.I feel like I wasted my $12 on this one...I wish I had looked at it at the bookstore instead of relying on the Parts franchise name and buying it sight unseen on Amazon.- JC / San Jose, CA"
1,Not appropriate for my child,"My 4 1/2 year old son and I loved the first two books in this series. I found the language in this book offensive and did not continue reading after the first 4 or 5 pages. If you prefer not to use the words stupid, crazy, and idiot in your household then this is not the book for you."
3,Not as good as Parts and More Parts,"My 2 and a half-year old loves Parts & More Parts, and begs for repeated readings. We got this book as an incentive at the local library for having completed a summer reading program for kids. I thought the third book in the trilogy would be similar to the first two, and was very wrong in my assumption. This is definitely for older kids, and though it says it is suitable for 1st graders, I think its more appropriate for those in the upper elementary classes. It deals with idioms, using the different body parts to illustrate the use of idioms, like ""Don't give me lip"", ""Can I lend you a helping hand?"" etc...though it is creative, there seems to be a lack of humor that was so apparent in the earlier two books in the series. Oh well, that's just my opinion...its just written in a different vein than Parts & More Parts."
4,Humor for children,"Hilarious! My kids love the plays on words & idioms. We laugh every time we read this. I sent it as a gift to a foreign friend who specializes in linguistics, specifically in American idioms. She loved it, too."
5,We love all the Tedd Arnold books,"All of the ""Parts"" books are so funny they make the grownups laugh more than the kids. The kids will need to grow up a little more to understand all of the humor but they still enjoy the books!"
2,"Ok, but wouldn't recommend it","The book is fine, I suppose with time I could learn to like it. I think kids will enjoy that there is enough detail that they can notice something new each time they read it. But I don't think its all that fun to read. Doesn't really flow."
4,a little known score!!,Miklos rozsa was allways great. This score has a great and romantic score that people have forgoten because the film has been lost in all the hype about Cleopatra. Listen to it. Its moving.
3,"Good, but not enough","Although there are some great stories in here, it left me wanting more. There should have been much more from the Stanley Cup winning and fun-loving teams of the early '70's.There are numerous grammatical errors that never should have made it past any half-decent editor.Lastly, in about the last third of the book, EVERY SINGLE picture has the wrong caption. How on earth did this make it to printing without being noticed?For [money], there should have been more tales and less errors."
5,WWJ come through as usual...,"I would definitely recommend this to anyone who can handle action, horror, and lot's of on edge reading. It keeps you going from start to finish and never get's dull."
5,Grade A,Good story by the author that kept you reading until the end of the story. Good characters and plot twist that will surprise the reader.
4,Romance + Horror = Interesting Read.,"This was a VERY good read. One of the few books that portrays cats in both a good and bad light. With all of the negative connotations - such as ""all dogs go to heaven"" ""cats and dogs"" etc, one would be out to think Cats are evil creatures. Johnstone paints them closer to being human, on both sides. That was one of my favorite parts.Very, very opinionated read.It has a christian view to it, although it doesnt seem to churchy. What with a dead hand ""goosing"" someone.It had me up late reading it - and while it's gory in some parts, it's still an awesome read. I'm currently looking for other books in this series.Dont read if you're too prissy, tho. Sometimes it gets a little grusome, and sexual."
1,Don't waste your time,"I cannot believe anybody would give this sorry mess 4 or 5 stars. It is horrible. This was my first and only Johnston book and I wish I had never picked this one. I know the Devil is around but this is so bad and boring, I could hardly finish it. read it if you dare."
1,It was not good.,This was one of the most horrendous. For short the writers I.Q. is p.u. No good at all This book literally sucked how could you write this you simple minded creature. I could write better when I am asleep. Oh the profanity I want to say toward you is not discribable in words.
2,Works ok but many are better,"These FRS radios worked ok but have a terrible, very hard to see display. The LCD backlight color is RED. Very poor contrast and hard to see display functions. Also since buying them I have seen many other brands with many more features for less money."
2,Not what I expected,"I was excited to receive this book after reading all of the positive reviews. The author does provide a lot of good visuals, but I still had trouble understanding her directions, even after re-reading them several times. Maybe this is just because I am new at pattern making. The styles that are copied definitely do not make me miss the 90's! There are other resources that have been more helpful for me in understanding how to make ""knock off's"". I recommend ""Making Patterns from Finished Clothes"" by Rusty Bensussen. It covers how to copy a lot more styles than this book does and gives you inspiration for creating endless styles from the basic patterns that you create. Another great resource is the DVD titled ""Copy Ready to Wear"" by Sandra Betzina. I have borrowed both of these from the library and enjoyed them so much that I will soon be ordering them from Amazon."
1,"""What Went Wrong With this Book . . .""","As one who would rather read good, conservative literature than watch the tube, this book was thoroughly disappointing. The concepts presented were simplistic, poorly researched and largely self-serving. Mr. Ankarlo should have worded the title as: ""The World According to Me"". I should have known that this book was going to be so full of self-promotion by the fact that Mr. Ankarlo has a large picture of himself on the front cover and a full length picture of himself on the back cover as well. Even though I agree with much of what Mr. Ankarlo presents, the lack of depth and sophomoric language rendered the book largely unreadable. Being a huge fan of Glenn Beck, I bought this book in large measure because he wrote the ""Foreword"". It turns out the ""Foreword"" was the only redeeming feature of the book. I will continue to be a fan of Glenn Beck, but I will think twice about purchasing books of other authors he endorses."
1,It's TERR-ible....,"Ankarlo practically advocates execution of anyone who disagrees with his viewpoints. He especially hates Jews, Catholics, Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics. And he exploits his son's service in the military for his own financial gain. His book is an advertisement to buy his book, advising readers that they can reach idealogical nirvana if they sleep in a bathtub full of his books.Why do you hate America so much, Mr. Ankarlo? Why do you want to burn the City of Boston to the ground? Every time you open your mouth, George W. Bush weeps. Every time you congratulate yourself for your son's military service, McCain cringes. Every time you mention your book on your show, Cheney nearly has another heart attack. And, yes, when you espouse your ""the Republic must fall"" viewpoints, even Ann Coulter blushes.Save us all the trouble and stay in your bunker without a laptop - so you CAN'T write another piece of garbage."
2,Not Waterproof,"I've had the Foretrex 101 for about 4 months and used it primarily for sea kayaking. While it has functioned pretty well over the period, it has now become unusable due to water getting in through the battery cover. Looking at the seal on that cover, it's pretty minimal compared to those on other waterproof gear I own. Would probably be ok for hiking and biking but, certainly in a salt water environment, I'd steer clear of this one."
3,Garmin Foretrex 101,"The battery life was WELL under what was estimated in product info. This is not a bad product, just not what I was expecting. I do alot of backcountry backpacking and found that the unit had a difficult time keeping a signal under tree cover. Once out in the OPEN above treeline, no problem. But what's the point if half you distance might be in treeline and it won't be able to track?? Battery life poor in MY opinion."
5,Love this GPS,"Long Battery life, great display, easy to use. easy to configure the screen to see the info I want to see."
4,Good Small GPS that uses external AAA batteries,"This is a good small GPS, but the Etrex Vista series (larger) is better for work use. This little one will do a lot for it's size. I've had it for a couple of years now and prefer it to the upgraded internal battery models due to direct replacement of batteries on the go.The Screen is small, but it will show you the basics needed or you can scroll through it. You can change the fields values on the navigation screen to customize it. The blacklight is nice and not too bright.It's nice, but not as user friendly as the full sized Vista model."
2,Seems a bit dated,"Was hoping for something a lot better than this. Display looks like 1980's technology, and it is pretty confusing to use. It takes a while for the satellites to connect & when they do, it is still a bit uncertain what to do next. I imagine there will be much better technology with much better displays coming out soon."
1,Weak signal,"I don't know if my specific product was defective or if it was a design flaw, but the ""weak signal"" symbol and accompanying beep were constantly coming up. I had intended to use this during mountain biking, but it would not keep accurate distance. I even tested it while driving, where I could compare the odometer reading in my car with the odometer on the GPS. Still, the Foretrex was significantly lower than the actual mileage."
5,boclair,Man this cd is unreal. I have played this cd several times and the people start to party as soon as they hear this cd. We were playing the cd at a football tailgate party and all the people were stopping by asking who was this and they started to dancing at the tail gate. Trust me this is one for all the party people out there.
3,pretty good,this disc was pretty catchy at the time it came out.Hey Mr.DJ was a jam.i liked their voices it blended well here.the music doesn't change much though that's what hurts it over the course of listening to it.but overall it's pretty good.
4,Music that's good for the soul.,"I haven't heard Zhane in a while and when I reviewed their title hits, I was disappointed that I didn't get their music. One person said they stink. That person don't know what real music is."
5,Definitely a must buy,I really like this cd alot because it has diversity. HOT tracks to get your groove on.
5,great read,"i met the author too. she is a very nice lady that has decided to share her life story about sexual abuse. it is a very interesting book to read, i think its a very useful source to understand the struggle sexual assault victims and survivors go through. Gordon striked me as a very nice person and i was very happy to meet her on one of her biking destinations where she speaks out against childhood sexual abuse."
4,"an accurate, full of examples dictionary","I do professional translations, and I have found this dictionary particularly helpful in legal translations. It contains many examples, key phrases and terms, which are of great use. In comparing it to others this has special advantages."
5,Healing is Hot!,I was introduced to this book at a very trying time in my life and found it to be of great comfort as well as providing tremendous insight. I knew I was on the right track when I noticed my psychiatrist had a copy in his office bookcase. He also recommends it highly.
3,some good tracks ...,"""Fall on Me"", ""I Will Not Be Silent"", ""Search Me, Know Me"", and ""Everything"" are by far the best tracks on this CD. The songs are meaningful and performed with great feeling, evoking a definite ""heart response"" within the listener. This band has a heart for worship!"
4,davidmahr does it again!,"The Lost & Found EP by davidmahr is an excellent sophomore effort from the southern Californian synthpop maestro. Five brand new songs written with SFoRcE (who also coproduced) and L. Deved Smith II (the man with the beeps and blips) comprise this excellent plastic disc. The album goes from up (with songs like More Each Day and Out Of Control) to down (with Rain), and in between with Never Alone, an example of pure pop perfection. This disc is well worth checking out, don't miss it!"
3,YMCA Healthy Back Book,"I'm sure many people would find it useful, but I did not especially learn anything new,so I was disappointed. Sorry"
2,somewhat outdated and lite on features..,"This is software from year 2000, and while there are not many inexpensive options for Mac users for CAD type programs ( and this might be one of the few options available).. It will make you cry if you see the PC bargain bin software like ""3D Home Architect Deluxe 3"" by Broderbund.. it's les than tenbucks and has ten times the power and features of 123 home design... When I want to do CAD type work is the only time I would really like to have a MS PC system.."
1,Quality Muscianship. Poor Quality CD.,"I opted for the CD so I could play it in my 2001 vehicle and was very disappointed that the CD was just a burned copy produced by Amazon. No liner notes. Just a printed copy of the cover with art work inside. I paid double what I would have if I had downloaded the MP3's and burned my own CD. I'm very disappointed that Amazon misled on what they are offering. No where does it state that this would be ""Amazon produced"" and not the original recording. Legally Amazon had to put it in very small minute print in the back bottom corner that it was produced by them. Very disappointing. iTunes, here i come. No more music from Amazon if this is what they are selling."
4,Lots of movies for a good price,"Good value. The case it comes in is a bit impractical for most movie shelves though, so consider switching the dvds into cases of their own"
4,Solid product,Bob's red mill is generally the way to go for GF products. I first bought this at my local grocery store and tried it to make sure I liked it. I looked it here on Amazon and saw that I could save (a LOT) if I bought in bulk. My only worry is that I hope I can use it all in time.
2,Save your money.,"Gorgeous singer, facinating personality, astonishingly awful biography. Facts are sparse, insight is altogeter absent. Fans will put up with a lot of garbage in order to get a little closer to the object of their adoration, but this is simply not worth the time. Save your money, buy ""Simply Dusty"" with French & Saunders, and have a laugh instead."
2,Very disappointed,This book was recommended to me. I just got the feeling as I read the authors just aded gisbrish to fill the pages. They could have put it all together in 20 pages.
4,Dusty was a Character,"If you are a Dusty Springfield fan, as I am, you will be appalled and fascinated by this book. Her manager and some ""friends"" tell everything she ever did, and how hard she could be to get along with. There is to this day a huge number of DS fans who continue to talk about her and admire her fabulous musical qualities. She died in 1999 of breast cancer after overcoming most of her demons. Dusty was known all over the world as a great musican, and you can still hear her voice on that diamond ad, in the movie about Enron, and once you get tuned in, you will hear her constantly in movies and on TV as accent music.This books has a lot of errors, but it still stands as the definitive book on Dusty. I sure hope when I die, my friends don't get together and tell everything I ever did!! Wow...."
2,Authorized??? Biography of Dusty Springfield...,"Authorized, I don't think so...This book, as well as being 95% negative, is very poorly written.It's difficult to follow at times, even rereading some of the long run on sentences...It appears that no one edited it before publication.Some of the ""facts"" and dates, even names (Dinah Washington is refered to as Ella Washington), are questionable.It does shed light on the seemingly very sad life of Dusty Springfield, but is the most poorly written book I've come accross ever."
4,Fascinating,"Many here do not seem to like this book and that's ok. I've always loved Dusty's voice, but of course there was a real person behind that voice and when you know what someone has gone through I think it makes you not only feel closer to that person, but to appreciate their talent even more. The book certainly covers her musical career, though of course not definitively, but also covers her life, warts and all. I have even more respect and love for Dusty after reading this. It was well worth my time."
3,Only because I love Dusty...,"...can I give this book 3 stars. Considering the fact that a pro journalist/friend wrote this, I'm surprised at how amateurish and unflattering the content is. But because I'm a devoted Dusty fan, I suppose I'd find *anything* about her at least somewhat interesting. There's really not that much to be read (or viewed) when it comes to Dusty, and that is almost more tragic than her life as depicted in this book. For voracious fans (who are able to forgive the sensationalism and appreciate Dusty's 'shortcomings' as a human being) ONLY!"
1,A NEGATIVE AND POORLY WRITTEN BOOK,"THIS BOOK WAS SUCH A LETDOWN. FOR STARTERS THERE IS NO CONTINUITY - IT JUMPS FROM ONE CHAPTER TALKING ABOUT 1969 AND THEN TO A CHAPTER ON 1972 AND BACK TO 1969 AND SO ON AND SO ON- WHAT A MESS TO KEEP TRACK OF THINGS. FURTHERMORE, THIS BOOK ONLY FOCUSES ON THE NEGATIVE AND HORRIBLE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO DUSTY - THERE IS VERY LITTLE ABOUT HER MUSICAL CAREER OR ANY HAPPY MOMENTS IN HER LIFE. PLEASE AVOID THIS BOOK."
2,Definitely NOT definitive!,"I have no idea how the word ""Authorized"" got into the subtitle. While it's entirely possible the two writers knew Dusty and were part of her intimate circle, they absolutely dropped the ball on this one. I have no doubt that her life was as troubled as they claim, but I'm furious that the so-called biographers often decided to go all ""coy"" on us. Why not name Dusty's lovers? Instead they use pseudonyms along with tantalizing descriptions. This perpetuates the stereotype that being a lesbian is embarrassing. Also, they'll make a statement saying that one song was probably the worst cover ever recorded in the history of the world -- and then not name the song! What is wrong with these people!? I hope to God that with the renewed interest in Dusty -- and let's face it, she is and will always be a legend, no matter how troubled her life may have been -- a truly definitive book will come out that will be straightforward and real. This one isn't it--though I wish it were."
1,Absolute Rubbish,This book if full of complete rubbish. Vicki Wickham should be ashamed of herself. She did nothing but portray Dusty in a negative light when we all remember her as the HAPPY AND POSITIVE PERFORMER. Of course i didn't personally know Dusty but to write such negative things is shameful. You should be ashamed of yourself Vicki. How can you call yourself a friend of Dusty? She knew you were going to do that to her. It makes me sick. This book is a waste of money and i don't reccommend it to anyone. I'll continue to love Dusty the way she was no matter what this book says.
2,Dusty Deserved Better,"Vicki Wickham would have seemed the perfect choice to write about Dusty, having been her manager & friend for many years. Unfortunately, that is not the case. While I don't doubt the veracity of what is written, Dusty was, no doubt, terrible complex. By focusing only on her darker side, it fails to come ""full circle"".This most revered of divas & greatest of vocalist, is still in need of a biography which would reveal the enigma that was ""Dusty Springfield""."
1,This was written by two friends???????,"I expected an in-depth look at the life of a very talented artist, Dusty Springfield. Instead, Dusty is trashed on almost every page. I kept reading and thinking that one day she would reach a happy plateau, but according to the two authors, all they wanted to convey to readers was that Dusty was a self-pitying, weird, unstable, self-mutilating alcoholic/drug abuser. I don't think I'll ever hear a Dusty Springfield song without thinking about the images that Valentine and Wickham left me with. Even the cover presents a haunting, almost unhinged tone. One wonders if Dusty was this miserable/high maintenance to be around, why did people stick around for so long? That is sad and this book is an injustice to Dusty's memory."
4,worth its while.,This book helped me understand other methods of closing sales. I was able to relate because I was in auto sales in the past. I think this book should be in every auto salesmans possession. Im no longer in auto sales but in takeaway sales. This book doesn't touch base on that type of sale. I still recommend to anyone in general sales.
1,Why car salesman have lousy reputations,"I got this hoping to find some new ideas on how to help more people get our services. Mr Girad is talked about quite highly in sales circles. I commend him for his acheivements. This book may work well for small ticket items, but I personally found it offensive. It treats prospects as if they are incapable of having independent thought, and enjoy being manipulated. The single redeeming idea I got from the book was how well he kept in touch with past sales. By the way...Since Mr Girad did so well in his sales career, I would recommend to him to hire someone to read his books for him in the future. His monotone voice is distracting."
5,Love,I love love love Cougar Town! It's one of my favorite tv shows! I can rewatched over and over and never get bored!
3,Great show; flawed DVD,"This DVD starts skipping on the 10th episode. We were unable to forward to any other episodes. A friend had the same DVD and it did the same thing, so it seems to be a production error in the DVDs.That said, let me assure you that the show itself is wonderful and we love it and we will find a way to see those episodes somehow!!!"
3,Better if Bette Davis had not been killed off so quickly,"Could have been a memorable movie, maybe even a classic, if Burgess Merideth and Eileen Heckart had been involved throughout, and if Bette Davis had been given a larger part. When Bette Davis was killed off the movie crashed from there. The other characters, Mom (Karen Black), Dad and child were dull, uninteresting and lacked charisma. I didn't care what happened to them."
2,Not worth the time!!!,"This was not what I was hoping for. The movie was a waste of time and money. Should not even be listed as a scary movie. Very, very poorly made."
3,You have to be accepting of jokes targeting people that speak differently to enjoy this book,"The facts are that only a Pole can make Polish jokes, only an Italian can make jokes belittling Italians and only people from the south can write books belittling the speech patterns of uneducated people in the south. The author lives in Highlands, North Carolina and has compiled a ""dictionary"" of tangled words supposedly used by southern people. Some examples are:*) Rough - the top of a building*) Rust - you should do this after working all day*) Putty - what you are if you're not ugly*) Lust - what you are when you don't know where you areThe level of amusement generated in you will depend on how you react to jokes that target simpletons and people that speak differently than you do. If such jokes appeal to you, there will be some humor in this book. However, if that is not the case, then you will most likely find it boring."
1,WHAT THE HELL TIME IS IT?,"Accidently put this on my wedding registry, I thought I was getting a Swatch. Confusing to read and attracts all the wrong people."
3,"Ok, but not great","Where the HELL is ALL OF YOU, her duet with Julio Iglesias? I am not a fan of his, but I ended up having to get his (overpriced) 2-cd MY LIFE to get this great song that Diana has left off all her hits collections!!"
1,Overindulgence,"A poorly selected,mastered, compiled and dull mess of recordings. A little something for her many fans does not add up to a satisfying collection. One of the worst boxed sets ever."
2,PULL IT MOTOWN AND START ALL OVER AGAIN,"I have been waiting for a boxed set from her for years. I am sorely dissappointed. It should have been five discs with one whole one dedicated to Supremes, one for 1970-1976, one for 1977-1981, one for at least 18 good RCA cuts, and one for the live stuff and current recordings. Track selection is nausiating and the sound quality gives me a headache. you might wanna pull it and start again."
3,Forever Undone,"I purchased the Diana Ross box set when it first was released. Though it contains all of the great hits of the sixties I was truly disappointed that the music was in mono and not stereo. My vinyl recordings are stereo, why not this box collection. Secondly there were many show tunes, and other recordings of vast diversity for Diana Ross that are not included here. This is merely a handful of selected songs not a prize collection."
5,Very Good Book for OCP Exam Preparation,"This book closely follows the OCP exam objectives. It enabled me to focus and shorten my test preparation time. In conjunction with my practical DBA experience, this book enabled me to pass the OCP Backup and Recovery exam. Thank you for making this possible."
2,very average,"this book is very average. i think that people are looking at their passing scores on the b&R test and just assuming the book helped them a great deal. truth is, the test isn't that hard if you study the general material. and sure, the book presents the general material... but it does so in a scatterbrained and unorganized fashion. the explanations of utilities such as rman and theories of restore/recovery are presented in a very ambiguous manner. (if you don't use rman, you'll have a test time grasping it's used based on the chapters in this book) plus, there's a lot of extra stuff that you don't need to know. sure, it's nice to know everything - but this book is for test preparation, right? the book is ok... maybe worth 3 stars. (and yes, i passed with a good score and i used the book) however, i'm giving it 2 based on the facts that it's ranked too high already, and it's pretty disappointing for a book that should be an easy write for a qualified DBA."
5,"This is a great, great book!.","I just passed my first OCP test today,3 hours ago. Before reading this book, I tried the free self-test sofware from Oracle and made only 40%. Today I made 90% or 54 corrects out of 60 questions in the real exam. Without this book, I surely will fail, especially at the Recovery Manager sections (18 questions) which I am not familiar with. Besides, thanks to this book, I found many mistakes I made in the backup strategy for our databases and corrected them. Thanks, Debbie!. You wrote a great book!. It helped me more than the 2000-dollar course I attended."
1,Missing features,"O.K., The sounds quality is great and I'm impressed with the startup time of the mp3 files but the lack of ID3 tags is very annoying. Also, a resume would be VERY useful to me, but i guess with a little memorization it wont be a problem."
2,"Right idea, poor execution.","I had one for about two weeks, then returned it for a refund. My gripes:1. [Bad] headphone amplifier. Far too much bass saturation. Got better as it warmed up, but never got good...2. Buggy software. For unknown and unrepeatable causes, this unit would occasionally (once every couple of hours) just freak out and play garbage......regular CD's, mp3 CD's....didn't matter.3. Skipping. If you sat still or just occasionally bumped it, it kept running fine. However, if I tried to walk with it, it would empty the buffer fast and start skipping all over the place..."
2,Ultimate Price tag,"Sure, Its a great thing to pause live tv, but it sure isn't worth what I paid for my new receiver. I've been a directv subscrber for about 2 years and love it,. I bought the receiver,..the setup went smoothly, but I had to call twice also. I spent a good part of the day playing around with it, and found that I couldn't schedule recordings of baseball cames that I get on the Extra Innings package until they appear on the program guide. (2hrs before broadcast) This is very frustrating because that is the main reason why I purchased the thing in the first place. I am going to return it, cause I cant see paying..[this much] a month for it. I will wait until more features become available, and the price comes down. It would be nice to see a Hughes reciever equiped with Ultimate TV, I prefer the onscreen menu's that Hughes brands have over the sluggish RCA, Maybe I'll check out TIVO and see if they're any better"
1,Terrible Product and Terrible Customer Support!,"I chose 1 star only because zero was not an option. I bought this product May 18th of this year (2001). I have had problems with it starting this month (Sept 2001). The reciever 1)has a faulty power supply 2) will not allow me to view local channels, and 3) randomly deletes hard drive recordings when the hard drive is not even close to being full. I called customer support to have the product replaced since it is only 4 months old. Believe it or not they asked me to pay more money to have this done. I originally spent close to $... on this product, which includes the dish. This is not good customer support. In fact, it is a complete joke, and i'll never buy an RCA product again. I strongly advise anyone thinking about purchasing RCA products to think again. You'll definitely be sorry in my opinion!"
5,Beats Tivo,"Bought the Ultimate TV for myself (w/ DirecTV) and helped a friend buy a Tivo (she knew the name and wanted Tivo, not any knock-offs).The UltimateTV compression algorithm seems a lot better than her Tivo (it's working with digital cable). She has a lot of pixelation, and even at the lowest quality setting, her 35 hour Tivo can't record as much as my 35 hour UltimateTV (?? why I don't know)I can't speak highly enough about UltimateTV.The graphics aren't pretty, but the UI is good.Hope this helps you make a buying decision. I'm back on the site right now buying another unit for my dad. That alone proves I'm a believer."
1,Don't bother,"Worked fine for six months, although the only feature I really used was recording on the hard drive. Then the unit quit. I called RCA and after describing the symptoms - continuously blinking power light, no signal - they said the unit was not repairable and, of course, the warranty had expired. They said they would send me a replacement unit for ($$$), to which I reluctantly agreed. They charged my credit card but two months later they still had not shipped the unit. I canceled the order and I'm now looking into buying a DirecTV TiVo. I'm happy to see that Amazon.com no longer carries the RCA product - probably too many complaints."
2,Slow and buggy,"This unit was quite a disappointment. The interface is SLOOOW -- it takes a long time for the guide to come up and navigate, and when multiple shows are recording the response time is glacial. It also has a lot of bugs. For instance, it keeps recording shows multiple times.I think I made the wrong decision on this one."
3,Very Scary Flick,"This movie gives me the creeps. I have to admit, that as a man in his 30's, a high school and college jock - I don't like clowns. But....this thing is well acted, and well done. It's really quite scary, especially if you can relate to the characters, which I could. Nah, it's not great cinema - just scary stuff."
2,CLOWNHOUSE/FROWNHOUSE,"This movie has it's little scary moments, but that's about as far as it goes. Kinda juvenile, but is watchable, once."
1,Horrible,This movie was horrible. The dialogue was just awful. The acting was really horrible which suprised me because Sam Rockwell was in it. It was so bad that I actually thought that maybe they had dubbed somebody elses voice in for Rockwell. The movie was not scarey at all. I could see it being more of a movie for little kids. I appreciate that it wasn't a blood and guts slasher movie that was prevelant at the time. But it wasn't even scarey from a suspense angle either. And it was lit like some neon 80's music video. I had seen a brief clip of this movie when it first came out on VHS a long time ago and remembered it. Then I read about the directors legal problems and his being arrested for molesting the child star of the movie and convicted. So I thought I would check it out. It is pretty expensive even on VHS but I got a copy for a reasonable price. I wish I had my money back.
2,Craphouse,"After reading the reviews for Clownhouse I decided that I had to add it to my horror collection. I bought it, sat through it, and found myself VERY disapointed. I have to admit one part made me jump,and I did enjoy the atmosphere but the idea was un-original, which wouldn't have bothered me but it wasn't done well. Three lunatics escape, dress as clowns and terrorize three brothers. I'm surprised I sat through this! If you're seriously considering buying this film, I strongly reccomend renting it first."
2,"Good Movie, Sick Director brings it way down","I watched this movie pushing the fact that Victor Salvo is sick out of my head---although it was suspensefull- the way the clows were defeated were sort of silly--as i was watching- I really didnt have my mind on the director and his sick past---but indeed that incident is in the past--he'll have to live with the thought he is sick-- this movie did not have blood, it was really not neccesary--if anyone cares- the man on the radiowhen the oldest brother is in the kitchen cleaning IS VICTOR SALVA--"
1,WTF?????,"i was going to buy this movie, until i read some of the reviews. the fact that salvo molested the 12-year old in this movie is horrifying. the further fact that, after this ""indiscretion"" for lack of a better word, the film starts to reflect this act....as one reviewer put it, he/she wasn't sure if he/she was watching a horror movie or a kiddie porn, is horrifying. but the fact that all these reviews highlight the sickness that is apparent in the movie, and STILL recommend it for purchase just chills me to the bone. what are you people thinking??? are you trying to say that, even though molestation did occur, it's still ok for the director to profit from it??? that, despite the creepy vibe many of you picked up on, the movie is STILL worth watching???? how sick are you people, anyway???"
4,I love it! It creeps me out,"This movie is so strange and creepy. The killer clowns are escape mental patients! YIKES! This is the urban legend you always heard, or never heard. It beats the hell out of modern day ""horror"" films. I was so scared for Casey, the main character, when I fisrt saw this movie. This is a must have."
1,Intriguing Premise Goes Nowhere Slowly,"As soon as I heard there was a film about escaped serial killers dressed as clowns preying on an innocent family, I just had to see it.Well the whole film is about as boring and predictable as it gets.Three young brothers are predictably left alone in their big gothic house after a trip to the circus where the clowns are slaughtered by escaped serial killers.The three brothers are extremely predictable. The oldest is a bully, the middle boy a nerd, and the youngest a scaredy cat who becomes the hero.If the clowns' goals are to scare the boys or hurt them, they fail miserably at both. The clowns aren't scary since only we the audience see them. They remain hidden from the boys. And when the clowns do attack, the last 15 minutes of the film, we get the standard silliness of a 10 old boy being able to throw a grown man through a wooden window to his death 10 feet off the ground.There is not a single redeeming fact about this film. Avoid it at all costs!"
3,awesome for bad movie night,"If you like to sit with a group of friends and poke fun of the movie, then this is one to have. It's to bad MSTK never did this one"
4,Hot girl book,"Leslie rocks. I grew up in the fifties, but never found a woman like her. Les uses sex as a metaphor, however unaccustomed, for the time and place. She recreates the comic horror of growing up and becoming sexually aware at a boarding school.I liked the honesty and edge of the book and look forward to visiting Les in college in some later work. /s/ Jose"
5,great scope,"this thing is great. very durable, accurate, cheap. it comes with everything you need to mount it on your gun. makes shooting a lot easier and more fun. buy it now!"
1,gamo scope,Absolute piece of junk the cross hairs broke after shooting it only 15 times. I bought this scope to replace the one that came on my gamo rifle cause it would not stay zeroed in. My opinion gamo is cheap junk
2,Cheap quality,This scope came with my Gamo silent stalker. I went through 3 scopes and all had the same problem. It starts falling apart only after 100 pellets. The front lens just starts to unscrew itself. I gave up and tried putting locktite on the front lens. Now it's solid but the picture is not clear anymore. Guessing it's now falling apart internally. Don't buy this scope for any powerful air gun.
5,"Written by THE expert and helpful, understandable","This book is reassuring and understandable, not written in professional language that one has to translate. I definitely recommend it.The Bipolar Child: The Definitive and Reassuring Guide to Childhood's Most Misunderstood Disorder -- Third Edition"
3,"Comprehensive, professional, remote.","Dr. Papalos has assembled a comprehensive set of facts and perspectives about bipolar disorder in children. He describes it as authoritative, and it is. However, I feel the authority at times more than his understanding. Medical explanations and references to research abound, but they tend toward the academic rather than the personal. His clinical vignette's most often rely on other people's work with children and parents. He is immensely informed, but is he truly experienced? I do not get the impression that he has followed a child and family over time through the vicissitudes of this illness and the social consequences it entails. His book is particularly thin when it comes to the interaction of biology with development and human relationships. Gregory T. Lombardo MD, PhD"
3,It was just okay,"if you are the parent of small children with bi polar disorder then this may be more helpful to you than it was to me. my kids are over 18 and i did not recognize the disorder when they were younger. i recognized some of the symptioms from the book in my kids, but since they are older the book really had little to offer me."
1,They do not know what they are talking about!,"These children that were portrayed as ""bi-polar"" suffered from severe psychotic and schizophrenic behavior. If they are also ""bi-polar"", it was not portrayed in the characterizations. These ""physicians"" may have wonderful-looking credentials, but they aren't worth beans. In addition, they have just done a grave disservice to individuals who are truly ""bi-polar"", and the public has been lead far astray from reality."
3,The Bipolar Child: The Definitive and Reassuring Guide,Found this book extremely helpful and easy to understand. Want all my family members to read it. It will help give them a better understanding of the bipolar teen in our family.
3,Lots of information,"This book is very informative but I found myself reading sections several times because it was a lot of information to take in. My husband had no desire to read this book because it was not an ""easy Read"""
3,An Informative Read,I bought this book on the advice of my child's physician. It helped me distinguish between ADHD and Bipolar disease. It is well written and is a handy reference guide but some areas do get wordy for the lay person.
4,The Bipolar Child,"This book is a must for understanding why your bipolar child does some of the things they do. We are raising our Grand daughter who is bipolar and it has given me far more information than anything I had read. It gets easier to be more patient and understanding when you realize that the child is not just being defiant and hard to get along with.Some parts get a little technical, but if you are dealing with a child with this illness you will certainly get your money's worth."
4,"Excellent book, a must have for any serious porter.","I was very impressed with this book. It explains almost everything what is needed to know to port Unix/posix applications to BeOS. The title is somewhat misleading though, this book would be useful for anybody who is interesting in writing applications for BeOS. The differences between Un*x and BeOS makefiles, C, C++, system layouts and standard headers are covered. Also configuration scripts (shell scripts), posix compliance and native BeOS calls. The author also gives quick overview of what tools are (and are not) available and how to use them. So, everybody from old Unix hackers to absolute beginners should benefit from this book. The only problem is that this book is already out of date. Since it's publishing Be has moved from the Metrowerks Intel compiler to the Gnu-based egcs, wich is not covered in this book."
2,"Too many words, too little time!","If this book was a movie, it would never be released on tape. The author missed a big opportunity by releasing such a superficial work. Definitely not recommended. Readers, please don't run away from the BeOS. Just choose your reading material wisely!"
5,The perfect graduation gift.,"College or work bound graduates will surely find this book useful. Far from a dry grammer text, O'Conner uses wit and humor to sell the idea that competant writing demands proper grammer."
3,Adequate,You'll probably find some rule you forgot about. That makes this book a worthy but not necessary read. Not bad.
4,To Infinitive and beyond,"The lamentable pronoun lives in the heart of this book (I have no idea what that means). This is a book about grammar. Now, before you hit your back button - this is a fun book about grammar. You may be asking ""A fun book about grammar, isn't that kinda oxymoronic (or just moronic)?"" No. The author offers a number of suggestions to correct one's grammar and does so with a sort of tongue in cheek sensibility. I'm sure I'm won't abandon my 'Handbook for Writers' that I've had since college, but WII does the job for which it was intended - to provide an easy to understand guide to better english for the average yokel (ie. me)."
2,Even the title's grammar is wrong,"What respect can one give to a grammar reference whose title is wrong? Was Shakespeare wrong to say ""Woe is me""? No! Anyone who knows anything about grammar and the history of the English language also knows that this ""me"" is not a predicate nominative but a remnant dative-case form from Middle English. The sentence does not mean ""I am woe."" Absurd. The sentence means, ""Woe is [to] me,"" i.e. ""The woe is mine."" Compare the German idiom, ultimately from the same source, ""Weh ist mir."""
1,"Well, try these instead","In response to Chinamunk's comment below that critics of ""Woe Is I"" offer nothing instead, let me assist those who cannot use Amazon.com's fine Search functions by recommending the following texts. ""Woe Is I"" is a problematical reference at best and should be the foremost resource in no one's library. Use with caution and in conjunction with the following texts that are all for sale here at Amazon.com, too:http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198691262/ Fowler's Usagehttp://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0877791325/ Meriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usagehttp://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060976519/ The Language Instinct (full of all the wit that ""Woe Is I"" features--but with a scholarly, deep understanding of grammar)"
2,O'Connor provides mediocre book.,"O'Connor oversimplifies the grammar she is attempting to teach. Just how many times does she have to write about they're, their and there? It seems that she repeats herself throughout many of her chapters. I expected this book to provide a challenge for me, instead it was just confirming things I already knew. This is truly for the grammarphobe, one who has little grasp of writing correctly. She does point out some good things though. One example is that someone can get away with more errors in speaking than in writing. She also addresses the fact that some of us learned incorrect English as spoken English."
1,"Simplistic, incorrect advice in a pretentious form","This book is full of bad advice that unfortunately will be adopted by an ignorant and unsuspecting public. It is a sloppy piece of work with neither a consistent style (now rules-for-rules'-sake, now anything-goes) nor an apparent purpose other than the author's self-aggrandisement.One wonders from the author's petulant attempts at humour whether her title is intended to be tongue-in-cheek. But there is no indication of that in the text. _Woe is me (thee, him, her, it, us, you, them)_ is correct; *_Woe is I_ is not. This construction is left over from the days when English distinguished the dative from the accusative and authors of grammars knew what case was."
1,Misleading authority on grammar leads to naught,"While indeed witty, the writer has but the most superficial understanding of grammar and perpetuates some of the oldest grammatical non sequiturs in the English language. To say nothing of the fact that ""Woe is me"" is perfectly correct English--and has been since ""English"" as a concept came to be more than 1000 years ago. Read and laugh, but do *not* rely on this text for any understanding of grammar. You'll make a fool of yourself eventually."
2,Not for serious students of language.,"There is useful information in this book. However, O'Conner merely glosses over rules and examples without explaining why these rules exist, or the correct labels of the rules. When she does correctly label rules, she does so parenthetically. For example, ""(a grammarian would say ""subjunctive mood"" here).""This is not a text for people who wish to learn the correct terms, rules, and labels for language. While O'Connor does provide general information and rules on grammar, it relies heavily on ""cute"" or colloquial explanations in an attempt to catch the reader's interest. In that sense, the book does reach its goal (""The Grammarphobe's Guide to Better English in Plain English""), but a little more precision with language would be appreciated."
5,Great,"This is a fantastic resource: a grammar book that's both clear and entertaining (I know!). I read it cover to cover, realized I had been making some grammar mistakes all my life, and plan to keep it permanently on my desk."
1,Insulting,"I found this book to be incredibly insulting to my knowledge. While O'Connors certainly knows how to entertain, she does the English language no favors in Woe is I. Her style of writing is poor to say the least, and the content in even worse. I would not recommend this book to anyone who truly wants to perfect their understanding of American- English grammar."
3,A good expose on Nasca Lines,"Aveni, though he has done a good job on the Nasca lines, rambles on aimlessly ""parading"" his knowledge about South America generally! He should have stuck to the point viz. Nasca and give us his views on Incas and Aztecs in another book! It becomes a punishment to read those useless pages! This has been the common complaint of other reviewers also! If he wants to make a thick book, there are better ways to do this!"
1,the first bag was good and the rest were bitter!!,"I bought 5 bags of it thinking it would be great for working out, energy and it's protein and mineral content. The first bag I opened was okay and I could tolerate it in shakes and sprinkled on food with hemp protein powder. But when I opened the next few bags and shared it with a friend we both horrified from it's bitter and nasty taste. I don't know if I just got a bad batch of this stuff. I would only try one bag of it becausew now i am stuck with 5 bags of it!!"
1,Get the capsule!!,"My review is not to say the powder can't do wonderful things but the taste is seriously not a joke. I read the other reviews saying the stuff tasted horrible but I figure some people are just like that, I wasn't expecting for it to be great. I tried mixing it with multiple things but there was just nothing that could make it ok. Just ordered the capsule, I am excited for it to come. Anyways, hope this helps."
1,taste awful,"I wish I could return it. Awful taste, ready to throw it in trash. don't waste your money on this."
1,sssttiiinnnnnkkkkkkyyyy!!,This stuff stinks ssssoooooooo bad! It made me stink too. I smelled just like the stinky stuff. It poured out of me like cheap parfume.
4,Not for first time users,"Fast shipping and a great quality product. However, if this is your first experience with Maca powder, then I would advise that you either buy the pill form or the gelatin version. This is an uncooked, raw powder and although it is a high quality product, it does have a distinctive taste and consistency. It is a bit tricky to mix into beverages or just stir into your morning yogurt."
3,Nothing earth-shattering to report.,"This is by far, the worst smelling, worst tasting supplement known to man. It is so far worse than anything GNC sells. I can't believe that people would mix this with a smoothie. I mix 3 tablespoons with about 3oz of water and down it while holding my breath and immediately chase it with something like orange juice. Does it work? I have no idea. Tough to tell. I'll give it another month and see. The price is right though, to at least try it out. I won't buy another bag of this foul powder though, I'll try the pills...."
1,Couldn't get it down...,"Drinking it once was bad enough, I'm sure I couldn't get it down ever again. I wish I could drink it for the nutritional value, but may try the capsules instead."
1,Tastes Terrible,"I tried many ways to use this product, but it tastes so bad I couldn't use it. Oatmeal, in a drink, whatever I tried, I couldn't get away from the putrid taste. So I don't know if it works or not."
1,Broke out in hives,I would not reccomend this product at all. Broke out in hives both times i tried it. They advertise using maca powder in the Nutribullet recipe book but from my experience and other reviews below i would think twice about ordering this as there are no returns.
1,Severe stomach aches after 3 days - will try the gelatinous sort,I accidentally purchased this product because I didn't carefully read the reviews discussing raw vs. gelatinized first. If you want to avoid 2 days of pain (even post cessation) then avoid this product unless you plan to cook it.
5,I love me some MACA!,"Maca is great for most people! We are over stressed, burnt out and fatigued. For some people Maca can be too stimulating for your system, but lots of people can benefit from its qualities. This is a high quality product and enjoyed in our house."
3,do research first,"before you buy this, make sure you do your research first. it may be potent- good and bad for you."
1,"Maca, Yucka!","I thought I'd try this stuff since it got so many positive reviews. Unfortunately, to me, it does not taste good either by itself or blended with something else. I tried it in a berry smoothie and blended it into a green tea latte, and sadly, neither was positively augmented. It does have a unique taste as other reviewers have suggested, it just isn't a GOOD taste. I'm guessing a spoonful of powdered dirt would not taste much worse than a spoonful of this. And the flavor is too overpowering. You cannot sneak this into a smoothie without noticing it. I'm glad I tried it, just disappointed I don't like it."
4,pretty good stuff,"This was my first foray into maca as food. There is definitely a taste to maca which I am not accustomed to yet, and it can easily overpower some things with which I've combined it. I've learned to go easy on the amount I'll add to pancakes or breads, though it's important to note that it combines differently with various other foods. One friend said she thought it combined very well with a zucchini drink that she makes. I've also had some success in combining it with cacao, but again I overdid it at first. Go easy to begin with."
5,great product!!,did some research on maca root on the web.bought about 2 weeks ago.i take1 tbl spoon a day and have notice alot more energy almost within 10-15 of taking the product.it does taste not so good but i will continue to take thisproduct.
5,"Excellent value, great product!","This is an excellent maca brand. To make a great raw smoothie, take the powder and blend with 1 banana, 1 tbsp raw cacao nibs (the same brand carries a great product) and 1 tbsp raw almond butter & tahini. Blend with ice and a little water. Very nutritional, and you don't even taste the maca."
4,Taste Test,Please do not let the reviews here that say the taste is awful keep you from getting this product. I recieved it yesterday and was very concerned it would taste and smell awful because some people said it did. This is not the case. It smells okay to me and the taste is not bad at all. I was able to taste it right off the spoon dry and it was was not horrible at all but actually quite pleasant. Too soon to rate as far as effects but wanted to let people know they did not need to be scared of the taste.
3,Its ok,"Tastes fine, i didn't really notice any difference when taking it but i'm sure it is probably healthy. I don't notice a difference when i take a multivitamin."
4,Good stuff,"I agree, its really hard to swallow with just water. But the benefits outweight the taste. Its definately not something you take your time to sip. It is manageble with a smoothie. I am buying a 2nd bag."
5,Super food for Women,Just recently started with this product...has alkaloids that promote balance to endocrine system...it has worked fantastically for my menopausal symptoms.Also gives energy...like time released and curbs the apetite...I will continue with this product indefinitely.
1,Made me VERY sick,"I have used other brands of Maca with no problem. This one made me very, very sick to my stomach with pain and nausea. It took me a few weeks to isolate what was making me sick - had a full gastro work-up and everything - that's how sick I was! Today, after being healthy again for 2 months I tried 1/2 tsp of maca to test and am sick and nauseous.I know many people take maca with no problems. I only post this so those who get sick will hopefully not struggle as long as I did to figure out what is causing it."
4,Healthy!,I love the convenience of having it delivered to my door at an excellent price. I include this in my green juices every day for the wonderful antioxidants.
3,no benefits that I can see,My shakeology has maca in it so I will no longer be purchasing maca. Maca is supposed to provide increased energy and libido which I have not noticed while using it.
3,The bag was damaged in shipping,"This is a pretty good product if you are trying to eat a healthy diet, this is great. I decided to order it from amazon after reading a lot of great things about Maca powder.The package I received was beat up and dirty. Otherwise no complaints."
5,I like,I have never tried any of the products but I like this and I do feel more energetic so I did also make other dietary changes but ido feel like this is helping also
4,It's supposed to be a good product,"I have read all the benefits of maca, and love th idea of using it. I used to add it to my morning smoothies. However I have just read from one of the reviews that the root (this product) should not be eaten raw. Hmmm. I didn't know that! If that's the truth, I don't have any use for it, as I rarely cook anything with heat. I was getting it for my breakfast, which I just mix into a smoothie.I also went online and found this: Maca contains glucosinolates, which can cause goitres (enlargement of the thyroid gland) when consumed in high volume in combination with a diet low in iodine.So, apparently, if you have thyroid problems, don't use it, I guess. Giving it a good rating just because of all good things it does for us. Nut now I am not sure I will be adding it to my diet..."
3,"Priced better then pills, tastes terrible","Although it is cheaper to buy then the pills it tasted terrible even mixed in a shake. I haven't noticed any real change in energy but it has been cleaning my colon out, although I am not sure that is a good thing."
5,Fuel for feeling great,I use this in my juice and it makes me feel really good. It's hard to describe because it's not like a diet pill or something where you feel it kick in and you're up and then crash later...with this you just feel good. If I skip a day I am not dragging and I just feel it has assisted my overall health.
1,The subtle but strong smell was overbearing!,"I am guilty of not listening to other reviewers' warnings about the horrible smell. I bought it thinking I could overcome the smell given the health reputation of macca. But I was wrong. I could not get rid of the smell no matter how hard I tried to mask it. Plus, I researched some more and found out that there isn't any hard evidence backing up the health claims of macca. Too bad I have a pricey bag of powder sitting in my freezer!"
5,Surprisingly sweet,"Not nasty like a lot of people said it wasdunno know about the health benefits (or the dangers as some people say :-/ )I only rate it 5 star due to flavor since its definitely manageableI add it toScivation Xtend Intra-Workout Catalyst, Watermelon Madness, 375 Gramsso i can drink it down easier. I figure to add it to my diet anyway i can"
2,"Good product, poor packaging",Half of the bag was all inside the mailing box due to poor packaging. The product itself is good though.
4,Sunforce 50044-60 watt solar kit,"Good quality, works well with the pumps that I am using for my pond. Easy to set up, I like the frame/stand for the panels. I am running everything by solar power! The only problem is that the power converter that came with the kit stopped working, so now I have to contact the company and get a new one."
1,too expensive,"even $250 still too expensive, average sunshine/day 10 hours, than you can get 60w*10*365=219Kw per year, 10years you can get 2190Kw ,if some days rings, you can get the power from the Solar Battery, right now ,per KW power cost about $0.1~$0.15, means after 10years (evey day is sunshine), you still can't get the money back from the Solar Battery."
1,Mark,"I can't rate the solar panels yet, because I haven't hooked them-up. I'm still looking for information to see if I can connect the solar panels directly into my 600 Watt Duracell thingy/battery with built-in inverter. I don't want to break my stuff. Sorry. But once I do, I will come back and tell you people about it. Is there a place we newbies can go and find-out how to hook-up these type of stuff? I have an idea, but not sure."
5,Temporary installation,"All items arrived quickly and in good shape. Installed in the backyard and charging a new DieHard battery with wires going thru a window. I called temporary installation because is intended as a minimum source of power for a 60 watts TV, modem and router, a lap top and a window fan, just a back up for power failures very common in Florida in the hurricane season.When the season is over I will make a permanent installation in a shed and running a wire from the inverter to the house to have some AC to power some devices. I will provide a picture then.Maybe I will see a small drop in the monthly bill. I recommend this product. Good value and performs as advertised."
5,Sunforce 50044 60 - Watt Solar Charging Kit,"We assembled the frame and panels easily. The instruction booklet was not well written, and a little vague. We tried it out for the first time over the 4 day Labor Day holiday. The dry-camp site was deep in the NM mountains with 15 others in the group. We were able to keep the 2- 6 volt batteries that were connected 100% charged. It was a big hit and we had lights when others had to conserve. Glad we purchased it, some of our buddies are getting one after seeing it."
3,One of them cracked 2 years later,It's been 2 years from the time I put them up and I was looking at buying another set to give me more power until yesterday when I was up on my roof cleaning them I found a crack on one of the panels frames. After 2 years they should have not cracked. they should have used a stronger material when making these. Also every screw they gave rusted really badly. If I didn't pay 1 seventy 9 on flebay after shiping I would have been more upset. This system is not worth the amazon price. Should have known being it's made in CHINA
1,"It works but not really, so i recommend standard solar panel.","Where should i start. Don't buy this. think of last time you got something as a kit and it was good, I can't. The inverter is useless. you cant run anything on it. The PVC frame is fragile and will break in couple of years. The wires are not sufficient for anything useful. I love amazon but if you want good solar panels this is not the place. Juust buy one 100W solar panel for like $300(google it) and spent another 200 on the brackets, wires, inverter."
1,Horribe Experience!,"Be aware, this product ships in a tissue paper thin cardboard box. When I received the package, it looked as though it had been dropped out of an airplane. I am amazed that SunForce would even consider shipping their products across the country in such sub-standard packaging. Not only is the cardboard cheap, thin and fragile, the box seams are not even taped.If you order from SunForce be prepared to open immediately and inspect every part for damage."
2,A lot space for 60watts,"There is 100watt single piece panel for $300, this one is more for like kids to pay with. If you want to invest into this alternative option go with the more powerful panels."
5,Sunforce 50048 60-Watt Solar Charging Kit,"I purchased this product at Amazon.com after weeks of intensive research over the internet. From the standpoint of being a newby at solar, I picked this kit for ease of assembly, quality of materials, and best price. I was very impressed with the way that it came packaged: lots of pictures, and instructions in English and Spanish, and lots of information printed on the box and in the instructions. Assembly went well. I can comfortably recommend this kit for even the most inexperienced skilled person. The hook up could be a little tricky, but if you do your research, and find diagrams of how systems are wired, you should be up and producing in a short time, for me it was about 3 hours."
2,How can the sun fade?,"The design seemed good and the system to support 4 panels was ok, but after 1 year either the sun's output had diminished by more than 30% or these panels were loosing their omph. I was surprised at the change in efficiency in only one year. I run a ham radio on a 55ah battery and use this system to charge the battery. The first summer it stayed well ahead of my usage. This year it can not keep up and my usage is down due to a changed schedule.I am changing to a Mono Crystalline cell set-up."
5,Does what it says,"All you need is a battery, it comes with PVP stand, one leg was miss labeled and I put in on backward at first but it was an easy fix, has been charging well thru the winter , can't wait to see how well it does in the summer. Wish it had more watts but good deal with stand,inverter,cables and charge controller.Update 06/24/09 Still working great, even got hailed on. I did notice when moving them to put on a gazebo to run pump for pond that the bolts that it came with are rusting. You may want to buy different bolts, otherwise still happy."
3,"Good item, but old technogly.","This item is big and get only 60 watts,.. so I was looking for more. I invest $1000 for a Sanyo HIP 200,.. its the about the same size and weight but produce 200 watt.Cons, Old technology, big, come in 4 pcs, only 60 wattPro, good price, come with accessories, easy to buy."
4,Sunforce 50044,"I received the product in what appeared to be the original shipping carton from China. Although packed very well in bubble rap and Styrofoam the box contained two broken panels and a wire that did not conduct current. Amazon did a fine job sending me the replacement parts and provided a means to ship back the broken items.I would suggest that you purchase a multimeter to check your set-up otherwise, as was my initial situation, it is nearly impossible to determine the failure when your system does not work. After receipt of the replacement parts and testing I got the system up and running. It does what it is advertised to do...produce ""up to"" 60 watts of power. I believe it is a fine starter kit for small duty solar power production and projects. The price is comparatively fair and contains all you need to get started except the testing meter. Yes, as previously mention by a reviewer, the bolts provided rust very quickly."
4,one cracked but works,Easy to put together. One panel was cracked but still puts out full power. I can't return it because I need something now. I'm satisfied with everything (except for the cracked panel) so let's see how long they last.
2,It was a nice thought,"The kit was a good idea, but lacked in the follow through. This would've made a very good cheap starter kit as it includes everything but batteries. Unfortunately only about half of the panels produced any real voltage. I tried once to have it replaced, and it was replaced with panels that suffered similar issues. I suppose I could keep getting them replaced until they get it right, but then how would it perform after being mounted to the roof and exposed to the elements?"
3,Not 60 Watt Actual Output,"I've had these panels for about two years now. I measured the power output on day and I have a watt meter hooked up permanently so I can always see the actual power output. When I first received the panels I could only get 50% (30 watts) of the rated watts (60 watts). Unattended throughout the day the power will ranged from 21 watts (late morning good sun) to 27 watts (noon). I live in Hawaii where the sun is intense. There is always a reduction in power vs. the labeled rated power due to the way they test the panels in a laboratory (5% - 15%); but this was a bit extreme variance in my book.Keep in mind the power output depends on the angle the panels are to the sun, what temperature the panels are and what the sun intensity is (time of day, location, air quality, etc..). I measured at noon, in the summer on a crystal clear day and I manually positioned the panels while looking at my watt meter to reach the absolute maximum power, still only about 30 watts."
3,Panel Frame Holes,"The frame holes to mount the panels into were about 1/2"" to short for the panel holes. The frame should have been about 1/2"" taller."
3,box,Have not pulled it out of the box yet.I waiting for warmer weather.cant wait too get a break on elec. bill.
2,Another example of Quality Manufacturing from China!!,I haven't gotten a chance to experiment with the Solar Panels yet... I bought these to power a low voltage water pump for a hydroponics system I'm building and didn't expect the highest quality. But I'm a disappointed that while taking them out of the box the inverter is broken at arrival. Low quality plastic. As I was assembling the frame/ stand both T-Connectors for the middle support snapped. I'm hopping the Solar panels themselves function ok and plan on building a new stand out of quality PVC or wood...
1,DO NOT ORDER THESE SOLAR PANELS,They are cheap and from China the inverter is no good the connecter to charge the batteries is broke already. I payed to much money for a piece of crap!
4,"Nice solar panels meet expectations in durable frame, but the plastic rack you mount them on is flimsy.","These solar panels are good, put out rated power, and perform well. Unfortunately they skimped on the plastic mounting bracket - this should be metal or some other non-flexible material. You don't want to mount them on a board due to heat in the summer, but I'd highly recommend you buy some adjustable metal and remanufacture the backing for these panels."
2,Components broke down after less than a year,"Components broke down after less than a year. I purchased this product less than a year ago, the charge controller stopped working today. I will be purchasing a more robust charge controller and would recommend the same advise to those with similar problems to mine."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,SOLAR CHARGING KIT STILL WORKING AFTER A FEW YEARS OF USE. GREAT FOR DRY CAMPING.HAVE GONE 2 WEEKS WITH NO HOOKUPS.
5,60W Sunforce Solar System,I received the system quickly. It was easy to install with all the cables and necessary hardware. During peak sun days the panels put out 4.5 watts. This is enough for the lights that I am using.
3,Somewhat satisfied,"The panels are great. I received a sunforce 200 watt inverter, which quit working after 2 weeks. After 3 weeks, the charge controller quit working. I bought a new 1000 watt inverter and a new 10 amp controller and now things are good."
3,ok but spend a little extra for something with higher voltage,"Everthig came fast and in good condition. It is easy to set up but I would rather pay a little higher electric bill than use this to charge my phone and bluetooth. Anything more the box starts to screem. I purchased a 400 watt converter and the same thing happens when I plug in anything stronger than my telephone and bluetooth. if anyone has any recomendations please post, because so far I have found this solar panel kit pretty useless. I plugged a small coffee pot in and the box starts to scream. I read almost all the posts here before I purchased this thing and thought it would be useful. So far useless. Please post if anyone has any recommendations. I will be more than willing to repost a better review if it is something I did wrong or misunderstood. All the best........."
5,sunforce solar panels,I bought the sunforce 60 watt solar panels for my travel trailer to keep the trailer batteries charged and so far I have only had to use two panels. I used all four when I was camping and the panels did a good job in keeping my batteries up during the day.
3,Nice shots.,"This is more a commercial of beautiful places to visit than a nude DVD. Of course, there are lots of people naked, but in face-closes. If you are looking for nude films, this is not a good option. You will find some beautiful girls in topless and a wonderful ship, as well as lots of places in Europe nice to see."
3,Dream vacation,"It's a promotional video for a vacation. It's like sitting through a long commercial. Yes, it's a dream vacation. I can't afford it, but it's nice to dream about it."
3,"Weak adhesive on Velcro, no notch for clip indents","Works great as a shade, and blocks out all light from surrounding directions. Also keeps the screen from reflecting off the windshield. HOWEVER, the Garmin I have has a curved edge, so the velcro doesn't have a lot of flat surface area to use, plus the adhesive loses its adhesiveness (sp?) when warm. Had the shade about 2 months before the glue failed completely."
5,Performs as stated,"Very easy to install and works like a charm on my Garmin nuvi 855t. Got it just in time to use on our trip from Louisiana to Mountian View, Ar. Very pleased with this product."
5,Smokey is FFFantastic,This record set is the best music on the market. Smokey keep up the good work your fans love you.
2,oldies collector,"BEWARE!!! More than half of the songs in this boxed set are in mono-and many of these songs are available in stereo. I cannot for the life of me figure out why anyone would think that collectors would be happy with mono versions when stereo versions are available. Also, even though this is a boxed set it does not include all charted hits which is unforgiveable since so many of the titles included did not even chart!! The sound quality is fine but that is not the only factor to consider when rating a recording. I am very glad that I bought this set used because it is certainly not worth the new price."
3,Great Material but mostly MONO!,"I love Smokey Robinson and the Miracles and I love Motown music but when they keep putting out stuff in MONO that was recorded in STEREO and intended to be heard in STEREO, then they must not care very much about the sound quality of their products. Smokey, they dissed you big time on this one."
3,MORE MIRACLES WITH LEAD SINGER BILLY GRIFFITH,"THE SELECTION WAS GREAT IF YOU WERE ONLY LOOKING FOR SMOKEY ROBINSON AND THE MIRACLES,BUT I WAS LOOKING FOR MORE OF THE MIRACLES WITH BILLY GRIFFITH. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALL FOUR OF HIS CD,S RENAISAINCE, DO IT BABY ,DONT CHA LOVE IT,AND LOVE MACHINE I HOPE IN THE NEAR FUTURE THEY ALL WILL BE ON CD, I WOULD LOVE TO ADD THEM TO MY OLLECTION."
3,Not What I Thought...,"First let me start by saying I purchased this Boxed Set years ago because I have been a fan of Smokey and the Miracles from back in the day.. I purchased it again because sometimes when company came over a friend expressed interest in purchasing this item. Several times they mentioned it to me so I decided to purchase it for them as a gift.Personally I thought a lot of the songs were put on the disc to take up space, and other songs were left off that should have been included.I was surprised to hear so many songs in mono when I know there are stereo versions. What was that about?Overall, I was disappointed with the Boxed Set. I just wanted all of them in one place because all the ones that I like I already had.For a person who really doesn't know Smokey and Miracles music, this is an OK place to start. I just think the group could have been presented better."
4,A Venerable Idea Book,"I think I have bought this book 3 or 4 times in my life. It has been around for a very long time. I have never built any of the layouts presented within but it has served as a great idea book from time to time. That's really what it is for.This book first made its appearance before the advent of N scale but the tables have been updated. Each plan gives scaling dimensions for N, TT, HO, S and O. Try finding anything else with TT information!The sizes present range from simple bookshelf layouts and small plywood tables to large building club layouts. A good idea can be had from anywhere. The book is still around because it remains and will probably always remain a source of inspiration or daydreams."
2,Very Very Dated --- and Yet,"Linn Westcott was likely the best thing that ever happened to model railroad publishing. Too bad that Model Railroader magazine's present editorial people don't measure up to Westcott's standards. That said --- This book is perhaps a good thing to study if you're just getting into model railroading, but be advised that it contains very dated track plans. Most of the contents were published in Model Railroader in the 1950's and although a few have some excellent ideas, there have been so many new track planning concepts in the last half century that you'd be well advised to look elsewhere before adopting any of the plans in this book."
2,Not a lot of value,"Not a lot of pages here and the track plans are universal to some degree - making the book OK of you are looking for rough ideas. Bottom line is that beginners will benefit far more from this book if combined with some track planning software. There are far better resources on the internet for designs and concepts. Save your money unless this is selling for under a dollar or less, used."
3,Not the answer,"The book shows some good layout suggestions, but the author tries to cover every guage of railroad. A modeler usually works with only one guage, and is not interested in four others. I would have preferred a good ""O"" guage book only with some information on wiring, electrical circuitry for multiple systems, etc. A nice book, but not the answer for someone building a layout from scratch."
4,Planning made easy,This book is an esential for planning. It would be most useful for those looking to build smaller RRs.
5,"Love, love, love",After that used this perfume men slither by me ... I am the Queen of men by where I step.
2,Alright,I thought this product sounded much better online then it actually smells. I prefer some of my other scents over this one almost always.
1,Fake,It is totally fake if you know the smell of the real one....I was disappointed and you cant return this items coz they are considered as Haazardos :(
5,Bien,"Producto Original, legitimo, nada de imitaciones. llegò el producto que compre. sin complicaciones. recomiendo a este vendedor. Soy de venezuela. Fue un regalo para mi esposa."
2,Buy a Canon instead,"This is the SLOWEST camera I have ever used. It takes forver to write to the xD card. The images are very noisy (lots of grain) even outdoors. The indoor shots are almost un-usable. The only good thing about this camera is that, if used outdoors, the color and sharpness are good. I used this camera for 100 shots (mostly outdoors), but decided to return it. I got a Canon SD750 instead. Can't beat a Canon!"
2,Olympus vs Canon,"I purchased this camera because of the 5x zoom and the large display. I find that there is no viewfinder and the LCD display is nearly impossible to use outdoors. I bought this to replace a Canon SD-200 and find that it doesn't compare. I am very disappointed with this purchase.I wrote a review of this product over a month ago and am extremely diappointed that Amazon doesn't recognize it. What are your ""review guidlines"". a low rating ?"
4,olympus camera,I enjoy the enhanced version of this digital camera. It is easy to use and easy to understand. downloading pictures is excellent
3,FE 240 REVIEW,I really like this camera it has great options and the zoom takes good clear pictures.
2,Not Great Picture Quality,This camera is nice and small enough to fit in your pocket. It has a great zoom but the pictures turn out fuzzy. Even in decent conditions some of my pictures arn't clear. It is very easy to use but I would not recommend it because of the picture quality.
1,Too Grainy,This camera is a disappointment. It is very blurry/grainy on any setting unless you are outside in bright sunlight- then it is only slightly grainy. It doesn't even make 8x10 prints.
3,Great first couple months....,"I purchased this camera in late June and had the greatest luck. It takes great action shots of kids playing soccer! But as time wore on the camera started to not function properly. And I rarely use this camera and have been especially good care of it. It now will only take one picture at a time. Where as it used to take picture and you only had to wait one second for the screen to clear. But now I have to completely take the battery out to get the camera to turn off. All the buttons freeze up. Maybe I just have a lemon in this camera, because everyone else's reviews are great. Overall good camera for the price. But not I'm not impressed at all. If you are looking for a good camera. Go for a sony or Nikon."
4,Easy to use But....,"The camera is very easy to use, but the picture quality isn't great. I have a Sony Handycam with digital camera(1.5 Megapixel) which takes better picture (may not have the resolution).Overall a good and very handy camera for the price I paid. Amazon did a good job in shipping it promptly."
2,Great features! Almost worked.,I am in love with the card readers and the TWO USB inputs on the front!! But it never worked as a hard drive...Two separate computers (one running XP and the other Vista) were not able to find this hard drive within My Computer. They are able to find the 4 card readers but not the drive. I have exhausted all tech support. A replacement is on order.
5,indispensible,"this stuff is amazing -- put a tsp or tbsp in a pot of soup -- or beef stew -- or pot roast and it works wonderfully well. Can't find it in New York City so I have friends and family send it to me. Now that I've found it Amazon, I finally have a source."
2,Not what I ordered!,"I was quite disappointed when I opened my new ""Beef Base."" What I had ordered--and used before--was a dry powder. This is liquid that must be refrigerated after being opened. Even the color of the container is different--the one I received is yellow, whereas what I ordered is red, like the picture displayed. I am not impressed."
4,Fun Show with potential,"It is not the best show ever, but I do enjoy the story line so far and the acting is wonderful. Has a lot of potential."
2,Ordinary tv show,"""No Orindary Family"" rests its drama on the same device that ""Lost"" did - where we know what is happening but the characters themselves keep secrets from each other which imperils the others lives for not knowing the full picture. That is popular with some, but for me it is sheer frustration wathcing half-informed characters stumble about from situation to situation.Furthermore, the show doesn't knwow what level of seriousness it wishes to set. The crime fighting is pretty low-key, close to comical until suddenly in episode 10 ""No Ordinary Sidekick"" the daughter is seriously threatened by one of the bad-guys. It goes from light-hearted crime fighting to quite scary, bordering on disturbing as she confronts him in her own home.He steals her memory from the last three months and againd we see the family muddle about.If you like that kind of 'drama' in ""Lost"" you'll probably like it here too."
4,Sci-fi/Drama is dead!,"It would appear that there's no room for any more sci-fi on television! Really. ""V"" and ""The Event"" are gone. All that's left now is ""Fringe"" and now ""Falling Skies""! Falling Skies may not even get a second season let alone a complete first season. We'll see. Same for the comming ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome"".Sci-fi is going the way of veriety shows(extinction) and soon no network will even bother putting out a science fiction product. Not unless we pay for it ""directly""!"
2,Great! When it works :(,"This unit (in theory) is the greatest thing since sliced bread, you can record one thing while watching something else, record two things while you're not watching, and then watch stuff when you want, with the ability to blow by the commercials.That is, when it works.I've been through two of these units now and, in both cases, one of the satellite tuners inside the box failed (fortunately the software inside the box allows the thing to continue to work with just one). I don't know who's at fault, RCA or MicroSoft, but I can't be the only one with this problem.I got a second one because I (fortunately) bought the extended service contract from Circuit City, and, after 6 weeks, they and RCA couldn't fix the first unit. This time, I think, I'll return it -- it's now out of production, and, hopefully get something with the bugs worked out of it."
4,Awesome,Watch 5 hours of TV in 3. Watch what you want when you want. 30 sec skip button blows away commercials. 2 Tuners for price of one. Why 4 out of 5 stars. Slow processor make surfing sub-par.
5,Does what it says it will do.,"Great product, makes Directv much more enjoyable. We can now watch one program and record another. The hard disk recording has the typical disk over tape advantages; direct access without rewinding, instant jump forward, etc. We're now in habit of recording what we want to watch, then skipping commercials later during playback. The live re-play is used often also. And the..price was..less than the local vendor. Just a great product. some minuses: 1.) I'm not sure where to get questions answered, though there's some info on the web. 2.) once webtv is connected, it never disconnects. 3.) the disk is constantly writing, I worry about the life of the unit, but that issue isn't addressed in the documentation anywhere. But overall, we're very pleased with the unit."
2,I'd pass,I thought these sandals were not true to size. They run a little small.I also was not impressed with the quality. I returned mine.
4,His First Solo CD Re-Mastered,"It's got 7 good songs, the best one's are ""Killa Green"", ""Mobbin in Cali"" & ""Cruz All Night"". A good cd check it out."
4,old school bumpin,"if you like DRF and Sir Dyno, this is a a good one to have to your collection. old school cholo dark beats hence ""darkroom"" and just music on life and growing up en el barrio and i only got it for $20 on another site! ha!!!!"
5,Let It Play!!!!,"This, is a tight cd i give it a 5 cause of the beets and lyricsif u r a rap fan u should own this cd."
5,Great compression stocking at a fantastic price!,"I bought the Truform Anti-Embolism Thigh High Closed-Toe Stockings because I was having trouble with swelling after knee surgery. When I had the surgery the hospital supplied a pair of stockings for me to wear. My insurance would not cover them and I was charged $164 for them. They did not last very long and I needed another stocking.I found these after searching Amazon and other sites. I saved over $140 buying my new ones from Amazon. These are also a better quality than the ones the hospital supplied. Love them, Very comfortable."
2,Note to self- check reviews first!,"Gawd, what an awful movie. There, that's out of the way. The other reviewers have done a fair job at explaining why this movie is bad (LOW budget effects, didn't follow the original story much at all, etc). But what really puzzles me is why they hired Andrew Bryniarski to play Dracula. Up until now, most of us horror-philes agreed that the chubbiest vampire on record was Lon Chaney Jr's ""Son of Dracula"" (which I liked in spite of Chaney's being a well fed vamp). Bryniarski has about 100 pounds on Chaney. Tall? Gaunt? Corpselike? No way- this Drac's been to the ""all you can eat"" buffet. Now I gave it two stars because I did like the period costumes. I mean, I had to find something redeeming in this film, eh? But the others are right- rent it if you must, but if you buy it, you'll be using it as a drink coaster after you watch it."
2,What can I say?,"""Dracula's Guest"" is a prelude to ""Dracula,"" it is a shame that they didn't follow the original story line becuase this would have been a great movie."
5,The Most Confortable and Durable,"I have worked on golf courses for 10 years and I have tried all sorts of footwear. The Vasque Velocity line is the most comfortable sneaker I have ever worn. They also lasted much longer than any of the other leading brands. I own a Gore-Tex pair for rainy days, and I own a regular pair for other days. I also own a pair or 2 for chasing my kids around the yard! I would recommend this shoe to anybody."
4,AMAZING WATCH,"It was a perfect gift for my son, he still has it and it loks like new and work perfectly............."
4,"Skyway Sigma @ 26""","Excellent piece of luggage for a very good price. Frame is strong, compartments are spacious--expandability is a plus--wheels work well and have a good protective housing, zippers are strong, and the collapsible handle works as it should. Overall, this piece is relatively lightweight but well made and a good step up from a true carry-on or weekender bag. Enough room here for a solid seven-day trip, if not more. Time will tell if the nylon/cordura fabric will hold up--that's why I'm giving it four out of five stars."
1,Product comes with a crack from factory,"if you check the suitcase from the inside open the zipper pull tab in the gray part inside and you will see a crack with tape on. i got this item twice and it was the same problem, and they say it comes like that! WHAT A BAD SUITCASE!"
5,Works Great,I have used this for several trips since I bought it last year. Item was just as described and has held up great under the care of airline baggage handlers.
5,It made it from NC to CA and back!,"I recently purchased a 21"" Skyway Sigma 2 luggage for a trip from NC to CA and back. That bag was checked along with 2 Skyway Sigma 2 26"" bags. We also had a connect in Chicago during a snow storm in yearly December 2010. While we were in CA, we also drove from Northern Cali to Southern Cali and these bags hitched a ride in the trunk of our rental. They all went through a good amount of travel and made it back home in great condition. No issues to report for any of them. I feel you get a great product and great value for the price. I will definitely be purchasing 1 more 21"" and 1 more 26""."
4,As promised.,"I was very satisfied with this purchase. The bags really are very light, they travelled well and are good value."
5,great stuff!,"I bought this suitcase as a spare for the house. I sent my daughter overseas with it, and it came back unscathed. I didn't choose a very ""cute"" color, and it wasn't too difficult to find at the baggage claim area. I've just sent my son off to camp with it and expect to see it come back in great shape, albeit a little dirtier than when he left. Would recommend it to others."
4,Don't Believe The Idiot That Says You Can Take This As CarryOn,"One well written reviewer hornswaggled me into believing this can be taken on the plane as carry on. It CAN'T! Current 45 linear inch rule states no more then 22"" tall. Tested on multiple airliners (A320, 757 and 737) on multiple cross-country flights. GREAT suitcase, light, handle does seem flimsy but it appears to hold up. You can't believe all the information in the reviews you read."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this Skyway Sigma 2 26"" in October 2010. I used it in October to travel internationally. In May I again used it to travel and the zipper give way. The appearance is pleasing, but the zipper is very weak."
4,"Durable, not plane-friendly","This is a nice looking, light, durable rolling bag. Be warned that it's not a carry on -- too large."
5,light and rolls nice,Product just as described. I have had rolling bags in the past that were a PITA to control..This one rolls nicely without alot of effort.
4,Good Protection,The grills are durable they could of been 1/4 inch larger but they do what they are supposed to do protect the speaker. For the price they are perfect....
4,A Great Product,The grills came on time and they were easy to install and they provide me with the protection that I needed for my speakers.
3,Did not fit,"This seems like it would be a great product but if you have 10"" Alpine subwoofers 1023d they will not fit the bracket they supply you with will not be large enought to reach your box."
3,goos,good but the way my box is set up i can secrew hte qmounts in so i igh use gorria glues. it willl protect those bass cannons tho
1,Very Boring,This DVD was very boring. Volume 1 is much better. Do not waste your money or time with Volume 2.
4,The Devil in Texas Audio Cassette,"The books John R. Erickson writes and records off are fantastic and a true illustration of ranch life from the perspective of his hero, Hank the Cowdog. The Devil in Texas is a good story and should be reissued on CD. Erickson does an excellent job as a cowboy poet and story teller.Melinda Clements"
2,careful when ordering,Unfortunately these arived without the border. I also ordered cups (they came with the border) but one was broken. Pattern is lovely and these would be difficult to return. Will now have to look for a replacement piece. The extra plates (2 ) I ordered from another company have the border. Too bad I didn't order all of them from that company.
4,Helpful!,"This book was very helpful as I switched to a literature cirlces format in my classroom. It is written in a clear, enjoyable voice. I appreciated reading about the author's journey from traditional teaching to lit groups. There are practical suggestions for setting up groups, keeping track of books, using thematic sets, assessment and much more. Check out another book by her, Theme Studies. I used them together this year to set up my 5th grade reading and science/social studies programs. I'm glad I found them."
4,Great Release! Great Talent!,"This CD has 13 tracks and special enhanced features including a video to his hit Uno Y Uno Es Igual a Tres. He is a true artist. He writes his own themes and plays the guitar both showcase amazing talent. His crisp voice makes following his lyrics fairly simple, but if you're like me and struggle a bit with Spanish, the lyrics are included. As a package this album is great. There are some standout songs, such as Tiempo, Ahora, the title track: Ese Que Va Por Ahi, his first single and a double dose of Yo Solo Se Que Solo No Se Nada (they both sound almost the same to me). Although a couple of other songs ,albeit good, would not stand out on the radio. This CD is a very good effort by a young artist. The songs range from jazzy (Desde My Balcon) to funky (Tiempo) with a bit of salsa mixed in. This is a must have for fans of Spanish pop. This is one of those rare albums where you probably will not skip any songs, although some of them tend to sound the same."
2,Prefiero otra musica,"Compre el CD para investigar la musica de Jerimias. Prefiero musica con mas ritmo como ""rock and roll"" pero la musica de Jerimias no es."
4,Awesome mp3 player,"I bought this player mainly to accompany me on 1 hour drive to work. The car kit worked great. This will amaze you. My cassette player will not play cassettes at all. However, when I plugged in the car kit ""just for fun"" the cd player worked...I was stunned. All I can say is that I was really excited. The player took a trip with me to work on the first day out of the box.It soon fell into the floor UP-SIDE-DOWN. It continued to play and did not skip. I have never seen a product work like this product does. The ESP really preforms.The only drawback that I can find on this machine is no titles on the display. That could make finding a song on a 100 mp3 cd kinda tedious but, hey it plays up-side-down!The other thing I found on the player was the buttons seem a bit ""[less costly]"" feeling. The whole player is made of a [less costly]feeling plastic. If I were upgrading this unit I would make the casing seem more durable. However, after all is said and done...it works."
2,good but mine konked out,"It was a good mp3 player, you can select random songs and all the good stuff. After 30 days in my car, it just stopped working, i drive a brand new car and very carefully, so obviously it was not because of the shocks it received.maybe mine was a one-off experience, check out the other Philips eXpanium, that seems better than this one."
1,traedee,the cd player was a big wast of money.I can't even use the mp3.It didn't come with anything.no instructions on how to use or what to get for the mp3.I suggest you return the item right away.
4,An excellent clicker book,"I read this book after having read Alexandra's ""Clicker training for your horse"" and having been clicker training for quite some time. It is another excellent book with clear explainations, good backup with the theory of operant comditioning (in plain english) where required and LOTS of ideas for your training!The photos are taken from video footage (this is explained at the end of the book) in order to capture the exact moment of the click - so they aren't great quality but the purpose of this book is to act like a clinic where you can see moment by moment what is going on.There is something in this book for both beginner and experience clicker trainer."
5,Clicker training Book,"This is the best clicker training book I have read. It is very well organized and written to be user friendly. I would reccomend it to anyone who is serious about training their own horse. The training method described in this book has made the difference in my horse's life, he loves training."
5,Works great!,I love to see our progress using this technique. We (me and my horse) are having so much fun! Highly recommend this book.
5,THANK THE L-RD,"I have tried everything with my extremely smart straight egyptian mare. I believe in prayer. The L-rd wants us to involve HIM in everything, yes even the training of our animals as these animals are HIS, they are just on loan to us and we are accountable for their well being and if you are not humane & patient with training them (as they do want to please) you will be held accountable. CLICKER TRAINING IS A 'G-D SEND' and I can't begin to tell you how my mare loves to learn with this! If you want a truly POSITIVE, HUMANE WAY OF TRAINING, HERE IT IS!"
2,too small,"I have a X50 & x60 The case I have for the X50 will hold the camera,2 batteries and a sd card, This case will only hold the camera and a sd card, when you try in put a battery in with the sd card, you can not close the magnetic snap unless you force it. Not worth the money."
3,Johnny Gill once again pleases with the ballads,Johnny Gill has always been best at ballads and is easily regarded as one of the best balladers of all time. His follow up to his 1990 CD didn't impress me as much but he's in top form on track 6-10 where his smooth vocals and amazing range are best suited.
3,"Good effort, though not as strong as Johnny Gill","This album is good, but lacks the excitement of Johnny Gill from 1990. I liked the stomping feel of The Floor, the funky I Got You with Boyz II Men and the rapidly paced song Provocative. But my favorite is the ballad Tell Me How U Want It, which I still like to hum along to. It's really my second favorite ballad from Johnny after My, My, My. Very soothing and comforting song in its lush relaxing sound. The rest of the album is mostly filler and would have been better sung by an underrated R&B male singer struggling to get his single higher than No. 54 on the singles charts. But that's what it's like, when a stylistic artistically done song gets passed on by a commercially slick keep it to 3 minutes song. Johnny has made better songs than the filler that takes about 5 songs. It will take you days to figure this album out because of its unevenness."
2,"Poor construction, broken zippers","Looks cheap, won't fit my 28-200mm zoom lens or even the kit lens with the hood attached. The zipper broke the first week I had it and there isn't enough padding to protect the camera."
2,Limited utility,"This only holds the camera+lens and a few rolls of film. No room for an extra lens, no room for a flash, no room for an extra body. Get something else."
4,Good basic camera bag,"I was looking for a dslr camera bag to keep my new Pentax K110D in until I find a more expansive bag/backpack. I would eventually like a Tamron or something along that line but for the price, I want to be able to browse until I find just the right one. This product suits the basic bag need well. It is not huge or fancy, just a good basic bag. It has one front pocket that will hold batteries, memory cards, etc. and one pocket in the ""lid"" that holds a lens cloth or other small item. It accommodates the stock lens that came on my camera but I don't think would fit a much longer lense. For the price, (which was very reasonable) I would buy this bag again."
3,It works,"One benefit of this bag is that it's so ugly thieves may move on to a more fancy, trendy camera bag. People won't mistake you for a professional photographer, either. The bag holds the camera in the padded main compartment, memory cards and the USB cord in the internal pouch in the lid and a thin flash and spare batteries in the external pocket. To fully close the wrap-around zipper on the lid, one may be in the habit of flipping the brim of the lid back to expose the zipper. Over time this action may cause the synthetic material of the lid to crack, which is what happened to mine. It still works fine, though."
5,Better than expected.,"A very nice bag, bigger and more quality than expected.I could fit my Pentax k2000 with 18-55mm kit lens perfectly with a bit of room on the sides so it doesn't squeeze my camera too tight. There is a front area to store things also. I stored my filter case in this pocket.The only downside is it's a hassle to get the zipper to open because you have to pop out the front flap to do so. It's still not that big of a deal and other than that it's a great bag."
3,"Quality OK, but be careful","This product is made well enough, but has a really bad flaw. The lens goes in first ahead of the camera body making the bag top heavy particularly if you use a lens that is taller in size than the 18-55 mm standard lens. This means that if you pull this bag off your shoulder and have not zipped the camera into the case, but relied on velcro only, the case might flip upside down and dump your camera on the ground. This happened to me. If you are disciplined enough to be sure to zip the case before taking it off your shoulder, or to hold the case in one hand while taking off your shoulder, then this is OK, otherwise don't buy it."
1,Do not buy! Its dump!,"It is so unbalanced...it will turn on its head whenever a cam-body is inside... . I used with a K7, and cracked it because of the really bad balance of this package... warning: do not buy it!"
3,"Good construction, shoulder strap too short","The bag is well made and fits my K-x with 18-55mm zoom nicely. Inside top flap pocket for extra batteries and SD cards is nice to have.Only problem--the strap is too short to wear over the opposite shoulder. I'm not huge, but when I put the strap over my opposite shoulder the bag comes up to my ribs. The strap needs to be at least 10"" longer to sit at waist/hip level. Hanging the strap over the same shoulder isn't nearly as secure.This strap uses 'male' side release connectors on each end, most camera bags use clip-type fittings so I haven't been able to find a replacement strap."
2,A bit disappointed...,"Grey Freshwater 9-9.5mm Cultured Pearl and Peridot Chip Necklace, 17""When I received the necklace I was disappointed that it did not meet my expectation. The grey pearls have a dividing line through them as though the two halves were fused together. I have other peridot jewelry which I love. The finish on the chips resemble little fragments of unpolished gems...did not like it in actuality, had to return them, sorry!"
4,"Comedy, ethnic, oriental","An interesting comedy DVD. I enjoyed the routines and got some really good laughs. The artists do provide a different perspective and their observations are funny. Mostly they avoid ""angry"" comedy which is good thing. The humor is from observations they make, and poking fun at themselves rather than others which makes it easy to laugh without feeling you will be charged with discrimination. If you have insights into the various cultures of the artists, you get the additional ""insiders chuckle"" but the routines do not require anyone to have anything but a decent sense of humor to enjoy these performers. I have played it a few times and shared it with friends. The material does not force me to do a mental screening before sharing, but each adult should judge suitability to their own tastes."
2,When romances attack.,Don't buy it; don't even pick it up at the library. It's a disfigurement to literature.
4,The Teaching Of Little Crow,"I have now read The Teaching Of Little Crow for the second time, and would liken it to a great piece of music or painting. Angelina Heart, an exceptional ""words smith,"" has used her talent to blaze a trail to not only entertain, but also enlighten the reader with deep spiritual insight. Her unique mixture of romance, spirituality, inspiration, and creativity is both provocative and endearing.Although soul-mate (twin flame) love is a complex subject, Heart has created an enjoyable read for even those with no previous exposure to the deeper spiritual teachings. I found it so heavily layered that I discovered entirely new facets upon my second reading. I, for one, will be looking forward to further ""education"" in yet a future reading."
2,Disappointing,"A decent little movie that consists of lots of missed opportunities. Very gory on places - more so than the first two movies in the series. The acting is good, the story is okay, but somehow it just doesn't seem to work."
4,Enjoyable for the series,"I love horror movies. Good ones, bad ones so my review may be biased. I like the REC series and this movie is good. It is a departure from the first two, but are tied together (atleast in same timeline). Gory and the the action is good if a bit silly at times. If your looking for more of the same as the last two, then you may be disappointed. The movie is enjoyable for a horror outing."
5,Great watch!,"I love this watch. I have very large wrists, and have a problem finding watches that fit, but this one is quite large enough, in fact, I had to take it to the jeweler in order to have it shortened.It is a great looking watch for the price, too. Very fashion-forward, and I love date feature, which is hard to find on smaller watches.The Indiglo function is just another plus, as you can easily see the time in any darkened room or area.It's a tremendous watch for the price, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great looking timepiece at a very reasonable price."
2,"Great idea, defective product","When the factory-charged batteries ran out the solar panel would not charge the light. This was a fluorescent version. The replacement unit- quickly sent by Amazon -was LED. The same case and everything but with bright LEDs inside. I liked it much better than the fluorescent one.The second unit charged and worked very well until the charge was depleted. Then the LEDs would start blinking. Like an emergency light. Sunforce said that this was not normal behavior. I returned it as well. The light will stay up for around two hours, charge quickly but the blinking made it unfit for continuous use. A nice product but quallity needs to be improved."
1,Don't bother...,Forget using this in a shed as the light is hardly bright enough to see your hand in front of your face.It doesn't hold a charge for longer than a few hours (the unit I received stayed on for about one hour and the box stated three hours). This information was no where to be found on the website.I purchased this item to use in my chicken coop and had anticipated that I would be able to leave it turned on at all times. My plan was that it would recharge during the day and stay illuminated during the night. Not possible with this unit as it can't charge the battery at all if it's left turned on. In addition the unit I received had been previously used and returned by someone else (obvious from the packaging that it had been used before)... so I'm not the only one who thought this was worthless.Save your money and try a different product.
1,"Product deficient, poor quality and no warranty","Having read reviews that the fluorescent bulb was dim, I was careful to purchase the LED model. However, it is also dim. Barely produces enough light to keep me from tripping in my shed, not enough to distinguish tools and definitely not a work light. Very disappointing. After several days of charging I turned it on and only 4 of the 5 LEDs lit. I did not purchase from Amazon. Went in round and round discussions with retailer and manufacturer about warranty replacement. Retailer would only replace if whole unit returned within 30 days, but after all the trouble to mount solar panel on roof I didn't want to take that down. Turns out there is no warranty. Product guide says to consult retailer for warranty service, retailer says they don't do it. Finally got a replacement but was not refunded shipping and insurance. If you do purchase this product, my advice is to charge it up before mounting anything to test it."
1,Piece of junk,"Useless. The amount of light it gives off is less than those little LED Sylvania button lights. Obviously, this isn't going to give sufficent light for even the smallest 40 square foot sheds out there. A hand flashlight gives out a heck of a lot more light. Do yourself a favor and just buy a flashlight and leave it in the shed than to go through the trouble of buying this hunk of junk."
3,Happy with product,"I like the product, works as specified and the light lasts for a good three hours or more. Not as bright as I hoped for but at least you won't have to run electrical and you'll save electricity too. I actually purchased 2 and I should have purchased 1 more."
1,Not enough light,I bought this solar light to use at night to save on electricity. I was very disappointed. The light was very dim despite being left in the full sun all day and the charge didn't last more than an hour. I'll keep it to use in a small room like the bathroom and I'll save the charge by only turning it on when I need the bathroom lit.
3,Product was almost what I expected.,My only problem with the product is that it came with a rocker switch instead of the pull chain shown in the picture and my wife is unable to reach the lights to turn them on. I bought two and installed them in a large shed (10' x 14') and they give off a fair amount of light. I still need a flashlight for some areas but was not expecting it to be any better.
1,Did Not Help My Pet,This product smells fresh but did nothing to help my dog with her skin problem. My dog loved the taste and licked it off the minute it was sprayed on.
3,not packaged well.,"Ordered this with the shampoo of the same brand. They both got to me in a box that has a wet spot on it, because it has leaked through. Strong chemical smell. It works but only for a short time, maybe a couple of hours or so, then you'll need to re-apply."
2,Nor work with my dog,"My dog is mixed mini pin weighing 20 pound. Sometimes, she is crazy about licking her skin. So I want to correct her habit with this. but unfortuantely, it didn;'t work."
5,Great way to get extra vitamin c into my toddler,My 2 yr old really loves them. Would definitely buy them again. They have a great flavor & get my little one the extra vitamin c he needs during cold & flu season/winter months.
5,Good Flavor,I have been taking Nature's Plus vitamins for a long time. They seem to be a good quality product. The vitamin C chewable tablets are really good. They have a great natural orange flavoring. I highly recommend them.
2,Not what I expected,"I'm a long-time digital camera user who is taking the hobby more seriously now. I was expecting (and hoping!) for different techniques for shooting digital photographs in various situations. What I got was a book that gives me ""advice"" like keep an extra set of charged batteries on hand, carry extra memory cards, use a tripod, etc. All valid, worthwhile advise but not the kind I was expecting from this book.If you're new to digital cameras this might be the book for you. However, if you're trying to learn how to take better pictures with your digital camera I'd suggest something else."
2,Bland.,"The artwork inside is all silhouette like the cover. I would have liked the effect if it was only one or two pages, but the entire book is a black silhouette with a blue sky. It gets old and boring and did not hold my 4 year old's attention, which is rare for a book since we've read 2-3 books a night since he was born. The story is that babies crawled away and a toddler followed them and saved them, at least that's what I got out of it. It's one of those plots that is a little ambiguous. Either way, it bored both of us because the babies just crawl over things and into a forest, and the big child follows, then they all go back, and the mom hugs the big child. None of these adventures get into any detail, you just see them walking over a few pages of sparse landscape."
3,Not great,"I bought this book because the title seemed so promising, and the reviews were good. I found it too repetative and plain - not as funny and interesting as the oover suggests. My kids didn't respond to it either. I would not recommend."
1,Day babies crawled away,"I was so dissapointed after reading the 2 reviews on this book. The storyline could have been so unique. Instead the prose was made up of words chosen just to rhyme -in some cases, and not making much sense to a child. The babies were shown doing very cute antics, but I thought -as did my child - showing them as shadows, made it difficult to figure them out. It could have been such a darling book, with cute faces on the children, and the wording more appropriate.The idea was worth 5 stars, the content too dissapointing for more than 1."
4,Perfect Bedtime Reading,"This book is wonderful. I have twins (just under three) and nearly six year old. They all love this book. The story is sweet and the young ones enjoy searching out the babies, bats, caterpillar, butterflies, bees etc... on the pages. So when the story doesn't catch there attention, there is plenty to look for on every page.I also recommend 10 minutes to bedtime."
4,Captures Imagination of Even Small Children,My daughter is only 2 and this was the first non-board book that she was interested in. She sits through the entire story and even wants me to read it again. The fact that such young children are engaged by this story is a testament to its genius.
4,MP3's stopped working :(,"I got the EXP503 to replace my bothersome MPTrip player. So far, I couldn't be happier. A display that actually tells you the artist who plays that song #149 that you didn't know you liked so much. A resume feature that will pick up where you left off yesterday (caveat: batteries or power source must be connected for resume to function). Plenty of buffer storage. I ran 3 miles with it this morning with nary a skip.Bonus points for some rocking in-ear headphones that have some new BASS technology. Batteries are NOT included contrary to product description. I'm using NiMH rechargeables. The included car kit works as expected.Thanks Philips!!Update in Feb. 2002: The MP3s stopped working. Music cd's still play but the mp3 discs just sit there. So I've returned the player to Phillips for warranty replacement. Currently awaiting the new one. Rating dropped to 4 stars.Got the replacement model from Philips after a couple of weeks. So far so good."
4,Very Good MP-3 but NOT the best for Audiobooks!,"I bought this MP-3 player to use to listen to audiobooks thatare being transferred from tapes or CD's to this format. Thisallows the publisher to put up to 14 tapes on one MP-3 recording.When you use this player to listen to these audiobooks, there isa slight hesitation between tracks even if it is in the middle ofa sentence. By a slight hesitation, I mean up to 3 seconds. Someof these recording have as many as 70-80 tracks! So this can beirritating! Obviously music isn't a problem as each song completes a track!"
5,is that true?,.Is that true about the track name not erasing the previous characters at the end of it? like that guy said in the other review???
2,Died on me,"I bought this mp3 player and when i put an mp3 cd in, it took a very long time to play the song, and sometimes it wouldnt even play it at all. I was ver dissapointed, especially since it cost me $70.And then after about 8 or 9 months, it just wouldn't turn on. 2 stars for car kit and good ""normal cd"" player (for 8 months)"
4,"Very nice, but a couple small issues","This device is quite nice! Nice large LCD, VBR and folder support, full-disc shuffle, etc. The only problems I noticed are:- No true Line-out. (only one jack for headphone)- 2 second gap between tracks. This can make live recordings sound a little off.- Compared to my Kenwood DPC-885 (which is bulletproof), it seems a bit fragile.But overall, I give it a thumbs up! Get one today!"
4,MP3's Freeze up??????????,"Considering the massive amounts of music i download daily, this unit has become something i can't live without. This is actually the second one I've had after sending the last one back because while playing longer sets it always freezes up about 26-27 minutes into the set. I just got this one a couple of days ago and guess what????? The player is freezing up once again. I've tried different media and I'm always playing mp3's with a high bit rate. Anyone else having similar problems or have suggestions to this annoying problem."
3,No remote included and headphone socket is too loose,"The Philips EXP50317 eXpanium Personal CD Player has great sound, way superior to the crappy, cheap sound of RIO Volt series. That's what I expected from Philips, the inventor of the CD format. The navigation through MP3 CDs is quite good but doesn't reach the perfect interface of the RIO Volt series.Still I found it unsatisfactory for 2 main reasons that made me reutrn it:- The Amazon.com description reads: ""Includes AC adapter and 3-key remote control"" but no remote is included. Double checking in the manual revealed that the remote is an optional item.- The headphone socket is very loose so that the headphone plug slips out way too easily."
1,Hard to chew,"I am a bubble gum lover, particularly the doubble bubble variety. Although I received a case as ordered, the gum itself was rather old and impossible to chew. I can't even give it away. Customer service did nothing to resolve the situation so the case sits in the bottom of my filing cabinet."
5,Great Hat,"The hat fits great and the brim is a good width, perfect for shading the face and neck on sunny days. I recommend it highly."
1,Full of typos,"This review is about the product, namely the Kindle, not the author. There is one typo in IN ALMOST EVERY SENTENCE in the very first paragraph of this book alone. ""I swaggered o f."" What? ""I had a special a fiction"". What? Sorry Kindle, I am not reading any further."
4,Straight up Rock & Roll,"I was blown away when I heard these guys for the first time. They have such an exciting energy on the stage and in the studio. Their music will not only move you, it will also make you stop and think. Smart and non stop jams will make you relise why Goodnight Gracie will be flying to the top of the charts soon. Remember the name, and say ""Goodnight Gracie""."
3,cheap newsprint paper,There is one puzzle per page in this pocket sized book. It would have been overpriced at cover price $6.95.
4,Good entry level filter,"I was wondering why these filters were such a good value at $2.48 a pop. I looked inside and there isn't a metal core that holds back the filter media pleats. It's basically this hard plastic cylinder core in it's place. Sort of reminds me of the Wal Mart Super-tech Oil Filters, cause the design seems the same and the core middle is a hard plastic. The PF2 filter is the right tread and size for my 1999 Ford Explorer, but just like the Supertech filtes, it's a little shorter than the traditional Motorcraft FL-1A or Purolator PureOne PL30001, or Fram PH8A or TG8A. Over all, good value, but I would probably use it with lower end synthetic (Napa, Supertech, Accel, O'Reilly's) and not keep it in their for more than 4500 - 5000 miles."
3,A Nice Set Produced By Narada Michael Walden,"Shanice was promised a pretty successful, but brief, career after her 1987 debut when she was in her mid-teens. She has an impressive voice, including the ability to hit falsettos like a young Minnie Riperton, and shows on the impressive Riperton cover ""Lovin' You."" Fortunately, even though Shanice was just a teenager when she recorded this album, she doesn't overindulge in the falsetto like Mariah Carey did on her early releases. The only unfortunate thing is that she does overindulge in rapping, which is not her particular strength. ""I Love Your Smile"" and ""Silent Prayer,"" featuring the amazing voice of ex-New Edition member Johnny Gill stand out as the albums finest moments."
4,for me size ran true,"I read the reviews here with some trepidation, because of comments that the coat runs small -- but went ahead and ordered a large because it was on sale & I do need a warm, down coat; I am between a medium and a large. The coat arrived today, and it is basically true to size (if a tiny bit on the small side). For most clothes I am a medium, but for a coat I might take a large since I'd like some extra space for bulky underclothes or for sweaters. This coat went on easily over my regular clothes and zipped and snapped wtih no problem. I did not feel that I lacked mobility in my shoulders and arms as might be the case if the coat were too small. It's a decent coat; it seems really warm and definitely worth the price for a down coat. It's not high fashion."
3,Don't trust the sizing.,"I just received the coat, and it's great. But the sizing was at least two sizes smaller than usual. I ordered an xtra large and it's no more than a medium. Very disappointing because I have to return it."
1,This product damages Kyocera's reputation,"Our team is on the road a lot and our business depends on the mobile routers. We bought the KR1 when it first came out, we had lots of problem with it. It drops calls and drops WiFi signal, and we have to reboot it frequently. When we found another product 3G Phoebus from Top Global, we bought one and it works flawlessly ! We now have two routers, we are using Verizon AC580 with the KR1 and the new super fast Sprint EVDO Rev.A AC595 with the 3G Phoebus. When there is no Sprint coverage, then we turn on the KR1 with Verizon as a back up.I would NOT recommand KR1 for business use."
1,Faulty & Flawed,"I'm using this with a Verizon PC5740 card and the latest (1.008) firmware. The setup and use is easy, but the router periodically drops the connection and reboots. From what I've been able to ascertain by scouring the discussion forums, this might be due to the EVDO card interfering with the wi-fi connection. Someone suggested turning off the wi-fi in the KR-1 and connecting via Ethernet. Bingo. Works fine. Very stable. Unfortunately the KR-1 is not very useful to me without the wi-fi.I called Kyocera tech support twice before they decided the unit was defective. I've upgraded and downgraded the firmware to to avail. Changed all sorts of settings. This thing just won't work, at least not with my PC5740. I hear that the D-Link DIR-450 is a pretty good device. I think I'll return my KR-1 and get one."
2,When it works it works good,"We have a KR1 with a Kyocera 650 aircard with remote antenna. We use the wireless portion to talk to two laptops and one printer. When we bought it, it was the only wireless router. When it works, it works great, but it will not stay connected via the aircard for more than 20 minutes. Then you have to unplug it and restart.The dropping of the line is signal independent. Some areas the dropping is every 1-2 minutes others 15-20 minutes but it never stays connected. It also sometimes broadcasts its ssid and other times it doesn't.Based on input from others the problems we've encountered with the KR1 are inherent in the design. Software upgrades don't seem to work. We have just ordered a new D-Link DIR-450. We know D-Link collaborated with Kyocera on the KR1, and some folks speculate the DIR-450 will be just as bad. But we have talked to users that say the DIR-450 doesn't drop the line."
2,Used for an EVDO system.,"Living in a rural area without cable or broadband and a pretty slow dial-up we decided to go with EVDO and this was the router that was recommended to my ""engineer husband"". Our internet connection has been somewhat unreliable and I'm not sure whether it is the router's fault, the cellphone tower's/satellite's fault or a combination of the two. But I do know that when we can't connect we have to unplug the router and plug it back in and search for wireless network. While I wouldn't depend on my review to make a decision on purchasing this router, I would add it to the mix of reviews about this router before making decision."
1,So many problems!,I received the iPod quickly which was a plus. But it was horrible when it would only download 5 songs. I had friends who have the same iPod try to fix it and it never worked. I sent it back and requested a refund. It has been a month and a half and I have YET to get my $120 back.
4,ipod nano,i got my ipod nano almost 3 years ago. its worked perfect hee are some pros and cons about itprosits smallit can hold all the music ilike(250 songs )the navigation is very easy to useit charges pretty fastthe batter goes down quite slwolyconsit gets scratched easily(just buy a 1 dollar gel skin)it has had 2 minor bugs(just plug in ur pod to the computer go to >start>programs>ipod>ipod updater>refresh)the headphone jack doesnt really hold the headfones in wellover all this is a good buy but shop around for a bit u can get these new-refurbished for about 60 dollars @ some places
2,ipod nano black,well to start out i am usually not into anything other than cd players only because i have so many cds and i usually get hooked on a certain one for long periods of time...but when it comes to the ipod it is one of the greatest creations ever to hit music...i mean for sound quality....access to the music you upload...and uploading the music to your ipod it makes life ten times easier....but when it comes to the nano i would say if you have alot of music and want it all in one place upgrade to either the 2gb or i would highly recommend the 30 gig because its impossible to fill it up plus a bigger screen for videos is included....but thats just my opinion. anyone just looking for a quality product for a cheap price....pick this little guy up.....
2,works for a little while,"I bought this item about 6 months ago , it was clean , seriel number was missing form the back and the apple sign was also not there. Since it is refurb may be thats why , so it worked for a little while but then the battey wouldn't keep the charge , and it would turn off by its self during listning . The earphones that came with it were also fake cheap plastic made . I would recommend to get a new one that has a warrenty from the apple store . Sure you pay the price but it is guarenteed to work."
2,GET IRIVERE INSTEAD,Forget apple NANO get I-RIVER 2gb clix instead the ipod nano has no competition against the iriver .
2,Nice looking but thats it.,"No real documentation, have to reset it alot, stupid Do not disconnect message locking it up when you plug it into your computer. Have to plug it into your pc and leave it on to charge it."
3,It didn't work,I received it on time but the iPod never worked. I've send it to Apple and I'm waiting for their diagnosis or change.
5,ipod nano 1gb white,"I just got mine today and i find good! its bin working good!It holds up to 250 songs. It has extras such as 4 games, note pad, clock, calender, and schedual.The main menu can get cluddered but you can choose what it put on main menu so its up to you if it is.It also has a handy screen lock that you can turn on and off and you have a code so you can only unlock it if you have the code. I sugest using somthing you will rember!So far this has bin a good product! I love it!"
3,Fooled....,"I think i was fooled when i bought this ""brand new"" Ipod.When i wa looking for it, i never wanted it to be refurbished so everywhere i got into, i always selected that i wanted a brand new one.So i did it like this and what happened?I have a REFURBISHED-""brand new"" Ipod.So dissapointed..."
1,"bot all 6 Ipods had same Problems, also music Monopoly more","Full user opinionAfter loosing all my music because I wanted to put a cd on my iPod at work one day, I almost threw my iPod in the trash. I looked around and found the iPod killer.This baby does it all plus you get an FM radio and built in voice recorder!Thanks Creative Labs!,,,,,, Sam goodys dosent take Returns only store credit,,,,Creative Zen Vision:M (30GB, green)"
3,chained to the computer,"My son loves his new I-Pod! but there doesn't seem to be enough time before the battery runs out and has to be recharged. we don't have a portable computer, so taking it on trips is a waste of time, space and worrying about loosing it."
3,Apple Blues,The hardware is great(5 stars). I find the Apple iTunes cumbersome and _worse_ than MS (much worse than RealPlayer). Apple has committed the MS sin of trying to take over every aspect of your computer (without giving you easy to use direct control of files and properties).
2,earache,"Please be aware. People are complaining about their ears aching. Well, that's because u're damaging your ears. When u're rollerblading, running/jogging, or on a bike, u usually crank up the volume 10 times higher because the wind is blowing against u or away from you. People don't realize that u're damaging your ears especially with the earplugs. It's best to use ear phones that surround your outer ears instead of earplugs that aime the device directly in your inner ear."
4,Very good product,I love my iPod nano it gets 5 stars but the thing that brought it down is iTunes it's so complicated to use and it takes to long to load but i love the look and features of the nano tip: when you first buy your nano it's a good idea to buy a case because it takes up dust and scratches if you don't and it will make the sleek look of your nano go away also buy a service plan because for the battery because it is ireplaceable
4,"Great tool, gadget, toy!","I'm really enjoying my Nano. I bought it to replace an old and well-used mPio that I used for running. Although I've had to invest in several different attachment methods (skins, clips, armbands, necklace) to find the best system for me, I'm very pleased with the result. Prior to purchase I struggled with memory/price variables and am happy with the 1-gig memory I ultimately bought. It is more than adequate to hold 8-CDs of language instruction, plus several albums of my favorite music. Nano/iTunes hardware/software is easier to use, once I figured out the menu logic, than that of the mPio. My only complaint is that there seems to be no way to store all of my music in the iTunes Library and NOT have it update when I recharge. Since my Nano is only 1-gig, it can't hold my entire library of music at one time and iTunes wants to randomly choose what to install. I want control of what is installed without having to store it elsewhere on my computer."
1,Olympia hand Truck,"I did extensive research to find a lightweight unit that would carry significant weight. It was needed desparately and timely as I was beginning a move process. The unit arrived broken and the wheels fit so loosely on its axel that it created a wobbling effect, which made pulling extremely difficult. I did not have time to return it since the moving was in process when it arrived. I now have to take the Olympia unit and get it welded before it is usable. I was very disappointed. The company I work for has an Olympia, which made my original. I will inform my company of the difficulty I had. The Olympia being broken and with loose wheels make it a unit not to be purchased again and never to be recommended."
4,"Gee, these guys (and gals) ARE human!","Interesting story of one cadet's experiences during his final year at West Point. The author give you a good feeling of what it's like to be at West Point. He strips away the facade of tradition and allows you to see what it's really like. The interesting thing is that they're all a lot like the rest of us. This is a good coming-of-age story. Hopefully, there will be more from this author."
4,Maximum Weird,"This movie is self-described as ""an apocalyptic fetish horror musical chess sci-fi weird feature movie"" and that pretty much wraps everything up in a nutshell. If I were to describe this movie in a sentence, I'd say it is the closest thing to pronography without actually showing nudity, sorta like Bunuel's Belle Dejour. This is the 2nd time recently I've seen this movie, and even though it doesn't make any sense, I keep getting drawn back to it (maybe it's the musical segments). Any similarities to Alice Throught the Looking Glass are probably accidental, since the movie operates on dream-logic as well."
1,Not kinky enough,Themes of BDSM were taunted but not delivered. It was mostly just weird disjointed random dialog. It was voted the weirdest film of 2012 and was considered a failure. They filmed it in 6 days and obviously didn't bother editing the disjointed scenes.
1,My Review,"Unfortunately, it was a waste of $2.00, not much, sure, but what was the point of this movie? I didn't get it."
1,Very stupid,"This movie was the dumbest movie I ever tried to watch. I started watching it and ten minutes in , I turned it off"
1,Doesn't work out of the box.,I upgraded to the Basslink 2 after the Basslink 1 I had for over seven years finaly shorted out. This one didn't work out of the box and I'm still currently fighting it with some shred of hope it will magicaly work.
3,Watch out before you by the EXP50117,"I just bought this CD player, the problem that I find is that the resume botton, that helps to continue the music at the same moment where it was stop, only works for some minutes. After that, I have to find where I stay before and because the search is not fast, it takes a lot of time. In this case, I have always to remeber where I stop the CD. This will work when the mp3 file is not to large, but if it is a 30 minutes file, imaging you stop at the 15 minutes, it will take some time to get there.The rest of the CD player is ok."
4,"GOOD FOR PARENTS, TOO",What an informative and reader-friendly book! It is also a most valuable resource for parents. I wasted no time in sharing it with our married daughters and their families.
1,Poor design,The weight sled did not move up and down freely and the bolts needed to be loosened all the way to get the sled unstuck. So now it moves but it wobbles side to side. I selected this device since it was wider than the others out there in the same price range and has the same look as the ones in the gym. Since it is an convertible from leg press to hack squat the pad for the feet rocks back and forth which is very annoying along with the seat back moves around. It has poor design features and quality over all
4,Loved It!!!,One of Jim Carey's earlier movies. While not well know to anyone born in the 90's I loved this film and just had to buy it to enjoy it once more.
4,Cute old movie,"I haven't seen this movie in years and then it popped up in my recommendations and I just couldn't resist. It's not an oscar winner or anything, and some of the acting is way lame (why it's 4 stars instead of 5) but if you love funny old vampire movies, where the vampire isn't exactly scary, but not a fluffy bunny or a sparkly fairy, then you should definitely see this movie."
2,Twice Shy,"Some reviewers who've given this many stars have mentioned the beautiful Lauren Hutton. She's beautiful. But, you don't see much of her, this is after-all only a PG-13 release. There's no real sex in this.This film is, after-all one of a few vampire teen-comedies of the era (""I was a Teenage Vampire"", ""Teen Vamp"", ""Vamp"", ""Fright Night"" etc - of which the last two are infinitely more enjoyable).The sexy Lauren Hutton needs to feed off a virgin. She doesn't seem very adept at doing so!"
1,typical 80's sex comedy,"I watched this movie, having confused it with another one. This movie is not only vulgar, but without any entertainment value. I had forgotten how bad the 80's teen sex comedies could be. For a PG13, it contained a lot of nudity, references to pedophilia ( the comment about the Vienna Boy's Choir was irreverent and completely un-funny). I'd give it ""0"" stars, but that option is not available."
1,"Better than ""My Best Friend is a Vampire""","I liked this movie better than ""My Best Friend is a Vampire."" I think Lauren Hutton is sexy. Jim Carrey is funnier than that guy from ""My Best Friend is a Vampire."" If you watch only one of these two movies, make it ""Once Bitten"", not ""My Best Friend is a Vampire."""
3,Not my favorite Jim Carrey movie,"I don't think he makes a good Vampire. He was too young when this movie was made, and he wasn't very funny. but it was worth three stars for effort. Movie was in good condition and packaged good."
4,"Cute, teenage, Vampire flick.","Carey plays a high school guy trying to cope with his girlfriend's reluctance to go-all-the-way. To take an edge off his frustration, he goes with out with the guys and is instantly targeted by a female vampire's following. This is cute, light-hearted and happy-ending. As far as being a great vampire flick? Well, not if you like your flicks with a little venom in their bite. Enjoyable dance scenes and usual Carey style."
5,Once Bitten one of Storm's best films.,"It was a good vampire movie with great stars. Jim is my fav. Everybody think its going to be another horror about vampires, but no it's actually a very funny movie."
3,Once Bitten,This is a great video with Jim Carrey in his younger days! I think you'll live this movie if you like haunted movies So Beeeeeeewaaaaarrree!
3,One for the movie night.,"If you want a quality vampire movie, this is not the one for you. If you're expecting the antics that you're used to from Carrey, you will also be disappointed. However, this a great movie to include when you & your friends get together for a cheesy 80's movie night. Half corny comedy, half cute love story, it meets all exepctations of a campy 80s movie. So Jim Carrey didn't get to cut up. So what. It's still good. Watch it with no more expectations than what you'd have with something like ""Weird Science"" and you won't be disappointed. (And Carrey is just adorable! Especially with fangs!)"
2,Fairly Stupid Tales,"The graphic design of book is pretty OK, but it doesn't compensate for the bad (terrible) stories."
2,"Lame, Artsy Excuse for a Book...","The title does indeed say it all: Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales. The book stinks and the tales are stupid. I honestly feel like I have wasted my time for having read it. The only reason that I gave it two stars is that some of the art has creative redeeming value with the picture of the table of contents crashed, having some pages that are blank, and blanks spots where reluctant characters have run away. The art work and the text layout are worth studying. The text reads like a series of poorly executed campfire stories with the ugly duckng simply growing up to be an ugly duck and instead of having the sky not fall... the table of contents falls and crushes all of the characters in Chicken Licken...Crazy James"
1,Don't buy this book for young kids,"This book, while potentially humorous to teenagers, is basically a cynical spin on classic children's tales and nursery rhymes. However, they have been severely emasculated and stripped of all moral content.For example, in the ""Ugly Duckling"" story as presented in this book, the ugly duckling just grows up to be ugly.We bought this book at the local Goodwill without previewing it, and after reading out of it a couple times, I've decided to throw it away. I wouldn't consider giving it away or re-donating it because I wouldn't want anyone else to make the same mistake I did. Also, since children are particularly impressionable, I think the symbolism and allegories of moral content is critical in children's literature.At least the book is appropriately titled, ""...Fairly Stupid Tales."""
1,A bit strange !?!?,I ordered this book for my 6 year old but I think it is more for 8 year olds. It is strange and the illustrations are kind of spooky. Reading the book was a let down after reading all the great reviews!
2,careful,"be careful here. i ordered a book that was supposed to be in ""very good"" condition and it arrived with bits of food stuck on the pages and animal bite marks in the corners. thankfully i contacted them for a refund and the sent me another book that was in good condition at no additional charge. that was nice of them but it still made me weary."
1,Terrible book!!! Don't waste your money!!,The only reason I bought this book is because of the great reviews listed by Amazon.com. I think parents should re-look what they read to their children!! This book is horrible.....in my opinion it teaches children to make fun of each other. I DO NOT recommend this book.
1,would never want to read again,I cannot believe all the good reviews for this book. I got this book out of a recommendation from another book of children's reading. My 6 year old and now-12 year old were not impressed.The book makes stupid spin-offs from the classic fairy tales. I will stick with the originals.
5,Satisfied,I bought the book for my daughter and granddaughters... My daughter was thrilled to get it because it brought back memories of when she was younger. Now she enjoys reading it to her kids.
5,What fun!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book to my kids. And they thoroughly enjoyed listening to it. The humor is appealing to both parent and child. The illustration are really nice too.When my son was in 3rd grade, each parent had to come in for a 'reading day'. I chose this book and read it to the class. As anyone knows, keeping the attention of 30 eight year olds for more than a a couple minutes isn't easy. I have to say it was a hit. They all loved it!"
5,The best in fractured fairy tales!,"This is one of my favorite children's books, because it takes the old fairy tales we all know and love, then gives them a twist and a half! Check out the table of contents: The Princess and the Bowling Ball, The Really Ugly Duckling, Little Red Running Shorts, Cinderumpelstiltskin, The Tortoise and the Hair, and (my personal favorite) The Stinky Cheese Man! Each skewed story is told on just one page (okay, some extend to two or more) and they are, well, straaaaaaange. But kids dig 'em. Adults too. All you have to do is open your mind and let the weird, half-crazy side of you out."
5,A great romp on the wild-and-crazy side,"Several friends and I give each other children's books for special occasions. None of us have children yet, but we can still appreciate the simple stories and beautiful art in many of the wonderful books on the market today. I discovered this book while glancing through a friend's bookshelf one night after coffee. He asked if I'd read it, and when I said no, he told me to, ""Right now, right away, I mean it!"" I sat on the floor and followed his orders, and I'm glad I did. I hadn't laughed so hard at a book in ages. I went right out and got my own copy, and I'm giving it to another friend on her birthday. Whether you're an adult or not, whether you have kids or not, this book is just plain fun to have around. Pick up a copy, you won't be disappointed, except that you may wish it were longer."
5,Great book!,Our family just loves everything about this book--great illustrations and a new spin on a few old classics. Its a lot of fun to read out loud!
5,"not stinky, The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales","This book is really exciting. The stories are whacky, the illustrations are fabulous, and the layout is playful."
4,Great book but a little mature for my child,My child is only 2 1/2 and just becoming very interested in books. He loved hearing the stories but they are a bit long for his attention span. I have shelved it until next year.
5,I love this book,"When I read this to little kids, they say ""That's not the way it goes! Tell it right!"" But that's the whole point, and I love it! The non-linear structure, the way the stories overrun the pages, it's just sheer joy. I have shared this book with many friends, and I have given all my copies away. I have trouble keeping this one on my shelf."
1,remember the age range,"I was really disappointed with this book, bought based on the many great reviews. Having got it for my children 8, 6 and4. On reading it I feel that older kids would probably appreciate it as they would get the joke of it all. But mine definitely prefer the original stories. On checking some of the reviews I should have noticed that more adults preferred it."
1,degrading,"this book is very degrading, especially for children. There is nothing positive in that book, and while i am teaching my six y.o. daughter not to say stupid, she brings this book from school. I read the whole book, and i do not find anything funny in it, but stupid and degrading. This book is a shame!"
1,Too hip for kids?,"I think the ""hip"" humor of this book (and others by this author, Lane Smith, Moira Kalman) really appeal more to boomer parents than to kids. There are too many adult references and inside jokes. The adult friends who give them to us as gifts think they're really cool; my well-read and very bright kids (6 and 8) think they're goofy, but don't read them more than once or twice."
5,Childhood Favorite!,"I read this book over and over in 2nd and 3rd grade and had totally forgotten about it until seeing it recently at the library! It's an easy, fun read. Even my 5 year old nephew who doesn't appreciate my generations fairytales (i.e. Sponge Bob instead of Humpty Dumpty) LOVES this book too! Great illustrations too. Check it out! You'll definitely laugh!"
3,Funny!,"Simple read, but it's funny! If you're from the 80/90s and you want a fun book to read to your kids this is a fun choice."
4,perhaps more for parents than kids these days,"When I had my first daughter my husband was very excited to buy this book to read to her. I too recall it from my childhood but it had more of a sentimental value to him, and he's yet to actually read it to our daughter. He seems to get more enjoyment out of it than I hazard she ever will. He loves it to death so I suppose that's all that matters. I imagine when she gets a little older that perhaps he'll share it with her and explain to her why it's so hilarious and important to him. But you really need to be aware of the cynical humor this book contains. it's really not for everyone."
3,cute stories,Cute stories throughout and Stinky Cheese Man is great. The others are good as well and the kids like the twist on the fairy tales. Would not recommend for younger than 4 years however.
5,My god -- this is funny!,"A great book that I thought would sail over my 2 and 1/2 year old's head -- but she loves it! She has no idea about the original stories being parodied, but she loves the silliness and the artwork. I mean, she REALLY loves it -- I had to read her one of the stories for the tenth time before I could even leave for work this morning -- great stuff!"
1,the stinky cheese man is a stinky foray into insanity.,"the stinky cheese man is a book concerning a man who consists of stinky cheese. they should call it the stinky book. the book is very stinky, even stinkier than the stinky cheese man. stinks!"
1,Bad.,"This book does not have any literary, educational or artistic (sorry, Caldecott) value for children. Does not worth the paper it's printed on.The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales"
3,My 7 1/2 year old daughter gives this book 3 stars.,It's pretty good! Her favorite part is the ending
5,"Brings new meaning to the word ""Irreverent""","I love, love, love this book! Calling it an irreverent variation on fairy tales doesn't do the book justice.The narrator, Jack, mocks, spoofs, scoffs and heckles his way through these fractured fairy tales with no apologies. Everything is a goof from the crumbling title page, to the wacky fonts, the take-no-prisoners illustrations and finally the wildly eccentric stories.This is definately a read out loud book and not just to your kids! Read it when you need a serious dose of laugh out loud demented silliness.This is a visually comic masterpiece for everyone!"
5,Review of The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tale,"I loved this book! I read this book with my younger cousin who had gotten it for his birthday, we both laughed throughout the entire book! This book is great for children of all ages. Knowing the original stories makes these twists even better. The way the characters were mixed from story to story and how they were arguing with each other was great. It was so creative how they forgot the table of contents and then incorporated the narrator into the story. I have never read a story where the narrator becomes a character in the story. This is such a unique book! The crazy illustrations go right along with the stories. This is a great book for anyone to read, child or adult."
5,Sensational ride,"This record reminds me of Casablanca. It makes me want to cry, smile, and jump around. I guess Bogie never made me want to jump around, but its still my fave"
2,"Not bad for ""General Knowledg"", but lacking in content","I found this book to fair well in the category of ""General Knowledge"", but thought it needed a little more content. I now know all the different styles and basic wiring techniques but fail to find many of the pitfalls to training in some of the harsher styles.I would recommend this book to anyone who is a novice and lacks general knowledge, but would warn that there is much more to learn before attempting to train a bonsai tree."
5,A Moving Story,"Two stories interwoven into one poetic narrative. The story of the author's relationship with his father is enmeshed in the greater story of his people falling under Israeli occupation. There is much tension in this book: the tension of defending political prisoners subjected to torture in Israeli jails; the tension resulting from the author's choice not to follow in his father's footsteps and concentrate on human rights work rather than law practice; the tension from the destruction of land by the occupation and the erection of settlements. In the end, the two narratives unite as the the author's efforts to find his father's murderer are frustrated because of the occupation. A sad and moving human story, has much to tell for people everywhere."
5,Fabulous -- a must-read,"Like his earlier book ""Samed,"" this is a fabulous book. Raja Shehadeh writes about life under occupation with great nuance and perception. He gets far beyond the headlines we all see (suicide bombers, Israeli shootings etc.) and shows the toll that the past 50 years of conflict have taken on the daily life of Palestinian people -- the daily little perversions of one's worklife or family life that don't make headlines but are so grueling and demoralizing.He writes beautifully about his relationship with his father... about his own process of growing up.As someone who is Jewish and has spent time in Israel, I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the Israeli/Palestinian conflict on a human level. If we had leaders on both sides who were like Shehadeh, I believe we could easily end this tragic conflict."
3,A good read.,"I bought this book after watching the ""Bones"" television program. While the main character of the book series shares many traits with her tv counterpart, they are different in many ways. The book's main character, Temperence Brennan, is more flawed and has experienced life (she'd divorced and has a college-aged daughter). I will admit that the technical explanations of saw marks and such do go on a bit too long for me, I did enjoy this first book of the series. The crime detailed was quite gruesome, much like the tv series, so be ready for more than one disgusting description.A good read that will hold your interest. Hard to put down, at times."
4,Great Start,"I recently finsihed Deja Dead and thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes I agree that Kathy Reichs will be compared to Patricia Cornwell but she no doubt in turn will be compared to someone else! I enjoyed the plot, the chararters and the pace of the book. The forensic details were exactly that but it certainly helped me to understand things a lot better. Overall I think that Kathy Reichs has a lot of potential as a writer and I look forward to reading more of her stuff in the future. I do have one small criticism which I wonder have other readers noticed....after finishing 'Deja Dead' i started ""Death du Jour. Right now I'm about half way through it and I have noticed a few similarities with her first book. Maybe she should try and keep the plots as unique as possible."
4,GREAT DEBUT NOVEL!!,"Dr. Tempe Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who divides her professional time between her home state of North Carolina and Quebec City, Canada. When the body of a young woman is discovered dismembered and stashed in trash bags, it doesn't take Tempe long to discover a pattern that may indicate that a serial killer is on the loose. The murders are so brutal that Tempe finds herself becoming overly involved in the police investigation....leading to feelings of ill will from certain members of the police department, and also to her being personally targeted by the killer. When he strikes incredibly close to home in a devastating fashion, it soon becomes clear that Tempe's own life may most certainly be in danger.....Great book that I could not put down, that got off to a rather slow start. I persevered...and was rewarded. Get the book!!DYB"
3,Interesting but Patricia Cornwell has nothing to worry about,"As a great lover of the mystery/thriller genre,I thought the book interesting, but repetitive and its details very gruesome. Ms. Reichs never seems to be able to stop with a phrase itself, but continuesly adds comparisons, ie, his eyes were dark, like a sky on a gloomy night. I will read her next book, but I do wish she'd cut out the repetitiveness. I think her books would be more interesting."
4,"Nancy Drew, grown up and a forensic anthropologist!","I disagree with previous reviews. It is precisely the focus on forensic anthropology that makes this book unique and keeps Tempe Brennan from being a Scarpetta clone. Reichs brings in tools used by forensic anthropologists, such as distinguishing saw marks, aging and sexing skeletal remains, and the use of cadaver dogs. I give the review four stars rather than five because of the overreliance on some old formulae: the crusty cop who doesn't want to believe the female doc, the female doc who investigates on her own (shades of Nancy Drew!), and the wacky friend. A great book for forensic anthropology insiders--hope Reichs doesn't tone this down. It's what she does best."
4,Deja Dead,"In this, Kathy Reich's first novel, we meet Temperence Brennan, a forensic anthropologist. She analyzes bones and remains in the hopes of identifying them. When a murder case hits close to home, she becomes more involved than she should. Working with the police and on her own she tries to track this killer, putting herself at risk.A great first book, this murder mystery has believable characters and a plot that moves right along. There is a lot of scientific and technical information given in the book, but it is explained well and I never got the sense of being left behind.I eagerly look forward to starting the second book in the series, Death Du Jour."
1,sophomoric,"if the excerpt provided is indicative of the rest of the book ( and I can't imagine how it would otherwise be), save your time and money for something more worth while."
1,I'll have some whine with that cheese,"When this supposed Medical Examiner looks at the corpse of a young woman and think's ""dead hair day"" that's when I knew I was going to have a problem with the author. Apparently she think's this is funny...it's not. Then the entire book is about this Medical Examiner who does nothing but whine. Have fun trying to read this thing. It's really awful."
3,not bad for a first book,"This book is filled with all the gore of a forensic mystery but the dialogue is often forced, and unnaturally witty. I couldn't get into, or feel, for the character as I did with Kay Scarpetta. Unfortunately, Reichs has the misfortune of having to live up to Cornwell."
4,Pretty good!,"I only read this book because I do love the show ""Bones""...turns out the tv show is VERY LOOSELY based on the book series, judging from this one.If I didn't already have the Bones cast in mind, I probably would have enjoyed it more - however; it was a really good read, entertaining and well-written. I did feel that there was too much extraneous descriptive detail where it needn't be, and not enough where it should be.On the other hand, for my bone-and-gore reading, I prefer Patricia Cornwell. I may read more in the Tempe Brennan series, but it's not a priority. This was definitely worth the $5.99 I paid for it, but I think I'd rather check the library for the next one."
5,this is the start,"The 1st in a series of Dr Temperence Brennan. I found this very entertaining, I thought that the storyline & characters were very believable. The situations & explainations of the writer were unbelievalbe. aI also liked Detective Ryans character I hope they get together."
3,Amaaaazing!,Kathy Reichs's Deja Dead impressed me quite a lot! I could barely put it down and read it in a day!
1,So very disappointed in this book.,"I have read the first two books in this series, only because I bought them. Temperence is not a likeable character. When I put the book down I almost dread picking it back up again. Who says things like, ""That's about as kind as gravel in peanut butter"" or ""his hair was the color of a vanilla wafer,"" or ""his hair fell like linguine around his face,"" and too many others to state here. I can't stand it. I'm almost finished with the second book and there will be no more. I thought I had found another great series to keep me occupied for a long time, but that was just about as silly as a goose smoking the funny stuff."
1,Disappointing,"I find myself agreeing with what has already been stated in many of the one and two star reviews, and I am shocked to see that the book has an average 4 star rating. While Deja Dead is not unreadable, it is certainly a far cry from a 4 or 5 star book. I had many of the same issues with the book as other reviewers: excessive description, cliched characters, non-sensical actions by the protagonist, an underdeveloped villain, etc... It all just made for a very labored read because I had seen it all done so much better already by other authors. The concept was there, but the execution was very bad. Check out John Sandford or Michael Connelly for some really gripping mystery/thrillers."
3,First book,"I have read four of her books now and I read them out of order starting off with 2, 3, 4 and then 1.I was smitten wtih 2-4; however, I'm really glad that I didn't start off with the first book. The first third of the book wasn't written as well as the last third. Her odd turns of phrase and cliches had my eyes stuck under my lids with all the eyerolling I was doing.Thankfully, the rest of this book was better, but not as good a the next books.I still don't think Reichs is as a strong of a writer as P.C's Kay Scarpetta series, but I will come back for more."
4,Superb!,"I really didn't read the book but I listened to the book on tape. This is my first book on tape, and I was not disappointed. Sure enough, it might be different from reading it, but the story line still there. Just listening to Amy Irving, I can see and feel 'Dr. Tempe Brennan'. Now, I'm new fan of Dr. Kathy Reich. More power to you! Currently, I'm reading one of her book, and so far so good..."
5,Great read,"I started reading Kathy Reichs' book because I love the show Bones. It took awhile to adjust to the fact that the characters in the show are not identical, and sometimes completely different, than the characters in the book, although they may share the same name. After I got past the adjusting I found the book to be a great read."
3,Overwrought,"I had been meaning to start reading Kathy Reichs books for a while and when I got a Kindle I was really excited to read the basis for the ""Bones"" series which I really enjoy. Unfortunately, what I found was an extremely overwrought story that depicts its heroine and every character in the book as either quirky, bitter or super-man(woman). It became tiring and annoying to wade through some of the more descriptive passages of the story while waiting for something useful to happen or some progress in the story. I dont give up on books easily but I seriously considered stopping about halfway through and moving on to another book. I realize this was her first book so I will cut her some slack. Are her later books any better or should I not bother?"
3,"Very detailed, but not what I was expecting","I bought this book because I love the Bones television show and this was the first book in the series that inspired teh show. I was expecting it to be a little more like the television show, with great character interaction as well as the technical crime mysteries, but the book tends to go very far into the details of the science, to the point where it is over my head and I have to reread a page twelve times to figure out what was going on. Perhaps the rest of the books are different since this was the first, but I am not sure if I am willing to read the second book. Good story either way."
2,Sadly can't even get through it...,"I hate not finishing a book... even if it's not very good. But I just can't muddle through this one. I was looking forward to starting this series because I've just gotten into the Bones series and I love mystery/thriller/crime dramas and am always looking for new books to read...Between the French names and interjections (and I studied French) and the excessively wordy dull text, I can't bear to continue. Dr. Brennan is dull; the case is dull. The other characters are dull... not what I was hoping for..."
2,WAY too much technical information - this ain't a textbook!,"Patricia Cornwell covers the same territory as Kathy Reichs and her forensic anthropologist, Dr. Temperance (Tempe) Brennan. The difference is that Cornwell knows the limits of her audience.Yes, Cornwell also provides technical information for her pathologist, Dr. Kay Scarpetta - but she doesn't overwhelm the reader with fact after fact after fact, until you're ready to scream from all the overload. Sad to say, Reichs doesn't seem to know when to quit. I might have liked Tempe Brennan if she had just given me a chance to know her.Reichs needs to cut down on her technical data - by half at least - and deal more with personal and interpersonal information."
1,Deja Ew,"zzzzzzzzzzz! oh huh what? woah I just got finished reading Deja Dead and i fell asleep because it was so excrutiatingly BORING. Skip this book, watch a Ken Burns documentary which is about 100 more interesting and thats not saying much."
1,To Much Detail;,"Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist .The author is a anthropologist in real life and I feel she gave to much detail as to body parts & conditions ,& locations in the book , and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about ""Gabby "" including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of Gabbys place & How Gabby and Tempe were friends from GRad to man parts in life . Book was not for me I dropped it at the 3rd chapter ."
2,Deja Dead,"The shipping time was about 2 weeks longer than I expected and you can't get in touch with the shipper because the reply message says its within the shipping deadlines. ..In the past when the estimated time was 4-14 days it was never 15 or 16. The information is misleading when the explanation says ""on hand, will ship""...I never think that means that it is on hand and will sit there for two weeks before it is shipped. Not happy. This was the book selected for my book club and I ordered it over 3 weeks before the meeting. I received the book 3 days before the meeting and of course I did not have time to read it."
1,"Rambling, a very weak story line","After 200 pages I just gave up...a wandering journey through the life of Temperance Brennan, little regard for a plot or reader interest.The cast of characters is huge, allowing little focus on the significant players."
3,Overkill,"There is resolution in this story of a serial killer for which I was thankful.However, like much in this genre, it is way too long. How many murders of women do we need to get the point across - two or three would have been adequate; instead we are given six grisly butchered women with tabloid sensationalist descriptions. The author seems to get a vicarious thrill from these lengthy and repeated murders and the mood became more and more macabre.The story is plot-driven and the characters and their interactions are caricature-like. But there are a number of dead-end investigations so this makes the story somewhat realistic. The ""monkey incident"" was one of the better diversions."
5,Bones!,"Great book, I read it because I love the Bones series so much, and it was based on this author and her books. I can't wait to read the rest of her books!"
2,Not what I was hopping for...,"I am a long time fan of Bones the TV show and and enjoyed Kathy Reichs Young Adult Virals series, so I thought I would give this book a try. It is the book that started the Temperance Brenan Series which inspired the TV show Bones. I thought I would love this but... I didn't. It was painfully slow and the information that was supposed to be compelling fell flat. The character is NOTHING like the TV character and the forensics seemed a little stale. Maybe I was just to late to join this bandwagon and had I read this 15 years ago it would seem fresh. Today, it just doesn't hold up.The Inadvertent Thief (The Thief)"
2,Not at all like Bones,"So very disappointing. I purchased this book expecting it to be like my favorite series, Bones. It is not at all like the series. It was also hard to follow.There was a lot of unnecessary rambling.."
3,"Novel setting and character, but read like a lecture","As a Francophile, I really appreciated this book's Quebec setting and the snatches of French the author included. Tempe Brennan isn't really a Kay Scarpetta clone; she's an interesting character in her own right, with a really interesting job. And the plot was a compelling mystery. Unfortunately, author Kathy Reichs undid some of her good work with lectures about scientific and forensic procedure. This book read like a great thriller, interspersed with dry scientific lectures. Perhaps because I work in a scientific field, I found that Reichs tried too hard to explain what her character was doing. Hopefully, in her next work, she'll manage to better blend the scientific with the mystery. Still, this book is a million times better than the last couple of Kay Scarpetta outings."
4,Gory but Good,"I have not read Patricia Cornwell and I don't normally read this genre so I can only evaluate this book on its merits. Sure this book has some flaws but this is a first novel. Sure, there is gore, but only in the beginning chapters of the book, when the reader is allowed into the world of the forensic anthropologist. The description of maggots and a putrid corpse is awful, but we need to realize what we're asking others to do in the name of solving crimes. Let's not mince words here--the stench, the maggots, the ooze--all this is a real part of it and to not speak of it is wrong. This description, as awful as it is, makes the motivation behind Dr. Tempe Brannon's obsessive search for the killer more understandable. She has the unenviable job of cleaning up the mess and she wants to get at its source. I found this book to be a page-turner that carried me through from the beginning to the end."
2,"Layman's terminology, please.","I had a rough time with this book. The technical terminology slowed the book to a crawl and throwing in French, sometimes without interpretation, was frustrating. I found the writer's use of ""as if"" and ""like"" when giving visuals was overdone. It reminds me when someone uses ""you know"" so often you find yourself counting the number of times the phrase is used. I like to be able to visualize the characters when I read. This book left me with no visuals except the blood and gore. I can't believe it received such accolades from press reviews. The book moved along a little better after page 200 (could someone else have finished the book for her?), but the writer already lost me."
2,Bogged down,"I have to echo the sentiments of those who found the story too bogged down in technical details. I found myself skipping paragraphs at a time until I got to the part where Tempe Brennan interpreted the information in layman's terms. I thought the character development was shallow; I people prefer fleshed-out characters, I guess, not flat ones who seem to have hardly any pasts and little depth. Finally, what I found as irritating as the excessive technical jargon was all the French. A ""oui"" here and there would indicate that the character was of French descent (not that I cared); I didn't want the French lesson. Reichs might be proud of her bilingualism, but it was just more text for me to pass over."
2,I Gave Up on the Gore,"I hate to say this, but I gave up on DEJA DEAD, and found that one of my library staff members did, too. A feast of gratuitous gore, with women being carved up in the most gruesome ways possible added to extremely graphic autopsy scenes were enough to turn me off. I'm not squeamish, but I was neither intrigued nor titilated by all the chopped up body parts.I didn't find the writing particularly outstanding, and the descriptions of Quebec were merely tiresome. Maybe I missed something by not sticking with it, but I was disappointed in this debut outing."
3,"Been there, read that","Not that someone shouldn't try to do something that has already been done...just make sure you do it better. The text reads more like a medical book than a novel, although after the first 150 pages it seems to read better (or maybe I just got used to it). The only thing that kept me reading was the rave reviews it was getting. I'd like to see more of her work in the future as she does show promise, but let's hope she can develop her character more and add a bigger twist. You already knew who the guy was shortly into the book and the rest was trying to find him."
3,A little above mediocre,"I felt the similarity between Cornwall's work and Reich's was too close...Reich definitely loses by comparison. The gore that was present was not terribly different from Cornwall's, just a little distasteful with references to dead infants, etc."
5,Outstanding Page Turner,Kathy Reichs has created a supremely excellent book dealing with forensic medicine. Intriguing situations unfold until the last page. Congratulations to Reichs and her first novel.Warning: This book should be started early in a day to avoid bags under the eyes from staying up late in order to finish this masterful suspense novel.Cornwell has been surpassed!
3,Wow! A book about forensics/a serial killer. Great idea!,"Darn! If only I'd have thought of such an original idea for a book! I mean there can't be more than several hundred books on the exact same subject on the shelves right now. What a complete drought. And then that brilliant plot twist, so absolutely unpredictable, WHERE THE KILLER ACTUALLY BEGINS TO HOME IN ON THE DEAD BODY CHICK! Why do so many people compare this work to Cornwell's? Cornwell's dead body chick works in Richmond, VA, NOT CANADA!!! Jeeees! Some people"
1,"disturbing and annoying, bad combo","I became interested in this book because the tv series ""bones"" but this book fails to compare to it. The descriptions of body mutilation, and the horrible ""murder humor"" were extremely disturbing. I could not finish this book because I found it made me sick to my stomach too often, which is not typical for me. The characters are annoying and whiney and completely boring. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,Mediocre,"I only read 100 pages of this book and then had to stop. It is glutted with insignificant details like what the heroine eats...like any one cares. The police are seen as inept and unable to figure their way out of a paper bag, ony a whiny heroine could find the answers YAWN. I don't think i'll read anymore of this author there are much better books in this genre"
2,good,"I bought this book because of the TV series Bones which is based off of this series. I did not like the book however. The plot is too easy to guess what happens, and the animosity between the cops and Brenan is annoying...yes they do not get along, I do not have to be told this every page. Not a very fluid or engaging read."
1,"The ""heroine"" is a recovering alcoholic named Temperance...","I suppose one is supposed to find this irony engaging? From my point of view, it only serves to illustrate the lack of sublty and originality in Deja Dead. Tempe Brennan is not witty, humorous, or interesting but rather self-absorbed and whiny.The inclusion of a flawed heroine has become quite pervasive in suspense novels. And it's been done better by just about everyone."
4,Don't expect the TV Tempe,"I'm a fan of the tv show Bones, and have had this series recommended to me numerous times, so I was looking forward to this book! I already knew that the tv show was only loosely based on the books, so I wasn't surprised when I found out the book Tempe was older than the tv one, and that there is no Booth. Still, my knowledge of the show created a sort of disconnect for me, and I found myself reading this as though the book Tempe was an older version of the tv Tempe.All of that aside, I did enjoy this, though I didn't fall in love with it. It took me a while to warm up to Tempe, though I enjoyed the emotion she showed that the tv Tempe is often missing. There's a lot of detail in this book so it's not for the squeamish, but the plot is solid and keeps you guessing right up to the very end. It's definitely a series I will read more of."
4,"Finally, a book that kept me up all night!!!!","This is a book that anyone who likes suspense should read. It kept me up all night, I just wanted to see how it ended. Yes, there was a lot of French translation and the description of Montreal was a bit vivid, but to someone unfamiliar with both it wasn't a bother to read about. Actually, it made the story more real and gave the reader a chance to get ""into"" the story. Give it a try, if you like suspense and mystery then I guarantee you'll be pleased."
4,goodbye patricia cornwell!,"I picked this book up in Paris while on vacation. Not knowing anything about the book except that it is an ""international bestseller"", i decided to buy it. The book started off rather slow, but after the first 100 or so pages, I could not put the book down. The book is frightening and no details are spared. Excellent book for the Patricia Cornwell fans and those that enjoy murder/suspense stories."
4,Very good characters and sense of place-hard to put down,"I very much enjoyed this book. It was hard to put down since there were so many twists. The characters were very believable, and the author's sense of Montréal and Montréalers was excellent. I hope that she continues to write more mysteries like this one."
4,"Great detail, better character than Cornwell's","I was very impressed with Reichs' first novel. Great details, some of it a little hard to follow, but VERY interesting. What can she do for a encore? I felt the story was rich. You can really see the characters move and interact on the ""stage"". Sometimes, with Cornwell, I have a picture of only disembodied voices with really no ""set"" to put them in. Great suspense, you will not be able to put it down during the last hundred pages."
5,Entertaining and educational,"Enjoyed every bit. Learned some science. I got caught up in the story, found myself losing time. As the story heated up I started reading faster. On to book two."
4,Ready for the next novel,"A friend recommended Deja Dead to me as I was looking for something new that was part thriller, part mystery, part science. Deja Dead filled that order to a T. The main character is nicely complex: vulnerable yet strong-willed, smart and tenacious enough to get herself into tight spots."
5,what a great book.,"I have read other books by Dr. Reichs. What a great writter, and a well known Anthropologist. This a definate must read."
3,not a bad read,"story okay but too much medical lingo, could have done without all the gory details, could have done without half the information."
2,Deja Dead,Based on reviews I had read I really thought Kathy Reichs was going to be another Patricia Cornwell. Not even in the same ball club. Some parts of the book were way to technical and could have been shortened or even omitted. Took forever for me to read but I soldiered on only because I paid for this book.
1,Couldn't finish this book,"I purchased this for my Kindle so I know for sure when I'd had enough...I stopped at 75%.I have to say, I purchased this book because we enjoy the stories and characters on the TV show ""Bones"". The character of Temperance in the book doesn't seem to bear any resemblence to the one from the TV series.OK,that would have been fine except for my problem with the bad writing. I am weary from all the trite similies and uninteresting characters. I read another reader's opinion that Patricia Cornwall should ""move over"". To my mind,other forensic thriller authors shouldn't feel threatened by Kathy Reichs...not one little bit. It amazes me to see how many 4 & 5 star reviews there are.Just a humble opinion from an avid reader.Pat P from NJ"
3,"A good read, but too gruesome.","I have to admit I had trouble putting down this book. This was due in part because I wanted to find out who the killer was and not have such gory details lingering in my subconscious. I like a good mystery especially by a female author, but the descriptions of what had been done to the victims was a bit gratuitous. However, from a scientific point of view it was interesting to find out how autopsies are conducted."
2,too may undeveloped characters and too much gratuitous gore,"It's too bad readers will pick up this book and expect somethig special, from all the hype. It's not very well written as far as characters go (too many and not well developed), nor does the author make the most of the setting - she's doesn't get the flavour of Montreal nor does she really describe its diversity. The main character's discomfort with her police colleagues is ambiguous and the plot, ridden with cliches, wanders."
3,So So,"I have read two of her books previously. It gets somewhat redundant with the same theme. It gets tiresome reading about all the medical terms. I know she actually was in this field of forensic anthropology but ,in my opinion,it goes on and on. Only the names change but the plots are very predictable."
3,By the books thriller that entertains!!,"This book was exactly what I expected, which isn't a bad thing. Reichs offers up a formulaic but entertaining thriler focussing on the forensics involved in the case. It was pretty good stuff. My only problem is that we are told repeatedly how smart the main character is while she constantly does stupid things."
2,Not good....,"Too many details on forensics, which makes reading the book sometimes unbearable. It's nice to learn a few things about forensics, but I don't really need to know STEP BY STEP how she's operating it. Is it even relevant to the story? Showing-off, that's what it is. Besides, please trim down all the flowery descriptions about Montreal. They are not very interesting and certainly slow down the whole story. Where were the editors and how the heck did they approve this kind of writing in a thriller?"
2,Stick to the story,"This is a reasonable attempt at a first novel. The story was good and the author was at her best when giving us the gruesome details of the autopsies. Unfortunately her awkward attempt at trying to work every Montreal landsite and idiosyncrasy into the book wore me down real quick and almost destroyed the book completely. It was written like she'd spent a week there once and thought it would provide a nice backdrop to her book. Anyone wanting an excellent novel with the real Montreal in the background should check out Barney's Version. With a new editor I'd give Reichs' inevitable sequel a ""one more chance"" read."
1,Deja Dead Boring is more like it,"Deja Dead Boring should be the title. All the main character does the entire time is drive around the city, make phone calls, and tell the reader what she eats for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Why do I need to know what she eats all the time? The main character is supposed to be smart yet can't figure out that the guy stalking her friend is a psycho without the opinion of a former colleague. I don't see how people gave this book 5 stars. How did it even get an award? I bought this book thinking that it would have some semblance of the show which supposedly is based on the book. The Temperance in in this book in no way resembles the Temperance on the show. The book Temperance is humorless, without common sense, completely boring, and is the total opposite of her character on the show Bones. This is the 1st review I've done. The reason I made it is because I as astonished by all the acclaim that this novel has gotten."
3,Narrator - Audio Books,What is wrong with these authors they have the same character everytime but they use a different narrator. Just started watching the television show and like it very much so I wanted to read the books bought the audio books and listened to the first two but after the first two found that she has a different narrator everytime WILL NOT PURCHASE ANY MORE. PLEASE keep the same reader everytime if you are writing about the same character.
5,"Love the Brennan, love the science",I like the fact that I bought this book because I love the Tv show Bones and yet the character is different then in the show I find I don't care because its still a great read. I love the fact she keeps the science real and has a positive female lead.
3,Enough already.,"This book is a decent thriller, but is a little overdone with its constant details about Montreal. Every street the protagonist travels is named; every possible route is detailed with every possible fact. Things that aren't even really landmarks (like the Complexe Desjardins - even if it is the largest building in Montreal) are treated as such. She even quotes from a Roch Voisine song! Granted, it's just my opinion, but I feel that she has crossed the line between familiar and overdone."
3,Not great but shows promise......,"I am one of those that has become disenchanted with the Scarpetta/Cornwell books so I was looking forward to Reichs now carrying the torch for this sub-genre. Well it wasn't a clean exchange, she has room for improvement. I too found big chunks of the story to be very dry and I would like more character development. I will give Ms. Reichs another go as I feel she has the basis for interesting characters and story lines.Ree-views"
1,How can you get past the bad writing?,"I understand that many readers loved this novel and were caught up in the intrigue of the story; however, I couldn't get past the bad writing and character development (or non-development). For example, Claudel is supposed to be such an impossible person to work with, some kind of monster, yet if you re-read the first chapter, he virtually says or does nothing to confirm this. I was perplexed. Everything is over-described with visual references, as if Reichs is painting rather than writing. And yes, it's very much a copycat of Cornwell's successful character. Aside from that, I also understand that practice makes perfect. In the interest of all the rave reviews, I will now attempt Reich's second novel."
1,A tiresome bore,"I seem to be in the minority, but I tell you, I am still slogging through this novel. It has taken forever. The style is tedious and any good writing professor would tell her to stop the similes! If I read one more time, ""he walked like..."" ""she sounded like.."" I'll throw up. It's so distracting and so amateurish. I'll keep reading since there were so many raves, just to see if I can get into it, but I'm not hopeful. Sorry."
4,Deja Dead,"Though the book started out slow, it got much better with lots of effective, engaging twists and turns."
3,Could Be Better,"Since reading Kathy Reichs' first novel, ""Deja Dead"", I quit reading Kathy Reichs. Although I found the story interesting and main character likable enough, the writing style is plebian with enough bad metaphors and misplaced similes to trip up a professionally trained Shakespearian actor in the middle of a monolog. Since watching the new Fox TV series,Bones, I am tempted to give her another chance - please tell me the editor has done his/her job."
4,Great read,"I read this book while feeling let down with the new Cornwell mysteries that left out Scarpetta. I enjoyed this book and all of the mysteries inside it. Plus her other book, Death Dejour is a great one too. The only thing that has been bugging me was that Tempe always found dead bodies, and they always conected with the other unsolved murders. Unrealistic in most aspects, but still a lot of promise. Huh, listen to be I sound like a published critic!"
3,"Forensically tight, somewhat predictable.","Having read John Douglas's ""Mindhunter"", Deja Dead treads on similar territory and may be a little overly categorical in profiling serial murderers. As in many ""thrillers"", the protagonist often commits unreasonable acts or follows-through with behaviours that almost beg to be trounced upon by the youth-frustrated, stalking serial murderer. This book, while easy reading, follows a somewhat predictable line while throwing in the conflicted ""me against you"" investigative officials fighting over turf and reputation. It is somewhat apparent that the author (writing about a divorced female protagonist) finds some male fictional characters she writes about as unsophisticated and only adequately presentable. Generally speaking through, the book reads quickly and has enough plot to encourage continued reading."
5,Couldn't put it down,"A terrific read for mystery fans. It's a good thing I started reading this on the weekend, because I refused to stop until I was finished. Reichs spins a great plot with some interesting twists and turns, and keeps the suspense going. A little heavy on the detail with corpses and skeletons, but that just makes it feel like you're right there in the morgue with her while she's working. This isn't just slam, bam, let's hope I have a bestseller, either -- this lady can WRITE! I'm going to run out and buy her second book as soon as I get out of work today."
5,Kay Scarpetta meets Kinsey Malone,"A great crime novel! Finally, this is a book that stands up to the comparison with Patricia Cornwell's work. Although the dialogues are sometimes a bit flat, Tempe Brennan combines Kay Scarpetta's professional know-how and Kinsey Malone's (of the Sue Grafton series) bouncy sarcasm. The Quebec setting is also a refreshing change. Can't wait to read the next one!"
1,Patricia Cornwell very light,"I was very surprised to see the average review of this book was very high. I thought this was a tedious book and, even on her worst day, Patricia Cornwell and Kay Scarpetta have nothing to worry about."
3,Deja Dead (Temperance Brennan 1),"This book is ok, it does tend to drag on a bit,If u like Bones the TV series then I think you'll like this too."
3,A good weekend read,This is the first of Reichs books that I have read and I have enjoyed the book. I see other reviewers have compared her to Patricia Cornwall which I think is very accurate.Both the characters and the style of writing are very similar. I found Reichs descriptions of the autopsy work quite disturbing - no doubt about the accuracy there but not for the faint hearted. I got to like Brennan (inspite of her sometimes silly moves of solitary investigation)but her best friend left me wanting to scream - who in their right mind would put up with that type of abuse from a friend?This book is by no means an epic but I think Reichs is a good new author in the field of serial murders - well worth the time spent on a lazy weekend.
3,Slow start,"This is the first book I read by Kathy Reichs. It starts out slowly and it took a bit of effort to get into, . but that changes and quickly increases speed. All things considered, a good read."
5,You need this book!,"Any book on Ferrari written by Massini is a must have. There really is nothing else to say. Well researched over decades, worth reading for content and photos not found anywhere else."
1,Didn't fit 1998 Tacoma.,"The spark plug side didn't ""snap"" onto the plug. Also the injector side didn't latch into place. Returned these and bought the Denso wire set and that fit perfectly."
3,Be Carefull,"I bought this plug for my TOYOTA 4RUNNER amazon says that this plug fits into it and it actually does the probme is that the cables 3 and 4 are not long enough, so if you have a big car this cables would be useless, DONT BUY IT IF YOU HAVE A BIG CAR"
4,Thought Provoking,"Very good strategic title, with the graphics and gameplay to go right along with it. Very nice to come home after a long work day and sit down to a well thought out title. I'm currently playing this title, and enjoy it very much. The only thing I highly suggest to you Nvidia graphic card holders, is to make sure you are running the most updated graphic drivers available from www.nvidia.com. It has a very extensive paper manual that comes with the game. You should absolutely read it. Hehe. Have fun with it."
2,not what i expected...,"i expected this product to really seal in the polish and prevent chips, marks and other indentations but it didnt at all. even after i let it dry overnight, i touched the nail and it made an imprint. i find the essie polish refresher (shin-e) is much better!"
5,book,product received as was ofered. no problems with it and satisfaded with the order. also came on time as expected.
3,It's entertaining; a good beach read,"This book is entertaining enough for me to recommend reading it. Don't expect outstanding writing, but do take the time to read it (it doesn't take long). Molina is an endearing character, the movie subplots are interesting, and there are just enough changes in the story to keep you wondering. The footnotes do get annoying, but remember this was written in the 70s when they were necessary...plus, you really don't need to read them at all."
3,It's ok,This book is good. It's interesting to see how Manuel Puig integrates elements from films into this book. The movie is really really really bad. Do not watch it. The book is an ok read
3,Indiffrent,"Honestly I do not know how to rate this seller. I never got the book because he/she was out of town but he/she did issue a refund, although I would have rather had him/ her send it to me anyway."
4,Hysterical !!,"This CD is the funniest that I've encountered in a long time - if you like any kind of raunchy, classic 'Chef' humor, Chocolate Salty Balls will crack you up. The first time I heard it was driving home late at night on a Buffalo alternative rock station, and I loved it."

5,Sacrifice,"I have read quite a few John Farris books, and all are brilliant. However, this one and Son of the Endless Night are my two favorites. I must say, if the LA Times review(on the back flap) says their sanity was in tatters long before they finished the book, that's a book I want to read. A lot of the other big name horror writers have great things to say about him also (King, Straub, Bloch, Koontz). He's very different from anyone out there. I would recommend his older works, they're so outlandish, and SCARY and they read very contemporary even though they've been out there for a while."
2,Waste of Time...,"While I found the writing engaging and lucid, the plot was extremely predictable and frankly, laughable. I would not reccomend this book on any grounds, as it offers nothing new to the genre, has no deeper insight, and is more corny than suspenseful or horrific. I cannot understand the accolade this novel received in the genre..."
3,Very Sturdy,"Pros: Heavy duty construction. Large enough to avoid spills.Cons: drain spout is at a wierd angle so you need to make sure the container you are dumping into has a large opening. Don't care for rings at bottom, would prefer it to be smooth to make it easier to wipe down. (although these probably aid in rigidness)Was not able to find a drain pan with all of the features I wanted. This one was the winner based on size and heavy duty construction. A 4 star pan would address cons above and a 5 star pan would also include some sort of cover."
5,Awestruck,"For those of you out there who are trying to diss this album, stop trying. This is my second favorite boyz II men CD (II being my absolute favorite) but this CD has A LOT to offer. Beautiful instrumentals, incredible vocals, deep lyrics...how can you possibly criticize something of this level!!!! It is so rare for the production of an album be so good and the flow throughout the album be so outstanding. My favorite songs (although there are lots) are Lonely Heart, It's So Hard To Say Goodbye to Yesterday, and End Of The Road. Oh yeah, and to ""A Music Fan"" from California who reviewed it earlier, talking about ""the songs that her and her friends like""...B please ...Boyz II Men is not about popularity contests, it's deeper than that...get your OWN opinion!!!!!! Boyz II Men.....what R&B was meant to be."
2,Overrated,"I'll admit I'm not a big Boys ll Men fan. Yet I got their first cd many years ago after a friend told me I was missing out and I was upset I wasted my money. All the songs sounded alike to me so I put it in a box and never looked at it again. Recently I went through that box and found this cd and put it on. I was surprised that some of the songs didn't sound so bad. The strong songs are ''Uhh Ahh'', ''It's So Hard To Say Goodbye'', ''Under Pressure'' and of coarse ''Motown Philly'' which is the best song on the album.Those songs are the few high lights. When you take away those four songs the rest of the cd is still dry. It's too sappy and the songs all sound the same. It sounds like they used the same beat on every song. While many are shocked B2M are no longer hot, I'm not. I knew 20 years ago when they first started they weren't going to last. Their music was hot for the new jack swing era but when that trend faded so did they."
3,review,got this for a funeral. My mother was insistent on using a track from this album. I guess the album is ok. I was looking for something more uplifting!
3,Right door window motor,A1 Cardone power window motor arrived promptly.Polarity was switched on motor and instructionssaid to mimply reverse connector to motor butit only fits one way. .Up was down and down was up.I had to take apart theconnector and reverse wires.
3,Is this the right band?,"I bought this album under the assumption it was another band I have seen live and own a couple of their CDs. Obviously, this a Christian Rock band and the band I was referring to is not. I kind of wonder how this happen. I would be interested to know something about that. Leave me a message."
3,"Love it, but draining issues","I really love this machine and its versatility, but since the first week I've had it it has had problems draining. Specifically, it leaves two inches of water in the bottom of the washtub and it won't remove all the water unless I unplug the machine, let it sit for 5 minutes, then plug it back in.Anyone else have problems with draining water from the washtub?My drain hose is hooked onto my kitchen sink and it is about 1-2 inches above the height of the washer. So just as an experiment, I put the whole washer up on blocks so the drain hose was now well below the top of the washer. The problem persisted.I haven't had luck getting an authorized technician to come out and look at it. The vendor Danby gave me was a no-show for my scheduled appointment and I haven't had a chance to re-schedule and stay home from work to get this looked at.Any suggestions?"
1,Danby DTT420 Washing Machine,So far I'm not very happy with this product or the people who sold it to me. It arrived with one lid damaged. They haven't responded to me repeated requests for it to be fixed.The washer doesn't remove lint from anything!!! or Pet hair. After every load I have to spend time with a lint roller on every article of clothing to remove lint & pet hair. I'm going through lint rollers like crazy.If I wasn't handicapped I would pack this thing up & send it back immediately. Don't waste your money.
1,Crappy !!!,"This is so ridiculous I don't even know where to start. First of all I was totally fooled by the ""twin tubs"". First it says to fill to the desired wash size. That means hook it up to the sink, open it up and watch it fill until you see it on the measuring stick on the inside. Then you turn a ""timer"" for it to agitate, then you drain it then you watch it fill up again then you drain it again. Then you take the sopping wet clothes out a little at a time and put them in the tiny ""twin"" tub to spin the water out. This takes at least 2 or 3 times, depending on the load size. Since I was very dissatisfied, they said when I called to return it, that it would cost more to ship it back and pay a restocking charge, ""why didn't I just sell it in the paper?""BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE"
3,Tomb of Ligeia,"The Tomb Of Ligeia-Barely watchable snoozefest, A bore of a movie despite Having Vincent Price in it the movie is too slow and ""Theater-ish"".Maybe others can appreciate it more."
2,Mediocre Ligeia,"The Tomb of Ligeia is beautifully shot near a beach. The acting is good. The film boasts excellent costume design and set pieces. However, the plot is rather sluggish and uneventful. There is a lack of suspense and it seems to drag on forever. It finally ends with a very typical ending. There are no surprises here. This isn't as engaging, suspenseful, campy, or interesting as The Haunted Palace, The Raven, or Dr. Phibes."
4,Allan Poe's Best,I have to teach Edgar A. Poe and Vincent Price bring Poe to life. The movies are old but the adaptations of the master of terror are very well adapted.
5,"Corman, Price and Poe at their Best","Roger Corman delivers a masterpiece of filmmaking from Robert Towne's script based on the story ""Ligeia"" by Edgar Allan Poe. It seems like Corman saved his best Poe for last. Vincent Price gives a brilliant and genuinely cryptic performance in this movie (I love those crazy eyeglasses he wears). I think this is Vincent Price's best screen performance. It was almost like he wasn't acting at all. This is a lush and very attractive movie but beware what lies beneath it all. It has been very underrated by far. Did you see her move?"
1,No good to me,The DVD does not work on Australian equipment therefore total waste of money. No doubt there is no possibility of ever getting a refund or a replacement. Guess is just my bad management in ordering.
1,Cosine Wherry,"Bought the book from Flounder Bay Boat Lumber in Anacortes, Wa. Built the boat with lumber off the shelf at the home center. The instructions were clear and easily followed, but I had to call Flounder Bay Boat Lumber about a problem with one of the stern stations (they had a good and correct answer). The finished boat was beautiful and rowed like a dream. I always gathered a crowd at the launching ramp. I'll build another one soon."
2,Good for beatniks.,"I had a tape that I loved in the late 1980's. Beautiful, relaxing, interesting, called East Meets West. This was not it. Sounds like students at an art school banging on things. Some people might like this but not me."
1,HP 1240 Fax,"This machine is the poorest fax I have ever tried to use. Not well constructed but worst problem is the annoying buzz which the machine places on the phone line, which makes it unusable to share with a telephone. HP admits the problem, but has no fix or return policy on this; they state as long as the unit can send and receive a fax then the product is fine!"
2,How could anyone design something so flawed?!,"My work purchased this fax machine for limited use and thank goodness, because if I had to rely on this machine for everything I would be righteously mad!The Good: design is simple. I haven't had any problems with error messages except to tell me the ink is running low.The Bad: the fax is loud, and as someone who sits near it, it's annoying!The Frustrating: faxing one page is fine, which must be about all the makers expected the customer to do. But faxing two or more pages? A serious problem. The second page pushes the first page out of the holding tray and onto the floor. The reason for this is simple, HP neglected to include a little stopper on the end of the tray to prevent the paper from sliding off. In fact, I'm writing this review staring at five pieces of paper scattered on the floor, and one dangling ready to fall if another paper passes through. It's a mess! I wonder how anyone could have designed something so flawed?"
2,Not All That,"I bought this 6 disk box set for dirt cheap...~$11 and that included the S&H. That works out to about $2/CD. After doing a quick listen through I have to confess that $2/CD for this set is a bit high! Not impressed with it at all. :( Maybe it will grow on me and if so...I'll be back to retract this rating, but for now it gets a big thumbs down."
4,STUCK IN YOUR HEAD!,"What a great song, this cd single is worth to buy!, it's so sticky that will stay in your head for months!, great song! that talks about being in love, been ditch, and still loving, what a fact of life, don't you think!"
4,Tasteful fusion,"Stylistically similar to Metheny and diMeola, Wayne Johnson mixes elements of jazz, rock, and pop together tastefully with plenty of space for melodic improvisation. He's ably backed by Tribal Tech bassist Gary Willis and drummer Bill Berg, who also get in their share of licks. More aggressive than most smooth jazz, but still refined listening music. Guitar synth is used to good effect on ""Portrait of a Yak"". This is his best album as a leader, definitely worth having in your collection if you enjoy refined fusion music."
5,A Good Choice,"The Camp Chef meat press is a great choice for anyone who enjoys grilling or frying burgers or steaks. It works really good as a bacon press also. The large size allows for even cooking and faster completion. I would recommend this size for anyone with a family that enjoys burgers, bacon, or steaks. It also woks great with grilled veggies!"
1,Somebody already cooked with the press that I bought....,"I realize the description is a seasoned press... But, the box was absorbed with grease and the press had remnants of food on it. I know the difference, because I bought two... And the other was as expected. So this review is simply stating the disappointment in receiving an item that was suggested new and was not, and given the mention of food remnants, it' kinda gross."
3,Handle Is Loose,"This press is about what I exptected, except the handle is mounted very poorly. The tiny brass screws were loose and when I tried to tighten them I found they were basically stripped in their holes. I guess this piece of iron is a keeper but I will definitely need to rework the mounting of the handle. I'm planning on drilling all the way through the dowel and re-attaching it with a piece of threaded rod. Acorn nuts will make it look pretty good I think. Simply replacing the screws with larger ones might work as well.If the dimensions are really important to you then you will want to know that the description is a little off. The press delivered to me is 9 x 5 3/8 x I don't care how tall inches.There are pictures of two different castings in the description. The press I received has the peened texture on the top rather than smooth.If I had it to do again I think I would probably buy the press from Lodge instead, but I'm sure this one will work fine."
5,Good and heavy.,This is a really good product. Good handle and heavy metal. Not sure way the bottom is corrrugated. It might be better if the bottom was smooth. Maybe if you leave it on the griddle long enough to get hot and place it on a steak it would leave grill marks? Only if you use a griddle to cook steak and I would think most people use a grill and not a griddle to cook steak. Still a very good product.
3,Better for meat than bacon,"This is a decent press. It's heavy, it's large, but the bottom has grate like bars which makes it good for meat but not so good bacon. You want your bacon flat, but this one has these grates/bars on it which leaves your bacon unevenly cooked.Would I buy again: Probably.Worth the cost: Yes."
3,Good product,Make sure you look at the dimensions of your pans as compared to meat press. I didn't therefore it was too large. That is my fault not the products fault. I would recommend this product.
2,Careful with the Handles!,"Sorry to be the only bad review here, but it needs to be said: the handles on these presses are wood and highly flammable. I bought two for use making chicken and pressed sandwiches on the grill and finally got a chance to test them out today. I set them on the meat and went inside to get the tongs and when I came back out the handles had apparently disintegrated. I'm a pretty safe griller, but apparently a flare up must have caught the handles on fire. Lucky the flames didn't spread, but the press is pretty well useless without a handle. I am returning them in favor of one of the other presses for sale here with an all metal handle. Buyer beware!"
2,Three words: Made in China,"I guess even the Chinese are capable of casting iron. Let's face it, in the world of manufacturing that's child's play. My biggest complaint has to do with the wood handle. It looks like it was carved from a piece of balsa driftwood with a butter knife. Then, for the piece de resistance, they used some lame-ass bronze wood screws to secure it to the cast iron. I will not be showing this item to my friends at BBQ parties."
2,Bait and switch tactic,Shows one picture sends different item. They promote it with ribbed bottom so you can leave grill marks on top of what your grilling. Then they send you a flat bottom. Unethical business practice.
5,Happy with this purchase,"Well mad and heavy enough to do the job. The handle could be a little bigger, but does the job intended."
5,The Camp Chef,The cast iron bacon press was a Christmas gift to my granddaughter and she loves it. She now has crisp bacon like Grandpa makes! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great bacon/meat press.
1,Another bait and switch...,I am also a victim of bait and switch item. Received a Winco brand press that is not half as good as the Camp Chef press (I already own one of the Camp Chef and wanted to get a second one). Now I have to go through the hassle of doing a return for a low dollar item and will have to go to another merchant to buy a Camp Chef press since this is the only listing on Amazon.
3,"OK, but not long enough for bacon.","Everything ok, but I would like a bacon press long enough and wide enough to cover 4 entire strips of bacon"
5,Burning Down The Studio!,Dizzamn! This is one of the only CD's I felt deep down in my heart. Every artist on this CD put different kinds of styles and you can feel everyone of them. If they got rid of Ms. K they would have had one album that could have been Twista's best. Once Kamikaze hits don't expect Twista's old Albums to be nearly as great. I recommend getting this album with a passion.
1,what is this,"this ablum is doo doo the tracks on here are produced by toxic and some other dude, what happen to traxster i would not buy this cd because it is not twista style since traxster not doing any production it is not a good cd to buy."
5,Bass still hits hard,"Twista still has a tight flow and heavy bass in this CD. If you like Do or Die, Psycodramma, or just straight G music that bumps, get this CD."
3,Its not just Twista!,"Twista is definately a tight artist but this album doesnt have just Twista. Its sorda like his Mobstality album where he features others artist. All the albums are tight but I dont think twista has enough solo songs on this album. If hes gonna feature all these new artist, Then change the title to Twista and Whoeva so fans could know that its not just thista. I was expectin way more solo tracks.But its all good its still a good album."
2,Twista outshines the rest of his Legit family,"Similar to how Mo Thugs albums would be awful without appearences by Bone Thug members, Legit Ballin' alubms would be awful without Twista appearences. That being said, i will also say that Twista only appears on 3 or 4 tracks on this Legit Ballin Volume 1 album. Those 3 or 4 songs are great, ""Victory or Death"" being the biggest standout. But the rest of the members of the Legit Ballin family are only sub-par to awful. In conclusion, this album is kept afloat by Twista. The 3 or 4 tracks he is on may alone make this album worth having, but if you can download them somewhere, or buy the CD used, that would be a better bet."
4,"Great Ironman watch, was tired of plastic straps breaking...",The only issue I have is it is missing an interval timer link my other Ironman watches. Love the metal bracelet.
1,Bad watch band,"The watch itself is fine, but if you are on the move like I am avoid this watch. The band has a tiny pin to hold the band to the watch. Needless to say, it is not a strong one and does not work properly. After wearing it a month, I had to have the band replaced twice. Unless you are in the market for a clock avoid this at all cost!"
2,watch band,"Watch band was too large for wrist. I am a large man but could not adjust band to fit. Might be able to remove links,but would require to take to someone with special tools"
2,Sorry to be disappointed,"I have used Ironman watches for a while now and really like them. I started using the ones with the velcro bands for a while, but the velcro would wear out and the watch would want to come off while swimming. This kept necessitating the replacement of the watch bands. So I decided to try the ones with the plastic band. While this worked great, unfortunately, apparently I am allergic to whatever is used in this band, as my wrist turned red and swelled under the band. I decided to try this particular watch. It looks great and has all of the same great features. But unfortunatly, it sprung a leak the first time I tried to swim with it, wiping out a large portion of the LCD display. I guess I'll go back to the original velco banded ones."
1,Do Not Buy this Item if you are Outlook 2007,"I purchased this item for the ability to put appointments, etc. on the watch (Imports from Outlook) and not have to carry PDA, etc when riding my bike. Only after opening and working with the watch did I learn that it does not interface with the Outlook 2007 (out now for two years). That makes it basically a $9 Timex without functions. Contacted Timex and they said that they are working on a software update (after 2 years of 2007). If you are computer savvy and have upgraded your system do not buy this item. Now it is not returnable to Amazon because I opened the package and installed software - then finding out that 2007 does not work. Open package - not returnable. Your screwed."
5,Excellent older movie,I remember watching this movie in the 80's...loved it and the soundtrack....Gordon Lightfoot..my love for you is a cherished folk song adored by many.
1,Don't bother!,I don't know where they came up with 102 pages for the paperback version...there is exactly 49 pages of text and every other page is blank so YOU can write something on them. I guess the author felt like we wouldn't have any scrap paper around. More likely he wanted it to at least appear to have some volume to it. So we are down to 24 pages of writing...most of which I can summarize in 8 or 9 pages. This book should be about 50cents and you can read it on the subway heading home. Nothing new here. I can't imagine how he even got it published.
1,"In my opinion, equivalent to reading a tabloid.","Amazon should remove this from their list of blogs because of the rampant profanity, the unsubstantiated ""reporting"" and the blog's midleading title. Mostly gossip and second hand news. I reiterate that these are my opinions but I believe many people would agree."
1,Free Public Documents... for Sale on Amazon,"This free government document, paid for by U.S. taxpayers, is for sale on Amazon. Shame on you Amazon."
5,Complete. Enriches the water-colorist. Extraordinary.,I am a mexican water-colorist. The book has proven very useful and I recommend it to any one wishing to explore this territory. I would like to know if a translation into Spanish is available or is being considered in the future. The techniques are perfectly applicable and there is a dramatic progress as one follows the recommendations given in the book.
2,Good looking book.. but...,"Well, it was a nice book, nice paintings, some nice watercolor tricks...but it just didn't inspire me..something was missing.Maybe it was the ""cold how to do"" approach, that came up all through the book and the lack of originality. Im sorry to say i was disappointed."
1,I have seen better books!,"This book is not a good self teaching book, since there are little projects that you can follow and do by yourself. The landscapes are messy and unclean works of Mr. Szabo, that I didn't like at all!!I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody and I feel lucky that I borrowed the book from Public Library and didn't pay for it!"
5,The best rower,"Absolutely great! The only thing that beats this is the shell on the river, except when its really cold.Shipped as promised in good packing and the unit was mostly assembled. The rest was easy.If you can, get the S4 monitor with heart rate"
3,Could be a great product.,"The unit I received had four problems when I got it. First, one of the swaged in nuts for receiving the handle rests immediately cross-threaded and slipped in the metal in which it is installed. Therefore, that handle rest is only tenuously attached. Second, one of the foot pads does not lock into place. Third, the end of the stretch cord attaching to the drive belt pulled off during the first use. After 10-15 minutes of trying, I got it re-attached but I have no confidence that it will remain attached in the long run. Finally, the electronic monitor although it turns on and sets with no problem, does not seem to register any activity during the workout.I manged to fix most of these problems with some time and a few trips to the hardware store but I think it is fair to expect that a unit that costs this much will work without any fixing. I would not recommend buying this unless you can purchase it locally so that these kinds of problems can be quickly resolved."
4,Behind the scenes of TOS,"One of the first books written about the behind the scenes activities of TOS. Pictures, interviews, and anecdotes from the original production run."
3,Sturdy but I can't get it to hold a spinning rod.,"I purchased this item to use on my kayak. I mounted it outside the cockpit far enough forward as to not interfere with paddling. I screwed the base into the plastic shell of the kayak. It seats firmly. The first rod I tried was an old casting rod with the reel on top of the rod. This holder held the rod OK. Later I got out a good spinning rod and reel and tried to use this holder. The spinning reel hangs below the rod and I tried every way I could to get it to work - there's not enough room between the holder and the deck of the kayak for the reel. If anyone has discovered how to use this holder to effectively hold a spinning reel, I'd like to hear from them. Otherwise, it works with the reel on top, it's sturdy and the price is OK."
4,"Solid, but finishing isn't good. Not as good as scotty","Bought both Scotty and Cannon rod holders recently. The Cannon seems better designed on functions, but the finishing and quality isn't as nice as Scotty. Both are very solid tho."
5,Better than Scotty,"I ordered this one for the ""other"" hkayak and am thinking about exchanging mine for it. A much better holder than the Scotty. Kind of more bulky but seems to be more friendly in angles and adjustments."
5,Really excellent product,"Very sturdy product. You can tilt it as well as rotate 360 degrees. I also like the fact that you can remove the rod holder part and stow it away. No tools are required. Just pull up on the rod holder, and rotate it to align the locking pin, and it pulls right out. The only part that is permanent is the base. When using a boat cover, it is nice to remove the rod holders."
3,DS9 needs a STORYTELLER never mind some backward planet...,"O'Brien and Bashir play out their love-to-hate storyline that ran throughout most of seasons one and two, until they both became best friends. In this mediocre episode O'Brien is asked to tell stories, the end. The plot isn't the best but the banter between Bashir and O'Brien lifts the episode and makes a refreshing change from the ""every Starfleet officer adores every other Starfleet officer"" scenario that we often gen on the trouble-free high-morale Enterprise."
1,very short lifespan,"I purchased this monitor and it worked great for a while. Then it stopped working. Would only show a white screen with some streaks. Did some research and it seems that many people have had this problem. Some of the capacitors in the monitor are defective and have to be replaced. I opened mine and all of the 470 capacitors had blown, just like everyone else's. Pick a company that uses quality components in their products. (capacitors are cheap.)"
2,"Worked fine for awhile, then just died...","This monitor didn't even make it two years in our house. Weeks ago, the screen started flickering randomly. We called Proview customer service, where we were told it was the video card on our computer, not the monitor. That wasn't the case. It was the monitor! It died soon after hanging up the phone with tech support. I'd be very careful buying this monitor. Is nothing made to last anymore? The monitor wasn't cheap to begin with...it wasn't like we picked it up on clearance. It cost $249. Proview has lost a customer."
4,Very good Monitor at a great price,"I got this monitor from ""Staples"" for about two hundred dollars to replace an ancient and bulky 15"" CRT. After about A year, it is running as it did when I first hooked it up. No Visual distortions, no noises, no adjustment problems.What's good:The priceThe monitor is clean-looking and space efficient.A big improvement over the old CRTWhat's bad:Nothing to report here."
2,Blurry text and ghosting,"On both Mac and PC, the 17"" Proview LCD has sub-par display quality, with blurry text and ghosting (shadows). When it is in sleep mode, the Proview omits a very-high-pitched hum. The power cord is fixed, and the height is not adjustable. You (don't) get what you (don't) pay for. Despite the shortcomings, this monitor may be fine for occasional users on a budget who are simply replacing an old CRT type monitor."
3,"Works well, not the most elegant product","This holder works well. It is a bit of a pain to attach it. I have a 27.2 setpost and it barely fits. There appears to be a plastic insert that you could cut out and make it fit larger diameter tubes. I don't think after doing this that it would fit my post well though.The only place on my bike (Surly Crosscheck) I could find to mount it was on the seat tube. This works great except it fights for space with my saddle bag. If you do not have much seat post showing on your bike, this may be not fit well on the seat post.The red reflector fell off mine after the second ride. Thankfully it happened at home so I just used some silicone glue and put it back on."
5,Soft and Fluffy,I really didn't count on these being the best towels when I ordered them. I just liked the price and I really liked the color. When they got here I was very surprised at how thick they are. And even after washing they are still very soft. They don't shed much. I thought with as thick as they are that they would. I got 2 of the 6 piece towel sets and I am definitely going to get more for company (and so I don't have to do laundry as often ;) ).
4,Local History can be fun!,"Belmar Vol. 2 is a wonderful collection of photographs and commentary. Organized in a thoughtful manner, this book brings the reader through the twentieth century of a small Jersey Shore town. Being a small town, people with ties to this community will probably recognize some of the sights, people, and scenery. I have always had wonderful memories of my visits to Belmar, and this book attempts to bring those memories back to life!"
2,Buy Belmar Volume 1 instead,"If you want to buy just one of these books, get the first volume instead; it's great... lots of old pics and info about my beautiful Seashore community. Volume 2 is not very good. I bought it without seeing it, as most of you will do, and if I had realized what was in it (not much of anything and poorly edited), I would not have purchased."
1,order cancelled,"this is the second time i have placed an order for this item from shoplet, gotten a cofirmation and then later an email saying the order was cancelled but that i could go back on amazon to reorder. both times the price was much higher when i linked back to amazon than the original posted price when i ordered and which had been confirmed."
5,Classic Album From The Queen!!!!!,"This is one of my favorite 90's albums. I was suprised to see that there was no parental advisory. There is a Hell of a lot of cussing in ""Rough"" and ""UNITY"". This album is great. My fave song is ""Just Another Day"". That song is a classic. This is the best album from Latifah and a must own!"
2,average,U.N.I.T.Y was the cut.that song alone is 3 stars.but the disc is flat with the her Singing.Just ANother day was flat.when she puts out jams her stuff works best in uptempo flavor.some of the production is also lacking.
3,poor remake of a motown classic,I think latifah should stick to acting she triewd to comeback this would have sold in 1990 or 91 but the music scene changed and latifah like other artists goty into the habit of making a cd every 5 years or so.
3,Half and Half,"Good album, but during the time of its release, the Queen was branching out into TV and films. You can tell that it doesn't quite have the flavor of her earlier albums, but it's still good to listen to. The best cuts are ""U.N.I.T.Y"" and ""Weekend Love""."
5,<In a CLass of it's own>,"The best TeKn0 Mix of all time!!! Not owning this is a crime!!! Go fetch your credit card and purchase this now! You cannot comprehend it's contents, im not gonna bother to explain it, just buy it and strap your self in for the best of the best music!"
3,",","Not a bad book, the twists were predictable but interesting none the less. The problem I have with it is, now that the book is over I have a feeling that within a boring week with each other the couple would become bored and restless and split up.Good thing the book ended when it did."
5,Excellent book,"This is yet another wonderful story about two people who seem destined to be at odds for the rest of their lives but somehow manage to come together. My favorite part of the story is the ending, which made me smile for hours. Read this book...it'll cheer you up!"
4,WHAT A READ!,"Although some parts were tired some it was very sweet. I have to say this book had one of the male leads,and suprising I didn't really like the herione. It was very good thought. And it will really lifts your spirts."
4,Medeiros always writes beautifully,"Not only does she really ""get"" romance and love (unlike some authors who focus primarily on sexual attraction), but her writing is, quite simply, beautiful. I often catch myself stopping to pause and savor a particularly well-written phrase or sentence. Not many authors can do that.Lucy is, by turns, spunky and timid, depending upon the presence of her father, the admiral. But it is that contradiction that both enrages adn calls to Gerard Claremont. His rival is the mysterious Captain Doom...or is he? The twists and turns of betrayal and deceit keep the story moving and intriguing, and watching Lucy come out from under her father's thumb is good character development.Still, for me, it is not Medeiros' best work. I cannot put my finger on anything specific; I liked the book, but it just didn't resonant with me as some of her others have. Nevertheless, it is a very good book."
5,Something special!!!!,"I could not put this book down! I loved Gerard and Lucy togeather. This book was split into two parts and both were equally well written. It never lost momentum. Lucy and her lemon verbina, Gerard and his eye glasses. What fun!!!"
3,not bad,"There isn't much that hasn't been said in the other reviews. Cute, quick read. It drags on a little and it is VERY predictable, but still a good read. I like the pirate theme and the characters aren't bad.The reason I didn't rate this higher is because the female lead is constantly told she isn't wanted or is left behind by the hero, and she NEVER calls him on it. If she would have, just once, told him he can't leave her again without consequences, I would have felt more sympathy for her. I prefer female characters to have a little more backbone."
5,Wonderful Romantic book,"""Thief of Hearts"" by Teresa Medeiros stole my heart! The Prologue was so real and sad, you had to know more. The first chapter was so very exciting, I had to reread both before I continued the rest of the book. The author's words are so beautiful, I continued to reread sentences and paragraphs for the beauty of the words. The hero is perfect in so many ways and you will love his humor and cleverness throughout the book. You will love reading about every one of the characters; they all had special personalities and you felt you knew them. This is such a special romance that I feel anyone who has a romantic heart will love it. Captain Doom is definitely the star of the book."
1,Warner Brothers tries to cash in on Prince's songs.,"The Artist formerly known as Prince has left the Warner Brothers label and wishes to have the master recordings that WB had a stock in while he was with them. WB has said no and has disrespectfully decided to rerelease a single with nothing new on it. The Artist on the other hand, has decided to release a TRUE ""1999"" single by having seven new mixes of the classic song, including guest appearances by Rosie Gaines and Doug E. Fresh. That's the one to buy. Stay away from the 3 song ""1999"" single from Warner Bros. It's not worth it. Warner Brothers is only interested in ripping you off of your hard earned dollar with stale product. Support The Artist and buy his new version instead."
1,Most worthless item in Prince's catalogue,"but don't blame Prince; this release was entirely from WB, and shows it. While Prince's 1999: The New Master has something new that fans of the original and fans of Prince's more recent work will enjoy. While I don't care for the New Master single all that much, it still has some great material, and getting to hear 1999 amplified is a real treat. It shows above all else that Prince is not about to let business get in the way of art."
5,three solid Jams here,"""1999"" was the Jam easily.""How Come U Don't Call Me anymore"" is still stunning&Far better than that Granny Cheery Pop Version that ALicia Keys has out now.DMSR was a Bumping Jam.you can't get enough of it.Still thumping."
4,great Stevie Wonder album,"Ok, this is not INNERVISIONS or TALKING BOOK, but this album is beautiful in its own way. First, STEVIE is in fine form as a singer - just listen to the album and hear for yourself. Another costumer here on AMAZON asked ""Where's the melodies?"", and I answer, they're all here, just listen to FOR YOUR LOVE, the exquisite, beautiful ballad TABOO TO LOVE and I'M NEW, just to name a few tracks. Ans some songs are full of joy and spirituality, exactly what we expect form a great artist like STEVIE WONDER. About the ""hip-hop beats"": they're integrated to the songs and they're not intrusive - a lesson for some soul artists of the nineties.Don't waste you time with the old cliché that says ""STEVIE WONDER's music died in the 70's"" - the man's still delivering great, spiritual, deep music for us.Peace."
4,Talking Stevie Wonder's Blues,"Conversation Peace was Stevie Wonder's first album in four years and his first non soundtrack album in eight. While the wait was not necessarily worth it, you never complain when you get new material from Mr. Wonder. The album has a strong socially conscious slant with Mr. Wonder speaking out quite a bit, but the songs are among the most lush and pretty he's recorded. ""For Your Love"" is an absolutely gorgeous song and ""Sensuous Whisper"" is another great song. Other good songs include the title song, ""Tomorrow's Robin Will Sing"", ""Cold Chill"" and ""My Love Is With You"". Six years after it's release, we are still awaiting its follow up."
2,souled out,"Not a great example of Wonder's great ability. I prefer his more original work, although the tune ""conversation piece"" is Wonder-ful. The rest of the CD doesn't keep up though. Too much borrowed here. The quality of the sound on this CD is also 2 stars."
3,A Long Long Conversation,"Considering that Stevie Wonder's recent releases have been hit compilations for the last eight years,Conversation Peace may be considered as his final studio album.An attempt to find his place on mid 90's radio where hip hop and rap dominates.The attempt at incorporating hip hop elements into his music dilutes his music and makes him sound archaic(a problem with other musical geniuses of the past,Michael Jackson & Prince).Only a handful of songs slightly show his genius(Taboo To Love,Sensuous Whisper,Sorry),while others sound bland(For Your Love,Treat Myself).His message of peace and love tends to sound redundant and at nearly 75 minutes,the album meanders.Hopefully one day,Wonder,after eight years will find his muse and make music that withstand the test of time instead of keeping up with it."
2,Where's the melody,"A lot of drum loops and rhythm emphasis, unfortunately sparse on songwriting. Listening to this album just after recent visits with Fulfillingness' First Finale, Talking Book, Jungle Fever, and Music of my Mind depressed me. I view most contemporary artists as performers and vocal technicians who are alien to the craft of songwriting. Stevie, however, is the real deal--the consummate writer, multi-instrumentalist, producer. I hope he will return home to melody and soul on his next album. I'd trade my house just to hang out with this guy and learn some piano from him."
2,"Good sound, bad CD player","Got one of these to have in our new baby's room because of the remote feature. Being able to turn on/off, up/down without walking on the creaky floor is important with a new born :)Sound was very rich for both the CD player and the radio. Fairly easy to set time/date. Never used the alarm feature.The CD player itself, however, was horrible. Would not read several CDs, made loud clicking noises when it did work. I took it back to the store where I purchased it and exchanged it for another one. Same thing happened. Really disappointed.So - still looking for a clock radio/cd player solution.Pros: Sound quality, remote, ease of useCons: CD player would not read properly, also made loud clicking noises"
1,DO NOT BUY! FLAWED PRODUCT!,"I have never been more disappointed in an electronics product. The features were exactly what I was looking for, and the sound quality was excellent; BUT shortly after I got it the cd mechanism began clicking and skipping. Soon it simply wouldn't work anymore. I returned the product and RCA sent me a replacement. AMAZINGLY the replacement has the SAME PROBLEM!!Based on all the reviews I've seen, this is an epidemic with this model and RCA should definitely be ASHAMED! Thompson Consumer Electronics is the manufacturer. They also manufacture Lyra, Proscan, GE and other major products. I will avoid all RCA products based on this experience."
1,Great Sound but its Junk,"I've stopped bying RCA, the other bad reviews are all accurate, mine began to make a loud warbeling sound when the dryer downstairs buzzes. I Iknow it sounds like Green Acres, and it performs as well as anything Mr. Haney would sell. This could have been a great CD Radio Alarm, but it's junk. Don't by it. Every time I break down an by a RCA product, it proves to be a mistake. The digital voice recorder was another product that poor quality killed."
1,Utter garbage,"Worst baking pan I've ever owned. We received it as a gift (it had been on one of our wish lists) and found, before even using it, that there were several manufacturing flaws. Something had struck the pan in a pattern during the manufacturing process, creating a line of shallow gauges across the width of the pan's cooking surface. Also, the finish work on the rim edges, where it is folded over the rim and back under the lip, was extremely shoddy. Metal was rippled and uneven, leaving several sharp edges. There were at least 3 sharp spikes of scrap material sticking out from under the edges.No more Norpro for us."
1,METAL FLAKES BAKED INTO FOOD,"I've only used it for normal oven temperatures and only hand washed it. With each use it lost more and more of it's finish, but it's stainless steel so I didn't think it was coming off onto the food. However, today's batch of several pounds of roasted almonds that just came out of the oven are all COVERED IN METAL SPECKS! My money was doubly squandered."
2,Buckles with heat,"When I bought this I'm pretty sure reviewrs said it didn't buckle. However, it ALWAYS buckles when I put it in the oven, even at moderate temps like 350."
2,Not quite what I wanted and scratched too!,"The pan came with a small scratch in the center. I have used it once and it worked pretty well and cleaned up nicely. I was looking for something other than aluminum (causes Alzheimer's) and non-stick (causes cancer when heated). I wish I could have seen it first. I think it will be okay. Has a dip all around the edge and when I made oven fries, the oil gravitated to that low area. The potatoes cooked good anyway. Too much trouble to return it."
1,Not worth the price,I am very disappointed in this jelly roll pan; it can be flexed with very little effort and is definitely not the product I thought I was getting. Stainless steel is supposed to be strong and not bend this easily. It is definitely not worth the price. I was foolish not to read all the reviews before I purchased it. The worst thing is that I also purchased one as a gift and I am embarrassed to have given it to that person.
3,Nice finish but buckles in the oven,I've had this pan for about 2 years now and my conclusion is it is OK at best. I find myself looking for an alternate when I reach for a sheet pan.Things I like:-Nice shiny SS finish; that has kept it's finish with abuse-good lip on the pan to catch spills; I often bake calzones on it which often leak tomato juice-the lip contains spillage (see dislikes)-SS is dishwasher safe-nice size for smaller items like the reheat of a slice of pizza or twoDislikes:-When heated the pan distorts; This is the downfall of this pan is at about 350 degrees it will warp instantaneously and no longer be flat. If there is any liquid in the pan (drippings) they most likely be thrown from the pan all over the oven.-Just a bit small for cookies; but the distortion problem prevents you from using it for most cookies in fear of flying cookies!I'm not sure what is better out there....I just ordered a tri-ply sheet to see if it would be better. Stay tuned.Hope this helps
4,Actual Size: 16 1/8 X 11 1/8 Inches,"Disappointment.I have received the pan, it's very good quality so 4 stars, but the size in the title of the pan is not accurate.It is 16 1/8 X 11 1/8 inches, not 15 X 10 inches, so it will not fit into the electric countertop roaster oven I use.I'm very disappointed in the size. I've had my eye on this pan for months."
5,Just what I wanted,"Just in time for baking Christmas cookies, love this pan. It keeps its shape and bakes evenly and clean up is easy."
5,JCH,"I am so happy with these cookie sheets. I have been looking for them for awhile. They were such a great price I bought several. I have used them a few times since I bought them, and I am very pleased how they come out of the dishwasher looking the same way they did when I took them out of the package when they were new. The cookies I have cooked on them had a very uniform browning on the bottom."
1,Product is NOT 18/10 stainless steel!,"While the written description clearly states that this product is made from 18/10 stainless steel, IT IS NOT.When I received this product I was surprised that the packaging did not mention 18/10. So I e-mailed Norpro, the manufacturer. They told me that it is 18/0 stainless steel. Huge difference. People buy 18/10 because testing has shown that it leaches little or no nickel, etc. into food."
1,Garbage - don't buy,1. It scratches - just from cleaning it with scotch-brite sponge. This is the only stainless steel item I have that scratches.2. It warps - easily and frequently.3. It has a depression around the cooking surface (before the sidewalls) that is difficult to clean.Very sorry I bought it - will probably send it to the recycling service.
2,Shiny but warped,"As noted by other reviewers, these warp badly -- pretty much anything over 350 degrees, and even 350 is dicey. Not necessarily a problem if you are only using for cookies, but not useful for anything else!One (better) alternative is Chicago Metallic professional-grade large jelly roll pans -- available on Amazon, but also from Chef's Catalog (2 for $30) and at World Market (Cost Plus) stores. Costco also used to have a set of 3-4 professional-weight cookie/jelly roll pans even cheaper, so keep an eye out for those!"
1,thin,"Make in China is the main feature I try to avoid in kitchen items and was very disappointed to see this on this pan. Then the first time I cut bar cookies in this pan, the knife left deep cuts in the pan. Time to make a donation to Salvation Army."
3,Sent It Back,"This jelly roll pan arrived with a Norpro cookie sheet that was scratched and bent. I never used them, but sent them both back together. There was nothing on the label to indicate that the jelly roll pan I got is the same one that is described, not even the weight of the stainless steel. It felt light and flimsy, more like aluminum."
2,NICE TRAY BUT ARRIVED WITH SCRACHES,"This is a nice tray in weight and size BUT under the paper cover, it had scratches that won't come out. I was disappointed in the quality."
4,Great for ABC magnets,"These work really well for my toddler's ABC magnets! They're just the right size for him to carry around, and the shiny surface is fun for him. I can't attest to their use for actual baking, but I'm sure they'd make great DIY chalkboards, too!"
5,very nice,love it its great cant live with out it...its the best pan i could have ever asked for...thank you !
5,Stainless steel baking sheet,No problems at all with this baking sheet. It may warp a bit when in the heat but straightens out and looks like new almost immediately. I love it.
2,Buckles in the Oven,"I can't believe I didn't read the reviews. Oops! It's very pretty, but it buckled on the first use. I certainly do not recommend it."
5,Good product for a reasonable price,"This is a good sized sheet and great for the price. I love that we don't pay for shipping on Amazon.com. This sheet is not heavy like professional ones, but quite heavy for home baking needs. I baked puff pastries and it didn't stick. I baked breads in it and it worked great. It's easy to wash and maintain. Mine didn't warp when I baked it at 450 degrees. Most baking will be under that temperature and you shouldn't have any warping problems. I'd highly recommend this product to anybody who is looking to get rid of nonstick sheets."
2,Onother Cop/Killer Story,"BOOK ANALYSIS ""DEAD GAME""A book by James Neal Harvey, has a great beginning, the suspense is very intriguing but as the book develop it just fall into a regular cop/killer story, more like a TV episode of ""The Hunter"" in an extended version, the details are very well explained and you can get a good picture of the scenery. The ambiance is the same, good cop framed by an ex-con, the dialogues are good, although they are almost predictable. The personality of Razek although is interesting is very superficial despite the part about his medical history. I didn't like when the narrator used foul language, I can understand how a character like Razek can do it, even the cop, but the narrator has no grounds to use it. I thought the book was ok if you are into simplistic mystery and traditional history."
1,DOES NOT LIVE UP TO HARVEY'S OTHER WORK!,"By Reason of Insanity and Mental Case were fast paced and held your interest, but Dead Game was to drawn out and boring. I really liked the Ben Tolliver character and couldn't wait to read this book, however I was greatly disappointed. The story line was weak and the ending was totally unbelievable!"
2,Clip broke on first use,"The retaining clip is very weak and broke on first use. I inserted the cable in thePyle Home PHCT45 Network Cable Testerand it did not latch well. I removed the cable from the tester and gently bent the clip back and it broke off. For this price I expect better quality. It also is not ""snagless"". I did not do a data test with it, only a static test with the tester and it tested fine. I returned the item and ordered aC2G / Cables to Go 27167 Cat6 550MHz Snagless Patch Cable (100 Feet, White)instead."
5,P.F. Rocks,This is a great T-Shirt. The colors are vivid and it arrived before the scheduled delivery date. My friend loved it when I gave it to him for Christmas. Thank you to the vendor and delivery company
3,Expected something else,"I purchased this product for two reasons. First, that the product is organic. Second, that butternut squash is labor intensive to puree due to the thick skin. So, for those reasons, this is a great product. However, I felt the puree was really liquidy. I assumed it would be more like pumpkin puree. Having a soft solid texture. Also, it has a little twang after-taste. I felt the sweet potato puree had a similar after-taste. I was not familar with this type of puree product. I had always used Libby's canned pumpkin puree or homemade puree. Therefore, it is possible that my disappointment came from product comparison."
5,Always Organics,"I have been buying Farmer's Market organic butternut squash at my local supermarket for the past year. It wasn't always available when I shopped there so finding it on Amazon.com was a great find for me. This is probably the best butternut squash I have eaten, and it's well worth every penny......which by the way, comes out to far less 'pennies' at Amazon than at my local supermarket."
2,bitter,Very disappointed. This squash has a weird taste. It's kinda bitter and tinny. I didn't like it. It's nothing like fresh.
5,its a cool cd,"Ok, this cd was not quite what I expected. Its German, even though it has only 4 songs in German and the rest are in English. There are 20 songs, 5 of them are actually from SMoon, they include: theme song (in german), and others,like power of the moon, colors of love, dreamers, can't stop loving you, which are in English. The rest of songs are superhits of 1997. There are songs like Backstreet Boys ""Anywhere for you"", the Boyz, Caught in the Act...especially I liked first song, which was in German (by Blumchen I believe). Songs are all very different, but a lot of them are cool. Smoon songs are techno style (I loved them though!) I, personally, think its worth bying!"
5,A great bunch of songs,"I may only be 11 but i know what i like, i found this cd to be one of the best around.I've watched SM since i was 4 years old,then they stopped showing it and moved it to a different channle but when i heard it was back i threw myself on the couch and got right back in with all the other SM fans. This CD is the best and i hope you think so too.SM all the way!"
3,Would you see all German Sailor Moon CD's?,"Hello. I'm a German Sailor Moon Fan, sorry my english is not so good! When you want to see all Sailor Monn CD's from Germany, E-mail me! I have an Original Song CD, too. Of this are the best Japanese Songs from the motion pictures and the Serie of Japanese. Sailor Moon - Das Mädchen mit den Zauberkräften (S. M. - The girl with the Magic Power). Bye!"
4,GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!..BUT,"I LISTENED TO A FRIEND'S BOXED SET AND I THINK IT WAS AWSOME EXCEPT, WHERE WAS ""MEMORIES"" AND ""FIREFLY""? THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION, RIGHT? HOW CAN THIS BE IF THESE TWO CLASSICS AREN'T ON HERE?? THAT'S WHY I'M ONLY GIVING IT 4 STARS. IN ANY SENSE, IT'S STILL A GREAT SELECTION, ESPECIALLY THE BOOKLET. I'M ON MY WAY TO GET MINE NOW.I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED, IT'S JUST THAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS FOR A WHILE AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE EVERYTHING THEY DID (INCLUDING THEIR FAMOUS RENDITIONS OF SILENT NIGHT AND RUDOLPH). I WISH THAT WHO EVER DID THIS COMPLIATION WOULD'VE SUBSTITUTED A COUPLE OF THE UNRELEASED SONGS FOR THESE FEW GEMS. OH WELL, I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO PURCHASE ""FOR LOVERS ONLY"" AND ADD ""FIREFLY"" TO MY OWN COMPILATION. DESPITE THAT, IT STILL IS GREAT LISTENING!!"
3,I was very disappointed!,"I bought this box set two years ago and I must say that I couldn't have been more disappointed. Not with the song selection but with the quality of the recordings. One song in particualar Memories is one of my all-time favorite songs and the sound quality is so poor that it sounds like I'm listening to a radio station with low signal strength.I love the Temptations, but for the money, I'd advise anyone to wait until someone decides to do their music justice and remaster it."
5,The Royal Box of R&B,"This is a rare boxed set that has both everything and not enough.Get this box set, and you'll have everything thats essential of the Temps.For those who complain about the mono mixes,should remember these are the way they they were first heard when they were first released.And to replicate the experience of the first time listeners heard these songs,the way they were originally mixed, is presented on the boxed set.The other surprise is the hidden accapella version of My Girl,bringing out David Ruffin's magnificent voice with even more clarity(disc 2-track 26).One of the rarest boxed sets that even at five CD's,you still can't get tired of listening to it."
5,Great Package,"The product is exquisitely packaged and arrived on time. Although some of my favorite songs e.g. Hurry Tomorrow and Ma were omitted, the collection was still treasurable."
1,Major Disappointment - Don't Waste Your Money,"I can't believe that an anthology album of one of the greatest groups in history, would be treated in a manner as to take away from the quality of their recorded performances. The vast majority of the songs in this compilation are in mono (monaural). That is ridiculous. Why would Motown Records do such a thing? The stereo recordings exist, as well as most of the master multichannel recording tapes. Even the beautiful ""Just my imagination"" is not stereo. The ""Psychedelic Shack"" intro begins in stereo, then reverts to mono. That could only have been done intentionally. If it wasn't for the booklet, and the inclusion of some of the earliest formative works, I would give it zero stars. As it is, and for those reasons only, I'll give it one star.Don't waste your money. You're better off spending the money to get the re-releases of their original albums, and other compilations."
2,Cheaply made,Received two of these remotes with my Genie Excelerator garage door opener purchased from Home Depot. The remotes range is very short and the plastic clip holder does not hold the remote any longer - falls out. Very cheaply made and is disappointing since it would have been so easy to design this right to begin with. Makes you wonder if Genie put a similar lack of integrity into the opener itself.
1,Not what I ordered,"I specifically ordered the 3BL model, because that's what I've been using for 15 years with no problems. But they sent me the G2T model, which takes a different battery and barely works at all. You have to press the button ten times, whack the thing a few times and then press it ten times more and hopefully the door will open. What a ripoff."
1,False Advertising,"The remote is easy to program and works with our receiver, but like other reviewers have said, it has a short range. I just got them today so I am not sure about the battery life. It does not come with the 12V battery that is stated in the description, so this is why I am giving it a 1-star rating. The battery it does have isn't very strong and is very difficult to remove. Good chance of breaking the remote trying to get it out. It was probably designed this way in hopes that consumers do break them and have to purchase new ones. If you are ok the the weaknesses this small disk battery pose then this remote will suit your needs. I don't think it is anywhere near the quality of remote that came with the garage door opener."
2,battery lasted only a 2 weeks,"We bought this brand new. It comes with a battery. After my husband programmed it, it worked but just for around 2 weeks. We used it for maybe 3 times then the battery die. I hope it is the battery. We have to buy new battery which is quite expensive. We have 3 of these remote controls. Usually we only need to change battery once a year, the most. Quite disappointed after buying it, program it and it didn't work.Genie GIT-3BL 3-Button Remote Control with Intellicode"
1,Whirlpool AD50US,"Worked great for a year and a half, then froze up, took it apartand cleaned it but still the same thing. Now wondering if itsworth it to throw good money on bad money, so far very disappointing.AW"
1,Died after nine months,"I bought the 40 pint version of this Whirlpool dehumidifier last September and it did indeed dehumidify when the outside temp was 50 degrees. It rested during the winter (I live in northern Virginia) and I tried to get it going this past May and no luck. I took it to a very reputable repair shop and they declared it dead. $200 down a rathole.We also bought a Whirlpool dishwasher a couple years ago. As far as brand names go, it might as well be an Ajax brand model. It has never gotten dishes half as clean as the old avocado green one we had in the 1970's. Now we're looking for a fridge, and it's not going to be a Whirlpool."
1,Too poorly made to waste your time with...,We went with this unit because of the brand name. Big mistake. No sound dampening material is used whatsoever. The metal on metal construction leaves creates one big buzzing rattle box.It was so loud it scared my kids. Returned it for a refund. A shameful lack of consideration went into the design - the number of buzzes and rattles was astounding.
1,Compressor blew in 1.5 years,"Bought this for use in our damp basement so the loud noise was not an issue and it did pretty ok keeping the basement relatively dry in the summer/rainy months. But you cannot select the actual humidity % control so you are not really sure what your humiduty level is while this is working unless you buy another humidity measurement tool and use it there. The main reason I wouldn't buy another whirlpool is because the compressor blew in 1.5 years and it blew with a bang and lots of sparks flying. Lucky I was there when it happened and pulled the plug quickly otherwise who knows, a fire could've burned my house down."
2,The loudest appliance in my home...,"Like the previous reviewer, I went with Whirlpool because of brand loyalty, not a good decision. This product is unbelievably loud and clunky-sounding(rattle-metal-on-metal). When I open my basement door it sounds like there is a jet aircraft in my basement. The unit does work as advertised, I have no issue with its performance, just can't get past the noise."
4,Warm socks for Wide Feet,"Simcan Comfort Wool Mid-Calf socks are my FAVORITE socks in the winter. The blend of merino wool and cotton combine to make a sock that is both soft and warm. I have wide feet (I wear a women's 9 W or WW) and find that women's socks are too constricting for both my feet and lower calves. The Simcan Comfort Wool sock stretches easily to fit my feet and calves, but has enough resilience due to the rib knit cuff and the lycra in the knit that they do not sag.The downside to the softness and stretch is that I find that these socks are not very long-wearing. They can wear through rather quickly from friction. The fashioning of the heel is also a point of weakness - some socks develop holes there very quickly.As my feet are almost always cold in the winter, I am willing to buy socks a bit more frequently to have warm, comfortable feet and legs"
2,Buy the other book,"Maybe it is just me, but last time I checked the anatomy of musculature between women and men is quite similar, and when it comes to strength training anatomy I do not see a reason that the different sexes need a completely different book. The book is decently illustrated with one glaring exception: WOMEN'S PECORTALUS MUCSLES DONOT LOOK LIKE BREASTS!"
1,Marketing lies,"This book is actually a partial reprint of Delavier's complete book, ""Strength Training Anatomy,"" which includes both upper and lower body workout illustrations. But in that book, almost all of the upper body illustrations are of men working out -- so I'm guessing they just took the second half of that book and repackaged it ""for women"" (though I haven't actually read this book).The complete book is a good collection of exercises. I would definitely recommend it, even with its sometimes unnecessarily sexually graphic illustrations."
2,What happened to the Upper Body chapters??,"After my friends (male) and I stopped giggling over the overly sexual illustrations, I realized that exercises for half of the body were missing! Huh?! I don't know if I should be merely insulted or just pissed off because I got half a book."
2,Incomplete in itself...,"A good book for what it offers, but incomplete because it only covers anatomy that differs from the male. This is a follow up book to Strength Training Anatomy, which only deals with the male anatomy. To get the complete picture for women requires both books. The Women's version leaves out chest and arms altogether. So, like the title says, it is incomplete in itself. Look elsewhere if you only want to buy one book."
3,Why Just for Women?,I compared the two books by Delavier and chose the basic Strength Training one because it was more comprehensive. As a woman I don't like to feel limited in my choice of content or to have an edited version of anatomy for strength training.
5,Great teaching tool,"I love this book! I am a fitness specialist at a hospital, and it is a great reference! Would highly recommend."
2,Wait....what happened to the rest........?,"Ah...I see. I suppose women aren't generally interested in working out the upper-half of their body. Must be that myth out there that we will develop 'bulky' muscles from working out our arms, shoulders and pecs. Too bad that this book will only perpetuate this myth."
2,Where's the Rest?,"Yes, sorry, yet another woman dissatisfied with only abs back legs and buttocks illustrations. I am a Personal Trainer and was thrilled to see a version of ""Strength Training Anatomy"" for the female body...and then immediately disappointed that Mr Delavier didn't finish the book. I just can't imagine what he was thinking of! Oh well back to the male version (brilliant) and drawings unrepresentative of the muscle mass of half my clients! We wait with baited breath for your sequel Mr Delavier - Chest, Shoulders & Arms!"
3,Not worth the extra expense,"I've had this stove for about a year. The electronic ignition is unreliable, therefore useless, so I use matches. Also you can't see the flame unless it is turned up all the way, which makes it hard to gauge the level (and you have to hold your hand over it to see if it's on or just hissing gas instead). Also, the lid latch doesn't work so it flops open when you pick it up unless you remember to hold your finger on the lid. This stove LOOKS better than it really is, but maybe that's what you're paying for."
5,Viva La Pitt!,"They just don't make'em like this anymore! Forget the holes in the storylines that make bits and pieces of these films somewhat senseless. Just relish the overall beauty of the productions, the lush musical scores, and the wonderful and attractive group of actors,especially the luscious Ms. Pitt, that combine to make The Vampire Lovers and Countess Dracula two of the best of the Hammer flicks and horror films in general."
2,Countess Dracula / The Vampire Lovers,"If you are buying it for The Vampire Lovers, then avoid it like the plague. It is ""not"" true wide screen.They just put black over the top and bottom of the screen. You will miss many ""nice"" shots. The 2 seconds of Ingrid Pitt getting out of the tub and 2 severed heads do not make up for everything else you miss. Countess Dracula however has the proper ratio. mes."
2,Vampire Lovers?,"This review is only for ""the Vampire Lovers."" I've seen ""Countess Dracula, but it's been 25 or more years ago, so I can't do a honest review for that film, though I remember liking it.2 1/2 Stars = Fair""The Vampire Lovers"" is typical post 1970 Hammer Studio's vampire film. A lot of nudity from amply endowed, pretty girls, strongly implied lesbians scenes, but rather anemic. Stick with the late 50's to the late 60's vampire films from Hammer, especially those directed by Terrance Fisher. Their, shall I say, are more full blooded."
3,Countess Dracula (1970) [3.5 stars],"the beautiful Ingrid Pitt, queen of horror, stars in this gothic horror Hammer Production. Story seems to be based during the Middle Ages, since we have castles and horses and servants and poverty thrown in the mix.An aging widow queen discovers the secret of youth when she discovers that applying virgin's blood to her body renders her to a beautiful 20 something age. Like a classic vampire story, she needs constant blood to remain young, or else she reverts back to her old age.Several women in the village go missing, and eventually the widow queen is finally captured and brought to justice.what I liked about the film: Ingrid Pitt. Also the sets were very elaborate and the look and ""feel"" of the film was very believable. Interior shots were well lit and looked liked the inside of a genuine castle.* recommended viewing *"
4,A vampire to love,"Ingrid Pitt set the standard for women playing vampires. The only performance to come close was Sadie Frost in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" Though lacking the blood and (dare I say it?) bite of other Hammer classics, watching it today reminds me of what I loved watching Chiller Theater on Friday nights on late night local TV. Except now, of course, you get the previously deleted scenes which are hotter and steamier than the bath she takes."
5,"Fangs, Females and Fun","Female vampires, who prefer to nibble on female victims...oh yeah. And some very lovey, sexy ladies of the ""Hammer"" studios at the time.Highly recommend."
5,THANK YOU HAMMER FOR GIVING US INGRID PITT!!!,"1970 was a very good year for Hammer Studios and the very sexy Ingrid Pitt. Here on one two-sided disc, are two of her finest performances.COUNTESS DRACULA is a bit misleadingly titled, since Pitt's character is actually based on Elizabeth Bathory, not Dracula. No matter, there is still no shortage of blood being spilled in all directions, as the youth obsessed Countess kills virgins in a futile effort to maintain her beauty.THE VAMPIRE LOVERS (the first in Hammer's Kanrnstein Trilogy of lesbian Vampire films) is not only long on steamy images of Ms. Pitt and friends, it's also a well written, acted and filmed movie. Peter Cushing gives his usual fine performance as the protagonist over whom Pitt literally loses...well, watch the film and see.The DVD has excellent picture and sound, and contains extras such as theatrical trailers and commentaries of both features.A super 2 for 1 bargain for any Hammer, Vampire and/or Ingrid Pitt fan."
3,Countess Dracula / The Vampire Lovers...,"As the price was right for this 2 for 1 package, I went ahead and took a chance on this DVD. Well, at least I got two for one. At best cheesy, the actors seemed to take their craft as seriously as they could without laughing out loud!Oh well, you win some and lose some. I definitely lost this time around!I won't tell you to buy it (or not), get yourself an inexpensive copy (or even better - rent it) and laugh!I rate ""Countess Dracula / The Vampire Lovers"": 3 stars!"
4,Only Two Things in Common,"These pictures have only two things in common, vampires and Ingrid Pitt. Albeit a cult favorite, ""Countess Dracula"" is a botched film marred by weak production values and the downright stupidity of dubbing Ingrid's voice, which destroyed her performance. But in ""The Vampire Lovers,"" Pitt, undubbed, gives a wonderfully crafted, complex and intelligent standout performance. ""The Vampire Lovers"" shows her emotive range and ability to convey non-verbals in a genre that lends itself to chewing scenery, which Pitt never does. It is too bad that the film industry never made fuller use of her talents, but ""The Vampire Lovers"" will be her legacy, not ""Countess Dracula."""
3,Not impressed,"It smoked, flaked and really didn't give much confidence in thus product. If it does so again I may seek a replacement."
2,didn't met my expectations,"When I used this diffuser, it left even more dark spots in my light color stove, then it was before I used it. Yes, it is spreading heat equally, but doesn't protect a pot and stove from smoky stains."
2,materials used,I'm a big fan of Norpro but I don't like the design of this heat diffuser--the handle is made of wood and is not removable. A small change in design would make a big difference.
5,Worked like a charm.,"I used the diffusers on an electric stove under cooking tajines bought in Morocco, for the first time(after seasoning.)I was keeping my fingers crossed not knowing what to expect, and with guests arriving in a short time. The two diffusers I purchased worked like a charm. Food cooked beautifully and nothing cracked! They are well make and very well priced. I looked all over in St. Louis and didn't find such an item. So this website certainly saved the day for me. Shipping time was very fast!"
3,"Good for the price, but finish could have been better.","Works as expected, but the first few uses saw the entire silver coloring come off the surface. Looks very different now, but no problems with the product usage. If the finish is coming out this easily, why put it on at all given the intended use will always be at high temperatures !"
2,Not that great,"For less than $3, I wasn't really expecting much from this -- so I don't feel too bad about the fact that it's destined for the back of the kitchen drawer. I washed the diffuser as recommended, but it still smells up my house when I use it (I think it's the wooden handle -- it's a treated wood kind of smell). While my glass kettle was protected from cracking, the water took even longer to boil than it normally does -- like 20 minutes for maybe 3 cups of water. The bottom of the diffuser was corroded and terrible looking after only a couple of days. I just don't feel good about using this diffuser."
1,why did I try this,I didn't like this at all it turned color the first time I used it and will be getting rid of it.
1,Total crap,I bought two of these and read the item description. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Here are the reasons why I hate this diffuser:1. There are no instructions on how to use this product - never says to use on low heat or anything.2. I used this on medium high heat and it basically got stuck to the electric coil.3. I couldnt wash it as it was falling apart and flaking in my sin4. The middle completely fell off after 1 use.I ONLY USED THIS ONCE - BOTH OF THE DIFFUSERS AND THEY ARE TOTALLY UNUSABLE.It would have been a great help to have some sort of instructions on how to use and how to handle this stupid product. I would not have given this such a low rating if there were some sort of instructions on how to use this porduct. I have other diffusers and they work just fine.
4,Necessary item,These little gizmos are absolutely necessary for anyone cooking on a gas stove--and VERY reasonably priced--what a deal!
1,I'd give it zero if I could..,"Hand washed it, bent the handle, melted some butter in a pot, rinsed it off and let it air dry. Ah hour later, it's rusting out from the inside. Absolutely worthless and it actually left rust stains on the pad it was left to dry on. Flimsy handle, I can't imagine it holding up very long in its current state. Just buy the SimmerMat instead.Simmer Mat Diffuser"
5,Great Little Flame Tamer at a Very Reasonable Price,"Several months ago I acquired a gorgeous Italian glazed terra cotta pot, the kind that you can cook in on top of the stove - if you have a flame tamer. Well, I hunted up every flame tamer on Amazon, read every word of every review and finally decided on thisNorpro 144 Heat Diffuseras what looked to me to be the best value for the money. I've had it for a couple of months now and use it almost daily. It fits both the large and the small burners on my stove (no, the handle does not get in the way) and lets me melt chocolate, simmer chili and use my terra cotta pot (along with some lovely Chinese ones I came across at the Asian store) to my heart's content. I just took a pot of chili off the stove that I had been reheating (unattended) for an early dinner and I won't even need a scrubby to clean the pot.Great return on a small investment!Highly Recommended"
2,Inferior Materials Means you'll need to buy a replacement SOON,"This was great at first. It protected my Morrocan tagine, but it didn't last long. It's rusted thru (and I never got water on it) from use. I only used it 3 years so I guess for 2 dollars a year it's a value, but the handle kept coming off and I need to order a replacement so that I don't ruin my expensive tagine.PS I ordered a cast iron replacement that works well."
4,GREAT FOR GAS,Worked as advertised for my outdoor cookstove. Kept the bottom of the pot from burning my beans and chili.
4,"Dated, but the basics haven't changed.",This book covers the basics very nicely for someone getting started in Solar Power for their RV. I haven't found any newer texts that cover this subject as thoroughly as the Kirkby's have. Other 12 Volt Boat/RV texts I've found barely touch on the subject of solar charging systems for deep cycle batteries.
2,This book is ancient!,"The copyright on this book is 1993. The basics are there, but things like 3 stage charger/converters are not really discussed."
2,author doesn't like Americans,Author should not write on any subject other than British or Australian soldiers. He could have won WW11 much more rapidly on his own.
5,hit me again!,if this song doesn't move you you have no heart. nothing more needs to be said. listen to the song
4,The new Patsy Cline?,"This is a great album. Rimes is sort of a combination of Patsy Cline and Allyson (sp?) Kraus, with the emphasis on the Cline. I can't believe she hasn't had better reviews. Bad management?"
5,Amazing,"This book was absoulutely amazing to me. I read her first book, ""If You Come Softly"", not knowing what to expect. She was a new author to me and i was very impressed. I am fourteen years old and as like many other teenagers i don't really like to read, but i really liked these books. The author really has a way of getting you into the book. I truely didn't want to put it down.The story she told seemed so close to her. You could tell that the topic was something that she could really relate to. I felt aas if I was Ellie. As if I was going through the unbarrable pain that she goes through losing the love of her life."
1,Limited and outdated information in a handy size.,"As a master diver who has dived over 50 years and has visited many of Fiji's dive sites, I would advise any potential diving visitor to save their money here and buy the newer and much more complete Lonely Planet ""Diving and Snorkeling Fiji"" by renowned dive guides Casey Mahaney and Astrid Witte (also available on Amazon). Just be aware- Fiji has so many and varied dive sites visited by day operations and liveaboards NO book can really do justice comprehensively. Nope, no connections with LP or Mahaney, I just want to save other divers the trouble... and if you love diving, you will LOVE Fiji diving!"
2,Mediocre Basic Guide to Fiji Diving,"This book gives limited information on approximately 20 dive sites in Fiji. The descriptions and photos are adequate, but are relatively brief. The book makes few recommendations, but provides a decent place to start rough planning of an independent dive vacation."
5,textured half fold greeting cards,I was very pleased with this product. The shipping was speedy and the quality very good
4,Very good,Nice alternative toHallmark Blank Greeting Cards Half-fold Matte Premium 20 Count. I like to switch out every so often. Highly recommend for making your own greetings.
5,Greeting Cards,"I have been using these for well over a year. I make greeting cards for my church and I have made over 150 for them already this year, as well as my own cards. Made with this paper they look better and richer and are well liked by everyone. They print well and the colors are great. I have used many kinds before I found these. None compared."
4,Greeting Cards,It is fun to make greeting cards when you have the proper materials.Using the Avery Textured half fold cards are perfect. I use both sizes 5.5 x 8.5 AND4.4 x 5.5.
2,Avery Greeting Cards,"I'm disappointed in these Avery greeting cards. They are not scored where they need to be folded. I guess I'll go back to Hallmark greeting cards. They ARE scored where the fold should be and that makes it much easier to fold them. Also, the paper is rather flimsy for a greeting card. I expected more from Avery. I was going to return them but decided I would go ahead and try them when I run out of the Hallmark ones. If you want cards that have a fold score and heavier paper, these are not the ones to get. I will not be buying these again."
5,Custom Cards Made Easy,"Great product, easy to design your own custom greeting cards with the Avery software, or you can download Avery templates and use them in Microsoft Word. Merchant delivered the product quickly and in good shape."
1,Very Disappointed,"I've been making greeting cards for many years, and this product is, by far, the worst I've ever used. The texture is so nubbly that the graphics are distorted, and I had to abandon several ideas because they looked so bad. They are supposed to be white, but are really a strange shade of off-white. But the worst part is that the envelopes won't go through either of my printers. I worked very hard to design a beautiful envelope front, and ended up having to use labels. A lot of these cards went into the recycle bin. I won't buy these again, and neither should you."
5,always a good product,"I make my own family Christmas cards each year using this card stock. It looks great, seems to hold up well, and doesn't jam in my printer. I will continue to use it."
5,greeting cards,I make my own cards and I love the Avery Textured Half Fold Greeting Cards. They make my cards look professional.
1,Avery 's quality has declined!,"I have used this card package for years. This shipment definitely is of poor quality. The stock is so flimsy that it rolls when printed. I have put the printed cards under heavy books to try to flatten them for mailing. I won't order Avery products again!Avery Half-Fold Greeting Cards for Inkjet Printers, 5.5 inches x 8.5 inches, White, Matte, Pack of 20 (03265)"
5,What Prank letters should be!!!,"Most prank letter books are written by a fictitious person. This greatly reduces the humor and purpose of the prank. So far I've only come across two prank letter books written without the cowardly use of a pseudonym. Idiot Letters and Hire Me Dumbass (by Joe Mozian) are both written by real people. Their authors are gifted in the odd art of prank letter writing and accept full responsibility for their actions. While Idiot Letters does get a bit far-fetched on occasion, it is funny. Hire Me Dumbass however is honest from cover to cover, and hysterical to boot. If you are a first timer to prank letter books, both Idiot letters and Hire Me Dumbass are the best places to start."
1,Mildly amusing but hardly worth the purchase,This book is cute but goes on far too long. The author succeeds in showing how you can twit officials in businesses and corporations without their (or their surrogates) catching on for a while (though not always). But he drones on. I recommend that you read it over an expresso in a local store and spend your money on one of Amazon's better book
1,pure junk,"save your money buy a titan brand instead, ratchet skips constantly in one direction i believe you could hurt yourself useing this tool"
2,DOA ratchet,"It seemed used or poor quality construction. It only worked in one direction. Amazon was great, reversed charges quickly and everything else in the order was great."
2,I Like Anna Karenina..But..,"These Cliffsnotes are terrible!! I do not know if they are the old version or what, but there are no distinctions with themes, symbolism, character insight, etc., the only thing there is for each group of chapters is: summary and commentary with no detail in the commentary!! I am an avid cliffsnotes buyer, but this particular book was very disappointing, down to the simple character descriptions."
5,Great birthday gift for Vincent Price fan !!!,"Hard to buy a birthday gift for a 21 year old son , but I knew he would really like this. Great gift for Edgar Allen Poe fans and Vincent Price fans."
1,disappointing,I really made a mistake by buying this item. It is not worth what was charged. There is something working in the background of this company that is keeping the price as high as it is. The 37.00 dollars I spent on this item was a waste. There was only one disc in the box with side A and side B. How cheap. There should of at least been two discs. One for each movie. I was cheated. Hope you listen to this and don't get cheated yourself. Hope this review is not blocked out. People need to know where their hard earned money is going.
5,Souvenir - It's Not Just the Sex,"Souvenir is one of the few movies out there that shines light on one of the hottest themes of today's art world - illegal appropriation of art. Good thing: It doesn't feel preachy. In fact, the film adds a sexy smart to what could be - in less-skilled hands - a potentially dry topic. Beautifully shot, fantastically lit and full of suspense, this film has plenty for everyone -- thrill, mystery, and pure, natural romance. (I love the sweet bicycle ride...awww) NOTE: Director Natasa Prosenc has created some of the steamiest sex scenes I've encountered in cinema! I look forward to more work by this director. MUST SEE!"
1,Pointless release,"Classic songs repackaged to make Geffen a few extra dollars from unsuspecting dolts who are not true fans and wouldn't already own the 1984-1990 WS releases. AND, for those of you suckered into the charm of the liner notes, David Coverdale has publicly stated on his website that the liner notes on this release are inaccurate and did not include ANY of his input. Another cheap Geffen ploy. Coverdale would never have allowed this shameless release other than for the few extra dollars in might bring him in royalites that he so absolutely deserves."
2,porta-nail 2-1/8 t-nail for concrete,"The price is nice, but the strip nails were all broken up--had to lay one-by-one nail in the nailer to use. only 1/5 were in strips"
5,Only My Mouth Is Smiling is a GREAT book!,Jocelyn Riley is an incredible author and her talent really shines through in this novel. This book is about Merle and her brother and sister while their mentally-ill mother drags them away from their home in Chicago to suburban Wisconsin. I totally fell in love with this book and it's a great read for anyone!
4,Cute Book,"I bought this book as just something cute to look at every now & again. I really like the sayings inside, as most of them pertain to my current relationship. I like how I can point out to my fiance and say ""Hey, that's you!""One thing I was not expecting, even though I looked at the 1st couple pages online, was that all of the content is black & white. I think it would have been a little more worth the money if they had added some color, even if it had been to the words (not the pictures).I really enjoy looking through this book and am interested in purchasing more of Gregory Lang's book about Love. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone - it's something you'd use or look at everyday, but I like it for a coffee table book."
3,Nice if you have a perfect marriage,This is a very nice book if you have a really good marriage and have never had your heart broken by your spouse or if your spouse is still romantic all the time and treasures you all the time. There are some marriages like that out there. But not ours. We've definitely had our ups and downs and I can't say that everything in that book speaks true to us.
1,A great greating card,"Lang writes wonderful stuff but should put it in a greeting card for $3.95 not a book. Like his past offerings, ""Why a son needs a Dad"" & ""Why a daughter needs a Dad"", there are pages of photos and one liners. Nothing of real essence, unless it was printed in a greeting card! Not worth the money!"
3,My first AA purchase,"The other day I heard ""No Messin'"" blasting from a system at Circuit City. I dug the groove, so much so that I went out and bought the CD (my first AA purchase). I have to admit that as a player I really love the tune and I admire the musicianship and tightness of the band; however, I find some of the other Radio Contact tunes to be less than inspiring. Of course, I can't speak for their other stuff, but if it's anything like the Radio Contact tunes other than ""No Messin', I might not be all that inspired to do much further listening."
2,mostly disappointing,"I bought this CD based on my love for the track 'No Messin'. I was hoping the rest of the CD would carry the same funky, jazzy feel. I was very disappointed: with only one or two exceptions, the rest of the CD sounds like elevator music."
3,Good to see a new release.,"I'll start off with saying that any Acoustic Alchemy release is welcome & worthy of buying. This CD is pretty much a standard AA release, some superb tracks, some not so great. Tunes like No Messin' & Shelter Island Drive are their classic sound - fantastic. It was interesting to hear female vocals on a tune, and male chorus on another, but I honestly didn't care for it, or buy it to hear that. Coffee With Manni got to be a bit irritating for some repetitive reason. There's good & bad with just about any CD you buy.Overall, a very worthy purchase, nice assortment of styles, and more great tunes to add to your collection. I own all of their CDs, and this isn't their best, some of their tracks have just knocked me off my feet!..but as in my heading, it's always great to see a new release from this class act!"
2,weather channel and nothing more,"This is a real disappointment for a longtime AA fan. If I want vocals, I'll buy Diana Krall or Norah Jones who do it far better than the nondescript voice that appears on one of one of the tracks. If Carmichael is just slumming to test the waters, I can forgive that. But if he plans to relegate AA to the position of backup instrumentals for ordinary vocal talent, then I've bought my last AA cd."
5,Introduction to Acoustic Alchemy,"No Messin' from this CD was my first introduction to Acoustic Alchemy about 5-6 years ago. I was driving along and I was blown away when it came on my XM radio. Bought it right away and haven't ever been disappointed by any of their CD's, even though they all seem to have a different direction. I now own all their CD's and have seen them live 8 times. I never get tired of seeing and hearing them. They are all incredibly talented and are my favorite band in the world!"
3,"Nice watch, but old stock",When I received this watch I said: Nice Timex ! Testing the watch I realized that the light was out of order. A couple of days after the alarm turned off. The battery was finished. The dealer refund me... but what I was looking for ??? I was looking for a Timex not for a refund. So bad.
4,GREAT METAL,A GREAT GERMAN BAND AND A GREAT ALBUM IF YOUR INTO SERIOUS SPEED/THRASH METAL WITH MIDEVIL THEMES
5,Swank!,"This cd is awesome! I can't listen to it enough. My favorite tracks are Nancy Wilson's ""Hello Young Lovers"" and ""The Man That Got Away."" She sings with such intensity. This is the creme de la crop of Vegas performers. Louis Prima, Tom Jones, and Nat King Cole are also great on this disc. If you like the Ultra Lounge series, you'll love this."
3,A Mixed Bag,"THE SEASON FOR ROMANCE finds Lee Ann Womack straying farther from her country base, with mixed results. Much of this holiday set sees Womack surrounding herself with orchestral and big band arrangements, and on occasion it works fine. But more often than not, Womack's lovely though fragile voice is a bit too precious for some of the uptempo numbers--neither 'The Man With The Bag' or 'Baby, It's Cold Outside' stick, and the presence of Harry Connick Jr. on the latter just reaffirms the notion that he's always been a tad overrated. Some of the original numbers, such as the title track and 'Forever Christmas Eve' are pretty solid though, and she's more than convincing on standards like 'The Christmas Song' and particularly 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas'. Ultimately, it's an above average attempt, though one would be better served seeking out holiday releases from Martina McBride or the excellent Linda Eder."
4,"Leisurely, romantic Christmas","Aside from an angelic, sparse take on ""Silent Night"" and the festive, change of pace romp ""The Man With The Bag,"" Lee Ann Womack's Season For Romance is dominated by leisurely paced renditions of modern yuletide classics. The two new compositions (the title track, ""Forever Christmas Eve') are exquisitely rendered, amorous odes that make strong bids for future classic status. The only track that disappoints is Womack's duet with Harry Connick Jr. on ""Baby It's Cold Outside."" While they blend nicely on the rare moments that they sing together, Connick sounds half asleep on his responsive vocals."
3,not what you might be expecting-,"what's up with Lee Ann's breathless whispery vocals on each song? what could've been a great country Christmas CD turns out only as fair middle-of-the-road adult contemporary- listen to her sing ""A Little Past Little Rock"" then listen to this- hard to believe it's the same person! not a bad CD, but something you might expect from someone like Kathie Lee Gifford, not Lee Ann Womack."
2,save your money,"I was disappointed with this album. I hate it when artists remake a song and they change the tempo on the original song. Lee Ann sings ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" and ""What Are You Doing for New Year's Eve"" way too slow. Half of the album sounds like a really bad R & B attempt."
1,Don't buy it!,"This is not typical Lee Ann Womack. She has left her country roots and sold her soul to the devil! The duet with Harry Connick Jr. does her beautiful voice no justice. She sounds like she is trying to sing an R&B Christmas album. Maybe I am partial to traditional Christmas albums, but this one does nothing to satisfy my needs for beautiful Christmas music!"
5,Good Insights,"I will like to congratulate Kishore in approaching this subject in a very thorough and balanced manner. It is very readable and should be recommended reading for all students who intend to further their studies in Asia. Executives who are posted to Asia can take heart that the mindset and thinking of Asians will not be a great ""mystery"" after reading this book.Good work."
5,Fresh point of view!,"Always stuck with what you think of how the West thinks about the world?Need new ideas, new perspectives?Want to know what non westerners might think and desire about how this world should and could evolve?An absolute requirement for those wanting to broaden views, learn and realize that there's more in this world than just the West. There's also the Rest"
2,Provocative title but somewhat disappointing,"Some interesting ideas but the analysis is not that convincing. For example, the further rise of China is far from assured despite current hype."
3,"they say ""assembly required""","I don't know if they didn't when you got yours, but all the ones I've seen say they need to be put together and painted. You just use regular house paint and primer that you'd use on your walls. I don't know if hiring someone to do it was teaching the kid a good lesson; had it been fully assembled, they are still fragile and children need to beware of this. I've done these before, and you need small tools, ie Dremel drill, small pliers, manicure scissors, small wirecutters, and so on. Even as is, the child can still learn a lot be learning to measure, how to sand, and how to be careful with her things; which children don't learn unless they have to put effort into it. It's a gorgeous dollhouse, but what I read said nothing about being assembled or including paint."
1,Impossible to assemble,"My daughter received this doll house for Christmas. My husband and I tried unsuccessfully to assemble it. This is not a project for beginners! We have now hired someone who can hopefully follow the directions and assemble it. The person who bought it thought that it came with all the paint, accessories, etc. It is just a box full of plywood sheets. We are very disappointed in this product."
4,Pretty Good,"I liked the movie it started out slow at first, but It got better. Good sit down and watch with friends or someone special!"
5,Cause for reflection,"Ronald Wright's a Short History of Progress is one of those books that will change your world view. Accessible in size (just 136 pages - although don't forget to read the footnotes which are worth the price of admission alone) the book is a sobering and illuminative look at how humankind's quest for progress has too often ignored the carrying capacity of local ecosystems.This pattern is repeated throughout history destroying societies and ecosystems along the way. But it is the rapid pace of technology and population over the past 300 years that has the potential to completely outstrip the ability of earth. and ecosystems everywhere, to support humankind.Although reading the book is equivalent to realizing that you've been sleeping with a stick of dynamite under your bed. I think it is better to sleep unsoundly with knowledge than to sleep blissfully with ignorance."
2,"Good summary of Easter Island and Mayans, but repetetive. Conclusion is that one political party and ideology are to blame...","I enjoyed the bits on Easter Island and Mayans, but when he concludes that only one American political party are to blame---care to guess which?--- for the coming decline of civilization the book reveals itself for the petty blame game it is.We are ALL to blame and he does have one thing right: Our so civilization is doomed to follow all the others into entropy, disorganization and chaos. Science won't save us. It's greasing the skids.From empire and back to the caves is the well worn way of man. See you there!"
3,Okay if you bear in mind it's very much coffee-table pop science,"This is a readable and interesting alternative look at certain historical events from a specific viewpoint. Wright makes some intriguing connections and raises relevant questions, but this is work is flawed by its superficiality and lack of scholarly rigor. Wright takes some very questionable leaps from evidence to conclusion without really examining more plausible and simple explanations. The links between one conclusion and the next are often tenuous, and whilst the work is highly enjoyable and intriguing, it should be read more as entertainment than a serious work.This is a pleasing, but lightweight work which, on some levels at least, appeals to the vanity of people who like to feel that they are exploring serious issues in depth, without having to do any real intellectual spade-work at all. In short, pop science at both its best and its worst."
1,"Trite and Shallow ""Analysis"" of ""History""","This book came highly recommended, both by some friends and the reviews on this site. In general, I found the book to be a waste of time, and I found the author's 'voice' to be incredibly intrusive and condescending. His big news, that ""All civilizations come to an end"" I learned way back in grade school. I can't count the number of times I've heard about agriculture causing salination, ship building destroying the forests of the Greek Isles, the implications of the mass slaughter of mammoths, etc. He did not present me with any really new material, or provide any insights into what can be done to prevent or stall the collapse of societies. For my money, I'd far rather spend the time with Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" and ""Collapse"", than with this guy."
5,Necessary reading,"It doesn't matter if you're conservative or progressive, religious or not, or even if you agree with Wright's historical methods--this is a book that tells the truth about the great damage that so-called ""progress"" has done to our planet. At the same time that modern medicine is helping people live longer, the exponential population growth of the world, and our post-Industrial revolution madness, are seriously eroding our planet and wiping out the creatures that live on it, faster than we know. Read the book, and when it comes to your city or your netflix, see the movie. Then simplify simplify simplify."
5,Quick Study of Human History,"Wow. What a fantastic, smart, accessible read. Artfully written as well. While always interested in human history, I've often responded dispassionately to books about former civilizations because the relevance felt lacking. But by comparing the progress of varying civilizations while also looking at the progress of *all* civilization, relevance screams like a siren. Wonderful book and very accessible for the average reader."
3,Belabouring the Point,"The ideas presented are very interesting and the downfall of the civilizations that Wright presents in his argument certainly demonstrate a consistent pattern. However, halfway through the book, the themes seem to be a bit over done and no positive solutions are presented.I typically enjoy reading books that challenge our way of living or present an alternate perspective, which I think this book succeeds in, but where it falls short is providing proposed solutions. It's always easy to point out problems, but proposing small incremental solutions that everyday people can act on would make this a real winning book."
5,Ma (a masterpiece),I cannot believe I am the first one to make an online review. But this rounded thing really deserves a prize. Franco
3,Ma is alright.,I remember loving the long song 'Ma' a lot. It is kind of dated now but I can get through this cd without changing discs.
3,Not to good album cover.,"It's good to listen to something different, if you want listen to something different give this CD a try. If your into the 70's give this CD a try."
5,Rare earfh !#?,"If you enjoy 70's rock and roll, definitely give this cd a shot. Try it, you'll like it ! It's fantastic !"
5,Dont be talkin bout my Ma!,"A friend of mine introduced me to a few dandy albums back in the day. Big John really stuck in my head when I heard this. When ever you throw this on at a part with hot women there, they always get really relaxed when Come with Me starts up and plays. Of course they have to make it sound like they are embarrassed but hey everyone knows what it is all about!Totally a groove album. I have the vinyl that of course is excellent sounding.The CD I can handle just because it is one of the best albums made. Sit down with shots of tequila and Dos Equis beer and listen."
4,"""Goodbye"" is their best ever song","""Goodbye"" is definately the better of all Spice Girls songs. It shows how far they have come from their beginnings...they are now sounding much more mature. I have to admit though, that I do enjoy some of their songs, but this song is a definate turning point, hopefully in the right direction. ""Christmas Wrapping"" is a fun Christmas song, and the two live tracks, ""Sisters are doin' it for themselves"" and ""We are family"" were recorded Sept 1998 at Wembley Stadium, London. A must for all Spice-a-holics!"
5,shared subject,"We are particularly excited with the comments, suprisingly coincident with our book 'Immune Crossover' 1998 that already converted into a fourth edition. I'll start reading today to review it later"
1,cake pans,you buy cake pans that are 10 inches and you put a cake circle in the pan and it does not fit.i measure the pan and it is 9 1/2 inches. so i have to send them back. they should learn to use a tape measure .
2,Trying to rip off glassjaw...Ugh!,"Stop trying to rip off glassjaw!!! Two starts because ""last train home"", &,"" goodbye tonight"" are two good songs but the rest of this album is pure crap. Don't buy it!!PS:I know glassjaw is an amazing band but why try to rip them off for ? Loserssssss...."
2,[2.5/5] A very average album.,"You can tell when a band is all-commercial if you listen to it. This is one of such cases. They have the potential to be good, however Lostprophets have no soul behind their music. Their songs are very predictable, being based on one pattern. They have no originality, every minute I thought ""Wait, didn't I heard that before?"". It's one of those examples of a bunch of friends jumping on a band-wagon (nu-metal/alt-rock in this case) and after a successful demo, being signed on by a major studio. The results are usually bland, uninspired albums. As I said, they have potential, though."
2,Really really bad,"I actually liked them a lot better when they where an Incubus imitation. The Fake Sound of Progress ranks next to Incubus's amazing SCIENCE and it showed a band that was clearly not original(and very wannabe American) but did a good job excecuting their sound.But now nu metal is no longer cool. The bass player traded his Warwick for a Fender jazz bass and plays with a pick instead of his slap-funk style. The DJ is a now a keyboard player who wears eyeliner and tries to look like the guy from My Chemical Romance. The guitar players ditched the PRS's for Fenders and Gibsons and seem to liberally borrow from 80's thrash metal(another curren trend). They all look like hardcore/metalcore kids now. And the hair? My oh my...the hair, and the clothes. These guys are serious fashion victims, image-wise and musically."
2,Lostprophets pious little secret...,"The other reviewers have pretty much covered the sound of the new album (poppy punk/alt rock/electronic) and made apt comparisons to like bands (Incubus, Linkin Park, et al) but what they are ALL suspiciously omitting is that this band is one of those SNEAKY CHRISTIAN BANDS that appropriates the attitude and sound of hard edged, alternative rock and uses it as a vehicle to deliver their pro-Jesus propoganda.... not that there's anything wrong with that, but it is a bit of a breach of contract, if you ask me. Non-Christians: buy at your own risk."
1,crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"dont buy this cd...it is godawful! buy the fake sound of progress, it is umpteen times greater than this. i dont know hat happenend to these guys, but FSOP was on of the most amazing cd's i had heard in a while, this one sounds like generic emo/radio metal. these guys can still be great though, as long as they dont ever release anything that sounds remotely close to this crap."
2,Best To Avoid,"It's my own fault. I made the mistake of purchasing a cd based on the first song on the album. It's not bad. Perky lil' number. However, the rest of the album is pretentious and very inconsistent. And they look like fancy boys too, groomed for stardom. Well, not with this sorry album blokes!Maybe they should've advertised to the pre-teen girl market. Amazon should recommend this album to Lizzie McGuire fans (they're too young to know better)."
1,Trend hopping pretty boys,"This Welsh band is a good example of what's wrong with music. I mean, when they first came out they went under the LOZT PROPHETZ. Now they try and dress like Eighteen Vision and Poison the Well fans when back then they could have passed as concert goers at a Limp Bizkit show.Annoying vocals(there is only ONE Mike Patton), so-so guitars, bland bass and drum work and what's with the keyboards??? Didn't this guy used to a turntablist a little while ago?Maybe when there next album comes around they'll be sounding like the Darkness.Please go listen to Fugazi, Helmet or Led Zeppelin."
1,These guys should get 'lost'.,I heard this in my friend's car. I hated it. I think this is a horrible CD. I wouldn't recommend it.
4,"Just don't hold it up to ""Fake Sound of Progress"" standards","Most reviewers lament that this Lostprophets album doesn't quite measure up to their debut, an opinion with which I would agree. All the same, this is by no means a bad record simply because it isn't a perfect extension. This album has a number of very intricate tracks, particularly ""A Million Miles"" and ""Sway"". The real difference is in the tone; while ""The Fake Sound of Progress"" was rather stark and violent (i.e., the track ""Five is a Four Letter Word""), this album is much more upbeat.No, this isn't the same; just don't let that reality ruin this experience for you."
3,RE: The New LP?,I love the song 'Make A Move'. This albums quite good but no way are Lost Prophets the new LP. Linkin Park will always be better in my opinion.In Lost Prophets song 'Last Summer' they have used the same guitar tune as Linkin Parks song 'Papercut'. Listen to both the full lengh tracks and you will see what I mean.
5,Something diffrent,"I've been listing to lost prophets since back in 01 when they released their debut album ""fake sound of progress""( amazing album). I'd have to say this album is right up there with it. They experimented alot with their sound and style which is awesome. I must say they are a kick a** band to see live as well so. Buy this album then go see them play! You won't be dissapointed!"
5,lostprophets are where it's at!,"I have to admit, i wasn't amazed by this album when i first bought it. It's just one of those CD's that have to grow on you. Fortunately, this didn't take long! I gave it a few days AND I LOVE IT!""Start Something"" is a rare album i have which i can just put in my CD player and let it run the whole way through without skipping any songs. All the songs are just excellent! Catchy guitar riffs, pounding drums, amazing vocals...lostprophets have it all! And ""Start Something"" shows their talent to create great rock songs at it's best.If you're having doubts about buying this album, hear me out when I say IT ROCKS!!! Truly worth buying."
5,from a hip hop /nu metal fan,"Ive been familiar with the band since fake signs of progress , but i did'nt take much notice until they dropped this. It starts off really strong with 5-6 great tracks , and ends again great.""last train home"" probably pushed me to buy it , but then i heard stuff like make a move. The lp did not disapoint me in no way , to be honest there are hardley any bad tracks .Well the best ;last train homewe still kill the old wayswayto hell we ridemake a moveburn burn [ok]were godzilla ya japanlast summerstart somethingmillion milesso u can tell its a good record.I liked it cuz i listen to stuff likemetallica [now and again]linkin parkkorndeftonespodratm[besides rap]personnaly id give it a try."
4,Nice CD,"I never really heard of Lost Prophets before I got this CD. I like it... Some parts get too slow for me, but overall I think it's worth a look."
3,Teen mall punk with suprising attitude,"Lostprophets are a band whose songs almost stay in your head upon listening to them, but don't quite make it. For all their heavily distorted riffs, dynamic lead guitars, and melodic vocals, the group lacks that memorable spark needed to distinguish themselves from their peers in the extreme sports era suburban punk rock field. As displayed in the classical string arrangements in 'A Million Miles' and the powerhouse guitar solo in 'I Don't Know', it's obvious that a substantial amount of effort was put into the production of the album, yet the disc still seems somewhat bland. Listening to Start Something, I couldn't help but get the feeling that the anthemic single 'Last Train Home' is just sweet sounding bait for a record that's merely average. By no means is Start Something a bad album, just one that lacks definition."
2,No way,"I discovered ""Progress"" when it first came out, and I was very much impressed. So impressed that I decided to pick up a copy of ""Start Something"" blindly without even listening to it. BIG mistake. The first thing I noticed was that the unstructured, sporadic melodies of the first album had given way to radio-friendly, almost pop-punk songs. The turntables and percussion that blended so perfectly in the first album have almost been completely erased. The guitar riffs are stupid and predictable. Think ""Hoobastank - The Reason"" from Britain and you pretty much have ""Start Something"". Yet another example of a great underground band being ravaged to conform to the radio. ""Progress"" is 100 times better than this album, pick up a copy of it instead and relive the days of when Lostprophets was a band with potential, before they took the road to mainstream."
4,pretty good,This is a very good CD and since I bought it it has hardly left my CD player. I love the single Last Train Home like most people and like many people I was disapointed with the rest of the CD at first but it grows on you quickly. To Hell We Ride is an awesome song as are most of the others. Last Train Home is the best hands down though and the only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I will probably grow tired of it soon but I will go back and listen to it just not as often as I do now
5,Wake up... Wake up... MAKE A MOVE buy this CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It's time for you to get up and make a move ... a move to buy the new LostProphet CD... It is 5* quality band and their extreme lyrics and lead vocalist deserves 10 STARS!!!! MAKE A Move is an inspiring track.. as well as all the other sick tracks... Another plus about this band is unlike other punk metal bands.. there is NO OBNOCTOUS SCREAMING which makes this band a ear appealing hard punk Metal BAND of the Millenium!!!!!Keep Rockin..... MAke YOUR MOVE, buy this CD!!!!!"
2,Huge Let Down,"After hearing this band being hyped up on the local radio station and online I decided to check them out. I figured and band coming out of the same town in Wales that Tom Jones came from has to have some redeaming quality about that. I was wrong. This CD was a huge let down. This band sounds the same as 4 or 5 other band in wide play right now. Maybe they'll find thier own voice in a few years, but save your money. Don't but this CD, invest in some real music."
2,I expected a whole lot more,"This is really not a good album, and The Lost Prophets are really not that good of a band. I heard 'Last Train Home' on the radio and like most people I thought it was a good song, infact I thought it was a great song and I still do. But anyways so I went out and bought the album and boy was I let down, ""Last Train Home"" and the first song on the album are the only good songs, I thought this was gonna be a good band but instead its just another pop band wanting to be punk.Stay away from this album and this band as both of them are really, really, really bad! Go by the single for 'Last Train Home' instead!"
4,Some Navy guy,"what is wrong with christian bands, look at P.O.D they are a prefect example, they don't use swear words, but they are still a great band."
2,Lame,"This cd was such a let down. All the creativity that their first cd had as been sold for more fame and more money. This cd is not a terrible cd but it pales in when compared to FSOP. All the emotion is gone and there is hardly screaming. LostProphets had a ton of potential, they could have been one of the better bands as far as being creative goes. Unfortunatly they elected the more the path that prophets more(pun indended). Now they are going to be a band that is seen on TRL and heard on the radio all the time. The deserve it but I think they suck. Glassjaw forever."
2,Sorry to be so sterotypical,"but... Its ok, bit over produced I think, the sound is far to clean and it lost some of its edge. On the whole a sell out album with a bunch of self important pretty boys, who only got money the first time around because of the whole ""nu-metal"", rock being cool all of a sudden thing. There first album showed promise but they mellowed too much. Oh well I guess they made a lot of money heh? Plus what is with all the American setting videos? I thought they were Welsh! Hopefully it will be a stepping stone for people into better bands, alternatively just ignore my ramblings ;-)"
5,"when i like something, i really like it.","and this is one of the many albums that I LOVE. WHO cares if there's too much screaming? It has soo much meaning to its songs, and I mean 'WAKE UP' included. This rocks, and personally, I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind lots of screaming and lots of good music.The best track in this album, 'Last Train Home', I found it a little sweet, a little moody, a little head banging and just good rock. Like I said, its lyrics exude a story of its own, and its just one of the best tracks in the world. 'Make A Move' is also worth a listen.Enjoy this one."
4,The next Linkin Park? You're kidding me right!!!,"Linkin Park are so 2000 and anyway they're nu-metal these guys do emo.This has got to be the first album I've listened to all the way through and actually like all of the tracks which is unusual for me as I more often than not skip tracks to the ones that I prefer. But I don't think I can say that there is a track that I don't like.""Goodbye Tonight"", ""Start Something"" and ""We Still Kill The Old Way"" are all great songs with excellent riffs. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that they are very influenced by the way Americans produce their music and have added samples and interludes in between their songs. Maybe they should stick to their roots, be different and not follow the mainstream international market. That's just a minor thing though other than that the album's great and I may have to buy a new copy as my other one has worn out now. lol!"
5,Start Something shows what they are made of.,Lost Prophets showed what they are made of with this album. The good music starts and never stops. Between every song there is no pause but instead a good beat going to keep the music flowing to your ears. It has it really hard moments then it has slower times between songs so you can get ready for the next song. I recommend this album for any of you that liked their last album or/and if you have a sound system around you. The music hits you in every way. I just can't stop listening to it. If you wanna be rockin buy it.
3,Why is it so hard................,".....for a band with potential to stay original. I'll give this one 3 stars only because I loved TFSOP and I can see (hear, whatever) that this band truly loves to play and enjoys what they do. But, TFSOP just showed so much more of what this band could really do. This album just seems so contrived and it just feels so......manufactured, for lack of a better word (think American Idol; 3 seasons and a confirmed 4th, meh!!). I just wish bands would give themselves a little longer to catch on before they move on to trying to please the MTV audiences. There is some merit on this CD: Make A Move, Burn Burn, I Don't Know, Start Something, Sway, and the lead single, Last Train Home are decent tracks but as a whole this album is just not on par with what you know this band can do. If you can get it on the cheap (i.e. $10) pick it up just to support them, otherwise skip it."
4,Start Somthing: For the Second Time,"I'm sure many people that have bought this CD bought it for one reason, Last Train Home. In my opinion this track, though catchy, is not the best song on the Album. This song plays toward the Good Charlotte and pop ""punk"" crowd a tad bit too much.I actually think that this CD, generally speaking, is more like Incubus and Thrice (maybe a combination of both). The sound of this band is not really unique when you stop and listen to it, but what this CD lacks in originality it makes up for with pure energy (Burn,Burn and Start Somthing). I encourage people to look into the Lostprophets more and make their own decision.Also Try- Incubus, Thrice, Death Cab For Cutie (just kidding)Best Track- Sway, a very experimental and creative track."
3,Nothing Stellar,"Start Something is a good cd, but it just doesn't have the pizazz of tfsp. The lyrics seem to lack in places and drag in others, while the instrument work is pretty bland, with the exception of the sampling. Overall, it's pretty generic, but it should keep you entertained for at least a few listens."
2,Definately a Disappointment,"It is pretty simple to sum up. I think this Album is a let down. Unfortunately Lostprophets have resorted to some new refined form of production and have abandoned the style of music which set them above the rest of the crowd. I regret buying this CD. The Fake Sounds of Progress, their first album, was entirely unique, very complex, and overflowed with energy and passion. The lastest release sounds like something they made in a rush and with the desire to sound like every other band on the market. Too bad. Painfully mediocre."
5,Neat,"This is a good CD, similar to the fake sound of progress, but less experimental, which is neat, go lostprophets!"
2,Dissapointed,"Now, when I went to the store to buy this album, i was extremely excited and anxious to pop it into my cd player and just jam. But I was rudely dissapointed.This album from what I've heard so far (which is the whole thing through about 3 times now), is nothing at all spectacular. I really like Last Train Home, and thought that the rest of the songs would at least resemble that. But again, dissapointed. What I was met with was something completely different than TFSP - which is what LP promised and i knew this - and i despise it.I love EVERY track on TFSP but none of the songs on SS even compare. What Im hearing in a lot of the songs on the cd esp. #5 i believe, is a reincarnation of old Incubus. This saddens me, because i really dont like Incubus!Anyways, the cd took a lot of time and effort and i understand this - they worked very hard - but it's not my cup o' tea. I give it 2 stars."
3,"Not awful, not great","I'm gonna give it 3 stars, just cuz they are nice guys.. but seriously, what happened to having your own sound? I feel like each track has the potential for being a good song, but overproduction, over-simplification, and toning down the distortion have not helped the overall package of this band. One of the previous reviews nailed it when he said, I would not give this band another moment's notice if I heard this along with all the other bullsh*t on the radio; the reason TFSOP was awesome was because ShinobiVDragonNinja was one of the most impactful radio singles I'd heard in a long time. LPS were also one of the few bands that incorporated a DJ in a proper fashion. Now, it's all the same, just like everything else that sucks. Oh well, at least the last track is dope."
1,Horrible!,Just horrible! Very poor quality throughout. And it says it is approximately 2 hours of video when in fact it is the same 30 minute film repeated 4 times. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
5,Better than any self teach book or video,This software is great to use. Much easier than a book as you have video to accompany the lessons and like videos you don't have the same controls and ease of use as this software. I spent 1 1/2 months on a self teach book and got through basic notes and chords but was confused. Within one night of this software i was playing real music :) Well worth the 24 bucks for it.
3,Jane's Addction's Home video (by themselves),"It's pretty funny and you get the idea of what Jane's Addiction is. It contains the Mountain Song music video and a song by Perry and Dave just for this video, ""City song"". This is a must for every Jane's fan. END"
2,Kiss this Perry Farrell!!!,"I worked as a record store clerk back in the late 80's and remember we got this video as a promo. It was my first introduction to Jane's Addiction, who by now had a pretty serious buzz surrounding them. It's been a while but I remember what obnoxious poseurs they all came off as. Some of the scenes include one dude being interviewed as he's taking a dump, another beats an eel against the floor. It seemed like they were all trying too hard to shock. On the plus side, the video does include the uncensored version of Mountain Song. For fans only."
5,"don't know much about alternators, but...","... had a problem with my suburban, and was so tired of paying hundreds of dollars for every little thing - that, and the fact that my other car (a bronco II) wasn't working (I need a second car to drop off my car at the mechanic - live in rural upstate NY) - so I search for step by step instructions online, found amazing ones with pictures and even the size of the tools to use, order this unit, and voila - ready to change it, I realized the main screw (that holds the positive cable) was broken, due to unproper packaging. Wrote to amazon, they sent another one next day, I popped it in, and the car's been working fine since - like, 2 months ago? I also changed the belt in the process. It all cost me about 110 dollars, and it would've cost nearly 400 + hassle if I had done it in the shop. Can't go wrong with this."
3,Too clumsy,I did not like the look and feel of the product. Decided to throw it out and be careful with the phone!
1,IT BROKE,"The chargers worked great but if you are buying this for the Covers. Don't. Out of the three i bought two of them broke within the first week. One of which ruined the phone becuase is put a ridiculous amount of pressure on the program button on the side of the phone. These covers were poorly made and when buying a cover please look for ones that don't have the clip things on the side, just look for the ones that are smooth and wrap around. anyone would be much happier. Once again these cover were poor at best."
3,well..,"I got what I paid for not really complaining, but the clear case broke when in less than a week. Also it did not fit properly. The top edge near the camera on one side hit the back side when you open the phone. Also the car charger kind of works but the phone keeps saying ""Unauthourized Charger"" and then won't charge. Also when it is charging it doesnt do a whole lot of charging, left for over 5 hours plugged in it still had not reached a full charge. But it was a cheap set that would be great for teenagers as they happen to destroy and lose things anyway. You could buy a hundred of these and still not break the bank. Also company shipped fast and gave me 15% off my next purchase. Amazon was also great."
5,A winner in more ways than one...,"Yes, this book won the 1999 Caldecott Medal. It certainly deserves it. The illustrations are gorgeous. Snowflake Bentley goes beyond being a pretty picture book. It gently introduces children to a man who followed his passion. He pursued his interest in snowflakes even when those around him found his hobby more than a little odd. As you and your children read this book, you'll learn about snowflake patterns. Oh, if only Bentley had lived to know that science has identified the identical snowflakes he searched for all his life."
5,Snowflake Bentley,This is the amazing story of W. A. Bentley. Jacqueline Martin has captured his life in a beautiful story that my students adored. It left them wanting to learn more about snowflake photography.
3,A good starter.,"I bought this book for my granddaughters. Of course, they havent't seen it yet, it's for Christmas. But I read it and it left me wanting to see more of his photgraphs."
4,Everyone is Special,"I enjoyed reading the story of Snowflake Bentley. He lived many years ago and found snowflakes and nature amazing. His wish in life was to catch photographs of these spectacular creations and share them with the world. His photographs eventually were made into a book for all to enjoy, but it wasn't long after that his life ended. Snowflake Bentley would have to watch from the heavens above to see people enjoying his photographs.I think middle grade children that need to write a book review on a person might find the story interesting, but in truth it is a bit slow moving and not very animated. If history and nature are your passions then this is a story for you and your little one.By Kerri J. BusteedAuthor of Will's First HuntWill's First Hunt"
4,Gifted and Talented Book,This is a good book pick for creating connections for gifted and talented kids to a real-life character. He was passionate about snowflakes and invented photography techniques.
3,Snowflake Bentley,This book was wonderful! The illustrations were amazaing and really made an addition to the enjoyment of the already great story. Terrific Book!
2,Not for young children,Not as interesting as I had hoped for a 5 year old.Bentley dies in the end...The end.(As do we all.) Even tho his photos live onI didn't find enough enthusiasm.
2,How do they figure the Caldecott Award?,"Of all the children's books I have borrowed/read, this has to be one of the best bedtime stories. I was yawning by page two, and I wasn't even tired. My daughter was looking around the room & sighing while I read it. Do the Caldecott judges keep children in mind when they award these books?While I can appreciate the idea of living your dream, no matter the cost, the ""tale"" itsself was drawn out, boring and choppy. The story could have been told & illustrated with *much* more whimsy, for such an interesting fellow/life. I can imagine what a great book this could have been."
3,Matter of taste,"If you hate computerized, high techno type music, then this ain't for you. However, there are the early rap classics ""Zulu Nation Throwdown"" which truly captures the feeling of how early rappers sounded on the streets and playgrounds before hip hop hit it big and ""Jazzy Sensation"" with it's singalong lyrics and funky takeoff on Gwen McCrae's ""Funky Sensation."" However, once Bam got hooked on Kwaftwerk and high-tecno Eurobands, well.... it was very popular at the time, but haters of techno should beware!"
4,Almost Perfection,"This CD has almost everything. The early hits with Zulu Throwdown was just an appetizer to whet the true-schooler's appetite,then you can feast on Planet Rock, Looking for the Perfect Beat,etc. The only letdown was it did'nt have Play It At Your Own Risk, a couple of songs at the end of the collection could have been left off. But in my opinion its money well spent."
4,Had TO get it! Has Looking for The Perfect and Planet Rock(Original)!,"I had to get the cd just for Planet Rock And Looking for the perfect beat, has some other good ones. But just for those two it was worth it for me.Recommend it very much."
2,Not worth the money,My children were expecting something that you could actual see something alittle closer. It is called a telescope!!!!!!!!! They are very disapointed. It is definally NOT worth the $20 we spent on it! It isn't worth more then $10. We still put it up in their fort but they make a comment about how it doesn't work eveytime they use it.
5,Kids LOVE IT,My kids LOVE this toy. It's also a make shift bull horn since it has no lens in it. They spend hours imagining they're pirates & ship captains
5,Get the long version,"I live in Australia. There is a CD store in Brisbane who specialise in rare and deleted music and they sell a Rare Earth CD with a version of Get Ready that lasts for a bit over 21 minutes. You can buy the CD from their site ...- it costs about $..., but if you are in America or any country that isn't third world, it'll cost you pretty much nothing. They'll have to pay you for buying it probably - we have a fantastic economy here."
4,Watch this movie!,"Troll is without a doubt the best of its genre. The genre I'm referring to, however, is ""Horror Movies So Bad That They're Unitentionally Funny."" I have watched an untold amount of horrible horror movies in my day, and this one has brought me to tears (the good king) unlike any other. From Lassie's mom as a witch with an inexplicable talking plant, to Sonny Bono's classic demise, to the operatic interlude, this movie is unbelievable. You must watch this movie!The only reason I'm not giving this movie five stars is because the sequel isn't fantastic, probably three stars, though it does have its moments."
1,Too Pathetic - Even For Me!,"It's a joke in my family that I love to watch really corny, ridiculous and below B movies. ""Troll"" is one of those and I love it. But ""Troll 2"" is, without a doubt, the absolutely worst movie I have ever seen! My Pomeranian could do a better job of acting and would probably be more entertaining! I had to force myself to watch this so I could do a review. I wish they had a negative star rating. I am at a loss for words, so just let me say this: If you enjoy incredibly lousy acting, unbelievably stupid people, and truly pathetic, unfunny and idiotic jokes, then go ahead and waste your money and time watching ""Troll 2"". But, remember - I gave you fair warning!"
3,Troll/Troll 2 but Really Just Troll 2,Length:: 1:49 MinsI made the video cause I didn't want to write much. In keeping with that.........
3,Troll2 should stay in nilbog,"Troll is a great fantasy romp that had me pleased. Featuring for its time great special effects for a B movie. The acting quality isnt great but top notch none the less. I rate that movie a 4/5. Now there is Troll2. This is one of those movies I wanted to turn off. I know of its cult status among fans so i thought i would give it a shot. Bad idea. That movie has such bad acting, plot holes, stupid story, and some of the worst dialouge ive ever heard outside of a high school drama class. So basically Toll is great while Troll2 is its younger brother that sucks. I give Troll2 a 2/5. So basicaly this combo deserves a 3/5 because while troll is great and by itself could have gotten a 4/5 its broght down to a 3 due to the fact that troll2 was so remarakbly bad."
3,Spin on fantasy,I have to say that I did not like troll 2 as much as I did the first one. The first troll I saw when I was a kid and was completely fraked out. As an adult it's still kinda freaky but good. I really like the first one the second one not so much.
2,Stay away!,"Just GOD AWFUL! I'm a big fan of goofy horror, but come on! Gimme some violence, some gore, something! Michael Moriarty if a favorite of mine, but he has nothing to work with in Troll. He's wasted!"
3,One decent the other shouldn't have been made,"Have you ever seen a film an said ""i hope they don't make a part two and should leave things the way they are!""...well, this is how these two films are. Troll was not a bad film (but, not great either), however, it had some moments of being funny and others times dropping the ball, but, to be honest, Troll it self is sure to stand alone. Now, for Troll 2..its a stinker, this movie shouldn't have been made at all and should have just left it alone without the part 2. Anyways, if you seem that you need this film, get it for ""Troll"" only and if you can stomach part 2 then bring the pillow and hope for the best. Rental Only"
4,"Grandpa, are you in hell?","My word what a piece of crap. Drago Floyd, Drake Floyd, or whatever name he uses (check [...], he's too embarrased to use his real name so he creates alternative names). This man has to be the smartest person alive. I mean where did he get his degree in film, from a cracker jack box. His parents have to be pissed that they wasted money sending him to school. If I were his dad I would've beaten him. I don't want to give too much away because you have to see this movie for yourself, but here is an example of how great this movie is. The main kid uses bologna as a weapon to fight off the goblins. Not even Judd Apatow could've come up with something that funny. Please, while watching this movie always keep your mind open that you are about to see one of the most retarded movies of all time. Trust me I kept this in mind, and I cannot think of a time that I laughed so hard at a movie."
3,Review For Troll,"I'll begin by saying that I have not seen Troll 2, but I just saw Troll on TV and since Troll is only available with Troll 2 on DVD, this is the only way I can review it. Troll has an enjoyably goofy first half, but the second half just didn't do it for me. The first half is very funny, although I don't know if it's intentional or not. In the first half, we get Sonny Bono acting horribly, Michael Moriarty dancing horribly, and a girl who is possessed by an evil troll biting people. But the second half is just too serious to be any fun. Charles Band produced Troll. He is the president of Full Moon Entertainment and has either produced or directed a ton of movies that are just as schlocky as this one. A remake of Troll is supposedly in the works, and it is scheduled to be directed by John Carl Buechler, who also directed the original. Let's hope it is a lot more fun than what this one turned out to be."
5,The Most Painful Movie I Have Ever Seen,"I purchased this DVD as a gift for my little brother who had heard that Troll 2 was one of the worst movies ever made. I had no idea just how horrible the movie was. I attempted to watch the whole thing through but I failed because the plot, script, and acting was so ridiculously bad. I managed to finish it a few months later and I must say the plot had some serious twists and the parts that were meant to be funny sometimes did make me chuckle, a painful I can't believe they just did that chuckle but a chuckle nonetheless. It is amazing what they do with corn in this movie. It did however deliver what my brother was looking for by being an all around failure. Troll 1 I didn't watch and I don't think my little brother did either although it had a much higher budget and was probably a more cohesive film. I highly recommend this product as a gift to a male friend however I don't think most girls would appreciate it. It is not a date movie!"
3,Need a good laugh?,"2 Movies for the price of one! Not! Dont' be fooled, you're paying for one movie because the so called ""sequel"" is a pile of dung. But back to Troll... Play this when you had a bad day at school or work to get cheered up. Seriously, for a good laugh and some decent storytelling, pop this baby in. It may be considered a ""bad"" movie by most,but it's a funny bad and can't be missed if you want to just see idiocy onscreen. As a child I actually enjoyed it, now as an adult I just amuse myself by how laughably silly the movie is. A strange inclusion of Sonny Bono in his apartment getting attacked by a Troll is priceless entertainment. There is actually some decent acting, but most is the epitomy of bad, so dont' expect any academy awards for anything. Overall, it's silly watchable stupidity. Kids will love it. Adults won't believe that people pay money to see this. ""Laughing""."
1,TROLL 2 THE WORST OF THE WORST OF THE WORST,"saw troll 2 on hbo back in 1992 or 1993.this movie is painfully boring.painful to watch.couldnt watch this with a migraine.people avoid this one.if u like a troll movie go with the first one.not the second.bad acting,bad scenes.too bad period.this is only for people who adore bad flicks.i just cannot do this one.also the opening credits music scared me half to death.i thought for a minute those goblins were right there beside me.this is a bad movie i dont care for."
3,"Troll, A Great Film.....But.........","Troll is an awsome film and I loved it, that's why I purchesed this dvd. But......the thing I didn't like is1. The lack of special features2. They should realese Troll sepretI HATED Troll 2. It was easly one of the worst movies ever. I bought this cause I knew they wouldn't realese these movies sepret. Troll 2 is so popular and I don't know why. The special affects are so crappy, the acting is horrible, and the plot STINKS. This is in the top ten worst movies in my opinian. But the real deal in this is Troll. The first one is no where near the stupid and gay sequel. The acting is great, the plot is average and the special affects are awsome. I hope they realese these films sepret, so all the people who hate the second and arn't buying this will be happy. I bought this cause I love Troll. So, I really hate to say this but, buy at your own risk or do what I do, pretend that Troll 2 isn't even on that same disk."
1,great in thought,"i purchased the auto rewind along with a regular snap line, i thought the auto rewind could be a useful feature. long and short after playing with it for a while dry there is no need to put chalk in it as i will never use it.they advertise 30 or 32 feet of line but to get past 24' you need to unwind the spring then rewind the spring to get the line to auto retract, then it acured to me that like my tape measure when rewinding i put some finger pressure on the tape to stop it from ""slamming"" into the case - if i do that with a chalk line i will have a mess. i think the clear case and steel mixing ball might be a good idea but i will never know for sure"
5,Stylish Knits for Dogs,This book is great! I have never made a sweater before. And totally understood the patterns and had excellent results for my little grandpuppy. Highly recommend this book. It's great fun.
1,Very Disappointed,"Some patterns are not accurate, looking at the picture. Page 48, the pattern is completely different than what is shown in the picture. I've been knitting for over 50 years, and this is the worst waste of $25.00 for a pattern book I have ever come across. I emailed the publisher, but have yet to hear back."
1,Where are the sleeve patterns?????,"What a disappointment!!! I particularly loved the peruvian and arron sweaters, but to my dismay, the pattern for the patterned fronts was NOT included, NOR were the patterns for the sleeves. This is the worst written knitting book I have ever seen (do we still have proof readers and/or pattern testers in the business???). I do hope that the author spends some time correcting these horrible errors, and offers the resultant pages free to those unfortunates who purchased her pricey book."
2,not worth it,"this book is not worth the $15 plus shipping i paid. the patterns are not well written at all. i appreciate the fact that the author is a long time knitter of pet knitwewar, but what i don't understand is why these patterns in particular were allowed to be published. don't they have focus groups where knitters come in to test out the patterns - - and this shouldn't include knitting friends of the author. if you want to knit for your pet, try another book."
4,Great for cat sweaters!,"I purchased this book at a half-priced store and it was worth what I paid for it. I have made several sweaters from these patterns for my 9 lbs. Sphynx cat. I have had to modify the patterns a bit in length, but most are easy enough that a knitter of medium skill could make the adjustments. There are no high-difficulty skills involved in these. The basic shape of most of the sweaters is the same so construction similar for most of them. I am able to make a little sweater in a day or so. As with any clothing, you need to swatch your yarn choice and measure the animal for a correct fit. The pictures are cute and colorful. I personally prefer knitting books to be spiral bound but you get what you pay for."
1,dogged,"Despite the author's self-aggrandizing introduction and apparent ""pedigree,"" this book is very disappointing. The patterns are very cute, but the sizing is questionable. With perfect gauge, I am knitting one of the sweaters inlarge"" for my 30-pound cocker spaniel. I will be amazed if it fits. The author's idea of small, medium, and large dogs is whacked. Also, under""materials"" for each pattern, the amount of yarn listed is WAY off. I can make these patterns work, as an expert knitter, with a lot of adjustment, but, really, what a pain. Listing these as projects for a new knitter is an epic fail, as the author is a very mediocre technical writer, no matter how fond of herself the intro makes her sound."
4,Stylish Knits For Dogs,"This book of sweaters to knit for dogs has many cute ideas, and generally, the sweaters fit true to size. The only problems is that the directions are not absolutely clear, and do not advise the knitter of the finer points of knitting or finishing. A beginner needs more direction in order to end up with a fine finished product."
5,Simply Beautiful,I have had this CD for years and have given it away several times for gifts. It is one of my all-time favorites and is ultimately relaxing without being a yawn generator!
2,nauseating camera work,"This would have been a good action thriller except for the unsteady nauseating camera work, along the whole length of the movie,it spoiled it, you eventualy get sore eyes and feel sick, I am not sure what was the intention , it opened in Australia today,and that was a common complaint."
3,The Action Kingdom,"The Kingdom is introduced with a concise history of the modern rise of Saudi Arabia and other notable Middle Eastern events. I found this to be an informative start to the film.There is action a plenty on offer, but this is generally bulging with clichés and predictability.In terms of the narrative it is often far-fetched, yet it is still reasonably entertaining and provides plenty of shootout excitement.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
4,If you enjoy playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,"The Kingdom is an action-packed, politically driven thriller that takes place in the Middle East which follows a CIA response team responding to a terrorist shooting in the United Arab Emirates. The missions they take and the events that follow can't help but be compared to that of the single-player campaign in the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare games. If you enjoy action movies and can fully understand the political agenda of the film, you may take something from it."
4,Great movie,I think this movie is another great movie staring Jamie Foxx. It took a while for it to start but eventually you'll figure out where the movie is going. I recomend at least watching it once.5 stars for the acting4 stars for the overall movie.
5,Really good,"I just rented the Unbox version. I had read some good reviews here, but as the movie unfolded I was relieved that it was as good as people had said. This really was a non-political movie.So, if you like a shoot'em up FBI investigate with a who can you trust angle and whatnot subplot, you'll enjoy this movie. I recommend. I only noticed one spot where the video was choppy for just an instant. Otherwise, unbox played without incident."
1,DVD Skips,This DVD stops and jumps at least 3 times in the playing. I am very disappointed as I really enjoyed this movie and wanted to see it again at my convenience. The disc is flawed however and I am not getting what I wanted out of it.
