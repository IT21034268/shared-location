3,I expected more...,"3 stars because 1) you can't control the flash light: the camera always decide when to use it, even if you ask for 2) this camera doesn't show you how much battery charge remains: suddenly it's gone 3) That ""shaking"" sign appears even in ISO 400 or automatic mode(??????????). I'm used a manual camera FM2 NIKON and I know it is very different but I still think that this digital camera has a poor software and it is very simple for $300."
5,The most reliable camera I ever owned,"I purchased this camera for my wife 2 years ago, and it has been in very heavy use since. It is always in her purse, has been with us on many trips and has always performed flawlessly. Battery life is adaquate, the camera itself is small enough to be carried with you anywhere without becoming a burden, and it is amazingly sturdy.When I needed to get a camera as a present for a freind recently, I was delighted that this model is still on the market - and very attractively priced. I think that the cost / performace factor of this camera is the best in the market at this time (Jan. 2007)."
5,Right for my needs.,"I've reluctantly joined the digital world for still shots, but I'm thoroughly pleased with my purchase. I've just begun to explore its possibilities, but so far it seems user friendly. The price, convenience and service have been excellent."
1,dead in 9 months,"camera was great for nine months. Turned it on one day, lens telescoped out, LCD powered up, and camera died... just sent it in to Canon Service. But really, if this would have happened three months later I'm out the original prive of the camera ($400.00$ in Jan 2006 best buy). I've seen a lot of these phantom Canon deaths to this model."
3,Fragile,"I've broken the screen on this camera twice and I'm not going to bother to fix it again. When it's working it's fantastic for a point-and-shoot, just make sure you encase this in steel if you decide to buy it."
1,Lens will not close,"I loved this camera when I got it.But after three months the lens would not close. It makes grinding noises,the canon logo pops up on the screen then shuts off again.I am very disappointed in this camera."
1,a lemon,"My 550 lasted 12 weeks and then froze up completely. There was no trauma whatsoever. After 5 weeks I found out that it cannot be repaired. The red eye with indoor flash makes the photos useless unless you want to use software to correct each photo. I bought this camera because of the good reviews on Amazon but after researching online, I find that many have had similar problems. While it was working, the outdoor photos were very good."
1,beware e18,I've had this camera for 14 months - 2 months past the warranty. Got a sudden E18 error and it's dead now. Google e18 canon error and you'll see I'm not alone - this product can't be trusted - keep shopping!
5,perfect!,"this arrived in great shape from the seller and was an excellent buy. Just as described, this plush toy has a wire frame to it so while its plush, it stands upright. I'm sure this feature will be of great interest to our little one once he's able to stand up as he can interact with this plush animal on a different level. Looks perfect in his safari themed nursery. would purchase again."
4,elephant is great,"super addition to baby's room. size as expected, but very durable. not cuddly at all. Will surely be around as she grows up"
1,Not happy,"We got this before Christmas and it'&#65363; broken by the end of Dec.My 3 and 5 years old love to sit on it, but it can not stand up now.Also, it did smell dusty.I am planning to get one from Japan&#12290;[...]"
5,Sturdy and fun!,This is really a nice stuffed toy. The quality is good and it is very sturdy. The grandkids love it and I don't mind looking at it myself.
4,Very nice African elephant,I ordered two of these elephants as gifts for little girls - who were interested in elephants. If details are important - these are AFrican elephants with large ears - - an Indian elephant has the smaller ears.They look good in person - better than the photo.I would definitely purchase them again and would recommend them.
5,Super toy for kids,Stands upright! Not many plush toys do. My niece absolutely loves it. The material is soft to touch. A must buy for a 2 year old.
4,Great Shoes but narrow fit,they are great shoes and look nice makes your foot look smaller but they are quite snug and narrow dont know if they will stretch or if i should order a wider width...?
3,didn't fit my foot,i bought these before seeing danner's comment on their web site that these boots are better for a narrow foot.i never thought i had a wide foot before but i purchased these in my normal size and they were tight on the edges and long in the toe.instead of re-ordering in a wide size i returned them and got one of danner's other lasts for a more typical sized foot.
1,Never received this item,"Seller told me they didn't have this as advertised, transaction was cancelled."
3,bootleg quality funktory,"The CD arrived in just a few days! I am very happy with the delivery. About the album, it has a lot of covers with different names. Quality not so great. Peaks out on some speakers and sounds distorted in a bad way. Otherwise, another piece of funk soul history and I am glad it is Texas funk but I know there is more of it and better tracks out there. Just got to dig real deep I guess, (or maybe not SO deep...)."
5,Great collection,"Great collection of songs. Raw, earthy funk and soul. Great historical info in the booklet too!"
1,"Alicia Keys, India Arie, Jill Scott & (bonus) Janet Jackson (music videos on dvd)","I received this dvd BUT there are some MAJOR COMPLAINTS. while viewing this dvd it CONSTANTLY jumps &/or has black lines that run thruout dvd, i was happy to get Janet Jackson included but what good is a dvd that cannot be watched properly. so this seller gets a 2 (fair) for distributing faulty merchandise. To Seller:> ALWAYS preview disk before shipping to customers."
5,Awesome!,"This was the first Skynyrd album I bought, and it's the one that spends the most time in my stereo. This one has some of the greatest songs of all time: Free Bird, SHA, Simple Man, Four Walls of Raiford, and The ballad of Curtis Loew. The songs sound great, and there is such a variation. Lynyrd Skynyrd is GOD!"
5,The Best CD in Rock and Roll,This is my favorite cd of all time. I have a collection of over 300 cd's and this one is always my first choice to listen to. The 70's southern rock style is really easy to listen to and this band will never die.
4,"A fine collection, but...","This is probably the best collection of Skynyrd material out there, replacing the older ""Gold and Platinum"" album. However, do we really need TWO versions of ""Freebird,"" one studio, one live? That endless guitar solo sounds pretty much the same either way. They could have given us only one version, and then had space for a few other gems, notably ""Needle and the Spoon"" which, for some odd reason, is not included. ""Down South Jukin"" would be a nice addition, too. ""Don't Ask Me No Questions"" would also have been appropriate to include, had not the double versions of ""Freebird"" wasted so much space!There are a few raities here that will be of interests to those who have all of the band's standard material. Overall, a fine collection from a great American band."
5,Greatest Southern rock band of all time,"Lynyrd Skynyrd helped make southern rock what it is today. The all time greatest hits did not have simple man of workin for MCA. Those are really good songs. Sweet home Alabama is a pure classic. You might here it on the radio all the time but it still great to listen to. Free bird was a great long song for Lynyrd Skynyrd. It is pure art of music. I close my eyes when I listen to Simple Man. That song is very inspiring and true to man. Gimme three steps, call me the breeze, workin for Mca, and what's your name are jamming songs that make you feel good inside and joyful. Comin home is a song that you do not hear on the radio. It's so cool. There are just so many songs on here that really rock. A good price for 25 songs. I don't think Lynyrd Skynyrd was great enough to get his box set though but they are my favorite southern rock band. God bless you and have a great day."
2,Questionable Quality,The recordings could have been cleaned up better. Not the quality I expected. Great collection of songs just too bad they didnt clean up the hiss and scratchiness.
5,A Perfect Primer On Lynyrd Skynyrd,"THE ESSENTIAL LYNYRD SKYNYRD trumps GOLD AND PLATINUM as the first place to go for Lynyrd Skynyrd by including five cuts each from SECOND HELPING and STREET SURVIVORS. If you don't want to splurge for all of the individual albums, or for the boxed set, get this one."
1,Freebird Sucks!!,"Lynyrd Skynyrd are just an awful joke. Free Bird has to be one of the lousiest most worst songs ever recorded. Even Heavy Fuel by Dire Straits is much better than that....This compilation anyway is lousy, stupid, overrated, and lame just like The Beatles 1. Avoid all the lousy bands and get my bands insted.Thanks."
1,Enough already.,Save yourself some money. Just move to Pittsburgh and listen to any rock station here. You will most likely hear every song listed within a couple days time. I know I have.
4,The Essential Lynyrd Skynyrd,"This is a pritty solid cd. My favorite tracks include: Tuesday's Gone, Gimme Back My Bullets, All I Can Do Is Write About It, That Smell, Sweet Home Alabama, Simple Man, The Ballad of Curtis Lowe, and Free Bird. Pick this cd up if you like Lynyrd Skynyrd."
3,"OK, but a little too weak","I purchased two of these and while they are OK and do a good job replacing the stupid spouts that come on new gas cans these days, I snapped one off at the base -- the plastic isn't quite strong enough for normal use. If you're careful, they might last awhile.I sure do miss the flexible spouts that came with gas cans many years ago!"
3,gaskets,Where can one get replacement gaskets? If you tighten it too much the gaskets crush and then leak!
3,Needs improvement,I will start with what I like about this product.1. The flexibility2. You can see the gas going through the tube.3. The cap at the end of the hose is attached to the hose making it harder to lose.4. The shut off function.5. Three sizes of screw on caps to fit various sizes of cans.6. Excellent customer service.What I do not like.1. Every one I have owned has eventually leaked.2. Some but not all have missing gaskets.3. Tighten any of the caps too much and the gasket will permanetly deform or the cap will break.I like the concept of this product but the company needs to take care of the quality control issues. I would have rated this product lower but when I called the company they were very friendly and sent me several replacements. In fact they sent me far more replacements than I requested. When I'm sure the quality issues are resolved I'll be the first in line to purchase more.
2,My 3 quart All Clad Stainless Saute Pan has warped.,"I used the pan several years on a gas stove. I never left the pan empty on the flame, used high heat, nor did I submerge a hot pan in water after using it. After I moved into a new home in Spain where I have to use ceramic stove I noticed the pan was slightly but annoyingly damaged - warped. Using the pan on a gas burner does not show warping defects easily unlike glass/ceramic cook tops. I contacted All Clad and they of suggested that I had misused it. They asked me to mail it to All Clad for evaluation which I do not want to do since I now live in Europe. The cost of shipping to US is fairly high and paying possible customs charges if All Clad finds the pan was defective and wanted to ship a new one to me. Disappointed in All Clad customer service."
2,WARPED - A Couple of My All-Clad Pieces Warped,"I've had this pan for years and I use it maybe a couple of times a month. I probably have 12 pieces of all-clad and I don't cook everyday. Many of my pans, including this one, are beginning to WARP. After having researched this on the web (lots of people have this problem) and learning that even if I had registered them (warranty) they are too old. I was informed by the company that warping is a sign of misuse - hmmm, I used mine to cook with.So I now get to throw them away and replace them. I remember thinking when I first began to buy/collect them that they were a lifetime purchase/investment. Well now 10 years later I'm throwing them away. I think they should have lasted longer for the price ...I haven't decided whether to replace them with a more disposable brand (cheaper to throw away) or a higher end brand (last longer?). Either way I think you should know before you buy them that they may warp without explanation."
5,Beautiful description,"I really enjoyed this book and its description of orthodox Judaism. It has a description of every holiday in the year. The time period is also interesting, New York 1970s."
5,Beautiful tool!,This is the torque wrench I should have bought long ago! Haven't used it much yet because I have only had it for 1 week but it is obviously a well made tool. It's nice to know that I can now actually torque fasteners on my Harley Davidson to factory spec when performing service. Great price for a precision instrument too!
4,Nice,This is a nice torque wrench that is labeled both in ft*lbs and nM. The adjustments are easy to make. The only thing I will complain about is that the collar that you adjust the torque with is easy to in advertently hit when wrenching.
1,Short Sighted,"Most negroes in America are in fact mixed with white or other blood. How can a negro mixed with the blood of the slave holder have a claim against the slave holder ? Isnt that a claim against himself ?What is never considered is what the negro owes America for rescuing them from the Various Slavers in Africa and giving them the opportunity to earn their freedom, how many negroes in the USA are better off than their counterparts that stayed in Africa today and now live in mud huts ?"
5,Candle Burning Rituals,I am finding the book interesting. I can not wait to get started & see how well I do. I need help in my life more than ever right now & so since I am a beginner & a real believer in magic. I have believed since I was a teenager but just really never tried it but I am willing to learn & really get into it. Wish me luck.
3,Hmmmmm?,This book is not as bad as it looks. It's preety much basics for dummies so if thats what you need this is good.
3,Elijah P. Brown's biography of Billy Sunday,"Written during the prime of Sunday`s evangelistic career, covers Sunday`s childhood, baseball career and conversion, his rise to a prominent evangelist, and characteristics of a Sunday meeting. Includes the sermons ""The Three Groups,"" ""Under the Sun,"" and ""Wonderful,"" as well as a collection of quotes and a large collection of pictures."
5,Microsoft Money 2004 for Dummies by Peter Weverka,"I have been using Microsoft Money to manage my finances and portfolio since 1999. I thought I knew how to use it until I began reading this book. Mr. Weverka has shown me how little I really new about the capabilities and ease of use of this excellent program. It is written so that ordinary people such as myself can easily understand it, with touches of humor to lighten the tedium. Thank you, Peter Weverka!"
2,Blue Marshmallow,I thought these slippers were so cute that I ordered them in a size 6 A2. I was very disappointed when I tried them on to find them extremely wide. There is no way that these slippers will fit someone with a narrow foot. They felt like squishy marshmallows. I returned them for a refund.
2,Was very disappointed,"This product is a hassle to use and gives VERY inaccurate readings when the bottom is grassy. The default sensitivity was too high for where I fish so I turned it down per the instructions. A few minutes later, it would go back to the factory default setting though I had not touched it. It also showed very deep readings when I went over a grassy bottom. This is a software issue. The settings are not as easy to set as one might think due to the touchiness of the system. Again, another software issue.My concluding impressions are that the build is moderately solid but the software issues with the product make it difficult to use and enjoy."
4,Shows that rock is it in the 80s and 90s,Sammy saving the White House and all those who drive...thank you...you entertain and rock and we have needed you so though you should get more credit for the career and the songs you have made.
4,That was a very good album!,I would like a copy of Sammy Hagar's Voa CD! If The Manufactor starts making more of this album and title without ripping me off around a scary price tag of $150.99 to $500.00 Soon. I don't have the money or time to purchase this joker of a album because the item is too expensive!
1,Disappointing,"Having been a serious triathlete who has used heart rate monitors for the past 10 years, I was excited about the description of this product. When I opened the box, I was immediately disappointed in its appearance. It looks like an incredibly cheap watch that you would buy at a dime store. The watch itself looks like it would break apart with any jarring, and the watch band is nothing more than a ribbon that is adjusted by pulling it through a flimsy bracket attached to the watch. This causes the ""end"" of the band to stick out when the watch is on. I did not use it once, put it back in the box, and am sending it back. It may work just fine, but I'm not going to pay this kind of money for a heart rate monitor that looks like something you got out of a vending machine. Pathetic."
4,Ok,"The functions are great. The design needs some work. The buttons get inadvertently pushed all the time, and the cloth strap is awful."
4,One of her best books in years.,"An excellent book although written in the overly-familiar style of many of her other books. The difference this time is her wit. Her sarcastic descriptions of the obnoxious rich people in the book are hysterical. She is descriptive, critical and condemning all in the same sentence.I don't understand why writers inflict us with so many novels about the ""problems"" of rich people. Rich people are not all that interesting. But, in this case, Oates brings us an edge to the characters not often found in the ""I'm rich but I'm miserable"" genre of fiction.Many familiar themes appear from her huge body of work. She has a style that is unshakable and unchangable. She repeats herself and it's either good reading or terrible reading (e.g. We Were The Mulvaneys). In this case it's great reading."
2,Felt it went nowhere...,"Just finished reading it and felt I had wasted my time. I felt it kind of rambled back and forth, back and forth and went nowhere."
1,Pointless and boring,"I ordered this book because I was reading it for a book club I founded. One of the book club members had said that he was a big fan of this author and had read amazing stuff from her in the past. However, as we read through the book, at each meeting this same person said he was thoroughly disappointed by this book and felt that her talent had apparently run dry. While I haven't read anything else by Joyce Carol Oates, this book does not inspire me to explore her further. The characters were totally unreal, the story meandered from pointless episode to pointless episode, and it was quite the drag to finally complete."
5,one word TENANT,"I love the song TENANT the whole cd is great but that song I can never get tired of. Its got a spooky quietness about it and the guitar pluckings are the best part. You can't go wrong with this. Anyone even curious about this band needs to start with this. The first two albums were more straightforward punk with goth overones. This is were they matured that sound, a must have for post punk fans then get JUJU!!"
5,One of their best!,"This is one of Siouxsie's best albums. If you think Happy House is cool and gothic and artistic, you MUST listen to ""Red Light"" and ""Skin"". Incredible. They should have both been hits but the only reason they weren't is because they use some profane language, but it's some of their most honest and political lyrics."
5,Great Music,"The first song on this CD,""Happy House,"" is about an insane asylum -- not just any insane asylum but the insane asylum we all live in called civilization where, with the blind pretence that all's well, people choose not to see what they don't want to (""with our blinkers on""), forcing individuals to see things their way, to conform to their insane norms (""there's room for you if you say 'I do'/but don't say no or you'll have to go""). This album -- this band's career, in fact -- is about the other side of life, about seeing what others don't want to see and rising above it instead of going through life pretending that things such as death don't exist."
4,This album and Juju are pretty tied,"Hybrid and um... Tenant are good songs. Desert Kisses is great. The electronic song is good too, forgot what it's called ""chasing a monsoon..."". The one where's she's wailing ooooh over and over is good too. I should have looked at the title list before commenting :p""Take it to the wall"""
4,The first Banshee's album?,"The aptly titled Kaleidoscope is an album with several moods and equally as many guitarists. It's my understanding that this album was made after their first guitarist and drummer left the Banshees. At the time many wondered what would become of Siouxsie and the Banshee but Severin and Sioux released an amazing album! From ""Happy House"" to ""Clockface"" to ""Skin"" and ""Lunar Camel"" the album never keeps it's center and that is it's appeal."
3,Not fabulous,"This embosser is okay. Communication with the seller was suboptimal and resulted in an imperfect embossing plate, although the seller was quick to rectify. You have to push the lever really hard to create an adequate embossing, which works well on thin envelopes and not well on thicker, nicer stationery. I'm overall pretty disappointed, especially considering the $40+ price for this embosser. The device itself is sturdy, nice-looking, and well-made, but I have not been impressed with the embossing itself. I'd probably prefer a inked stamp at this point!"
4,Great Embosser - A Little Hard to Use Though!,"I I had received an Amazon gift card for my birthday and spent a lot of time thinking about what I woud like to purchase for myself as a birthday gift! I decided I wanted an embosser since I own so many books and really love reading! I perused all of the ones available on Amazon and read the reviews as I wanted to be certain I purchased the right one for me. I will say the customer service was excellent and they were so prompt in their e-mail responses, I was very impressed. I do love the design and they were more than willing to work with me on customizing my stamp plate at no extra charge, which I thought was wonderful. The product arrived and it is really quite beautiful! My only complaint is that it is somewhat difficult to use and I am not sure that is a design flaw but the nature of trying to stamp a book! Overall, I would recommend this purchase. It is gorgeous and the embossing is very very cool!"
4,Excellent quality--will take practice!,"I gave this to my husband as a gift, and he loved it! It's very heavy and nice quality. However, we can't seem to get the knack of embossing with just the right amount of pressure: the impression is either too light or goes all the way through the paper."
5,Very Nice item and superior service,I read and compared several of these items before deciding on this particular version and am exceedingly glad I did. When the embosser was delivered (a gift for my wife) I realized that i had left something off of the embossing emblem. Immediately contacted the company and a new corrected one was on it's way the next day. Great service and a great product!
5,One of the best Fantasy Fiction,"Fantasy is my favourite genre. It's compelling, it's mystical, and it's very exciting, having every point of perspective, and every original idea.This is one of the best books to read if you want to get lost in the world of fantasy. I almost cried when the book was over, because it was so brilliant. Yes, it was a bit draggy, and the ending wasn't explained too properly, but the plots, the ideas, the exquisite description of every single detail makes up for all that. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who loves fantasy. It almost made me beleive in faeries!"
2,1807D Master Locks,"Ordered 2 six packs (as advertised) and received individual locks with individual keys, not what was advertised. I will keep the items."
2,Worked great while it lasted,I bought this player about 15 months ago and I was very happy with the picture quality and features. But for the price I would have expected it to last longer than the $99 throw away units.I have other video components over 5 years old and still going strong.Wish I could find an HDMI player that works well and lasts too!
4,I hope I'm smart enough to use it!,"This player has more bells and whistles than my desktop PC. If you want to customize your playback, this is the unit for you. I have mine hooked to the HDMI and haven't tried any other connection for comparison. Sleek unit, remote is OK. Only 3-4 movies played as of now, so I'm still dialing it in. I think all will work just fine in the end."
2,sweet but short,Great dvd player for up converting to HD right up to the day it died 4 months later.
2,Asian screen,The screen was marred on the gold side. The screws on the side pieces were pulled out of the main piece.
5,All-Clad True,"It's no secret that I love All-Clad. The 8-inch is perfect when cooking for one or two. The pan has great release. I always hand wash and about once a month, I polish the stainless steel with Bar Keeper's friend to keep it looking like new.I also have the nonstick 10 inch and I am trying to send it back to All-Clad for warranty evaluation. I did not know that you shouldn't use nonstick spay with nonstick cookware and that the heat should be relatively low. I never use more than medium heat with any of my All-Clad and yet my pan lost its nonstick properties.When a plan losses its nonstick properties, All-Clad suggests cleaning with a paste of baking soda and water. If the baking soda doesn't turn brown, switch to Bar Keeper's Friend and water. Always scrub with something made for nonstick cookeware. None of this helped my pan, so I will send it in to All-Clad."
2,not as claimed,"These snowshoes, the manufacturer claims, will support up to 275 lbs. BS! I tried them in snow near Grand Canyon, and I sank nearly to my knees! what are the conditions required to meet their claims? I weigh 200 lbs. + 15-20 more for gear. What am I missing? That is, besides the money I paid for these worthless closet denizens."
3,way to small,"I work with my hands so i was looking for a decent scrubber to get out greases and dirt. this looked like a good deal, 6 for a good price. When they arrived a couldn't believe how small they where.Not made for guys who get dirty more for kids. You get what you pay for."
3,nail scrub brush somewhat satisfactory,"This brush isn't as large as I would like. The bristles are the right firmness, but really could use another row added to the brush. Considering I use a scrub brush often after gardening and couldn't find any in any town near me, I'm glad I at least have these until I can locate a better brush. When I do, I'll get several. I didn't know these would be so hard to come by when Wal-Mart quiet carrying them."
1,Too Small,I was looking for a good nail brush. These are definately not what I was looking for. They are very small and don't work well at all. Pass on this!
5,"Seriously, best saute pan ever!","As promised, the entire bottom heats evenly and even the sides of the pan are sufficiently heated to expand the cooking surface!It is worth the money. I will probably use this pan more than any other for cooking large meals."
4,Very good Saute Pan,I am taking a culinary arts class here at school and found this saute pan very easy to use and clean. I used it everytime to cook meat and the meat came out delicious.
5,My Favorite pan in the world,"This pan cooks evenly even though it is bigger than most heating surface. The size is perfect for large meals for families or for any dish that calls for leafy vegetables that start off HUGE and shrink down with heat (broccoli Rabe, escarole and beans, lentils and spinach etc.).Downside: Its heavy, use two hands.I have two of these pans. If I lost one somehow, I would by another."
2,A disappointment,"My book club read Haien's THE ALL OF IT and loved it. I was looking forward to another excellent book, but I was very disappointed. I didn't connect with any of the characters and I especially didn't care for the wartime descriptions; they didn't seem realistic. The twins were not characterized well; I didn't feel I knew them. Too much time passed, too quickly for any real feelings to develop. I have to admit I just skimmed the last half of the book to see what the big mystery re: the twins was. And that was anticlimatic. I liked the first novel so much better. It hardly seems to be the same author."
2,Matters of Chance would make a good tv movie of the week.,"This book had an excellent beginning, filled with promise but quickly devolved into predictability. Most affecting section was the main character's wartime experiences. There was some expectation that, once home, some dramatic conflict would start, since he was changed by his wartime exploits. Instead, we are subjected to a relentless onslought of perfect people who always do the right, noble thing. Bits of historic arcana are sprinkled in for some odd reason -- perhaps to remind us that there is a real world out there. Subjects such as homosexuality, adoption, adultery are all reacted to with grace and equanimity. Isn't pretty to think so. I don't have a problem with noble and uplifting characters -- but there has to some bad guys, if for no other reason than texture!"
4,Not Bad !,"I never new this t.v. series existed. This episode was very well done and if you're a Scott Glenn fan you'll like the loosened up, more animated Glenn in this. Beware there is a full frontal nude scene...doesn't last too long. Even though there are a couple of important clues in this scene we could have done without the x rated bits.Lots of good acting, very lively with some nice bits of humor. It's not expensive second hand. I say go ahead and buy it. You'll like it."
5,"An epic, two-fisted adventure!","A major improvement on the first book in the series, Dan Parkinson brings us a grand tale of time travelling Nazis versus the heroic TEC. Loads of fun, this tale reads like a pulp adventure in the classic style, with plenty of time-jumping and event manipulation thrown in. Parkinson explains some of the stuff he threw in to the first book, which allows this tale to make a lot more sense. The pace of the book is frenetic from beginning to end, with some genuinely nail-biting moments. If you liked the series, or are just after some thrilling entertainment, pick this book up."
3,Its a bit too sugary but its ok,I think Honey Buns are too sugary because it made me sick when iate this.my suggestion is eating a healthy apple or a fruit.I dont recommend Honey Buns for a snack.So please use your money and buy something healthier.
5,This is a great album,Can't stop listening to this CD. I almost know her songs by heart. I'm really looking forward to her next album.
5,A taste for good music,I only recently listened to Maarja and I found her music to be unique and original. She has a great voice and her songs are quite catchy.Easy listening for all ages.
1,Not Ready For Primetime,I have been involved with Fighter Ace since its beginning years ago. I can say with all honesty that this is the buggiest version ever made. You are buying a beta game with substandard servers and support. Think twice before you get roped into this. Not ready for primetime!
1,Dissapointing Game/ Customer Service,"Even though the graphics are fair, the most annoying part of this game is server stability. I could not stay connected for more than few minutes at a time(and I'm on a T1 connection). When I did eventually find a sysop to help me, he tried to tell me that the connection problems were all my fault. After I had explained that I never have have any problems with any other games, he became defensive and rude. And this guy represents this company??? I won't reccomend this game to anybody."
2,dislpease,i was a fighter ace user butt when they changed i could not find it. i would to fly it again.I also was paying and they changed . I thought they were ok . I guess thats not true.
2,Read The Fine Print!,"You may want ot check of the games online newsgroup to really get a feel for this game. Pay close attention to the minimum system requirements and then double them if you want good playability. Dial Up users will find themselves at a disadvantage, you really need something more to get the best of it. Look for the @FA's for help. Be aware you are buying a work in progress not a final edition. Great graphics and lots of options but make sure you are equipped for it. Happy flying."
1,Save your cash,"This game was given to me as a gift by a friend. I can honestly say that this game has a long way to go before I would recomend it to anybody. The game came with no instructions and or documentation. There is an online file you can read but I would have to say that it way too vague. Graphics are ok, but not as good as IL-2. The worst problem was with the game play. The servers are horrible including lag and random dropouts and disconnects. There is a help room, but after waiting for half an hour trying to some help I left. I also have to caution parents with young children (as I) about the language used in some of the arenas. Even with system operators monitoring the room, this still continued. Too bad, because it looks like this game could be fun."
1,Game in not ready for the public!,"Even though FA3.5 has possibilities, I can honestly say that in it's current state it has too many bugs to be enjoyable. It seems that Jaleco rushed this product out too quickly. The game has been out for several months and still there has been no patches to fix any of the current problems. The constant scoring issues as well as the ineffectiveness of any of the game designers to keep the players apprised of any progress has driven many long time players and squads to other online games. I hope Jaleco can resolve the game issues soon.Rilak"
5,I Spy Junior,"My son is a few months shy of three, and his loves I Spy Junior. There are enough different games to play to keep him interested for an extended length of time (up to 30 minutes), and he wants to play it again the next day. He has not tired of it yet and we have had it for 2 months (a long time at this age). It has improved his concentration, eye-hand coordination, color and number recognition and how to follow directions. It keeps an adult's interest, too."
4,Perfect for Preschoolers!,"My 3 year old loves this software package! It has 6 different activities that really help with important learning skills for his age group. I Spy has helped with learning to recognize and put together patterns, following directions, and independent thinking...and it's fun! The software uses familiar looking objects, such as colorful toys and beads. Other software packages have left us feeling that there should be more, but we really enjoy I Spy!"
4,Does not Work on Windows XP,This game would not run on Windows XP out of the box. Scholastic support did not have a solution but I found it would run in compatibility mode.My son loves the games and puzzles. This was a truly great learning game for kids.
1,Not MAc OS X,This does not work on a newer Mac. It took customer service over 2 weeks to get back to me. Received as a gift. Hopefully Amazon will take it back.
4,"It's a great item, however....","I got this laminator to laminate the hand-crocheted bookmarks that I make in order to keep them from getting torn or dirty. It's a great little machine, however the instructions leave a lot to be desired. They are very basic. The two whole pages are just the simple how-tos and lack a lot of information. This setup is perfect for someone who has owned a laminator before.Now, for the things that came with the machine... There is a good sized package of laminating pouches, the laminator itself is a beautiful machine and very easy to operate.The only complaint that I have is the lack of instructions and I can't wait to laminate!"
5,Cosmic Laminator,"Product works as expected. It is easy to use. It really churns out great laminated pages. Be sure to plug in the machine and turn it on first. The get everything ready while the machine heats up. It is best to do a mass laminating session because it take a good five minutes for the machine to heat up. This is great for the individual user. If you are looking for business use, go for a huger end product."
5,This is a great laminator,"My only beef with this is the instructions are not clear at all, and they really don't give you information on how to use it.I have only tried the hot lamination, as they didn't include pouches for the cold laminator. But the hot works great. Tried it on several items, and was very happy with all of them (all were paper).Great item, highly recommend!"
2,Great features but kept locking up!,"When I did my anaylsis for features vs. cost the audiovox came out very high on my list. It was very simple to use, it came with the maps preloaded on an SD card, it had an excellent mounting bracket, multiple views and many POI. I knew I was in trouble when I first went to use it I had it hit the reset button. Once I did that it worked great for the day, but the next morning it was locked up again and I had to reset it. With each reset I lost my waypoints. It did everything it advertised, but it just kept locking up (it is a windows based product so I should of expected it). After about 4 or 5 more attempts I boxed it up and shipped it back. Very disappointing."
1,Buyer Beware,"The NVX226 has a known software problem that requires the buyer to return the unit upon purchase. It doesn't recognize the state of Louisiana. They only have one technician that is able to work on the units. It took 3 weeks for my unit to be returned to me. Upon receiving it, I discovered another software problem and was told to return it a second time. Audiovox doesn't do refunds. I would not recommend this unit to anyone."
1,Junk,"If you paid more then $10 for this, you were ripped off like I was. Software issues galore. Special turn off sequence required, and it tells you to make illegal turns. Customer support does not exist."
1,Did he really research this book?,"On Page 239, the part about Hamburger Hill, the author says the Marines were fired upon from heavily dug in NVA. This was an 101st Airborne Battle, not the Marine Corps. The 3rd Brigade,and units of the 2nd Brigade of the 101st fought in this battle. I hope the rest of this book isn't as poorly researched as Page 239. I was a member of D/2/501 Inf, 101st Airborne Div., so I know about what I speak."
4,"Pretty Good, Pretty Unbiased, Eye Opening...","I liked this book because it is easy to read and it really puts the history regarding this war into prospective. This book basically covers from the last bit of Japanese occupation to the normalization of US relations with Vietnam in the 1990s.I think this book should talked more about the air war over North Vietnam during operations Rolling Thunder and Linebacker I/II. I know that most of the fighting, when not being thought up in the White House, was being done in the South Vietnamese interior, but the bombing of North Vietnam, the way targets were selected and by whom, and the effects it had should have gone much further into detail."
2,Bad History,"Overall the book is terrible. As Guernsey noted, the author follows the incorrect conventional view on the war. The war was a mistake, we overacted, the North Vietnamese were really the good guys, blah blah blah blah.The only redeeming quality is the little exerpts the can be found on almost every page. These blurbs (which go by various titles) contain some very interesting facts on the war. This book may be useful for an experienced scholar on the war. However, the overall bias makes the book useless for its target audience."
4,Good Overview,"In a topic filled with insanity, exaggeration and political debunking, this book provides a sober, well-researched overview of the benefits of hemp. It keeps its subject tightly focused within 160 pages, providing factual arguments for hemp's use as a source of textiles, building materials, food (lots of protein, vitamins and minerals), paper and fuel. It also seems to suggest support for legalizing its sibling, which the ignoramuses of the world mistake for hemp. (I, too, advocate legalizing marijuana.) Otherwise, why would the author include a chapter on growing your own indoors, as well as a list of web sites that overtly cater to the marijuana sub-(counter)-culture. Thankfully, the author handles this topic in a calm, sane manner by weaving it nicely into the main thesis of the book."
1,What a piece of crap,"This wasn't just the worst book on hemp possible, it may be the worst book ever written. Facile, superficial, poorly researched, riddled with errors and typographical errors, I actually took it back to Chapters and made them return my money. If they hadn't, I would have burned it in the back yard and then scrubbed my hands with Janitor in a Drum out of fear that residual traces would infect my family. So much could have been done; so little is evident in this effort. I can't even call it a book. It demeans the word."
5,"Absolutely great, but first choice?","Gilels is one of my favorite Beethoven interpreters, and this box proves again what a great pianist he was.However, I do have a bit of a problem with the recording quality. These are all live performances, and there is a lot of audience noise, sometimes just too much...But well, can't deduct a star for that when his playing is that magnificent! You can always listen to some audio samples and make up your mind.You might want to consider buying theDeutsche Grammophon box setinstead, which has a great sound quality and is usually quite affordable (try Amazon marketplace). But if you have problems choosing, then just buy both!"
2,"A bargain, but not what we expected","These earrings are very tiny, nothing what you would think from the picture, and I guess you get what you pay for. I bought them for my daughter who thought she was going to use them in her tragus piercing, but they are way too small so she just uses them in her upper cartlidge piercing instead."
5,CHER !!!,"I LOVE CHER !!! and i cant wait for this DVD to hit the shelves cuz i want/need it for my CHER collection. but they are missing a lot of videos, ""All or Nothing"" is not there and some of her other videos ""the musics no good without you"", ""alive again."" but i am hoping i see them in the near future. although some videos arent there, i still love CHER and there are gonna be a lot of DVD collections cuz this woman is unstoppable and its gonna take more then 1 DVD to fill all of Cher's music videos. who knows maybe she will come out with a remix album !!! (follow that you bitches!!)GO CHER !!!!"
2,So much missing...,"The videos that are here ARE GOOD, albeit some of them not the versions that are advertised, but whatever. Where are LOVE & UNDERSTANDING ( a top 20 hit), HELL ON WHEELS, THE MUSIC'S NO GOOD WITHOUT YOU (some may say it wasn't released in the USA so why include it? Well, LOVE CAN BUILD A BRIDGE is here and has NEVER even been released on cd in the USA), WE ALL SLEEP ALONE (the version w/ band shots intercut-the one included is like a home movie of her and Rob Camilletti circa 1988), TAKE ME HOME, DARK LADY (cartoon, but one of the first memories I have of Cher) & ALL OR NOTHING."
2,Disappointing after such a long wait...,"I am a huge Cher-a-holic, but I have to share others' disappointment that so many of her videos were left on the shelf (the little-seen Hell on Wheels, one of the first-ever music videos, All or Nothing, Dark Lady, and the stunning duet with Eros, Pue Che Poi, among others). I can only imagine that Warners is looking to milk us all for more dollars by holding back and then releasing another video compilation when Cher gets off her tour sometime in 2008 and records another album. The inclusion of the dreadful slow version of One by One is at least counter-balanced by the fact that the original version of Song for the Lonely, not the awful Almight Mix, is included. (Whoever was in charge of labeling the tracks was asleep.) But in sum, a neverending stream of Rob Camilletti appearances (4 videos!) makes for tough going after a while. Better luck next time."
4,"At Last, Cher's Best Videos on DVD !","For the first time ever, Cher videos are going to be released on DVD ! The only reason i'm giving it 4 stars is beacuse it doesn't include all of her videos (Love & Understanding, Music's No Good Without You, All Or Nothing, Alive Again, etc.)A Must For All of Her Fans !"
4,will somebody get the video track list right??!,"I am so happy to see a video compilation of SOME of Cher's videos. It is a long time in coming. I work in the factory that makes the DVD so I have been ""quality checking"" it for a couple weeks now...it has been the soundtrack to my 12-hour days, quite frankly. I just wish that all the online shopping websites could get the track listing right! For the record, ""Dark Lady"" and the ""Almighy mix of Believe"", and the ""dance version of One By One"" are NOT included on it. But, ""Half-Breed"" is and the european album version of ""One By One"" is. Along with the europe-only charity single video for ""Love Can Build A Bridge"", a song Cher sang with Neneh Cherry and Chrissie Hynde. So, if this had been a ""Complete"" video collection, I would have given it 10 stars if I could! But, as it stands, it is extremely enjoyable, if not perfect, and a MUST for any Cherfan. P.S. Cher looks so great in the ""Walking In Memphis"" video!!"
2,SHAME!!!,wheres LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING AND DARK LADYthe remixes arent remixed versions. I have seen the remixes FOULLLL!!!!!!!!!!! after waiting for so many years
1,owful experencie,I NEVER RECEIVED THIS DVD I RECEIVED A VERY BAD CD WITH SCRATCHERS AND I SENT TWO EMAILS TO THE SELLER AND HE NEVER ANSWER ME.I CAN'T SAY NOTHING ABAUT THIS PRODUCT
4,another hit for cher.,"this dvd is great. i have seen most of the filmclips on here and they are great, definatly dvd worthy material. It is lacking classics like""alive again"" ""the music's no good without you"" and "" i got you babe"" but still well worth the money."
3,Great - but disappointing,"While this DVD contains a few of Cher's classic videos (and some not so classic), the track listing on the cover doesn't match the contents. ""One by One"" and ""A Song for the Lonely"" are NOT the remix videos as listed...which is a shame because they are both great examples of her recent dance music career."
5,Quite a good sequel!,"This is an excellent, matured addition to the path of the Artist's Way. I'm using it extensively and have started a Yahoo group for people who are on this path. Come join us ...It really is a nice book, and is available for a good price , even though it's still hardcover! Grab it and get started, you won't regret it. Even if you haven't done The Artis't Way yet, you can start this one.-d"
4,Great book,"I have only looked through this book, as I haven't had time to really sit down and take it in. I have heard so much good about this particular book that I have been saving it for when I have plenty of time to take it in. Shipped quickly and book in like-new condition when I received it!!"
2,Disappointed!,"I bought the ""Walking in the World"" CD and was very disappointed that Julia Cameron is not the narrator. I own an ""Artist's Way"" tape and have grown to love to listen to Julia's own soothing voice. The narrator of the ""Walking"" CD reads it like she is reading a storybook to a kindergarten class. It is very annoying."
4,A good continuation to but not as good as the Artists Way,"This is a nice continuation of the Artists Way program, but will not be as effective without having done the Artists Way first. There are a lot more references to ""God"" and ""The Creator"" than the first book, and a bit of repeated information in an identical format. That said, I think this book is a perfect continuation for both artistic recovery and artistic expansion, and is very useful."
5,Highlights from a Life,"This CD is highlights of the play based on Holly's autobiography. As such, it's really a best of Holly Near CD, which is great since little of her previous music is available. Holly Near has been a feminist folk singer for more than 20 years. She has a wonderful, clear voice with a wide range and is accompanied by piano. Her songs range from singing about growing up in California (Water Come Down) to realizing that she's a lesbian (Imagine My Surprise). Few are ""in your face"" songs - most are simply beautiful. Think of this as Judy Collins as a lesbian."
3,Don't pay 99 bucks,I bought this new from Bestbuy for 99 bucks like 5 years ago and have seen them on ebay for as cheap as 10. Good solid sub but don't pay over 50.
2,non energystar compliant,for less money and better sound i was able to get a subwoofer that shuts itself off after 11 mins of no music input. i read the instructions and dont see anything about auto shutoff... soapparently this just runs 24/7 while im at work or leave for the weekend to my other house which HAS auto shutoff subwoofers..has sony ever heard of energystar?? otherwise it works well but for less money you can find one w/auto shutoff.i use it in the bedroom and it provides adequate base..
3,Shark complex,I love this product very much because it has so much great natural stuff in it plus it has 8 hours time release! It looked like an ideal supplement until I found out they included shark (oil and cartilage) in it. I live by the ocean so I know how important it is that sharks stay alive. I wish they would make a vegetarian version.
1,Do Not buy this book if you have v6 3.8 engine,"I own a 2003 chevy impala v6 3.8 Ls and I found there isn't much information about this engine type. I was trying, for example, to add power steering fluid for my car and could not find it. I looked up in this book and saddly couldn't find any information from it. Another case was trying to find wheel bearing information and couldn't find any in this book either. You'll be disappointed if you think you can find all information for your car in this book."
2,Not That Great,"You would think that because it is the music of Ben Gibbard that it would be great, but this CD isnt. Without the pulse of the drums its dull most of the time. The violins are too liberal with the lyrical line at times. Often times you cant even tell what lyrics they are trying to play. When listening to the CD it either sounds like you are at a wedding, kinda like the movie ""the wedding singer"" when Sandler gets stood up, or it sounds like you are at a chinese restruant. Some of the songs are ok though. However, they do no justice to ""transatlanticism."" It sounds like the titanic song. I would only recommend this CD to Die Hard Death Cab For Cutie Fans. It may make good study music, though if you like DCFC it may frustrate you to the point where you can't study."
3,Delicious product; very high shipping cost,"I concur with other reviewers in that this is a very good product, quick shipping and quality service, but the shipping cost was very high."
3,Used as a gift for a friend,Product arrived quickly and I used as gift to a friend. Still looking for Ghost pepper sauce at retail so may have to order on line. My favorite still is Tabasco as it is milder more to my taste and the assorted products but some like it hot or hotter or burn your taste buds out.
5,Good writing and great concepts converge in this book,"Simple to understand, easy to read, always interesting, and most amazingly, often entertaining. This is high praise for a ""technical book."" It is actually not a technical book, but it is about technical subjects, several relatively complex market concepts, and the big trends in networking. All easy to follow and recall after reading. I like Mr. Shepard's organization and style. It seemed to me that I was often hearing him speak these thoughts, rather than just reading them. I highly recommend this book to Service Providers, Network Equipment manufacturers, and to the component companies that are designing the chips for future networks. This book will jump-start your understanding of how convergence is influencing system and service designs for our future networked world. Enjoy the book, I did."
3,"Good stuff, but really poorly edited","This book provided a good overview of telecom technology, but you have to work though lots of poor editing. For example, it reads ""DWDM (discussed earlier) is a..."". Unfortunately, DWDM has not been discussed earlier (as confirmed by the index in the back) and is not explained after that. DWDM is a pretty important topic and I'm sure they did plan to have it explained in some detail. The editor just seems to have left it out. It also has typos like saying ""Technology A is superior to tech B, so tech B has been much more widely accepted in the marketplace."" Huh? You're left wondering if the mistake is at the start of the sentence or the end.I know this sounds like 2 minor examples, but there a lots of them in here and it makes this reading tougher than it should be. When you are trying to learn new material, having your source reference contain small mistakes is pretty frustrating."
2,Contents look like a laundry list!,"I purchased this book for my college class. Although it introduced me a broad concept of convergence, its poor organization gave me headaches whenever I needed quick references on certain topics.I believe anyone who sees its contents would have a hard time figuring out if there is ""any"" relationship between subtitles. Some subtitles had no reasons to be typed bold, while others should've been typed that way. Worse yet, the author summarized only certain issues, while he ignored many others with no clear explanations.Nonetheless, if you can endure such a disorganization, this book will be a gentle introduction to the field. Especially, Company Convergence Resources at the end of this book were quite useful for me."
4,Very durable but limited stance,"The kids love this toy and use it quite often, however, due to the running position, they can't really make it sitting with the rest of the pack of animals. As such, the running position is great for action moments but not much else. Still a great collector item and very detailed. These are hard in material so will hurt if accidentally dropped on a toe. This, however,makes them very durable. The paint detail CAN come off if scraped or chewed on (found that out on another figure by the same company) so they are not entirely damage-free."
1,If only I could give it less than 1 star,This was pretty bad - so bad that I didn't finish it. I actually had to stop reading before the hero & heroine even met b/c reading it was too painful. The 2 main female characters are ignorant as bricks and the dialogue is inane.
5,Heartstrings story!,This story made me laugh and cry! The characters are ones you could relate to. I liked this Book a lot and would recommend it to all my friends who appreciate a good historical romance!
4,Heartwarming,A very sweet telling of how true love will find you in the end. This is Romance at it's best.
4,Good Read!,"I greatly enjoyed this book. It is very similar to other romance novels, but sometimes that is all I'm looking for. You also can't beat the price!"
4,Amusing and Endearing,"I've ended up with quite a soft spot for this story and its characters - both the resulting couples. While Suzie is a grown woman she is still very childish at the outset and watching her grow up while also seeing Aengus wrestle with his extensive hurt and fears made for a very satisfying development and story arc on both counts.I enjoyed a sleepless night with my newborn just because I had this book to keep me engaged and happy to be awake reading onwards, I think that says a lot!"
4,Good read,"I enjoyed this book. Although I thought the main character, Suzy, was a little annoying I still enjoyed the story."
2,Unfeeling herione,This is an okay book. I like the supporting couple better then the main couple. However makes a good quick read.
4,Enjoyed,I enjoyed reading this book. The author had away of writting that made me smile in laugh. I did find the plot good but some of the arguments between the main characters were shrugged off a little bit too fast. I would have liked to see more of a challenge between the two. Otherwise I kept turning the pages because I couldn't stop reading.
4,This is cool! I like it!,"Well I've never heard of Echoing Green until just recently. I was at a music festival in Willmar Minnesota called ""SonShine"".They were there and I heard them and I went crazy! They are awesome! If you like Raze or World Wide Message Tribe you will love Echoing Green."
4,Almost Perfect,"I think the best way I can describe the Echoing Green is this. They are techno for people who hate techno. Ok ok, so E.G. fan's are probably screaming they're not techno, and I know. They're techno/rock/pop/whatever. My point is this. Whenever I ask someone why they hate techno I get the same response. It's so repeditive. That's when I recommend the Echoing Green. Not only are they able to put out great electronic music, but Joey has incredible lyrical abilities throughout an entire song. Not the usual catch phrase repeated over and over again in a lot of techno.As for this album, it's almost perfect. I'm not to partial towards the last few songs, but before that it's awesome. Anyone who grew up with 80's music must buy this album simply for E.G.'s cover of ""Safety Dance."" As for everyone else, I can guarantee you'll find at least one song to love on this album."
5,Really more electronic,"I got this cd after I got Supernova.But before I knew the group, I had the song Hide on one of my various artists cds. I thought it was an ok song until I found out my youth pastor had this cd and he played it in the car when we were going to the 2000 Youth Convention. When it played number 8 I thought it was a really cool song and I wanted it for Christmas but I got Supernova instead. I still got it after and when I listened to it I thought the other songs were cool too. Some songs like Saftey Dance and Tonight are not really christian songs but the rest are. The group does a really good job and doing really cool sound effects that make you daydrem about unrealiy things. I like all the songs but I really like Supermodel Citizen (Number 8 really electronical), Accidentlly 4th Street(Gloria), and The Power Cosmic. If you are an electronic fan you'd love this cd."
5,Joey b.'s done it again,WOW! This cd is one of the coolest christian techno cds out there. Joey b. really outdid himself on this one. He incorporated trance/dance/house/techno with great melodies and heartfelt lyrics. Plus added old favorites such as Freak Out and Safety Dance. Great cd. Every song is awesome.
4,Totally danceable and singable!,"If you like great lyrics, great beat and a techno sound...this is THE CD for you! First heard them on a Christian radio station in Columbus... RADIO U! ( radiou.com )"
1,"Nice dance music, not really Christian.","I found a copy of the song ""Hide"" on a Christian sampler CD. The song talks about hiding yourself in Jesus Christ, and I was impressed by the song, so I bought the CD. Unfortunately, that is the only song on the CD that mentions Jesus. There are a couple of others that reference ""The Son"" and ""a stone get rolled away,"" but overall, joey b.'s just hiding his faith.I was pretty disappointed with this artist trying to pass himself off as a Christian artist on a sampler, and then making the rest of the songs either covers of secular Rock music or bland, this-might-be-Christian allusions.For really great Christian techno and dance, see Praise House and Hypersonic."
3,Needs more depth,"Tessitore's biography of Kofi Annan leaves the reader with only very vague insight into the life of the seventh Secretary-General to the United Nations. After only a few pages, it becomes evident that the author himself couldn't possibly have known too much about Mr. Annan. Thus, it was no surprise to learn later that Tessitore had never even had an opportunity to interview with the UN Secretary-General.As a biography, Tessitore's account left me dissatisfied, since it gave me little detail about the life of Kofi Annan. It would be a perfect option for someone seeking only a very broad understanding of Mr. Annan's background. Considering he had access to scarce information himself, I guess Tessitore did a good job. But this begs the question: Why write a biography on a man you know very little about?"
2,Disappointment... I didnt see it coming... but there's always next time.,"I really havent even seen the best of armins older collections, but ive bought universal religion and a state of trance 2005... and loved them both, but this was just an utter disappointment.tracks 1-3 are good, while the rest arent up to par. Once this gold digger song hits... it's all over for this cd. But i really dont mind the featureless blah's of the downtempo-ish character on the rest of the cd for filling a void in my room... I guess its ok, but thats what the downtempo internet radio stations are for.So, All in all, it wasnt worth the $14.99 *fifteenUSD i paid for it. Hey, at least you will really enjoy the first few tracks if you decide to buy this... and look at it this way, you are supporting an artist to help them keep bringing out new stuff."
3,Armin van buuren is better than this. what is going on with him?,"i bought the cd last weekend, and is nor really what i was hopping for, some tracks are just there taking space, and wasting time, some other tracks, are just copletly out of place, the only reason i bought this cd, was beacuse of the last track (track 10)""serenity"" is just a awesome well done track , that epic melodic trance touch, makes you play it again and again, other than that the cd !!!!!sucks!!!!!!!! better luck next time mr. Armin Van Buuren."
3,Shivers,"Armin Van Buuren is a top-notch DJ and this album features his own work. Normally, Armin's mixing the work of other artists, but on 'Shivers' it's all about Armin.The CD is pretty good trance/ upbeat dance music. There is a nice variety of vocalists on the album. The songs seem to drag on for a little too long though.It is difficult to describe, but it feels like this CD is missing a special something to make it really stand out. There definitely are better trance/ dance albums out there than 'Shivers'.I would say it's worth a Used purchase at best."
4,Fresh,"Fresh and Ground Breaking Trance Breaks... Newest sounds, hard and edgy yet soft and supple. Great Vocal stuff. The FUTURE OF TRANCE."
3,Don't be fooled,"I am a huge fan of Armin's State of Trance series and when I got this I expected it to be more of the same. I was taken by suprise. This cd shows Armin branching out a little and exploring some different sounds than those heard on typical trance albums. While it does contain my personal favorite of his written tracks, Shivers, this cd also has some downtime to it. Not all of the tracks have a blasting bass line and fast tempo. It has more in commom with the beach disks of ASOT rather than the club ones. Overall, I like that Armin is exploring his music a little more and trying to escape the trappings of being pigeon-holed, but you have to realize that this is not another State of Trance year mix. This is exploration."
5,Now with pour spouts,I picked up this pan at a local foodie shop. I was pleased to see that All-Clad has improved the model this year. It now includes a pour spout on either side of the rim. The other reviewers are right on the money with the quality and versatility of this pan. I like this pan so much I am struggling to keep my self from buying a second one rather than diversifying my set.
5,On My Way was a great book,"Shania Twains' book was the best I have ever read. I am a big fan and this book told me everthing about her, and how she has grown into a big music star. This is an esential for anyone who calls themself a Shania Twain fan."
3,A little small,Seemed a bit small. I couldn't get it around my arm to fasten it properly. I can't comment on the actual function since I wasn't able to use it. I've returned it and will order one with a larger cuff.
5,Totally biased,"And I admit it. Read the novel, saw the film, enjoyed both. Realize Gabriel's music wasn't actually written for this film but cobbled together from other, prior works for the ""soundtrack."" At any rate, there are some very moving tracks in this album, especially for people who are tired of mainstream soundtracks. Best advice is to simply sample the tracks on Amazon and see if it floats your boat."
5,back cover read,"This colorful cookbook will take you on a culinary tour of American country inns, while providing you with two valuable kinds of useful information.

3,You've heard it all before,"I'm a tremendous fan of DJ Krush and was disappointed by this box set. Most of the material is from Meiso and Milight, I already own the cds and felt it was a little redundant to see live footage, music videos and studio recordings of songs I already owned. I was hoping for b-sides, demos, unreleased songs or videotaped freestyles, but did not receive any of that. I was also hoping to hear some more insight into who the esoteric DJ Krush really is, but the interviews he gives are pretty impersonal and boring.However, I am, like I said, a massive fan. I take some joy in owning material that could be considered rare or a collector's piece. I would recommend buying his cd's instead of this, but it might be nice to throw this dvd on in the background of a house party. This dvd is NOT a must-have, it is more of a luxury to add to a collection."
3,"Nicely done, but fairly useless","The book is well put together, but it's impossible for an English speaker to understand the various intonations used for vowels -- a book with an accompanying CD would be much more useful. Also, the type is so small that those of use over 40 need a magnifying glass to read it!"
5,Older from a favorite author,I was very happy to find this book by Sherryl Woods available. She has become a favorite of mine. The book arrived in very good condition and I will pass it on to my library.
4,excellent product for the price!,A camcorder with features found only on more expensive models and resonably easy to operate by a beginner. The quality of the picture was very good and the zoom operated very smoothly. Overall I felt it was a product that was well thought out in design and well made.
4,A Story You Won't Soon Forget,"Lee Hayes ...,A Story You Won't Soon ForgetSins From The Past is a refreshing, provocative and thought-provoking peek into the world of relationships and love. It is a story of laughter, joy, happiness and pain all tempered by a dose of reality. J. Aundre Clinton has done an excellent job of constructing realistic characters in a very believable world. The readers will find themselves turning the page to figure out what will happen next. Sins is well-written and forces the reader to critically examine their own lives, friendships and relationships in search of meaning, value and personal safety. Good job, Mr. Clinton...I wish you all the success in the world. I can't wait for the next!"
1,Awful,"This book is awful. Poorly developed characters. Stilted dialogue. Flimsy plot. More exclamation points than I thought were allowed. Lots of typos -- and worse, lots of messy prose. (""He had a million dollar smile, which was priceless."") Really, really awful."
3,"Nice, But Don't Buy It","All-Clad makes what is in my opinion an over priced fatally flawed product. I've owned several All-Clad pieces, including the 10-Inch Nonstick, and while they were good for awhile, the fry/saute pans all eventually warped. (Doubt me? Google All-Clad Warped.) If you cook over gas, it may or may not matter much, but on a ceramic cook top a warped pan is useless. It will heat unevenly and since it sits at an angle, oil will run to one side. Sure All-Clad, which is by the way no longer an American company, has a lifetime warranty, but I am currently in the fourth month of waiting for them to replace a 10-Inch non-stick which is perpetually ""out of stock"". So much for the warranty. Do yourself a favor, save $100, and buy a Wearever, and pay $20 for a truly excellent top-rated pan."
5,Great Pan!,"This All Clad 10 inch non-stick fry pan is truly non-stick and it heats and cooks evenly. We use it to make terrific omelets, pastas with cream sauces, and cheesy dishes like chicken pamesean. Now that we own several All Clad pans we rarely go out to eat. We make restaurant quality food right at home. From a quick batch of scrambled eggs to a cheesy chicken or pasta everything comes out beautifully. The only pan we use more often is the pan's cousin the All Clad stainless fry pan without the non-stick (but we need both because eggs and cheesy items work better with non-stick and browning meats and sauces work better in a regular pan). Get both and happy cooking!"
1,Lasted about three years.,"We used this pan about three years and then the non-stick coating wasno longer non-stick. An expensive lesson for something I never intended to replace.With all the research out there questioning the safety of non-stick surfaces, you'd be better off trying stainless or cast-iron. With a bit of work (seasoning), cast-iron can be nearly as slippery as a non-stick coating, and there's nothing that matches the traditional look and feel (and cooking ability) of cast-iron.Try a Lodge ""Logic"" cast-iron pan...very cheap at Walmart and other mass-retailers for $10-$20.You can't go wrong, and you'll never buy ""non-stick"" cookware again."
1,Forget all Alclad Non Stick,"After buying 4 Alclad non stick fry pans that have all turned to rubbish, I can onlysay DON'T buy then. They make wonderful stainless goods, but don't seem to have a clueon how to manufacture non stick products. When I can go to Walmart and buy a cheapTfal pan and use it for years, still cook eggs with no problem and run it thru thedishwasher year after year, one wonders why Alclad engineers can't do better.They won't stand by their goods and hide behind a warranty disclaimer that states youCAN'T put it thru a dishwasher. What planet do they come from ?"
2,non stick pan stainless all-clad,great pan love that it is american made only problem is the pan warped upward in the middle i use on induction cooktop
5,"Great pan, great price","I had recently seen this pan reviewed in Cook's Illustrated Magazine as being a best buy for non-stick skillets, so I was happy to find it at such a reasonable price from this seller. The pan has not disappointed!"
3,Made in China,"Just bought the 10"" and 8"" All-Clad non-stick frying pans for $80 at BB&B. Quite heavily made. Made an omelet and it didn't stick. Annoys me that they charge so much for stuff made in China."
3,Expected better for the price,"This is my most-used pan. My only beef is that the non-stick coating degrades over time. The coating desn't flake off like cheaper immitations, but it does wear away. After a couple of years, it just wasn't working. Frying an egg is the ultimate test of a non-stick. They slide around the pan when the pan is new. I returned it to All-Clad, and they replaced it with a new one. I'm now on my second pan and after another couple of years, it's going the same way. I can't complain about customer service, as they gave me a new pan without any original packaging or a receipt.I wash the pan by hand and I never use metalic utensils in it. I never use it inside the oven. I think as far as non-sticks go, this is a fine product. I just don't think there is such a thing as a non-stick that can last that long. If All-Clad are happy to keep replacing my pan, then I guess I'll stick with it."
2,Awful warranty and poor customer service,"This pan is great when new. However, when you spend $125 on a pan, you expect to use it for a long time. Unfortunately, after a year or so, this pan started to develop a sticky film that compromised the non-stick cooking surface. All-Clad refused to exchange the pan for a new one, despite the fact that we followed their instructions with respect to heat and cleaning.Bottom line is that you should stick with all-clad for stainless cookware. For non-stick, go with a cheaper alternative that you don't mind replacing every couple of years because All-Clad will not stand by their product."
3,Not even this nonstick lasts forever,"I have just about avery All-Clad pot or pan. The non sticks are no worse than others out there but, they do eventually flake off their nonstick surface. I did return mine for a full refund after 3 years of use which was nice. However, when it comes to nonstick, that is one time when I would opt for a cheaper version that I won't feel bad throwing away."
1,Save Your Money if You Want Nonstick,"I'm not giving this pan a low rating because it isn't good, just that it likely isn't going to last long enough for the average home cook to justify its high price. We have a set of All Clad stainless that we've used for fifteen years, and we love it. We also used to have a nonstick All Clad frypan that we threw away after two or three years. Yes, you could baby your nonstick, and just use it to cook omelets, it would be great for that and might last forever, but if you want a nonstick frypan for frying most foods, at a higher heat, All Clad won't last longer than cheaper pans. We've come to realize that a medium priced nonstick pan that distributes heat well and can be replaced without breaking the bank makes the most sense, at least for us."
2,Not What You Would Expect From All-Clad,Nonstick coating peels off around the edges. The handle is way too heavy causing the pan to sit unevenly unless you put alot of food in the pan on the side away from the handle.
1,not what I thought it was,"I expected the book to be about lifestyle not house design. It seem typical for what has become of Key West - overbuilt, with a narrow view on style. Key West style to me is an internal thing, not how a house looks or is furnished! I returned this product."
1,Lost Memories,I gave my wife a Sureshot 85 for Christmas. The picture quality was fair. The subjects were ghostly white from a flash that was too strong. We took pictures of my daughters first ski lessons. The camera would not work with the lens fully extended. All pictures taken with the lens extended were blurred. The same thing happened at my daughters birthday party the following week. The pictures were blurred or undstinguishable at any setting when the zoom lens was used. I'm loking for a new camera. It won't be a Canon!
3,A good value,"This snowshoe is easy to use and provides good traction. Considering the price, it's a good value. My only real complaint is the adjustability...I couldn't snug the toe box in for a tight side-to-side fit, and the straps needed to be tightened from time to time.Overall, a completely adequate snowshoe for a good price."
4,Snowshoe Review,I was very pleased with Amazon's customer service and delivery time of the snowshoes. They are great!!
2,What???,"Silly (and not in a good way!)I read this to my daughter to start preparing her for to begin school and found the storyline silly and nonsensical. The story seemed too contrived and over-done. The pictures were nice, but that is about it.Even my daughter was bored, and she likes silly books..."
1,Piece of Garbage. Created HW Probs on D-Link router,"I attached this antenna to a D-Link DI-624 wireless router to try to expand the range then all of the wired ethernet ports started dropping connectivity and I was getting ""hardware error"" reports from the network monitor.Took the antenna off and it all worked fine again. You would think D-Link would have at least tested this with their own product."
1,Bogus Antenna,"This is a bogus product, did not extend my wireless range even by an inch. Its really unfortunate that now I have to pay shipping and return shipping to get some of my money back."
2,Don't get your hopes up!,Product description for this antenna led me to believe that my wireless signal would be stronger and farther. This antenna did not improve my wireless signal.
5,D-Link 2.4GHz Omni-Directional Helped,"Second home office was upstairs and across the house from wireless router location. Would get ""poor"" (0 to 1 bar)or no connection prior to installing the ant24-0700. Now I the reception is consistently ""good"" with 2-4 bars. Antenna angle on both the sending and receiving device is important."
3,D-Link - Indoor antenna,It has improved reception of the network. So it's a good value for the price.
5,d-link antenna,"I have to admit that I was skeptical as to whether my problem was antenna connected or this would help. But it sure did. My wireless router is located in my basement and our computers are on the first and second floor of my house. Often times our signal was weak and the strength of our neighbors signal was as strong as ours. My wife, who is less patient about finicky technology than I am, forced the decision, and I am glad she did. I put the antenna in and it solved all of our problems. The signal is very strong on both floors and now there is never a connection issue. I have noticed the signal is more sensitive to our (2.4 ghz) cordless phone than before. But this is to be expected size they are the same frequency."
4,Definitely helped signal strength and range,"Our house has 6 inch concrete walls, and signal strength from one end to the other and also outside was very weak. Installation of the 7dBi antenna gave me significantly higher strength and range, and only took a minute to install."
1,Did not improve reception at all...,I wouldn't waste the money on this again if I knew how little it did for the unit. This didn't boost the signal at all.
3,It works!,Better than the receiver alone. Roughly a 25% increase in wireless reception. Good enough now for continuous streaming. No more buffering!
2,Minimal benefit...,"I installed the antenna in a good location but realized little, if any, improvement in my reception. It was easy to install which is the only positive thing I have to say."
2,It did not help,Sorry. Did not work for me. I took a chance and lost. I needed to increase the range on my FIOS router to reach my basement. It was easy to install but it did not increase the strength or range of the signal.
3,I need more power Scotty,"After I fought the packaging (normal these days) installation was easy and straight forward. I then went to the areas of my home where the signal had been weak or no signal at all. The results were a bit disappointing. the three bar areas were now four, but the two bar areas hadn't changed at all. The no signal areas were now one bar but I was unable to connect. Given the price the product is good if you need a little boast."
4,Reception boost,"We have a three level home (finished walk-out basement) with wifi connected computers and Xbox spread out over the three levels. This antenna did improve reception for each computer. ""Poor"" went to ""good"", ""Good"" went to ""excellent"", and miserable went to mediocre. An improvement for sure, but don't assume it will deliver wifi to a location you can't already receive it."
2,d-link antenna,Before purchasing this extended range antenna I read all the reviews and a majority seemed favorable.One person commented that it depends on the equipment and the configuration of the building.I was trying to strenghten the signal to the outside deck.It didn't work any better than the router I have from Time Warner cable.It performed exactly the same no matter where I put it or the direction I pointed the antenna.The only way I could increase the signal to the deck was to put it outside than I would lose signal strength inside so I returned it.
1,no improvement,I replaced the antenna on my DI-624 router.I am able to extend the antenna 4-5 ft from the base.But I don't see any signal improvement on my laptop or desktop that'son wifi.
2,No Panacea,"This item did not do much for me as far as increasing the range of my router. I live in a three story home and did not see much of a difference between the OEM antenna and this one. I returned mine, I think it is a waste of money if you are looking to improve your range. If you need a replacement it will do the trick."
2,No improvement from DIR-655,"I purchased this to improve the signal from a DIR-655 to an xbox360. Intention is to stream HD video. Reviewing the signal strength on the media center network tuner did not show any increase, it is still 1 line below HD signal strength requirement. No improvement in the quality of the video displayed was observed."
4,It does make a difference,I bought this about 6 months ago. My home office computer is about 50 feet from the D Link router through steel reinforced concrete walls. I usually get a very low wireless signal with frequent drop outs. When I tried the antenna 6 months ago it made no difference. I just tried it again as I was losing my signal. I attached it directly to the router and set it vertical as advised. I now have a 2 to 3 bar signal. From the reviews I gathered that it's kind of a hit or miss purchase but I'm glad that I didn't write it off at first impression and that it's now working for me. I'd give it 5 stars but I think it's a little overpriced. ( I paid $37)
3,"It work, but not i expected","It works fine, but it only help to increase ""one bar"" of signal. But only cost me around $20, cus' i am good at it"
1,Does virtually nothing,Made almost no improvement. The magnetic base is neat. I think it was added to distract you from the fact that you just paid $30 for a copper wire and plastic paperweight.
2,Rebate Rip-off,"This product is actually pretty good however, the D-Link Rebate offer is one of the biggest rip-offs I have ever come across.I had my rebate rejected because they said the purchase was made outside of the qualifying period.The rebate form clearly reads 12/31/09 30 days after purchase however they claim it reads September 31 rather than December.The representative I talked to on the phone actually told me that the date I was seeing on the copy of the form I had in front of me was not the same as the on he had.He finally agreed to let me send it in again only to have it rejected again for the same load of BS.I wont be purchasing anything from D-Link again."
3,Works a little,"I bought this antenna amplifier to try to increase my wife's notebook's WIFI reception. It worked a little. She sometimes can get better receiption if she's in the right location downstairs. Unfortunetly I have to extend the antenna's wire fully and place it closer to my computer room door to get her slight increase.PROS: My netbook reception is much better and I like the long wire that allows the antenna to extend into the room off of my computer desk.CONS: The base magnets scare me around my electronic equipment. I wish they were removeable. I have external hard drives all over my desk and I am affraid the magnets might erase something. Also, I wish it worked for my wife so she'd stop complaining about the network dropoffs."
2,money better spent,We received just a small jump in an improved signal with no noticeable improvement in speed from this antenna. I would highly recommend spending a few more dollars on a powerline adapter kit instead. We've had great performance from Netgear.
2,Antenna worse than router's built-in antenna,"Bought this to use with my Verizon FiOS service because I don't quite get good enough reception in my house. Using diagnostic tools, I quickly discovered that this did not work as well as the router's built-in antenna. Maybe worth it if you're using it with a laptop or something else with a very poorly located antenna."
2,Not a significant improvement,I live in an apartment with solid plaster walls. The signal needs to go through 2 walls. I don't see much improvement with this antenna.
3,Improvement but not the complete answer,"Summary: Worth the $16 (after rebate) to get a small improvement in signal.My house is made of concrete and 3.5 stories high. The antenna improved my reception by ""one bar"". This was appreciated and did improve my connection reliability or transfer speed. It did not create a huge difference, thus only giving 3 stars.The most important benefit is having the ability to move the antenna away from the wireless router, based on the cable that is supplied. This gave me the opportunity to maximize the signal strength without having to move my router.As other people have noted, make sure you know that the antenna signal is orthogonal (perpendicular). Do NOT point the antenna at your computer. This will only weaken the signal."
2,What For!!,This D-Link ant did nothing for me. I use it to try to get a better signal on Clear Modem. Think 7db is more like no db. There just was no gain for me. I return it back to Amazon.
4,Worked for me,"My wireless router is in my office in the basement. When I took my laptop to the first floor the signal strength was ""Very Good"" or ""Good"". When I first installed this antenna, it didn't make a difference and I was going to write it off, but I went through the instruction manual. The key to making this antenna work is the way you position it. For example if you keep the antenna vertical as you see in the picture on amazon, it transmits the signal in a horizontal circle. Like a dinner plate set on the dining table. If you are trying to send the signal to other rooms on the same level, this helps. However, it doesnt help if you are trying to send boost the signal to a level above or below the route. You need to position the antenna horizontally, (i.e, parallel to the floor) to send the signal in a vertical circle. My signal strength is now excellent to very good on the first floor and very good to good on the second level with the router in the basement. Hope this helps."
4,Works Great!,"We have tried several different solutions for providing an Internet connection to my children's PC. We bought it for them to do their homework on and play games since they were tying up our other two computers (one used for our home based business). The problem was that we live in a very old and big house, making running cable very problematic. The obvious solution was wireless. We went out and bought all of the needed parts (all d-link), but the kid's room was *just* outside the range of the signal. Using the D-Link 2.4GHz Omni-Directional 7dBi Indoor Antenna ( ANT24-0700 ) solved this problem. It also took less than 1 minute to replace the old antenna with this one. This was just what we needed!"
4,"excellent, but dont expect miracles either","You can connect this to either your router or to your wireless card (assuming it has the type of anntenna you can detach).In eiher case you can boost your signal around 20% in normal real-world scenarios. If you need more of a boost than that, you may be disappointed by your results. There is no wireless antenna that can really boost more than that. At that point, you should invest in a new wireless router, or buy a 2nd router to extend the range of your current wireless."
2,Disappointed,"I was getting a ""poor to good"" signal prior to attaching the antenna. Have not noticed much of an improvement. Access point is on 1st floor at one end of house. PC with worst signal that I'm trying to improve on is on second floor other end of house from access point. Wish I could return this but after cost of S&H and insurance, is not cost effective to do so. Chalk it up as a lost."
1,too directional,"This antenna is TOO directional. Once I hooked it up, network reception was very good in a very limited area, but got much worse overall. I was never able to aim it in such a way as to provide acceptable reception in all relevant areas of my house. I finally abandoned it in favor of the original antenna that came with my router. For me, it was a waste of money."
1,Incompatible Product,The product was incompatible with my Belkin router. Unlike some of the earlier reviews it is impossible to remove the current antenna on your router and replace it with this one. Take my advice and replace your router itself. You will save yourself time and frustration. The new MIMO technology and N-router have made this product obsolete.
1,Worthless,Connected to a D-link WBR 1310 it did NOTHING. A field strength meter show no difference in signal at 25 feet.
1,not great,Sorry but this did not extend my range at all-as far as I can tell.From the above reviews it seems that the construction of your house (walls etc ) makes a difference -so it is a gamble if it will work. I would have expected at this stage 2005 that the antenna would function as described -perhaps this model is obsolete .The company does advertise other extenders perhaps they work better .Would hve returned it for anther model but to much trouble.
1,does absolutely nothing,"save your money, folks! I looked at the review histogram and thought that the odds are in my favor that it would work for me. wrong! does absolutely nothing. but don't believe me? try it for yourself. just make sure you save your receipt and packaging so you can return it when you get the same results."
3,D-Link 2.4GHz Omni-Directional 7dBi Indoor Antenna,I am not sure that this helped my situation. It appears that I have the same level of power and reception now as i has before installing the antenna.
2,Did not work on my router but works great on my adapter,I originally bought this antenna to attach to my Netgear router. It actually made the signal strength WORST. I adjusted the angle of the antenna several ways without any luck.I was about to toss it in the trash when I got the idea to attach it to my D-Link DWA-552 Xtreme N Wireless PCI Adapter on the back of my gaming rig. My signal strength went from 2 bars to a full 5 bars. Its nice but I bought it with the intention to use it on my router so I'm dissatisfied.
5,Siouxsie Sioux and her JuJu!,"If you're a fan of the band's earlier releases, this CD does not disappoint. It has all the darkly obscure topics tinged with a touch of camp. Makes me want to do a rag doll dance too!"
4,Progressive concept album,"Lady Macbeth is a concept album, in which Lana Lane casts herself in the role of one of Shakespeare's more memorable characters. In the Shakespeare play, Lady Macbeth urges her husband to seize power through murder. But once he has become king of Scotland, she is overcome with guilt, and dies before Macbeth himself is overthrown. The songs do not simply summarize the plot of the play. Rather, the lyrics are about ambition, and disappointment. The music is a bit harder than on most of Lana Lane's releases, with a blend of slow and fast songs, and some instrumental interludes. The arrangements are Lana's trademark combination of heavy guitars and keyboard backgrounds. The opening track is outstanding, very reminiscent of Deep Purple, while everything else is pleasant and listenable."
4,Great Book,This book is really cool. The designs can be mixed or matched to make a wide variety of designs. The book gives you ideas on how to match the blocks up to make designs that are very different and very interesting. It is also easy to use and make the blocks.
4,Entertaining look at history,"The series is entertaining and informative, each show being forty-five minutes or so, so they really cannot get into much detail. It was, however, enjoyable to watch. Glad to find the series available."
3,"For what there is available on this subject via documentary..it is ""alright""..but still not very good","the biggest complaint i have is that each episode looks , sounds the same..and each is too ""Generic"". Plus it is usual history channel style of narration and just irritating and ""movie like"" to listen to and many of the American commentators just seem arrogant and superficial understanding. (nothing against Americans in general..but the education style and system is really not up to par with British and European. )"
2,This is NOT X-COM,"The second I saw the box, it reminded of an old game I had previously owned. But for the life of me, I couldn't remember which one. While driving home after purchasing Nemesis, I started to recall what it had reminded me. Of course, it was ""X-COM""! Lord, what an awesome game that was! I was so excited to jump in & play Nemesis! Unfortunately, the excitement didn't last very long.Here's the bottom line: this game is NOT X-COM. The way you control your squad is similar to the original, but the game play just doesn't have the same excitement that the original series did. Maybe it's because it's too complicated now, or maybe it's just because I'm older now. Hard to say, but please, don't waste your $20.00 thinking it's anything like the old X-Com. You'll be disappointed."
3,Too big for my Induction Cooktop burners,"I have one of those Kenmore Elite Induction Cook-tops which I just love. It only accepts magnetic pans so I use the entire All-Clad line.I've often wished for a fry pan in a larger size than the standard 12"" and was really excited to discover the 14"" version.My excitement turned into disappointment, however, when I tried to use the pan for the first time. It's larger than the burner and will not activate the stove-top because of that. My largest burners are 10"" and the 12"" pan works fine. But the 14"" pan is simply too big.So if you are using Induction Cooking, beware. Great company, great pans. But this one comes with constraints. I wish someone had warned me because I'd already thrown away the packaging before I made the discovery and these pans are not cheap."
2,Not a durable surface.,"I purchased this fry pan in June of this year - and it is almost to a state where it is ready to be thrown away as of December 1st. I would have expected the nonstick surface to be of superior quality and durability from All-Clad, but the sad truth is that I have had cheap grocery store pans that have maintained the coating far longer, and a small fraction of the cost. After just a few weeks the surface became scratched on this pan and the coating started to come off in the food - ick! I love the uncoated All-Clad, but I will be looking elsewhere for nonstick in the future."
2,Disappointing compared to other All Clad,"Same problem - the surface has begun to deteriorate. We use this pan daily, always using appropriate implements and washing by hand, but still the non-stick surface has broken down. I am going to contact All Clad to see if they will stand by their product and replace..."
4,Better than expected,"I cooked hamburger first day I purchased all-clad fry pan and was surprized that fry pan can make so much different test. I like it very much but one problem this fry pan should sell with lid. Otherwise, is good to have it."
5,2 Quart Saucier Pan,The 2 Quart Saucier Pan has been an incredibly wonderful addition to my set. I absolutely love its versatility and its sleek looks.
5,I heart my glorified ramen pot,"This is a very versatile pot. I use it for ramen, spaghetti, tortellini, udon, boiling potstickers, boiling veggies, cooking soup, making mashed potatoes. Everything cooks evenly, cleaning (I handwash) is a snap. Having a lid is wonderful for steaming veggies (with an oxo steamer insert I use). For a single person who likes to eat well it is quite possibly the most useful pot ever - AND of course since it's all clad, it is really gorgeous. Just having it hanging above my range makes my kitchen look fancier. What more could you ask for, really?Recommend it for single people, or for people who love to cook."
5,One of the best pans for the kitchen,"If you are just starting to put your 'well appointed' kitchen together, this pan is a must. Besides being made by All Clad, which means a life time, if you take care of it, of flawless service, the design is perfect for just about anything needing a saucepan. Hot cereal, sauces, custards, rice, etc etc.... I absolutely love this pan. Yes, I am a big All Clad user, when they are made in America. Stay away from the Chinese All Clad, they are producing an inferior product for an otherwise superior brand."
1,The Worse Preperation for the ASVAB,"I bought this book to assist me in studying for the ASVAB so that I could get into Oficcer Candidate School (OCS). In order to get into OCS you need a GT score of 110 or higher. Luckily enough, I took a practice exam after studying with this and got a GT score of an 84! I found that thwere were things on the practice exam that were not even covered in this book! In the the end, what the considered to be ""The Best Preperation for the ASVAB"" eneded up being the WORSE PREPERATION FOR THE ASVAB. I recommend everyone pick up the book entitled ""ASVAB Basics (2004)"" and ""30 Days to the ASVAB"" great books that wok hand in hand together. By using these twqo books, I ended up scoring a GT score of 120! I also scored an AFQT score of 88 which allows me to choose whatever work field I would like to go into...OCS, here I come!"
4,pretty well.,the description was right plus it came with a cd that would help you study. I recommend this to people who are looking for a quick study guide with basic knowledge that will help them on the asvab.
2,NOT HAPPY WITH SELLER!,"I ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT THE SELLER AND UNABLE TO GET A HOLD VIA PHONE OR EMIAL...I WANTED THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT INCLUDED A CD FOR EXTRA PRACTISE, BUT I NEVER RECIEVED THE CD. NOT HAPPY AT ALL!"
2,funnel,"This fits near the radiator cap but doesn't stand securely. I haven't found an alternative but shape is ok (a little small) for this. Easy to carry, though."
5,A good everything book,"Good reading - gives a Christian slant to some items. Good nuts and bolts for practical readiness - emotional, financial, etc."
4,Biblia Catholica Bilingue - Muy Buen,"I am a Catholic student to espanol. I love to read the Bible also. I think this product is great. Only problem I have is the type is too small for me. I have to use a magnifying glass. Otherwise, it is perfect for my needs."
5,Brilliant!!,"What I wonder is how such a young woman possesses such depth and understanding of her emotions? Reading this book, I was comforted to know that I am not alone in some of the most private feelings I have. And it is okay to question the world around you. A MUST READ... every woman should have one for the obvious reasons and every man should have one to begin to understand the complexities of women."
4,Good.. except the music coverups,"I love this show. I am very glad it is on DVD, but once again the music coverups are so distracting. As I am currently in the middle of watching the episode with the various video shoots, I actually stopped the DVD and came online to try and figure out if anyone else was bothered by it. They chose absolutely terrible songs to play as well. Ugh. That is disappointing, but the rest of the DVD is nice, including the extra features."
3,no subtitle?,no english subtitle! GESH! I love this show and have been waiting for this for a year and finally bought this recently. One huge disappointment is that there's no subtitle included. MTV makes a lot of money and they can't even include english subtitle for deaf and hoh? Should've read technical info before purchasing this otherwise I wouldn't have waste it $ on dvds with no english subtitle.I love love love this show a LOT but I'm giving this a 3 stars because of subtitle wasn't included for deaf and hoh or for foreign people.
5,YAY,"Not since the Nick & Jessica Smile Time Variety Hour have i been this excited. Heck, I was excited when i saw them singing A Whole New World on the Aladdin DVD, but now we can all enjoy Newlyweds on DVD"
3,THE MUSIC RUINS IT,"Honestly, this DVD could be great it they had not done (as one reviewer so perfectly described it) the ""Cheesy-ass tunes"". I think the same thing....It's Nick and Jessica's show - they are making money off of these DVD sales...so why in the episodes where they have their music, do they put generic stuff over it? In addition, if they can get rights to use the music on TV, the rights should be there for the DVD, as well. For Jessica's birthday party at Concorde, when they are dancing to 50 cent's ""It's your Birthday"", they play some random music, but yet their lips are going to 50 cent's song - so it all looks unnatural. It's probably not bad if you never watched the show on TV, but I was pretty disappointed. Buy a burned copy of all 3 seasons off of ebay from someone who got it all off of the TV....thats your best bet!"
1,1 Star is too many!,"I just can't believe this! The series released on DVD and so many 5-star ratings? Some folk even state it as being their favourite show? What is wrong with people these days? Some wouldn't know a good show if it jumped up and down on their nose wearing tap shoes and a suit of armour, singing ""Tra-La-La-Boom-De-Ay"". I would rather sit through 10 hours of the test card, than an hour of this.At least it showed how shallow and meaningless celebrity marriages are. I have socks that lasted longer and never stunk as much.I know everyone has their own opinions and tastes, but for someone to actually ""LIKE"" this, let alone ""LOVE"" it just blows my mind!But then again...if you have the I.Q. of a slug, then I am sure you will love this. Enjoy!!"
3,How Stupid Can You Get,"Man, Jessica Simpson has GOT to be the dumbest bubble head on the planet. Jessica is nothing but a rich brat who has no real talents other then looking good and making medicore bubblegum pop music.Jessica is the ultimate spoiled bimbo who should were a dunce cap. The episodes she thinks Chicken of the Sea tuna is made of chicken or where she thinks buffalo wings are made of buffalo. You get the idea."
2,Is this chicken or fish I'm eating?,"With that one line, Jessica Simpson went from being a D/C grade level celebrity to being one of the most beloved, well known airheads. The show itself was kind of lame, neither she nor Nick is the sharpest tool in the shead, but they at least have a few entertaining moments here and there. I don't care for reality TV shows at all, but I gave this one a shot. I gave it 2 stars for the chicken or fish comment, and that one scene where she spent $2000+ on underwear and pissed him off. Otherwise it was just another show that you watch because it's on."
1,Quality of DVD,I ordered this for a present over xmas - it ended up arriving earlier than expected and hence this was great news. Just a little unsure of the quality of the DVD as it does not seem to be of original/copyrighted quality - i.e there is no main menu and the audio seems to be a little out of sinc.I would apprecaite some follow up regarding this as to where to go with the issue.On a positive note it appears that all of the other DVDs are of high quality and do not share the same issue.Regards
1,Watch it on mTV once,"Why would you buy Newlyweds on dvd? If you're so obsessed with Jessica Simpson or Nick as to get a dvd of them ""doing stuff"", you should go see a shrink. Get a life people."
5,A LIFE SAVER when our SmartPhone died,"My husband and I were visiting Toronto from Indiana to look for apartments. We circled all the locations we had appointments at and times...just in case. Are we SO glad we did!! Our SmartPhone had a glitch when we entered CANADA and this map helped us zig zag back and forth across the city SEVERAL times in 3 days.For the City of Toronto:NORTH it goes up to Eglinton AveWEST it has a bit of Dundas, but all of Lansdowne (does not have the High Park area - which would have been helpful)SOUTH all the islandsEAST to Coxwell AveWe've not used StreetWise maps, but probably will not, as this beauty was SO terrific - also has the SUBWAY system with stops mapped out - which we did not use, but will next time we are there."
4,Close to what I expected,"I bought the Chrome Hotel Towel rack a few weeks ago, and it works exactly as advertised. However, there are two things that would be great: 1) a slightly larger space on the two bath towels, because an oversized towel or big bath towel won't fit even when ""properly"" folded; 2) there is only a single screw hole in two spots rather than four or even six screws, which would give it much more stability on the the wall. In addition, we ended up going to the home store and just picking up two chrome ""S"" hooks to allow us to hang down additional towels."
1,Don't buy it!,"I thought I chose carefully, but this piece is tiny! It can hold hand towels and face towels. The ad carefully does not give dimensions - the space between the bars where you insert the towel is 2 3/4"" wide, and the bar area it sits on is 6 1/4"" by 4"". No large towel could be folded and adequately held here. When I saw the box it was in, I thought the piece must need assembly. What a disappointment!"
4,good item for smal space,"My guest bath didn't have a lot of space for extra towels and the linen closet is around the corner. I was surprised that this item was smaller than I thought it would be, but it holds two guest towels, a hand towel, and wash cloths in a very small space and works great."
2,Not worth the money,"The information in this book was good, though it could've been better. It covered alot of stuff that was unnecessary for the A+ test. The exams in the book were absolutely AWEFULL! If you get this don't even use the practice exams. For exam questions I also got Coriolis A+ Exam Cram. I took and passed the A+ today w/ 84% Core and 89% Dos/Windows, and I fill the Coriolis book was very accurate!Good Luck!"
4,Another great study guide by Syngress!,"I have been through more than 7 of this series and this A+ book keeps up with the positive reputation of Syngress. Very well written, to the point and comprehensive. Used it to pass my A+ exam with a 96. Even if your not heading for the A+ exam, this one will give you a good understanding of computer hardware and troubleshooting."
2,This book was not very useful for the A+ test,"I concur with most of the other reviews performed about this book. I was fortunate enough to borrow my friends Exam Cram book, and also access other web sites such as abctesting.com, before actually taking the test. The way questions are formatted on the real test is almost 180 degrees different than the books method. I do not recommend this book as your only test preparation material."
1,A+ Cert. DOES NOT GET YOU READY FOR TEST,"Good overview of overall concepts, but not as final prep for test. Does not emphasize the specifics needed for to past the test.Great book to start for someone with little or no computer background. Not good for tech who is studing up for test."
5,its a book with great explanations,"it is a book that clearly conveys to the reader how to install upgrade and do complex things you would regulary get confused by large words in other books, but this is the most down to earth english book."
2,Good info but throws you off the trail. Buy something else.,"I agree with a lot of the others. THE MAIN PROBLEM is that most of the sample questions have multiple answers. The real test does not. Waaaaaay too many dumb obvious questions are presented to you that are just not on the real test. Thanks a lot guys. You really fooled me. I thought I was ready but I bombed. I won't give up because of you though. Rome wasn't built in a day...Still learned a lot, but did not prepare me for the real reason-to pass the test."
1,This book STINKS!!!!!!,"Damn, this book STINKS!!! It was totally WORTHLESS to me for my test; I had to rely almost entirely on my experience and very little on the info in this book. It BLOWS!!! Using this book was only a little better than not studying at all!!!"
1,Find another study guide or use the web,"While this book is organized according to the A+ exam objectives, it's apparent the author didn't do enough research or have the time to include the relevant knowledge tested on the exam. 50% of what you need to know is covered for the Core Exam. The Windows/DOS exam section is almost useless. My advice is to find another study guide or use the web. I passed both exams scoring in the 90's, but no thanks to this study guide."
2,Worth half the price,"I am a classic CNE looking for more certification, I was given this book as a christmas present and was very disappointed in it's content. In Canada the cost is $71.95 so it is expected to be better than it is. The CD, which I thought would be great, was a waste of time with most of the software being extremely buggy and useless. Shop around and read reviews from this site before purchasing. I wish I had, now I have to purchase something else to study with, I would not attempt to write with the limited knowledge this book gives."
3,"When I first read the book it was very hard to understand,","After I recieved the book as a gift the first thing that I did was open it up and skim through it. I found it very hard to understand, even with my dad being a computer technitian he found it very hard to understand. I would recommend that you wait for the second edition pof the book when most of the mistakes and hard to understand things are cleared up"
3,Do not buy this book for the CD,"I was disappointed with the CD. Three of the five demos would not install or the wrong material would be installed. Example, STS A+ Test had an expired software license. The MindWorks' PRELIM software would not let you log on. And, the IBID'S A+ Demo used the WIN95 test as the demo. The 500 test questions advertised do not exist. Finally, the book lacked detailed information on a lots of the subject matter."
3,Try Something Else,"I did little research before buying this book/set. Do yourself a favor and look at another book. Errors are not good to help you pass the exam. The CD was good as a beverage coaster, but nothing more than that. I wound up passing the exam using other material."
1,Don't buy this book - Wait for the 2nd edition,The book has a wide array of errors that are not easily caught. This book would be a good choice if it was not for these errors. I would wait until the 2nd edition was printed.
4,Nisa Talks and Still Keeps Her Secrets,"Nisa talks a great deal, but somehow the inner life of the !Kung is never revealed. A trance state is referred to throughout the book, but what does it feel like when one is ""trancing""? One dies and goes to some indeterminate place ""up there""? I realize it is impossible for a European to live like a !Kung among the !Kung because of the wide economic disparities and the tradition of gift exchange (among the many problems the author acknowledges right from the start of the book) but a deeper look into their interior life would have been welcomed.Despite Nisa's stilted language, which may be the fault of the translator, there is much to learn here."
5,Wonderful,"This book (and the work of anthropologist Marjorie Shostak that created it) is wonderful! I was instantly full-blown absorbed and was so excited to hear there is a sequel! I especially recommend this book to all my women friends, young and old. Totally awesome author. Totally awesome book."
4,This book was very easy to read.,"I found this book to be very enjoyable to read. It was very well thought out and the anthropological view in its entirety was very understanding. Myself, being a student at the University of Pittsburgh, and hoping to persue a career as an anthropology major in the future, would have to give this book two thumbs up on the outstanding field-work of Majorie Shostak. The way in which she presented the book was amazing and kept the reader fully interested."
3,Satisfactory,"The CD serves it's purpose, but the songs miss out on the real style of the original performers."
1,not available outside US,"I tried to download this. I am a huge fan of Laurie Anderson and I'm sure I'd be giving it a five-star rating - if I could see it. But the video cannot be downloaded or streamed to any computer physically located outside the US, as I am. Given its subject, and the fact that Amazon is promoting it using an interview given to a British newspaper about the performance of the work in Britain, I'm sure there are delicious layers of geopolitical irony here. But mostly I'm just p'd off. When will this be available outside the US?"
1,One sided view of religion,"This book is about as far from ""scholarly"" as one could get. It appears that he just wrote each ""religion"" and asked them what they would like him to say about them. It appears no research was done on anything that the ""religions"" told him, he mainly printed verbatim whatever they told him to write. In the case of Jim Jones and Scientology, works that are negative are never mentioned. You would think that there is no controversy at all with these two cults, just flowers and rainbows!If you live in Oz or Atlantis this might be a good resource. All others steer clear.I am an author and information specialist with a couple of Master's degrees. I have done a lot of research on religions and would not recommend this book to anybody."
5,Great,I knew Jennifer when we were played in a cover band together back in late 80's. I'm glad to see she has realesed her own CD. She is an incredible singer. Hopefully we will hear more from her soon.
3,Got burned too.......maybe. LOOK FOR THE ALLCLAD STAMP ON BOTTOM !!!,"We never owned, nor looked at any All-Clad cookware in a store before. Just started shopping around the 'net for a GOOD QUALITY fry pan. I Liked this one and had it shipped. Came in no problem; how was I to know that All-Clad puts a stamp on the bottom of their cookware. Do they? I just read the one star review from {tjbuild87} about how his(her) pan is bogus and decided to inspect mine. Guess what, no stamp. I don't remember who I purchased it from, it's been a few years now. It works good tho.I also later bought an 8"" pan and that one has a stamp on the bottom.The BIG question being,how to tell if what is sold to you is legit or not.Any help out there?"
5,Good Pan,"This is a good pan. I use it mostly for sautéing and searing meats. It been used 4 or 5 nights a week for nearly a year and shows no signs of wear. It heats evenly across the surface and retains that heat well while adding ingredients. Clean-up is straight forward, warm soapy water, a scrub and its good as new. It may be a touch pricy but I fully expect this pan to last me at least a decade if not longer which makes it well worth that price."
4,Very slick,"Pan works great. Distributes heat evenly, which is what I was looking forward. No problem with sticking."
1,I am less than impressed,"I am completely underwhelmed by the famous All-Clad fry pan. It's supposed to be 10-inches. In fact its working surface is less than 7 1/2-inches. It is also very shallow, with no depth to the sides. Finally, the edges are knife-sharp and it is only a matter of time until I slice myself open cleaning the damn thing. I prefer my Calphalon and Farber pans to this."
5,"As fry pans go, this is the gold standard.","I had a nice round $100 gift certificate to blow on Amazon, courtesy of the nice folks who raised me on tasty eats. What better way than to reward and encourage my own culinary efforts with the best damn fry pan available to man. Sometimes, you just have to go for top shelf, ya know?This joint had the best price around, on or off site. They delivered it fast too--apparently whirling into action as soon as I'd hit the ""buy it"" button. I received it well-packaged and just in time to try out on some breakfasty type scramble.Voila! I would definitely buy from these folks again. The next time I get a little spending money thrown my way. Thanks M & D!"
4,A fascinating (if watered down) look at a musical genius,"I did not know much about Richard Rodgers when I bought this book. I'm not sure I learned all that much about the man by reading his autobiography. For example, he never discusses his drinking problem or his way with the ladies (unlike the autobiography of Alan Jay Lerner). And he sheds very little insight into his relationships with either Larry Hart or Oscar Hammerstein. In any event, it was still fascinating to read about his musical roots, his work on Broadway and in Hollywood and how some of his greatest successes and failures (a musical about eunuchs?) occurred. I mean, come on! The man wrote the music for Oklahoma, Carousel AND Sound of Music (although he hated 'the book,' as it's called, because it was too sweet.)"
3,Good read but -,Liked the writing and the content but as usual I was suspect about an autobiography with a shade too much wihtewash. This was born out after I read Michael Finestein's treatise on the Gershwins.
5,Works Great,"I have an HP laptop customized HDX16 premium series with vista 64bits and the firewire port that came included doest'n work with my presonus firestudio proyect, make a lot of distortion noise, i was very upset about it for my investment in the customize laptop that doest'n work fine, my main goal was and is to have a movil recording studio or use it for live performances too, but this firewire ADS 1394 expres card "" save the entire show"" ( for me) works with no complain just plug and inmediatly recognize it, im very happy cause the customized laptop runs beautyful with it!!!!p.d sorry for my english...... anyway"
4,alright card thingy,"Product itself is ok but the fact that i put it into a dell is the main reason I encountered problems because it wouldn't work. I mean I got this card for the 1394 jack, but the reason i got this card was because the 1394 port on my dell laptop didnt work or was sharing an irq, wtvr, u sell a pc dell then make it work right!!! Even with the addition of this card I still encountered problems but the problems encountered were from the pc not the card... oh bother."
5,This movie will mess you up for life!!!,"All right, I'll begin by saying that ""Yes! This is the movie from the Metallica video"" Good, now that is out of the way..... This is one of the finest works of cinema you will ever see. The story is along the lines of a train wreck (you can't stop watching no matter how much you want to). It is a beautifully twisted look into the mind of a man whos only remaining sense is touch. Which is not much when you have no arms or legs. The feel of the sun on his skin is the only way he can keep track of time. His memories are his only company. This film will let you see how a man can be trapped in his own body. You will be disturbed, uncomfortable, and the memories of this movie will creep up on you when you're alone in the dark. Enjoy."
5,Good movie,"I first saw this movie in the early 70's. I enjoyed it then, and now I have it in my collection.Thanks"
4,Johnny Got His Gun,"I enjoyed the movie but I could not play this DVD on my blu-ray player like most DVD's. I had to play it on my computer. The story is interesting. I saw the movie when I was a kid and thought it would be nice to see it again. Story is about a soldier who on the last day of the war gets hit buy an incoming shell. With no arms, legs, mouth, nose or ears Johnny lives in a world of darkness and dreams, and reallity also. The movie plays out what Johnny is going trough day by day. Thanks"
2,WAR DOES NOT EXEMPLIFY THE TRIUMPH OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT!! ARGGHHHH!!!!,"The trailer to this film bills it as ''a celebration of the human spirit', a tagline which fails to reflect the true nature of the original book, which, rather than being ''a celebration'' of the human spirit, is, in fact, a denunciation of that spirit's failure, a failure which manifests itself in a tendency towards self-extermination and a desire to perpetuate war."
1,Why can we never find it?,"Dalton Trumbo's novel, Johnny Got His Gun, is one of the best pieces of American writing ever produced, and possibly THE greatest anti-war novel, and yet, somehow, the movie based on this stellar book is never available, ANYWHERE! It is a sin to deprive fans of the late Mr. Trumbo an oppertunity to view his finest work in film form, and I personally think it is a shame the book itself is not more widely read."
1,Why not widescreen?,The correct aspect ration for this film is 1.66 : 1. So why are we stuck with a full screen 1:33 : 1?
3,Decent,"Decent show, but mostly I just wanted to see it because some of it was featured in the video for 'One'. Thanks"
5,Johnny Got His Gun,"I checked this movie out because of Metallica's One video. When I sat down to watch it, I was not disappointed. For a movie about an armless, legless, and faceless character this movie was written and directed perfectly. You can feel every emotion this character is going through. Some people may think this is a slow paced movie but it is a classic that I think everyone should see at least once."
3,"Extract from &#65533;Books on Bosnia&#65533;, London 1999","Essays on Andric and his legacy; two are of more general Bosnian interest. `Bosnian cultural identity in the works of Andric', by Tomislav Longinovic, discusses the elements of `Orientalism' (in the Edward Said sense) in his work; a paper by John Loud discusses Andric's fiercely anti-Ottoman (and anti-Muslim) doctoral dissertation and its echoes in his other writings."
3,Three and out,"When it begins it is all three: Great, Alaska, and a mystery. As Universal often did its arctic scenes of ships, men, and icebergs relies heavily on old stock footage but which actually blend in with and fit the action. But once who the good guys are and the bad guys are and all are rescued from the elements, we find ourselves in an Alaska that is the same old Iverson Ranch in North LA County we have seen over a zillion times and its just another serial. There is a brief relief when our good guys are forced to cut fresh timber for their mine and we have real Alpine scenery and a big logger's truck, but only for a chapter.Baby Boomers and seniors will recognize most of the cast, all excellent, veteran players who crossed over both B movies and big budget films, so the story line and acting are first rate. But the overall effect is greatly reduced by the obvious southern California scenery and sunshine... Alaska it aint."
3,great info--lousy writing,"This is possibly the worst written book I have ever read. It is beautifully produced (particularly for the price), has wonderful illustrations, contains gorgeous paintings and is full of totally invaluable information for anyone wanting to learn wet-on-wet watercolor. The author is quite clearly a top exponent of the technique. Possibly the horrendously verbose and opaque writing is the fault of the translator, possibly not. It seems to have been originally written in Polish. This is not a book for a total beginner as you have to have some knowledge in order to decipher the jargon and puzzle out the obtuse sentences. I am still glad I bought it. It is a deal despite its short comings. If it was re-written in a clear and comprehensible style I would willingly fork out forty or forty-five bucks for it."
2,over priced,Not bad from a strategy standpoint but kinda thrown together with very little production value. I'm pretty sure I could have made a powerpoint ponit presentation as good and stuck Jimmy's name on it and it would be as good. For the money there really is no excuse
2,Not Much Shudder - Not Much Interest,"Except for a few tracks, this didn't hold my attention. I really enjoy Shudder to Think's edgy direction, especially Craig Wedren's vocal gymnastics. But that's missing here, and it's sorely needed."
4,A must,"The movie wasn't much, but the soundtrack's great. It's got a bunch of really cool, unusual songs on it. It's really good at setting a mood. An absolute must for Jeff Buckley and Shudder to Think Fans. ""I Want Someone Badly"" is probably one of the most stunning examples of Jeff Buckley's vocal abilities. His voice was out of this world."
5,Good Read,Alan Axelrod book Nothing to fear: Lessons in Leadership from FDR is a well written book and a great addition to his other leadership books.
5,Nothing to Fear: FDR,"This book has given me a new perspective on FDR. I recommend this to anyone in a leadership role. President Roosevelt is such an inspiring leader and his perseverance through the hardships of the time show how important he was and is to American politics. While I am not a supporter of a welfare or socialist-type state, FDR took the steps necessary to get our country back on its feet. Alan Axelrod has done another wonderful job illustrating an American icon I feel every person in this country should get to know.Maurice Pipkin"
4,yes and No :),"W.E. Vines is on the top of my BEST list.I love his stuff!!However, this dictionary was a disappointment.There are way too many words missing.I am only guessing, but I would say it contains approximately 60% of the total words found in the NT.All of the high profile words are there of-course.But more than half the time I went to this book looking for a word, it was not there.Wish they had completed the work.I love VINE!! :("
5,Classic Early Blues From The 1930s!,The early material that made legends of these men. Bukka White from Parchman Farm and later in Chicago with Washboard Sam. Sleepy John in Memphis with Yank Rachel and Chicago with Hammie Nixon. Good sound from these old records. Highly recommended!
5,Billy Durant,"This is another good book on my hero Mr. William C. Durant the creator of GM. Mr. Durant defiantly affected the early automobile history more than any other one man ever. He was the worlds largest cart maker back in Flint Mi. & went on to save Buick from certain bankruptcy. Also creating GM with Buick as the cornerstone car & then adding Olds, Cadillac & Oakland (the forerunner to Pontiac) & many others that didn't pan out. He also started Chevrolet with his famous Buick race car driver Louis Chevrolet. Some other good reads are The Dream Maker 1979 by Bernard Weisberger and The Deal Maker by Axel Madsen 1999. Also some other really interesting info is the Durant website. Sincerely Lance Haynes President Durant Motors Automobile Club"
5,quality flaxseed oil,I'm a big believer in Omegas and flaxseed oil in particular. I took 4 twice a day while pregnant- No stretch marks and a baby way ahead on his cognitive development. It's also fabulous for your skin in the dry winter months and for digestion. I like this product in particular as it is cold pressed and has received great industry reviews for its quality.
4,Solid History,"This a pretty good historical look at the American Revolution. The use of reenactors is great although some of the wigs are pretty tacky looking. To cover this complex a subject so well in a relatively short time is not an easy task, and by a large they have succeeded."
3,excited,my students now have a better picture of the war. The DVD serves its purpose. The price of the DVD is worth it.
4,"5 stars, but mine was defective","Bought this pot, for I thought it would be ideal for a single. It is. My first pot was defective, in that it was slightly oval, not allowing the lid to fit tight enough. After about four weeks of email with All-clad and receiving a replacement lid , I finally shipped it back (ten bucks out of my pocket), and received a replacement. Perfect.This pot is great for cooking varying quantities due to the slope, and is great for pouring due to the curved lip.I've gradually been changing my cooking gear over to All-clad because of the quality. It's definitely like cooking with the cadilac of cookware: Overall 5 star for the whole set I possess."
1,Not for the 8 year old reader,"Beware, this book is NOT for the 8 year old reader. The story is awful (and boring)! There is foul language and details about reproduction in common language. We read to page 27 and completely abandoned the book! What a waste of paper, and I'm curious if the editors have kids of their own if they thought this was worth publishing."
1,Disappointed,"My family and I all loved the Best Christmas Pagent ever and we enjoyed the Best School Year Ever. We had high hopes for this book, but were very disappointed. The humor was not as funny and there seemed to be alot of it devoted to pregnancies. We did not finish the book so this may only be a partial list of pregnancies: a cousin(whose husband is in jail), the fun, nice, unmarried nieghbor women(who didn't want to bother with a husband),and 2 neighborhood cats."
2,"OK, But very dated","C'mon, Dr. Anthony, You wrote your book in 1983. Haven't you learned anything new since then? Granted, there are some good key points about the public speaking business, but the resources you refer to are all out of date. There are many newer, more current books on this subject. I would not recommend it."
3,Frustrating/Awesome,"This is far from the original version of this book. It gives no information, but from what I was able to gather, it is some old cliffs notes version of the original text. It is loaded with modern notes (many of which are quite inaccurate) that are jumbled in with the original pieces of the story (which are greatly abridged, and who knows how accurate the translation is). There is nothing to separate or distinguish the modern notes from the original story. It's a mess.However, on the good side, if this is the only way to get the story in modern English, the original biography is excellent. Full of excitement and adventure. Bayard was truly a great knight and inspiring man. Worth reading regardless of the modern problems with this edition."
2,abigail VERY light read,"A little disappointing. Writing is definitely ""light"" reading material, not especially well-written. Love scenes over the top, detail detracted from storyline. Could have had a good storyline, but I wouldn't really recommend this book."
5,Epic\Fantasy Metal at it's best,"Dushan Petrossi's Iron Mask...this album kicks ass, It's of corse a concept albumfrom first track to the last I was completely in epic metal heaven, first class vocals by 2 different singers, and Killer guitar riffs and leads by Dushan, highlights are track 7.

5,When Sex Sells It Sells Very Well!,Heller has done a superb job exploring the emergence of super-sexy figures and the ultra-erotic images used in modern advertising.The average grocery store-sold magazine of today has more sex in it than any male magazine sold during the 1960s or 1970s. Why? Because people love sex and they love sexual images.The allure or sexual advertising has become a fixture in the weaving of personal and societal fantasy. And this is one of the reasons why sex is such an effective selling and marketing tool. Heller illuminates the forces behind the drive and explores the mystery behind why sex sells so well.
5,Finally! A textbook for teaching basic KM.,"Ideal for untroducing the principles of Knowledge Management to college students or for corporate KM training programs. Complex concepts like systems thinking, attention management, trust building and social networking are explored in the practical context of real world business issues.A logically organized and easy to read gateway to the exciting new business concept sweeping the nation!"
1,Not a very good textbook,"This is advertized as a textbook, but if it is, it certainly is not on the college level. This might qualify for a high school textbook. It is written on a lower level than the KM for Dummies book!Dont' waste your money. You can get Frappaolo's text on KM for less money and it is a better resource."
3,Amusing tale of a girl who dreamed of being an actress,"I found this book both interesting an surprising. Ms.Gordon lived a life filled with famous actors, globe-trotting and a true love of the theater. Although I don't agree with all of her life choices, her book is a peek at a life lived by few. Unapologetic and footed in reality, the book covers her life from young child until shortly before her death. I imagine it would be a great read for anyone who is especially interested in the theater from the first part of the 20th century. Ms. Gordon rattles off the names of many plays, actors, writers and directors, most of which I didn't know. She doesn't explain much to put them in context, so I think someone who is more familliar with that era would get a greater kick out of it.If youonly know her from ""Harold & Maude"" or ""Where's Pappa?"" check out the long history of this lady of the stage."
5,Some new tricks for old dogs,This video probably has something new for even the most accomplished anglers. I have been fly fishing for over 40 years and picked up some new ideas. The new approaches have been field tested and they work.
3,not non stick anymore!,"we purchased this pan less than a year ago and it has now totally lost its nonstick ability. I spoke to a rep at a kitchen supply store and basically I was told that to keep the non stick going for a long time (usually max of about 10 years), you need to basically cook only omelets. It can't be used for other things at really high heat. I never heard of this before so now my pan is the same as a regular all clad and the non stick does not work. very disappointing."
2,It seemed like a good pan.,"I have owned this pan for a few years and it has gradually lost its non-stick coating. It is now totally useless and I am off to replace it with the Cuisinart pan that America's Test Kitchen preferred over the other non-sticks out there. I love all of my other All Clad products, but from now on I am not spending more than $50 on a non-stick pan."
2,Not as long lasting as I would have hoped,"We received this pan as a wedding gift 18-months ago. Athough it was great initially, it started to lose it's non-stick abilities about 6 months ago, and now is completely useless. I would have expected to get more than 18 months of service out of such an expensive piece of cookware."
1,Good and bad,"Non-stick is very good, construction a tad light but seems to heat evenly nonetheless. Overall a good pan with one huge drawback: the handle is terrible! Thin, hard to grab, feels awful in your hand. Although the lip is designed perfectly for tossing veggies etc, the handle makes manipulating the pan beyond uncomfortable.Would not buy again, based just on handle!"
4,NONSTICK DEGRADES,"I would agree with Resse, I've noticed this degradtion on my pan as well. It's been retired for 'regular' use now. Also, I find the handle very uncomfortable to use when the pan is holding anything that's heavy. Overall one of te best I've owned, but not perfect."
2,Not so great,"I generally love All Clad pans and have 3 of their various size sauce pans and a small, non-stick fry pan. I give them all 5 stars and I like them better than any other brand. The non-stick fry pan is another matter, however. Despite being very careful with this pan, never using it on more than medium heat, always using silicone or plastic utensils, the non-stick surface is terrible and from Day 1 it never seemed very good. My first pan's surface was horrible and broke down after about a year...the store where I bought it replaced it without question per All Clad's warranty, but the replacement one didn't work much better and although the non-stick surface is in good shape, I simply do not like using it, especially for my main use, which is cooking eggs. The eggs stick and clean-up is often quite laborious, not what you would expect from a non-stick pan. Terribly disappointing pan. I now use Swiss Diamond fry pans for eggs, and they are fabulous."
3,Bean counters,"I received my new all clad fry pan and to my dismay I feel that all clad is cheaping out on their products. this is my 2nd nonstick, this pan is lighter which means heat retention is not as good and easier to warp. when asked AC about it, their response is "" People want lighter pans"" BS! Only a matter of time and you will see AC at Walmart. No insult to Walmart. This is me."
2,My wife wanted this brand,This is a replacement. The original pan began to peel so we (she) replaced it. Way too much money!! If I weren't married I would never purchase this pan for this price. I've seen similar pans for less. Much easier to replace a $25.00 pan than a $125.00 pan. And they all cook the same.
2,Not so good,"I only brought the 8"" to try it out before buying anymore and I'm glad I did. I gave it a low rating because anything you cooked in the pan stuck. I bought it for cooking eggs before going to work without using too much oil, butter, etc. I had to use lots of butter or oil for them not to stick. Not what I wanted."
2,childish approach of feng shui,"This book approach the flying stars theorie with a childish way.If somebody knows this theorie, the only thing that derives from this book, is to... forget everything that he knews!If someone does not know the theorie, then he will confused and he does not learn anything."
1,Booring,"This is some strange stuff; nothing practical here. If you are into the esoterica of Feng Shui and know all the mumbo-jumbo, go for it. If you want a practical introduction, or guide to applying Feng Shui, pick something else."
4,Harry Potter-like page turner,"I picked up this book after re-falling in love with Pullman's trilogy 'His Dark Materials' in college. When I first picked up the first book 'a golden compass' in my 3rd grade elementary school book fair, I held the story quite dearly. This book doesn't live up to 'His Dark Materials' trilogy but its a great page turner and a quick read. I highly recommend this book if your looking for a book to share with a younger reader (brother?) or slower reader (boyfriend?) Although it is clearly a children's novel, it offers something for all ages. FYI: It is not necessary to read the first book in the sally lockhart mystery series, before reading this one. This is assuredly a self-contained story."
5,My first book by Philip Pullman- surely it is not the last one!,"I'm truly amazed. The plot is astonishing, and characters are so realistic. I'm really looking forward to read more books by Philip Pullman.I just wonder if kids aged 12 are able to understand all the problems and nuisances in ""The Shadow in the North"". Is this a book for teenagers...?"
3,Seeing the beginnings of a formula,"Though Sally, Fred, Jim, etc. are older, the background remains the same. Pullman uses the same devices as in his previous Lockhart mystery including the use of a set of identical twins. The villians are more sinister and the sacrifices are larger. Hopefully the last book will prove to be more sophisticated than this particular episode."
4,Good book...but for children?,"This is the second book in the Sally Lockhart series. I thoroughly enjoyed The Ruby in the Smoke and I though it was good for my daughter to read about a strong heroine. I am all for ""girl power"" and Sally seemed to be an intelligent young woman. In this book, however, I changed my opinion of it's appropriatness for children. Sally and Fred finally know that they love each other and go discreetly to her bedroom. Next thing we know, she is pregnant. I realize that this happens in real life and in the story, it was very subtle and far from any sort of smut, but I just don't think that it is appropriate reading material for young girls. Can't some things wait? If the story needed to be written this way, it should not have been published and marketed to children."
3,"Ehhhh, it was all right","I really loved The Ruby in the Smoke, so I thought this one would be just as good, it was okay, but I definatly prefer the first one.Here are the reasons:1- There were some lulls in the action where the book got kind of boring and hard to follow. I stopped reading it in the middle and left it for about a week, then went back anf finished it.2- Some things in the plot leave you going "" Huh?"". Like what was the whole thing with the fortune tellers and all? I still don't get what that had to do with the plot.3- The lack of imagination regarding the climax. How is a steam-powered railway gun a "" sinister plot that could subvert all of humanity""??!! Come on! We know you can be more imaginative than that!!4- Some of the stuff is definitly inappropriate and completly uncalled for. Those of you who have already read it know what I mean.So you see, this book was just "" all right"". To really see Phillip Pullman at his best, read the His Dark Materials trilogy! Those are really great!"
1,Too Predictable,"Although I love mystery books, this was not one of my favorites. To me it seemed like all the whole trilogies end in a manner that is so predictable. When I finished reading this I felt as if I was waiting for the actual plot to start! I also think that this book it a bit inappropriate. When other readers say that Sally falls in love with Fredrick, they really mean LOVE. And I am not talking about kissy, kissy. When Sally and Fredrick are alone one night, they have strip naked SEX! AND THEY ARE NOT EVEN MARRIED! I thought that this book was sending the wrong message about sex before marriage, and would not recommend it to any body of slight interest."
4,Fredrick,"I found this the best book out of the series. It was unpredictable, sorrowful, hopeful, and just plain KICK... in the end. Go Sally is what I have to say. And you get a good surprise in the end."
4,I thought this book was a very exiting one!!!!!!!,"There is not many books that I really couldn't put down, but this is one of that caliber. I bought the first one at a store and couldn't find the rest of the series anywhere so I had to buy it over the internet and boy I can't wait for the others. Sally is a character that I can relate to."
1,Small & Bends,"I thought this would be a little bigger, but its a mini kindo-of.I used it once and when I pushed down the handle bent off. Too hard to get dough or fondant out of it and now I have order it again because I need a horizontal cutter. I would not recommend this cutter if you are going to use it alot.Its way too small and actually every FoxRun cutter I have, I have problems with. I threw them all out as they bend up and are poorly made"
3,cute shaped cutter for shortbread,I like when cutters have an open top. Cookie dough is easier to get out that way but the shape is really nice for shortbread.
2,Rivet fell off,"Found a rivet in my food that I found out came from the lid handle. The company does replace the lid but only after you mail it in and wait for 6-8 weeks. Too long for me to wait, since I use this pot to cook rice in and don't have any other replacement in the meantime. Won't buy All-clad again."
5,"INDISPENSABLE, EXPENSIVE, WORTH THE PRICE","I would buy Cuisinart or Sitram for pots larger than the 1 1/2 or 2 qt. saucepans (aluminum or copper disc base rather than full aluminum stainless steel sandwich), but for sauces the small All Clads are great--even heat, easy clean up, and quality USA build."
5,All-Clad: The Quality's There if You Need It,"All-Clad makes quality cookware with professional materials and thoughtful design. The two-quart saucepan is specialized yet versatile (see the Amazon guide which suggests making rice, potatoes, hot chocolate, etc.). The materials and weight ensure even heat distribution, no scorching, relatively easy clean-up, and a cool handle. I am intrigued by the review of the far more economical ""Sur La Table"" brand (surlatable.com), a company which also sells over the internet.In a way, it's alittle like buying a bicycle. You may not need a 28-speed bike, and you may not need the features and specialization of All-Clad. No problem with that. But if you're a serious home chef who knows what you need, All-Clad has the intelligent design features you'll appreciate for a long time."
5,Excellent!,"Like all other All-Clad, superb pan and the 'refurb' model offers a great savings - fast, free shipping from Amazon!"
5,Don't hesitiate! Buy this Whistle!!!,I am a coach and used this same whistle for over 20 years. I have also trained hunting dogs with this whistle.It is by FAR the finest whistle made and worth ever penny.My only suggestion is that you buy 2 or 3 since the only risk is if they stop making these or switch the manufacturing to China or something drastic!
1,Bad Product,Cork inside whistle gets stuck in air hole when you blow to hard. Not usable for marching band. Also took a long time to receive the merchandise and had to enquire about it before it was shipped.
2,Got what we paid for...maybe.,"This trumpet does not have a quality sound. My son's band teacher has attested that it is the trumpet, not the player. All the keys stick - constantly. The marble tops of the first key fell off. The spit valve cork fell off. We have a bottle of gorilla glue handy purposely for this trumpet.I guess we should have known."
1,"Boring, as far as true crime books go","I love mysteries and true crime stories, however I was disappointed with this one. The facts surrounding the case are interesting, but I found myself struggling to finish it...not the page turner I had hoped for."
1,"Bob, stay in New Hampshire","I do not care how long it took Ms. Press to exploit Martha Brailsford, nor does she know anything of the Willows neighborhood (despite her residence which is just barely located on the border of the neighborhood). For the sake of everyone, I hope that there will never be another edition of either ""Counterpoint"" or ""A Scream on the Water"" ever sold or read again."
1,Ditto - not the same as regular Liquid Nails,So sorry this is not the same as the original Liquid Nails! The brown stuff held great! This white stuff is so lame - not at all the same Liquid nails I used to know and love.
2,"For small projects, as opposed to, ""big"" projects.","I thought this glue would be super strong like the Liquid nails stuff used for construction. Only in a small squeezable tube.So it is for ""small project,"" whatever that means, I guess I wouldn't trust it to fix the stairs.I used it for 'small projects:"" It stuck two smooth textured pvc rings (from a 6"" speaker mount) together, and also a sticky-backed velcro to a sanded wood block. The glued joints were left under applied weight over night. The glue proved to be strong but could be pulled apart with determination.This glue is good for semi-permanent bond that does not need to hold weight or to sustain push or pull."
1,Worst glue ever,I'll make this short. This glue sucks. The glue couldn't hold anything together. I gave up on it and through it in the trash.
1,I was dissapointed in this product,"I glued two wood pieces together and 24 hours later I could easily tear them apart. I glued the fabric of a shoe to the rubber where it had come apart. It didn't hold well at all, came apart almost immediately in use. I think they must have changed the formula. Years ago I really liked this product, but now it seems inferior. Contact cement, wood glue, or almost anything else works better in my opinion. Great name, weak product."
5,Worked well for my wall tiles,"I used it to get my wall tiles for a backsplash in my kitchen. It did a beautiful job and they stuck really well. We weren't even able to move the tile if we had a oops--that's how well it stuck. I can't speak for any other product, but it DOES work very well if your wanting something extra to make your wall tiles stick."
3,Preview this book before you hand it over,"As a sexuality educator I was startled by how explicit this book turned out to be, and how uncomfortable it made me and my 13-year-old son. I vastly prefer ""Changing Bodies, Changing Lives"", with more breadth, same frankness, less cheekiness."
1,...,"This book was absolutely inappropriate! The thought that they provide this book to elementary aged children, yes they are children, is absolutely infuriating. This book is filled with graphic pictures that push the lines of decency. Moreover, it is not an objective piece of work. It tells people who believe in rights and wrongs that they are misguided and misinformed. The bottom line is that children should not be allowed to read this book or afforded the opportunity to check out this book."
1,Not recommended for children of any age. Distasteful content,"If you want your child(ren) to grow up believing that 'anything goes' then this book might be for you. However, if you would like them to marry into a loving and lasting relationship creating and loving their own children then this is definitely NOT the book to get for them. Extremely promiscuous language and not recommended."
3,Too visual,"This is informative but WAAAAAYYYY to visual. I mean, you don't want to see a naked boy if you're a girl and vice versa for a boy. It's innappropriate for someone who isn't overly to perverted. Ugh."
1,This is the most inappropriate book I have ever seen.,"If I could rate this book with negative stars, I would. No 9-12 year old should have to be subjected to the disgusting pictures and information in this book. I'm a grown woman, and I couldn't stomach this book. It trivializes sexuality to a cartoon. It teaches 9 year olds how to put on condoms, not to mention the many other subjects that probably would be edited out of this forum. DO NOT ALLOW YOUR CHILDREN TO BE SUBJECTED TO THIS BOOK. IF YOUR SCHOOL USES IT, FIGHT LIKE MAD TO GET RID OF IT."
1,THis reviewer does NOT APPROVE,"I recently bought this book from my book dealer, and as a very, very, very, very religious Mormon, I DO NOT APPROVE. For example, there are full blown nudity pictures of small asian kids, which is very offensive in my book because my husband is half Korean half Happa. And I must include that the misogynistic profile of the obese fat women is very hurty. I was insulted by the constant need for nudity, such as a birthing scene. Why does the woman have to be fully naked?! It is not a necessity!! And children masturbating? God kills a kitten every time children masturbates!However, I found this book quite helpful when I bought it for my children."
1,Too much; too soon,"I did not like this book. I didn't like the very explicit cartoons. The book begins by discussing sexual preferences. A little further, it attempts to describe how an orgasm feels. This is not the place I would want to start from in giving my 9 year old information about her development and sexualilty. I believe that at 9, my daughter needs information about her changing body; not about birth control or sexual preferences. Certainly these (and other) topics are important but they don't need to all come in the same package or at the same time."
1,This book is not for everyone...,"I read the book before deciding not to give it to my grandchildren and I'm so glad I did! I found it extremely graphic, and my experience with children is such that ""looking at the pictures"" can distract from the information an author intends to convey (like buying Playboy for the ""articles""?). Also, the book purported to be value-neutral, but subtly conveyed the idea that although ""some people"" believe that this or that behavior is unacceptable, the behavior is somehow so ""normal"" that one shouldn't be overly concerned about the ""morality"" of it. I chose a different book for my grandchildren."
3,Parental Discretion Advised,Length:: 1:53 MinsParents please be aware that there is a lot of information in this book that MAY not be appropriate for your child. You need to know how mature your child is and what he/she is able to understand. There are illustrations in this book of people having sex and various stages of puberty. The illustrations are very . If you have had conversations with your child about sex and their bodies prior to purchasing this book then this book may be appropriate for your child. Otherwise I suggest that you go to Barnes and Noble and flip through this book before you purchase it online ( because I know it is cheaper online).
5,Very useful and informative.,"This is a great book for parents and can be for children. Its specific information that will make an awkward time easier, however, the text is very dry and may require some translation for younger children. I bought it for my 9 year old and was really impressed, but it needs to be screened because not all the sections are appropriate for any age. As always - work with your child, explain it to them and use this book as your guide."
1,Problematic,"I would seriously caution any parent with a Judaic, Islamic, or Christian worldview to avoid this book. It deals with human sexuality without reference to the institution of marriage, and seeks to establish homosexual relationships as ""Perfectly Normal."" Candid treatments of normal puberty changes and masturbation are interspersed with illustratoins that some parents may consider inappropriate (including two pictures of a man and woman having intercourse in different positions, pictures of a woman's genitalia, and an illustration depicting the difference between a flacid and erect penis). I think a traditional parent would be wise to deal directly with their own children on the topic of sexuality, rather than introduce literature that would undermine their own worldview."
1,And to think this has ties to Girl Scouts!,"It's not perfectly normal to expose our children to a book like this. My children 14 y/o, 12 y/o may be exposed to people with too liberal sexual ideals, but they are NOT interested in these types of visuals. When my children turned 12, I had 'the talk' with them. They both reacted by crying. My boy asked,"" Why do we need to know this stuff if we're supposed to wait until we're married?,"" with tears in his eyes. I never saw images such as those in the book until I was out of high school, and I know perfectly well how to have babies. I choose not to indulge in the other things and would much rather those images had never entered my brain in the first place."
1,It's Perfectly Normal,"I was totally shocked by this book. Ann Landers and Dr. T. Terry Brazelton recommend this book for 10 year olds. I think it is nothing but porn for children. It might be okay for High School Seniors that think they know everything, but not for children. Young children are so impressionable and this could give them just too much information. Why would a 10 year old need to know positions?"
1,i HATE this book,i am actually a kid that has to read this book. it is probably the most embarasing book out there! if u r a parent reading this do not get this book unless u want to embarass ur child! it has info that parents think is good but it gives it in ahorrible way
1,Pornography for Kids,"Parents ought to be skeptical of any book sponsored by the world's largest abortion provider. Please contact your local library and ask to have it removed from the shelves, particularly if it's found in the children's department."
2,dissappointed,"Ordered this large white tiger for my little granddaughter who loves huggable plush animals. When I took it out of the box I was very disappointed to see that, while the body of the animal is ""huggable plush"", the head is not. It's some sort of hard styrofoam-type product covered with fabric. If I had known this before ordering, I would not have bought it. My granddaughter isn't going to like it because the head isn't soft, but rather than pay in excess of $12 for return postage, I'll give it to her for Christmas anyway. (If it weren't for this, I'd be able to give it at four stars because of its size.)"
1,Melissa & Doug White Tiger Plush - Avoid !,Poorly proportioned. Unable to tell that in photograph. Front half is well proportioned. Back half is too small. Item was also crammed into small box so area around tail arrived twisted and crunched up . Will not be purchasing Melissa & Doug plushes again. Ever.
3,Okay at best,"Bought as a gift for a 3 yr old who loved it. It is quite large but disproportionate, with a big head and skinny body. Also, the head is filled with a hard styrofoam form, so not really cuddly."
2,Poor construction.,"Purchased this tiger as a gift. When it arrives, the box is labeled with what's inside! Certainly not suitable for children who can read. When I took the animal out of the box, the seam on the rear leg wasn't sewn, so there was a hole. Returned the item for a new one. The next one arrived and the seam under the neck wasn't sewn - another hole in the animal. It's too bad the construction of these items isn't better. Sending the second one back for a refund."
5,Met expectations 100%,He is a beautiful white tiger of great quality. My daughter really enjoys him and he compliments her room! Definitely recommend this product to everyone!
4,Story telling perfect spot,"Soft and big enough to sit a 7 month baby between the front paws and have a 2 year old cuddled on its side to listen to the best story ever. Can be hugged, sat on, etc... wonderful for sharing moments."
5,Kids loved it,"My kids loved this big stuffed animal. It is huge. Good construction quality, soft fur. I don't really know how to review this product other than to say it was a great Christmas present for small children."
4,White Tiger,"My daughter loves this tiger. It's big! The only thing I didnt like are the front paws, they kind of curve in and don't lay flat. Other than that, it's perfect."
4,Inaccurate Dimensions,"I'm giving in four stars even though I'm returning it.The posted product dimensions (10.5 x 20.1 x 22.8 inches) are inaccurate. The body alone, without legs or tail is 25” long, 22” tall, and 12” wide. With outstretched paws, its 36” long. Since I purchased this as a replacement tiger for my cat (that’s another story) and wanted to keep it on my bed, it is way too big.In general, I am disappointed by the lack of dimensions (or in this case, inaccurate ones) for stuffed animals on Amazon."
1,Pacific Outdoors Optima Snowshoe Binding Problem,We were very disappointed in the snowshoes. The straps kept working loose in the buckles allowing the snowshoes to come off. One had to have another person get down and pull very hard and try to tie a knot around the buckle to make them work. Very frustrating.We have a pair of LL Bean snowshoes and their bindings are very superior to the Pacific Outdoors Optima snowshoes.
5,Day by Day: the Nineties,Love this book. I have purchased the whole series of ' Day by Day ' and thoroughly enjoy being able to see what happened on a specific day years earlier. I just wish there were accounts like these of 2000-2010.
5,Bright Lights,Great pair of headlights make a world of difference on rural back roads able to see deer and other animals a lot easier
2,Poor Quality From India,Mounting ears where crooked which I beleave will result in the bulbs being off center and out of the focal point of the headlights. I compared to other bulbs at the auto parts store and this did not seem to be normal so I returned them without opening them.
3,"Numbers are gold, not so easy to read","I've enjoyed a series of these Timex easy-reader watches over the years, usually having the batteries replaced at least once before a link in the band stretches out or the watch completely dies. I never could see the date--don't know why they bother putting it on. This is the least expensive model I've ever bought. The description didn't say it lights up with the indiglo feature, but it actually does. It's nice looking. The band has more of a shine than the other models. The numbers and the second hand, however, are gold, not black as shown. You have to hold the watch at the right angle in the light to see them at all. Fortunately, the hands are black -- so I can still tell time on this watch--but it is not as easy to read quickly as the black numbers always were."
4,Timex watch 20081,"This is a very attractive and inexpensive watch. Although it is described as having an extra long expansion band, I had to return it because the band was too small. The vendor, Famous Brand Watches, was very kind and helpful about the return. I wouldn't hesitate to order from them again, but would check measurements of watch band first."
1,Don't bother,"The watch was nice to look at, but the winder broke off within 4 days. I ended up throwing the watch out."
3,This is supposed to be a BOOK REVIEW not a POLITICAL VIEW!,"If you don't like a particular book, say so in a respectful and EDUCATED manner. Disrespecting the Author or the Author's associates is childish and does not belong on a website that sells BOOKS! If you have a bone to pick I am sure there's a forum for that where people with like minds can meet, and in your case, bash any author or thinker you choose. No one wants to read this kind of nonsense here."
1,Collection of Pathetic Lies,From a mentally deranged sub-literate conspiracy nut with close ties to nazis and Holocaust Deniers.David Ben ArielToledo Ohio
1,Conspiracist Hogwash and Infantile Blather,"""Save Us from Chamish"" (Australia)Chamish is an umemployed deranged lunatic and a UFO chaser who claims there are giant space aliens behind each hill.His ""theory"" of the Rabin assassination has been thoroughly debunked. Chamish has never produced a single shred of evidence to support his hundreds of mindless conspiracy ""theories"". In addition, Chamish is an official columnist for the neo-nazi RENSE.com web site and has been linked to several other Holocaust Denial and neo-nazi groups and web sites."
2,Not parent or teacher friendly - even if you're a gifted parent & teacher,"I was hoping for a research based plain-speaking guide to helping my own highly gifted son. What I found in this book was a dense theory/research based textbook. As a fairly gifted adult and a high school English teacher, I was able to wade through the verbage, but it was no pleasant task. If you're looking for a textbook, this one is fine, but if you want some real-world advice, keep looking."
4,Helpful Data,"This book contains a wealth of information about numerous studies done on various facets of gifted education. For those who are data driven (and that certainly is the world we are living in these days) they will find a glut of statistics - many usable and even more of them quotable - to back up theories about what is effective for gifted students. For those trying to come up to speed on gifted education, this offers a crash course in the available research, but as with most books of this nature, it's pretty dry."
3,Easy Read,I bought this for a class. It was so easy to read. The chapters are laid out in a very logical way and are short and interesting. All of the information is useful for anyone who works with or has contact with Gifted Children.
5,Sauce Made Easier,All-Clad Stainless is the best around. This large sized saucier pan is great for making sauces and other favorite dishes. Makes a great gift for those chef's you know. Can't go wrong here.
4,Gives real insight into military knife combat,"Even more than the realistic and valuable instruction, I enjoyed the stories out of the mouths and pens of those who had ""been there"" and ""done that"". So much in martial arts is based on conjecture, uninformed assumption, and plain bad information that reality such as this is a breath of fresh air.Believe me - the thug in the street, or the enemy on the battlefield doesn't care that you learned your jumping spinning backhand crane knife technique from the 15th generation hereditary grandmaster of wazzu-fu.

3,the trouble with billy,"The trouble with Billy Collins is that we've seen it all before. Don't get me wrong, he does what he does quite well, but to be honest, I'm tired of what he does. He's a one trick pony. Read the lainard poem and shelf the book. Read his earlier works when he was still fresh and new."
5,"Witty, Sweet, and Dry","Billy Collins has outdone himself. The Trouble with Poetry (brilliantly titled, yes?) will make you laugh, cry, and think. I just read a review criticizing Collins for his lack of complexity. Billy's LANGUAGE is simple, yes, but his poetry is not. It is straighforward, concise, and yet it packs a punch. Upon reading the nine-line poem ""Carry"", I found my eyes welling up, such was the pure emotion captured in those three stanzas. It is hard to read Collins when one is alone- the desire to get up out of your armchair and share your newfound treasures with the world is overhwelming."
5,Great Poetry!,Billy Collins has done it again. He is a master poet. Very entertaining. My high school students love it!
1,Poor quality video,"I received America the Beautiful Blu-ray from Amazon last week and am very disappointed in the video quality. (Note that I have a high quality front projection and high end audio setup and can reliably judge playback quality.) Several of the clips have what seems to be misconvergence, mainly blue outlines on straight lines - reminds me of misconverged CRT TVs. Some of the video is no better than standard definition. The audio quality is much better, but the poor video quality spoils the overall presentation. The subject matter is OK, but I find the video overlay of Ray Charles on top of scenery to be downright distracting. It should have been either/or with cross fades.Bottom line - should have saved my money."
1,live in nashville,I am very disapointed because I thought that brent mason would be the star main player as I adore him immensly.instead i got a bunch of low/medium guitarists & singers.VERY DISSAPOINTED!!! a waste of money.Y.Ben El Lonay.
1,This is the worst griddle I've ever owned,This is the worst griddle I've ever owned. It took me over 2 hours to cook a pound of bacon. 2 hours.2 long agonizing hours. and that was set at 400 degrees . It did not cook evenly. It kept shutting off. You had to keep wiggling the cord to keep the light on & still 2 freakin hours later all I had to show for it was half cooked bacon. So I cleaned the griddle up & I chucked it in the trash. If there was a score I could give that was less then 1 star I would. Black & decker should be ashamed of them selves for selling this crap. You would do better to cook bacon on a hot tin roof then you would on this griddle.
1,Awful,"Uneven heating, shuts off when it shouldn't. Terrible product. I cannot believe Black & Decker allows their name to be slapped on this piece of junk."
1,Awful Product!!!,"Recieved this item for Christmas from my wife to cook for our family of five. Tried it 3 times over the holidays and all 3 times it did what most others have said. It cooks food very unevenly, food sticks to the so called non-stick surface whether you use any kind of non-sticking agent or not and it turns off once it ""thinks"" it hits the right temp that you set it for and and stops cooking the food.Don't waste your money on this!"
1,uneven heating + bad non-stick coating,"I can live with the lack of non-stick by using Pam. But the results are unpredictable due to the uneven heating and useless thermostat. This is a piece of junk, which is why it was last seen in my trash can."
1,Zero,"This one's a zero. I tried it out at my dad's house because I thought of buying one even though I hate non-stick coatings (for griddles I prefer steel). This unit is highly uneven so that pancakes will burn over the heating element while remaining underdone near the center of the griddle. A pancake as small as 4"" diameter will be half cooked and half undone. I could never use this. Because of this, I gave up on griddles entirely and make my pancakes with pans. I use All-Clad 7 1/2"" french skillets (for flipping) on a gas cooktop. If I did get a griddle, I think I'd have to shell out for a thermostatic electric units like the ones over at [...] -- I'm not plugging them. They're just a seller of Wolf, Star and other good griddle brands."
1,piece of garbage,"Within two months, I threw it in the garbage. From day one, everything stuck to it and the nonstick surface has come off. I would never buy this item again."
1,I wish there was a 0 star!!!,"We have had several griddles in our house through the years and never before did we have such a piece of junk. My husband couldn't even keep greasy bacon from sticking to this. It was such a headache we threw it away. Wish we could have returned it, but didn't think to keep the box and receipt."
1,Non-stick needs work...,"We bought this product to replace a smaller Presto unit because of its size and features. However, recipes and food that did not stick to our Presto (even used both units side-by-side in the event it was the food/ingredients!!!) will stick and make a mess on this griddle.If a ""non-stick"" griddle can't handle the simple task of pancakes without sticking like an un-treated, no butter/spray/oil aluminum pan, imagine the huge mess when using the ""family-sized"" surface for hamburgers due to a rain-out on using the charcoal grill outdoors.I have cleaned commerical griddles in resturants that I have worked that were easier to clean than this. Not happy at all, going in the garbage if I can't return it, getting a larger Presto. I hope B&D; changes it, I usually like their products."
1,not what I ordered,"My new griddle did not have the warming tray featured as described. I was very disappointed, the warming tray feature was why I ordered this item."
3,It does the job,We bought a second griddle recently because the cord mysteriously disappeared. There was nothing wrong with the griddle and purchasing a new griddle turned out to be cheaper than replacing the cord. So now we have a spare. It does have hot spots. Bacon cooks more evenly if it is placed around the perimeter instead of in a row. We use our griddle for outdoor cooking when camping in our travel trailer. We've had it for several years and it still works fine.
1,Don't Buy This!,This griddle does not maintain heat and does not heat evenly. I finally got fed up with ruining my kids' pancakes on this thing and threw it in the trash can. Complete waste of money.
1,Don't buy this griddle,"The non-stick suface on this griddle is not non-stick. The heating is very uneven. The griddle gets hot and then shuts off and cools way down, then heats up again. Buy a different brand."
1,Not worth the purchase...,I've had this griddle for approximately a year and my concerns echo everyone else's - Since the first use the griddle has not heated evenly! I use it maybe 3 to 4 times a year and the non-stick surface has ALREADY worn. Back to Presto I go!
1,Worst on the market,"This griddle is the product that made me stop buying anything from Black and Decker. Other reviewers have said it all, but I'll say it again. This griddle heats extremely unevenly, and the heating element will turn off for no reason when the actual surface temperature is far below the number on the dial. My row of pancakes would come out two-toned, with a straight line running down the middle that divided them into the burnt side and the raw side. I guess what I'm trying to say is: don't buy this."
1,Don't waste your money!,"We tried this griddle. It worked just fine ONCE. After that, everything stuck. Pancakes weren't turnable, just made a stuck-on mess. Ditto with sausage, bacon, etc. Pretty bad hot-spots at the edges, cool in the middle. Going to buy another brand ASAP."
1,Worthless,"Same issues as many others here. Non-stick surface sticks and is too easily damaged. Uneven heat. Worst is the design of the controller connection. Worked fine the first few times, but now works only intermittently because the controller loses contact, effectively turning off the heat. Worthless."
1,BEWARE of this griddle!,"I purchased this same griddle at Target. The non-stick surface is NOT non-stick at all. Everything I tried to prepare on it stuck....greasy bacon, eggs, hashbrown, pancakes....you name it. Don't waste your money. This griddle is a piece of junk!!!!!!!! I returned mine to Target for a refund."
1,Awful Product,We bought this at Target because the price was right and our old griddle is wearing out. After one use I returned it!!! If you look on the box the food has stripes from the cooking....if we were paying more attention to the picture when we bought it we would have realized THAT IS HOW THE UNIT COOKS. Every pancake turned out like a black and white cookie....I have never experienced such horrible uneven cooking. We would have expected more from Black & Decker.
1,Worst Purchase Ever,"Epic failure on the part of Black and Decker for marketing-let alone, designing-this product. As a customer, I feel insulted. The heating of the surface is vastly uneven, but the worst feature is the fact that it shuts off randomly every time I use it. Additionally-as per the instruction manual,the item should have included both a warming tray AND drip tray-unfortunately, the box only included the drip tray. One thing that I cannot comment on, however, is the ability of the non-stick surface as I haven't tried using it without cooking spray.By the way, the 5-star ratings are clearly fake based on the content (which is extremely inconsistent with the message of the majority) and the reviewers' records, which are suspiciously lacking. Google ""fake amazon reviews"" so that you can learn how to protect yourself from the deception."
1,Do not buy this you will regret it.,I had a presto griddle for ten years when it finally died I picked up this model because it looked simple. What a mistake the thing is by far the worst purchase I've made in a while. It doesn't heat up properly. My pancakes are half raw half burned. It only gets hot in a circle around the heating element the rest of the thing stays cold. Cant even cook bacon at all. The plastic grease trays both melted after 2 uses and wouldn't stay in after that. After 5 frustrating uses this one went in the trash now ordering a presto which should have done in the first place.
2,Uneven heating,"I've had this for a few years and finally just threw it away. It has several ""hot spots"" and heats very unevenly across the plate. I've never heated it to over 200 degrees (which is almost the lowest setting)."
1,Used 2 times..Threw it away!!!,What a terrible waste of money! I threw it right in the trash after 2 uses! Coating was coming off and griddle doesn't cook evenly! DO NOT BUY would be my recommendation!!
1,So Disappointing !,I received this griddle as a gift. I was so excited to use it for large breakfasts instead of my small stove top pans. The first thing I noticed was the uneven heating. It must have a coil on the upper and lower section of the grill only. When cooking pancakes only the edges cooked well while the center remained light. Basically they turned out rather striped. Bacon seemed to take forever to cook and I had it turned to 400 degress (the max). After only 3 uses it seemed to stop heating. Today I had to remove the hashbrown I was trying to cook and use the stovetop instead. I then put some pancake batter on the grill at 400 degrees and it sat...and sat... until 10 minutes later it was brown. I could touch my hand on the grill without burning it. Either the element has ALREADY burned out or?? Feel horrible but it's hitting the trash. What a waste of someones hard earned money. Believe the other reviews !! Buy a different brand !!
5,A+++++++ griddle,"I don't know what griddle the other people who've reviewed this have been using, but the one I have is excellent, maybe this model's been improved since the other people got theirs. It heats evenly, nothing sticks to it, it's easy to clean and everything cooked on it tastes delicious. I definitely recommend this griddle"
3,Good griddle,"The griddle itself is a nice griddle w/ good size & cooks nicely. I am disappointed b/c I have had 2 shipped to me now that don't have the warming tray included & instead of sending back the second one, I kept it & contacted Black & Decker directly hoping they would just send me a warming tray, but haven't heard anything from them yet. I was also a little disappointed w/ a large nick in the griddle portion of my griddle & a couple on the sides. However, it still cooks well & after going through the return process a couple times, I just wanted a griddle to cook with so I kept this one despite the issues."
3,Decent product but the shipping---not so much,I bought a griddle like this for myself and was fairly happy with it. Does good with pancakes and grilled cheese sandwiches. Decided to get one for a relative for Christmas. The package arrived and I noticed one flap of the box was open but didnt think much of it. A few days later I was asked where the drawers for the griddle were. I suppose now I know why the flap on the box was open. Someone wanted the drawers worse than I did. Overall I would recommend this product.
3,Pancakes for a crowd,"I found a super Black Friday deal for this griddle. After the excitement of the ""steal,"" I went on Amazon to see how good it was. I was surprised at what terrible ratings it got, and held my breath when I used it. To my equal surprise, I enjoyed making 6 pancakes at a time which were evenly cooked. I lightly oiled the surface, with no sticking whatsoever. Clean-up was easy with a sponge......no scrubbing, and no flaking of the surface (as others complained). I'll see how it holds up, but so far it's been useful for the occasional need of feeding a larger crowd. Biggest drawback is the short cord.Feb.2, 2012: I now see the imprint of the heating element on pancakes and ""get"" what others were talking about in their reviews. I would buy a Presto in a heartbeat, and most likely will if I need to use it very much."
1,Stay Away - Only used 4 times and the thermostat control is broke,We bought this griddle last Christmas because of its large size. It was on sale at Target and we thought it would be perfect to augment our Faberware griddle when cooking for a large gathering. The first two time it worked well. The third time we noticed that things were sticking to the non stick surface as others have reported. The fourth time the thermostat control would only function as being off or turned up all the way. This happened when the control was set at only 200 F. It is useless and I wish I could find the receipt before it goes out of warranty and return it.Our Faberware griddle is know 32 years old. We have replaced the thermostat control once and it keeps on working. Unfortunately they no longer make the griddle. It is prpbably the best griddle ever made.
1,Should Be Called Stick Surface,Purchased this griddle after a Hamilton Beach griddle wore out after 10 years. To call the surface non-stick is false advertisement. Rare bacon sticks to this surface even after the top is coated with bacon grease. Don't buy!
1,Piece of Junk,"Worst electric griddle I have ever had. Nonstick surface just doesn't work. Thermostat is way off. There are hot spots and cold spots all over the griddle. One spot is so cold, it just won't cook anything. I am throwing this out and replacing it asap."
1,The non-non-stick griddle,"Too bad I can't give this a ZERO. After one use, one section of the ""non-stick"" felt rough. Soon after that everything stuck. I have used pans and griddles for years and never had one this BAD. Ditto the other reviews--even bacon sticks. I started the bacon on low--it stuck, medium--it stuck, high--it stuck. And I'm tired of serving scrambled pancakes to my family. What TRASH!"
1,Griddle Gripe,"I wish I had read the reviews on this griddle before buying. I too bought mine at Target after my old trusty griddle started to lose alot of the non stick surface. This was after many years of Sunday brunches-well used and loved. The Black and Decker is profoundly inept at basic griddling. My first use was pancakes. With three across the top and three across the bottom, every one of them looked like those black and white cookies you get at a deli-half almost burnt, the other half near done. My second use, just this morning, was for bacon. Set the temp at 250- bacon starts to sizzle up nicely, then all of a sudden, it shuts off! Bacon stops all sizzle and sits there in the grease. Had to keep turning up and then lowering temp just to get the bacon to cook. Meanwhile, made four waffles-one at a time-on my waffle iron-had to keep these in the oven to wait on the bacon! Wish I could return this hunk o junk!"
1,Frustrating,"I thought I was doing something wrong until I read other reviews. EVERYTHING stuck and made a ridiculous-to-remove layer of burnt food. I carefully cleaned the thing and then re-seasoned it only to get the exact same results.Even worse, it heats unevenly. It burns stuff on the edges of the griddle and leave the middle section raw. After a couple of uses, it is going in the trash."
1,Stay Away,"I bought this griddle to replace a Rival that I had for 3 years. This griddle is horrible! Right from day one very uneven cooking, one pancake in the corner never even cooked all the way. And the non-stick surface is worse than my cast iron pan. Had to spray with cooking oil multiple times for one setting of pancakes. I will stay with Rival or Presto next time."
1,Cheap and Useless Grill,"I was very disappointed with the quality of this grill. The non-stick surface is a joke, everything sticks. The grill does not cook evenly. Worst of all, it looks terrible and can't be cleaned. There is a sticky mess from using cooking oil to try to keep anything from sticking, it simply will not clean up. Had I read any reviews, I would have made a better and different choice. The price was reasonable and I loved the large, non-stick cooking surface. I would never recommend this to anyone."
1,"Have owned many grills, this is by far the WORST","We purchased this griddle because the plastic on our last two became brittle and split a leg off, rendering them useless. This griddle did not heat evenly (think: pancakes that strongly resembled black & white cookies). The heating element was so sensitive that it was either too cold at 200 degrees or causing the smoke detector to sound from the extreme heat at just a fraction of a turn above 200. Finally, after one dinner of tacos, a pancake breakfast and a half pound of bacon, the griddle was completely filthy and the burnt grime would not come off of the ""non-stick"" surface no matter what we tried. Thankfully Target accepted a return on the item and we went with a higher end model from a different manufacterer."
1,Ouch - you'll get burned if you buy this grill.,"Have to agree with most of what's been written here. I've had this only a couple of months and it keeps shorting out or something. It heats up, and then you start to cook on it and it goes cold. Have to replug or jiggle or something to get thermostat working properly. Makes meal preparation a pain.I haven't had any problem with the nonstick surface, it cleans quite easily. But the heating mechanism is completely unreliable. I am going to have to replace this. Not recommended."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"This was a gift and the pancakes all half burned and half undercooked. You could actually see where the heating element was from the burn pattern. I called customer service and for 7.50 they would send me a new one. I did not bother, but, they sent it anyway, ok so we give it another chance and this one has the same issue. All directions were followed and results were horrid.I will just go back to making pancakes one at a time for my family of seven, keeping them in the oven to keep them hot so we can all eat together. So very sad."
1,We'll see if the second one is any better...,"I bought this at Target, used it once and had the same problems with uneven heating as other reviewers. I wanted to return it but my efficient husband had already thrown away the receipt and box. I called the customer service number on the instructions and was able to send back the plug along with $7.50 to them and the sent me a new one. I just got it so as soon as I use it I will update this review with the results. I'm not super hopeful."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GRIDDLE!!!!!,"I regret buying this griddle. I was looking for presto but bought this one instead because of the price. It heats unevenly. One half a pancake burned, one half raw. The same with bacon, one half burned, one half raw. I will never buy another black & decker appliance again!"
1,Junk!,I also had uneven heating. Unit turning off in the middle of cooking. Having to jiggle the cord. I threw mine in the trash after a year of light use.
1,What a waste of money.,The first time I used it I could tell the heating wasn't real good because the pancakes took forever to get golden brown. The second time I used it was for bacon which I ended up having to take off the griddle and finishing up on the stove. The griddle ended up in the garbage can.
1,TERRIBLE,I finally threw this griddle in the trash yesterday after months of burt or raw pancakes. I don't know why I kept it as long as I did! I can't think of redeeming quality about it. Look elsewhere for a better griddle.
1,Hot and cold spots,"This is the worst griddle I have ever used in my life. It is incredibly inconsistent in temperature across it surface and will result in food that is either uncooked or burned in the same meal. For example, I tried to cook bacon and found pieces white and undercooked while others, just a few inches away, were black. An argument could be made that you CAN cook on this if you are willing to stand over it and micro manage the meal. I was interested in a griddle that didn't take this level of effort. I wanted a large cooking area with a consistent temperature across its surface. If this is what you want, the Black and Decker is not for you.UPDATE 5/9/2010I just purchased a Presto 07046 Tilt 'n Drain Big Griddle and found it to be everything that the Black and Decker was not. If you are looking for a large cooking area, with a very good non-stick coating and very consistent temp, then purchase that model. The Black and Decker is good for nothing but the scrap heap."
1,Uneven cooking - zebra pancakes!,"This griddle looked promising; well-designed, a nice backsplash, and a warming tray. The warming tray is a little too small to be useful for much. But it actually kept a good temperature - when the griddle was set to 375, the warming tray was a cozy 107. The non-stick surface worked great; pancakes slip right off, if the griddle is coated with a thin coating of cooking oil. But the griddle itself was notoriously uneven. See the customer images for some pancakes cooked at 350 - zebra pancakes! Unless you plan on cooking only meats, steer clear of this griddle."
2,"Works ok, but flakey","I have had two of these units over about 3 years (the second was a warranty replacement of the first). It cooked fine, and I never had trouble with sticking, though I always sprayed with oil before use anyway. My problem was that one of the two contacts that plug into the thermostat went bad and created arcing inside the thermostat. This happened on both units. I'm not a big fan of electrical fires, so would not consider this a safe unit."
1,Avoid this at all cost! Run away!,"If I could give this a negative rating, I would. I have used this griddle for a year - and it has been nothing but a pain. It has never heated evenly, and it has had problems with smoke coming from where you plug in the cord to the appliance. I ordered a replacement cord, and still have the same problem.Trust me - spend your money on a different item."
1,Worthless piece of junk,"This is the most worthless electric griddle I have ever encountered in my life. The FIRST time I used it, for 8 pancakes, it burned 9 and didn't cook the 10th. And where the burned pancakes were, the nonstick coating was damaged. Subsequently, I've reduced the temperature and the cooking time, but for 3 successive days we've had LOUSY pancakes. And I bought it before Christmas because I will have houseguests. I called the 800 number for customer service and the rep was rude to me. I spoke to his supervisor (if it was his supervisor), and she was not much more helpful. Don't buy this grill!!! My previous griddle (Toastmaster) works better, and it's 12 years old. I wish I had looked at the Amazon reviews before I bought it!"
1,Worst piece of equipment i ever bought.,I just bought this griddle. As soon as i brought it home i opened it and turned it on. I preheated the griddle to 350 degrees and i poured some pancake mix.To my surprise i noticed that the mix was flowing to the back of the griddle. I then realized that the griddle has bent and is standing on three legs. I immediately shut down the power and then let the griddle cool down. After a few minutes i noticed that the griddle was straight resting on all four legs.I reheated and noticed that the griddle is bending on heating.This is the worst piece of equipment i have ever purchased. I should have checked the reviews before buying it. Never thought Black and Decker would release such a product. I will return it tomorrow.
1,Dust Collector,"Glad it's not just me. I felt bad for never using this piece of junk as it was a Christmas gift I ASKED for! Very uneven heating surface has caused ALOT of burned pancakes and soggy french toast. The ""non-stick"" surface is a joke! Everything sticks even with some non-stick spray. Thought the large surface area would allow me to actually cook everything at once so I could eat with my family. Guess it's back to cooking in two pans over the stove! Finally got a gift I asked for and it was junk...back to coupons for ""free"" dusting!"
1,too distancing,"I can't get past the fact that the people demonstrating the moves on screen aren't explaining the moves as the go along. Instead, the instructions are given in a voice over. I find this incredibly distancing and can't bring myself to do the workout."
5,long search for DVD version is over!,"I grew very fond of this yoga workout when it came out on VHS years ago. Of all of the yoga programs I have used (both live and on VHS or DVD) this one makes me feel the most relaxed, the most flexible, and the most satisfied when I am done. My only complaints: it is dated--the costumes and style of explaining poses are a tad new-age of the 90's--and it is long. You must commit about an hour of your time to get the full workout."
5,Best Complete Workout,This DVD will give you a great basic and complete workout. The pacing is perfect. I like that many of the postures have an optional pose that is more challenging. I feel wonderful at the end of this routine.
4,Just not quite the right order,"I enjoy this DVD a lot. I don't mind the ""impersonal"" voice some people have commented on. The repetition allows my mind to slip into a sort of thought-free mode where I just focus on the poses. Two things bother me, though:1. The alternate poses are always for ""more flexible"" people, never for those of us who are less flexible. Well, except for suggesting use of a strap for holding hands behind the head. I cannot do the plow pose comfortably, for instance, but no modification is suggested.2. When modifications are suggested, they are presented in the middle or at the end of a particular pose sequence. Yes, after doing the DVD a few times, I now know those suggested modifications and do the ones that work for me, but it would work better if they were given at the very start of a pose or sequence."
3,Almost but not quite......,"I have yet to purchase this bumper replacement though the thought has crossed my mind more than once this paycheck.... the only problem with these kind of deals is compromising the economical aspects with the quality fitment of a no-name kit... this is an obvious clone of the erebuni shogun setup msrp:$1,199 or less depending on who you buy it through. some wholesalers let it go for a little less, i have recently purchased a 91' s13 of my own and have been shopping around for the kit of my dreams... and after comparing and contrasting i wouldn't invest my hopes as a car enthusiast on a kit that might not fit... I'm going with a d-1 erebuni setup"
1,Leather Head Harness,I used this head harness twice and the second time one of the bolts fell out on the side that connects the head piece to the leather strap holding the chain. I wish there wasn't Velcro on the front either because the Velcro broke through a few times when I was using it. There should be a buckle on the front. Not to happy that I had to tighten the screws and fix it already.
3,Leather Head Harness,I purchased this item because the gym that I go to hear on post in Kuwait does not have a single machine to work my neck. I used it the first day I got it. It is very sturdy. I enjoy using this piece of equipment.
1,Not a good manual,"These cars are built by Fuji Heavy Industries, with the same passion that goes into building washing machines. That goes a little way to explain why the writers of this manual had so little interest in putting this book together. Still, we pay good money for this stuff so we should get better. On the positive side, it's quite entertaining to spot the mistakes, and the electrical diagram section is hilarious."
1,Don't Buy a Chilton's Subaru Legacy Manual,"This book has errors of omission and commission. It will contradict itself from one section to the next, and doesn't portray information in a coherent format. I have learned to regard the guidance given in the book with a certain amount of skepticism. Only recommend this book if you absolutely cannot find anything else."
1,very poor,"This book is a waiste of money and is the worst I,ve seen in repair manuals. I have several other Chilton books on fords, chevys, vws and olds and they have been very helpful. But as for the Subaru your better off working on the car blindfolded. I wanted to check my fuel pump the book doesn't tell you where the fuel pump is I had to call the dealer. The illustrations are very generic and too general. I went to re-set the check engin light, the book wasn't even close where to find the main fuse box. The book shows it located under the dash on the left side by your ankle.....Wrong! I tried to replace the PCV valve, again It doesn't tell you where to find it. Bottom line is the book just doesn't show or tell you where to start it assumes you already know. And as for trouble-shooting forget it!"
2,Pretty disappointing,"I bought this book to help with some work I wanted to do on my Girlfriend's FWD Subaru Legacy. I highly recommend finding another book.This book is first, aimed at AWD models, is too broad to cover specifics, and as it is, the pictures are so dark that it's hard to see small pieces. I've done about three minor jobs (replacing the factory rear speakers as they were blown- it didn't even tell you how to take the rear deck apart, drum brakes, and trying to locate the sensor in the gas tank), and all three, the book was worthless, even as a reference point. Aside from basic info, don't count on this book for much, unless you have the exact vehicle they used to illustrate the book."
5,Beautifully done.,"I loved it. The lyrics brings a lot to the ""surface"". Reminds us how much Jesus loves us, one and all if you believe or not."
4,Book for English course,I purchased College Writing Skills. I find this book very helpful for learning how to write college paper.
1,Horrible!,I never recieved my item! I am still waiting on the refund so I can re-order it. I need this book for school and a whole course has passed without me using it. As a result points have been shaved off my grade. This is causing me sooooo much grief. I only gave it a star because Amazon was courteous and prompt with me.
2,Do you like to waste money?,"Calphalon Tri-Ply Stainless 12-Inch Omelet Pan is just as good, However, it is not rated no. 1 by Martha or America's Test Kitchen. I spent $75 on the Calphalon and it is the best pan I've ever enjoyed. My sister in law has the All-Clad, she regrets spending too much after trying mine. I don't put it through the dishwasher, and eggs don't stick if you cook on med.-low."
1,sticky,The first time i cooked with this everything stuck to it. I feel like for the price it should do what it says it does. i do not like this pan and would not recommend it to anyone.
4,Nice!,"My husband wanted the 12"" so i bought it. Love the stainless steal, but a little too heavy for me. I should have gone with the 10"" since i have weak wrists. I'm getting use to cooking things without burning the pan though since i'm not use to stainless pans."
3,Interesting Handle,The shape of the handle takes a bit to get used to.The shiny finish didn't last long. Metal utensils easily scratched the stainless. Directions say not to use metal scouring pads to clean up. So far it has cleaned up nicely without them.
5,All-Clad Stainless 1-Quart Saucepan,"It is a beauty of a saucepan. Everything an All-Clad Stainless pan should be. And with a lid! If I had to search for a down side I'd say it's the rivets inside the pan. Food tends to caught slightly in them. As long as I am careful cleaning it, it's everything I bought it for."
5,Nice Pan,This is a really nice pan exhibiting the typical All-Clad quality. The construction is flawless and the pan provides even heating at low temperatures. While this is an expensive item it's definitely worth the price.
5,Great!,It's small which is perfect for making soup that is 1 serving. I have several All-Clad pans and really like. Just need to careful to not use on high heat because inside of the pans turn a little blue.
4,great pot,this is a very good quality pot but the handle is too long like most all clad pots - they take up too much room on the stove and in the cabinet
3,New pollution CD single,"Well, Nothing special about the ""aphex twin remix"" i think it isn't a good work ,nothing about ""New Pollution"" (you must already know it) but look at ""Electric Music and the Summer People"".It's the original version differing from the well-known one, that you can find in the ""Stray Blues,Collection of B sides"" and in the ""Cold Brains single"",in the sound . A continuous line of distort guitar and the usual electronic madness closing the song, features this strange version.You have to check it up !(...)"
5,Childrens TV use to be great,I use to watch Davey and Goliath when I was little and living in New York. I hadn't seen any of these for 30 years. I found it amazing that I remembered each and every episode just like I did when I was little. It brought back some great memories. I highly recommend this show for your kids (10 and under) or for you if you loved the show when you were little!
3,Enjoyable but short of its potential,"To begin with, as a Christian that grew up in rural Indiana, I am predisposed to like this series. However, I was annoyed, as was another reviewer with the tense shifts within the book and that the tense was different than the first book. The characters are mostly unlikeable and sometimes dull - Bea the organist for example -- SNORE! But, having been the daughter-in-law of a pastor, I can tell you that many of Sam's struggles are very realistic. Why any church would allow a pastor who no longer believes in God to continue in his position for months while he refuses to preach is a stumper however. Okay, so it's not realsim, but that's okay. I found genuinely moving truths here. I also want to know what happens to many of the characters, so I will continue to read. I can recommend the books to anyone who enjoys Karon or james herriott, although they are not nearly as good."
2,Gracie B.,"I began reading this book with the hope that it would provide some comfort and relief from my ""daily troubles."" A great disappointment and waste of time! Many of the characters are so unlikeable that one can hardly finish the page that is being read: selfishness, greed, jealousy, piousness, & the like. There are a few touching experiences in the book, but they are so outnumbered by the negative ones previously mentioned, that I cannot recommend this book to anywone wishing to be uplifted."
5,Another Winner from Philip Gulley,"In this wonderful sequel to Home to Harmony, Sam is beginning his second year as pastor of Harmony Friends Meeting. This sequel, as the first book, follows a year in Harmony. Dale Hinshaw is still getting on Sam's (and everyone else's) nerves and has a new idea for witnessing - scripture eggs. Deena Morrison, owner of Legal Grounds, returns and plays a bigger part as does Wayne Fleming.I enjoyed this book even more than the original. Instead of the vignettes of small-town life that the original had, the sequel follows a more traditional storyline and I found that the characters came even more to life for me in this fashion!"
2,Big disappointment,After Signs and Wonders I was expecting something better. I understand the author wanted to show the downward side of community but the thing was there was little if any true Christian behavior among these people. Certainly there was no leadership from their pastor. I realize he was sort of burned out but it seemed he wasn't in the habit of calling them back from unChristian talk and/or behavior. Disappointing to say the least.
5,great!,"The whole Harmony series is very enjoyable, and it among my favorite in the fiction genre. They are all light-hearted and full of wonderful and entertaining characters. The books follow Sam, a pastor in a small-town Quaker church, and the eclectic group of individuals who are members.You will likely find yourself laughing out loud at the antics of Dale, as he undertakes his scripture-egg project or his salvation balloons. Fern Hampton may drive you nuts, but you'll learn to love her.Many reviewers compared this to the Mitford series, reading this one because they enjoyed the Mitford series so much. I tried reading the series after this one, and found it dry and dull.These books are easy, pleasant and clean reads. Enjoy!"
1,3M trim adhesive,This product was old and outdated. Either it was kept in a high temp area. The adhesive turned to a gel-o like state instead of a liquid.
5,Just awesome,"If you're a pelican freak (like me) or love waterbirds -- or just a good nature story -- get this DVD. Beautiful photography, well-produced, and the story of the pelicans that migrate every decade to the Australian Outback is remarkable -- leaving the question, ""How do the Pellies -know- that conditions are just right for a 1000-mile flight to the interior of the Outback??"" And the images of tens of thousands of large Aussie Pelicans all congregating in the Outback is just stunning. Can't say enough good things, folks -- you won't be disappointed. Lane ""Pelicanista"" Hatcher"
3,"Gators, Dingoes, and 'Roos? Oh My!","These pelicans have a wingspan of 8 feet. They have the longest bills of any bird on the planet. They can eat 4 pounds of fish each day.Think of the title as an oxymoron. The work asks why would a bird that lives near water voyage 1000s of miles in the dry, distant outback. The work keeps you guessing about the answer, but it's easy to hypothesize the reason, really.To a certain extent, I think this work is meant to be like ""The March of the Penguins,"" or to at least to capture that viewing market. These pelicans share egg-warming duties. However, the birds do not mate for life. Further, the older child pelican often kills its younger, weaker sibling.You see a few other Australian animales, like crocodiles, kangaroos, and dingoes. However, I don't recall seeing any koala bears or platypuses. I think the narrator was British. In the least, he didn't sound all Crocodile Dundee like the animal researchers interviewed."
4,Good Product,"I am three years post-bariatric surgery. This product works relatively well. It doesn't COMPLETELY get rid of ALL odors, but it does help tremendously. In all fairness though, I have never taken the maximum dose. I would recommend this to others."
1,didn't work for me,"I ordered this product for my dad to try to reduce the odor of his horrible gas. It did change the smell, but it was no improvement."
2,Capsules instead,So they sent the cps instead of the chewable. I'm trying them anyway. These work for maybe 50% of people from what I am told. The chewable did not work for me so maybe the cap will.
2,I expected something better.,"There were a few times it worked for me, but I had to take several for that to happen. Taking 2-4 in a day didn't work. I have a food intolerance and a bacterial problem in my intestines. Most of the time I tried it, it didn't seem to make any difference in the smell of my gas."
4,Works well,"Item shipped on time. Also, I need to take two tablets before meals for it to work, and it usually takes some time for effect."
5,Excellent product,"Works exactly as advertised. I need to take 4 pills a day. My stinkers are now just winders. ha, ha."
4,Good Common Sense Ideas,"A good primer for new managers with many easy-to-understand management concepts. Enjoyed this in combination withWarriors, Workers, Whiners, & Weasels: Understanding and Using The Four Personality Types To Your Advantagewhich expanded with more specific management practices."
2,Only for beginners,"After reading many other managerial texts, I find this book to be standard and common sense. I would only recommend this book to those who are very knew to management and have not read much on this topic."
2,Not One Of Vale's Better Albums,"Supposedly recorded in 1972, this album is not one of Jerry Vale's better recordings. Some of the songs are re-recordings that shouldn't have happened. His original 60's recordings of ""Too Young"", ""Smile"", ""Mona Lisa"", and ""Pretend"" are 1000 times better than these later up-tempo re-recordings. He sounds uninterested as though he can't wait to finish the recordings so he can go home. He even cracks on a couple of the lower notes. The typical Jerry Vale UMPH is non-existant. I recommend this CD ONLY if you're an avid Jerry Vale fan. Otherwise I recommend ALL of his OTHER CDs."
1,DONT BOTHER,I almost stopped buying Vale cds after this it is just plain awful of course ive always considered Vale to be FANTASTIC SINGER but junk like this or the album entitled till these are just BAAAAAAD.His main problem are the arrangements its always been the arrangements thats always kept him behind both in the industry and pop charts but he is good and ill still buy his albums if IF there good.
5,AMAZING,"This anime was amazing, it is really funny and has a good plot and it even was a little sad too but very good!"
4,Not Bad...,"Well, I was interesting in this series as I had seen a few things about it. It's one of those that really left me a bit down. It's good but I just didn't like the end. We go thru a whole lot of stuff and when you get to the end you just feel let down. I guess I just expected to much. Strangely I would buy it again if anything ever happened to my set. Oh, well....."
5,S-s-s-s-o-o SAD,"I love this show. They need to produce a second season. This show is the ""talk of the town"", lots and lots of people support the making of the second season. This is a buy. Good mix of comedy, tragedy, drama, romance. Ending is extremely extremely sad. Buy if you never seen it.Don't buy if you like a lot of action.Buy if you love comedy.Buy if you like anime.ALSO buy if you want a second season.(Best anime i have ever seen, so far"
5,Simply Outstanding,This series is so much greater than the sum of its parts -- There is simply not enough stars to rate this as highly as I think it should be.It's a fast-paced action/comedy series that takes the time to slow down and get inside the heads and hearts of the characters when needed. The emotional payoff was transcendent by the end.Like nothing I've ever experienced.
5,Simply amazing,"This anime is amazing it starts off slow, by episode five you will be laughing, and in the end you'll cry. If you love comedies like Golden boy or tradities like Saikano get it. One of the few things I've watched over and over."
5,simply amazing,"**this review is about the anime itself not this particular set, will be updated once set comes in!**I don't do many reviews so not very sure on how to structure it really. Found this series on netflix (horror i know) and was almost instantly addicted. I finished the series in one sitting, it is just that good. Like many many people have said before me alot goes on in this series. The characters for the most part are well developed and you get attached to them rather quickly. The amination is beautiful, with what appears to be cgi(ish) eyes which actually work really well. again like many other I wish that the series had been longer but at the same time the ending was almost perfect. overall absolutely going to be purchasing this series on blu-ray."
2,OUCH!!~~~,"THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE TOUGHEST CHALLENGE EVER!!!I WAS NEVER 1 FOR STENUOUS AEROBICS TO BEGIN WITH, BUT IRENTED THIS JUST FOR A LAUGH. THERE IS NO WAY ON EARTH I COULDGET THRU HALF OF THIS! THESE TECHNICS ARE CONSIDERED OUTDATEDNOW. ""GO FOR THE BURN"" IS'NT A HEALTHY APPROACH NOW.SITCK WITH THE LITE AEROBICS/EASY GOING & LESLIE SANSONES!NO JARRING MOTIONS,NO PRETZEL-LIKE MOVES. WHY RISK IT?!"
4,OOHH YESS IT IS A CHALLENGE,"i know what your thinking..your super fit and this is so old, how can it be a challenge? but yesss yess it is!! i DID make it through the whole tape, BUT had a lot of problems because this video requires superr flexibility! and i am NOT flexible at all so i had to skip certian parts. but you can definitly feel it working. the cardio section is short (20 min?) compared to what im used to, but KILLER and really fun. give it a try..you dont have to do the whole thing at once. its an hour long, so i usually just do the first part one day (waist, cardio, grace) and the second part (lower body, abs) another day."
5,Very Challenging!,"The first time I did this workout, I did the entire 90 minutes. Big mistake! So the next time I did it, I tried dividing it up into three segments. Still too tough. Even though I have been working out for about four years, I am not ready for this workout. I am keeping the video for that day when I will be ready for it. It is a great workout for someone in really good physical condition such as a dancer, athlete, etc."
3,Broken,"I got the timer as a gift for my mothers birthday because it was all she wanted. It arrived in three days, actually on her birthday and we were ecstatic.... She opened it and sand went everywhere. The glass was shattered, huge mess. The timer itself would have been great, she said she loved it and opted for an exchange... the company told me they had to send someone from ups to INSPECT the box and it's taking forever...The product itself is great, she loved it. In my opinion, the sand is orange.. more of a neon orange than red."
4,"Good, but it needs to be next to something complimentary.","I'm thinking of buying a cold resin clock off of amazon to put next to this sand timer. I might get another sand timer so I'll have the clock in between the two sand timers. Just a thought for the design weary.The detail on this sand timer is good, and has a rusted look. The dragon detail could be a bit more distinguished, but overall this is a decent item."
2,Broken upon arrival....,Disappointed at first....from the broken glass to the wrong color of the sand. When you order a red sand timer you expect to get red sand....not white....Was gonna ask for another one but ended up keeping it as decor...it doesn't look too bad hah....Anyhoo....the dragons look great it's just a shame mine didn't have the timer nor the sand with it...boo-urns indeed...
2,Don't be in a hurry.,"When the product never arrived I contacted the company who assured me they would look into it with USPS and let me know the outcome (they didn't). At the same time advising me the product was now on backorder and could not be re-shipped. I question whether it was ever sent in the first place and would have appreciated being told its availability was questionable. The projected backorder delivery date came and went and my order fell through the cracks until I gave up and cancelled it. Response to service inquiries seems friendly and prompt, but the products apparently are not, so don't be in a hurry to receive your merchandise."
3,Time is off,Another reviewer said that this is a 5 min timer. The one i have is exactly 3 min 45 sec. so unless some sand got teleported out in shipping there could be a time consistency problem with this product. Although the description and product features do not state a time at all so i believe this is more for decoration then anything.On that note it it does look good sitting on my desk.
2,THE SAND IS ORANGE,"This product is great, but the sand is orange not red. dont let the picture and description fool you. also, the grey is more on the blue side. they should be more honest about the colors. otherwise, if you like those colors than this is for you"
2,"White Sand, 3 Mins","Product is detailed, 6"" tall, but the sand was white, not red. If it matters to you, the time is 3 mins, not exactly 4 1/2 mins."
3,ummm...,the hourglass is nice but.. when i ordered it it was supposed to have red sand.. i got it with white sand and they changed the picture of it.. not to pleased with that..
4,Dinosaur Detectives,"When I read "" On The Right Track "" I was bewitched. The story was about dinosaurs and also it was a detective story.Fenton and Willy were searching about the absent finger of the dinosaur track. They were clever and also they knew very much abaut dinosaurs. So they solved the mystery easily. It was marvellous to read a detective story about dinosaurs. I'll be happy to read B.B. Calhoun's other books about dinosaurs."
1,Not worth it!,"At first I thought it was great, but the stand becomes wobbly and moves while you are driving. I made a sharp turn and the whole thing fell out of the cigarette holder! It evently broke off and hangs on by the wires! Not worth the hassle!!!!!!!!!"
3,Was not the product I was looking for...,While this was not the product I was searching for...I found a gem. Detangles well as I have very long fine hair. Also seems to really help the color not fade in the sun. Does what it states it will and smells good too.
2,Cheap... falling apart right out of the package.,I wouldn't recommend this product. It was falling apart from the moment I opened it. There is a metal ring that is supposed to hold the bellows in place--it was always loose on the one I bought. It's cheap and can be repaired easily. Although why would you want to buy something that you would need to repair right out of the box?
2,All-Clad Stainless Tea Kettle,"I have All-Clad pots and pans, which are substantial and well-made. I assumed this product would be the same. The stainless steel is in fact relatively thin. The removable whistle flimsy, essentially snapping into place by a staple. The lid closes unevenly unless you force it down. Very disappointing. I bought a much less expensive Oxo and have been very pleased."
1,Constant Metal Flecks Make This Kettle a Loser,"I have now had and returned 3 of these kettles b/c the boiled water--and I have boiled 10 (TEN) batches of water in EACH kettle and each time the boiled water contained little silver/grey flecks of metal. It is unbelievable that 3 of these kettles would have the problem and that All-Clad is ""unaware"" of any issues with the kettle. The model that has been shipped was ""Made in China"" and leaves me wondering how All-Clad is overseeing the manufacture of these kettles, and what exactly is going into the boiled water. Steer clear!"
1,Does not whistle,"My old Oxo whistling tea kettle just broke (spring popped out and it stopped whistling) after 4 years of use. So, I bought this All-Clad based on the well-known caliber of its pots and pans. Unfortunately, after one day's use, I am returning it, as it does NOT whistle. Not only does it NOT whistle, but the entire product is flimsier than my Oxo was. The bottom is thin stainless. It's made in China. I think I'll get the Windsor whistling kettle, made in England. Avoid this All-Clad mistake."
2,Does not whistle,I got this kettle to complement my All-Clad stainless set but ended up returning because it did not whistle due to poor lid closure (as described by another reviewer). I was very disappointed by this product because all my other All-Clad pieces perform excellent.
5,All-Clad Teakettle,"This is a sturdy, attractive teakettle. I keep mine on my range at all times. It's easy to clean up and easy to use. It'll turn the heads of your kitchen gadget enthusiat friends!"
5,I love it so far !,"I recieved the kettle today & couldn't wait to try it out.I have many All-Clad items & have been very happy with them.(I use copper core) I wanted one for so long & when I read the reviews I was starting to doubt if I was doing the right thing by ordering it.So far I think I have.The handle stayed super cool.The lid does not sputter(The 3 bumps on lid rim,push down to click in place.) The whistle has a nice sound, not like others I have had, (mostly Revere) not hot to touch either. The only thing I am worried about is how some people said their bottom seams didn't hold up .Time will tell ,but I am hopeful it will be fine .I saved the box & reciept Just in case.It looks great on the stove & I do love it."
1,Don't use for boiling water,"[...]I bought an All-Clad Teakettle to go with the rest of my All-Clad cookware. It's beautiful, but should not be used for boiling water. I am not joking. The boiling water splatters out as I try to pour it and 2 days ago ( I continue to use it because it cost so much!),I wanted a cup of tea. As I was pouring, the entire spout fell off. Luckily I jumped away in time, but boiling water did end up all over my marble floor."
3,Not traditional All-Clad quality,"This kettle is now made in China. It feels thin and cheap, not worth the price."
2,"looks great, too expensive for something poorly designed","I got the kettle to match the pots and pans.Steams leaks past the lid and gets the handle too hot to hold. Since the lid leaks so much the kettle doesn't whistle.When you pour the water, your hand gets burned from the escaping steam. you have to use an oven mitten.Also, the bottom is thin stainless steel soldered to the base. That's even developing corrosion on the inside along the seam.One of the things I've been looking for in a new kettle is one piece extruded stainless or copper material along with a heavier bottom attached on the outside which won't contaminate the inside through decay of an inferior weld or solder joint.I can't see how this passed engineering or research and development. They must have used cold water in it and never boiled it!"
1,NOT CLAD AT ALL: MISLEADING DESCRIPTION HIDES POOR PERFORMANCE,"WE USE A USRANGE PROFESSIONAL STOVE TOP AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DISMAYED AT HOW LONG THIS TEA KETTLE TAKES TO BOIL. THE WHISTLE DOES NOT WHISTLE. STEAM ESCAPES BETWEEN LID AND BODY OR THE LID WEDGES SO HARD IT CAN'T BE REMOVED AND WE FILL THROUGH THE SPOUT.WHEN THE WHISTLE MELTED (MY WIFE TURNED UP THE BURNER HIGHER TO GET IT TO BOIL FASTER) I TOOK IT TO MY WORKSHOP TO GET THE PLASTIC OUT AND DAMAGED THE SPOUT SO, I DECIDED TO FIND OUT WHY IT TAKES SO LONG TO BOIL. ANSWER: THIN STAINLESS BOTTOM - NO ALUMINUM"
2,"All-Clad, what happened?","The teapot has the All-Clad name on it, but the quality is not there. It looks good, but other than that, it was a disappointment to me, really. The metal felt very thin and sounded tinny; not at all like the robust quality cookware I've come to know and admire from All-Clad (I've purchase many other pieces from All-Clad, and they have all been outstanding!) . This teapot just does not measure-up. All-Clad, what happened?"
1,Save your money!,PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO REVIEWERS REPORTING LEAKING FROM THE POUR SPOUT!! WITHIN 6 MONTHS OF THIS PURCHASE THE DANG THING LEAKED LIKE A SIEVE. WHAT A CRUMMY DISAPPOINTMENT. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT...LOOK ELSEWHERE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT IT.
1,Junk,"I love All-Clad generally, but this is not really All-Clad, in my opinion. In spite of All-Clad's proud marketing that it is a US product, this piece is made in China under contract with All-Clad. It looks fine on first glance, but feel it -- it is cheaply made with bad fit and finish. Instead of rivets, it has spot welds. The design is bad as the handle heats with the water and you need a pot holder to pour the water. The whistle on mine did not work. And, I contacted the company twice about it and got no response. Don't waste your money. I will think twice about buying any more All-Clad from a company that does not even provide a courtesy response to two customer complaints."
1,Not for Induction Cooktops,"I also have been migrating to an All-Clad Kitchen with our new Induction cooktop. After purchasing this item, I read in the included product notes that it is NOT RECOMMENDED FOR INDUCTION (MAGNETIC) COOKING. Then please, All-Clad, take it out of your ""Stainless Steel"" product lineup."
2,spout failure,"This is a nice but pricey teakettle. It has one serious design flaw: The spout is spotwelded to the body, and tends to leak. The company is very good about replacements, and I have replaced two of them. The third is now in hand and we will see what happens."
1,Beyond Comedy,"With 20+ years of wildland fire experience: District Crew, Hot Shot, Helitack, Smokejumper & lots of respect for my Structual Cousins, I can only comment on the obvious lack of consideration of facts, clumsy process of experience,& negativistic attitude about people whose life's work are offered to the passionate undertaking of saving lives, property, & revenues of untold value in our natural settings.The only possible excuse I can offer for this ""literature"", if not for the culpability of the author, then an editorial staff, or publisher who stiffed us all!"
1,0 STARS ...NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR TIME,"The author clearly has bitter feelings towards firefighters and this book would be more suitably titled if it was called, ""Why I Hate Firefighters"". The author's own profession is so ""cushy"" that he even has time to contact the reviewers to mock their opinions."
1,Negative read of wildfires,This book gives an unfair view of wildland firefighting. There is an obvious contempt for firefighters.
1,Vendetta,"Four months on the fire line is not long enough to write an accurate description and it showed in this book. Plus it seems that the writer or should I say critic, seems to have a very big resentment toward firefighters. Maybe he always wanted to be a firefighter and was never hired. Maybe he was not welcomed on the fire lines. Whatever the reason the writer took it personally and decided to write a non accurate detail of firefighters and it showed."
1,A very poor read - do not waste your time or $,"Hard to read and poorly done job researching firefighters, their work, lives and impact on society."
1,Don't waste your money,This book was written by Douglas Gantenbein. Mr. Gatenbein lacks any background to qualify him to write this book. The content in the book is a joke! I might give it to my dog to chew on!
1,Full of error - revised,"With a fairly extensive reading history I have to say I do not think I have ever found a book so full of factual errors. These recurrent inaccuracies make this book a difficult read. Certainly there are better picks in this genre. Pyne's ""The year of the fires"" and Taylor's ""Jumping fire"" come to mind. Don't waste your money on this!!!At the request of the author I am revising this review. Mr. Gantenbein has asked me to cite examples of error to wit:I-84 runs east-west and does not travel through MT or WA and is 245 miles from BozemanMSU has no fire science programJane Swift was never governor of MTA Pulaski is a combination hoe(mattock) and axeMissoula is home to R1 headquarters not R6I leave it to others to discuss the Storm King tragedy.Having reread the book I still feel that there are better picks in the genre."
1,There are far better books to read than this one,"The only positive thing I can say about this book is that I feel fortunate not to have spent any money to obtain a copy; on the other hand I feel that the time I spent reading 'A Season of Fire' was time robbed from me forever.Douglas Gantenbein demonstrates in this book and in other writings that he in fact has very little understanding of the true nature of the fire service. My copy of his book was a gift; I'd certainly not have paid money for it myself.If you're looking to read about wildland firefighting, get a copy of Sebastian Junger's 'Fire' instead."
3,More Like a First Draft...,"It is difficult to be the least bit convinced of Mr. Gantenbein's argument for a scaled down approach to firefighting, when his premise is so full of glaring errors: a pulaski as combination hoe and pick; Missoula as the headquarters for Forest Service Region 6. I'm not sure where he got his information on the Storm King Mountain tragedy, but his implication that ground crews were informed of the Red Flag warnings is far from true. He also mentions how fresh the Prineville crew looked after their ""stiff hike in."" They were ferried in by helicopter. This may sound horribly nitpicky, but you cannot be expected to make a convincing argument for anything until you have your most basic facts straight."
1,Poorly written and researched,"I went to high school and was friends with one of the firefighters killed in the 30 mile fire. I find Gantenbein's book to be poorly researched and an affront to the memory of these fallen heroes. Gantenbein has shown through a recent article on MSN that he holds the firefighting profession in disdain and he believes them to be no more than lazy, uneducated slackers who have ""cushy"" jobs and have duped the public into believing they are indispensable. I won't go so far as to say ""don't waste your time,"" but be forewarned the author has an agenda."
5,Great read!,"This book is an entertaining read as well as being quite informative. It grabs your attention in its personal detail about various forest fires in the West, putting it in a different perspective than the sound bites of television news. You feel like you're really there, and what the firefighters may have been feeling. The explanation of the logistics and costs of firefighting were eye-opening. It also gives a good discussion about policy and how we got where we are today, with bigger and hotter fires. I highly recommend this book to anyone who lives in the West, in particular, to discover how our forests have evolved with human intervention and how different they are from area to area, which requires different firefighting efforts. A must-read!"
1,Don't bother.,He has insulted firefighters from every walk of life. His editorial even went so far as to insult the firefighters at the 911 Disaster. He's tired of everyone calling them heroes..do I detect a tad bit of jealousy? Probably has tried to get on a department and couldn't..
1,one star is too much,"Save yourself the time, money and frustration of reading this book.My copy has a permenent place next to my toilet, but its not for reading. Its a little ruff at first but gets the job done. The most expensive toilet paper I have ever bought."
5,blood-rushing!,It was an incredible book of twists and turns.I'm 11 and very picky about books especially these kinds!This book was exciting and when my teacher would say it was time to stop reading I wanted to keep on reading!Buy this book!It's great! Steven J. Antonie (:|||]
2,"Had a lot of good ideas, but didn't come out well at all!",Needs to rewrite it so all his ideas make sense!Maybe the Beast2 will be better.
1,Fulci's worst.,"A black cat goes around murdering the inhabitants of a small village. One of Lucio Fulci's lesser known efforts, this is the worst film of his I've seen to date (The Beyond no longer holds that honor). Boring and suspenseless, this one lacks an interesting story, atmosphere, gore and nudity (well, it has some of the latter, but hardly enough), and typically anything that makes a Fulci film rather entertaining in the first place. Zombie is still Fulci's best work to date and The New York Ripper is a suspenseful and scary (if not too sleazy) giallo; watch those instead."
2,The Black Cat (1981),"""The Black Cat"" is far from the best starting point for a budding Fulci enthusiast, but those who know and love the director's work ought to be pleased with Anchor Bay's extraordinary work here. Completists will buy it sight-unseen, but for more casual fans, ""The Black Cat"" is probably better suited towards a rental, if you're fortunate enough to know of such a horror-savvy shop in your area. 2 stars."
3,This isn't the Fulci film - this is Cozzi's,"People, you are all confusing this film with Fulci's of the same title ... since that film IS available commercially, maybe the previous reviews should be picked up and carried over to its page?"
4,Fulci experiments with old tales with spectacular results,"Most whine this film sucked because it wasn't about zombies or supernatural nuns getting crucified, but this was great. Better than I expected. Don't expect gore, but the death scenes are very creative, a lot like Deep Red's death scenes. Real Fulci fans will enjoy this work."
2,Moderately entertaining Fulci,This film was okay. I liked it a lot better than MANHATTAN BABY. It is basically watchable but reminds me in a way of things like THAT DARN CAT. The cat in question is so obviously trained and is just not really menacing at all. If you are looking for SCARY this is not likely to do much but make you fall asleep.
2,Fulci meets Poe,"Directed by horror master Lucio Fulci (NOT Luigi Cozzi as it says on this site) THE BLACK CAT is unrelated to the old Karloff movie, but is ""freely adapted"" from the Poe story.The plot centres around a black cat (obviously) whose appearance to people soon leads to gruesome fatal ""accidents"" ranging from suffocation and impaling to premature burial. Naturally police are called in to investigate and they seek the help of a psychic, Myers (Patrick MaGee from CLOCKWORK ORANGE). But unknown to them, Myers has a strange power over the cat which enables it to hypnotize people.THE BLACK CAT contains some good shocks for horror fans but the poor English dubbing makes the movie seem daft. The story is also rather slow and pretentious and Pino Donnagio's score is irritating, but the movie is still good late night viewing."
4,Clarification about Il Gatto Nero,"Mishap alert and clarification of the confusion: The poster cover for Anchor Bay's DVD of Lucio Fulci's Il Gatto Nero is a WRONG ONE. I believe it belongs to Luigi Cozzi's film of the same title made in 1989, a completely different movie. (BTW this is why the director for this DVD is listed as Cozzi and not Fulci on this page. It is obviously a mistake traceable to Anchor Bay; there is something to be said for commissioning an original artwork, after all) However, the content of the Anchor Bay edition is unmistakably a Fulci film. Come on, the styles of Cozzi and Fulci are as different from one another as those of Woody Allen and Michael Bay are... it is IMPOSSIBLE to mix these two directors up!"
2,The Black Yawn,"If you can't fall asleep watching this movie then you must be on a cocaine and coffee diet. Fulci fails once again to do anything beyond filming upclose eyeshots of peoples reactions to Casio sounds. Warbeck gives a decent performance as does the guy who got paralysed in A Clockwork Orange, but Fulci must have been planning the other 10 films he released that year, cause this film, like most of Fulci's, lacks any direction outside the aforementioned ""suspense shots."" Rent it if you must."
2,This is Fulci-Lite,"It appears that Fulci did not spend a lot of time or effort in producing this retelling of the classic tale of ""The Black Cat"", as it seems shallow and hurried. The story involves a pretty young photographer who gets caught up in murders in a tiny English village, which may or may not be traceable to mad Patrick Magee and his pet cat. Hmmm...There is a severe absence of trademark gore scenes here, which is why ""The Black Cat"" never features much in Fulci filmographies. The only really unpleasant scene is the one in which Dagmar Lassander is burned alive, with plenty of close-ups. The English village is all very beautifully shot, and it appears to be on location, but in every scene of tension, Fulci reacts by zooming in on the eyes of the characters, (and of the cat!) Afer scene upon scene of close-ups of eyes, you will be praying for the cat to come and rip yours out! This film came after Fulci's period of greatness, and is nothing more than a stop gap."
2,It's Just Common Sense!!!,"This book was a disappointement for me, yes, I does give some useful insights into networking and what it is all about. However, most of the chapters are based on common sense that you would do anyway (I hope!!) such as being polite and striking up conservations with people and being nice to everybody regardless of class.It doesn't give much insight either how to approach contacts at later dates once you have established informal relationships.If i had to say the one thing i learned the most from this book was to carry business cards where ever i go, they are the golden key to networking."
4,If you've tried networking without much success...,"... then try this book! There are no cheesy gimmicks here, just simple and sound advice on how to bring people you meet into your fold by asking, ""What can I do for this person?"" rather than ""What can they do for me?"".Even experienced networkers could learn something valuable from this book."
5,positive life networking,"I am a critical care nurse, networking is not really a part of my job, but when I read ""The Frog and Prince"" I realized how positive networking is a ""life skill"", a skill one can never know or practice too much. The attitude and energy of ""What can I do for you"" is life affirming for both the giver and receiver.This book has helped me to take my skills as a nurse-healer into all facets of my life whether I be at a party, meeting or on a bus. Thanks to Darcy, Gayle and Judy for such great information provided in such a palatable form."
1,OLD OLD OLD INFO,Old Out dated Information It might be fun to flip through the book for a few laughs about the past.
2,Very Mixed Bag....,"Spinning off of the premise of the horror classic ""Night of the Living Dead"", Bogus Dead presents a few dozen similarly-themed short stories by some of the brightest lights in Indy Comics. Some of the stories work quite well, most don't work at all. I found the book to be a torturous read, and the handful of truly inspired stories aren't enough to earn a recommendation. Give it a quick skim before buying to see if it's your cup of tea. I was very disappointed....."
5,An excellent Read,"I bought this book at the recomendation of a Truax Family member. Our ancestry goes back to Philippe de Treaux who was one of the original settlers of New Amsterdam around 1640. In the book (on page 200) he is identified as Philip de Truy, ""court messanger."" He was mentioned in the book but was a minor player in the administration of the early government. I enjoy reading history so it was a book I truly enjoyed. I have recomented it to many Truax family members.Pete Truax"
5,The Island at the center of the world,Fascinating historical text that puts the Dutch heritage in North America back on the map.
4,Very good,"This book is a surprisingly good history of the short-lived North-American Dutch colony of New Netherland. In particular, the author sets out to show how many ""American"" traits were actually first imprinted on the land by the Dutch, as they set out to create a dynamic and tolerant society.This is a very good book, the author does a very good job of presenting the history of New Netherland, and does a very good job of arguing his case for how much present Americans owe to these Dutch forebears. I really enjoyed the time I spent reading this book, and I highly recommend it to you.(Review of The Island at the Center of the World by Russell Shorto)"
5,Intolerably small font size in this paperback edition of this fantastic book,"DO NOT BUY THIS PAPER BACK edition.The Island at the Center of the World: The Epic Story of Dutch Manhattan and the Forgotten Colony That Shaped America. Its font size is intolerably small. Go for a used hard back or some alternative to avoid eyestrain or impossible to read small print.The book is a well-written account of the not-very-well-known predecessor colony to New York. New Amsterdam and its contributions to our culture, diversity, tolerance, and institutions is both interesting and informative. Shorto makes it come alive with vivid prose and characters."
3,"Interesing, but dry","I thought this history of New Netherlands was very interesting, coming from a perspective of someone who has not read a lot about that time period. I did stay interested in the book, but it moved too slow for me, taking time on details that weren't really pertinent to the subject matter. You could tell that the author was passionate about his subject, and that shone through enough to make the book worth reading."
2,Good Story Poorly Told,"What a missed opportunity! With the use of recently revealed material Shorto, with much publicity, presents us with what is billed as a new and exciting history of early Dutch settlement in America. The main problem is that it is not popular history, but historical fiction. In an effort to create a narrative story, Shorto informs us of dialogue, weather, the color of the sky, and specifics of peoples' clothes in specific circumstances throughout, information totally a creation of the author's imagination. One is tempted to say that the work is direly in need of an editor to clean up the mis-spellings, incorrect use of pronouns, clumsy repetitions, etc., but even that would not solve the main problem with this book: the author has taken new and fascinating information and made it boring.My only hope is that there is room for another effort to present this material to us, one which does justice to the material and our intelligence. This book does neither."
5,This one hooked me,"I've long been intrigued by how the events, planned & random, of the past can be linked directly, step by step, to the present day. The unique circumstances of the founding and growth of Manhattan provided the continuing unique trajectory through time. A city I once had little interest in visiting, New York City is now at the top of my list for a lengthy vacation."
3,Interesting and forgotten,"This book tells the early history of New York, or as it was originally called...New Amsterdam. Details are revealed regarding Hudson's discovery of the island for the Dutch, the first settlers on the island, and the eventual take over of the city by the English.I was very interesting to find out how diverse and tolerant the city was. The interaction between the settlers and the natives was enlightening, as well as, the Dutch names that have lived on after the settlement became English.Shorto draws information from Dutch records that have survived the centuries and are now being translated. However, Shorto isn't a historian and I wonder if this story could have been better handled by someone else.I did enjoy the book, and would recommend it to enthusiasts of New York city history."
2,The writing style wore me out,"I'm so interested in the story told in this book, but the breathless (a la DaVinci Code) writing style wore me out. It was a struggle to finish."
2,A Big Disappointment,"My family made it through 3 audiocassettes of this book before giving up in irritation and disappointment. Though some very interesting material is covered, the book suffers from padding, inadequate editing, and is also tendentious - with a dull and predictable repetition of diversity themes and a corresponding hostility to organized religion.Shorto is no Barbara Tuchman, thats for sure."
4,New Amsterdam revisited,"I loved this book because it has a developing historical story of the origins of Manhattan and the conflicts going on at the time on a small island on the other side of the world that only inhabited about 2,000 people. Having found that my ancestor was one of them, I researched this time period to find out more about what life must have been like back then. Although my ancestor was not mentioned in the book, it created a real vision of what life was like during that time period. I enjoyed it so much I also bought it on CD to listen to over and over again."
3,Too much information,"I read this book for a book discussion group. I was born and raised in NYC so I found where some of the New York names had come from to be very interesting. I don't think I would have finished the book if I weren't a New Yorker. Many people in my group in fact, did not finish the book.There were too many facts and names to keep track of and therefore hard to folloow."
2,"Interesting idea for a book, poor follow through",I don't know if this person is just a bad author or if or if they just can't write this type of book but this book is horrible. I'm not quite done it yet and I don't know if I'll bother finishing. While this is a story that needs to be told it deserves a better person to do so.
5,Great book on New Amsterdam,"Shorto does a great job of bringing the men and women of New Amsterdam to life with his humor and his imagination. By the end, we feel we know them all -- from the movers and shakers like Van Der Donck and Stuyvesant, to the unremembered scribe whose tears -- or wine? or simply water? stain the colony's records. The book is damaged, unfortunately, by Shorto's dislike of the Puritans, and perhaps he would rethink his thesis that American liberties were birthed by the Dutch if he were more familiar with the history of English liberties. Still, this book is a must-read."
3,Break-up to make up read.,"Annie Burton gets upset when her husband forgets important dates, so upset that she ends her marriage because he forgets their sixteenth wedding anniversary. She believes Sam no longer loves her. Filled with confusion and misunderstanding, Annie and Sam struggle through their difficulties under the watchful eye of the prying community in which they live. A basket of chocolate, a bouquet of flowers, and a box from a jeweler could have prevented their break-up, and this knowledge gives a superficial quality to the couple's romance. Evanick gives a hard-edged, mainstream slant to this stereotypical tale. Steeped in old-fashioned, childish expectations, this story will touch the hearts of those who can relate to the emotional instability of an insecure woman thwarted."
2,"It was cool in the '80s, not so in the '00s","I loved listening to this Album when it was on LP because I was a campy 22 year old. Now that I am a still campy 42 year old, this CD is not as cool.I am no longer feeling it beyond ""My Secret Place"" and ""Number One"" (which were the first two tracks)."
2,Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm ~Joni Mitchell,"This is not one of the strongest albums Joni Mitchell has released. The are a lot of guest vocalists and they don't always match with Joni's voice or songwriting. The lyrics are ok as well as Joni's voice, but the synths sound so dated by now. Most of the songs suffer from that. There are a lot of albums who have a distinct 80's sound but this one hasn't hold up that good. I own all of Joni's albums and hate to talk bad about her but this album is not one of my favourites. There is only one song on this album that is really good, the closer A Bird That Whistles. A simple acoustic track with saxophone from Wayne Shorter. The photography on the cover is beautiful as well. So, not one of her best but she has made so many exellent albums that this one pales compared to those."
1,The dull 80's,I discovered Joni this summer by chance listening to Mingus and Hejira and then I backed up to her early CD's and started buying them one by one. I was having a great time (Blue is just outstanding) and looked forward to each CD until I reached Wild Things Run Fast. Dog Eat Dog isn't much better and Chalk Mark is unfortunately probably the worst of all of her CD's - very dissapointing. There is a duet with Billy Idol on this CD which is one of the worst duo performaces of all time. I don't know who talked Joni into this CD but it was a huge mistake.
1,1 track makes the disc worth the price.,"I was disappointed in the sameness of most of the tunes on this recording. ""Cool Water,"" however, with Ms. Mitchell and Willie Nelson made the purchase well worth the price. This creative and imaginitive arrangement will probably never be matched. It kind of makes one wish for an avant garde Sons of the Pioneers singing group."
2,Non-original tracks better,"Like that '80s depth of field, enjoy the synthesizer when it's used sparingly and tastefully, as it is here. Funny that the '80s now sounds more dated than some of the music Joni references from the past, a cool cover of ""Cool Water"", plus a few other songs recalling ""Johnny Angel"" and ""Corrina, Corrina"" (Mitchell's gotta be thinkin' 'bout Big Joe's version, yeah...).Opening song, ""My Special Place"", is pretty okay - sounds like the theme to an unsold 1987 TV pilot about a coffee shop run by two 36 year old divorced feminists.Once again, her lyrics stand alone as poetry - and there isn't, and never was, a whole lot of rock and rollers who could seriously sell their words separate from their music. And this keeps Chalk in a Rainstorm on the home carousel."
4,Joni Reaches Out,"This is one of my favorite of Joni's easily accessible albums, and probably my favorite of her more recent albums. Some of her albums, such as Mingus, I personally enjoy very much but they are clearly not meant for a broad audience. In this one, she reaches out and comes up with some catchy tunes, pleasing harmonies, some relatively exciting beats. I'm not quite sure why this album is not more popular. I can see why some of her more recent albums have not grabbed the public's attention, but this one seems to me to be the kind of thing that many people could enjoy. This is not a five star Joni album, such as Blue, or Hejeira, but if you enjoy her music at all, I would imagine you would find this one appealing."
4,Canon MP24DV,"I like the calculator. The picture was exactly what I had, this is why I ordered it. But it is not what you get. The new one is silver and the buttons on the left are different. The clear/cancel button is in a different location and is taking time to get used to. Other than that, it is a good calculator."
1,Piece of JUNK,"I bought this calculator about a year ago or so and had problems with it from the beginning. I hit the plus, and it ""pluses"" 2 or 3 times. doesn't total. enters the wrong numbers, numbers get stuck. Now it is completely DEAD. The plus button doesn't seem to work at all. If you enter 55 plus 45, you get an entry 5545.This machine was NOT cheap and I expected a heavy duty reliable calculator. NOT! Before this, I considered Canon to be a reliable brand name & I was considering buying a camera. This adding machine is just POORLY made from the get go. Don't buy it."
1,Good Show - Bad DVD's,I was really enjoying my Farscape set until...Really good Sci-Fi Series though too bad that the DVD's are such bad quality anymore as everything else in the world.Now I have to exchange it; can't return it since all of us are video pirates. I AM NOT BUYING ANYMORE DVD'S!!! They're either made in CHINA or made here with made in CHINA DVD's by underpaid people who can't speak English. Either way it's all CRAP!We'll have to wait until after WW-III before we can get anything good again.
5,Excellent product,"Works as advertised, fast, easy and the case is pretty solid (seems like it would be pretty tough to break. I've had great success with Linksys products overall - continued here."
2,"Chicago Blues Session.V23, my review from Barcelona. Great music but very bad recording","Two big monster of the Blues like guitarist Eddy Clearwater and harmonica Carey Bell don't deserve this very poor sound in this recording. I'ts a surprise for me this very bad sound recording because the important WOLF RECORDS with a marvelous Blues catalog enjoy normally of very good sound all their records.About musics it is not necessary to say something concerning to them, they are great Bluesman two of the best.Another thing is about songs, apart from the sound, the two Blues-Rock songs ""I Wouldn't Lay My Guitar Down"" and ""Jump Back Jack"" are a little loud and monotonous, the remainder you can consider they are very good specially ""I'm Gonna Move"", ""Last Night"" and ""One Day"",also beacuse this three Blues are very good Blues per se, I insist on apart from a bad sound. I like very much the large Clearwater and Bell discography but to this Wolf record I only can grant 2,5 stars basically by its bad sound."
5,Even better than the 6 quart!,"When purchasing our original All-Clad cookware, we explicitly went for the 6-qt Dutch oven/stockpot, since we are a family of two. While the 6-qt has served us well for several years, I discovered I'd need the slightly greater volume when making some fruit preserves this summer. So I bought the 8-qt.It's been a joy to own and use. Unlike the 6-qt, whose handles get a mite warm after long stove-top cooking, the 8-qt handles rarely get hot, even after cooking on a gas range for a couple of hours. I don't regret our original purchase decision, but I do like the 8-qt version a bit better than the 6-qt now."
4,"The best quality, but consider the MC2 line","As with all of All-Clad's products, this stockpot impresses me with it's quality but because I don't use it as much as I would like, I feel like I wasted some money on a line that I could've gotten at a cheaper price.I think the external finishes of the Stainless line is more durable than the MC2 line, but I don't think by that much for most people to spot easily. With that, I recommend most people buy the MC2 line because it will cook just as well as comparable Stainless products but a cheaper price.I would hate to sound cheap, but I think most people would be better off with the MC2 line."
4,all clad pot,I was glad to get this pot as it is the last one to my set. Unfortunately the company has changed their all stainless line and I don't think its as good of quality. This pot is outstanding!
4,ESCAPISM...L.A. STYLE,"This book highlights one of the unique qualities of Los Angeles. Much of L.A. housing has a Mediteranian feel, not surprising given the climate of southern california and the foothills and mountains and the courtyard is a prefect oasis to build this style of house around. This book does a wonderful job of showcasing these beautiful courtyards and the text and the images are very well presented. Reading this book reminds me of why i love Los Angeles so much, I mean even with all of her problems, she can be so serine and beautiful. Highly recommended."
3,It IS a Remarkable Book,"I happened upon this book in a very small Taipei bookstore. The number of contemporary books written in English was extremely limited and the selection was rather poor. But there was Sexus - and who hasn't heard of Henry Miller? I had never read a work by Miller. Intrigued, I took the book and read Sexus on the flight back to the States. I recommend the book to anyone with a strong curosity, a liking for frankly sexual material, and a most unique view of the world. I did not ""love"" the book, but I did find it intelllectually provocative, though definitely not sensuous. I am not particularly interested in reading Miller's other works, but I am glad I happened across this book in such an unlikely place and experienced the fasinating literary world of Mr. Miller. Not a fun book, at least for me, but everyone ought to give him a try once"
1,Meandering drivel,"I couldn't go beyond page 20. Where's the plot? Miller wants to muse about a philosophical view that's more neurotic than sane. Who cares? The sex? Anybody can write scenes like that. They're there to break the monotony, I guess. His protagonist is not somebody I admire and care about. He admits he's a loser. No thanks. There are good books out there waiting to be read and enjoyed."
1,Abuse labeled art,"It is quite obvious to any woman reader that Henry Miller is a bad lover...of the poorest quality, and that he has no respect for women or even men, for that matter. What a waste of talent. I truly wish I'd read Tropic of Cancer first, because I will never touch another of Miller's books. My intellect and libido are stimulated in other ways."
1,Self-indulgent garbage .,This book is not fit to read unless your so inmature you need someone elce to do your sexual fanticies for you.
4,One of a kind,"It was the first time i encountered such a daring attitude of a writer. I recognized from the very beginnig that this book would be different. Miller gives e hard blow to the hipocrisy and fake moral standards set up by the society. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to see the real way of life, and try to adapt himself to a new lifestyle where he is in control of his life."
3,Who Am I to Critique Henry Miller?,"Okay, Henry Miller is one of the guys in my Encyclopedia of Great Writers. That's why I ordered the book. Everybody who reads knows about Henry Miller, so I decided to stick my toe in the unknown waters. He's a great writer. The excursions into his mind and his observations are inspired. I think this would be a better book if Mr. Miller had his mind on something other than his ... well, let's leave it at that."
1,An eclectic gathering of papers on dynamic systems,"Langton pulls together a number of interesting papers from the Los Alamos a-life conference, bound with the perspective only he can provide. Great for the technically-minded curious but most promising as storehouse of ideas for experimentors in dynamic adaptive systems."
4,An important scholarly book,"This has become one of the essential texts in understanding music of the Classic Era. Webster is one of the leading scholars of 18th-century music and particularly of Joseph Haydn. It is not for the non-musician, as the analyses are quite extensive, but for those who can follow Webster's work, it is well worth the effort and repays study. I recommend this highly."
4,Montealto Naturalizer Sandal,"Very comfortable, I can walk long distances in these sandals. The one drawback is that they are a bit too loose and there isn't much adjustment possible. I normally wear a 9.5/10 medium width."
3,Neat little book but too expensive!,"It's a wonderful little piece, but a teeny little book for $40 bucks?! What's more, most of contents are/were actualy available at Krugman's own web site. Someone's sure making a lot of unearned money here off..... If money were no object, though, I'd surely rate this book much higher."
4,Accurate and as expected,"Well, it is a stainless lid, that fits small All-Clad saucepans. Performance is not an issue, really- the only things wrong with it are common to all All-Clad lids (must lift to see food cooking, flat rim around edge is easily dinged and compromises seal with pan.) Also, the c.$30 for a little circle of metal is hard to swallow, but then, we must not mind too much because we are buying these products no matter how much they cost!"
4,Simplemente Irresistible!,"Compré este libro y no pude dejar de leerlo hasta la última página. Es una novela de misterio, romance y mucha tensión. El único problema que tiene es que a la mitad del libro ya han aparecido tantos personajes que tienes que devolverte un poco a ver quién era quién. La historia es fascinante, el estilo narrativo es muy bueno y el lenguaje utilizado es muy accesible. Ampliamente recomendado."
4,"A ""Must Own"" Album for any Gershwin fan","I do *not* agree at all with the one-star review currently displayed. This is a great album of Gershwin music performed by some of the greatest artists of the last 50+ years. The sound quality is also excellent. As far as I'm concerned, this is a ""must own"" album for any Gershwin fan."
1,loaded with spices,These pills taste more like oregano than garlic though it is allegedly 440mg garlic and 150 oregano.. and are not enteric gelcaps like I prefer for garlic intake. you might start burping after taking them. Going to go toss this in the trash now by the way.
5,All Clad lid,"I bought a demo all clad copper core pot and needed a lid to go with it. This seller provided an authentic all clad lid at a fair price and in an expedient manner, pleasant transaction."
3,NOT for the pan,"I measured my frying pan and thought sure this was the right lid, but what I needed was to 10-incher. This is for some kind of pot or something."
3,Does the job,"The price was right, but I'm not happy about the fact that the lid was made in China. The handle is different but it does fit fine. I would have paid more for a US made lid the same as what I had. Shipping was quick, & the item was well packaged."
1,Not as good as the first.,"The first track, Titanic Suite, was too long and compressed what was on the first soundtrack. Although there were a couple of other songs that were good. It was finally good to hear the Irish songs. The songs with the movie clips....the music would have been much better if the clips were left out. I'd say all in all it was disappointing. I do like the movie and the first soundtrack, but this one really misses the mark."
2,BORING,This cd is really boring & the dialogue is unbearable. The music is pretty much the same as the first one. The only worthwhile tracks are the 3rd class party & 'nearer my god to thee' which were sinfully omitted form the first cd. Get your head examined before you buy this cd
2,Is this trip really necessary?,"First comes the sinking of the ship, now this flotsam and jetsam. A disappointing rehash of all that has come before. STILL no liner notes about the music or its composition, and a silly redux of the Celine Dion song with some of the movie's more inane dialouge cobbled in. The compilation suites are enjoyable, and the Irish music interesting--there's nothing wrong with any of the performances, just a general sense of been there, done that. (And my GOD! Even the poor passengers on the ill-fated liner only had to listen to ""Nearer My God to Thee"" once!)"
5,Better than the first,"I think everything on this soundtrack is superb, but the dialogue was hard to get used at first."
4,Wonderful... for the most part...,"This soundtrack is wonderful because it has all of the music that the movie soundtrack didn't. In addition, these are all the songs I was looking for but could not find in the movie soundtrack, the songs that give the true ""feelings"" of Titanic. Also, James Horner is a magnificent artist and I suggest looking into his other soundtracks.However, there is one downfall, which I don't know if theres a similar soundtrack that comes without it, but the voices of the characters are distracting to the music and I feel should not have been put in it. During most of the songs, characters such as Jack and Rose say some of their lines."
5,Great Movie! The soundtract has to be like it!,I the movie is that great then this soundtract sounds wonderfull
3,Doesn't live up to expectations,"I was disappointed with this release. I had expected that this CD would be much different than it actually was. I found that the ""My Heart Will Go On Song"" to be different than the one I had otherwise heard. The dialogues didn't seem to fit in where they were stuck in. Overall, it is a much better investment of your money in the first ""Titanic"" soundtrack rather than muddle through this. More songs on the first one, plus a better interpetation of ""My Heart Will Go On"""
3,Good for Fanatics,"This is an elegant compilation of James Horner's music from the film Titanic; however, it was not meant to be the primary score. Titanic fans who couldn't get enough out of the original score drove Horner to produce Back to Titanic. The songs are beautiful, the use of the orchestra is brilliant, but the songs are not orthodox-Titanic. Probably two or three tracks actually were derived from the film--the rest sound like fillers. I recommend this album to Horner/diehard Titanic fans, but if you're just seeking the Titanic music, settle for the original."
5,Great music from a great film,"I purchased this cd mainly for the wonderful tune played on the piano, ""The Portrait,"" and I was pleased to realize that the other songs were just as fabulous. If you enjoyed the movie, then this is a great piece to own."
3,Containing one Major flaw on a otherwise excellent CD.,"The Major Flaw is the song that should never have been produced to start with, the dialouge version of the main love theme. If it were not for this mistake production, this CD would have much better ratings. Expect for that the CD contains excellent music such as the paino suite and thrid class dance."
5,Fantasic!!! It's the Missing Link!,This was all the music I wished had been on the original soundtrack. Loved the original and this one completes it for me. It's excellant!
4,An ok cd . . .,"I have to say ""Irish Party in Third Class"" has gotten a lot of wear since I bought it three days ago. The added voices in that track are great too. But ""Come Josephine in My Flying Machine"" sucks, though, and the solo of ""Nearer my God to Thee"" isn't that great either. ""Titanic Suite"" is a bit TOO LONG, and it's basically the same music as the first one that's all combined. But it's great if you love the movie."
3,Mostly good...kind of blah,Even though I'm only 12 years old I'm not ignorant. I bought this CD thinking it was the original and found I was wrong so I listened to this for a while and I didn't really think it was TOO good. But I liked it when they included the Irish piece in there. But the people who made the CD smashed the main theme with all the people's voices in it-I got so distracted I didn't know what to think! Other than that I think it was a good sequel but not nearly as good as the first. Shoot! And I have to EARN the first CD out of my allowance now! I give it 3 stars because of the good themes in 3 places but not anywhere else.
5,"All this is is Part II of a Terrific Soundtrack, That's all...:?).","For those of you who have the first TITANIC movie soundtrack by James Horner in your collection, just do yourselves a favor and buy this one also. There is nothing on here that's fluff, there are a couple of suites on here and some added music from the movie that couldn't be squeezed into the original soundtrack but in my opinion, they could just come out with a special edition and make a two CD set out of it and put tracks in order and make it really ""sweet"".Get this CD, you won't be sorry."
5,the best i get on amazon,congratulations to tha seller an to amazon.com for this excellent service I m very sastified and happy because i get it fast secure and i find what i was looking for thanks
4,Music of a Century,"This CD was far better than the first one put out for Titanic. This has music that I am more interested in - the Celtic portion.'An Irish Party in Third Class', 'Jack Dawson's Luck' and so on. This is music that you can get up and dance to, unlike the first one which was very sit back and listen. The record is not all celtic, it has Nearer My God To Thee', 'My Heart Will Go On' and the main suite.One other thing that the second CD has unlike the first is dialogue incorporated into the songs, from the movie. Now, to be honest, it is a little strange. I think I would prefer it without the words. It is an interesting concept and definetly different just, for me, not wanted. Dialogue can be found through track 2, 7, 8 and 11.All in all, this CD profiles the movie wonderfully. It pretty much follows the movie from the suit down to the epilogue - The Deep and Timeless Sea'."
1,No more Titanic!,"Where is all that Titanicmania taking us? Well, I've got to admit Horner's score for Titanic is a good score.It's not outstanding but it's good. But all the tracks Horner didn't find good enough to be on the first album together with additional music no Horner fan is interested in and finally ""My Heart will go on"" with the actors' voices interfering is simply too much for me to bear. No offence against James Horner. If you want to listen to his really great achievements, why don't you give WILLOW or CASPER a chance?"
2,This album was pretty bad.,"I thought that this album would be excellent after the thrilling Titanic album. Unfortunately this had ""other"" music in it, and I really didn't enjoy it one bit. People, don't buy this album, it is much better buying the first one, which is terrific."
5,I absolutly loved it I would buy it.,I don't know about anybody else but i saw the movie and I have the soundtrack and I am not sick of it yet. I would reccomend that anybody who wants to buy it should.
5,Best One Yet,The next c.d. that came out was called Back to Titanic. It consisted of music that was not in the first volume. My Heart will go on was the last song on the c.d. it I think was the best. They changed it a lot from the first c.d. and I think that the new one is a lot better. There are more reasons why Back to Titanic deserves 5 stars. There are more but some one can't name them all.
3,Not as good as it should be,"Having listen to more than hundreds of soundtracks, more than thousands of themes. I think that this is a good one, though not one of the best. Many of the pieces are well-done, while the others are not. The tracks, which performed by the London Symphony Orchestra were great, I think that the orchestra should have been use more for the others. I wish that there will be ""My heart will go on"" play by the LSO someday. Anyway, this is nice one to have in your collection, especially, if you are a fan of the movie (but sorry, I'm a fan of it)"
3,"Titanic II drowns in dialouge,yet still enjoyable","The second Titanic cd sports wonderful Irish music(Jack Dawson's Luck, Lament). The Titanic Suite is wonderful and hauntingly dreamlike and even the highly overdone theme comes across gorgeously on ""Portrait"". This soundtrack was marred only by the constant babbling of the sea tossed lovers on ""Come Josephine"" (on which you hear Rose mornfully crying out for the drowned Jack in between lines of Marie Brennan's haunting ballad) and (most disapointingly) on the much anticipated ""Third Class Party"", on which most of the diologue from the steerage scene is reproduced. If Titanic fans want to hear that scene, they can rent the film...On the soundtrack it serves as an annoying distraction from the passionate reels of Gallic Storm. Yet in spite of these slight flaws, Back To Titanic stays afloat very well."
4,Another collection of titanics's fans,Actualy it is a good CD and everlasting (maybe). There is a surprise when the CD will capture the fans again. But there is still something which is boring. The song from Celine is given no excitement to the fans even-though adding the dialog.Overall it is still a great CD.
1,Product management commentary with the depth of a brochure,"Key word here is ""essentials"" since it never gets past commentary that is just trivial. The best part of the book is the suggested readings and resources that I should had bought instead of this brochure."
2,"If you are a product manager, you already know this stuff","This book is really good for people who need a ""birds eye view"" of product management like business journalists, CEOs/Directors and anybody and everybody who wants to ""know"" what product management is all about BUT doesnt have to ""Do"" it."
1,Idiots Guide to Software Product Management,"I suppose if you know absolutely nothing about software development this book might be worth the read; however, if you know what RUP means don't waste your time and money."
2,"If this book is helpful to you, you have no business being in software product management","This book might have been essential back in 1998 when any goof with a good idea started a software company. But we've moved WAY beyond that.Today, anyone in the software business should be able to have written this book. Its coverage is broad and cursory: development process, requirements management, product delivery, beta testing, pricing, internationalization, and more all in 139 pages (the rest of the book is sample documents).As an example of how shallow this book is, on page 129 she sees it necessary to define a ""byte"" as ""a single computer memory space."" Please. If you hope to be a software product manager but don't know what a byte is, don't give up your day job.The sample documents in the appendices are not bad but they don't justify the cost of the book.The book contains numerous instances of unclear writing which lead me to believe the book was not edited professionally."
2,Very thin on material,"Dont waste your money on this one. As someone pointed out , it should be titled 'Software Product Management Topics'. Instead i found 'Product Managers Handbook' more detailed and relevant."
2,Not quite impressed,"I would expect from a book with that impressive heading to be more generic, describing different approaches and types of situations - maybe not in detail, but somehow covering the field. What I've got was the PM experience of the author - certainly not useless, but too specific.For me it was a waste of money."
4,a jewel for sperm whale lovers,"Haven't yet seen ""Realm of the killer whales"" for my interest was on ""Sperm whale oasis"" wich I find very difficult to surpass. The narration is enough interesting ( though conventional) but there are at least 30 minutes of images beyond all expectation for their beauty as for their interest, creatures so rarely seen can be here observed as never before.Only comparable with that one about the search of the giant squid by National Geographic."
5,Can The Original Be Topped?,"If you don't mind extreme violence, this game is great in every way imaginable. Dark environments, demonic monsters, powerful weapons, they all make a great game.The game is quite immersive too. Being in a state of near death, knowing that monsters are hiding all around by the sounds they make, it's an eerie feeling that the game captures perfectly.Since I'm a sissy though, I always use the cheats and just destroy every monster in sight mercilessly. That's fun too. I particularly enjoy being in the middle of a whole mob of monsters that are trying to kill myself and each other. It's real fun to watch them fight each other. Man, this game is great.This is an expanded version of the original Doom so it has some new levels too. Even without the new levels I would give this game 5 stars, but the extra levels are still a nice bonus. Just make sure you have a fast enough computer, because some of the new level environments are pretty fancy."
3,Long but interesting,This book is not for the beginner---it can be along and confusing read---but if you have a grasp of feng shui then you will find it to be very helpful. I would say that this book complements beginnning books.
3,"Fair, but Flawed","The Scavenger, the second Timecop novel from Dan Parkinson, is a decent second outing, albiet not nearly as gripping as its predecessor or the next novel in ther series.Continuity fans will be glad to see Claire taking a more active role and mentions of events in the previous novel (Jack's house being bombed, Julie Price's duty with the TEC, etc.).Continuity fans will despise the fact that this novel continues the need for ""blast suits"" for time travel, which is completely absent in the TV series, and one cringes to notice that the story takes place *after* Viper's Spawn (whose ending takes place on Dec. 31, 2007), and yet still takes place, somehow, during 2007. It can't be both before *and* after your first novel, Mr. Parkinson."
1,failed research,"I looked into this book because I'm olive skinned and my husband is dark skinned. It was completely useless. Each chapter starts off with the bare basics of this is why, a letter from x, y and z complaining about the chapter title and a dermatologist saying ""I know what they mean. I have the same problem!"". It then gives you some insanely simple answers. Acne? Wash your face and use over the counter face washes and creams. Didn't help? Really? Go to a doctor. I had high hopes but nothing helpful. Just use Google. It's actually more helpful."
3,Light of the Spirit,This CD is not what was expected. It is not quite as consistant as Kitaro's music on satillite radio. It is good and easy to listen to. It is fairly good to relax to as well. Some of the music on this CD is not as relaxing as others.
5,"Hard on the eyes, easy on the ears","If you've never seen him live, be prepared for his urchin appearance, and if you've never heard him, be ready for a multilayered musical kaleidescopal experience. His music reminds me of running through the Japanese gardens in Fort Worth, Texas at the Botanical Gardens Arboretum. I am back at that place everytime I listen to Kitaro and I also begin to search for 106.1 ""Theee Oasis"" on the radio with such personalities as Charlie Jones, Janel, and Tempe Lindsey. Ah, those were the days. But it's so nice to have Kitaro anytime you need that Asian fix. A true master."
3,Lacking information,"The information for each chapter and subject is presented as all theory and the problems are not theory based. Also for those of us not directly out of school, the review of each chapter lacks information that the author just expects us to remember or know. I found the book incomplete in its discussions of topics based on the questions associated with each topic"
5,How to Make It Better...,"Sure, 5 stars like everyone else says: it does the job. But its a pain to use, like studying from a phone book. If you're really going to spend the hours needed with this book, make your life easier: Take it to Kinkos, have them shear off the binding, and comb bind it into smaller sections. Seven smaller sections worked for me; mark the spots at chapter boundaries so Kinkos knows where to split it up. Now you've got nice lay-flat, easy-to-carry sections that are 100% easier to work from. It'll cost about $30, but well worth it. You'll be the envy of your study group. 30 years out of school I thought that maybe the geezers should get a handicap, but the test went much better than I'd anticipated; no prayer required."
2,Not for everyone.,"If you're still in college or just fresh out of college, this would be an excellent source to help prep for the FE exam. On the other hand, if you've been out of college for a while and haven't used some of the skills you learned for a number of years, it would be better to take a prep class. Case in point, the calculus section condenses three semesters of calculus knowledge into roughly 5 pages. Fine if every aspect of calculus is fresh in your mind, otherwise you'll find yourself going back to your old textbooks for further review, essentially prepping for the prep book and requiring far more time to prep than the book suggests."
3,Great but not current,This is a comprehensive review but as the test format has drastically changed in 5 years a supplement is required to fully be prepared.
3,not the best source,I bought both this book and the book by Merle Potter. I would have to say that this book helped me recall somethings I forgotten...but I don't think alot of these problems were geared toward the ones on the test. I ended up sticking with this book and never really using the potter book. This was mainly because I was also taking a prep class in which they used this book for reference.....I did end up passing anyhow.
2,I bet there are better FERMs out there,"I was taking a review class and studying out of a book that wasn't really working. Someone reccomended this book. When I received this book, I was at the point that I had to do 2 chapters a day. It was a lot of work, but I stayed on schedule. I would definately reccomend 1 chapter a day if you want to have any sort of life. I really disliked the review on fluids and mechanics of materials, I did not take these classes in school, and was hoping to have short summary that would give me an idea of what was going on. (No luck) The book claims to follow the NCEES Handbook, but I found I wasted a lot of time searching for the formulas. This manual does not even tell you which section it is pulling the formulas from. The real test will be when I take the test this Saturday."
5,question,"If the test is changing its format for October 2005, does that mean this book won't be relevant for the next test?"
1,Missing Chapters,I recieved this book 10/14/02 and it was missing chapter 27 and parts of chapter 26 and 28. Watch out! If you don't need to know thermo maybe that's ok.
4,Passed in my first try,Used this book to help study for the FE test in 2005. Was a great tool and helped a lot. the example questions worked very well and in the end i passed the exam on my first attempt. i have to imagine there is a new edition though.
2,STAY AWAY THIS BOOK WILL BOAR YOU TO DEATH!!!!!!!!,"I had to read this dumb book for english class. It was the hardest book to understand. The use of volcabulary was astounding. He couldnt just state something, Dickens had to go and use every word in his volcabulary. It has soooooo many word that you get lost. I read the chapters over and over and never understood them. The next day my teacher would tell us what the chapters were about. Only then did i understand the book. BEWARE THIS BOOK WILL FRY YOUR BRAIN BEFORE YOU UNDERSTAND IT."
5,penultimate clarinet musings from the master,"This album is all the evidence necessary to secure giuffre's place as the genius who pioneered the clarinet's place as a valid free jazz voice. ""FREE FALL"" takes the massive advancements made by the triumvirate of giuffre, bley & swallow on earlier (& equally essential) ablums such as, ""THESIS"" & ""FUSION"" to the nth degree of creativity. Comprised of duos, trios & a multitude of sublime solo clarinet reflections this disc is a pleasure from the first plaintive strains of 'propulsion' to the closing whispers of 'let's see'...but don't take my word for it, do your ears a favor & pick-up this far-reaching slice of avant chamber jazz & see where everyone from anthony braxton to perry robinson first got their chops."
4,exquisite,"i ran across Jimmy Giuffre on accident. i only picked him up because of my devout love of Paul Bley. but this record, and anything really with this trio, is excellent. Jimmy Giuffre is a very underated player. One might compare him to Don Byron. he is lyrical and so are Steve Swallow and Paul Bley. this is a good avant garde record to start out on. it is free jazz mixed with cool jazz tendencies. i highly recommend it."
5,Muball,A must-read for all kids. Great true story about what a difference the smallest kid on the team makes. Might and determination wins out over size.
5,A wonderful story,I bought this book after reading it at the public library. It teaches a wonderful lesson about perseverance. Any baseball fan (young or old) would enjoy this story.
3,No Rain Delay?,"Apparently, the umpire knew nothing about a rain delay. In this most unlikely of tales, a player hits the ball in a downpour for the shortest homerun ever. Could this really happen? Not a chance. The game would have been at least delayed until the rain let up. But so what. Delightful illustrations accompany this story told for the fun of it. Wonder if the game was protested by the opposing club? They definitely would have a case. Rained enough to create huge mud puddles and the game continued? Hmmmmmm."
2,"Weak, pretentious, juvenile","One of the worst books I have encountered in the past year. There are a host of technical problems, especially with regard to point of view, which is rarely clear. The characters are utterly unbelievable. (Confronted by a violent animal rights activist, Mercedes hands him her fur jacket, suddenly agreeing with him that ""It is stupid!"") Most unforgivable is the use of the f-word in the authorial voice, as in ""They resumed f***ing."" This book was silly and ultimately boring."
3,great purchase,"I know I saved a hundred bucks buying this book online, it was in great shape and I received it within a weeks time."
3,All-clad handles need a re-design,"We use the small butter warmer for everything from warming said butter to creating reduction sauces. This past spring, we needed to have another but couldn't find a duplicate to our Kitchen-Aid counterpart, so we went with the All-Clad. The little All-Clad version does a fine job--it heats quickly and controllably and is as sturdy a pot as you'll find. That said, I hate the handle. In fact, the reason we do not own any other All-clad products is because of the uncomfortable angle of the handles. While hefting them at the local Williams-Sonoma store, I found the handles to be especially awkward on the larger pots and pans. Too bad considering the excellent workmanship and fine heating characteristics."
3,Missed the Boat?,"Okay, United Artists has been around since 1919, and where are all of the films from the company's early days? One would think that a collection proposing to highlight 90 years of a great film studio's output might... just might... include some of the glories from UA's formative period. Sure, there is a lot of good stuff here, but the title doesn't give a good indication of what this box set is all about, and the absence of those early films just doesn't do it for me."
3,UA 90TH ANIVERSARY PRESTIGE COLLECTION -POOR Q/C!,"FACTORY SEALED (UPC CODE & ENDORSEMENT AD STICKER ON FLAWLESS SHRINK WRAP) THEREFORE,ONE CANNOT FAULT THE VENDOR FOR THE FOLLOWING: THE HEFTY 26+ LB MONSTER IS HOUSED IN A FLIMSY SPINED BINDER WHICH QUICKLY DIVORCES ITSELF FROM ADHERRING BACK BOARDS,CAUSING TEARING TO THEM MANY DISKS NOT INSERTED INTO POCKETS W/MARRING/ SCRATCHES-MANUF. POOR Q/C FOR A SET INTENDED TO BE THE HALLMARK SET OF THIS PROLIFIC MOVIE CO.! THERE NEEDS TO BE A GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION LABEL OF HOW TO REMOVE THE BINDER FROM THE METAL BOX -WHICH SHOULD BE DONE WITH THE BOX FLAT, SO ALL WEIGHT IS OFF THE FAULTY SPINES AND DISKS DO NOT COME SPILLING OUT WHICH ARE NOT INITIALLY IN POCKETS, SECURELY PLACED! MY SUGGESTION- IF POSSIBLE, KEEP BINDER OUT OF CASE, FLAT ON A SURFACE TO AVOID FURTHER TEARING. 80% A+++ MOVIES."
4,"some questionable titles, but still quite nice",reading through the list it starts to look like an impressive collection. but then two different versions of movies like Living Daylights (the worst Bond movie ever made)? Red Dawn and Roadhouse? slapped on as an homage to Patrick Swayze?but you can still throw away this junk and have a fine summary collection of great films. i hesitate buying it simply from the reviews of questionable quality of the DVDs themselves.
5,Amazing Find!,"I have been looking all over the web for this set and everyone is out of stock.I am a movie buff and have been a huge fan of United Artists releases for decades. When I found out about this gift set containing 90 movies on 110 DVD's I was blown away. Just look at the list of contained movies, they are nearly all classics and some great newer titles as well. I have spent the last few weeks looking for the set for myself and a close friend for a Xmas gift who I used to watch many of these titles with. My search is finally over!If you are looking for a fantastic holiday gift for the movie buff on your list, look no further. I just hope they have enough for everyone interested.3 thumbs up!"
4,"Close to perfection, but not quite","I don't yet own this set, but look forward to soon. My only gripe, besides a few bad movies, is the fact not all are presented in wide screen. I understand several of the older films were originally filmed in a 3X4 aspect ratio, that's fine. What I don't understand is why some films like the award winner Annie Hall isn't offered in it's original wide screen format? Especially since Roadhouse is. If these are the classics, why not give us the original director's vision? And I'm glad they included many of the 2 disc editions of films such as Rocky and Raging Bull."
5,Just received my set and its fabulous,I love it. I just received my set from another dealer and it is a real thrill. I sold off some the movies I owned in it previously and am glad I did. The set is luxurious and has most of the newest versions of the movies. I was able to sell the 35 movies I owned in it to nearly come up with the funds to purchase the 90 movies contained here for a nice exchange. The book is very nice as well as the metal and glass structure that holds it. Look for a bargain on it with help from coupons.
3,4 star movies 3 star packaging,This set has some great movies and several old titles the younger generation might not have heard of but will truly enjoy.My only problem is the case. It's rather awkward and hard to the dvd book out of the glass case. So once you do you wind up not wanting to put it back in. It looks great but if they had designed the case to open in a way that made it easy to put the dvds in and take them out i would give it a higher score.
2,Poor Execution of Stated Theme,"Billed as an outline of technologies capable of changing commercial air travel, this book presents instead a personal air travel memoir by a private pilot. The book devotes only one chapter to air equipment development that can impact the travel industry, unless the reader agrees that large numbers of air travelers will become general aviation pilots and service their travel needs in personal aircraft. The book is entertaining, but looks narcisistic when compared to the stated topic."
1,Aviation Issues,"About 2 years ago an article was written in Aviation Week and Space Technology Magazine titled 'The future of commercial travel is on smaller aircraft.' What started out as an enjoyable read, turned disturbing as every issue Fallows raised was covered in that original article."
1,The Master Reviewd,"Received the title The Master, however, it was not the correct movie.I'm expecting The Master that is shown above and actually received The Master starring Jet Li, a whole different cover face...I was very disappointed. I did not return the movie due to how inconvenient the procedure was...I may now look into purchasing movies at video stores...that way i know I'm at least purchasing the right one."
2,Uninspiring compared to Apple Venus,"I would not have rushed to buy another XTC album after hearing all the tracks on this one. Perhaps you need to be a long term fan to really get into it. For me it was rather uninspiring, I found the melodies and feel of most tracks somewhat repetitive. Fortunately, I heard some clips from XTC's 'Apple Venus' courtesy of amazon.com and found it excellent. By contast it is very creative and emotive - a much better bet for my taste."
3,This young upstart was disappointed,"I first XTC when someone gave me Apple Venus, and I was bewitched. Eagerly expecting more of the same, I digested the recomendations on this site and bought Skylarking. A bitter disappointment indeed, but I should have known better.Perhaps I am not qualified to comment, not being a dyed-in-the-wool fan since their early days, but if you want the haunting melody and intelligent structure of Apple Venue, don't buy this album. The tracks are jerky, the melodies obvious and downright tedious. ""Dear God"", potentially a winner, is ruined by the 1980's delight in using children's voices to signify some sort of innocence or closeness to God. If you, as I did, jumped on the XTC bandwagon in the late 1990's, DON'T GO BACK! Wait for their next album, and enjoy its brilliance safe in the knowledge that you are not missing anything pre-1990."
5,Great Bowl!,"As uncomplicated as a mixing bowl is, All-Clad really raises the bar. Stunning looks aside, this bowl is a snap to clean and the quality of construction is outstanding. I love the ability to nest the bowls (as I own the 3,5 & 7 quart) and stable base. Definitely worth the hefty price."
5,Legend of the Lone Ranger,"A great movie about how the Lone Ranger became the Lone Ranger.. I have purchased Legend of the Lone Ranger, Enter the Lone Ranger and The Lone ranger Triumph. These three videos are one and the same just in diffenent format. By purchasing the Legend of the Lone Ranger you will have all three of these videos."
5,Should be called the lost episodes- and the best.,"Even though I have been a Lone Ranger fan since the 50's, I was surprised that I had never seen the first three television episodes from 1949. I don't recall ever seeing any of these in syndication. I was also surprised at how good they were- actually better than many of the later episodes.These three shows explain everything that I was curious about as a kid: the origin of the Lone Ranger, Where Tonto came from, how he found Silver, the meaning of the silver bullets, the vow to never shoot to kill.... It is all there, everything I wondered about as a boy.I supposed some people will consider the dialog and the acting to be old fashion. I ,however, liked the fact that the actors took the ideals of the show seriously (justice, law, order, decency, fairness and good) There is no tongue-in-check ""spoofing"" or laughing at these ideals. I rate these three episodes right up there with any western that I have ever seen- and I've seen alot."
3,First Episode of Lone Ranger Series,"This is it! If you are a Lone Ranger fan, this is a must have. Somewhat stiff and hokey action and script, but that is the kitsch of the series. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels in b & w not as picturesque as the color series, but all in all very interesting three story arc."
1,Bad review,This product arrived to me un useable it had pages that we're falling out and every single page was written on. Plus it was an out dated book.Very disapointed with this item.My son needed for school and I had to scramble to find a NEW Copy
5,The Destructive Narcissistic Pattern changed my life!,"This is an excellent book which thoroughly addresses the signs of symptoms of the narcissistic personality. For years I used to think, ""If I could only find the right words,I could explain to my husband how much his behavior is hurting me and others."" Professor Brown has a deep understanding of what the experience is like for a family member. She not only addresses the behavior of the person with narcissistic behavior, but the thoughts, feelings and experience of loved ones. She gives guidelines and coping strategies to establish clear boundaries."
4,"My daughter loves ""Dora Princes""!","My 3 year old has her own iPad and has managed to rent it on her own while I wasn't at work, so I finally bought it. She adores this movie, at least the first half. It only gets four stars because I can't seem to get her to watch the second half."
4,My niece likes it,"Personally I can't stand Dora but my 4 year old niece loves her. So, if she's entertained (and quiet) when this is on I'm happy. I'm not sure of the educational value but my niece does pay attention and do the little movements and exercises. I'd recommend for the young kids."
2,stop n scratch,I thought this was a almost new tape. The box came messed up and not rapped.I wanted to return this because its so damaged.Its more trouble then what this tape is worth. I won't buy from this person again. I'm going to tell my friends who order from amazon not to order from this dealer. This tape was for my granddaughter birthday gift. I've been swipe by swiper.
5,dora fan,we love it all of us one of the better of the doras worth having in your collection and worth the price
5,Dora the Explorer DVD,My daughter loved this movie so much on Christmas Day that I am most certainly thinking about getting another Dora DVD with a different title of course.....The seller of this DVD was very up front with me about the product and told me everything that was wrong with it and all (being no book and not correct case)..... The seller shipped me the product in a very fast and timely manner also.....I will buy from this seller again in the future.....Thank you!
4,Totally exceeded expectations,"Totally exceeded expectations for my child, enjoy the Dora series, very nice, always about setting things right and learning along the way, very good."
1,Terrible disappointment,"I immediately ordered A WINDOW ACROSS THE RIVER as I was indelibly impressed with STARTING OUT IN THE EVENING. Well, it was a bore, its plot was mundane, the characters held no interest, and I cannot recommend.This does not in any way dilute my recommending STARTING OUT IN THE EVENING, however."
4,Wonderful for what it is,"a slim story here gets the royal treatment from Morton, whose previous work ""Starting Out in the Evening"" was also a great novel. If you like novels more concerned with character than ideas, this one is for you. Quite funny as well."
3,A Window to Marginal Writing,"I purchased this book at a 1/2 Price bookstore. While it held my interest enough to finish, I probably should not have started it!"
3,Not the best,I've read over half of the Spenser books. This definitely wasn't one of my favorites. The story line was slow and not as much clever banter and action as usual. I wouldn't recommend it for a first read. But still a great book.
4,Parker Book,"What can I say . . . I got it on time, it's Robert B. Parker and sure to please my husband for Christmas."
4,A fast read,"I feel the relationships between Spenser and Susan and Spenser and Hawk were not developed enough in this novel. If I weren't an avid fan of Spenser novels, I would not know the true relationship between these three (which is part of the fun of these books). Hawk and Susnan included. This book is a good read - quick and funny but I was disappointed in just the glimpse you got of Hawk and Susan."
3,Spenser for hire.,"I don't mean to say these books are not worth reading. In each I laugh a little and think a little, there is enough mystery to keep the pages turning and a faint hard boiled edge that I like."
2,Not a detective novel,"If you are looking for a good mystery or detective novel, take a pass on this. It is about Spencer taking a troubled kid under his wing and helping him find his way. The actual investigative nature of the novel is probably less than 15 pages...which is neatly wrapped up with a quick ride to the bad-guy's office and shooting him.I'd pass on this one if I had it to do over again."
3,Spenser for hire,"My first Spenser novel - but 7th in the series. Probably my last Spenser novel, but it wasn't bad. The humor of the story did draw me in, and I did want to see what happened, but I can't say I would go out of my way to read more of them. The humor in the story was definitely apparent - but having seen the TV series all I could see was Robert Urich throughout the book. In this one, a woman hires Spenser to find her son. Said son is with the father. Spenser brings the son back, and then second-guesses his decision but lets it be. But not for long. Like I said, not a bad read, but not my first choice. Surprising, I admit, since humor is usually foremost in my choices."
1,"Hardy Boys for Bigger Kids, but its not as good","I read this book for a class, yes a class, and in reading this book I had to look beyond the fact that my teacher has an infatuation with small boys in tights. I looked beyond that and tried to get into the story, but it seemed that the plot came out of an old Lassie Show. The authour has next to no writing skill, and he seems to keep pumping out books for the money. If you want to contribute to this quest, buy the book, if you are sane you won't."
5,One of the best so far . . .,"Outstanding! This is by far one of the best of this series! The relationship development of both Spenser and the boy he wants to rescue from neglect is not only moving, but strikes a chord of realism. This is a great story, and I would recommend it to any one!!"
2,Robert Parker Early Autumn,Printed very poorly with missing pages and smeared print. The story is fine but the book is a last class printing job..
5,Detective Spenser,"Robert Parker has done a great job of depicting Spenser's tough but funny personality, a character who made brilliant decisions for his actions taken in the book. The book is about a divorce between two parents, and a fight for their 15 year old son. The father hires thugs to kidnap his son, while the mother responds by hiring detective Spenser to get him back. Bringing the son back to the mother, Spenser finds that neither mother nor father care about being with their son Paul. Spenser then decides to take Paul under his own arms and starts showing him how to become a man and survive against his opponents, while trying to find a way so Paul's parents won't try to take him back. I think this book was a very good read, and I recommand it to any reader who likes any kind of suspense, drama, or action, because this book has all."
3,Robert Parkers--Early Autumn,"I like Parkers books, this one was ok, but have read some others I like much more. Will continue reading Parkers books."
4,Early Autumn,"This was a very fast moving mystery. I loved it. Spenser is a great detective. This was not a thick book, but the story was great. I know you will enjoy it."
5,Excellent,"What can I say besides this is a great book. It really helps understand Ringeck's work. Get this book if you are interested in German Longsword fighting. Though if you are starting off I would recommend the excellent book Fighting with the German Longsword, also written by Tobler.This book also works well with Sigmund Ringeck's Knightly Art of The Longsword by Lindholm and Svard. Same material but some different interpretations.If you are interested in this book go to the publisher's website. It's in stock there at the regular price, not this inflated used market price at Amazon."
2,"Did not fit new all-clad 12"" fry pan","I sent this item back because the fit was very poor considering how much the lid cost. When charging premium prices, the workmanship should match."
4,Good Lid,"This lid is well made, and fits the skillet we purchased at the same time perfectly. There are only two small drawbacks, first the lid should use the same stay cool handle technology as the pans use. I scorched my fingers a bit the first time I used the lid. The second improvement would be to make it in the USA just like the rest of the cookware."
3,"Lid just ""ok.""","Well, it's not the quality I've come to expect from All-Clad; however, it suits my needs.As previously reported, it isn't perfectly flush with the pan 100%, but that only affects the seal. If I need a really tight seal on something, I always put foil between the pan and lid, anyway. (Not that I think I should have to, but it's an old habit whether I need it or not, so I'm personally not bothered by the fit.)The lid is overpriced, but it matches my cookware.What really impressed me was the delivery speed. I ordered this at 6:30 last night and it arrived before 1:30 this afternoon. Wow. I wasn't expecting it until Monday with Amazon prime."
1,Get the Calphlon lid AND PAN for same price instead,"I had the All Clad skillet, but needed a lid. This lid is way over-priced. As others have suggested, the Calphlon Simple 12"" non-stick pan WITH LID costs less and the glass, domed lid is a perfect fit for the All-Clad 12"" skillet. Two for one."
3,"Expensive, but nice","This lid alone costs more than most pans. It is an extravagent expense, but if you regularly use lids then you are stuck with this option if you want to buy something that is going to fit your All-clad pan correctly. Of course, it is well-made with heavy steel and seems as expensive as it is, but if you are only buying a lid for completeness, and you just won't use it much, keep your $50."
2,sloppy fit,"As another reviewer pointed out, this lid doesn't seal as well as it should. I suppose the 5-star reviews received a slightly different product.In comparison, the All-Clad lids for my 10.5 inch frying pan an 1-quart sauce pan fit perfectly.I gave it only 2 stars because of the fit was not what I expect for a $47 lid."
2,"unlike the pan you'll be covering it with, this is not made in the US","This lid is actually made in China, not the US. I'm willing to pay more for domestic labor, but the price is pretty egregious considering its origins."
2,Made in China/discontinued by All Clad,"After reading the reviews for this item, I called All-Clad customer service to ask about complaints that this lid did not fit the pan properly. While they did not admit to any product defect, I found out that this item was made in China, and has now been discontinued.All-Clad used to make all their stainless steel lids in China, but they recently brought lid manufacturing back to the USA (wonder why!!??). So their NEW line of lids is made here. However, the NEW line doesn't include a 12"" fry pan lid. They decided there was not enough demand for it, so they are not making a 12"" as part of their USA-made product line.What this means is that the old, China-made, potentially ill-fitting 12"" lids are all we can get now -- while supplies last.I don't plan on buying one of the China-made ones. I'm taking other reviewers' advice and finding a different brand that will work - probably for less money."
3,George Burns and Gracie Allen Vol 2,"I really enjoyed the shows. It was great to see this couple again. It took me back to a simpler time. The problem I have with this disk is the quility of the recording it self. I know these shows are quit old. Some of the shows are over exposed. The titles where a completly washed out. Some of the shows where completly washed out. To me it is quit fun to see the old commercials, back then a thrity minuet show was twenty five minutes long. Now a thirty minuet show is only twenty minutes. I gave the disk three stars only because of the condition of the shows."
3,good and bad news,"The good news. ALlen was spectacular in her delivery of jokes. They rolled off her tongue as if she really believed it herself.It is said to be digitally remastered. The clarity is very good quality considering it is 1950. The sound, well that part they forgot to remaster, it has to be high to hear what they are saying sometimes.As for Burns, his lines were about half good jokes and the delivery of his was not that great. Good thing he was an excellent writer.Overall, for jsut a few dollars (shipping included) it is reasonable. More than $4... I would probably pass."
4,Pros and Cons - still worth it.,"The Jack Benny episode is so washed out it's almost an artistic statement. However, it's also a very funny episode. All these are great episodes - picture and sound quality on the rest are better, although still wanting for restoration. If I knew the Benny episode was visually so bad I still would have bought the set. B&A were hilarious - I hope further sets are easier to watch."
3,Refreshingly funny in places...but VERY apparent is a copy of a copy of a copy!!!,Nice to not hear vulgarities and obscenities in comedy!Just wish there is some way to copy to where visual and audio was clearer.
3,Buy for the history,"From a purely technical and musical standpoint, the recording serves as a greaat starting point for those interested in listening to Les Mis. The orchestration and mixing of the tracks are done very well. However, it falls apart when it comes to the quality of the voices of the cast. Valjean is annoying, compared with others. For a casual fan, Les Miserables: Highlights From The Complete Symphonic International Cast Recording is a much better choice. While sacrificing content, the quality (and price) of the voices is remarkable. Particuarly good are the Confrontation, and Who Am I? Gary Morris does a superb job as Valjean in that recording. But, if you're interested in the musical progression (the musicality of just simple things such as small rythmic changes in the newer recording) from the Broadway recording, this is a must have. Don't get me wrong, still a great piece of musical beauty: for lovers of Broadway, its a must have."
4,Soulful Stuff,"Fans of Terry Reid's voice, Thomas Beaudry of Frigid Pink voice will surely enjoy the vocals on this record. The music itself is somewhat diverse intertwining elements of folk, progressive rock, blues and blue-eyed soul with an edge. I hear plenty of early Mott The Hoople elements throughout this recording as well. If you grew up in the 70s and listened to music on the outskirts of the norm you will more than likely enjoy this recording. Additionally, my compliments to the other 3 reviewers of this record - most impressive."
1,Messy messy messy,"I am an all clad lover, and I have wanted the pentola for a long time. The pot is great (think stews,soups, etc). With the insert for pasta, it was a mess--water spurted out the sides and made a huge mess. Maybe I'm using it wrong? Great concept--had tried a cheaper version a few years back with the same problem.For pasta, I'll use my cheap, light plain stainless pasta pot."
5,Gothenburg revived,"While I'm not sure exactly where these guys are from, I assume its scandinavia somewhere, I should do my research, but I'm only interested in the music, they certainly sound like the Gothenberg scene, but have an energy that most of the late nineties bands have sadly lost. While I like the new In flames and Katatonia, etc albums, they dont have what their early albums had.This band looks to be a bunch of young blokes starting out fresh, and they certainly sound that way. Out of the twelve tracks, six are really good, heavy ,rocking tracks, although slower than some may like, the others are all O.K. If you dont know what they sound like ,it is similar to Inflames or soilwork, yet has its own musical style, it has some keyboard backing, and the vocals sound a bit more metalcore in style, with some clean vocals. The only downside is the price of this CD, but theres enough quality tracks to make it worth buying."
2,eh?,"I was always a huge fan of norther and this album they took a couple steps down.....I liked this the first time i heard it, and then i didn't hear any cool melodies and solos of the past, they are completley changed with crappy vocals and lyrics now.. dont buy this, Stick with Mirror of Madness or Dreams of endless war, even death unlimited is way better then this Album. Dissapointed..."
5,Is very nice!,I really loved this CD! Is like all Kitaro's CDs. Very good! I really recomend this one!
3,Disappointing,The track and album titles are excellent~~~~ but having Kitaro go solo all day on his keyboards just does not appeal to me. Ambitious (as always) but not good enough.Badly needed an orchaestra to bring that raw emotion out.
5,Damn,"This CD is beyond awesome. It hurts when you hear some of the other ""Punk"" bands who have made it big, then you hear a CD like this and realize that you're 1 of maybe 100 who actually own it. These guys are awesome live, but this CD really ... blew me away. You can hear with songs like ""Hello"" and ""You and Everything"" that they do have the potential to end up on more popular radio stations. Although, ""Feel The Pain"" was the song of the CD that Doughmain decided to promote. It's a great heavy song, but not exactly radio friendly. All the songs on here are awesome, that's all I can say. Go out and buy it today!"
2,Damaged Freezer,"Freezer arrived damaged, there is an ugly dent on the top, so I have to place something over the top to cover this blemish. I purchased this from Amazon with super saver shipping, and it did not come with adequate packaging. However, the freezer seems to work alright a week in, so hopefully the dent on the top is the only problem with the product. It is fairly quiet, I bought it for my bedroom, but it has woken me up a few times in the night when it clicks on, but it is usually fairly quiet and seems to keep things very cold. Hopefully this product is durable and reliable,but it's too early to say."
4,Good freezer for an RV,"The compact fridge/freezers generally found in RV's such as ours have very limited space and freezing capacity. Instead, we have put a smaller refrigerator model and this small dedicated freezer into the same space. It works great. The freezer is keeping our frozen things very solid using a medium setting on the thermostat. It has enough room to keep quite a bit of food for the two of us - if you pack it efficiently. It was easy to change the door opening side and it seals tightly.The only thing that is a little annoying is that the door sits just a little bit unevenly on the front of the unit, so while the unit is actually sitting level, it appears to be sitting crooked."
5,arrived with no dents or scrapes,Contrary to a lot of reviews earlier the freezer arrived with a fairly abused outer box but there was bubble wrap to absorb the punishment so we found no dents or scratches. It worked immeditely and is very quiet. Seems just the right size to use when we need a freezer on trips.
3,Pretty good,"Like other reviewers - my freezer came with a small dent on one of the corners. The freezer itself still works fine though.Size is nice, but there's a light humming noise from the freezer which can get a little annoying for some people. I have this freezer in my room, but I seem to be able to ignore the humming."
2,freezer model Haier HUM013EA,"good freezer, but arrived damaged with dent in corner due to lackproper inside packaging, for this reason do not buy freezer!!!!!!!"
1,Item arrived damaged,"The freezer arrived with a large dent in the upper rear right corner. It works, so it would be very hard to send back since the packaging fell apart after the straps were take off. Terrible packing. Can't figure out how to get some kind of credit on this damaged item. Not happy!"
3,works great,i dont need to be sitting here wasting my time ahving to write a certain number of words to give my opinion
2,What's up?,I returned this item because it was too small. Amazon knows this so why am I even being asked to review it?
1,Broke,"Length:: 3:00 MinsPurchased February 4thBroke April 24thLife Span: 80 DaysUpdate: Still broken. It's now sitting in the shed, sorry for the weak voice my voice has changed since then :/."
3,Haier HUM013EA 1-2/7 Cubic Foot Compact Upright Freezer,"Ordered this unit from Amazon.com and received it two days sooner than advised-great delivery time. Like others who have experienced damage with this same freezer we received ours damaged. The left bottom side, in the rear has a crushed corner and while the damage does not appear to prevent the freezer from working (have had it operating, now, approximately three hours) properly we will not ask for a replacement unless something isn't working right after a few days of operation. Do hope Amazon finds the root problem for these Compact Freezers being damaged during shipment or prior to shipment.The adjustable T'stat for the freezer is a welcomed control and we look forward to utilizing the freezer in our RV."
5,good freezer,"Freezer arrived in timely fashion, undamaged. Used on first dog show outting, kept 15 ics packs frozen solid. Exchanged packs every 12 hours. was pleased with unit."
1,Worst product I ever purchased,"I bought this product simply to make ice and when I got my freezer it was dented and would get extremely hot on the outside. I replaced it and was assured by the manufacturer that the first one was simply defective. The second one did the same thing. When I called the company on several occasions, I got different information from each person that I talked too. One person told me that I should turn the temperature in the freezer down! This freezer is a fire hazard and I would recommend that it not be purchased for any reason!"
1,Haier Hum013EA 1-2/7 cu ft freezer,"About the compact freezer Hum013EAUnfortunately I cannot rate this freezer; the one you sent me was a ""lemon"". It didn't work, apparently there was no refrigerant material in it. It was plugged -in for over 72 hours and the inside remained at room temperature. I unplugged it nand noticed that the compressor was extremely burning hot; I couldn't touch it with bare hands. I called The Haier company and explained what happened. they responded that they would replace it. So now I am awaiting a new replacement for the lemon that you shipped me.Sorry about that and the negative rating; I couldn't go any lower than one star."
4,So sad swing is dead.....again,"I just bought this cd, several years after release, lots of these bands I have seen live and danced to.....my faves are The Red Hot Skillet lickers & The Fyling Nuetrinos. The most authentic thing on here Is Set'Em Up Joe's ""She Can't Dance,"" straight L.Jordan..........and I think they wrote the Nuetrino's ""Mr. Zoot Suit."" It is sad the SNs drove this into the ground because it really was nice to dress up and go out dancing, real dancing............buy this cd if you want to know what the short lived craze was all about.Tomi Jenkins"
2,Seems a bit dated,"Although I don't think this book will actually harm you and Robert Haas has worked with some of the top tennis players, I find this book a bit dated and, as many books on diet, one- sided. Pro Tennis is a buisness, so it's important to give your best performance. But does ""Eat To Win"" mean, eat to win a match(and big money involved with that match) or eat to win in general? Eat To Win is for me one of those books that seemed great in the Eighties but twenty years later you're not too sure about the facts in this book. Many top athletes might use this book but many top athletes have eating disorders as well. I felt after reading this book, if you only look at a bottle of kitchen oil, you turn fat, since it more or less excludes any form of fat and I've never been fat in my whole life. I don't know if being TOO conscious about what you're eating actually helps or confuses you and this is how I felt with this book."
2,"Should perhaps be called ""Eat to Get Fat""","I switched my diet from the traditional bodybuilding diet (lowfat high protein) to the high carboyhdrate low animal protein diet in Eat to Win. Although I'd always been underweight, this book changed that. Unfortunately, even though I was doing heavy weight training, most of the weight I put on was fat. I still have the stretch marks it piled on so fast. I would give this 1 star for that debacle, however, the attention on blood profiles, cholestrol and triglycerides was ahead of the pack, and therefore give it 2."
1,A Poor Choice,"This is certainly better than the more modern low-carb fad diets, but it's similar to them in that it's based on pseudoscience, annecdotal evidence, and general misunderstandings of how the body works. Haas has basically repackaged the Pritikin diet from the 70s and added some of his own mumbo jumbo. Unless you're an endurance athlete eating a huge volume of calories to keep up with your expenditures, you probably won't get enough protein from this diet.Do some real research, and follow the simple (and un-magical) recommendations of researchers who have done real peer-reviewed studies.As far as my own annecdotal evidence, my performance in cycling and alpine climbing improved immensely when I ditched the Haas plan and embraced a more traditional 60-25-15 diet designed for athletes."
1,Eat to Get Fat,"Haas needs to get with the 21st century. I hope he does not quit his day job! Eating processed foods to lose weight is not the way to go. With his plan, your insulin levels will sky rocket and your system will be a mess.Pass this book by, please!!"
5,This diet lowers cholesterol !!,"I read this book, tried the diet, and lowered my cholesterol level from 280 to 170. I experiment with food and dietary regimes just for fun and this is the only one i found that seriously affected my blood chemistry. I've tried other diets and my cholesterol is back up, so it's time to pick up a new copy of the book and get back on the plan!"
5,Pack with great information on maple syrup.,I love Vermont and have visited there frequently. Visited and bought maple products but never had a recipe book on the subject. Not only a great deal price wise but love the recipes. Easy to follow and turn out perfect. Best little recipe book on maple syrup. I really enjoy it
4,Another winner from Ms. Fairchild,"At 24, Sarah finally gets her first season in London. Although she has had a marriage agreement with a neighbor since childhood, she finds herself with many suitors. She comes to care particularly for Ashley ""Hawkes"" Castleford, but it seems he only cares about her in a friendly way, while his cousin Stewart courts her more ardently.One of the hallmarks of this book is that the blind heroine is *not* a tortured, self-pitying soul who must be saved from herself. She is for the most part happy, having been without sight since childhood. The descriptions of how she senses people, and the scenes of friends and suitors helping her to ""see"" and reading to her are marvelous."

3,Not for the novice,"This package is what I would consider to be the ""Photoshop"" of music editing software. If all you want to do is strip the vocals off pieces of recorded .mp3's in order to dub over them with your own voice, this is NOT the tool for you. I could not figure out how to use it and the Help was not very helpful.On the other hand, it does come with many different options and loads of separate guitar, drum, piano, etc. loops that you can use if you're savvy about synchronizing these things with other musical loops you already have. This is probably a good piece of software for composers and people who want to alter the beat, tone, pitch, etc. of self-recorded clips. I don't know why they advertise it as having anything to do with American Idol because it's fairly useless for singers."
4,American Idol music maker starts here,"I found the Extreme Music Maker somewhat easy to use once I got the hang of it. It's so easy to create your own style of music with all theaccessories and, I liked the ""where my dogs"" track the best. Its so easy to mix N match .. All U wanna be Idols.. this could be for YOU... As a part time DJ I like the beats and built in bass lines to start my own songs..."
2,Couldn't figure out how to use it,USER UNFRIENDLY.Too much effort to learn how to use this product.Donated it to GOODWILL.
3,Nice package of hits.,"The material on this collection is pretty good. All of the songs are decent and well-played. Terri Nunn has a smooth and likeable voice--she does a nice job. I don't consider much of the material on here to be new wave though. It's more like pop. The guitar and synth playing is good throughout. The songs that I find to be most enjoyable are ""You Don't Know,"" ""Sex (I'm A...),"" and ""Take My Breath Away."" I like how the synth playing on ""Take My Breath Away"" sounds bouncy. ""Sex (I'm A...)"" is energetic and interesting (pretty wild tune). ""You Don't Know"" is a very listenable and atmospheric song with some nice playing. This is a worthy collection of songs from Berlin."
2,Does not do justice,"Berlin were a great band from the eighties, but this compilation is only worth two stars for having such a poor selection of tracks on it. The first three Berlin albums could easily cough up more songs than the 12 featured here, for example ""Tell Me Why"" and ""Pleasure Victim"" surely deserve to be aired again, as well as ""When We Make Love"". It's a good place to start, but I would recommend buying the first three albums instead if you can find them, because this CD is not really covering the ""best of"" Berlin"
4,BERLIN--TAKE MY BREATH AWAY....,TERRI NUNN AND BERLIN ..ONE OF THE GREAT LADIES OF THE NEW WAVE SCENE OF THE 80'S..ALL THEIR HITS ARE HERE SEX.I'M A..THE METRO--MASQUERADE--NO MORE WORDS--NOW IT'S MY TURN--THIS CD IS A MUST FOR THOSE 80'S NEW WAVE FANS..ALSO RECOMEND--QUARTERFLASH--THE BEST OF..THE DIVINYLS..ESSENTIAL--ROMEO VOID--WARM IN YOUR COAT AND THE BEST OF MISSING PERSONS...
4,This album is a gem.,"An excellant collection from one of the 80's most underrated bands.This cd contains a fine blend of ballads[Take My Breath Away],rockers[Blowin Sky High],and synth pop[Matter Of Time]to satisfy any musical taste.A must have for old fans and those who are tired of bland commercial groups[you know them!|that rule our airwaves today.Let Terri Nunn and co. into your ears,you wont be dissappointed.t"
5,No more words......,"This album is a great mix of Berlin, but my favorites are ""No more words"", ""You don't know, (my absolute Berlin favorite)"" & ""Masquerade"" all of them are very different. Terri Nunn had an excellent voice & still does! This album & Fleetwood Mac's ""Mirage"" are my favorites!"
1,acorralada,"Again i am very upset with amazon's false advertising, why do you keep putting up that this has english subtitles, when that is not the case, please stop putting out these dvds when you know that this is not the case."
2,"Good Movie, NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES","Do not be fooled by amazon's insistence that this has english subtitles. i ignored other reviews which said that it didn't, thinking that surely the description would have been updated by then. however, as of Nov 29, 2010, there are still no English subtitles for Acorralada.I did enjoy the show, though. My spanish is passable enough to get the gist of what was going on; and, let's face it, it's a soap opera, the plotlines aren't terribly deep. Even if they were to start with, the amount of cutting that happened to get this down to 10 hours makes the whole thing one big romp from bedroom to bedroom. But it is really fun, more so when - SPOILER ALERT - you get to the end and see the creative ways each of the ""bad guys"" gets his or her comeuppance."
1,Horrible,"the movie was in a good condition but the movie sucks, the movie is not scratched but it always freezes and stops in random times."
1,Wrong label,"It says it is accoralada which is a completely different soap. This is actually a movie. Don't waste your money if you are thinking of one of your favorite spanish soap, beause this is not it."
4,This is ok not great just ok,"For the history enthusiasts and educational folks out there this DVD is for you. However, if you are the average person that knows some facts about the lost cities, such as Pompeii near Rome you might want to pass on this one. But you can't beat the price if you are looking to add to your collective historical library. The documentaries were done back in the 1990's but there is good educational information here for the taking. I was familiar with most of the cities mention, but I was able to pick up some interesting pieces of information. I still find the discussion on the Forbidden City and its colorful history worth revisiting and even though I had heard about Port Royal - lost city of pirates I didn't know it was in Jamaica. All in all I would recommend this DVD for those looking for a little more information on the subject matter or someone who does not know anything about the cities."
5,A must for every child in school,"I have the soft cover version. This book tells what US History books have never told or taught children in school. Should be a school book. Very entaled with what really happened with the lives of Native Americans, and why the white man put them on reservations and today still takes their land away!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Works best with one pc only.,"I have a linksys router hooked up to a Power Line Bridge and on the other end another PLB hooked up to a PC. It works just fine. The problem is when I add a second PLB/PC. Sometimes it works for a while and then the line drops and sometimes it doesn't work at all. For some reason, the IP addressing goes off when adding a second (or third) unit. So I am constantly resetting the router, cutting the power, disabling and enabling the PC LAN connection to manipulate them into working again. Frankly, as you can see, it's driving me up the wall. I'm starting to debate laying cable under my house (wireless isn't an option because I use 2.4 gig. telephones.Like I said, with only one PC, the system is flawless."
1,Not Like Other Linksys Products,"I purchased this and the USB PLUSB10 to set up a home powerline network. Plain and simply, it sucked. Everything else I have is Linksys (router, wireless B and wireless B+G). I had no problem working the listed items together and wanted to add Powerline. The Powerline items couldn't see each other and the setup instructions didn't tell you what components you needed to make the system work. I bought the NetGear Powerline products. They arrived and worked fine with full instructions. I'd go NetGear in this case..."
5,Great product for the purpose it's intend to be used.,"I read the reviews of this product prior to me buying it. One or two of them raised some concerns, but I obviously ordered it anyway.My experience... Installed in a snap, just follow the directions (don't use it through a power strip, UPS, etc.) & it only took 60 seconds to get it working. It came with a utility with a few tools. One particular tool that I liked is that it shows signal quality/strength just like a 802.11b connection. The prodcut claims ""14mb Max"" throughput. According to this tool I'm getting 9.5mb with excellent signal quality (about 80-85%).Overall... The product works excellent for what it was designed for, i.e. low speed LAN connection. It certainly does not have near the performance of a 100mb LAN."
2,"Does the job, but poorly","It works as advertised but it needs to be reset frequently - unplug, plug in, unplug, plug in, after owning it for a few months (probably when the warenty expires :-) ). Can get to be a major pain."
3,Get the Trendnet TPL-102E instead,"We have 4 Linksys PLEBR10's in our house and have used them for a number of years with mixed results. One of the Linksys PLEBR10's went bad so we needed to replace it. There's only a one year warranty. After doing some shopping, we decided to go for the TRENDnet since it's half the price. We weren't sure it would work with the Linksys PLEBR10's but we gave it a shot owing to the price difference and the fact that the TRENDnet has a 3 year warranty. If worse came to worse, we would buy more TRENDnets. After the TRENDnet arrived we installed it and it worked with the Linksys PLEBR10's without a hitch. After using the TRENDnet for a few days, we're completely satisfied."
3,Hasn't worked for me yet,"As far as I can tell this only works with windows and it doesnt have much support documentation. I bought one to be able to run to my PS3 and I couldn't ever get it to work. I am no genius, but I consider myself pretty technical, and this was just not straightforward. Linksys, you can do better than this!"
5,"Answer to 1st reviewer, An Electronics Fan",Hello. I think you are missing the idea behind the bridge. All the bridge does is send a signal using the house wiring. You need a USB Powerline adapter at the other end to plug into the wall socket and the other connector is the USB cable female that plugs into your PC. This essentially is a hard wired system and does not radiate anything. All it does is replace Cat 5 cable with house wiring (Romex) There is nothing wireless about it. Good luck.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,Had the product for 1 year including the USB adaptors and it was fine. Then the bridge just quits 2 days ago ...only 5 mths after the warranty expires and Linksys will do nothing to help replace the product. This makes my entire $400 investment in the network wortless.I like the powerline for its security but go with another company that takes more pride in its products and shows more concern for its customers.
3,ONLY WORKS WITH WINDOWS 98 2nd EDITION!,"Could not get drivers to load from CD or from Linksys website download to work with Windows 98 (1st Edition). Linksys info does not specify that. Had I known that before purchase, probably would have bought another brand (although I have had no problems with Linksys router.) When I finally got to talk to a ""senior technical person""; even with newest driver download and beta patch could still not get to work with Windows 98. Had to buy W98 SE CD-ROM from ebay. Now, the powerline network works fine. The least that Linksys owes us is an update as to the real operating system requirements for this hardware!"
4,Very Realistic,"I was searching for another manufacturer of pure nature sounds in addition to the ""Sounds of the Earth"" Series. I found this CD and others and the natural sounds here appear to be authentic and not in a loop you sometimes find on other environmental CD's. You get ""Stormy Skies,"" which is a casual thunderstorm with light rain - very relaxing - and ""Soothing Rain."" Both are 25 minutes in length and it'll be great to listen to when the skies turn gray but there is no hint of rain in the forecast."
3,9 inch stanless lid,"Think about it. Over 28 dollars for a simple lid!. Intrinsically, there is nothing in the lid that could cost anywhere that much. The price you are looking at is a result of very calculated marketing.In brief, they go for the high ground and try to convince every one that they have the best product going by pricing it higher than the closest competitor. Further they try to differientiate their product as much as possible and convince everyone that a lid is not a commodity item. Add a bit of snob appeal and there you have it!. Does it work? Yes, Good value? No."
5,Wildlife rehabber is enthused,"As a wildlife rehabilitator, I am picky about book on the subject. I was very impressed with Healers...the quality of information, the layout, and the fact that it is valuable for ALL ages....for anyone who cares about wildlife, wants to know what it is like to dedicate yourself to helping wildlife and what it takes in time, money, and skills, how to aquire those skills or just where to go for help when you find injured or orphaned wildlife...and when to just leave it alone. This is a book that should be in everyone's library."
2,VERY BASIC BOOK,"This is a very basic book written for the beginner and designed to be carried around in your ""pocket"". Chances are, if you know something of the Gaelic Language, you'll find many words that simply aren't listed in it. It's good as a ready reference anytime for the MOST COMMON words used, but it's far from complete."
5,"Thoughtful, moving, beautiful analysis of parental loss","I have read a lot of the modern literature on loss and grief. Surprisingly little of it deals with the loss, in adulthood, of one's parents, even though this is one of the most common and affecting experiences in adult life. Levy is a psychotherapist who uses both his own experiences and those of his therapy clients to illustrate his wise observations and conclusions about grieving the loss of one's parents. The book contains no notes or references; it is more like an extended personal essay than a scientific treatise. But I found it useful both scientifically and personally. Each chapter begins with a moving poem about the loss and memory of a poet's parent. The book itself often has the effect of deep poetry, evoking not just ideas and experiences but powerful, sometimes unexpected, emotions."
5,Really valuable book,"I read this book two months ago, and it's stayed with me ever since. Levy is a generous, smart, wry, and compassionate guide through the experience of losing a parent. I especially liked how he didn't judge people's outer-limit experiences--stumbling upon roses, a traditional birthday gift their parent, on their birthday, after the parent had died. This is an important, thoughtful book. I can't wait to see what the author does next."
5,This book helped me tremendously,"I thought that the loss of my Mom would be more or less the same impact as losing my Dad 7 years earlier. WRONG. I did not understand how hard I would bump into my own mortality. I also underestimated how losing the only person left that I had known (and had known me) my ENTIRE life, from the moment I was born, would impact me. Like a ton of bricks it hit me. This book helped me with a light touch and helped me to understand much of the weird turmoil I was and am still experiencing. Much as anyone else says ""I know exactly what you're going thru"", unless they've lost BOTH parents, they don't quite get it. I know I didn't before it happened to me. If you're newly orphaned, read this book."
5,Review,"I am not an orphaned adult. My mother has passed but my father is still alive. I do not have a relationship with my father therefore I do feel ""orphaned"". I thought it was strange that I had such a hard time dealing with the one year anniversary of my mothers death. I purchased this book on a whim. This book started me on my road to recovery. I like how it explains that we all need to find a new identity after such a devastating loss. I would recommend this book to anyone who has lost a parent. My sisters will be getting a copy once our father passes."
2,Probably the same person who took the cookie from the cookie jar...,"One of the reviewers on Amazon.com I think correctly described this book as ""bathroom reading."" I agree wholeheartedly. The book reads like an encyclopedia more than anything else, and it's not recommended to read it in large sections (like I did) because you'll be bored quickly. Apparently its part of a series, and this one focused exclusively on language (Where did the term Peeping Tom come from? What does it mean to mind your Ps & Qs?, etc). I suppose if I read a few explanations every day while in the bathroom the novelty wouldn't have wore off so quickly. Probably a good bet for those word-lovers more than anyone else."
3,"Ok for the price,no dramatic results",It is ok for the price but the chages in my color were subtle and my teeth were not too bad.
5,A wealth of valuable information,"Anyone intending to do any amount of hiking in Utah, whether it be for a day or an overnight trip, will find David Days' ""Utah's Favorite Hiking Trails"" an invaluable source of information! The layout and design of the book aids in pre-trip planning. Included are detailed trail maps for each hike, an extensive index, a rating of each hike by the author and a clear and definitive description of the route of the trail. Along with the maps and numerous black and white pictures, the author includes two multi-page groups of color photographs of the areas listed in the Guide. My wife and I found these to be very motivational and inspiring and are looking forward to our return trip to Utah to visit many of the areas Mr. Day lists in his book. I have seen and used many trail guides over the years and find ""Utah's Favorite Hiking Trails"" to be among the best and would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to Utah."
2,Bad Maps,"I've used this book extensively for climbing Utah trails. Though the book contains rich content, I would have expected it to include more information about alternative routes. For example, it only includes information on one (the longest) route up Mt. Nebo.Secondly, the maps are inaccurate. I'm a seasoned climber and found the maps for Nebo and Kings Peak to not be accurate and not drawn to scale. We ended up getting lost on Kings as a result of using his maps.Overall, the book is pretty good and perhaps the best available on the market. However, the map accuracy leaves a lot to be desired."
5,After 20 yrs ....,"I've waited 20 yrs to read this book. After doing a search online one night, I discovered that Ms Gregorian did indeed write the 3rd and final book. Very sad to also read that she died soon after it was published. The book was worth the wait. A bit different than the first two books but ended on a good note."
5,Pilots- satisfy your curiousity! These are great reviews!,"Just as flying magazines review the latest twins, this is a 'you are there' kind of book.Organized to convey the standard specs- takeoff distance, range, armament, etc, Brown has includedplenty of photos, and a rich narrative. Did you know the Germans used propeller controls modeledon the face of a clock? I was also intrigued by Brown's experiences with German aviators beforeand after the conflict. He must have led a fascinating life. Every scholar needs a copy of thisbook beside him when reading anything about World War II Luftwaffe operations."
2,Umm.....this isn't hi-rez lol,"The first review is from the company, same thing you'll read when buying one on ebay.Its good for about 30$ but not any more than that. The image quality is pretty terrible, but again, for 30$ your not getting a lilliput TFT.Flickering is very poor and noise from the inverter can be a problem. The ones made specifically for the game consoles by joytech and logitech are better but they aren't under 100$ either.But saying this is a high resolution lcd is just laughable. Sound is good though!"
5,MAW Rule!!!,"Yes MAW ""FINALLY"" came out with a live disc that their fans can enjoy ""BUT"" the one thing i have a problem with is the ""Bonus TracK"" and supposedly new The Longest Night. A long time MAW fan would realize that this song was also on a MTV concert featuring MAW in the early 80's. Otherwise it is a great disc!!!!! It's just too bad we'll never see the original line-up again as i feel they had so much more to offer, but at least we have this great offering to keep us satisfied....."
2,Oh how the mighty have fallen...,"This disc marks the point where Aerosmith made their career re-defining comeback. It also marks the point where they descended into MTV/Hollywood inspired mediocrity. Aerosmith is often compared to the Rolling Stones, and just like Mick and Keith and company, Aerosmith lost the hard edge. New Aerosmith fans often say this is their best, and the band has pandered to them in that everything they have released since is basically a rehash of this disc. Power ballads, Alicia Silverstone (where is she now?), jamming with Britney Spears? What happened to the 70's glory days when Aerosmith rivaled Led Zeppelin? One exception on this record: ""Hangman's Jury"" sounds like it could have been on ""Rocks."""
3,70s' Aerosmith was better.,Producer changed from this album. From this album Aerosmith became just noisy pop band. I stopped buying Aerosmith.
3,not bad just mediocre...again !,"""I'm Down"" is a fine Beatles cover.You already know what the hits were.This is Aerosmith as we must learn to like it.Since the release of ""Big Ones"" you no longer need to own this album.Do you want my copy ? I'm not using it anymore."
5,"The first of the ""new"" Aerosmith albums.","This is where they made their comeback. With this album, Aerosmith stood up and said, ""We're back and we ain't goin' anywhere anytime soon!!!"" Songs like DUDE (LOOKS LIKE A LADY) (which, btw, I heard Tyler was influenced to write after seeing Motley Crue's Vince Neil in a bar) and ANGEL establish Aerosmith as a true rock band. Their blues roots can be seen in such awesomely unique songs as ST. JOHN and HANGMAN JURY. Their unique flavor also comes through on such tracks as HEART'S DONE TIME, RAG DOLL, and SIMORIAH.I always have a hard time deciding whether this or PUMP is the best of the ""new"" Aerosmith. I guess it doesn't really matter because you'll want to get both. This is one of the best rock albums of all time."
4,"Better than their ""hits"" collection.","Of all their albums, including ""The Ultimate Collection"", this debut is the one ""Edie Brickell"" cd to have. Song for song it's the best. Besides the big hit ""What I Am"" being on here, it also includes ""Circle"", ""Love Like We Do"", ""She"", and the bonus track ""I Do"". I think anyone would enjoy this, even those who normally wouldn't listen to happy hippie pop music, like myself. You can just see her spinning around in the grass singing when you listen to this. For those interested, she also has a 2003 solo release called ""Volcano"", and she's still as cute as she sounds."
5,The Best new bos cd next to the live montauk sessions,"I love this CD. Too bad they are now recording and releasing records on their own label, the last record, the live montauk sessions (summer 2000) is not available on this site, but hopefully it soon will be. check out the bos web page at bodyofwater.com/edie"
5,Can't even give it away,"An old boyfriend left this at my apartment, then we broke up. I can't get rid of the damn thing. I tried to sell it at a garage sale for fifty cents and no one would take it. I tried to give it away and couldn't. ""What I Am"" is good but the rest doesn't sound as good and lyrics are lame."
1,Don't Believe the Hype!,"I never cared for ""What I Am,"" the only song I'd heard by her. But it seems like everywhere I go, I'm reading or hearing about how good this album is, and how talented she is. I had a good friend tell me that ""What I Am"" was actually the weakest song on the album, and the rest was great stuff.I finally tried it and I gotta say... SHE SUCKS!! Every track after the first famous one sounds exactly the same, with her whining, flat voice grating in the exact same way. I've heard cats that sang better than this woman.Ebay is my friend. This CD is no longer in my house."
3,"Hippy, Drippy Folk Rock","Edie Brickell and Company recorded one hit song ""What I Am"" which burst forth from the late 1980s college rock scene onto the pop charts and became inescapable on the radio. It's also the tune that kicks off their debut album, the appropriately titled ""Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars,"" interesting now as an occasionally catchy period piece. Brickell could be annoying as both a singer and a songwriter, but she followed up the hit with a few other decent tunes, including ""Little Miss S"" and ""Love Like We Do."" Elsewhere she comes off as an underage hippie relic who would have been more at home recording twenty years earlier.Overall, ""Rubberbands"" is interesting as a one hit rock period piece from the long gone college rock era."
3,And missing every one of them,"Edie Brickell seems to mean well enough, and so do the New Bohemians, so I don't want to be too hard on their multi-platinum debut. In her words, what she is what she is. In mine, her group's playing folk-rock by way of dream pop: the closer they get to the latter, the better they sound. They never sound better than the misty ""Air of December."" By the time the chorus hits ""Nothing,"" Ms. Brickell becomes the most obnoxious woman in the world, a title a person like her should never deserve. ""Circle"" is insipid, the defense of ""She"" irksome (""You can't judge her for that/She knows where her head is at""), ""Keep Coming Back"" pointless. It's what I'd expect when the album's mantra is ""Chuck me in the shallow water/Before I get too deep."" Smoothest line: ""I'm not aware of too many things/I know what I know if you know what I mean."""
3,Bias,"I am somewhat disappointed, but I haven't given it enough of a chance. The majority of the album is more bluegrass than rock, but that's an artistic liberty. Don't listen to me, I have hardly listened to it."
2,"good, but not the best",save your money and buy the single of I Will Wait.The first two releases are much better.
1,Country Musicish.,The CD was and still is countryish. It will sell good; four years ago. You have issues if you like this music.
3,The Moby Grape of the 90's,"In 1967, Moby Grape released the best debut album of any of the bands of the era, then quickly fell apart. Their subsequent music was largely a shadow of what had gone before. Some thirty odd years later, Hootie and the Blowfish seem to be travelling down that same road. ""Cracked Rear View"" was an album for the ages, which had the ability to restore one's faith in the power of good ol' rock and roll, with songs that leapt out of the speakers. ""Fairweather Johnson"" had only one such song: ""Old Man & Me"". Alas, ""Musical Chairs"" has none! The CD is competent and listenable, but this is generic Hootie, as faceless as ""Cracked Rear View"" was brilliant. A future that once seemed bright now seems ordinary. Rock bands that do not learn from the mistakes of history are condemned, it seems, to repeat them."
2,I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED!!!,"I bought their new CD thinking is was going to be another hit. But, sadly enough, it just sucked. Is it just me or did all of a sudden they turned country??!!! It's like almost every song, they DIDN'T have any drums or base. It's a whole different Hootie from last year!"
3,"""I WILL WAIT""","YOU know I can say one thing, ""I will wait"" is an amazing song with a awesome beat, but the other songs are just lacking the hype and enthusiasm that they have in ""Cracked Rear View"". Have you ever noticed that they sing like people should give them a chance and that their on top of the world in cracked rear view? But in this one they do in like three songs, and they're all good, but this cd is missing the beats and great songs. I personnally hold all three of their cd's and I like them but none I stand out like ""cracked rear view""."
4,"""I Will Wait"" was worth buying the entire album.","A song people haven't mentioned in the comments so far, I believe, is ""Answer Man."" Hootie addresses a lot of great and important issues of life and relationships, and this song really hit home for me. This CD might be their best yet. ""Las Vegas Nights"" was also very smooth and memorable."
5,Great sound and understandable vocals by Darius Rucker,Nice balance of speed guitar (pumping sound)... country twang (unplugged feal)... and slow songs. A must have disc!
3,Classic Hootie with more,"I absolutely fell in love with Hootie after their first album. I still think ""CRV"" is the best in the ""trilogy"" so far. ""FWJ"", despite ""lagging"" sales was still classic Hootie fare. With ""Musical Chairs"", Hootie successfully retains their signature sound (I love Darius' voice!) while delving deeper into the more bluesy/country-like genre. Some of the songs were a little too country sounding for me, but Bluesy Revolution is my personal favorite. Though they may not have as large a chance at the success they had with ""CRV"", as long as they keep ""their sound"", they'll have a loyal fan base."
5,This is perfect,"This is a truly worthwhile c.d. I have this and Fairweather Johnson and though I love them both, i definitely listen to this one the most. The songs are deep and meaningful, the sound is rich and lovely and altogether it is a wonderful c.d. I especially like the hidden track, number fifteen."
3,Pretty good,"This cd is not as good as cracked review. The first five songs are Great, but the others just aren't the same. It is too much of a southern sound, not at all like their last album. It is still a good cd though. Onely Lonely is a very touching song worth buying the whole cd for."
3,The Thrill is Gone :-(,"I first heard Hootie and the Blowfish in Germany. I saw them at the same bar where the beatles hit it big. What a party! They were great!!! Unfortunately, ""Musical Chairs"" doesn't deliver. Somewhere along the line, success watered down the passion that made them great. Buy ""Musical Chairs"" if you love Hootie, but if you don't have any of their disks yet start with the earlier releases. -- VVJ"
3,It's no Kootchypop,"The guys always manage to bring back wonderful memories of my college days in Charleston, but they're letting the label take away their unique sound. What happened to the emotional lyrics and hard-charging riffs I heard at the Windjammer and Music Farm? If you didn't know them then, you best skip this one."
5,musical chairs,"this is hootie & the blowfish's third studio album, i read some bad reviews & then i heard it & it is great i love 10 track out of 13, my favorite song is the bonus track ""closet full of fear"" & ""blusey revolution"" , i like ""i will wait"" ""only lonely"" ""answer man"" ""michelle post"" ""home again"" ""whats going on here"", needless to say its another really good album."
4,"It's Felt, it's tape, and it works.","Well what can I say, it's felt tape. One side has excellent adhesion properties... And, on the other side felt... Nuff said."
2,Doesn't Stick,Every morning I'd wake up and my screen would be removed from the wall (partially) I tried sanding the wall down to get a better grip..nothing. I will say that they did send me two rolls and only charged me for one which was nice because I went through the first roll in about a week trying to keep this thing up. I eventually just stapled the screen to the wall put the tape over the edges and stapled the tape to the wall. I don't think you can really call it tape at that point.
2,Not sticky,"The back of the felt is barely sticky at parts. Had to use glue,, what gives ?? Otherwise nice felt"
2,Will not last for projection screen use.,This tape begins to peel of the screen surface after just a few days. Difficult to cut cleanly. Do not recommend.
4,4lb medicine ball,I bought 4 for our club for wrestling; Two were barely 3 lbs(3.2 and 3.6); the other two were 4.2 and 4.6. If you are not so worried about the weight then they are a good buy.
4,Great Value - Recommended by a Personal Trainer for the Price Range,"Been using this now for a year and a half. Recommended by a personal trainer as a great value for this price range.Electronic monochrome LCD panel to show distance, calories burn, time, pulse rate and built-in exercise programsNeed some assembly - around 20 minutesPrice when bought - less than 400$Pros:-Fantastic customer service. I had a chance to call customer service (Fitness Quest) when the LCD computer panel broke. There was no hassle during the call. They sent me another panel quick and at no cost to me.-Why spend 500$ or even 1000$ for ellipticals? This do the job for us as the expensive ones.-Easy to move. It has wheels and you do not need another person's help to move it around the house.-Not too bulky. Does not occupy a lot of footprint.-12 levels of resistance.Cons:-A bit squeaky-Does not feel as solid and heavy as the expensive brands."
2,Warranty is not long enough,"This trainer had worked great for a little under 2 years. While it was working it was a delight to use, and did the job well. However, the peg for the pedal that is attached to the wheel recently became loose, rendering the trainer virtually unusable.I called Fitness Quest, and since the 1 year warranty had expired, the only thing they offered me was a 20% discount on a new one. I am definitely looking elsewhere for my next trainer."
1,Two in a row broke - don't buy!,"Neither of the two models I had lasted more than a year with occasional use. Eventually the motor goes, meaning you have little resistance. The ""savings"" on this lower cost model are not worth it, and I feel bad about putting two big machines in the landfill."
4,Decent for the Money,"This is a decent elliptical machine for the money. I did a lot of research before I bought one, and this one seemed to have pretty positive feedback and the price was right, so I bought it. Luckily, I had a friend put it together for me, which wasn't a big production. It is a good workout and it's not noisy, either. Only one complaint thus far, and I've only used it several times so far, and that is that the heart rate monitor is way off. I use my own heart rate monitor which is much more accurate. But it's got a bunch of different programs to choose from as well as manaul and it's a workout -- which is what you're looking for, right!?"
1,This one is going back,"I ordered this product 6 weeks ago. I received it within 5 days. Once assembled, the motor did not work, so I called the manufacturer. I was told that they would ship a new elliptical within 7 to 10 days, at which time I was to return the original one to them. After a couple of weeks, I called the manufacturer again. I was then told that the item was backordered and that it would be another 1 to 2 weeks before I would receive it. After 3 weeks,I still haven't received it. Today I called the seller, not the manufacturer, and they are going to have the item picked up by UPS and refund my money."
2,Remember..,You get what you pay for. This elliptical lasted for about two years before it broke. I rode it just about every day for 30 +/- minutes. I really had a hard time aligning the main column so that the left/right steps function correctly. I will buy another elliptical but plan to upgrade.
2,Nice while it lasted...,"We've had this elliptical for a year and a half. In the first year, we had to have the computer replaced 3 times, which was covered under the 1-year warranty. The computer broke again a few months ago, so we could still use the machine but could not adjust resistance. Now one of the pedals is falling apart, making the machine unusable. We enjoyed using the elliptical - it had a smooth motion and was quiet, although it's not gym quality - but in our experience it was not reliable."
1,Was sent used/repackaged and non-functional product,The trainer I was sent was non-functional and had probably been returned by someone before me because the components didn't align well when assembled according to instructions. Amazon refunded the purchase amount and arranged pickup so no complaints there. However I spent more than two hours assembling it with great care before it turned out that the previous owner also had the same issue with the alignment (extensive scratch marks on the body exactly where the problem was). I hope they don't resend the same trainer to anyone else.
3,Could be good for men...,"This unit seems well built and sturdy, but though the action is very smooth, it hurts my knees. Because it is compact, which I wanted, the steps are spread apart on either side of the center plastic housing. This causes you to have to sort of ""jump"" from side to side as you work out. This apparently places a strain on my already damaged knees. I have tried out elipticals at sporting goods stores and will replace this one with a longer unit that has the housing behind the steps, so they are close together as you would normally walk."
4,Glad I purchased,"A treadmill was always my exercise equipment of choice until I developed a problem with my ankle. The constant pounding on a treadmill was causing me a great deal of pain. I had heard that the elliptical trainer could produce a good workout without putting stress on my joints. This is the perfect elliptical trainer for me. First I live in a small apartment and the Eclipse 1100 does not take up a lot of space. I am only 5 feet tall so I don't get ""swallowed"" up using this elliptical compared to other models. A friend of mine helped me to put it together and it was easy to do. Everything was well marked. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it does squeak a tad when using it. Other than that, very smooth operation. I am very happy with it and my ankle is doing much better. I probably get a better workout using the elliptical since it has 12 programs to use or just use the manual mode. Thanks..."
2,Has its limitations,"The Eclipse 1100 HR/A trainer is priced reasonably for a home use elliptical trainer, but I must say I was kind of disappointed in the performance of this trainer. I am fairly petite at 5' 4"", and found the pedals awkward and hard to work even at the lowest level of resistance. Even though it only has a 15"" reach, for me, I am maxed out at that stride length. And the arm bars squeak while using, even with all hardware tightened as much as possible. It's ok, but I think there's better out there. I've come to the conclusion it's important to first try an elliptical on for size before purchasing sight unseen."
5,"Great Elliptical, Great Price","My wife and I did some research to find the elliptical machine that would be good for us. We wanted one that was affordable ($500 or less), one that would not be too bulky but fit our living room, one that would be easy to assemble, and one that was solid, stable, and reliable.We found all of that to be true of the Eclipse 1100 HR. The price is hard to beat among those of similar quality. It fits perfectly on the side of our living room so we can watch TV while exercising. It only took about 30 minutes to assemble. It feels very solid and stable when we use it. It does rock very slightly, but I'm not sure if that's because our wooden floor is not even.You will not be sorry to purchase this elliptical machine."
3,Not a bad machine,"I bought this a couple of years ago for 300 something dollars and was shocked when I saw the price it is now, over 400. When I received it the ups guy was not really happy about bringing it upstairs since I used to live on the second floor. I felt really bad but I couldn't help since I am 5'2"" and had very young children at the time. I put it together myself which was not to bad. I loved how quiet it was to start. But a few weeks later it started to squeek really bad and the screws that were put in constantly loosen. After about 2 years the handle bars kind of move around but tightening the screws doensn't do anything.Really I don't use it, my brother does and he doesn't mind it so I guess if you can live with some noise and tightening the screws all the time it wouldn't be bad but I don't think I would find it a great buy at over 400 dollars."
1,Worst fitness machine I've ever owned,This is the second Eclipse I've owned - I returned the first one for the same problem that I now have with this machine. The nut that secures the rear peg to the disc separates after only a few months use. This is NOT repairable because the grommets etc. are destroyed in the process rendering the machine unusable. It is now a large paperweight.
3,ellipticals,could not find the eclipse online so I really can't rate it. I purchased a golds gym stride trainer 380 elliptical that I love
1,Wish I could use it!,"I was excited to use this product. Unfortunately, after 2 attempts at delivering me one that was not damaged, I gave up and still don't have an elliptical. I don't know if it came that way from the warehouse or the delivery service damaged it, but I guess be careful buying large products from Amazon. One good thing, the customer service was good and helpful in returning the product."
3,Great while it lasted,"I liked the smaller space saving size. It worked well for both me and my husband. But, as usual, it only lasted 3 years before it broke, just like the last one that I bought (different brand). I guess you get what you pay for when go for the lower priced equipment."
5,Eclipse 1100HR/A Elliptical Trainer,"We love the Eclipse 1100 HR/A Elliptical Trainer. We've had it for several weeks now and are well satisfied. This compact machine gives a big workout. For quite a few years we had an Eclipse 1000 HR elliptical trainer that finally gave out after many, many hours of use by several family members. We got our money's worth out of that one! Now, after researching the various elliptical trainer options on the web, we have returned to an Eclipse 1100 HR/A as the best value and most space-saving of the machines out there. It would be very difficult to beat the quality and sturdiness of this piece of equipment at this price point. The relatively short base does not occupy a large part of the room but still allows a reasonable stride length in a workout. This newer version has an improved monitor display and more versatility in the workout programs available. In a word, we are very happy with the Eclipse 1100 HR/A Elliptical Trainer."
2,"First one broke, replacement has now broken the same way","I take Amazon ratings into account when deciding to make a big purchase. After seeing a 4.5 star rating I felt pretty confident with this purchase.The first one I received broke after 2 months of occasional usage by my wife and I. (Both moderately fit). I went through the hassle of disassembling the first one and sending it back. Got the second one in the mail and it broke the same way within 3 weeks.I got the impression from Eclipse that this is a fairly common issue. The customer service rep knew exactly what I was talking about when I said ""The linkage below the foot platform has come loose"". Apparently there is no way to fix it and it requires a replacement by mail every time.Eclipse is happy to send me a third replacement machine. Fortunately Amazon has decided to offer me a refund as an alternative.If you buy this, keep the box because you'll probably have to send it back!Amazon - goodEclipse - bad"
5,a perfect book for fit people and readers,"what a terrific book. kybartas takes exercise out of the 'drudge' category of life and portrays it as the fulfilling component of a healthy, productive life that it really is. I couldn't wait to work out after reading this--it inspires."
3,Fluff and Stuff,"Madonna's personal fitness guru expounds on better living through fitness. This slick tome' done up in an oh-so-trendy veneer with it's multitude of b&w photos and spirituality talk is mostly all show. However, there is some basic info here for beginners that don't know where to start and even question whether they want to start.Nutritional goals, info on calculating BMI and Heart rate with comparison charts, sample endurance and weight resistance programs are here amongst the fluff and stuff. Oh, and you also get an introduction by Madonna, what more could you ask for?"
5,GREAT!!,"This is such a motivating and interesting book. I picked it up because I saw it reviewed somewhere and was interested in who made Madonna the way she is. What a surprise to find such a warm and caring individual (Ray Kybartas) behind all of it. I really enjoyed how he brought the whole religious aspect into everything, it made it much easier for me to understand. I hope to run into Ray someday on the beach in Santa Monica and tell him what and influence he has been!!"
3,Quick to the point !,"I thought the book was kind of interesting.Quick to the point with short descriptionsof each excercise. Also a brief section onnutrition. I enjoyed the book so much, Ifinished reading it in one afternoon."
2,Very Disappointed,"To start with, the book's titled is: ""Theory of creative thought: Based on the writings of Thomas Troward"" which led me to believe that this was an elucidation on Mr. Trowards philosophy. Instead, it's just a condensed compilation of several (if not all) of Mr. Trowards works.While I applaud Mr. Fowler on his intent for the book, and the work it took to do achieve it, I believe the title could've and should've been more accurate than what it is.Also, from my being a student of Mr. Troward, I would've appreciated an introduction or forward or something from Mr. Fowler introducing himself and his aim and intent for the book.Otherwise, for being a self-published book, the quality of the book itself is commendable. I wish all independently published books where of such a high quality.Any comments on my review from Mr. Fowler are greatly appreciated."
3,Great shows but poorly restored.,"These shows are great. The comedy is well written and ageless. It is stated as these episodes are ""restored"". I know the films are 60 years old but I think they could have done a better job at restoring the quality of the picture and sound.How can I say this? These lost episodes are also aired on channel 20 in Phoenix. We have watched them on television and I think the picture and sound quality of the episodes on television is better than the so called ""remastered"" DVD's.But, all in all, the DVD's allow you to enjoy the shows time after time."
2,"No Color No Way, Will only buy Colorized Versions","Notice they show a nice color picture on the cover? Of course the set is all dreary drab b/w, not the beautiful color you see on the cover. I will only buy this set if they colorize it. Colorization done with today's modern technology can make it look like it was originally shot in color. Refuse to buy until it's colorized."
5,Perfect Set!,"I got a set of ""Lost Episodes"" a long time ago. It's nice but does not have every episode, and contains a lot of commentary. This set is supposed to be complete and restored, so I can't wait to get it. As far as colorization, it would be nice but there is no way that is going to stop me from buying this set. I'm a true Honeymooners fan and this is a must have.-----UPDATE----- I finally received my set and I love it! Thanks to MPI Home Video and Jackie Gleason Enterprises for releasing this, and thanks to the UCLA Film & Television Archive for the restoration. Excellent job! [On a side note, I would like to know why Amazon had to pause selling this, what exactly are the complaints, because I can't find anything wrong with my set.]"
1,Buy a different book.,"Yeah, OK, maybe it's only supposed to be a coffee table book, but that's no excuse for the poor layout, repetition, and editing errors... Surely you can find a better book than this."
4,U2 of the US,"Its been awhile since I've heard something good and refreashingly different then all the other power chord infested American bands today. I myself I'm a big Radiohead fan, but I don't see too many characteristics between them. I think they sound alot like U2 and a little bit of Queen. With songs like Prophecy, Hermes Bird, Gramarye, Motorcycle, and Fair this really surpasses Alternative/Pop rock stantards of American Bands. The surpising part of that this group formed in Birmingham, not in San Fran. or Seattle. Look for Remy Zero to surface pass the collage seen this year with this album. I would of given them a 5 but unless introduction to some songs and their ownly being 11 songs."
5,The best album of 1998,"I've been a long time band of Remy Zero ever since I heard them at City Stages in Birmingham in 1997. Villa Elaine is most probably the best album I have ever encountered. The lyrics, guitar, and overall musical score are amazing. I've heard everyone compare them to radiohead, U2, Queen, and others, but I feel like RZ has a style all it's own. I haven't been able to take this cd out of my player since I've bought it, and I've told everyone I know about this amazing band. They're sure to be legends of their time. I was blessed to be able to hear them live in Dallas, TX at Deep Ellum Live with Semisonic. They are the most energetic, emotional, and gripping artists I have ever encountered. Buy this cd and you'll be perpetually satisfied."
4,Something different,"They are not British. They are from Birmingham, AL. A bit like Radiohead, but with less guitars (and Cinjun's voice isn't quite as lovely as Thom Yorke's). Still, this a great CD. Interesting layers of weird sounds and great melodies."
4,Goodbye Little World,"Beautiful album. I think everything has been said about it in previous reviews but i just wish for tell anyone who compares them distincly to Radiohead to listen again, they are not nearly as dark and tend to prefer to keep a lighten tone as show perfectly in ""Goodbye Little World"".Also would wish a goodbye to a very impressive band and wish them all well in their endevours. Goodbye from Scotland."
3,A little disappointing,"I have to say that after reading superlative reviews of this album and listening to the stunning ""fair"" I was looking forward to this album. I have to say that I was dissapointed. Apart from ""fair"" and ""prophecy"" there is little that stands out. The rest of the album steers a confident MOR rock course, taking in elements of Queen and especially REM along the way. If this is what you are after then fine but for a band that I have seen touted as ""the future of rock 'n roll"" it is simply not enough."
5,finally found,"all of the stars coming down...this is one of my favorite albums of all time.if you haven't heard it, gotten it, tasted it... you should. my favorite tracks are hermes bird, life in rain, hollow,and fair.i'd recommend this album, and all of the other ones to anyone who's feeling up or down or all around.. because it's music for everyone's soul.so.that being said, get to it. go. now.listen.and feel like the sun."
4,Mellow goodness,"This is the first Remy Zero CD I've ever owned and it gets better every time I listen to it. The lyrics and music are like nothing I've ever heard before; though ""Goodbye Little World"" is very Beatle-esque. ""Gramarye"" has this rising chorus that hooks you immediately. And ""Fair,"" a song that is slowly growing on me, could make a baby cry. Ok, so that's not really impressive, but it is a sad song. Overall an excellent CD. I look forward to hearing their new CD, Golden Hum."
3,"slick production, but little heart","i bought this cd based upon hearing the song ""life in rain"", which i thought was beautifully written and had great production. the rest of the cd does not live up. it seems like a lot of the same song and production ideas are recycled. that's not to say that there aren't some strong standout moments, but do yourself a favor and put your money toward that radiohead import you've been wanting."
3,Just Another 15 Second Flash Radio Band,"Radiohead? How obvious....listen and imagine if Ozzy Osbourne and Geddy Lee (Rush) were fused into today's melodic punk/alternative scene.....it would sound pretty cool huh? Song #2.""Prophecy"" will be all over the U.S. in two months...even the kids in Peoria, Ill. will be deifying that song. Unfortunately, due to today's streamlined and inelastic music business...Remy Zero will go the way of last month's flavor Harvey Danger. Don't get me wrong..I think Remy Zero has a hot sound...and may even be a harbinger for the next ""L.A. Sunset Blvd. Music Wave""...but overall the album sounds a lot like everything else ""new and cool"" coming your way. But please look beyond the Radiohead comparisons for a more chic echo of yesterday's metal influences."
2,"Sorry, but one of the more overrated CD's I own","I'm a huge music fan, own about 500 discs, and am constantly on the lookout for under-appreciated bands that get no airplay. I have listened to this disc repeatedly and it simply does not gel for me. The elements are all there, but it just doesn't have that certain intangible that makes it a great record. It has received great critical acclaim as well as a consenus 4-5 star pick on this board.My sense is that Remy Zero is trying to do Radiohead. I read where Thom Yorke was somewhat influenced / liked their first record. But the problem with trying to be Radiohead is simple: there is nobody who can be Radiohead but Radiohead themselves."
1,Hype Hype Hype,"How boring is this? Is this all a band needs to do these days, record songs in the style of really good bands? Not that I have a problem with that but at least those band injects a little of their personality into the music they make. Remy Zero fails to do that to the ""music"" they make. This is CD is poorly written and it sounds like different artists that we all know and love. I would compare this to a deodorant that has a sticker on it that says if you like Right Guard then you will love Special Squeeze! Remy Zero is nothing more than overblown hype. Avoid at all costs."
4,Fun Toy,"We bought this for a friend's son but my daughter (8 months old) got a hold of it while I was wrapping other gifts. She has a great time with this toy. She likes to turn the wheel and hear Elmo, prees the blinker (cookie cookie) and 'shift gears' (vroooommmm). I still haven't wrapped it...."
1,Extremely loud -- it will cause your child to suffer hearing loss,"This toy is EXTREMELY LOUD. It is really not suitable for children. Prolonged play will cause hearing loss. There's really no educational value in this toy although it is a fun toy. It's just not safe for kids. I threw mine, a gift, in the garbage can. There's no way I would even donate it because I don't want to hurt children who receive this poorly engineered toy secondhand."
2,Not for age indicated,"Good quality, cute sounds, but my son got fed up within the day. More for 2 and under. Perhaps even 1 and a half maximum."
3,Loud but entertaining,"My 20 month old loves this toy! It keep her entertained, but it is loud! Hard to have a conversation if she is playing with it in the same room as you. She can easily work all the buttons and loves all the sounds it makes."
4,"""All Garbage, Alll the Time!!!""","My 16 month old son isn't into this so much, he likes to sit in his carseat and just reach a hand over...and hold down the ""radio"" buttons, which is Oscar saying ""all Garbage, ALL the time"" and then some music.Over. And Over. And Over.I'm not yet at my limit of noisy toys, I'm coping, and I still give him this thing, but whooooaaaa, that gets annoying quick! I eventually start looking for a good hard right turn that will toss it out of his reach!"
1,"Ridiculously loud, no volume control","This toy is painfully loud, and there's no way to adjust the volume.If your child will be playing with it outdoors or something silly like that, then it's decent. The sound effects and phrases are amusing, and there's lots of different interactions (push, pull, twist, turn, etc).Indoors, however, it's just too loud, even for adults (children generally have better hearing than adults, so if it's loud to us, it's even louder to them)."
4,Very enjoyable all the way through.,"For the price of a used copy of this album on CD, you can buy a well preserved vinyl copy and a USB equipped turntable to play it on!Well, I've already got a high-end turntable, so I found a new copy on vinyl for a little over ten dollars and gave it a spin. Yup, it's a very good album indeed; a prime example of that 80's era Kim Carnes rock style. No big hit's like ""More Love"" or ""Bette Davis Eyes"", but some catchy and beautiful tunes nevertheless.This album is certainly worth acquiring, but I would shop around a bit if you see used CDs selling for over a hundred bucks. You don't have to pay that to hear this album."
4,The Greatest Musical Of All Time - Yet Not The Best On Film,"The film is great, but not as good as seeing it live. I've seen this 7 times live, and I've seen this movie many, many times. BUT - the movie deletes many of the show's numbers - atleast 5, which takes away the fun from the soundtrack. ""Some Fun Now"" is just an embarrassing new rendition of ""Ya Never Know"" from the show. BUT - atleast the songs they have are performed excellent. Steve Martin does ""Dentist!"" great, and Levi Stubbs is excellent as Audrey II."
5,It's wonderful,It is a wonderful musical. It is the greatest. I love the rhythm and blues aspect of it.
3,Disappointing,"This isn't really the film soundtrack at all. Best I can tell it's a studio recording using most of the movie cast. Not only are some tracks vastly different than the film versions, there are tracks here not even included in the final film. That might sound good at first but because of these tracks, things like the Supper Time reprise are missing. Also, the sound quality is awful. There are times when you can barely hear certain singer (especially in The Meek Shall Inherit). Before you buy this CD, know that it's incomplete, poorly recorded, and different from the film. It does have the movie cast though, so if that's what you're after then this is the CD for you."
4,Fun!,"I love this movie, but I prefer the broadway version. It's the same price, but with more songs and longer versions. Sometime the audio's a little fuzzy, too."
2,Many Pros and Cons,"First off i have to say that i absolutely LOVE Little Shop of Horrors, the play. Though i thought the movie soundtrack was pretty good but it was missing a few things. First of all Little Shop the movie is supposed to be looked at more in a movie sense then by the great vocals, meaning it is a lot smarter to buy the movie and see a good movie with mediocre singers than by a CD of just mediocre singers. However i did quite like Rick Morannis even though i liked Lee Wilkof better (from Broadway.) Also i thought Ellen Greene in the movie was annoying and hard to understand whereas on the Broadway CD i thought she sounded quite good. All in all i think Little Shop shoulde be looked at for the movie not the soundtrack."
1,Damaged,"I bought this cd brand new, took it out of all the wrappings and put it in my cd player. I played the first few songs and then it started skipping resulting in an ""error"" message on my cd player. When I removed the cd and flipped it over it had a glob of glue-like substance on it. I tried every possible method of removing it but it couldn't be removed. Unfortunately, Amazon's return policy states that cd returns must be unopened and still in their plastic wrap. So the cd is now unusable to me."
4,Good training device for runners,"I bought the Suunto T3 as an addition to my Garmin Forerunner 201. The heart rate monitor works well. I also added a footpod in order to get pace information. I used my T3 in 2 marathons so far. The heart rate monitor is very reliable and the pace information from the footpod helps to keep a steady pace and achieve goals. Setup and usage of the watch are very easy. I especially like the large display and the different screen options. I also wear this as my regular watch, since its appearance is better than most other training devices on the market.Cons: The glas seems to be very suseptible to sratching and should therefore be handled with care. Suunto's customer support is fast, but not always helpful."
3,"Good watch, bad quality crystal","This watch is a very excellent product with all the bells and whistles possibly needed to train at a higher level. My husband has not used it yet with any of the pods to get an even more accurate reading, but I have no doubt it will be an extra bonus to look forward to.My biggest complaint would be the quality of the watch crystal face. We had read other reviews for a different model of this same watch stating how fragile the glass is to scratches. We decided not to buy the other model for this reason, BUT not even 2 days into wearing this watch and there is already a noticeable scratch on the crystal. He has not even taken it to the gym yet. I can tell you there is no one more careful with the handle and care of watches than my husband. We are disappointed that for such a pricey ""superior"" sports watch Suunto could not make the crystal more scratch resistant especially considering this watch is to be worn by athletes during rigorous sports training."
3,Should be better,"This Suunto watch has a great feature: the training effect. Also, the HR Belt is very comfy, compared to the similar Polar ones. BUT I wish it was a little better. The alarms are not loud enough: if you train with intervalls, there no way you can know when you just passed one step. You just can't hear the alarm. Also, there is no possibility to store different exercise types. So the day after a long jog, if you decide to train with intervalls, you have to go through the complete set up. Too bad."
1,Terrible User Guide,"I returned the watch within 24 hours because I could not understand the user manual and coordinate set-up or on going functions . Also, tried calling customer support and was informed that they were experiencing long wait periods. Waited over 20 minutes, hung up and decided the watch was not for me."
1,I don't recommend this HR Monitor,I do not recommend this product. I have used several Polar Brand HR Monitors over the years and found them to be extremely beneficial for my training efforts. This product has been a problem from the start. I finally figured out that the battery in the chest strap was bad and replaced it. It is till showing clearly bad numbers for the Heart Rate. The watch is difficult to set up and the numbers are hard to read. Sadly I discarded the original packaging so I can't return it to Amazon and am forced to deal with Suunto's warranty program.
4,It's like a personal trainer...kind of,"I have used this watch for over 30 days and have done about 20 workouts with it. I bought the Suunto T3 to help me train for Go Vertical! in Chicago. The watch's heart rate monitor is excellent, as is the training effect feature which analyzes how hard/long you work out and shows you on a scale of 1 to 5 how challenging the workout is. It was a bit uncomfortable for me at first but now I have gotten used to it and it suits me well. My biggest complaint is that the face of the watch has scratches already. Albeit, I may be a little rugged on the watch I would wish a watch of this caliber had a face which is more resistant to scratches, so buy some protectant or shield for your watch!Overall, I highly recommend the watch. It is a very good tool to help you look at your prior workouts, analyze them and adapt future workouts to maximize goals. Great if you are training for an event and also good if you are trying to get in shape!"
1,Too many repairs,During the 2-year warranty period I had to send the watch and HR band in for repairs 3 times. 6 months after the warranty expired it stopped working again. Contacted Suunto support about the unreliability and all they did was quote a price for repair. Decided it was too unreliable to spend money for repairs so put the money into a different brand instead.
2,Very Disappointed,"I purchased the Suunto t3 because it indicated it could be used for swimming.""Your Sunnto t3 is water resistent up to 30m/100ft and the transmitter belt to20m/66ft according to ISO 2281 standard.""My primary use was to be for my swim training and it also has the Lap time so I thought it would be a useful training piece for my 'technical arsenol'.It does NOT track HR while in the pool - in fact, pretty much the second my chest was submerged, it lost contact.Returning product and going back to Polar!"
5,"17"" HP backpack case RU350AA","Just got it for Christmas and so far I love it. It takes my 17"" laptop and books no problem. Sturdiness seems good only time will tell. Just love not having to carry two bags."
4,Good Bag,Very good servicable bag. Took to Ecuador with me and it did great. I would recomend this bag to anybody looking. The only thing it does not have is a water bottle holder
4,"max. fit 16.4"" that's laptop,very nice","it is good & found that max. fit 16.4"" that my laptop have at total its best for least price & best quality for this sizes"
1,BEWARE - Fell apart in a few months,"I purchased this item as a gift for a family member. When it first came we loved it. It was the perfect size for a 17 inch laptop and had plenty of room for papers and a book or two without being too bulky. There are a bunch of pockets for storing mp3 players, etc.However, after less then 4 months of normal every-day use the shoulder strap is completely frayed and falling apart. It is still usable but it looks terrible - you can see the foam padding inside the strap. I'm really shocked that HP would put its name on a product of such poor quality."
1,Spend a Little More,"Looks great, convenient compartments, but the one attribute where it is woefully inadequate is DURABILITY. I bought this thinking I would have it for at least a year or two & the darn thing started coming apart after a few months of use. The shoulder strap began to unravel, foam cushion spilling out the side. I sometimes carry a lot of paper for work in addition to my laptop, & I do often carry it using only one strap but come on...I would expect it to hold together for at least a year! I am now shopping for a new laptop backpack & I am willing to spend a little more this time for durability - I hate buying cheap crap that doesn't last under normal use conditions. Cheers!"
2,Poor quality,"I just returned the second one of this exact model. The first I had to replace after about 6 months as both of the shoulder straps were severely frayed and the partition between two of the sections was coming unstitched from the outer shell. The second I return after just one month as one of the shoulder straps was faulty and tended to fold/twist when worn. Perhaps I shouldn't have purchased this a second time, but I has such a difficult time finding a pack that fit my computer I went with this because I knew it would fit."
2,Unexpected,"The quality, size and convenience of all the storage compartments met my expectations. However, the nylon straps that hold the shoulder straps unraveled and almost disintegrated before I managed to hold them together with Duct tape.Pretty strange how quickly they unraveled."
5,Wonderfully effective for tiny people as well.,"Holds a 17 in laptop snug but not tight. Also has enough pockets for a four class college schedule. Sturdy, with very comfortable shoulder straps that cinch just tight enough for a small woman to comfortably tote things around without fear of it falling off."
4,Nice,"Backpack is really nice. It can hold a lot of weight. As there are multiple compartments, its pretty nice and organized."
2,"Too small for 17"" laptop","Sent back and bought a Case brand. Will only hold a 15"" or smaller. Good back pack otherwise, if you need smaller one."
5,Fits My HP Envy Perfectly,Nice for traveling as it leaves your hamds free for other items when moving around the airport. Plenty of room for other goodies. Seems to be decent quality.
5,I love it,I am loving It.The earlier bag used to be bit heavy and so i checked for this and this was awesome. It perfectly suits my laptop and also have multiple racks to place my things and it does not look big as much as fit in.
4,Pretty good backpack,"In terms of its low price, the backpack is pretty good. It fit my MacBook Pro well, and a lot of space for another gadgets and a couple of books.I am satisfied with it.The only drawback is the side bag is too weak for a bottle, or a umbrella, that's I gave four stars instead of five."
5,Great Laptop backpack,"What's not to like about this bag??? Great product, lots of pockets, plenty of room for extras. I do agree with the other reviews that state that this bag is better suited for a 15.6"" laptop rather than the advertised 17"". While I'm sure it will accomodate a 17"", it works GREAT with my 15.6"" hp G62! This bag is sturdy and well made and I look forward to years of use from it."
3,good design but not very sturdy,"This is a very beautiful bag with plenty of storage space apart from a 17"" laptop. However I found its strength to bo average. IT stands nowhere infront of Swissgear's sturdyness."
1,ugly,ugly and smalli hope they tell you the capacirityreally dont buy thisi dont want to said nothing
2,"BARELY fits 17"" HP dv7 laptop","It's not a bad backpack for the money. Somewhat light, but well-enough stitched together. I'm not so fond of the mold green color, but that's no big deal. What IS a big deal is that this backpack is supposed to fit a 17"" laptop. I bought this especially for the new HP dv7 17"" laptop that I just got, and it just BARELY fits. You have to turn the notebook lid facing inwards and then really pull tight on the sides while you zip up the pack. Hopefully, the backpack will stretch with time. Technically, the laptop is a 17.3"" model (as are most '17""' laptops), so I have to cut HP a little slack."
1,Mine Doesn't Fit,"I bought this Backpack for the specific purpose of toting around my 17"" laptop. It specifically states that a 17"" Dell laptop will fit. Well, it doesn't. If you want to fight and squeeze and push it in then maybe you can get it in there. Certainly not something I want to deal with in an airport. Remember, when you check the dimensions on a backpack, consider that the top sides of the pack are usually rounded smaller than the total depth measurement. Laptops are square or rectangular, backpacks aren't."
3,good backpack not true 17in size,I bought this backpack for a 17in laptop and it would not work. I'm sure it is a great backpack but I can't imagine there is much of a difference between an HP and Dell 17in laptop. My Dell would not fit in the backpack.
4,Just the right size,I had a computer stolen in an airport so I decided to go with a backpack so I wouldn't have to set my new one down. My new computer is actually a little over 17 inches and it fits perfectly. The bag is also large enough to fit all the accessories plus a bag lunch.
5,great bag - heavy duty,"I've had this bag for months, it was at one point my everyday travel bag, i was able to carry all my video editing equipment. I can fit a 15 inch macbook pro along with a 17 inch pc, portable hard drives dvd player, case of dvds, and a few other things. This is one of my favorite bags. Its still going strong no rips or tears and it protects my computers. I've traveled planes, trains and automobiles with this bag and it still kicks.5 stars"
2,Almost too small,"The backpack seems to be adequately made. But, I have to stretch the edges around the HP 17"" laptop I have to get it in. The elastic retaining strap on the laptop compartment doesn't even stretch over computer. I think HP should at least make the backpack fit their own laptop computers they say the backpack was made to fit."
5,Perfect,"This is perfect and quite safe bag to keep my 17"" Laptop safe along with all the accessories, enought room to store everyhting."
4,17'' bag,For a 17'' bag inside should be deeper.. but it is well made and will last a really long time
3,Meh,"I didn't love this backpack.Pros: it was a great price, aesthetically pleasing, came very quickly.Cons: There at some design flaws that are a little irritating. The zipper for the textbook pocket is hard to get to and is hidden behind a rather useless flap. It is a very tall backpack so things fall to the bottom. It doesn't stand up on it's own which I didn't think I would mind but it is an extra consideration everytime I set it down. When I pick it up by the shoulder strap, the strap pulls out to it's full length and I have to readjust it. The juncture of the shoulder strap back into the bottom of the backpack is very flimsy and doesn't appear made to last. It also squeaks a bit when I walk.I would probably spend a little more for a backpack made by a company that focuses on backpacks."
1,"Small, no extras","If u have a large gaming laptop, thus is just too small, and theres no outside pockets for water or nothing. Lame bag."
3,Useable laptop back pack,"This is by no means a bad laptop bag but for the money, you could probably get something better by Targus or Swiss Gear. The bottle holder net seems a bit pointless because if you choose to use it, the pocket it is hidden in becomes unuseable. However, capacity is good without being over voluminous, so you don't fill it to the point where you cannot lift it. It does have some decent features including the cinch straps to reduce its size when not filled with stuff. I used it for a 16"" laptop and would be surprised if it was big enough for a 17"" model. The laptop compartment is reasonably well padded but don't expect this bag to protect your investment as well as an atache' style case. Quality seems pretty good but not up to the standard of Targus and Swiss Gear, both of which I have had in the past."
4,Muy bueno,"La verdad que el producto presta todo lo necesario para cargar la laptop, comodo al momento de llevar el equipo."
2,Not worth it,"Just ordered this back in June and had to return it in July as the back strap is beginning to fray.. Basically, this is a backpack made by Targus for HP. If you open it, it is fairly basic and I am not 100% if it is waterproof. I returned it as I discovered the strap issue beginning to develop within 2 weeks and Amazon was efficient in processing my retun. I bought an Adidas Chapman bag as a replacement. Far more comfortable and convenient."
4,Very valuable,"The product is very useful for students. It is very handy to carry your files , books and your laptop in this bag. It is very handy as it provide enough room to carry 2 text books and clip file, along with your laptop. It also has a separate section to hold your pens , mobile phones and wallets. It is really worth buying this bag."
3,quality,A good backpack for the price. Just looks like its going to fall apart. The arm straps are very flimsy and appear to be similar to backpack available at Walmart for fifteen dollars.
4,"Great backpack but VERY tight fit for a true 17""","The backpack overall is great, but is a VERY tight fit for my Sony Vaio AR730E 17"". To zip it up I have to force the material over the laptop corners with no room for cushioning from the top. The key factor is the amount of trim around the screen. If there is wide trim, it will be a very tight fit. If your laptop has a thin trim around the screen and/or the screen is a little less than a true 17"", it might not be so bad. As a side note, it works great for transporting smaller laptops as well as game system with a few games (PS3 for example). Nonetheless, if you're careful with it and don't allow the top to suffer impact, it works fine. I have had it over a year and no material defects yet."
4,Lots of room,"I bought 2 of these. One for myself and one for my husband. Our laptops are actually 17.3 inches so the laptops just fit. So if you have a 17.3 inch laptop - you might want to get a different backpack. But since we don't do a lot of traveling with our laptops this works just fine for us. You can fit all of your accessories in there (charger, power cord, mouse, etc.) It seems to be sturdy enough and we are enjoying the ability to travel with our laptops as needed."
2,Didn't Fit 17 Inch,I bought this for my son's 17 inch HP laptop and it doesn't fit. We were able to stretch the fabric over the laptop to make it zip but it was just too tight. He would not have been able to put anything else in the backpack because any additional space taken would not have allowed it to zip.
4,Great for 15'' Backpacks!,"After reading many reviews on many different backpacks, I decieded that a 17"" backpack for my 15.6"" laptop was a better idea. It fits PERFECTLY, by that I mean if my laptop was any bigger then it wouldn't fit in the pocket that HP has made for it. It's a great pack for 15""'s but I wouldn't suggest it for anything bigger."
2,Handles totally frayed,Nice bag except for the handles. In less then 6 months both handles have frayed so much that the foam padding is coming out. Too bad because the bag is nice but overall it s****!
1,"Barely Fits HP 17.3"" Laptops","I realize that it may be a bit my own fault that I did not know that my HP 17"" laptop is actually a 17.3"" laptop, but seeing as how all the HP 17"" laptops I've seen are actually 17.3"", I feel like HP is also a bit to blame for not creating a backpack that will comfortably fit it's own products in the specified size range.Otherwise, the bag is fine, but it really barely fits a 17.3"" HP laptop and would therefore not offer much protection at all if the bag with laptop crammed in it were dropped.I would strongly recommend you go seek out bags for a 17.3"" laptop if that's what you have."
3,Lasts for a short while,I have this backpack and use it to carry two laptops everyday to work and back. After 2 years the zippers started to pull away from the fabric and the shoulder straps started to fray apart. Great for one machine and not much added weight.
4,HP Backpack Case,"Very nice looking backpack, however doesn't have as many pockets as I would have liked, but that's just my opinion. Very functional."
1,Not as advertised.,"I purchased this backpack case to house my son's 17 inch laptop. I receved the item quickly, but then when we tried to put the 17 inch laptop in the backpack it wouldn't fit. It was about an inch to small. I had a 15.4 inch laptop which fit nicely. The low ratng is due to the backpack's inability to hold a 17 inch laptop as advertised."
1,not user friendly,"This looks like it would be good when you see it online, but when I received it, there was no padding or protection and for the price I found a cheaper one that I liked better. Sent this one back."
4,Pretty Good,"I had this for about 3 years. It worked well for my 17"" HP Inspiron laptop. I especially liked all the different pockets, side pockets, etc. It was very easy to use for travel (I was traveling by plan every week for work) and I could easily access all the spaces as needed (during security at airport for example). I finally got rid of it when I got rid of the laptop. Additionally, the right strap padding was getting shredded, though this was the only breakdown of the bag that I had in that three years. It would have have gotten a 5 star rating if not for the shred.I will note that for a couple of years, I was lugging 2 laptops at the same time in this bag (1 15 and 1 17"")"
3,Not quite big enough,"I bought a HP 17 inch laptop and was hoping that this backpack would work, but it is just a little too small. I really like it and if I had a smaller laptop it would be perfect, but I am going to have to return it. I think it is funny though that a 17 inch HP laptop does not fit in a 17 inch HP made backpack. I gave it 3 stars since it is a nicely made backpack with plenty of space and compartments for books and such, but I am sad it doesnt fit the one item I bought if specifically for."
5,All-Clad Stainless Professional Universal Steamer - A+,"This is a superb large steamer insert. It is great for large quantities of veggies or whatever you would like to steam. There is nothing like the flavor of freshly steamed veggies! It fits perfectly in the 6, 8, and 12 quart stock pots. I have only used it in the 6 and 8 quart stock pots myself. It is made very well and is excellent quality built to last. All Clad truly is lifetime cookware, I am sure you will not be disappointed. And it is backed by a lifetime warranty, what more can you ask for? Highly recommended! A+!"
4,Steamer insert,"I thought this product was made in the USA, it is not. Disappointed about that for the price. I'm keeping it, it works fine, but hope it lasts. Watch out on all clad, they are good at marking where it's made, but they do have two distinct manufacturers."
3,Not my favorite.,"I bought a jar of this ghee from the local Indian store and it didn't smell or taste good. I've found that ghee in tins or plastic containers don't have a good taste to them and often smell rancid. If you don't know much about ghee then you probably won't be missing anything, but it's better to buy a good quality product when it comes to food items. Try Taaza by Meghana Foods, Purity Farms, or Liquid Gold instead."
3,"Good look, runs small","Not the softest shirt, just a basic, gray t-shirt. Nice look to it with the stamped look. Only issue is that my shirt shrunk and is more like a medium now. I normally wear large, but should have purchased an XL for this one."
1,"Horrible service, item not as pictured!","This ring was shipped 4 days after being ordered, so the ""ships within 24 hours"" claim is patently false. I contacted the company about this, but received no reply. When I finally did get the item, a day after the last ""date of expected delivery,"" It was not as pictured, and I am really disappointed in the quality. I would send it back, but have just decided never to deal with this company again."
3,"Quick ship, ""OK"" quality, not exactly as pictured","Placed order but wasn't able to review or track it afterwards. Seller's Amazon name (Old Glory) not the same as emailed notification name (Red Rocket Merchandising Corporation). Items (2 rings) arrived quickly in a plastic envelope. Items not exactly as pictured and not comparable to my existing ring. Competitive pricing compared to retail stores but I guess ""you get what you pay for""."
1,Not pleased,This ring does not look as nice in this picture. The quality was very disappointing. I would never deal with company again!
3,large om ring,"this ring is just as advertised. however if you are a big & tall person like me, you should order this as a pinky ring and no other finger. i ordered this in a size 13 for my ring finger but the ""om"" symbol is just too small for my big fingers. i will either size down the ring i have to a pinky ring or order a second ring to fit my pinky which ever is cheaper. this is a very nice ring for the money. the ""om"" symbol itself is about 1/2 inch top to bottom. make sure to order the right size."
5,'Da Bomb!,"For those who want a natural way to wake up each morning, this CD is the one. The songs are so intense that this is the first CD(and sometimes, the only one)that I listen to each day. Wichy(Camacho)and Herman(Olivera)help set the mood. Try ""Cafe"", ""Donde Esta Mi Negra"", and ""Para Que Escuchen""."
1,Repeating the mistakes of others-the anti intellectual approach,"This book portrays nephrite as a virtually monochromatic(green) stone to make cute animal carvings from(ala Lyle Sopel) or to be displayed in a form not far removed from a monolith. For an alternative and highly instructive view read ""Jade Country"" by Theo Schoon, which outlines how this short sighted approach wasted much of the most beautiful jade in New Zealand. North American Nephrite is the geological equivalent of New Zealand's, and obviously is being handled by the industry in the same way as it was early on in New Zealand. Too bad!"
1,WORST COMPANY EVER!,"If i could give 0 stars I would. This company ""youremodel"" has the most unbelievably bad customer service. I wrote a comment on my review about how I felt the shipping was high at 10$ for an item that was only around 20$ and they wrote me back a very threating email, insulting me and telling me never to buy anything from their store again otherwise they would cancel my order. It angers me that Amazon has continued to support and host companies like this who use the comment boards to harass buyers rather than as a tool to learn how to please their customers.The towel bar itself is just okay. It's sturdy, however it doesn't hold my big fluffy towels well at all. It works well with thin small towels."
3,"Nice idea, but didn't work for my larger towels","I have limited space and was looking for something to use in each bathroom to store some towels. The product itself was good and sturdy...however, my towels didn't fit into the spaces. I had to really wiggle them into the spaces and then they hung out too much making it look messy. This is made for regular sized, thinner towels...nothing fluffy or for the larger bath towels."
3,Wall attachment not solid.,Overall does what it is intended for but the wall attachment is a little wobbly.
1,Towels do not fit slots.,I was thrilled to receive this item. I've wanted it for quite a while. But at this price? It's not possible to fit regular bath towels and hand towels into the slots. Now I have to hunt for a thinner towel product. This is not the item I've enjoyed in hotels past.
1,Beware,"This item is not what it is labeled as. This is disc 1 for the original series, not Outer Story!"
1,What's going on.,"I have had saturn for a while and I could not figure this game out for my life! There are some very good games out there (the virtual fighters, madden '97 and '98 just a few) but don't get this. I'm thinking about selling it. Oh yeah, SATURN RULES!!!!!"
3,Historical biography ?,"When I saw the comercial of this historical ""telenovela"" epic, I was very interested in watching it since I had finished reading various biographies of Emiliano Zapata. However, it began as a telenovela and had too many inaccuracies. Especially the way it showed that he was not interested in his wife, Josefa until she proved herself to him. In reality she was not into him, and her family never aproved of him because of their social standing,until he became General of the Rebel army did her family accept him into the family. All in all, if you want an accurate historical biography you must look into it yourself and come up with your own conclusions."
4,Interesting and exciting,"I did not know much about Zapata before I watched this movie. It is an exiting story about the revolutionary Zapata. The true story has been spiced up a bit by adding romance. I liked the movie a lot - 4,5 hours with good entertainment - ""telenovela"" style!"
4,Zapata: Amor en Rebeldia DVD,This is an entertaining film with authentic people and setting. The 4:3 picture is sharp and crystal clear. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles.
4,This is going to be a Top 40 Band!,After Listening to Lemon Yellow and Around the World I was blown away. This is a level of music that only a few bands have ever reached. The Beach Boys and Beatles if they were starting out in the 90's would sound like Plastiscene.
5,If you must have dailup this is the way to go portable.,"I can hardly believe broadband has not covered the US yet and so many still have to suffer with dialup. In the meantime, this is the way to go with laptop or notebooks. Get a power and phoneline surge protecter too. Mine blu-up and I had to replace it."
3,"fun, easy read",This was a most entertaining book. Just the right book to pick up and enjoy. Also gave a different slant on what it must be like to be a minister's wife! Really enjoyed it.
4,A Great Start,"Emilie Richards normally writes womens fiction books but with her newest release Blessed Is The Busybody, she took a detour and wrote a cozy mystery.Ed, the minister of the Consolidated Community Church, was concouling Jennifer, a young woman who was trying to work through some problems. Aggie, is the wife of Ed who happened to of found Jennifer dead on her doorstep right before a meeting of the churchs Womens Society.Not being able to let the murder go because she found Jennifer and because she is a straght forward kind of woman, Aggie starts her own investigation with her best friend Lucy. Between the two of them, they end up solving the case, but Aggie gets put in the line of fire and gets saved by the hot detective, Roussos.I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to learning more about Ed, Aggie, Lucy, Roussos, and a few other towns folks as the series continues in Let There Be Suspects, which is due out December 2006."
1,All-disappointing,"All-Clad's usual high quality and performance is missed with this highly disappointing colander insert. I have attempted to cook numerous pastas at varying temperatures and been frustrated every time. The water either boils over (regardless of water level in the pot) or just doesn't simmer. Ordinarily I'd blame my incompetence, but attempts by friends and family to better my performance with the pot returned similar results. I thoroughly enjoy cooking with the rest of my All-Clad collection, but have relegated the colander to the basement cupboard and pulled out the old, but reliable Reverware."
3,"Okay Book, Bad for CGI Programmers","I was able to learn basic PERL by using this book. If you are developing CGI applications, however, this book isn't going to teach you much about that. I had to buy another book on CGI for additional information.This book is a good reference and does a pretty good at teaching the basics. The web site I found useless. The quizzes aren't very useful in teaching you the language, and their are no answers to the programming challenges they give you.I haven't gone tried other Perl books, but I doubt this one is the best."
2,Very disappointing to new programmers,"The concept of this book was great. I looked forward to the quizzes and exercises in the book, to verify what I was going to learn. Unfortunately, there are too many typos to even count. Answers to quizzes were wrong, and code examples were inaccurate. The lack of the Waite Group's concern for the customer was evident when I called for a refund, and they were not even interested why I wanted to return the book. Too many careless mistakes leave a beginner even more confused. Not bad for a free ""beta"" version of a product, but completely unacceptable as a final release. Find a better book (and let me know when you do) Andy"
4,Miraculous!,"Jon Orwnat is the bestest Perl author ever. I learnded all the stuff I ever neededed to know about getting starteded in Perl from Perl 5. I have already recommendeded this book to much of my friend and now wants every boddy to know hows it good. Please write more of those, Mister Orwnat!"
3,Decent mystery imbedded in a rocky romance,"The suspense side of the story is engaging, but the romance between the two main characters seems forced - the immediate attraction Jesse feels for Kaia is almost obsessive when he should be concentrating on rescuing people rather than wondering if she is single. After our rocky introduction to Jesse's character, the relationship continues to develop in an unbelievably awkward fashion, even though the author incorporates many of the classic elements: boy meets girl, boy has conflict with girl, boy gets girl.I LOVED Colleen Coble's Alaska Twilight! This is one clever, and very funny writer! And the way she involves animals in her stories makes them even more appealing. I'm sorry that Distant Echoes didn't engage me the same way."
5,"Suspense, intrigue, and love all tied up on a sandy beach","Distant Echoes wraps you into a world of espionage, intrigue, and love set in the tropical paradise of Hawaii where the native culture conflicts with the Navy presence.Colleen Coble creates characters you can love including a dolphin that nearly steals the show. These characters struggle with political and social issues while at the same time worrying about their own jobs and families. Once I got started I could not set it down. I suggest reading this book in the morning."
5,Chef's Pan Excellence,"This beauty can cook up a feast!It has a large enough capacity for me to make a family-sized dish...all in one pot. While another critique says it does not replace a traditional Asian wok, it is called a ""chef's pan""-not ""inferior wok"" and it does a number of jobs incredibly well! I really like the Chef's pan for searing then sauteeing. It can simmer and is the right shape for reducing...I've made everything from browned sausage ribbolita to apricot chicken in this beauty. And, creating the fond-that essential for so many sauces-is a treat in the All-Clad Chef's Pan. Plus, it's made in America! What's not to like?As always with All-Clad, it cleans beautifully, simply, and looks amazing. If you want a wok, buy a wok, but if you want a chef's pan, this is the one!"
5,All Clad Chef's Pan,"We love All Clad products. I bought this pan for stir frying and it's perfect. Great size,cooks perfectly, easy to clean. What more could one ask."
5,Frip,"I read this story for a class and felt inspired to buy my own copy. It's a great, satirical story of the little town of Frip. It tells us that when change occurs, change must happen to keep the circle of life moving."
2,confusing,how many bars are included in this? no indication and I'm not going to pay $7.35 for 1 bar of soap.
4,D'Aulaires Book of Greek Myths,"This is a great book! My children and myself really enjoy reading the stories and looking at the pictures. I would have given it 5 stars, but half of the book is upside down. They accidentally put the index in the middle of the book. I had to go to the very last page to continue reading, which was put in upside down. I was wondering if anyone else had the same problem?"
5,"Wonderful book in childhood, now reading it again","This was one of my favorite books from childhood. I read it numerous times and am looking forward to reading it again now that I have another copy. However, I'm MOST eager to give it to my son and watch him read and enjoy it. Learning about the Greek Myths as a young person gave me a life-long appreciation of ancient history that still lives in my middle-aged brain. You won't regret buying this book."
5,Stands the test of time,"I checked this book out of the library so many times as a kid. Now that I have kids, I checked it out once to see if they were interested. They weren't! But a little later they started catching on, so I bought a copy and now we are wearing it out! I find the layout handy- it leads from one story to another by way of family relations. That's a great natural story telling style. I also find that it serves as a gentle way to alert soft hearted kids to the possibility of violence in this world. It raises issues about life and death and the humor in all of it. We can read or not read as it suits us, and we can discuss and digest and ask questions. The colors and pictures give pause for thought all by themselves. The stories are in better detail than any other myth book I had come across, but then I am biased here.It's great sharing reading with kids."
3,Infomrative but dull.,"We bought this book as a resource for a young adult novel which makes frequent references to greek myths, gods and goddesses. The good news is that it's comprehensive; whenever we turned to it, it always had the information we were seeking. But the stories are all told with dry monotony. We learn who was married to whom, their parentage and progeny but it all leaves you with the kind of enthusiasm you might feel while leafing through the yellow pages. These are BIG stories about big themes - stories that have been with us for centuries. Surely they can be conveyed with a little more verve."
4,Beautiful illustrations...,"But the text is lacking. I found it dry and facile at times. There were few explanations for why the gods would hate each other so much, other than the idea that they had to control the earth or the land in some way. This sets the basis for hierarchical systems of thought found in modern-day Greek society, long before the domination of the female gender took full force (around that time there was still a fair amount of female influence, archeological sources tell us) and ideates that we all need to look forward to future wars as a way of life.This is a nice, large volume, though. You'll like the drawings."
1,Defective product,"Book is fine up to page 160. Then it goes to an upside down page 192. In other words the book is put together incorrectly. I do not see anywhere to report this. I will not return the book as I live in Chile and the cost would be too high. However, I think other people should be aware of this defect."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A reasonably gentle and good introduction to Greek mythology, with some pictures to add to the entertainment. Here you get the stories of Zeus, of Athena and Apollo, not to mention Hercules and all the other gods and goddesses and the mortals and others that they chase, fall in love with, do bad things to or any of that sort of stuff."
3,average,"The Positive: At a decent, fifth-grade + level, the book covers NUMEROUS ""myths"", unlike books which only touch on a few. I appreciated that. Negative: The drawings/artwork is amateur and dull, which makes the stories less memorable. Good illustrations are important to me. In light of new evidence that the ""Gods"" may be ancient astronauts with high technology, I would like an updated version that presented the ""myths"" more as an effort by less technological people trying to explain these high tech astronauts who were jerking everyone around. The ""myths"" are likely NOT made up stories."
2,Reviews greek to me,"I wanted a book like this for myself and to educate my kids. The reviews were glowing, but I found the illustrations to be weak. They are plentiful, but they don't appeal to me. The cover art is the pinacle of the quality. I feel a bit silly, because I usually do quite a bit of research. I guess this was an IIB--Internet impulse buy.Oh well, I am keeping the book because the text is informative."
2,Great drawings bad research,"The drawings are superb. The stories are accurate,but the depiction of Andromeda was horrible. Andromeda was an Ethiopian woman, not a caucasian woman. It was a bad representation on their part."
5,This book is WONDERFUL!!!!!,"This book tells all of the great stories about the Greek Gods and Goddesses of Olympus! I first read the book when I was very little, and the stories simply enthralled me. I had lost the book for many years and finally found it again and remembered all of the great stories and beautiful drawings in it. This book really is a treasure and one of the most interesting books on mythology that I have ever read, (and I took a mythology course in college). Anyway, if you have some interest or none at all in Greek mythology, buy this wonderful book and you will either expand your interest or create it!!! It is excellent!!"
5,This is a great book!,"My six-year-old son wanted to review this book, so here are his words:This book is great!!!!!!! I like the pictures. I like the way the stories are told, because they're good. I like the gods and goddesses.-Neil, first-grader"
4,Great Book for Learning about Greek Myths,"This book is contains a great account of the different Greek myths. This book could be used for the stories and as a quick reference for when you want to know about a certain Greek mythological character. I think the stories in this book could have been written to be more exciting but it does present the important information.Overall, I would recommend this book for any person, adult or child, who wants a good overview of the Greek myths."
5,Great Resource,"This is a ""must have"" for a kid working on a mythology project. Interesting, accurate and informative."
3,not really the kids version I was looking for,I wanted to introduce my kids to the Greek myths that I had loved to learn about in school. This book is a little graphic for kids under age 10 and I had to skip over some facts about why one God was able to marry his sister or something like that. I was really looking for a more kid friendly version that told of the stories of the different gods and such.
5,An Excellent Introduction to Greek Mythology for Children,"D'aulaire's Book of Greek Myths does a wonderful job of bringing classic mythology to life in a way friendly to children. Uncomfortable themes (at least for my American sensibilities) like castration and marital infidelity are smoothly avoided without greatly damaging the integrity of the stories. The illustrations are top notch and really bring the stories to life. This collection of tales can entertain children for hours. The stories are interwoven with clever transitions and captivating pictures, so even the most distractable children can find themselves enthralled.A truly excellent book that fascinates the reader, captures the imagination, and transports you to a mythological world. An excellent gift for any child. Adults will likely find it a quick read, and might be disappointed that it is lacking the mature themes and details that would make it more complete."
5,As Good as I Remembered,"My junior high used this as a textbook. I loved it so much that I bought a copy, only to lose it years later. Because I couldn't remember the author, I spent more than a decade hunting for a copy (try googling ""Greek Myths""!), but now I've found it. As far as I'm concerned no other retelling of Greek mythology can hold a candle to D'Aulaires'. A must for any library -- personal or public."
5,Its all Greek to me!,Can't wait to teach these in my classroom. My students are eager to know more about Mythology and Ancient Greece.
5,As wonderful as I remember it when i was a child,"When I was a child, my sister and I loved reading this book! So, I bought this book to share with my 8 year old child. The illustrations are beautiful, and the stories are just as wonderful as I remember them to be!"
4,Good source of fun,"I have long lived Greek mythology! This was my first book, when I was 14, and having it back is like a hugging an old friend. I have read others with more fascinating art work, but this one is good, too. The thing about Greek Mythology is just that - it's all made up, and one can tell simply by reading more than one, since they are quite inconsistent. None the less, this is a great starter book, especially for kids!"
5,Wonderful book--a real classic,Gave this to a very smart 10 year old boy who loves to read. He devoured it....so only complaint is that it is not longer!
4,A classic!,"My family's copy of this book is dog-eared and lacking a back cover. I think it's safe to say that it has not sat quietly on a shelf and collected dust! My children have all loved these stories and I think we may be investing in a new copy shortly, as I have one more up and coming reader. I loved these myths when I was a child too, and I can still recall being just a bit scared of some of the pencil drawings. I'd give Greek Myths five stars, if the illustrations were more enchanting, but all the same it is a wonderful book with close to 200 pages of well told tales."
4,"Good writing, good pictures, great stories","I read this book as a child and give it as a Xmas or birthday gift almost every year. This is Greek mythology treated as a adventure stories written for kids. Any kid who likes fantasy will love this book, and will getting a good grounding in the western civ canon without even really trying."
4,"Wonderful, but where is the pronunciation guide?","I know, I know, I should have learned to pronounce these names in secondary school and college, guilty as confessed. That said, how hard would it have been to put a one page pronunciation guide in the back, for former lazy students like myself who want to make sure their kids DO learn to read the Greek names? The hour or two I spent penciling in the phonetic readings could have been much better spent actually reading the stories. Otherwise, this book is wonderful, and deserves 5 stars."
4,Interim judgement...,This is an interim judgment because the book was bought as a present for my grandson's 9th birthday and he hasn't seen it yet. He is becoming interested in Greek and Roman myths and I hope that the intended reading age of 9-12 will be appropriate.
4,Great,This book is great. I never knew how much science was involved in the beaches. I really enjoyed it. Bought it to help my fishing but got so much more.
4,"Beautiful, well-made and sturdy","I really like this lamp for what it adds to an eclectic or 'Island' decor. It's so well-made and even nicer looking in person than in this picture. The only words of caution I'd offer are that 1) it's rather small, if you have not seen it in person--and 2) in terms of providing actual lighting, the shade is opaque and really inhibits the light from being disbursed effectively. However, if you are just looking for a nice, sturdy, pretty accent piece or something to offer mood lighting, this is a great choice!"
4,Nice Small Lamp,This lamp was smaller than I expected but is very nice in detail. It also seems to be of better quality than other rattan lamps I have seen. Nice for bedroom.
5,Loving,"Jerry Vale made the shift from 50's style crooner to 60's pop singer almost effortlessly. The arrangements on this album by Joe Gardner are busy, rhythmic, and upbeat. Some of the tempos are rather fast, but Vale has the technical difficulties for his voice well in hand. The most touching number for me is Les Bicyclettes de Belsize, an excellent example of what Vale could do with a song with an international flavor. Put Your Head On My Shoulder is as comfortable for him as any Italian flavored 50's ballad. I think his phrasing is a little uncomfortable in parts of MacArthur Park, but his high notes in the song are thrilling. The album's sound engineering is vivid and upfront in the typical late 60's manner, and there seems to be some distortion on the vocal tracks, although that may be just a defect in my sound system. Finally, it is nice to have Abraham, Martin, and John on the album as a reminder of the angst in American culture at this time. Vale sings it as persuasively as anyone."
5,Naked faith,"I concur with all those who have praised this book, particularly the reviewer who suggested that it offered a great deal to confound many Christians who are hard-headedly (as well as hard-heartedly) devoted to the pet doctrines of their particular faction. But, of course, non-Christians will likely find de Vaca's account even more provocative. This is one of the more politically incorrect but utterly worthwhile books I have ever read. Along with an unforgettable tale of survival, there's faith healing, a resurrection, and even an account of a native tribe that practices homosexual marriage. Perhaps foremost among those who were most astonished by the miracles he wrought was de Vaca himself. But for the fact that he survived to tell it, de Vaca's story is so extraordinary most would find it impossible to believe."
4,Amazing true account of an excursion,"This is an amazing journal writen to the king of Spain to record the events that took place on his behalf. It has been studied in deepth and found to be unbelievably acurate. Cabeza describes events, in his unique style, from their first sight of land to his return home many years later. He tells about his unfit leader and how he kept himself and many others alive. This part of the book is largely involed around the idea of having faith in God. The most amazing part of his journey comes when he meets with the indians and comes to be thought of as a medicine man. During this time he finds out what happened to many of the people who were his crew and also finds many alive. Over the course of the adventure they make their way from florida all the way into mexico. If you are at all intersted in the history of the first interactions between spaniards and indians, you will love this book."
5,Fantastic Tools,"I have the 5 piece kit which has all the same tools except the planar. I bought the kit earlier this year and used every one of the tools in the construction of an Ipe deck. All the tools had more than enough power for every task I asked of them. The hammer drill was used to drill through brick to mount the ledger board, the circular saw to notch the Ipe railing posts and cut deck boards, the jigsaw to cut notches in the deck boards and the recip saw to cut posts to length. These tools handled everything I threw at them with ease."
5,best bang for any buck,"I got this pack and also received a free 12v impact driver from Bosch. The offer isn't going on anymore, but I'd buy these even if it wasn't. Excellent quality, and strong motors. Hold one of these up to a DeWalt version..."
1,Bad Bosch,"I was under the impression Bosch made good quality tools.Bosch from my recent experience has VERY poor qualtiy control.The jig saw in this set worked twice (on thin plywood) and now just smokes and really heats up the battery.The flashlight never worked.The drill has been working OK, but the chuck is pretty poor, the bits tend to rotate if the bit just binds a little."
3,Detailed but Interesting Perspective on Lenny Bruce's Trials,"I enjoyed this book and its explanation of the trials and tribulations of Lenny Bruce. The stories of when and where he was arrested and how he dealt with the trials and legal system were interesting, but I was hoping for more information about the life and comedy of Lenny Bruce.I thought that the inclusion of a CD with interviews and clips of the trials and comedy routines that got Lenny arrested was an excellent idea and added a LOT to the book. It would have been better to have the CD tracks and links in the book better marked so the reader could tell which track went with which section.If you are interested in how the justice system works and how it brought down the comic genius of Lenny Bruce, then check out this book. The trial discussions were a bit long at times but most of the trial descriptions flowed well. I'd only recommend this one to those who want an insight into the legal details of Lenny Bruce's trials and tribulations."
2,Very Challenging To Follow,"I found this book hard to follow. I was constantly having to look up the meaning of various words (many of which are not in the Kindle dictionary). Might just be me...There are a lot of parallel tracks to follow in this book. Went to see the movie thinking it would be easier to track on, but found it almost as confusing as the book."
2,Visit your library,"If you're thinking about buying this book, I assume you will read other reviews or summaries for info concerning the structure and stories that make up Cloud Atlas. Recapping the whole thing would be almost as tedious as reading the novel.As intriguing a notion as the concept of linking stories through time and space may be, Cloud Atlas failed to provide stories and characters that were worth spending time with. Each individual's story seemed -- there. My personal response to the characters can best be summarized by my exclamation when I got to the place where one character explains how he has arranged his suicide. ""Thank goodness. Will the next story be any better?""Cloud Atlas is one of those books you can borrow from your local library. If you love it, then buy it."
2,Clever Idea...Lousy Execution,"Ordinarily, I'd love something wacko like this. I read it once--disliked it. Read it again to try to better understand it--hated it. It is a verbal assault, and unless you are a masochistic reader, avoid the book...see the movie instead."
3,Cloud Atlas not perfect on Kindle.,The book is great but there are lots of problems I'm finding with the Kindle version. I may be forced in to purchasing a hard copy! This is the first time I've had major problems with a Kindle edition and I read a lot!
5,Nice and Easy,Everything worked out smooth... and the book arrived in good condition. I would buy from them again!
2,Very overrated,"This book is borderline unreadable. Even more, it doesn't really tie into each other except through cheap B-movie lines (like something you might read in a bad fantasy or romance novel). The only part of the book that has any real narrative flow is the first part. Then it quickly goes downhill. My criticism isn't with the subject, the individual plots, or the overwhelmingly weak attempt to ""tie everything together."" It is just the poor quality of the writing. It commits one of the worst crimes a book can be found guilty of...it is just boring."
2,BEWARE,This is a bizarre book which I could not recommend to anyone. I wish my local library had carried it so I wouldn't have wasted the money that I spent. There are some good parts but few and far between. I read it so that I would understand the upcoming movie. I think I will need the movie to help me understand the book.
3,Anal sex much?,"Only finished this one because of the clever style in which it is written. The author spent the entire book flaunting his obsession with anal sex and demonizing everything Christian, capitalist, or white. How do people like this live to adulthood?"
1,Hawaiian's from Canada??,"Like many others here I bought this book based on awards and glowing reviews. It has ended up being one of the worst books I have ever read. I am listening to it on CD and the dialect of the narrator in the Hawaii section is sooooooooooo annoying that I've almost had several accidents while listening to it while driving. The first couple of short stories were just ok, some funny parts, but the sci-fi Korean thing and now this Hawaiian guy who sounds like he from Canada, ""Ya hey dere"", are absolutely killing me. I've reached that point though where I will not let this book defeat me. I am going to listen to the bloody end and then maybe take a sledge hammer to the CDs."
1,Heavy on prose; light on plot,"Heavy on prose; light on plot. The diary was especially irritating, completely written in sentence fragments. The last two parts were annoying as well, written referring to sci-fi elements not yet explained or described. I'm an avid reader, but hate literary fiction when the words are the focus and not the plot. This is more for those who love purple prose and the writing and don't mind a fragmented plot. Fortunately I rented it from the library before buying. Phew! Next time I see Tom Hanks give an interview for a film and recommend the novel, I will think twice. If you didn't enjoy this novel, you are not alone. My advice: if you hate the first 10 pages of each section, just skip it entirely because it doesn't get any better."
1,Long and confusing,"This book was a waste of time shifting back and forth thru time with no real string to bind the story together. I finished it only because I cannot stop a book halfway through no matter how bad, I keep hoping it will get better, this didn't.Don't waste your time or money."
3,Hard work over nothing,"Oh I give up. A difficult read without reward. Yes, I get the point. Over and over again. Only finished half of the book."
2,Difficult...,"interesting book, but difficult to stay engaged in. Eventually you figure out how it all works together, but it was not something I couldn't wait to pick back up and read."
2,Cloud Atlas Review,"Too convoluted for my reading tastes. Why do you need 14 more words in order for me to ""submit""? I do not understand."
2,"dazed and confused! ""cloud Atlas""","Mitchell tried too hard to be complicated and confusing, maybe to be considered ""very brainy"". This read was not enjoyable and I actually finished it just to see what it was all about. The centuries were never labeled which made it more confusing. The ""southern dialect""took too much time to figure out. Give me Dickens!!! I'm turned off to this guy's work unless he can make something I don't get a headache reading!"
2,it's a stinker,difficult reading language archaic confusing so many good books so little time. no time to waste on poorly written books. find another book on which to spend your time.
2,Didn't know what I was getting in for!,"I didn't know anything about this book before I purchased it. When it went to another chapter, I thought I was starting a new book until the weave between the chapters was introduced. I am going to finish it because I bought it, but I certainly don't look forward to getting into it every night. Would I recommend it to my friends - no."
3,"Impressive virtuosity, but lacking in any real insight","I was quite impressed by the virtuosity of the author initially. It is quite difficult to write a book that encompasses different genres. But when I got past the half way mark, the whole book seemed rather empty and pointless. I felt that the unifying theme (if any) through all the stories was not compelling. I finished reading the book eventually, but came away feeling like I did not get much from it."
1,not impressed DIFFICULT READING,it has been one of the most difficult books that i ever have tried to read. I am still on 1% reading and just can't understand the story. DIFFIFULT READING. It was suggested that we read the book before watching the movie.....guess i will never see the movie!
2,Huh?,Spoiler alert...this is 6-amazing short stories that don't connect to each other at all. The first half of the book is the first half of each short story. The second-half of the book is the second-half of each short story. Great individual stories...but don't expect any 'oh-my-god' moments when they all connect...they don't.
4,Well written adventure,"To be honest, I probably read half of this book. But I loved those 4 sections that I did read. I can only imagine that Mr. Mitchell had a huge white board to map these tales woven over centuries and connected by tiny details. Passing this book onto a friend, and hopefully she'll keep it going."
3,Reader Beware,"I bought this on the recommendation of a friend BEFORE the movie came out. While I liked the book, it is painful to read. One of those where you are glad you did it once you are through it, but getting to the end is pure work. If you like very esoteric reads or artsy movies you will probably love this, but just prepare yourself because it really is unlike any other book you've ever read."
4,"Good, but not as great as i hoped","Read the book before the movie in hopes of making what is billed as a confusing movie better. The book is well written and very interesting, but I was hoping fantastic. Also, it did tax my memory thinking back to each first part characters."
4,Stunt writing,"Interesting stories chopped in half and shuffled. Makes the reader work a little. I would rather read a story straight through but this style is fashionable now. Author is good, but I think he is saving his best work for later."
3,A tough read,I've been told it is worth the read but so far I'm having difficulty getting though it. I've read several books since starting this one and I'm not sure if I'll get back to it.
4,"Great book, unique setup","I admit, I wasn't sure how I would like this book at first, but ended up thinking it was pretty fantastic. I got bogged down on one section later in the first half (saying it just didn't hold my interest at all would be an understatement), but in the end I got through it and loved the rest of it. The writing and language is wonderful, and very evocative, and at the end of the book, I found that I really took the time to think back over it rather than just moving on to the next book as I often do."
4,a tour de force!,"what mastery of language! what an unexpected and difficult-to-figure-out -without -help kind of book. that's a challenge! so i confess that i looked for help and after an explanation concerning the lack of normal progression in the timeline of the story, i proceeded to enjoy the use of language appropriate to the time of each tale in the longer story. and what a story! gripping, funny appalling and throughout, remarkable richness of expression, never a repetition. i found it a difficult story to comprehend, in the beginning, but after receiving some help, i thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,"Creative structure, well written, decent story","Creative structure and quality of writing in this book make it a worthwhile read. Traveling through time with the character leaves you with a hollow feeling in your gut. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that the structure adds much to the actual story lines or plot which are nothing special. Maybe if I read it again..."
4,Cloud Atlas,"A very intriguing, well written book composed of several stories of diverse subject matter, from different historical times (past, approximate present and future) with a very clever thread loosely binding them together. I saw the movie and then read the book.... wish it had been the other way around: the movie would have been much easier to follow. I will be buying it on DVD when it becomes available. Buy the BOOK now you won't regret it!!I'll be looking for more of David Mitchell's writings"
5,Great so far,"I haven't finished it yet, but I love it. I love the uniqueness of every chapter being a different story with different characters but yet they all tie together. I will probably read it again."
5,There is a deeper meaning,"This is a superb volume, and the best presentation yet of author David Mitchell's extraordinary skill and flexible voice. One of the amazing things this book project accomplishes is to blur the division between a collection of stories and a novel. There are six stories, linked through threads that are in some cases rather minor, in others critical, but together they make a unified whole with a consistent theme. Some of the reviewers here seem to miss it: The key to the future of mankind is the little things that we do to each other, for each other, or forebear to doing to each other. I can't see that this is a minor, shallow, or missing theme at all; instead it is one that we should keep in our minds and hearts, as I do the various stories presented here and their images, now captured memorably in film."
