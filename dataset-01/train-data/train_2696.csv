2,"Good content, but poor or missing examples","The book was a big disappointment after reading all the reviews. I found the content to be complete, but I would like to see more examples. Also the examples they have were not explained well."
3,Overrated Linux programming book,"I read both editions of this book. When I read the 1st edition, the 2nd was not out, yet. Then the 2nd came out, I read it, too, hoping it's much improved. I was not impressed, however, either. To me, there is plenty of what listed in the book, but not enough why on the things listed.A better alternative, I think, is ""Linux Programming by Example: The Fundamentals"" by Arnold Robbins. Arnold says in that book he plans to write more subsequent volumes on the subject."
3,Difficult to Read Program Listings,"I haven't read this yet, so take my ""3 stars"" with a grain of salt. What immediately struck me was the lousy font chosen for the program listings. It is very weak and while the listings are readable, and most programmers know where to expect {} vice (), for example, it would be nice if your eyes could immediately differentiate between such similar characters. Mine can't."
5,How to talk to the Operating System,"This is an almost beginners book on programming at the Linux operating system level. It is not a book on C itself, but you could probably use it as one. It's real emphasis is on the system call, shared library, file handling level. That is, how to interface directly to the operating system itself to get it to perform what you need it to do.The bookis aimed at three audiences: C programmers who need to know how to get to the Linux operating system, Unix programmers who need to make the transition to Linux (no they're not the same), Linux programmers who need to move upwards in their understanding of the operating system. It does these jobs very well. The authors each spent years at Red Hat developing their releases, have a throrough understanding of Linux and the ability to convey that information to the reader in a clear and understandable manner."
3,Easy????,"I got this for my husband b/c he is going through a crossword puzzle faze. LOL Way to hard though, and he's a smart guy. He has been spending to much time in the bathroom with this book!"
2,Frank Lloyd Wright Book,"Nice little resource for FLW houses open to the public. It is a little outdated, but that was expected with the publication date listed."
1,Prince of Persia,It is not Amazon's fault but I didn't check the requirements before I downloaded the game and the experience was horrible!
3,A Pretty good movie,"It wasnt bad nor good, it wasnt one of hitchcocks best but never the less It was some what enjoyable through out the movie although the ending left some questions un answered"
5,Remembrance of Things Past: tales from wine tasting,"This book is a collection of wine tales. Each of them could stand by itself as a refreshing piece to read. The virtue is that the collection of tales approach wines from the way we remember wines: time, ambience, location and a bit of history of the place. The writer lets you know what he likes and why he does! It is a perspective useful when you are able to find some of the wines that are discussed and taste them. If you know that the overwhelming taste of OAK is not a sign of aging potential, this book is for you!"
4,Every Trick in the Book by Ami Simms,Good book for beginners!! I've been quilting for a while so many of those tricks I've already learned!! I just love Ami Simms so it was a very enjoyable book to read. She has a great sense of humor and that's why I bought the book in the first place!!!
3,spy groupie,"Tabby is good at what she do. She's is soooo good at being a groupie that she's hired with big$$$$$ to set-up a famous actor. Her job is to get close to him, get the information needed and bring it to the public. During her assignment disaster strikes. This book wasn't a waste of time it was interesting and it won't disappointed"
3,Giving him one mo' chance,"I swore that I'd never read another Omar Tyree book again and then I saw Diary of Groupie in the bookstore. After flipping through a few pages I decided to get it. Luckily, Diary is one the best things Omar has written to date. The heroine, Tabitha is an interesting, complicated character and in light of the recent scandal in Colorado, this book with it's depiction of the groupie life and what people will do with money and celebrity, is VERY timely."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I wish I would have read the reviews here before I picked this book up. It is so slow. So far, I have only read one diary entry, and isn't that the name of the book. I don't even want to finish it. I thought I was going to be a fan of Omar Tyree after I read Fly Girl, but I was so wrong. I've read one other book by him (Sweet St. Louis) and it was also a let down. I'm just glad that I got it from the library and didn't have to waste my money."
2,Disappointment,"I am a true fan of Omar Tyree, but this book was a let down. The author has such great writing skills that he does keep you into the book 60% of the time, then I feel he rushes to complete the book and leaves the reader clueless. The main character could have been more developed, we all know the story of the promiscuous woman. He some how brings in characters to off set the main woman, but I don't understand why, there's no depth or follow up to explain their prupose. Skip!!"
1,WACK!!,"THIS BOOK WAS NOT WHAT ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM OMAR TYREE. HE NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THE VISION HE HAD WHEN HE WAS WRITING HIS EARLIER NOVELS. HE GOT AWAY WITH THE DIFFERENT WRITING STYLE WITH ""LESLIE"", BUT THIS ONE IS STRAIGHT TRASH!"
2,Not Quite What I Expected,"I was kind of disappointed after reading this book. It took me forever to get into it. After about 2 months of trying to read it, I made myself sit down one day and attempt to get into it. It took a while to get going. Once it got going, it was decent. It kept you on edge, but I had been wanting to read the book for so long. So after having high expectations, I was extremely disappointed. Definitely not one of his best."
2,Didn't like this one,"Diary of a groupie is the first book by Omar Tyree's that I did not like. I am not really into books that have celebrity characthers, or people setting people up, though I know it's needed sometime. The story was not a favorite of mine."
2,Slow...Slow...Slow,"This story was sooooooooooooo slow...Most of the time when I enjoy a story I can finish it in about 2 to 3 days depending on how much time I have, with this I read 30 pages, got bored with it and didn't even want to pick it up again. I did, and read a little bit more, but it was sooo horribly slow and boring. I'm so glad that I checked it on of the library. I liked Flyy Girl but it seems like that's Omar's only decent book...Never again..."
2,Glad I borrowed it instead of buying it.,"I should have known better than to expect something spectacular from Omar Tyree after the disappointment of For the Love of Money. Still, I wanted to give this novel a chance because Flyy Girl was a great book and because the title was so intriguing. The idea behind the plot was a great one; many readers want to look into the mind of a groupie and find out what makes someone sleep with a stranger only because he has money and fame. Unfortunately, this story failed to do that. I never found out what made Tabitha crave these men, and I was confused by the weird plot twists, numerous one-dimensional characters and gaping conclusion. I give this book two stars instead of one because I managed to finish it, and because it served its purpose: I needed something to read on the train during my commute to keep winos and crazy people from approaching me."
1,Not Worth the time,"Once again, I was disappointed in Omar Tyree. This book was dull, pointless, the plot was a flop to me, and at the end, I was still a little confused about things that went on. There were too many ends left loose, and basically, this book was a waste of my time."
1,"BORING, BORING, BORING","THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY LIFE. I KEPT PUTTING IT DOWN AND THEN PICKING IT BACK UP, HOPING THAT IT WOULD GET BETTER....IT NEVER DID. HE CAN NOT GET ANOTHER CENT FROM ME EVER AGAIN. I HAVE READ TEXTBOOKS THAT WERE MORE INTERESTNG THAN THAT BOOK. IF YOU LIKE BOOKS ABOUT DRAMA, SEX AND SCANDLE THEN DON'T READ THIS. LOL, NO SERIOUSLY I AM THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO GET MY MONEY BACK...BECAUSE THAT WAS A WASTE. IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO GIVE A STAR THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE....."
1,just too boring!!!,This is the reason why i do not read any of Omar Tyree's books.The story meant well but it did not hold my interest at all. I had to push my way through it to finish it. It didn't describe the diary in full. Omar Tyree should have talked more about thethe events of her life as a groupie not just 3 men she bedded!!
3,What the heck was this!?,"I was a big fan of Omar Tyree until I read this book. I had only read one book of his which is Fly Girl and so off the strength of that I purchased this one. Needless to say, I was disappointed. This book was not a bad read it just was not a good read. The diary was so unrealistic and if you ask me, ol' girl brought a lot of pain and drama on herself. I didnt empathize with the characters and the plot wasnt all that. I would not advise anyone to buy this book. If you are a Omar Tyree fan just support him by checking it out of your local library. Save your money so you won't be upset like me."
1,Highly dissapointed in Omar Tyree,"Since I read Flyy Girl, Omar Tyree has gone downhill with his books. I bought this book and I couldn't get past the third chapter. That's all I'm going to say on this book. He's another author I won't be buying."
2,dont waste your money on this book,the first few pages was good but that was about it...I give it 1 and a half a star
2,Pullleeze...,"Omar hasn't wrote a good book since ""A Do Right Man"". Flyy Girl was good, but seemed more for the younger audience. diary of a groupie took a lot to read cover to cover. I thought it was going to be the bomb, but it fizzled into a bottle rocket. NOT WORTH THE MONEY."
4,Good Read,"I couldn't put it down. Although clearly not one of his better books, this book was still very good and entertaining."
3,The end is good,The book is ok. The beginning is very slow the middle towards the end is more interesting. I thought the book would be a lot different. Not a total dissappointment and certainly better than the book about the R & B singer.
2,What was in the diaries?,"When I first started to read this book, I thought it was going to have an explosive ending. It was definitely fast-paced but the ending was weak. First of all, we don't know if Isaac was really guilty and what was truly in the diaries. There should have been more entries of her diaries included throughout the story. Also, I was displeased that she did get the big dream house in the end. Why? She didn't deserve it! Perhaps, Omar left us hanging because there will be a sequel. We should hope!!"
4,BETTER THAN FLYY GIRL!!!,"I LIKED THIS BOOK A LOT AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS GONNA BE ANOTHER BOOK ABOUT SOMEONE WHO WAS JUST A SEX FIEND BUT TOWARDS THE END, IT GOT SUSPENSEFUL AND I JUST COULDN'T PUT THE BOOK DOWN. I LIKED THE FACT THAT FINALLY A WOMAN HAS BEEN THE PLAYER AND PLAYED WITH THOSE MEN'S MINDS AND THE SISTA DIDN'T EVEN USE HER REAL NAME. OMAR EVEN WROTE HER SISTERS IN THE BOOK VERY WELL AS HE POURED THEM IN SLOWLY AND THEY PLAYED THEIR ROLES AS NOT TRYING TO BE THE MAIN CHARACTER. I HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK TO ABOUT 5 PEOPLE AND THEY LIKED IT ALSO. I'M GLAD I LIKED THIS BOOK CUZ AFTER READING THE SEQUEL TO FLYY GIRL, I NEEDED A PICK ME UP. RIGHT NOW I'M READING SINGLE MOM AND SO FAR IT'S ALRIGHT, BUT I WILL LET YALL KNOW ABOUT IT WHEN I'M FINISHED."
1,Don't waste your time or money!!,"This book had a lot of hype so I had to read it. I was glad to get it over with. The plot was so far-fetched, borderling on ridiculous. He introduces way to many characters in the book and then is unable to wrap it up. He seems rushed towards the end. I would not recommend this read."
3,Alright,"I've always been entertained by Omar Tyree's plots, characters, and themes--regardless of whether I am impressed by the WHOLE book, I will continue to read every one of them because of the above explanation. This book was about a golddigger who entered a deal thinking she was about to run things, but her plans were rearranged. My favorite character was Wallace though. I always like his male characters better than female characters because they have more depth. Regardless, the book was cool, just not his best. Readers would think the diary would be important to the story, but in the end, it's thrown to the side like garbage. I feel like I got cheated."
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!,"The plot of this book is goofy. The author needs to stick to one topic. Jumping too far in with the suspense, blackmail,sex ,etc. A boring read."
3,WHAT!!!!!!,"This book was sooooo slow, I had to make myself finish. I wished that I read the reviews. The good thing was that I got this book through a book club. I started getting lost when the story line jumped. I had to go back to the beginning. In my opinion this book and Flyy Girl 2 are the two not so good books by Omar Tyree."
1,OH MY...,"This book is so strange and bad, I don't know if I can put it into words. When I picked this up, and started reading, I thought it would be interesting. Boy was I wrong. This thing sucked! Please do not waste your money. I still don't know what the point of the book was or what really happened. The plot NEVER developed, and I was completely bored."
5,paw print frame,"This product is unique and very nice. It was well packaged and sent promptly. I have not tried the actual imprint of the paw yet, but it looks simple. Thanks!"
5,kyler,"I used this product for two dogs. The product was easy to use, and I would like to add that it is important to follow the directions. The hardest part was talking the dogs in to it. It took more than one try on each dog, but I was able to redo until I got a great print."
5,Love this frame,"I have purchased 3 of these keepsake kits. Making the pawprint impression is fast, easy and, most importantly, not messy. No measuring, pouring or mixing ... you knead the medium, roll it out and put the animal's paw down. Not a good impression on the first try? Knead it, roll it out and try again. Dries hard overnight. I've had one frame for over 2 years and the pawprint impression is still as it was the day it was placed in the frame. The frame itself is sturdy and easy to pop in pictures and pawprints."
5,Very satisfied with product!,"I actually got this frame as a Christmas gift this year from my sister and I think it's great. It's a nice sturdy frame and makes for a sweet tribute to my puppy we lost a couple months ago to an accident. I haven't used the paw print mold since I had already had an imprint made before and it fits just fine into the frame. Overall, a really nice gift for pet lovers!"
5,Great Intriguing mystery,"My 9 year old daughter really enjoyed this book. Its one of the only books she's read so far that she liked. Typically she likes mystery style books but doesn't like to read in general. With this book she read longer than required to sometimes without realizing it. I have read about half way into it to have a sense of the kind of book she admitted to liking so that I might find her more. It has a science fiction theme with intelligent kids as main characters and of course Wishbone as the cute and eager sidekick. I think she was curious to read more as the story never dragged with changing scenarios, written at about a 4-5th gr reading level which kept her on track. She also really likes Wishbone so that helps. So if your child is a choosy reader or not into reading much, I recommend this book based on my daughter's review who said ""It was really good""."
5,Review of Olympus 18-180mm f/3.5-6.3 Zuiko Lens for E Series DSLR Cameras,"The 18 - 180 mm Zuiko lens appears to work better than the two lenses that came with the E-510 Olympus camera when I purchased it. The pictures appear consistently significantly sharper (better focus?) than most photos I've taken with the other lenses. I've had no problems with brightness working at the zoom / wide angle extremes (18 mm & 180 mm) as I think I read in one or two of the other reviews. I doubt I will use the original two lenses that came with the camera much anymore (if at all) because this lens adequately covers their combined zoom ranges (14 mm to 150 mm) -- at least for my use.This lens is a bit on the heavy side, however, compared to my old Rollei 120 tlr, it is still light."
4,Falls a bit short of my expectations,"I bought the 2-lens e-500 camera kit well over a year ago, but felt the 40-150mm lens that came with it was not as sharp as it could be. Because I am trying to build a photography business, I decided recently to replace the 40-150 lens I had. I chose the Zuiko 18-180 for its zoom range; I felt it could pretty much take the place of both of the lenses that came with the e-500, and I wouldn't need to be switching lenses all the time. For that, this lens is perfect. It is also wonderful for macro photography; but for extreme closeups you will need a closeup filter set or dedicated macro lens (the filters work GREAT!).I use a monopod or tripod for most of my shots, but I still don't think I'm getting the sharpness I should be for a lens of this price. So I'm not completely happy with it. I recently ordered an e-520 to replace the 500, but don't have it yet. Maybe that will make a difference, but I've read that it's the lens that makes a great photo, not the camera."
3,"Not Typical, But Enjoyable","I'm in the minority by giving this book 3 stars instead of 5 like everyone else. This was a good story, but parts of the book seemed like a broken record (i.e., ""they just did that""). The characters, although misunderstood by everyone around them, are likable and smart. However, they are mostly untrusting and cannot make committments (to themselves or to others). The book's format keeps the reader interested, but the overall story is depressing. Except for the excessive slang, the language is moderate and the sex is relatively non-descript.To get the most from this story the reader should be melancholy, as it will likely bring down a good mood and reinforce a poor mood."
4,native women,"I really enjoyed this dvd.If you need a shot of self esteem and someBeautiful scenery, this is good for you.I've watched it a few times since purchasing.I even bought one for my mother, she loves it!"
4,Great asset to workout,"I am in a class for Strong Women, Strong bones. Weights like these were recommended, but I made the mistake of thinking I would never need them. Save yourself some time and money by investing in these first. My only problem is that the weights sometimes fall out of the pockets. Other that that I am totally pleased with these weights and their performance."
3,good product,I bought these a while ago and use them allot. I don't use them for rehab or anything like that. I use these for my workouts. The only gripe I have with these is that when using them inlaying down exercises the Velcro isn't enough to hold the one pound weights in there and can be somewhat dangerous.
2,did the job but eventually broke down,"it did the job and is very versatile but didnt last long the weights themselves pull on the fabric and eventually rib it and when you change the weight its hard to keep the weights tight to the fabric with the velcro, i woudlnt buy it again"
2,get used to having to put weights back...,"The weights easily fall out during use..so you have to stop to put them back in..., straps break at their sewed on insertion, and over not that long of a time the solid ""adjustable"" weights wear a hole thru the bottom of the sleeve that is supposed to hold them in place. Only things better than other types I've used is that the weights are solid, so when sleeves wear out you don't get black dust all over the place, and they come in substantial sizes; most are too light for effective work. Would have rated 1 1/2 stars, if that was an option.Would not recommend."
4,Well Made,These are well made. I am thinking I should have gone with 10 lbs instead of the 20. I don't know if I'll ever build up to this weight.
3,Leg weights,I read a book on exercise and it recommended buying these 20 pound weights stating that even some of their 80 year old clients used them. I found I could only get up to about 8 pounds before I thought my bones would crack or something. I recommend just buying the 10 pound weights. I think that is plenty for anyone. Even if you try to use more weights they are constantly falling out of the little velcro pockets.
1,fragile,will tear at the bottom of the weight slots if you plan on being somewhat active when using these. I returned mine within 4 uses.
2,poor quality,"As a person with a disability, Velcro hand weights are an important part of my workout regimen. I had purchased one of these hand weights in the past, and had been disappointed by its quality and how soon the individual weight pockets began to rip open. However, I did decide to give it another shot, and ordered another one to replace the one that was falling apart. In less than six months, the pockets began to tear again, and other parts of the stitching began to give way. Unless you are going to be very very careful in using this product, which is difficult if you plan to have any kind of vigorous workout, I would not recommend it."
3,Good leg weights to do leg lifts with,"Very heavy Ankle weights that I use to do leg lifts and abs and lower body excercises with. Weights have tendency to work their way up and out of their pockets, but you just have to puch them back in. Very sturdy and strong."
4,Slightly disturbing....,"I really enjoyed The Tetherballs of Bougainville, but, frankly, I found it a bit disturbing... just like spending a day in the mind of a moderately psychotic 13-year-old boy. Great book, though."
2,"worthless subject, great structure","I thought Leyner did well to incorporate such a wide array of styles when writing a book. It was, however, one of the most vulgar, juvenile things I've ever read. Points for the large vocabulary and exhaustive research, but the subject matter was too childish to enjoy reading more than once."
2,abandoned read,"Well could be fancy and say its a post modernist novel with a form that counters the tyranny of the outdated narrative and naturalist tradition. Its plot: son at father's failed execution; father enrolled in the State's lotto prisoner execution programme, son writes a screenplay is merely a rack for lots of streams of conciousness/montage pieces.I love books that break with conventions but when they engage me and not being just fun for the writer. I loved 253 or The Saddlebag for example. This is supposed to be his most novel like book but it reads like he lacks the discipline to write for the reader. Or at least not the sober drug free reader...it must be a profound read if stoned"
5,ADVENTURES IN HEBEPHRENIC NARRATIVE,"This must be the best of Leyner's books, but it's still a difficult read. It's like drinking down a jug a Frank's Red Hot Sauce, and I don't think I'd wanna meet anyone who read it in one sitting. (Surely you've seen such people on the cop shows.) Getting through the novel was especially difficult for me, as I had placed a large C-clamp on my head while reading, and with each mention of anything morbid or lewd, I'd tighten the clamp a half turn. The purpose of such an exercise was to reshape my cranium to match the Brainiac forehead of Mr. Leyner. Only a dedicated votary of his work would do such a thing, although Caryl Chessman might've done so too had he lived to read Leyner."
3,A style still searching for an author,"""The Tetherballs of Bougainville"" put me to sleep the first time I picked it up. Not that this is a complaint-- I think it's a testament to Mark Leyner's ability to completely disengage narrative from setting, and emulate music video camera angles and shot editing in print format. But aggressive non-sequiturizing has its limits, and these limits are reached, but never overcome, in ""Tetherballs"". Maybe it's just another symptom of the ""be"" rather than ""do"" ennui that seems to be creeping over extant generations of Americans like philosophical kudzu.""Tetherballs"" should be adored by (for example) unrepentant ""Monty Python"" fans, but it won't take them anywhere they haven't been before. Read some of Ambrose Bierce's more absurd short stories, then read Leyner, and then ponder whether this genre has any stones left to turn."
3,Quietly Aggrandizing the Id,"A highly evocotive tale of a boy, his fame, and a sneak peak into the riddles of a brain so complex it delineates all foward thinking. The Teatherballs of Bougaineville is one of those books- packed with vocabulary and 5 cent words that'd coerce your high school English teacher to hide beneath her desk and conceed to your sophomoric jabs as to why she can't answer your questions. Leyner is a fuel-injected Jersey maniac, that just happened to corner the command of the English language. His highly volitile satire's are called satires by most, but in essence are fussilades of ingenious thought that spew forth from his mind to the page, landing in curious by stunning patterns."
5,"Excellent, entertaining, similar in style to ""Et tu, Babe""","I enjoyed Leyner's ""Et tu, Babe"" greatly, and so read his other books (Ester Williams, My Cousin, Tooth Imprints), but didn't like them half as much. This book is similar in style to ""Et tu, Babe"", every bit as funny, and more insightful."
4,"Well...nice. Different, but nice.","The ""Tetherballs of Bougainville"" is not a book that can be prepared for if you have never read Leyner before. The premise of the story is odd and so is the rest of it. However, it's just so, so funny. Today's society never really prepares you for a book like this. The energy of the writing builds on itself with an obsessive-compulsive bent for details and seemingly amphetamine induced mania. Enjoyable to read with an receptive mind, letting Leyner smatter your brain with the bizarre images and words. Best to let Leyner just do his thing and go along for the ride. Every once in a while there might be ""Bougainvillian"" flashbacks, but in the end worth it for the fresh, warped perspective."
3,Good Book.... needs some improvements too.,Focus on State diagrams is excellent. Chapter 1 is redundant. Choice of Examples is good but the examples could have been more simpler. Coherency is missing when the same example is discussed in multiple chapters. It would have been better if different examples are used to explain concepts in different chapters. An must buy book for those who use the related tools.
1,pass on this,"Everything you want to hear you can get somewhere else, WITHOUT SOME JACKA$$ stepping all over it with pointless screaming that adds NOTHING. Its all ruined by this klutz screaming tin re verbed pointless call-outs over the remixes (most of which aren't worth listening to anyway)."
4,I'm Stumped!,"I don't know why I enjoyed this book so much, but I did! The characters weren't as well-rounded as I would have liked them to be, there wasn't a lot of plot development and main character's pursuit of the man of her dreams wasn't particularly to my liking. But I really liked this story! In fact, I've read it twice!It reads like a fairytale, with the characters being broad and archetypal and some of the situations are overly dire. The fairytale ends on a happy note with the evil folks getting their comeuppance and the good securing their happily ever after. In between there are some good, hearty laughs.I do like the dialogue and the small-town flavor of it does ring true to me. I've been through those weird church issues and heard a lot of the same things, so I guess this story sparked some lively memories of my previous small-town life. Murray is a good storyteller and I think he got the essence of the characters, but needs to learn to flesh them out a bit more."
2,up and down,"When I started this book I thought it was funny and was going to be a great read but as I read furthur I was starting to get bored w/it. I think this book lingered on tooo long it took me a week to read this book, I normally read a good book in 3 days top. It should have had more drama in it or something. I really want to read this author's other book but I'm afraid it will be the same as this one. People would probably say ""well why did you continue to read it?"" Well the author would put just enough drama in it to make u want to know what will happen next so then you keep reading and reading and reading then when you stop there's something else....oh well"
3,"Very unrealistic and annoying at times,","Ruth takes us on a journey ride throughout the entire book as she vows to get Dewey to want her. I couldn't relate to that because the author of this book didn't give us a reason to care for Dewey. He was always short with Ruth and it was like he was coming across as being rude to some extent. It takes forever before he finally notices her. He doesn't want her until end of the book. After she follows him, apply for a job at the school where his kids went, stalked his apartment, and confronted his mother, he decides he's interested in her. The ultimate dissapointment was when she decides she no longer wants him. Geeze. The whole outbreak of arguing at the church was way over my head too. I don't know any church people to behave like that."
1,Do not buy this book!!!,Do not buy this book unless you like the idea of wasting your money. This was probably one of the worst books I have ever read. I was really excited about it when I purchased it but now I regret the time I spent reading. The characters have no depth and the language is nothing but annoying. Take my advice and pass this one over.
3,My Second JJ Murray Read,"I was okay with the story in the beginning, but towards the end, I was irritated with the female character in this book. I mean true, everyone has their moments, but it seemed like she actually had a meltdown that was uncalled for. It seems that in each of the author's books, the woman is ""overly"" dramatic, and the male is always very passive and it just irritating for me. I totally disagree with the author and how he seems to make the women in his stories all overly sterotypical."
1,I rated one because zero was not an option.,"Words to describe Ruth (main character): self-centered, vindictive, immature, illiterate (yet she was a teacher, smh ),walking stereotype, desperate, and just plain pathetic.She used every excuse to stay with the church when really she was still stuck on her ex-husband. I quickly tired of her ""woe is me"" act, but unfortunately at that point I still had 200+ pages left in the book. I skimmed over her depressed state after the church voted against her and Dewey b/c I felt like I had stomached enough of her never ending self-loathing. The rest of the characters were card board cut outs, I lost track of all the old gossip women (Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Jonhson, etc), The relationship between Dewey and Ruth was completely unbelievable, and the cover art was extremely misleading.All in all one of the worst books I have ever read. JJ Murray has made my list of authors who's work I will never support."
3,Not your Typical Love Story,"This my very first interracial read. I cannot say that I identified with characters but, I found they were interesting. Many of them I felt to be were more, ""dramatic"" or maybe should I say ""exaggerated. Some parts of the story such as the ending or the ""drinking from the Mason Jar guy"" were not very realistic but, it was really sweet. It sweet to watch Penny and Dewey fall for one another in a nontraditional sort of way."
4,Down right good book! and Funny too!,"I have to admit I was a little hesitant about this one because of the spiritual overtones of the synopsis, but after just finishing it about 10 minutes ago I am floored. I loved the story. I can relate to Penny's bout with weight and the scorn from friends about the man you choose to pursue. I loved the character of Fred, please God send me one too! In all this book is great heart warmer, true romance! Love it!"
3,Still Reading It,"I am still reading this book but it's kind of depressing the way she is being taken advantage of. And the cover makes it look like she and the guy are just a little pudgy according to the book she is ""Oprah in the early 90's big"" and the guy is John Goodman from Roseanne."
1,annoying,"it started out ok, but Ruth started to get annoying! sometimes she's a strong woman and other times she just seems so stupid and yes ANNOYING!!! i liked JJ's other book, but this was very disappointing. sorry. just my opinion."
5,This Album is now part of our Christmas Tradition!,"When I first heard this album, I fell in love with it and ordered copies for family and friends. My favorite track isBel Bambino, which is absolutely beautiful--I never tire of listening to it. Ida Zecco's voice is beautiful. I also love the children's voices on Merry Christmas. I recommend this album to all. It is a gem!!"
5,Great hidden gem,"My mom had this book sitting on the bookshelf for years when I asked her one day to recommend a book she came across it. She looked surprised when she saw it as if she had forgotten about it. ""This one! This is a great book, you will love it."" So I read it and I did love it. I also found a copy on Amazon and gave it to my boyfriend and he loved it.This is a memoir with a classic theme (boy becoming a man) but with wildly interesting events. It is an amazing story that will stick with you for years to come. Its been ten years since I read it and I still regularly recommend this book.My boyfriend was turned off by the ""old timey"" cover and was skeptical. But once he started reading he loved every page and couldn't tear himself away."
4,"Fast, furious and fun, but ends abruptly","Gameplay is very smooth, and very quick. Environments are dynamic--options for cover and sniping change as battles continue. The game is almost too limited in the options for issuing commands to your Delta squad brethren, but command functions are well implemented and easy to use.The major drawback of this game, as stated by many other reviews, is how short it is. The game in fact ends very abruptly, almost as if it was rushed to market without the last two or three levels. The ending cut scene insinuates that you will start the next section of the game, and then the credits start rolling. I was disappointed by the ending, it felt almost like I had played half a game.Lucas arts probably just wants to max out it's income on expansion packs. Profit is alway more important than product quality--right?"
3,We need more.,"Good game, good graphics for its age, fun gameplay....Not enough missions and levels. This game could almost be played in one sitting. Hopefully sometime soon in the future, we will see a sequel, especially with the the books that are in print about these characters and this time frame. Well worth the buy, just expect to be left wanting more."
4,Too Short,"This is a great game, which I recommend to any gamer, the squad is made for fun gameplay, they arent as stupid as the AI in alot of games and almost never frustrated me enough to bother me, the only complaint I have about this game is that it only takes place in 3 different settings, which means there are alot of redundant maps, not as bad as Halo was, but it still ngets old after 2 hours of playing your still on the same level looking at rooms that look like the last 20 you went through, this is still a great game though, a must for any game collection."
4,MOH: Pacific Assualt a la Star Wars with a smart squad,"This isn't just another run and gun game, do that and you are dead, this is a tactical shooter where you have to make the calls by the minute and rather than using your own firepower to stop entire armies, you use that of your squad. Unlike previous squad shooters where you would either have no control or very limited control of your team, this gives you exclusive control over your squad with a simple press of a button. If you ask for covering fire you are going to get it, your team is not going to run in circles yelling out random scripts until they or you get killed, they are going to shoot your ememies. While it can be relatively short, it is worth buying for those who either love Star Wars or just want to have fun blowing waves of droids and aliens to kingdom come."
3,Does not support joystick/gamepad,I really wish I could return this product. It would be an awesome game if you could play it with a joystick/gamepad (as you could with Battlefront). Even if you could change some of the options to a joystick/gamepad it would make the game better. Trying to play it with a keyboard and mouse was too awkward and no fun.
1,still can't play it,"i've tried everything to get this game to work, even complained to lucasarts. i visited the support forum, and there are hundreds of people who can't play the game.basically, the intro runs fine. then when the first level is loading, it locks up and crashes.i have 2 month old computer, latest drivers, everything.bah!"
3,SW RC,I have not been able to run this game on my laptop. Been since I received the game. online with SecuRON support people who have not been able to help me yet. Still hoping. I installed in on a friend's laptop and it works fine. Don't know what to say.
5,to awesome for words,"I really can't communicate in words how awesome this game is. It is wicked fun to play, has intelligent AI, good graphics, and offers an amazing look into the darker, military world of Star Wars. It's really nice to be able to fight through the Clone Wars from a perspective other than that of the Jedi."
3,Not bad but could have been better...,This video is for everyone: hardcore supporters of the Zapatistas and for those who know next to nothing on the struggle. It details the history and cause of the uprising in Chiapas but leaves much out of Marcos' personality. If you'd like to know more of his agenda you'd be better off reading his speeches in the internet. I also liked the way the documentary depicts the culture of those living in Chiapas.
3,Not an in-depth look at the situation.,"If you've read the collection of writings in Ya Basta! and followed Marcos's and others writing online, you may find this documentary uninformative and lacking in real detail about the people involved on both sides, and the philosophy of the Zapatistas. Still, the subjects themselves are interesting enough to give A Place Called Chiapas a watch if you're interested in the Zapatista movement."
3,Not too great.,"I had higher hopes for this, not horrible but I wouldn't get it again. I just didn't see much of a difference from using it."
5,Have not seen much repair but love how it makes my hair look,"I hoped this would do a number on my split ends considering all the wonderful reviews it got for it but I haven't seen much of a difference. I can't say I don't this product for other reasons though. It makes my super soft, smooth and managable with a lot of shine. I don't use it too often though because it conditions it so much that it leaves my hair limp if I use it too much. I'm already done with half of the bottle and I noticed a difference in my hair after the first use, but major differences after the first 3 or 4. I definately reccomend!"
5,Great Product,"I love this product. My hair is stressed to the max from curling, coloring, chemical straightening and everyday styling and from the first use I could tell immediately how healthy my hair felt. I used it three days after getting my hair ""relaxed"" and it's amazing!!!!! I highly recommend if you want your hair to be repaired."
5,I like it,I've been using this item for few years. It helps me greatly to keep my hear from falling out. As long as I use it regularly my hear is healthy and strong. I have recommended Hask Placenta to all my friends.Since couple years ago Hask Placenta disappeared from stores and the only place I can find it is Amazon. The shipments come in timely manner and with no problem so far.
3,It's ok,"I did not receive the free 1oz vial. The product seems to work ok. I use several products so I don't know which one is doing the trick. I like to use it when I am rolling my hair in a ""straw set"" to wear it in its natural state. I am transitioning from a perm after several years."
4,pretty good,"My hair did feel a little better and look shinier after using this product, and it didn't leave any kind of film on my hair after styling. My hair isn't in terrible condition, but I do have some breakage and tangles, and this made it look smoother after drying."
3,Didn't do much for me,"Bought based on the many great reviews. My hair is dry, but not particularly damaged, so perhaps that's why my results weren't as good as others. I noted that my hair is a bit softer, but does not appear any different than usual."
5,"Product, Great--Supplier, The Greatest","This product is great and at a reasonable price. In addition to giving praise to the product, I would like to give high marks to Cosmetic Solutions (The supplier). The product was lost in shipment through no fault of this Amazon Associate company. My follow-up was answered promptly with a follow up call to report that the lost item had been found and reshipped to me at no cost. If there were provisions for a 6th star I would give it to them."
1,Very Bad and maybe dangerous,"This product is very a wast of money, I used it for more than week, and since my hair is falling like crasy.I'm not satisfied with this product and I will not recommande it, so please be careful before chosing it"
5,One of THE BEST Conditioners Ever!,"A few days after seeing this product on AMAZON, I happened to see it in a neighborhood store, so I bought it. What a surprise!! This is one of THE BEST leave-in conditioners I've ever used. In fact, as I'm typing this review, I honestly cannot think of a leave-in product that matches this (Hask Placenta). Not only does it condition, but it texturizes the hair, leaving it conditioned, soft, silky and shiny. I'll be using this stuff forever!It's great!"
1,Not as clever as I thought,"This little book sounded like just what I could use in running a group of ""Primetimers"" at church...having socials I mean.It is not very cleverly written.....and I will probably get rid of it."
1,Fluff,"I like self-help books; I was tricked into buying this book because of its title. I was angry when I realized the book was simply one-page, drawings (poorly done) with comic one-liners. The book was offensive to me."
5,Fun Read!,"Cute book, great, quick read! I'm sorry to say that I may already be turning into a little old lady! : )"
2,"""LITTLE"" discribes this book",If I had known this book was only a 3X3 inch book I would have been a little more prepared. I couldn't give to my sister to read because it was just too LITTLE for her to actually read. I had trouble myself. A few things in it were sooooo true. Cute LITTLE book though.
1,Not the item ordered,"I ordered a book that I had read and saw on Amazon the same book which was approximately 5"" X 7"". However, the book I received was only a miniature with a few lines of print on each page. I was very disappointed and will not use it as an inclusion in a gift to a friend. It is not a real book like I had and ordered accordingly. Next time I will buy it in the local market."
3,How Not to become a Little Old Lady,"I was pleased with the fast service, but disappointed in the size of the books. The original one was a bit larger, however considering the price it's o.k."
1,Book,I returned the How Not to Become A Little Old Lady books........thought it would be really funny for a gift. Not funny at all! Was actually kind of 'dumb'.........sorry!
2,Was expecting something different,"I was expecting a book with a story. Instead it is a book of one thought on each page. It is small about 3"" by 4"". From the picture I thought it would be about the size of a standard paperback book."
2,destroyed on arrival,"i wanted this for a argentinian friend, the 1 who introduce me to Spinetta, 12 years ago..it was a gift for his Bday and Xmas. When it arrived the top of the CD cover was totally destroyed and the top of the audio CD had scratches as well. It was sealed so i found out too late, i saw everything when he opened his present in front of everybody at his bday party, i was ashamed. im not happy with this purchaised."""
2,Not Hella good,"Cool color light output, but really diminished light power. These also burn out super fast.Hella used to be a great German product, not a Chinese made piece of poop. Sad."
1,Dimmer than the stock (oem) 50/55W bulb.,PROS: someone told he it is supposed to help in the fog?CONS: Dimmer than the stock (oem) 50/55W bulb even though it is 70+ watts.Yellow is really and noticibly dimmer than stock. The bulb performed fine when installed - I just didn't like giving up brightness for the sake of better wet wether visibility.Much better to get the 70/100W by the same company so you get a nice 70W low and 100W high.
1,Overpriced Garbage!,I find it more than a bit ridiculous that Pur charges 27 dollars for their product and 20 - 25 dollars for their replacement filters. I have owned 3 Pur sink mounted water filters and every one of them has ended up in the garbage within the first year of use. Why? Because they begin to leak at the faucet connection and this leak grows progressively worse over time. Tightening the unit does not help and in fact may make the leak worse. Removing and reinstalling the unit does not help. I have become so frustrated by Pur water products that I will never again purchase anything made by them. I just installed a Brita filter on my sink a couple of days ago and no problems yet and even if any do occur the Brita is more reasonably priced and in fact cheaper for the sink mounted unit. Do yourself a favor and avoid this over-priced piece of junk at all costs.
1,Housing cracked in only 2 months!,"Purchased this for work because I use a Pur on my home faucet. Within 4 months of purchase, the filter housing developed a crack in it and began squirting a stream of water across the room. There are only two of us in this work area, and it is a secure work zone, so we know that nobody else could have cracked the housing. After reading several reviews around the web it looks like this is an issue with this model. Pur needs to get their act together and stop using cheap plastics for this plumbing disaster. Oh, and by the way, it still has the original filter in it, so I know it is not a filter change problem. I'm very disappointed and will not be purchasing another one any time soon. It's a shame too, because I really like the taste of Pur filtered water."
1,Great filtering - inadequate filter mount,I purchased two Pur filter mounts in the space of one year. I've given up completely on that system and moved to pitcher filtering; a simpler and cheaper solution. The gasket inside the mount appears to have been designed to fail over a short period; usually within a year. Examination of the gasket reveals a material that disintegrates over time as faucet water washes it away. This is quite evident while in use: as much water escapes from the faucet as from the filter when in use. In the old days we called this planned obsolescence
1,PUR has gone down the tubes.....,"I purchased a PUR Ultimate faucet filter many years ago , and used it daily without any issues. It really was bulletproof . Finally, after at least ten years of use, it developed a pinhole leak in the viewing window. I figured I'd replace it with the same model .... well, I found out that what was a reliable, well built product has now been turned into total garbage. These units now crack and leak within a short period of time . I've been through three in the last year now, and am done messing with them. Try a different brand , Proctor and Gamble have apparently re-worked the original design into a piece of junk that is built to break."
1,"Uhm, sucks?","Like someone else has pointed out, this baby leaks after roughly 4 months. We held ours together with tape, but the water never got filtered right after that, and tasted exactly the same as tap water."
1,Waste of money,"I have PUR Ultimate 3-stage. Within 2 weeks the water becomes a trickle. The black rubber band inside gets worn out very quickly. There are constant leaks even after following instructions exactly, talking to manufacturer on the phone and getting an ""improved"" unit."
4,Water tastes wonderful and easy installation,We had a plumbing leak in the house and they replaced the pipe with PVC. We had a really bad taste to the cold water until we bought this purifier. The bad taste is gone and the water tastes better than bottled water!
1,Trickle Down Theory,"With a new filter, it works for a day, and with each use the water comes out slower every time. I have tried 3 new filters, same results every time. Maybe my water has too many mineral deposits and I need something more powerful.With the last filter I used, the water trickled out from the beginning. I have removed the filter and put it back on, thinking maybe I did something wrong (its an easy installation, so I doubt it).My advice: Save your receipt if you want to try this! Its just not worth it. In what you pay in filters, you could probably get bottled water DELIVERED."
1,Nearly Immediate Issues,"I bought this from Lowes less than two months ago and it is now completely useless. Within about a week, it had already started to develop cracks in the outer plastic around the indicator from the stress on the plastic from the interior pressure. I would have taken it back, but the package and receipt had already gone out in the recycle.And I am the one who installed it. I can say with certainty that it no trauma ever befell it, or anything that might have damaged it in the slightest.I had to take the thing off because every time we'd go to get a glass of water we'd get sprayed in the face like a Three Stooges gag. Never buying Pur anything ever again. If I could give it less than one star, I would.I guess don't buy this unless you are Larry, Moe, Curly, or Shemp."
1,Pur has expensive low quality filter parts,"I've owned three of these Pur filters in two years, and the same problems continue to show up: water leaks where the filter valve attaches to the faucet ($120 wasted). Pur knows that this is a design problem yet they continue to make low quality parts so we get sucked into their scam. The cartridges are also pretty expensive after replacing them every two months, which can equate to at least $60-$70 a year on filters alone. Failure to replace them in two to three months always result in water coming out in drips. I will never touch another Pur product again! I've decided to invest in an under the counter filter, which are easy to install, less clunky looking, and more appealing ($80). Another perk is that my $40 invested in the under the sink filter cartridge will last a year and not just a few months."
1,Terrible. Water slows to a trickle within weeks......,"They claim that the filters last a few months, but this is incorrect. Within weeks or even days, the water will slow to a trickle and make the the thing virtually unusable (like it takes several minutes just to fill a glass of water....who is going to put up with that?) This will occur even if you follow the instructions exactly and let the water run for five minutes when installing.Given that the filters cost around $15 each, this makes the water extremely expensive. Avoid PUR for this reason. From what I've read, all models have this problem."
3,SLOW POUR,"Hello,I live in Santa Clara California in an older home. My water became so bad tasting I had to do something about it. I purchased the PUR water filter and it had an IMMEDIATE impact.Only down side is, the filteration process is EXTREMLY slow."
3,Built-in problem,"In a nutshell: filtration excellent, mechanical quality poor.The leak at the faucet that several reviewers have mentioned is due to a weak part that cracks. It is a sleeve inside the ribbed ring that is used to tighten the filter to the faucet. The sleeve is small, fragile, and is subject to lots of force every time you move the filtration canister. If yours leaks it is not a manufacturing defect-the part is designed this way and if you replace it with a new one, you're wasting your time. Sooner or later, same problem. Solution: consider the cost of all those filters and look into a reverse-osmosis unit. Cheaper in the long run."
1,Leaks horribly.,"I have yet to check out the warranty service, but I am pretty upset that after 6 months this thing is leaking on the top right side of the filter. The plastic actually cracked. Piece of junk. It did filter water nicely, though. Back to the pitcher...."
1,Leakage problems,"We have gone through two of these; both started leaking pretty quickly. I would not recommend, as I checked the consumer affairs site and many people have the same problem. The water was good, but we get a shower when we use it."
1,Always Breaking and Leaking,"I have never owned one of these that lasted more than 6 months without breaking and leaking somehow. This filter mount is made of cheap plastic that cracks and/or lets water through the replacement window. However, I still continue to buy a new one each time after 3 years because I need to filter my water and this is the best model for the money. Other brands and designs have just as many problems or are not cost effective."
2,Leakage is a quality problem,The Pur faucet filters have a leakage problem where it connects with the faucet. The leak is not where it connects to the faucet but the other end where it connects to filter body. I think Pur should admit this quality problem and replace the units
2,Filtered water when you can get it,"I bought two of these and after about a month, the water flow became so slow they were unusable. The filter might be effective, but performance is so poor that other factors are irrelevant.Replaced this item with a Brita faucet mount. Much easier to install, no leaks, much better flow. And cheaper."
1,Worst Product I Can Remember Buying,"First, the product doesn't include a filter with the faucet attachment, unlike Brita. But the package isn't clearly marked to tell you this. Second, I followed the instructions, let the water run through the filter for five minutes, etc. After only three days, the stream slowed to a trickle. It took half a minute to get a full glass of water. Third, the indicator was so dim it was all but impossible to see. Pur sent me back to Brita, and makes Brita seem like it was designed by NASA. Pur was a waste of money."
1,Leaks on all ends,I have been using the previous-design water faucet purifier and it started to leak on all ends after a year. i thought it was a design flaw and gave it a second try with the newly designed 2-stage faucet filter. What a piece of crap! It leaks at the faucet and at the clip-on right from the start! who had this cheap idea? Their Chinese suppliers? They are ruining the P&G brand name with this crap! I buy a Brita now and return the Pur.
1,PUR Filter Housing Develops Cracks and Leaks,I thought I might have damaged the first filter housing I bought. It began spraying water through cracks which developed on the surface facing away from the faucet. So I replaced it a couple of months ago. The new one has developed cracks and minor leaks. The filter cartridge indicates 50% full (used).Two tries is enough for me. Both of these units are going back to the manufacturer via manual toss through window.
1,PUR Filters Crack,I have had two faucet mount units within the last 3-4 years. Both units have cracked. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,Avoiding the scams...? Written by a scam insider..!!,"Ms Christiana Ferra-Gilmore and her husband Gene Gilmore were most recently involved with the most outrageous and persistent scams in recent Hollywood acting history. Though the Be/GonnaBe and several other Eric DeSantos fraudulent businesses, the team cleverly lured thousands of trusting parents into schemes where Ms Ferra Gilmore was entrusted with providing the acting, singing,m dancing and modeling classes through her Rising Stars set up.Of course, all turned out fake in any of the name guises, and several class action law suits are under way against all involved, reason why you won't be able to find the Rising Stars, nor any of the Be/GonnaBe web sites anymore.So, the book in itself clearly explains the scams they set up, and the DVD further extrapolates the level of detail these scams worked to ensure the trusting parents gave their hard-earned cash by the thousands for the promisse of fame for their children."
4,One of the top business books,This book gives both inspiration and practicals to make any small business a successful venture. It certainly changed the course of my business and got me to work at making my business something that can be reproduced through the processes that I create.
5,Important Mindset for Most Business Owners...,"This is a really phenomenal book. The concepts are not so overly intellectual that you are smacking yourself on the forehead - yet, like so many 'truths' they hit you like 'I know that' but in fact, you really didn't or you would have been doing it... =}What I especially like about this book is that it gives a few diamonds of action that the reader can immediately put to use in their business, I absolutely loved the concept of creating a from the end in mind Org Chart. This has proven to be invaluable for our organization.The only criticism I may have is that most people who are going to be reading this book have precious little time to dedicate to any one book and it's a little verbose...But the content is crucial, especially for anyone leaving the work force who is planning on starting their own business. Read this first. Highly recommended."
5,how not to quit your business,"if you have ever wondered if you lucked into your business, if you were really supposed to end up the owner... that you just want to quit your life, that you don't know how to do it, that you just want to take a vacation, that you are never going to have a life, that your life chose you, you didn't choose it... and on and on... take control of your business and your life with this book... learn how to detach and create a great business... learning to work on your business not in it... lead your business- not it lead you... you can do it... this is the first step. I promise... get a friend and meet weekly and talk about it... small business owners biggest problem is that they feel alone... that no one else can help or do it... get this book... i promise it will lead to liberation and reward.."
5,"Read the book, change your life!","This book came to me highly recommended, When I read it I kicked myself for not picking it up sooner. The book told me how to set up a business to be happy & make money. I thought thats great but I couldn't apply it to my business. Then, I finished the book, that's when it all came together, how I could apply it, what changes to make, what direction to go! It has been a tremendous help, BUY & READ this book!"
5,Gerber Screws Head On Straight for Entrepreneurs,"An original exposition of what it takes to make a business a success. Author Michael Gerber aims his classic at the small business owner, and his first point is that the company works for the owner, not the other way around. Mr Gerber's insights flow from there, and cover the disciplines of management, marketing, hiring, and measurement. The E-Myth is required reading for budding entrepreneurs. Read it."
4,Good,"Needed it for class.A great read but not exactly what I expected.It tells you how to be an entrepreneurs, to manage a business, and a bit on how you can revive a failing business."
4,I will not be a Sarah,A must read for every small business owner. You will have an epithany. Because of this book I have increased my income by 60%. Please read this book if you want to survive in small business. It should be part of Biz-management class.
1,Extremely simplistic and non Earth-shattering,"The author took way too long to get to his points and when he finally did I was left asking ""That's it?"". I suspect this book is for someone who is really novice at running their own business. But even then, it doesn't give enough practical advice for the novice to then implement some concrete ideas. I truthfully don't see why this book received all the praise it was given."
5,"Entrepreneuring as ""dojo""","I just finished reading the brazilian version of ""E-Myth Revisited"" by Michael E. Gerber. The book is great. As the author says ""This book is not simply a prescription for success; it's a call to arms [in life]... It's a call to [continuous] learning."" Intriguing. It is a must for businessmen and business teachers. Professor Giba Canto."
5,Quintessential stuff!,"Some of the best insights into business for a non-business person ever. Really fundamental stuff, but powerful and emancipating. I would highly suggest this book to anyone doing business or contemplating business."
4,Good abridgment,"Purchased this for a co-worker with limited vision. While it is a abridgment of the book, it covers the main topics quite well and provided him with the ideas that I needed to convey. It can also provide a quick review of the book after an initial reading."
4,Read this BEFORE you start a business!,"This book taught me that if you open a pie shop because you love making pies, you're in for a big shock. At least half your time will be spent on the business, rather than in it. The book also showed me how to systemise my operation to maximise my pie time."
5,I Wish I Would Have Read This Years Ago,"Wow. ""E-Myth: Revisited"" should be on the list of required reading for anyone who wants to start a small business or feels trapped by their current small business. This book completely turned everything that I thought I knew (and I have an MBA) on its head - particularly the assumption that you had to start a business based on your existing competencies. You don't. The chapter describing the ""Entrepreneurial Seizure"" seemed like it was written just for me. The basic premise of the book is that in order for a business to survive and grow, it must be built upon a ""turnkey"" repeatable set of systems, processes and procedures. As an Enterprise Architect whose career has been built upon constructing repeatable systems, I wholeheartedly agree. The material itself isn't revolutionary. However, the fact that someone was able to package it into a concise and easily applied methodology is somewhat revolutionary. A book that I wish I had read years ago."
3,enough already,"Gerber has packaged ""old wine"" in a new bottle. If you read his original ""E-MYTH"" book you need not read this one.The original was great but this one is a rehash of the same concepts and the extra ""padding"" is excruciating!I was hoping for the pie shop to explode.mike"
5,Initiated a Paradigm Shift,"This book caused a paradigm shift in the way I view my network marketing at home business. Instead of seeing what I do as selling a product or service, I realized what I was really selling was opportunity. The book caused me to see my business as a franchise opportunity which significantly expanded my ability to make money. In addition, the book inspired me to begin a network marketing blog (...) and create a seminar based upon the concepts presented. I highly recommend the book to anyone looking to start a small business and is looking to expand.Be a Cop!"
4,*** A must for any entreprenuer! ***,"Anyone who is looking to get into business for themselves should get a copy of this.It is full of insightful and interesting ideas which make you think. If you are not sure being in business for yourself is the right thing to do, then this will help make your decision easier.It is better to get this before making any decisions, than to regret it later after jumping without thinking through your process."
5,The EMtyth Revisited,"This book came to me in great shape in a timely manner. It was a discarded copy from a library, but hey, who cares? It was perfectly readable, that's why I purchased it! I recommend this seller."
1,A complete waste of time,"If you have any basic business intelligence you will find this book will not offer insights or methods that will make a difference to you. The author consistently uses examples that are too general in business scenarios that apply to only a fraction of the population (""pie shops"", for example).I have a professional services company and bought the audio book to listen to while I drive to work, with minimum expectations; I would have been satisfied with even a few insights that could potentially be productive practices for me or my employees. I was stunned at the absolute lack of any ideas with substance or direction. I have had conversations with students and blue collar workers who are more interesting.The fact that the author promotes his own consultancy business is comical. Talk about low hanging fruit...I'd like to get access to that client list for prospecting!"
3,Basic and Dry,"This book was reccomended to me as a must read. well I read it and it was unimpressive. It may be of value to a young entrepreneur with little business education, but rather basic for someone with a degree in business."
2,This is one of the most dangerous business books I've seen.,"I can't believe so many other readers love this book. While I believe systems are important to running a business I also think they stifle creativity. Moreover, I believe the American public is sick and tired of the commoditization of products and services which is essentially what happens when systemization occurs. Overall, this book is not about running a business or entrepreneurship. It's a book about running away from business. Bankers, other lenders and other interested parties can smell that kind of lack of enthusiasm..."
5,great book. a must-have for any entrepreneur,"For those of you who have heard of the E-Myth, you know that it's the must-have resource for starting--or running--your own company."
4,Inspiring,"This was an excellent book, I enjoyed the book from cover to cover. The information and story within kept me attached to the book. I don't own a business, but hopefully soon I will. You better believe I will follow the steps I learned from this book."
5,Book worth reading,This book is well worth your time and money. It is easy to read and explains the reseans why small businesses fail and why they also succeed.
5,Must Read Business Book,"I got an advice from a friend to read this book and it was really great advice.Small or big business owner, you must read it."
4,Lots of useful information,"This is one of the few business book I read and understood! Michael E. Gerber writes in a simple language and with the example of Sarah, the young woman that sells pies, the reader will find answers to his questions about running his small business efficiently."
2,Too much waffle & dreadful story telling style,"Useful business management content but incredibly diluted through the story telling style and waffle. Its like reading a novel in places and gets pretty tedious.His points could have been put succinctly in 50 pages, instead it gets dragged out for far too long.Disappointing."
3,Good for retail businesses,"There is a lot of hype on this book. I found it to be interesting and contains some good advice for small business owners. However, you can't ""McDonaldize"" every business. Retail - sure. But try doing that with a professional service business, or a manufacturin business. Only some of the concepts apply. The main message - get yourself out of the day to day of running the business and that you should work ON the business and not IN it is very good advice. This book just doesn't tell you how to do that unless you are in a retail environment."
1,Way to much fluff,"I cannot for the life of me understand why this book gets so many four star reviews, except to say three words, ""paid reviews perhaps"". This book was full of generalities and fluff. I may have gotten a few ideas, but not enough to justify the price. His push for buying a franchise instead of going it alone, I really have to question, as the failure rate for franchises these days is extremely high. All in all, this book was just not worth it. You would do better to simply read any of the latest blogs on this subject for free."
5,Great book!,I've started my own business and was recommended this book by my instructor. It is a really good book for the 'lay' business person like me! It really tells you how to think about working in your business and not for it. Very good information! I would recommend this book!
4,Incredibly relevant,OK so you may think that even though this book was published in 1995 that it is no longer current.Even though your top-of-the-line smartphone is obsolete in 2-weeks there are some things that stay current and that's how this book is written. If you are readingThe Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful BusinessesorThe Wall Street Journal. Complete Small Business Guidebookthis book will complement if perfectly.I'm not going to give away any spoilers but if you have any interest in business this book is great.
5,Excellent Guide for Small Business Owners!,"This book was recommended to me since my husband and I are starting a new business. What a GREAT book! Gives awesome advice regarding how to mentally approach starting a new business, as well as how to continue running the business with balance and effectiveness. I would highly recommend this book to anyone starting or running a small business."
1,Spelled S-U-C-K-E-R,"Having worked for an organization that enrolled in the E Myth program, I can attest that this nothing more than ""By my product"" garbage. Taking the idea of ""systems"" to a degree which demeans employees and tramples individual contribution may work at mickey dees but does not work with professionals. Sorry if you got suckered and wasted a nickel on this hippie burn out."
5,"If you do not read this book, I wonder how you might succeed","For years, I tried to run a small and make it succesful, until I read this book and began aplying some ot the concepts that Mr. Gerber gives. You should read it and try it to, I tell you that this book will change the way you think about running a small business and most likely, will change your life."
2,This is the book people rave about?,"The premise of the book is pretty good, and could have been accomplished in 40 pages. The unctuously written self help narrative of the book is targeted at morons, seemingly. I skimmed this as fast as possible extracted a few choice nuggets and moved on. Wish I could get some of that time back in my life...."
1,The book flap was enough...,...to get a feel for the revised edition. The first one was great but very little was added to this one to make it a good buy. But why take stock in my opinion - I'm an idiot anyway.BE
5,The E-Myth Revisited,"I highly recommend this book. I am a businessman and currently I own two small businesses. Since originally reading this book years ago I find myself buying copies for friends, associates and one person I just met between flights. After they read the book they tell me it is as if it was written about them, just as I felt. Once you get your small business running it is quite difficult to understand how the focus of your effort and your role in the business needs to change. This book helps you realize what your role should be and how to go about getting there. If you are like most small businessmen, working to many hours putting out fires instead of guiding the ship, this book will give you real world inspiration and guidance that you can actually apply.Regards,Al Johnson Jr -CPMR"
5,A Book to Success in your Small Business,Excellent book to help you achieve success in all areas of small business. Get the principles shown here and avoid the mistakes described too. Apply them and get the sucess you want in your business. Highly recommended.
3,A good read for private business owners,"The E-Myth is a good read for small business owners. It's getting a little bit out dated now. But, it was one of the leading entrepreneur books in it's day and a lot of the lessons outlined in the book still apply.I'd recommend this book to any business owner who likes to read. However, if you are only going to read one or two books this year, I'd suggest you look for books with newer publication dates.Some suggestions inculude:Cashflow Quadrant: Rich Dad's Guide to Financial FreedomThe Business Coach (Instant Success) (Instant Success)Billionaire In Training (Instant Success)"
2,"""Sweet"" story gets tacky at times","Great concepts, principles, approach for making your small business successful. Too bad it's all buried in a lengthy dialogue with a friend called Sarah, who nearly collapsed under the burden of building a pie baking business. Of course there's a happy ending where Sarah ""gets it"" and lives happily ever after."
3,Useful advice mixed with cheap pulp,"Even though I don't feel the ambition of growing to become a fortune 500 multinational, the authors advice to see my business as the prototype of a future-franchise is still very interesting, Ill give him that. But he should stick to business advice and not at the same time try to turn this book into a novel!So mr. Gerber, if you intend to write more books: please get to the point quickly (remember, we're all business people) and don't stray towards poetry!"
1,Audio version is dreadful - BOOK is great!,"I have given the lowest possible rating to the cassette version of this book. It is abridged - poorly! Very boring and sounds like an infomercial for his services rather than the inspiring, sound information of the book. VERY DISAPPOINTED in the TAPED VERSION!"
1,Only an outline. Not much meat on the tape,"I was very dissappointed in the audio version. Having never read the book and hearing lots of raves, I was expecting much more. He gave a very breif outline, then spent the last 5 minutes in an advertisement to hire his company.Very dissappointing. Maybe the book is better."
5,E-Myth,"For me this book was like a light bulb switching on. Gerber shows a way of looking at a business like a smooth running machine, with all parts systemised for efficiency. A great book that every business owner should read. If Gerbers philosophies are implemented they transform businesses quickly into profit machines that run with minimal effort.Well worth a read!Shaun BrodisonAuthorSecrets to Effective Weight Loss"
3,Self-promoting,"Pros: Some excellent points, especially re the need for systems/standardization, documentation, training and metrics. Cons: 1) Assumptions that a) the only valid reason for starting a small business is to create a ""franchise"" that you can eventually sell and b) the only way to grow a business is through outside financing. 2) The book felt like a self-promotion piece selling the e-myth process and consulting services. 3) No index."
4,Getting the Small Business Basics,I bought this book because it was recommended by the person who was helping me do a tune up for my business. I never would have purchased it on my own because the title led me to believe it was about misconceptions people have about the internet. I'm glad I did read it because it lays out the essential things every small business owner has to have in place to be successful.
3,Great Information but.... Get to the Point!!!,"This book contains terrific suggestions on automating your business. However, the author fancies himself a master crafter or words and creative fiction. Would have preferred that he just got to the point. In fact, each of the E-Myth books could have been easily summarized in a powerful magazine article of 3,000 words. Instead, the material is just stretched out to 200 plus pages. Despite this, the ideas are powerful and certainly worth a read."
1,very poor content and bad tales,He writes alot to explain some vague thoughts.The writing style is telling stories that PRETEND to be philosophycal.It could be written in less than 10 pages.
4,Identifies the code - but doesn't crack it for you.,"I have launched three service business and can absolutely confirm Michael is right on the money. He identifies the 'code' to enabling your business to grow successfully. After reading this book, I am changing the direction of my 6 year old consulting firm, since I now know that it is not exactly scalable. Michael gives you enough ammunition to identify the challenges to growing profitably and gives you general methods for 'modeling' your business. If you are a service provider, this book along with Michael Port's ""Book Yourself Solid"" is a power one-two punch."
5,brings to life the journey of business development,"Michael Gerber's insights about the challenges confronting the small business owner are brought to life by his ""running dialogue with a wonderful woman named Sarah(not her real name)."" Using examples from Sarah's enterprise - All About Pies - Gerber brings to life the journey of business development.From the opening chapters which explore The Entrepreneurial Myth and the Fatal Assumption to the ""nuts and bolts"" chapters in Part III, Gerber draws the reader along with great anticipation. Business owners will recognize themselves as they read about the problems caused by the three people in one -- the Technician, the Manager and the Entrepreneur. Not only will there be recognition, there will be laughter.With specific ""how to"" examples combined with the insights about why things must change, Gerber has created a powerful guide for the development of a business that can really give the owner the life often dreamed about."
5,Life changing book,"This book is a must read for ANYBODY who has a bright idea and wants to create a business out of it. This book completely changed my view of the business world, from that of a 'technician' to having a more holistic view. I have purchased this book many times as a gift for people that I know are thinking of getting into business. HIGHLY recommended!"
3,Good Basic Small Business Owners Guide,"This book gives you the basics you need to run your own small business. Im not sure the author's frequent interations with the female character, who has ""done all the wrong"" things in her business is effective, but it beats just listing strategies needed to be successful. I bought this book since it was recommended reading by the folks who sell Quiznos franchises, but it can be used by any small business venture."
5,How business can avoid failing..,"Mr. Gerber does a find job of outlining why most small businesses fail and how to avoid the same plight. Though, this is not a technical read, it is a good first step to a way of thinking that is invaluable to management success.-pres.[...]"
1,"Don't waste your time or money on this ""Myth""","This book is simply a plug for Gerber's ""E-Myth Academy"", and is a poor excuse for a business development guide. After suffering through over 250 pages of puffery I could hardly extract one or two basic business concepts (concepts, that were covered in greater lengths in an introductory business class during freshman year as an undergrad). On a positive note, I will say that ""Dr"" Gerber has devised a clever franchising scheme for his ""methods"" and is an excellent saleman. But, I do feel that his skills are best applied on a used car lot."
1,"padded, badly written, fake example","I agree with the other one- and two-star reviews.As well:* the book is clearly padded, using a large font and lots of paragraph breaks.* his ""Sarah"" narrative is grandiose, smarmy, fakey, idealized, and annoying.His points could have been clearly explained in a pamphlet. A SMALL pamphlet. It would have made him less money, though.Thank God I got this book from the library, rather than paying for it."
4,"More ""touchy-feely"" than your usual business book","I was given this book by by employer, upon notice of my resignation to start my own company. He felt that after I read it I would no longer want to be an entrepenuer. WRONG! This book is not so much a ""how to"" be a manager (though it does give some very specific guidelines) as it is a psychological look at entrepenuers - what works, what doesn't, how to get yourself in the correct frame of mind to proceed. How you - the entrepenuer - need to need to look at the business in order to be successful - so that you can run the company, instead of it running you.I gained a lot of insight from this book. I did feel it was very wordy, and really warm-fuzzy (Sarah wants her pies to show she cares - Sarah wants her spirit to be free - the author cares about Sarah AND her spirit, yada yada yada). Other than a few strange digressions, I found it very enjoyable and I believe it will be helpful."
4,"A little long-winded, but awesome!","The ideas the author conveys in this book are valuable, to say the least. Everyone who is thinking of starting or has started their own business needs to read this book. I just wish he would get to the point a little quicker. I found myself skimming ahead to find where he starts talking about the real issues again, instead of telling us a long, drawn out story. But still a must read. By implementing his ideas in my company, I'm sure I will save myself many headaches down the road, maybe even avoiding failure."
2,Avoid if you bore easily,"This book may be lauded by professionals and amateurs alike, but the author is so god-awfully wordy that I couldn't get beyond the second chapter. I actually tossed it across the room in frustration--which I NEVER do to a book. It reads like an infomercial or sales letter where the main tactic is interminable repetition. If the redundancies were removed, it would be one-third to one-half its current length--and a MUCH better book.I'm disappointed that frustration and boredom will not allow me to get to the excellent lessons I've heard it contains. Perhaps the author could give it over to a good proofreader or editor for condensing and offer us a third version."
5,Excellent book for the closely held business owner,"I found several very helpful concepts in this book, which in my opinion make it well worth the cost. The author does promote the ""franchise"" model, but states that readers do not have to actually franchise their business, but they must think about their business as if they were going to franchise it. His point appears to be that what business owners must do is develop the business into a model that could, if desired, be replicated. This inherently requires a discipline about the business that will substantially improve it."
4,Eye opening and easy to read,"Using the insights of the book into my everyday corporate job! We need standardized processes and without them too much time is wasted on recreating the wheel not enabling workers to focus on the important things (service, follow-up, etc.). Easy reading and insightful!"
4,Eye-opening,"He chooses an extremely corny device as a hook to get readers through his premise, but what a premise it is: Entrepreneurs spend too much working IN their business, rather than working ON their business. It's a great concept. I've recommended this book to at least 10 people, who've actually gone out and bought copies for their friends, and so on and so on. If it weren't for the hokey concept, this book would definitely qualify as a 10."
4,The E-Myth Revisited CD : Why Most Small Businesses Don't Work and What to do about it,"The E-Myth Revisited CD set by Michael E. Gerber was long and kind of boring. But... it has some great ideas and if you can hang in there and take the time to listen, it has many great ideas for any business.I asked a friend of mine that is very successful in business what single book he would recommend, he said E-Myth by Michael E. Gerber. He reads a lot of book and is very successful, so I thought I would purchase the CD set to listen while I was driving.It has very good ideas; companies need to put in place systems and processes to be the most successful. Probably the best idea that I got out of the book was, ""Go to work ON you business not IN your business"". This single idea is very powerful and a key to any successful business owner or sales professional's success.Scott MarkerMSA founderwww.mixedsellingarts.com"
4,"Good Book, Opens Your Eyes","E-Myth Revisited CD is a great audio book. For those of you that have a small business that is in trouble, this book is for you. Gerber gives some real insight into what it takes to successfuly grow a business. You have to put together systems that work every time. Run your small business like a large business. Spend time working on your business rather than in it. An important concept that Gerber talks about is this: The product of your business is not what you sell, it's how your customers feel after doing business with you. I really enjoyed this book and have recommended it to others. It could have been a little shorter, but still very good."
3,Nice try,"The book starts out good, you get an idea of what a business is, however he takes way too much time and detail to give you the information you need to move on. Also was not really happy with trying to get my own business running by myself. He assumes everyone wants a chain of business or many employees. I don't!"
4,Interesting,"It's very interesting, but a bit difficult to associate the contents with an actual situation.I wish it was simpler for an amateur like me."
3,A few powerful ideas. Lots of fluff.,"This book has a high rating because it really does contain a couple very powerful ideas for the small business owner.My problem with this book is that those ideas could be presented in about 4 or 5 chapters, maximum. A fair portion of the 18 chapters of this book is pure fluff. Especially toward the end, where some of the chapters were complete zeroes. I suppose the author had to pad it out for the publisher to make it look like a serious business book. Furthermore, this author has what I'd call a high word-to-data ratio. I've read few books where so many words are used to say so little.Probably worth reading for the good ideas contained, but be prepared to be frustrated by all the gloss you have to wade through."
1,A few descent concepts within a lot of Huff and Fluff,"There are about a dozen pages throughout this book with useful information on them. The rest is just Gerber rambling on about his business philosophies. Most of the book is just generalized concepts, which were not very useful because there were very few examples to back them up. Additionally, his writing style is extremely annoying (other reviews give examples), especially the dialog between him and his made-up Sarah character, which unfortunately runs throughout the whole book. My suggestion is to just read the reviews which summarize the main concepts of the book, rather than wasting your time reading the book. Either way, you will learn the same amount."
5,"The ""light"" came on when I read this book!","After many years working with small businesses as a CPA, I can attest to the fact that Gerber's right on the money for identifying why most small businesses fail.Having systems which keep the owners and employees focused on the goals and visions of the company are very much lacking in many small businesses.It is truly liberating to see ideas which lay out the key areas of good business management. None of these ideas are new, it's just the genius that Gerber uses to organize his material which makes it very practical to use and to internalize.I think every small business owner should read it. If they do, learning to improve their business will come much more routine and part of their natural thinking process."
2,Sift Carefully,"Gerber makes a few very insightful points in this book, especially early on. However, as he progresses they become fewer and more obscure. He gradually deteriorates into a new age/zen rhapsody and becomes increasingly unclear, inconsistent, and wrong. Even some of his more lucid points require hard swallowing or careful synthesis. He then closes with a poorly veiled plug for hiring his e-institute to fill in the blanks, which have mushroomed by then."
2,Useless and irritating,"The author's 'great insight' is that most people who start small businessesare technicians, i.e., they understand the mechanics of their trade but not how torun a business. Fair enough. The solutions offered up, however, are simplistic,general and formulaic. (Any McDonald's franchise pack has more useful informationin it.) There really is nothing of substance in it.The E Myth is written in the conversational style of a self-help book, in anauseatingly self satisfied way. The author also creates his own languageand terminology, as if he had discovered a new and exciting science, and what makes thisespecially annoying (not to mention cynical) is that the language is obviously specificto his consultancy. A deeply irritating book."
3,Some Good Ideas Here,"The author describes his younger years (0-40) as a wandering neer-do-well who could not keep a job or a wife for long, and then sort of fell into whatever he is doing now. He never ran a business until he started his consulting business -- where he tells people how to run their businesses. Gerber loves the franchise form of business, where the new franchisee goes to ""Hamburger U"" and learns every detail of running a burger shop. My business (a wine distributor) is not a burger shop. Something new pops up every day, and it's not in the operating manual. That said, the book is worth the short time it takes to read it. I took some good ideas from the book and plan to try implementing them in some form in my business."
3,Good going Mike!,You have come a long way from selling encyclopedias. Whom would have thought you would have converted those great selling skills and turn them into what you have. Good work!
5,Great information,"An easy read with lots of great advice. The ""tell a story"" format made the examples easy to remember long after the book was closed."
3,Interesting book if you are considering a new business...,"I found Gerber's premise that a business should be organized and run like a franchise very interesting. However, I don't think this is possible in every case.Gerber wants the owner to reduce every aspect of his business to a system--one that even a high school student could understand. This is fine for McDonalds where every transaction is repetitive, but what kind of system is possible in a business that doesn't rely on repeat customers and/or where every transaction is somewhat different?IMO, the real value of The Emyth is for people who are considering starting a business--it may give them a different perspective about what is in store for them as a business owner. For an established business I don't see a lot of practical or useful information."
2,Good information if you can find it,"The overall message and information in this book is great..... if you can wade through all the extra narrative overkill. I thought this was supposed to be a business book. Sure, keep it exciting with stories and dialogue but this was death by unnecessary words."
4,A Must for Small Business Students,"E-Myth Revisited was assigned to me as a class reading project. I read slowly, so I purchased the book on CD. The material ties together everything a business student learns in coursework and brings the concepts to life in real-world examples. E-Myth provides very sound advice in a no-nonsense fashion. The reader/author's voice is a little hypnotic, which makes me sleepy, but fortunately I could ""rewind"" as needed and listen to everthing I missed. I love being able to do little chores while I listen to books, so the format is perfect. I would recommend all business students from any concentration read or listen to E-Myth revisited. Amazon hooked me up amazingly fast so my book report will be on time for sure."
5,Must read for any small business owner,"Get focused, master the basics and make your small business successful. This book can be a little boring to read, but keep going and practice what you learn. Work ON your business not IN it and create a successful enterprise. Unless you slave in your small business for ""fun"" this book contains the steps to make your business work for you."
5,The Best Business Book I Ever Read,"If you read 1 business book and one business book only, This is the one!It completely changed the way I look at building a business. It is incredible from start to finish.Very clear, methodical and exhilarating. I am recommending it to all my friends."
4,Great book on Entrepreneurship,Read before you even think of starting your own business. Its not as easy as you might think
5,great asset for small business owners,i was at a business conference and the facillitator mentioned this book. well i have had numerous motivational books that i have bought but i thought one more can't hurt. so i purchased e-myth and it turned out to be not only motivational but reality. i now do my business according to some of the suggestions provided in the book and i am gaining great results. a must read for small home business owners.
3,Simplistic but valuable,"Gerber presents an easy to digest presentation directed toward all the ""Technicians"" who want to stop working for others and start their own businesses. Because all the points are introduced in the context of a flailing new business owner trying to save her business before it's too late, a structure for relating to them is created. Unfortunately, the simplicity of the presentation does not permit any depth for point development. Nonetheless, the idea of putting everything a new business needs to consider into a turn-key, franchise-like approach is a very useful way to see ways to make a small business successful."
4,Excellent Advice,"This book is a must for all small business owners. Gerber breaks things down to the basics and reminds us all of why we went into business for ourselves in the first place. Whether you're a new business owner, thinking about starting one, or have owned one for decades, this book will speak to your life. Not only will your business be more profitable, but your life will improve as you practice the advice given."
5,MUST READ before opening a small business,"Easy read.Simple, but very logical and profound advise every person should hear before opening a small business."
2,Old Ideas Which Should Scare You,"""The business model should be such that the employees needed possess the lowest possible level of skill necessary to fulfill the functions for which each is intended.""If you are a small business owner and appreciate the above quote from 'The E-Myth Revisited' then you have a MacDonalds philosphy. This being that I can always find someone to take a low compensated employee's place. They are easy to find and hire. Small business owner, you have become what America started with the industrial revoluation. We will take care of you if you do exactly what we tell you to do. Oh yes, we will also lay you off when the economy sucks and you can be quickly replaced based on our discretion.Or could you become a small business owner that follows the new paradigms of leadership that encourages employees to think on their own; add value by listening to their creative, new, how to improve their role or company suggestions which by-the-way, increases your bottom line."
2,Should have been another reader,I think that it should not have been the author that was reading. He reads on a monotone level and makes it difficult to follow or not fall asleep.The book could also have been half the size that it was. The message is simple and that is build a system that you can duplicate.
1,Not the best business book on the shelf,"This is simply a very poor book on the subject of small business. Basically, Gerber tells you that you need to franchise your business. That may be well and good, but what if you have a business that doesn't lend itself to franchising, like consulting? After reading his book I felt as though I wasted my time. I also felt mislead. Because of the title I thought I going to read a book chock full of tips on how to run your small business better and which pitfalls to avoid. Instead, I was treated to Gerber's horn blowing interlaced with a story about a woman he consulted and her pies. My advice is to look elsewhere for business advice."
3,A mellow reading from the aged Monteux,"By 1962 the venerable Pierre Monteux was 87, and although he could still produce memorable performances, his energies were flagging, naturally enough. This reading of Berlioz's Romeo and Juliet is relaxed and mellow, and there's more than a touch of Monteux's grace in French music. But to be candid, it's underpowered and at times tired-sounding. The soloists are fine, but with the conductor giving them little reason to apply drama to their parts, they fall into the prevailing mood. The LSO likewise is in good but not memorable form. In all, this beloved conductor was caught about a decade too late in a work that very much suited his natural gifts."
2,Ours lasted six months,Ours lasted six months before dying. That's still a lot to pay for six months' worth of use.
1,It died in one month,Unfortunately this toothbrush died completely after about a month. I have not tried to get it replaced because I haven't had the time so I can't comment on how a return worked.
2,3 strikes and out,I've had three of these and my last one just died after only 8 months of use. The last two got where they would not shut off unless you put it on the charger; the switch would not turn it off so picture this; squirting toothpaste in your mouth first then trying to push it around in your mouth while you brush. When the toothbrush works they are great but I'm done.
1,"Oral B ""POS"" is possessed","I was really excited about the timer on my Oral B...it reminded me just how long I really needed to brush...just before THE POSSESSION OF THE ORAL B. Imagine how you'd feel when you blithely went to turn off your toothbrush only to find that it would NOT shut off! All the poking, pushing and cajoling didn't help. After 5 minutes of trying everything to disable the brush I bashed its brains out on the tub...then it began to squeal and whine...struggling to stay alive! Was it searching for Linda Blair!?!?! Remember ""JOHNNY 5""???......""no disassemble!!!!!!!!!!!"" I finally administered the coup de grace by ripping out the wiring...at last, dead quiet...I deep sixed the remains, fearful they would reassemble themselves in some demented Sorcerer's Toothbrush scene.This is the second electric toothbrush that has failed me...I'm using a $3.99 Crest electric which I can either throw away or return to my local Wal-Mart. My soul just can't take another Oral B meltdown."
3,Actually 3 1/2 stars is more appropriate,"All I can say is wow, I think I'll be reading more Tim Waggoner. His writing style is fast paced, descriptive and interesting. The book is about Damara, a woman with a terrible power that makes people's dreams/nightmares come to life. This power has caused her to become a loner, hiding away in the house she shares with her mother for 17 years. However her powers, for whatever reason, has begun to leak out into the neighbourhood and it leads to frightening results. I would tell people to read this book, it's interesting and creative. Waggoner has been added to my list of authors to watch out for."
2,"Great Visuals, Story Was Mediocre at Best","While I am a fan of both the genre and the author, this book seemed as if Waggoner took twenty of the 'disturbing vignettes' that had been kicking around in his head and wrote them all into one book. There were certainly some fantastic gruesome visuals, but no compelling storyline connecting them."
4,Starts slow but emerges into all out gore-fest,"This is a book that started out so quietly I feared I'd have to give it up but then it evolved into a full out gore-filled horror novel reminiscent of Richard Laymon (lots of sex related gore and grossness). It crept up so quietly that I was a little stunned which is a good thing because I'm too easily bored lately.Damara cannot allow her imagination to run wild because even the most innocent of daydreams can often have deadly consequences. She's suppressed her imagination for years and lives the life of a shut-in. But her power has started to seep into the lives of her neighbors and all h*ll is breaking lose.This book was gruesome and then some. Yikes, this guy is right up there with the likes of Ed Lee for the gore factor. I had to put it aside because it was so bad at one point but, of course, I just had to go back and read it. Awful, nightmarish and completely horrific stuff. Recommended only for those with strong stomachs."
1,Total Garbage!,"This author has issues! This book is sick, twisted, and just plain disgusting! I'm glad I got it for free....I threw it away as soon as I was done with it!"
5,Not the best....,....but not bad either. Nothing stands up to Loverboy's first two discs.Loverboy/Get Luckyare also available as BGO's remasters here on Amazon as a two-disc set). They're in a class all by themselves. But these remasters sound good.
4,Decent Sea Nutrients Supplement,"I find the product to be somewhat Ideal. I have taken it before some long time ago. That time I had purchased it from a health food store and I remember they had nothing but good things to say about it. I give a bottle to my son who is 12 and I also have a bottle to myself for the month. I would say the only drawback that I noticed from reading the ingredients is that it says it has fructose which to me seems that it is saying it contains fructose corn syrup which I do not consider that healthy so that is the only thing that would make me consider getting a different one next time. That's it. Otherwise, I find it to be really good content."
1,No measurable amount of coral calcium. Undisclosed ingredients ...,"The label says it has Coral Calcium. The list on the back says it has Coral Calcium, but it does not say how much which indicates it's a trace, at best.I did not expect to find silver, cadmium, etc. on the ingredient list. I thought there would be seaweed, but there's not.Once again, a problem that stems from Amazon having no requirements that sellers list ingredients. And, in this case, it is compounded by Arizona (where this product is manufactured) not requiring adequate info. on the product label (no amounts, no sources). This is an unsafe product for me to use.I liked shopping for supplements on Amazon when you could get the info about the product. This is absurd. I was looking for a liquid coral calcium supplement. The reviews made it sound like this product was exactly that. It is not!"
2,Not good quality,We typically buy OEM kits but I thought I'd give a refurb a try. This was very lacking and we received less than half the copies we would normally get on a brand new kit. Not a happy camper.
3,It's ok for the price.,"I own a few JTL lights, and overall I think they are a decent brand. The JTL SL-160 seemed like a nice light for about 2 years (about 400 flashes + or - a hundred). On a side note; I've always thought lamps should have flash counters. But anyway, then the sensor at times didn't seem to initiate, and the modeling lamp would smoke intermittently. I still use this lamp from time to time, and you could say I got my moneys worth, but I would not buy this item used from anyone unless it was real cheap. The dolly, jib arm, and soft-box are great and I use them with other lights often."
3,Soundtracker,"This was a little bit of a let-down for a few reasons.Firstly, the production quality is lacking in many departments and leaves the viewer wanting. This is a documentary about sound, and the audio throughout is repeatedly noisy and affected by wind; simple precautions and better mic placement would have prevented this.Secondly the camera work is awful. The zoomy, choppy attempting to find the target shots take away from the viewing experience. In addition there is not enough material to merit the 120 minutes in length, either in exposition or narrative flow.Overall it feels like an amateur production, and there is just no justification for that in a market saturated with quality DSLR documentaries viewable for free on Vimeo."
1,Menocet purchase,Did not look like the Menocet I purchase locally. Wonder if it really was Menocet. Took it once and got a terrible headache so threw the rest away.
4,Hummmm ...,They were what I had ordered But on the back of the packs in bigletters were SAMPLES. So if you don't mind giving ten dollarsplus s/h to someone for samples that's ok.Other than that they are good.
2,brief results,This product only worked for about 3 months. After that the hot flashes and night sweats were back with a vengeance.
2,Poor product quality,"I ordered the first three seasons on DVD because I am a huge TVD fan, and received my order on time. However, I was very upset to find that the case for the season 2 box set had a large slash in the plastic protection screen on the actual case, that began on the front of the case in the top right corner and ended on the back of the case in the middle. The discs and box are fine and in new condition, but the tear on the case is upsetting. I take great care of all of my TV box sets and have never had a problem with product quality before. Either way it was very disappointing."
5,Great price!,This was a bargain on Black Friday at $12.99. It was on my daughter's wish list so with the free shipping it was a great deal.
5,easy purchase,"Love the series! I missed an episode, so I logged on a purchased it at a very inexpensive price and was an easy purchase. Quick and easy!"
5,"The Vampire Diaries, best price","I bought ""The Vampire Diaries"" The Complete Second Season.I bought before the Christmas rush.The price was the best on the "" Internet "" that I found.Buying was easy and shipping was fast.I internet shop here, ""Amazon.com"" first.ThanksPS Price was inline with other sellers 2 weeks before Christmas.PSS Shop early for the best prices at Christmas"
5,Vampire Diaries is the best!!!!,I started watching this the first season and loved it. My grand daughter wasn't interested until I let her borrow my complete 1st season> now she is hooked and says she likes it just as much as the Twilight series. Even wants to read the books. She is waiting for the 2nd season to come out on DVD because she didn't watch the first 2 episodes but won't watch it now until she can see them all. I am buying her the set so I can keep mine. This is the best and if you like vampires you will love this. I couldn't get into watching True Blood cause the characters were not how I thought they would be and the character Sookie tries to hard with the southern accent and she just doesn't fit my idea as the character.
3,Interesting playback,"Playback of DVD's was a little questionable. They would start out playing then go blank. My daughter had just watched all of season one (from Amazon) with no problem on her computer. To defend the product, we did play them in DVD player and they worked. Maybe it was just the computer, although the computer plays other DVD's just fine."
5,vamps,This is season 2. I have season 1 and 3 they are all good. I am waiting on season 4. When it comes out I will purchase it.
5,Love this show!,"I am a big fan of twilight, and true blood on HBO, so I thought I would give this a try and I'm hooked, I even have my husband liking it!"
5,love it,These series are the best. I am excited about the fourth series coming out on dvd. It is going to be awesome.
5,Love This Show!,"Alright, so I want to review this without giving into the vampire love bias that has possessed a good portion of the female race. When it comes down to it this show is spectacular. The writing improves more and more that you don't even think about how weak it was the first few episodes anymore. The acting...is better than you'd expect coming from a young adult CW show. The cast is gorgeous (Ian Somerhalder is the best part of the show). Can't wait for next season I see myself watching this show all the way to the end."
4,Vamp Vamp Review,I bought the Vampire Diaries DVD and it came quickly :) but on of the DVDs had a slight scratch on it.
5,best show on television,"Vampire Diaries is easily the best show on television right now. No other show has such exciting episodes with no filler. The second season was just as good as the first, probably better. The dvd features are fun and entertaining. Can't ask for anything more!"
5,Great Show,I was happy that this was at a reasonably price. I have enjoyed watching it and have just ordered the third season.
5,Love those young Vampires,Have really enjoyed all of the Vampire Diaries series and have bought all of the seasons that have came out. Will enjoy these in the future when the Vampire Diaries series is no longer on TV and I need my vampire fix.
3,It's Okay.,It's Okay. It has its boring moments but I was ok in the beginning. I'm not watching it much now.
1,couldnt watch,I couldnt watch this video because it kept cutting off so it was so difficult to watch I just stopped watching it . The video would stop every 30-45 seconds so it made watching the movie impossible So I have no idea what I was watching at all
4,Christmas gift for dtr.,Product received timely. No discount awared although asked due to lower pricing elsewhere. Would have loved a lowering pricing. Unable to provide a 5 star rating as I am not a vampire watcher
3,"Awesome show, but poor quality blurays","Season 2 of the Vampire Diaries is awesome! The only reason for 3/5 stars is because some scenes are not filmed in high definition and appear very fuzzy in bluray. Sound is great, only have a problem with the picture. I have tried it with different TVs, different HDMI cables, and different bluray players. It's definitely from the discs. I wish it were better quality since I opted for the blurays over the DVDs. The first season blurays I bought were better quality. I will be buying the Vampire Diaries in DVD format from now on."
5,Great,"After a perfect first season, the challenge was big and it's well done, as good as the first one. Let's hope the 3 will be as good"
5,Great episode,I can't wait until the next episode. I CANNOT believe that Jenna is in transition to be a vampire. The series just keeps getting better and better.
5,DVDs The Vampire Diaries,I love the Vampire Diaries. The shows don't follow the books exactly (the books are a little darker) but the shows are really good.
5,absolutely love it!,We are a vampire diaries family! we love this series and can't wait for season 3 to come out on blu ray..
5,Wonderfully Perfect,"High Definition; All Episodes; Comentaries & Deleted Scenes! Highly Recommend!it's all that you could have asked for. I only wished it came with the deleted scenes (bloopers), but other than that it's a great product."
5,Great!,"The vampire diaries is one of my all time favorite television series, I think the new episodes have gotten cheesy, but season 2 is the best! Nicely packaged, and great to watch over and over again."
4,A Christmas Gift,"This was given as a christmas gift, however, the person I gave it to loved it and has added it to their DVD library."
5,Vampire Diares2,"product in great condition, it arrived when it was suppost to.did not have to worry about buying in a store where it cost way more then Amazon charged, will for sure by again."
5,good!,this was a really good show. Katherine is in the tomb and Elena trys to get answers and Stephan trys to tell Elena that it is lies but Elena doesn't think it is and she trys to tell that to Stephan but he just putting her down this episode had very good potential
5,"Great episode, but the ending sucked","The episode was great, but the statement Damon made about letting the witch die to save elena was nasty. There was great chemistry between Damon and Bonnie, but I guess that was all an illusion."
5,"BEST OF THE BEST EPISODES , ""WOW""","This episode was great. I cannot believe that poor Jenna is dead. I felt sympathy for John, who was a jerk, but turned out to be really good guy. Damon is dying from the wolf bite. Each episode just keep getting better and better. Again ""WOW""."
4,Great Episode,This was an excellent episode. It wasn't predictable and left a lot of questions yet to be answered. Wonderful werewolf transformation segment.
2,disapointing,disappointed with the color I was hoping for brighter colors but I did not return it because each handbag is supposedly unique so the chance of getting something more colorful was probably not going to happen
2,DISAPPOINTING,"Whilst it collects a number of his best recordings for Capitol, this Johnny Otis collection falls well short of Ace's far superior comp of Otis' Capitol years - ""The Greatest Johnny Otis Show"" - also available from Amazon. After track 17, the unissued material, which makes up the balance of the CD, is pure padding and probably should have remained unissued. No complaints with the sound quality, however I'm not sure what the compiler was thinking when he arrived at the line-up for this set, as he's clearly missed the opportunity to match it with the package from Ace.Only for completists of Johnny Otis."
1,Just Have to Knock This One,"We normally love Dora the Explorer, but this video is marred by a dangerous message -- I would not recommend buying it. Dora encounters a giant who tells her he is sad b/c he has lost his puppy and she helps him find it and encourages the kids to do the same. Hello?! As other reviewers have noted, such stories have been used as ploys by predators to lure children. Although I used the opportunity to tell my 5 year old that Dora actually did not make a safe choice there and she should never do anything like that, young children are so impressionable that I wish she had not seen it in the first place."
2,Not a spanish soundtracks,"Personnaly, I think the main advantage of Dora is to teach mu Daughter spanish, not just ""vamonos"". I am therefore looking for DVDs with the actual full Spanish soundtracks with few English phrases like ""let's go"".Amazon does a poor job at distingishing the actual soundtrack. Although this one says ""Spanish"", it only has the English soundtrack. ""Musical school days""; ""Puppy Power"" have the Spanish soundtrack."
5,Dora is well liked,I like that Dora is a good little girl lots of cartoon characters that are female are super heros and teenagers. Dora is cute for my 3 and 6 year old. One thing I found a little odd about this dvd is that if you leave it alone it wil repeat again and again... I like to stop movies so that the kids will do other things. The kids really like that Dora goes to fairy tale land. It sort of mixes in some other stories they know. I think they feel like they share some knowledge with Dora.
5,my 2-yar old loves this DVD!,"Normally my kid is stuck on Elmo and Mickey Mouse, so I got this to broaden her horizon (and 'cause I was sick of the other DVD's), and she loves it! And it's a learning experience for her too, so I maximize the learning time in the car!"
5,Dora the Explorer - Dora's Fairytale Adventure,"I rated this DVD 5 stars for parents who have a real 'girly girl' for a daughter. My tomboy likes it, but not as much as her sister. This DVD is wonderful for my daughter when I need to keep her occupied. Dora is such a fun character for children and they seem to love the adventures through rain forests, number lake, alphabet mountain, tallest mountain and the list goes on and on. It is educational and fun at the same time. Nick Jr. certainly got the twist on Dora DVD's right. We have several DVD and review new ones from the library and then come right back to Amazon and order the ones she likes. I highly recommend purchasing several of them."
1,health hazardous,as well as watchting barney this can be very dangerous. symptons are stachaches headaches and serios back pain. i would DEFINENTLY NOT recommend this.
3,J.C. Bach Concerto NOT J.C. Bach,"The ""J.C. Bach"" concerto is really a piece by French composer, Henri Casadesus. Casadesus made a living for himself by composing works in a baroque or rococo idiom and then passing them off as works of other composers. He's also written a challenging concerto in B minor for viola, only that one Casadesus said was by Handel. Both concerti are staples for young viola students, and I studied both in my youth."
3,Not for beginners,"Having read this book half way, I believe it is intended for experienced developers instead of for beginners in device programming. Rather than offering a structural and formal introduction to the subject, it stresses on tricks and hints on selected topics like synchronization, pnp, read/write, etc.I now go for the DDK documentation for a more fundamental treatment. It cleared up instantly some of the questions built up as I read through the first five chapters of the book, like how a user mode application calls up the kernal mode driver. Nevertheless the author does give an authoritative insight in WDM programming. Incidentally, it is a matter of taste whether you like his informal writing style.As a beginner at the moment, I rated this book three stars. I might rate it differently when I returned to the book later."
2,Recommend for advanced only,"Lots of good information is in this book, but youwould have to be an experienced driver developer to understand.Only chapters 1-3 are aimed at beginners.The problem is the author jumps right into the hardest partfirst.Also, the author shows the wrong way of doing things first. Thatmakes this an extremely difficult read.Some of the topics could have been simplified.There is good examples, and software with the book. Otherwise, I wouldhave given it one star."
5,Fantastic Reading Experience,"Dennis Clay takes the reader on a lifetime tour of the experiences of a hobo. I enjoyed reading it very much. In fact, I've passed it around to several family members and friends! They find it to be great reading -- a trip on paper.This is a must-read for anyone interested in history with Dennis' touch of intrigue and fun."
5,Story is interesting,"I lived in Moses Lake, WA for some time and thoroughly enjoyed learning about this intriguing man. He was an icon of the town with his personality and collection. It was an eye opener about the days of the depression. My uncle also rode the rails looking for work."
5,"Husqvarna 455 Rancher 20"" Chainsaw","I just had a 6 way heart bypass so my son has been cutting my wood for me, but the chainsaw runs so well that it definately lives up to it`s name.I would not hesitate for a moment to buy another one just like it, it is very fast and quiet.Randy Royea"
3,455 rancher with 18 3/8 bar,"I had bought a 455 rancher with a 18 inch bar and 3/8 chain . The first day i used it the chain brake broke , then the chain keep falling off. so i bought a new aftermarket bar / not Husqvarna and that fixed that problem . I have cut about 7 cords of wood with it so far . After the 2nd or 3rd tank of gas the saw gets so it wont hardly idle. Or if i use it on a hot day the fuel boils and the saw will not run . I Bought this saw to replace my old 36 pro sthil that i bought back in 1998. and the old sthil will still out cut this new saw any day ."
1,Chain Falls off all the time.,"This saw should have a safety recall the chain falls off all the time. I went and picked up a new chain and bar installed and it still come off. I have a cheap $99 saw that still works great, the chain never falls off. I picked up this husqvarna 455 because I wanted a better saw and more power all I got was overprice junk. The chain has fallen off so many time it's not safe to use. Stay away from this brand the warranty is also a joke just like the saw. They won't cover it."
4,Great saw for the money,"So i got tired of the Poulan Pro 18"" that I had purchased...yes for $150 bucks its ok, but we need to take down a monster oak thats 39"" in dia, and there was no way that my little Poulan was going to handle that. I spent the afternoon with this saw going thru some 24"" oak and pine logs, cuts like a dream, easy on the gas and oil...doenst leak like my Poulan and has great power. I am not a pro, but this saw will do everything I need an more. I will update this after we drop the big oak, but as of now I am sold on this saw."
2,3 1/2 years to meltdown,"I've cut all my firewood going on 16 years, and have used a lot of saws. I was excited to buy this saw from the formerly reputable husky brand name. It ran beautifully for the first year, then began to deteriorate mechanically even with regular upkeep. This year the piston was shot, no compression, and fixing this problem cost the price of a new saw.I'm switching back to Stihl."
3,"Do you really need the 20""?","Let me say I love this saw. It starts easy, is in it's own right mechanically reliable, comfortable to use, and will likely give me many years of cutting. However- I went for the 20"" because it was on sale, and I just have to give it 3* because as the blade gets hot, the chain expands at a much faster rate than any 16"" saw I'm used to... and a hot chain gets loose... and well you just have to be really careful. I managed to damage my chain a few times already because of my carelessness. I would get the 16"" blade if doing it again... you don't really need a 20"" for casual work."
2,"2 weeks in already in shop, used it for a few dozem trrees","If you ever forget to unlock the chain and remove the side cover, it will not go back on. You have to take it to a service center. If you would have to hold the cover on yourself as husqvarnas website says you will end up replacing a cheap plastic chain brake handle gear for 30 bucks most likely. You will still have to bring it to a service center. Husqvarna will not cover anything with the warranty. Buy a stihl."
5,Replacement,"Had to replace my 25yr old Craftmen that went south. Did the reserch on the 455 rancher and I will tell you what...this is a dream boat. Started right up on the second pull, plan to keep it for another 25yr....GREAT SAW"
1,guinea pigs?,you cannot use these kind of toys for guinea pigs because they're spines cannot bend like hamsters.the little critters can break they're backs and such so.i will hafta rate this item 1 star but only 4 guinea pigs.but if used 4 a hamster this will be quite a delight 4 them(:
1,Do not buy this,"I would rate this lower than 1 star if I could, for retailer irresponsibility. Ferrets and guinea pigs are not animals that should be running on wheels. You cannot substitute time outside of the cage running around with this thing. If you must have a wheel, get one with a solid body. Otherwise, their feet can get caught in the bars and very easily broken. It is a very dangerous and fairly useless product for both guinea pigs and ferrets."
5,Perfect item,"This item was purchased to use for opossums to exercise in and they love it. We are wildlife rehabbers so this gets a lot of use, especially in the spring and summer, our busiest season."
2,Halfway decent children's book,"I'm not sure what I expected, but this wasn't it. The story is clear enough, but the writing style is very bland. An attempt is made at Yoda's style of speaking, but without much success. The illustrations are not quite right. There's no excitement here, either in prose or pictures.Though it's a book for kids (my guess, ages 8-12), it seems to me the small size would put off most children.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone except a Star Wars completist."
3,Cute Love Story,"Even though Ric and Anna May were only in their early thirties, their actions seemed as if they were an OLD couple. It kind of reminded me of Florida and James Evans from Good Times. I would like to have had a little more from the sex scenes, it was too old-fashion. Story ended abruptly, needed a few more chapters to sum up the storyline.Overall rating: 3.0 stars."
5,My Favorite Book,"I just love this book. I lost my first copy and have been searching for some years to replace it. I was so happy to find it here. I have read this book 4 times. I love the characters, the friendship they have and then the love they created. Great book!"
5,Disney Biography from Amazon,"Fantastic for book reports or general information. I used this same book when I was a child, and after much research it turned out to be the best book today for my daughter to use! Easy to read, entertaining. Definitely the best choice."
3,Book for children,"I thought it was a book for adults, but it is meant for children (Maybe 10 - 14 years old). Interesting info..."
4,walt disney bio,This book is perfect for 3rd and 4th grade students. My students enjoyed the anecdotes about Walt's childhood. I liked that it was meaty enough to encourage discussion. The book also includes a section of fabulous photographs of Walt Disney and some early Disney characters. It does not include much info about the Walt Disney Company after Walt's death in the early 1960's.
3,Very Uncomfortable,"I can only wear these headphones for about 30 minutes before they become too uncomfortable. The band is very tight and presses the cups into my ears. I imagine this will be a problem for most adults, as I have a fairly narrow head.The sound is pretty decent, but whenever I use the microphone I can hear a constant hissing in the background."
4,Good Could use some comfort,"Quality of the headset is great, sounds wonderful. I find I don't use the SRS very often if at all. The comfort of them could be a little more improved, i've had it for a while now and it really hasn't improved a whole lot. It's not bad until after about 2-3 hours, but for those of us that play long periods of time it gets annoying."
4,2nd pair - Altec Lansing,"My second pair of Altec Lansing headphones. Loved my first pair but rolled over cord to many times so I wanted to replace with same name brand. These were a step up from older pair, which I had used a lot over 3 years. Comfortable, full ear cover. Great for gaming & voice over IP. Love the controls, volume and mic/mute control.Only con is you need 1-AAA battery for the ""surround sound booster"", which you can turn on & off at will. Found that it has to be on for mic use, headphones will still work. Tip: don't forget to turn off when not using or you will kill the battery. Not a big fan of needing and replacing batteries for a pair of headphones."
4,Great audio quality - not quite surround sound,"This headset makes listening to any kind of music really enjoyable. The SRS boost is a nice feature, but serves more to amplify sounds, rather than give a total surround sound effect. Either way I still use the SRS, it makes almost every song sound better.The inline volume control, and housing for the AAA battery required for the SRS boost is clunky making this headset a pain sometimes. The circuit board inside the housing will most likely break after a few drops, or smashes off a computer chair."
5,Not for Republicans,"I can understand why supporters of the Bush administration would be infuriated by this book. But if you're an independent or a democrat who likes political thrillers and doesn't feel that your own beliefs and hypocrisies are being savaged, then this page-turner will keep you thoroughly engaged and annoy the hell out of whoever else is in the room when you interrupt to read passages aloud. Much of the plot action requires a suspension of disbelief (as with most thrillers, I think), but the politically related commentary is as scary as. . . well, Wolfowitz or Cheney or the prez's faith-based foreign policy. Despite a somewhat weak ending, I found this book to be terrifically entertaining."
5,Worth waiting ten years for!,"I have four novels by LB, and since ""American Hero"", have trawled Amazon periodically for the next one. For years, nothing. Imagine my joy when ""The Librarian"" popped up in response to what I by then felt was a quixotic request. I clicked, it came, I loved it and shared it with two librarian friends who loved the limelight and the hero role as well as the high octane politics and wonderful dialogue. He is so very good and I'm back to checking his name for the next ten years. I recommend anyone who likes good writing to do the same."
3,Took a chance,"Plods along, haven't finished it yet , I read something else and come back to it. I'll Finnish it someday."
1,"Based on Wag the Dog, not the Librarian","I settled in for a good read, then saw in the notes that this book is based on the ""Wag the Dog"". I'm going to pass for now, I thought this was based on ""The Librarian"" series. Alas, those are just movies and not a series yet. I'll keep on searching."
4,An inventive and action-filled thriller,"Alan Stowe, an elderly man of great wealth and power, hires David Goldberg, a university librarian, to act as his personal librarian, sorting and recording the papers he's collected during his life. Stowe is a conservative backer of the president (a thinly disguised George Bush) in his bid for reelection. Soon people are trying to kill Goldberg because they believe his perusal of the papers has caused him to discover the plot they've prepared to steal the election.If you put politics aside (which some of the one star reviewers clearly couldn't do), what's left is an entertaining thriller that charges along at a furious pace. The characters tend to be thin and the relationship between Goldberg and the beautiful woman who may or may not be on his side is improbable at best, but the inventive and action-filled story nonetheless entertains."
3,Great Book. Bad Ending,"The book's great. Great characters, you get involved & can't put it down! But the ending is reminicent of Caleb Carter & Patricia Cornwell.I was annoyed."
1,A waste of my time,"This was a complete waste of my time and many trees, I regret to say. Clark Kent of librarians becomes a Superman? Um, unlikely. What a hack job. I won't read this author again. Ugh"
2,"Trashy, Formulaic. Not fun....","This book had real possibilities, especially for political conspiracy afficionados. The story details the forces behind politicians, the big money movers who ensure that a corrupt system maintains itself. It is lifelike and possible.However, the story as written is too predictable, and at times inane. Librarian turned covert operative who outwits the bad guys. Give me a break! And with gratuitously raw and mean-spirited sex and domination. I suppose if trashy stories are your interest, well have at it."
2,hit or miss,Thee price was right and the lights work good but.....they have only been on my truck two months and one of them is rusting right trough the crome finish. It is past the time when I can return them so I will have to buy something else.
4,Can't complain too much for the price.,Good light but the will start rusting out quick in a wet environment. I live in A very dry environment and they are showing signs of rust where the bugs hit them when driving down he road. But still don't be fool by kc lights or other expensive brands because they all rust eventually. I would definitely buy these for the price. This is an oustanding.
5,NV-802C Utility off Road Light,The lights came in individual packaging but in 1 shipping box.They arrived early as all my Amazon orders have.I had to install them upside down.They replaced the hail damaged lights in my Dutch Star motor home.They are brighter than the original England made brand.
4,Work good but can be wiggly with vibration,"I like how the wires come out of the light inside a chrome plated metal conduit. Lights work good but if you mount them where they are subject to a lot of vibration like on a plow frame, you will see the vibration in the location where the beam is pointed. This is caused by the large rubber grommets provided for where the light bolts through whatever you're mounting it to."
3,What about the included installation hardware??,"I got the lights and they look great, but isn't it suppose to come with the installation hardware? All I recieved were the lights, nothing else."
3,Dedicated researcher!,"...unfortunately, it doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense to comment that previous research of a topic is inept and then combine that with a few tidbits of new material that according to ""you"" was overlooked. And then deduce that history may or may not have been altered. Ms. McNeal's approach seems similar to that of the ""numerous"" books written about events that took place in the sixties (ie) Kennedy, et. al. Regardless, she is to be congratulated for her approach and willingness to become involved in such a complex and never ending story!"
3,"Good research, but what's the point?",Shay McNeal has invested a lot of time researching . . . what? Did she prove there was a plot to save the Romanovs by the King of England or the Kaiser? No. It's all innuendo and speculation. I really felt I wasted my time reading this one.
1,More textbook than novel,"I was so disappointed in this book that I ended up skimming the last half (and I NEVER do that with books). I have been reading a lot about the Romanovs in the last few years, and was interested in the possibility that there might have been a rescue or at least the plans for one. This book, however, only teased with that promise. Instead it was pages of unmemorable Russian names and narrative that read more like a Congressional briefing. I actually prefer the non-fiction genre, but this book was beyond that. If you are expecting cloak and dagger or if you are expecting an elaborate plan for the rescue of of the Czar, you may be disappointed."
1,What Truth,"Aside from a very valid attack of the DNA evidence that ""proved"" the recovery of the bodies of five family members, this is a very confusing and poorly structured analysis of ""The Truth Behind the Romanov Mystery.""The author has done exhaustive research, but has not synthesized it into a believable alternative to the official fate of the Romanov family."
2,Convoluted and unbelievable,"I could only get into a few pages of this book, but from what I can tell the main premious of this book is off.Many people want to believe that Nicholas, Alexandra and their 5 children did not die such a horrible death, but more than likly they did. In 1917 not much could have been done by their family in different countries and the chances of seven people matching the genetic makeup of the royal family as well as their ages would be hard to find, even amoung inbred royal Europe."
2,Very confusing,"I found this book very hard to read. The author would give a thread of information, tell you that more would be said about it later and then you would have to remember that thread to tie it to what was said later. I found myself constantly going back to another page to try to pick up the thread again. The conclusions she reaches are also based on pretty slim circumstantial evidence. I wouldn't even call it that: it was more coincidental. I don't think this book brings anything to the mystery of what happened to the Romanovs."
1,Guess work,Good hard-work. Silly speculations. Resuing the Czar was nothing more than commercial fiction. There is no evidence it was anything more and to base an entire escape of the Romanovs on this Rudyard Kipling look-alike is nonsense.
2,Practice makes perfect!,"This opener is pretty sleek and easy to install--took me about 30 minutes (be sure to read the instructions carefully!) OK-so, the operation. Well, it's alright. My wife actually got the hang of it before I did. You don't just put the can on the unit cause it won't grab it. You put the can on, pull down the lever, then push the can back a bit (?) till it catches and starts to open and turn. After a dozen or so cans you get the hang of it and the power of this opener is great. Still, I wonder if the design couldn't be improved, though it's ok for now."
2,installation time consuming,This rating is based primarily on its installation. After I have had time to use it more my overall rating may go up 1 or 2 stars. The installer is directed to use a flexible piece of plastic as a template. This of course means you can have multiple locations for the holes in the cabinet. A template printed on a piece of paper could easily be put in place and holes marked according. The template should be sized to fit into the corner which means their would be a different template for an overhand and a flat bottom cabinet.
4,black and decker can operner,had one like this for 11 years had to go on internet to find same or almost same one to replace old one have onlt good luck with it
3,Black & Decker Can opener,"I needed a replacement under the counter electric can opener and found this one as acceptable. I only wish the old holes would have matched up with the new item. The can opener doesn't cut the smaller cans as ""cleanly"" as the old one, but it works OK."
1,Not worth the money or frustration,This is a miserable product. It takes too many tries to get it to line up perfectly just to open a can. Would rather use a manual can opener than to waste my time with this thing.
1,Black & Decker Blew It,"I purchased an under the cabinet Can Opener from B&D twelve years ago for my former apartment (my daughter lives there now) and it still works beautifully. However, over time, it has become pretty ugly and needs replacing. I purchased this model in August 2002 for my new apartment and the piece of junk broke down in two months (push down handle broke in half). Whatever happened to the B&D quality? I want to buy a new one for my daughter and replace mine also but will NEVER use B&D again!!!!"
5,Works Great After 4 Years,"I've had this for 4 years and it's a fantastic kitchen tool. It has opened every size can & I have never once pulled out the manual opener.The installation was frustrating. It may be designed for different width cabinets. We used some wood shims (thin wood strips) inside the cabinet to attach with the mounting strip and it's very secure. Maybe you could try shims underneath the cabinet if clearance is your problem.Bottom line - frustrating installation, fantastic opener"
1,I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED,I should have listened to the other reviews and bought something else. I was replacing a Black & Decker under counter opener that worked like a charm for over 15 years until it broke.This opener is selective and opens some cans but not all cans the way the other one did. It's a crap shoot every time you want to open a can.... maybe it'll open it/maybe it won't.Save your money and buy something else.
1,The old ones were better,"I also bought one of these to replace an old B&D spacemaker that was around 8 years old. My old one was nasty looking, yellowed but still worked good. I should have kept it because this new one is a piece of crud! It is very hard to put the can on and open it, takes me 3-4 tries, and the bottle opener is side to side now instead of front to back, making it very hard to open a bottle. I am VERY disappointed in it and we have been using a manual can opener instead of this one thats hanging under the counter---it will be coming down very soon."
1,black and decker spacemaker can opener,"Black & Decker Spacemaker Under-Counter Can OpenerI bought this item to replace an old one that broke. I was very disappointed. After only one can, it broke. You have to hold onto the can to open it. You have to turn the can. It is a piece of junk!"
1,Poorly engineered,"This can opener is the most frustrating appliance in my kitchen.My old Sunbean Space Saver can opener was wonderful. But after 20 years or so, it wore out.So I bought the Black and Decker. A Big Mistake.It is very very difficult to load a can, to position it in precisely the way the opener needs to have it. The opener is (by definition) mounted underneath a cabinet, and so it is hard to see the position of the can vis a vis the opener. And placement is absolutely critical with this piece of junk.I have bought one of those hand held, twist the knob openers. I do not use my B&D; can opener, and at the first opportunity I will replace it."
2,not so good,As soon as i hooked it up I could hear the motor dying on me. The 2nd unit sent seems to work.
4,Mickey Finn's T.Rex - 'Renaissance' (Angel Air),"Two of T.Rex's former band members,percussionist Mickey Finn(R.I.P.)and vocalist/drummer Paul Fenton appeared at an event to remember the 20th anniversary of Marc Bolan's death.Bolan's son,Rolan had also showed up.The bash apparently went off quite good.Finn and Fenton started rehearsing with four other musicains and 'Renaissance' had surfaced.The six piece has successfully toured the UK and Germany.This is certainly no tribute band,but a branch of T.Rex that's been brought back to life.The disc's thirteen cuts are played decently well as these were the tunes the guys played while out on the road.T.Rex essentials like ""Ride A White Swan"",""Telegram Sam"",""Solid Gold Easy Action"",""Cosmic Dancer"",""Jeepster"",""Get It On"" and the rocking ""20th Century Boy"".The lead vocalist here,Rob Benson is actually good.One sad footnote,Mickey Finn had passed on a short time after the release of this CD.A good record to remember him by."
1,Disappointed!!!,I ordered this book for my granddaughter who loves doing dot to dot pictures. Imagine my surpirse when I opened the book to find that almost all of the pictures are done with the numbers outlining the picture--just as you see on the front cover if you look carefully at it--which I did not. The numbers are right next to each other--there is no searching for the next number. It sure is not challenging! I would not recommend this book!
2,Not challenging enough,"The pictures are too obvious before the dot-to-dot is begun, which was frustrating to my son. What's the point of doing the page if you already know what the picture is?!"
5,1-100 dot to dots,"My son's and my favorite dot to dot book to date. Puzzles all go to 100 from the first page on. 64 pages keeps him occupied for several days while we are waiting for dinner at a restraunt, while he's waiting for me to cook lunch of dinner, or whenever he feels like drawing. Highly recommended."
1,Terrible,"If there was a rating lower than one star I would have used it. The 100 drawings are just plain outlines with numbered dots very close together. There is no ""surprise"" after you connect the dots.Any child who is old enough to read small numbers and count as high as they go is bored immediately. I was very, very disappointed and would strongly suggest looking elsewhere if you child likes dot-to-dot. This is not it."
3,"Too hard for my 7-year-old, about right for my 10-year-old","I bought this to give my first grader a fun way of practicing counting to 100. Every puzzle in this book went from 1 to 100. He has problems with it because on some pages the numbers are printed so small that it's difficult to read them with glasses on, and they are packed together so that it's easy to lose track if he doesn't pay attention. My 10-year-old enjoyed doing some of them but even she complains that the numbers are too close together and that her lines cross if she isn't very careful. I would not buy this again. The pictures on the cover appear much simpler than the actual puzzles inside."
4,It's OK and a good deal for the price,"It works well and the construction seems fine. Only problem is that it does not attach securely to my Hensel Integra heads. It attaches but not securely and has fallen off once (so far). Two possible solutions are to modify the JTL adapter ring with snips/file so it fits better or maybe use a Hensel adapter. I haven't yet confirmed that the Hensel adapter is the exact same size but it looks close and may be the same.Another detail. The white surface is not stretched tight so there is some waviness to the surface which shows up in reflective subjects like flatware. My only other soft box is a smaller Hensel so this waviness may be normal for a 36"" unit. I don't know for sure.Overall, for the price this is a good deal."
2,Looks Funny; Isn't Very,"S. J. Perelman, Dave Barry and Erma Bombeck write very funny prose, and it is seemingly effortless. Lisa Boyer tries as hard as she can and it is obvious. The cover blurb leads you to think the book is going to be a laugh riot, but it is not. And as you slog on it becomes an effort to continue, which I did not. There is some funny content; just not enough."
2,Not so great,"I installed this above my front door keeping in mind the 60 degree field of view and 15 foot range. First off, 60 degrees is not very much for a motion sensor. I armed it, ran a stop watch for 30 seconds and then attempted to sneak past it. I was able to sneak out my front door and across it's path to my back door without setting if off crawling across the floor. Only wen I stand up and walk like normal, will I set it off.I also agree with others on the battery cover, it is a bit flimsy and difficult to work with.On a positive note, I do love the short 4 second entry delay. I need to start looking for something more sensitive."
3,Batteries not included,"I opened the product, and read the instructions. They state that the remote comes with batteries, three button-cell type units. They were not in the remote. The alarm does not include batteries either, as stated in the instructions.I am returning the unit, untested, since it did not include parts that were supposed to be there. I may work great, or it may not. For this price, it should certainly include the batteries as stated, and really should include ALL batteries.I am rating it one star less than the current average rating, 3 stars, instead of 4, for this reason."
3,Pets set off device.,"Nice unit if you do not have cats or a dog roaming around the house. it is hard to get the alarm set in the best location. They are also easy to get around as it did not go off the first several times that we were testing them . We like the remote and the high pitched alarm. Great price. We bought two. . We are going to keep experimenting with them. Any kind of motion sets them off..we tried to use them camping, but too sensitive to any wind. They are not meant for outdoors, but it was worth a try inside a covered tent area . If successful, I will update this review later."
1,Motion Sensor is Not detecting all the time,Motion Sensor doesn't Work Proper. Some time it detects & some times it doesn't. Even if i move Hands Near Sensor It doesn't detects. Wasted my money. If it will be fitted on 9 Feet Height sensor can not detect. I have bough this product after reading the ratings but failed to give output as per specification.
3,MA-S01 is acceptable to supplement my home security system,"It is inexpensive alright but it cannot do a whole lot. What I really want is a secondary system to supplement my main system which would sound off an external siren horn. I used to use a Radio Shack system to do that, which eventually went out of order after many years of use."
4,can't open to replace batteries,i paid a lot for this alarm and i'm not going to be hampered by a tiny screw i cannot get open.also what's stopping somebody who knows you have this motion sensor/alarm from ordering one for the remote? does their remote work on my alarm?
3,Easy to get by,"The device is effective if used in a very small area. However, it really does not work in the 20ft range as listed. I put it on the top of my stairs, hoping the alarm would go off when someone started up the bottom of the stairs and it did not work. It is also easy to get around the alarm without being detected. I crept passed it several times without the alarm sounding. I did find it to be effective if you place it facing the ray to run across the step. One must actually step on the step for the alarm to go off.. The volume of the alarm is good. Tne deactivation is also good."
4,Good little alarm,"This is a good product, but not many bells or whistles. It's loud - which is good - and accurately detects motion. If nothing else, this has given us tremendous peace of mind.Drawbacks:* Only the key fob can turn the alarm on and off, and you only get one key fob. If my wife takes the key fob and I come home early, the alarm will sound for 30 seconds, and then go off again in 4 seconds for 30 seconds, etc.* The alarm sounds 4 seconds after detecting motion. This is great when someone tries to break in; it's not so great when you enter the house holding a baby. My preference would be to give you 10 seconds to disarm the alarm.All in all it's a good product, but it has room for improvement."
2,I would not buy another one,"As one other reviewer this very small litter box might be good to train a kitten with but it's not really good for adult cats. You could teach a kitten to face the right direction, not pee off the side or on the holes in the rim. My cats don't deficate in it only pee when they make it in there.I bought it as possible transition to toilet training for some of my cats. If you buy this despite my warning you can use plastic shopping bags to line the container with to make cleaning easier. Also I have 13 lb cat that was the first to use it and it is stable enough to hold him."
2,Richell Paw Trax Cat Potty,"I have two cats and they will not use this. The first week I left the seat off and put cat litter all the way to the top. All they did was kick out the cat litter and did not relieve themselves in the box. When I put the seat on, they tried to kick out litter but still would not use it. I thought it was a great concept but my cats won't use it."
1,Should be offered in a larger size,I would give this product 5 stars for design if only it were larger. I have two male cats around 14 to 15 pounds. They did not fit in this box and I wound up cleaning up the floor behind the box. Too bad because I like the design and would love it if it were larger.
2,Not sure if I'd buy again....,"I don't know, it seems that the cat always thinks its dirty and sometimes complains. The hole is so small that the cat particles sometimes mound over the base where the cat sits. I guess if I had an 1 1/2"" between me and the toilet water I'd have a problem with my particals mounding too.I probably would not buy again, unless it was for someone else...Oh, and the little complementary scooper it comes with has like 3"" gaps between the grill so unless you're picking up solid waste or just enjoy sifting through clumps of cat pee, your hands might be a quicker option."
2,Cat won't use it,"Unfortunately my cat initially only played with the sand in it and now is not interested in it anymore. I thought she would love it because she is one of the cats who does not like to touch the litter and does not cover her stuff. I wish I would know how to get her to use it. When I took the lid off, I am not sure what she did but the pee ended up all over the outside of the box."
3,Great If Your Kids Like The Show,"My son loves the Wiggles so I bought him this CD without really looking at the songs that were on it. Most all of the songs that are on this CD are from the Wiggles TV show on playhouse disney. So if your child enjoys the TV show then they are sure to enjoy this CD which features songs from all the different portions of the show, Anthony's Workshop, Music with Murray, Community Service Announcement, Where's Jeff, etc. My son however hasn't watched the show all that much and wasn't really familiar with the songs. He does like the CD but still prefers his other Wiggles CD's like Toot Toot and Yummy Yummy over it. So if your child like the show then this CD is a good buy, but if your child is not familiar with the show then they might not enjoy it as much."
5,Excellent Again,"I bought this today for my 18-month old, and she loves it. We played it twice in the car on the way home, and she was singing along on the songs she knows from the shows. The Wiggles are great fun, and bearable for adults."
4,Wonderful for learning French vocabulary!,"I am a college student taking a French classes and this is a great tool to help me study! The flash cards are very helpful and they make sure I memorize the vocabulary for my tests! I have tried a demo for the new version, but could not afford it. I only give it 4 stars because it does not have as many lists as the newer version and is a little outdated. Other than that this was a great, cheap product to improve my french drastically! The ability to make your own lists is beyond helpful!"
3,Maybe too big for clipper,"This guide comb didn't fit on myOster Fast Feed Clipper With Attachments, so I had to use the Dremmel to enlarge the fitting on the front end. Once it was on, I didn't get much hair cut, I don't think it was the product's fault, but rather that 1.5 inches is too much for clipping."
4,"Nice product, a bit flimsy",Really spruced up the look of my truck. Install was a breeze. I used the included screws for a more permanent application.Only complaint is the thickness of the stainless steel. These will dent very easily if another car door is opened in to them.
5,A shadow like a leopard,"I like 'a shadow like a leopard' because it tells you what the streets of New York are really about. Ramon Santiago is a 14 year old boy and yet keeps a knife in pocket. He is helpless without his knife. Ramon who is trys to get into Harpos gang wants to be a macho. His father who is in jail for fighting for the freedom of Puerto Rico always told him to be a man. Now Ramon wants to make him proud by being in Harpos gang. Until Harpo tells him he has to steal money from an artist Glasser. Glasser inspires Ramon to follow his dream. It was a very sad book and made me cry, because Ramon doesn't have anyone yet Glasser and him build a very good friendship."
4,Awesome low-budget movie,"I am not part of the production company, you can check my other reveiws. The story is original and the gore is awesome! This is not for the squemish! It is one of those low-budget gems that come around once in a bluee moon, so if you come across it, pick it up! And Bill Moseley (House Of 1000 Corpses, The Devils Rejects) is in it so you can't go wrong there!!"
5,Best book to carry in your lab coat while on peds,"Excellent book! It's like carrying Nelson's in your pocket, but MUCH lighter!"
5,We should feel grateful...,"that a person like Mr. Hiscano is out there documenting the last few wild places in New Jersey. He's a modern day Thoreau using the lens instead of pen and paper to capture something more than just pretty images. Instead of producing just another coffee-table paperweight, Mr. Hiscano's startling photographs display the few remaining natural treasures of this State and seem to ask the viewer what have you or what will you do to help preserve and protect these sites for future generations."
4,Tasting Heritage,I finally got a chance to sit down and overview this book. I normally do with all my books but I couldn't put this one down. The blocks of stories and memories of ancestors truly makes me appreciate Every thing I have. It also makes me feel like I am tasting my heritage as I will begin to make the food. The recipes are simple ingredients and easy to find at any grocery store. I love this book.
4,"History and Food, What a Combination!","I'm not black, I'm white, but I enjoy cooking and cuisine generated from hard times and a lack of waste. While I have other cookbooks focusing on the history of cooking by black cooks in this country, what makes this little book particularly interesting is the sprinkling of history throughout. No, it's not comprehensive and doesn't pretend to be. However, like doughnuts and coffee, the two just go well together. Some of the recipes, particularly desserts, rely too much on processed foods I wouldn't want to make. The meats and vegetables are better. Still, it's a nice little book and I'm glad to add it to my shelf."
4,A very entertaining read,"I have read the first black and white edition of this book published by Caption Box. I was originally drawn to the book because of the artwork. It has a very unique look that reminds me of both, ""The Prince of Egypt"" from DreamWorks and the 70's underground books. Even though the cast of characters is large, each one is easily indentifiable (not only by the artwork, David Lewis was able to give each one an individual ""voice"" that made the characters real individuals).This re-telling of the story of Moses is very fresh and I feel that because David Lewis was able to make every character a very real individual (with their own motivations) he was able to breathe life into a familiar story."
5,UNIQUE,Truly an exceptional and creative perspective on this age old story. The graphics and narrative provide a unique exploration. I look forward to more work from Lewis and his team.
2,Not Thrilled,"I thought this would give me some excellent ideas for card making. This book is ""ok"" at best. In order to make a lot of the cards in the book, I would be going way over and above using materials that I don't even have. It would be nice if you could see one or two pages of a book before purchasing it to make a better buying decision."
4,Good Book for Its Purpose,"Many people enjoy rides on old fashioned trains with steam locomotives. Mr. Herow's book provides information on trains in all fifty states. The book is divided by states in alphabetical order with information on the railroads, such as when they run, phone numbers and maps with the routes and major local roads. The back of the book has information on other tourist sites and places to stay. Four things I would have added. 1. Whether the railroads themselves are payable by credit card. 2. Do you need to make reservations so you don't get there and find out you can't board? 3. Photographs of each railroad would have been good. This would help people make up their minds about taking a certain scenic railway. 4. Local transit, airports, Greyhound or Amtrak terminals and their distance from the railroad should have been listed. Otherwise, for what it does, a very useful book."
3,"OK for its time, but....","....it seems dated when listened to presently. Too many of the tunes sound the same -- fast-paced reggae-ish beats -- with a few exceptions. ""Sobredosis de TV"" (""Overdose of TV"") is one. Its changes are well-paced and acoustically pleasing; ""Tratame Suavemente"" (""Treat Me Softly"") is another -- a semi-suave (no pun intended) ballad that highlights Cerati's 80s guitar abilities. Still, I prefer the Zona de Promesas remix version of the former, and the Ultimo Concierto version of the latter. Also, ""Un Misil en mi Placard""'s unplugged version is so vastly superior to this original cut that you'll be thanking Soda vigorously for redoing it. Still, it's mildly interesting to hear the first draft."
3,rating,"The product is nice but the buttons are sort of hard at times when pushed to connect, have to push buttons two or three times before doors unlocks that is why I rated it at a tthree start"
5,"WOW, have they come along way","I just picked up the cd this morning and can't get it out of my CD player. This is definetly their best cd to date and kicks some serious ASS!! Wow--Great songs, Great sound, Great band. Houseman sounds awesome on the whole thing, the boys did it this time!!!!! I think this one will broaden them into a wider audience which they deserve. Can't wait to hear this stuff live."
3,Overproduced,"I was psyched to hear that Galactic had signed on Dan ""the Automator"" to produce this album. I was sure he would help Galactic produce some single quality tracks and that we might even get to see these guys on MTV. What we got instead was an overproduced album that contains some great tunes that were destroyed by a very non-Galactic move toward a slicker sound which isn't very flattering to Galactic's brand of musicianship. The only highlights are the songs featuring the Houseman in which his vocals distract you from the slickly produced backing music."
2,Dan The Automator ruins it.,"Galactic decided to go with a big-name producer named Dan the Automator. Dan the Automator took an amazing, explosive, quirky funk sound and gutted it of any soul it had. I'm sure these songs sound good live, that is without Dan the Automator's overproduction and mixing (Drum machines over Stanton Moore? For shame! The horror!). The album itself is flat except for a few high points - ""Paint"" is good, ""The Beast"" is funky enough, ""Never Called You Crazy"" is good, and ""All Behind You Now"" is a great song, or would be live. That's about it. The rest of the album varies from so-so to outright boring, and considering the amazing amount of talent Dan the Automator had to work with in Galactic that's a crime.Crazyhorse Mongoose and Late for the Future are both far superior records."
2,Galactic Falls Flat,"This album in some ways is a perfect antithesis of the quirky, wacky, vivid personality of the first three Galactic studio albums--this is boring, flat and generic. Is that Stanton Moore or a drum machine? Precede straight to Garage a Trois."
1,Galactic Becomes Generic,"This CD was a complete bore compared to their previous releases. How long can you listen to them repeat a simple rhythm? It barely qualifies as music. Some advice to Galactic: next album better have some chord changes & melodies (aka ""music"") as well as solos, experimentation, etc., (aka ""galactic"")."
5,Ruckus is by far Galactic's best studio work as of yet,"The boys from New Orleans have defined their own funkiness, and Ruckus reiterates their unique sound. Ruckus is comparable to Coolin' Off as far as the groovy beat goes, but the music is much more mature than Coolin' Off. I've only had the CD for two days and I'd say its already one of my favorites. My choice tracks are ""Never Called You Crazy"" and ""Uptown Odyssey"" but there is not a weak song on the CD. If you haven't heard Galactic, this is a great way to start. If you have, then you aren't a complete Galactic fan if you haven't heard this gem."
5,Pure Bliss,This album is just so happy and funky. I listen to it over and over again in my car without realizing it.
2,Over Produced and Underwhelming,"Ruckus is not your typical Galactic album. Unlike other albums, which sound like they were basically recorded live (no overdubs, headphones, etc.), Ruckus is most definitely a studio album, replete with synthesizers, pitch-shifts, overdrive effects, reverse echoes, and various other audio-engineer-generated monstrosities. That said, you can still hear the Galactic sound on a few tracks -- notably, ""Paint"", ""Never Called You Crazy"", and ""Uptown Odyssey"". Sadly, other songs such as ""Kid Kenner"" and ""All Behind You Now"" have been butchered beyond repair by the producer; they are best (and charitably) described as Galactic-like substances smothered by comic-book sound effects."
4,Something different...,"for me. I'm not really familiar with 'funk' music since I mostly listen to metal and hardcore, but I discovered Galactic while looking through a different music site and decided to listen to the samples. I thought they sounded good enough so I bought the album and enjoyed it for the most part.The faster songs are better, in my opinion, and I like how the bass sounds. I just wish there were more keyboards and saxophones, because those made the songs stand out more. The album was also a little repetitive at times, like when the drummer kept repeating himself, although he did excellent fills.Pretty good and something different for me. I really like the songs Uptown Odyssey and Tenderness. Really good lyrics, too."
5,"A haunting, inspiring Classic!","This CD will go down in history as a classic! Harvey Arden reads to the book he edited that was written by US Ojibway/Lakota political prisoner Leonard Peltier called Prison Writings.Steps above eloquent poetry, it's a journey that takes the listener inside prison walls and weaves through US / Indian relations, FBI abuses, and our conscience. The music is haunting and inspiring. The story will stay with you and leave you with vignettes of wisdom and emotion.My favorite line of the CD, ""Are you an Army of One? And if not.. why not?"" I highly recommend this CD. One of my favorites."
2,not worth the funds,I was not impressed. Bought these for my son who is a chronic bedwetter. Hoped it would keep me from having to wash sheets and blankets daily. Unfortunately it just added itself to the wash list. Leaks badly even with a firm fit. I do not reccomend this product!
2,Better luck next time,"As someone else has said, I seriously wonder where the editor was on this book. Between grammatical errors which kept me wanting to reach for a pen and use of tedious cliched set ups, reading this book got tiresome very rapidly.In addition, knowing via the characters personalities what was going to happen to whom, when and why almost from the first page made it hard on the reader to stay involved in the story. I really like a little ambiguity in who is good and who is bad - after all that's life - but this did not give it to me. I kept hoping for the ""bad character"" to be killed off quickly simply to end my annoyance.This was recommended to me as someone who has also purchased A Winter's Haunting by Dan Simmons. Though, A Winter's Haunting is probably the weakest of any of his books that I have read it was still better than this."
2,Skip this one,"While the story line is interesting enough (See also John Carpenter's 1980 film THE FOG if you like this), where was Mr. Chiocchi's editor? Errors in grammar as well as the story itself became tedious. The writing style could have used some polish as well."
3,Kennedy anyone?,"I too noticed some grammatical errors in this manuscript that should not have been there. But that's not the big issue. The points of view in this story kept changing, as well as the flashbacks (too many) and just as soon as you would try to understand one angle you'd be faced with a new one and then at the end you're supposed to be able to fit it all together. The editing was just not as good as it should have been. This also makes me think of another high profile family in the U.S. that has supposedly been ""cursed"" with evil through the years. Did anyone else draw parallels to that? Jonathan had the greater strength and resolve of the two brothers, but it was amazing how submissive he was when he and brother Chris were engaged in serious conversation. To me Chris had no depth to him, just another spoon fed rich kid intent on keeping his family name intact no matter the consequences."
2,lasted only 2 months,04-267-001 worked great for 2 months then plastic nipple that fit into hose snapped off. No replacement part online and not covered by warranty (lifetime warranty).
2,Lovejoy The complete season 2,"This product was in PAL and that was not very clear from the order information online. PAL, of course, does not work on US DVD players (with the exception of laptops, etc.) Basically it is useless for home viewing. I know I have the option of returning it but it is a nuisance and I no longer have the shipping package.Sure, I should have seen the media information but I do not believe it was indicated very prominently."
5,Lovejoy / Second season,I'm sorry to say I have not viewed this because it's to be a Christmas gift for my husband. Having seen this series so many years ago I can only say it was a great series and we were unhappy when it was canceled here in the USA.Thanks for having it in stock so I was able to order it. Evelyn
1,Failed completely after only 11 months,"Loved this salt grinder when I got it in March, 2012, but now the darned thing has seized up completely. Can no longer turn the base to refill - I've even had my husband and a couple of other ""strong"" men try to turn it, to no avail. I had certainly hoped that this would not be a disposable, but apparently it has become so.Very disappointed."
2,review,The polish is ok but not KIA smell.I do not want to say seven more words about this product. Lala
4,Great travel cooler,"This is a convenient ""fold up"" cooler but would have been even better with the removable liner that is found in some California Innovation products. The dealer was prompt with acknowledging the order and in shipping."
1,Items Delivered Are Not Items Shown,"I ordered three of these lunchboxes but was disappointed when they arrived because I did not receive what I ordered. The lunchboxes in the photo show an insulated top compartment. The product description describes an insulated top compartment. I received three lunchboxes with no top compartment. The insulated top compartment was the reason that I ordered these, so they are going back."
2,cheap zipper,This cooler is such a good idea.Its light weight and the wheels are easy.It folds nicely.The biggest problem is the horribly cheap zipper.It broke with my second use.What a waste.
3,Wise Up Katy,"I really like Wise Up Katy. It's a great song - very upbeat, reminds me of my college days."
3,fresh from the uk.,"the artful dodger are one of the biggest two step djs in the uk at the moment along with m.j. cole, the architechs and truesteppers, they have been creeping into the charts with a refreshing blend of r&b, with drum and bases undertones that make you want to dance all night. if your bored of the formula of most current u.s. r&b and hip hop, then this will certainly be a refreshing change. originally designed for the clubs it has a more upbeat tempo and launched the career of craig david. i think it's great to hear this sort of music and that it is from my home country makes it even better."
3,Excellent dance cd effortlessly mixed by the dodgy ones.,Wicked set of tunes. Not the hardcore two step but very danceable .A lovely collection. Could have done without the Sisqo Track. Love to see artiste like Ritchie Dan branching out!Kader
2,What is this?,"This is going to sound ignorant but what is ""2-step garage"" music. I really like craig david and when i was downloading his songs i saw he did some collaborations with artful dodger. Who exactly is he, or is artful dodger a big group of people. I'm so confused. Help me understand."
1,Doesn't work with the T-mobile SDA,Thought I'd take a shot and try it with my SDA. Sound only comes out of one channel.
1,Headphone adaptor,"The adaptor is useless! I wanted to use it with earphones so I could hear better when using my cellphone. However, using it necessitates unplugging it each time I want to speak into the cellphone so it is completely worthless; it's a waste of money!"
2,ODESNT WORK ON BLACKBERRY PEARL,"i know, its for the samsung, bu ti read the reviews and thought that i can try it on my ""other phone"", the pearl. Doesn't work. Set me back $8...:(...."
4,Works great with LG VX8100!,"This is the 3rd adapter I've purchased, and is the only one I've found that works with a LG VX8100.No static, great sound.The cord seems a little flimsy, so you may need to be careful with it."
4,Works like it should,"Cord feels a little thin for something that will be hanging off a cell phone and getting bumped around so I'm a bit worried about how long it will last but so far it works great with my LG enV (VX9900) and standard stereo headphones which is what I wanted it for.I have to unplug it to answer the phone or to make a call but I wanted this to be able to use the MP3 player in combination with my noise canceling headphones on flights (where I'm not allowed to keep the phone in call mode for anyway) so all in all, a good solution for my particular need."
3,works for a while,"works well with my samsung a920 phone, but it isn't very durable. only last about 3 weeks before the wire went bad."
2,"Probably works fine, but not for my Blackberry","I have been having a really hard time finding a product that will allow me to use my Sony headphones on my Blackberry 8830. I saw this and I thought that maybe I finally found something that'll work.Nope.I'm sure this is a great product for other phones, but it isn't for the 8830. It only pipes out sound into one speaker. And yes, it does it even if I connect the plug to the headphones first and then plug it into the phone. Stay away from this if you have the same phone as I do."
5,Does the trick,Works perfectly on my Motorola phone with 2.5mm jack and standard 3.5mm stereo headphones attached. And for a fraction of the cost of similar branded parts.
5,Works great for all 2.5mm jack phones,"Works Great. I use it with my 3.5mm headphones to listen to mp3s on my cell phone. It also supports stereo headphones with mic, but normal headphone connection works for stereo listening."
1,Cheap no function,"I have a phone that has a 2.5 instead of a 3.5 so I figure I'd buy this so I can listen with my good headphones. It works technically If you hold them together and don't move for a good while. Otherwise any movement by yourself will force disconnection or distortion/crackling of audio. I bought this but I couldn't tell you where it is now ,not being used I know that."
3,Works but....,"A warning to LG VX8300 users: I bought this to listen to MP3's on my phone and although it worked, the volume level was so low it made the unit worthless for anything other than listening in a quiet environment. In fact, the phone's tiny speakers were louder than the headphones. I tried with two different sets of 3.5mm headphones with the same result.Today I purchased the Jabra C120s 2.5mm headset. The volume level is much louder, plus you can use them to answer a call without removing the headphones (built-in mic). The only negative comment I have about the C120s is that one ear bud cord is twice as long as the other. What's up with that? Very annoying."
5,Works with a950,"I can confirm this also works with the Samsung SCH-a950 V-Cast phone. Works fine with my 3.5mm iPod earbuds, in stereo. Volume is not overly loud, in fact, I wish it was louder."
2,Doesn't work will all 2.5mm jacks,"I've tried 2 (returned the first one) of this item on my audiovox phone and another device, and in both devices, the sound won't come through in stereo with the headphones (3.5mm) plugged clear into the adapter. It does come through in stereo if I pull the headphone one notch out of the adapter, but I don't think that's a great solution. Granted, it does say it's an adapter for a Samsung device, but I'm not sure why it wouldn't work in any 2.5mm device."
2,Does not work on Blackberry Pearl,Bought this to use regular 3.5mm headphones with my Pearl. Did not work - not sound at all. Perhaps it was not meant to work with any product other than Samsung.
2,Not for any 2.5 phone,"Doesn't work much at all with a Cingular 2125 (htc phone)If I mess around with the plug to have it in about 1/4th of the way it gives stero sound in a whisper, other then that, nothing."
3,No stereo for Treo 700w,"I bought this for my Treo 700w ($4 + free amazon prime S&H;) - great price!Looks cool; sounds great; nice packaging; a bit cheap on the pieces.Unfortunately, no stereo sound. I guess it was designed for the 700w."
2,Actually for Samsung (and others listed!),"This does not work on my Nokia 6300. Products like these are very frustrating for me. When a phone says ""2.5mm"" plug, that should mean there is only a single type of 2.5mm plug. In fact, there is not!So unless you have the Samsung SCH-A890 or a phone that a user has left positive feedback about, do not get this product! I purchased it because I thought they were universal, and this product had better reviews."
3,Works for the most part...,"I have a set of headphones in my helmet for when I go riding. I used to use an MP3 player but since it crapped out (iRiver has crappy support for corrupt firmware updates) I started to use my Chocolate V2 VX8550 with a 4 gig micro as an mp3 player. Well at first I thought the 2.5-3.5 adapters were the jam since I only tested it in my car and a couple times on the bike. When I ride I stick the phone in the inside pocket of my leathers. Well after about the 4th time out on a longer ride, I started to notice it cut out on the right. I fixed it by putting a rubber band around the jack where it connects to the phone but it's kind of stupid to be doing that. If I don't use it while riding, like in my car or in the office it works perfect."
3,Not quite right for Motorola phone,"I bought this for my Motorola phone since it seems to be of better quality than some of the other aftermarket adapters. Unfortunately, the 2.5 mm female plug (on the phone) is apparently slightly different on Samsung phones. I compared it to an actual 2.5 mm Motorola headphone plug, and the rings on the Samsung phone are slightly closer together. This I guess affects the contact quality, you sort of have the work it around a little to get stereo sound. I don't use the adapter anymore unless I have to, and preferably if the phone doesn't need to be moved or carried (like when I plug in external speakers to the phone).I suspect those of you with mono audio problems have a similar compatibility issue."
5,Does the job,"It's exactly what it needs to be--a durable case with included tubes to hold chokes. The zippered pouch doesn't have much room to allow anything other than a flat choke key, but that's about all you'd reasonably expect to put in there, anyway. I have two of these pouches (for two different shotguns) and there's not a whole lot more I'd want out of a choke set carrier."
4,"Good, But a Bit Thin","I'm happy for the most part. I saw the package and opened it when I caught the chance. Once I did, I saw that it was very nice without any crooked cuts or errors. The only thing I noticed was that it was thin, but that's what one has to expect with polyester. It looks nice on a wall, but be weary of taking it outside. The weather tears poly flags up."
5,good enough for display,My son collects Soviet Militaria and i got him this as a space filler until i can find a all cotton flag from Russia. until then this will do. the colors are bright and it is sewn well.
3,Great Looking Flag but Extremely Lightweight Materials.,"I must admit this flag looks great with vibrant colors. This is strictly an indoor flag and would look great as a decoration or wall adornment. Mine is hanging outside and will judge its durability. This flag is made of the lightest weight materials out of over a dozen flags I have purchased on Amazon. The flag is also smaller than the other 3X5' flags that hangs alongside it, which puzzles me. Overall for the price it is worth it if you can overlook its shortcomings. The seller provides excellent shipping. The flag was folded in half and tightly packaged in a small mailer. However, after it hung outside for 2 days, all wrinkles and creases have disappeared, indoors a quick ironing would be required."
4,Nice looking flag,"Price was good. Shipping was acceptable. It came neatly folded inside a larger envelope. Just iron out the folds and your good. Material is OK and Stitching is sub par. It comes with a cheap price, so you can complain but i would rather complain on price than quality. Nice buy."
4,Indoor Flag,I wasn't planning on flying this thing outside because I'm not a commie. But I bought it because I like history and it looks good next to my AK-47. It's a really thin material and you will have to iron it when it arrives. Excellent deal for the price
1,"Horrendous product, even worse service","Don't even bother with this item. Not only is the product even cheaper than you can imagine (uneven stitching, thin material, cheap, poorly shaped grommets), but the seller is atrocious. Hands down the rudest vendor i've ever come across on Amazon. The item arrived stained, and the seller went as far as accusing me of threats, simply to avoid taking responsibility. It isn't worth the money in the least, get this somewhere else, where the seller actually has some semblance of business acumen."
4,Good for a brief overview of American History,"This appealed greatly to my wife who never studied much of American History. I found it interesting as well, but was less enthusiastic since the material was very familiar to me. Still, it is presented in a unique and captivating format. It is good for both kids and adults."
4,Great book until 1950,"American history is rife with stories about Washington and a cherry tree, Jefferson and his slave mistress, and more that we all accept as fact. The author does a nice job dispelling these myths and more. I read the book all the way through and stayed entertained...... until the end of WWII. If the book had a slight leftward slant before that period, it ended with a major slant afterward. The treatment of Bill Clinton is especially biased.Overall though, I would recommend this book. Any author who can make history entertaining is doing the country a service."
4,"I hate history, but loved the book!","Growing up I hated history, more than even science and biology. As an adult, I understand the need to know what happened in the past, and usually get most of my history lessons from documentaries on television.History books always put me to sleep. This book was different. Once I started, I couldn't put the book down. I learned more about American history from this book, than I did anywhere else, and in a manner which made me want to keep going.This is the only history book which I have openly recommended to others for about a month after I finished reading it."
2,More light weight reading.,The author makes a better radio guest than a writer. I find his stuff very light weight and more suitable for captions for cartoons.
4,Don't Know Much About American History,Excellent Book....I really enjoy reading this to my students. It's very interesting and has a lot of humorous facts. Something new learned every day.....We love it! Michelle in Alabama
4,Don't know much about American History,This book was vey informative and it is in a good format for teaching kids about American History. It focuses evenly on topics that are appropriate for children to know about and topics that every child should learn sometime in their early school life. It really captures the audience that it was written for.
1,"Don't know much about American history is right, for the author","I couldn't get past the 4th page, when it said Columbus died thinking he reached the West Indies. Are they serious? Columbus died a rich man, because of his discoveries. That is a total lie. I would not let my child read this book due to the obvious ethnocentric slant."
2,The Kiddie Version,"Well this book is fine if you want the 8th grade version of US history. Of course, I myself doubt the accuracy of the book. If you look on page 141 you'll find a lovely picture of ""Stalin"" which tells you the man in the center of the photo is Stalin. I nearly died laughing because any idiot could see that the man in the bright white outfit standing in the center was not Stalin. Stalin is actually standing two men away to his right. I wonder if in fact this was done on purpose, so that a person just glancing at the image would simply view Stalin as this strong dictator that we must fear, instead of the rather weak person he looks like in the photo (not that Stalin was weak of course...)Bottom line: I don't trust the book. It's a whole lot of propaganda and bias. But if you can read it with that in mind, it works fine as a referrence to dates and whatnot."
5,O-Town Rocks!,"So does this DVD! Not only is the music great, the guys are awesome. This DVD is extremely well mastered. I am a professional video engineer, and when I popped this in my player, I was instantly impressed. I'm sure my love of O-Town may have affected that statement, but whether you've heard of them or not, this DVD is something you have to have. Also check out ""O-Town"", their self titled album. I can't wait for their next!"
5,The Best Ever!,"This is the best pop music ever produced. O-Town is comprised of the finest vocalists in modern music. Why the critics claim that this is a manufactured band for pure profit sake is beyond me. There is not a shred of evidence that this is a fake band created to dupe little girls and gay boys out of there bubble gum money.I mean, sure they can't read or write music, don't play any instruments, reqire high powered computers to filter and blend the vocals. OK, so none of the O-Town studs have any vocal range beyond the average person singing ""Happy Birthday,"" but come on the songs are so great...well, aren't they? OK, maybe not, but they are such great dancers...well, aren't they? OK, maybe not, but they are all so great looking...well, aren't they? OK, maybe not, but...they are still the greatest pop band in history so says me."
1,otown [was bad],...they screw up 9 times and cant sing live. this thing has [bad]songs with lack of music cause they talk alot during songs. dont buy trust me ... a person who knows good music.
2,Not Worth the Money,"Definitely wasn't worth the money to get this book. If you read how-to film books you will know he tried to be like Robert Rodriguez's ""Rebel Without a Crew"". Which is a far better book than this one. If you are starting out in filmmaking and would like to know something about the process I would still go with Robert Rodriguez's book. Or wait for someone to sell their copy and get this book cheaper, but don't waste your precious dollars."
3,Mediocre,"The concept of making a decent film on an ultra low budget, for instance $99, is just now becoming a valid one. The author of this book has a few valuable ideas and rehashes a lot of ideas you can find elsewhere (for example in Robert Rodriguez's book or even in one of the many videos of his ""Ten Minute Film School"" lectures on YouTube). My biggest gripe with this book is that there appears to be no way to see the movie the author says he made -- ""Full Motion Blur."" Considering that his other book is about how to do magic tricks, I think maybe this guy is primarily a writer. I also even doubt whether ""Full Motion Blur"" even exists. Anyway -- the book is so-so."
3,Odd but useful,"A very useful book on the nitty-gritty of no-budget filmmaking, with great tips on common problems that will save you time and effort to solve yourself. It is funny and informative. Definitely quirky, yet not entirely or thoroughly proofread - count on every page containing misspellings, and either of the words ""monkey"" or ""chimpanzee""."
2,okay,"This book is okay, but my main problem with is it that it does not appear the author has made a very good movie 'Full Motion Blur' on which he bases this book. This movie seemingly is the kind of stuff highschoolers (like me) make with lots of violence, no story, and poor editing.His advice is to not use a tripod, but to move the camera a lot. This, he says, adds tension to the movie. Personally, I regret not buying Robert Rodruiguez's book 'Rebel Without a Crew,' because not only is the movie El Mariachi the greatest low budget movie of all time, but the filmmaking involved with making a movie for cheap is very useful.This book is not total trash, there is a few pages towards the end which are useful, like stereotyping people and how to use them in movies, and doing special effects. Unfortunatly, for the most part, it's just stipid filler with no content about a nothing movie that no one besides the filmmaker himself has seen."
3,what do you want for ten bucks?,"Near the end there are some nifty tips for dealing with inexperienced actors. A few others are decent as well.Keep in mind that this book is about making a $99 movie - which it does tell about, yes indeed.If you want to enter a film festival or distribute it, this isn't the book. But if you want to feel cool about yourself having made a $99 movie, and can tolerate the lack of proofreading, grammar and symantical errors up the yinyang and bragging about something that is nothing, go ahead - the tips alone are probably worth it.In regards to the author's credentials, look for yourself - No IMDB listing for Full Motion Blur or Andrew Harter (as of this posting). Also, a quick google of ""full motion blur andrew harter fort lauderdale film festival"" turns up nothing that he and his buds didn't write. I could be wrong, but that's the results I got tonight.Tips OK.Book sucks.worth $10 if you understand and accept that"
2,"Palast Orchester is fabulous, these songs are not.","Thought it'd be kitschy fun to hear the absolutely sublime Max Raabe and Palast Orcheter perform pop hits like Tainted Love and Oops, I Did It Again and We Will Rock You and such. I was dead wrong. The thinness of these songs--the utter simplicity and repetition (many of these tunes repeat the same chorus a dozen times)--really underwhelms, and the impeccable musicianship of the band is lost in an abyss of mediocrity of song. This CD really exemplifies the power of good tunes. These are not good. At all. Although it's entertaining to hear Max sing SexBomb, your time would be better spent to watch the internet videos of these tunes until you are fed up with them (about 3 plays at most), and then move on to buying Live In Berlin or Live At Carnegie Hall, both of which stand up to repeated listening."
2,I like the band but hate the selections.,I was hoping to get some of the old jazz numbers they do so well but was very disappointed. They play some sort of odd kind of semi modern stuff I find hard to describe.
4,HILARIOUS!,"I put this in the player in my car, and I am sure people thought I was losing it! I was cracking up so much. I picked this up, as well as super hits 2 so I could email clips of the songs to friends. The guys accent is so hilarious and the orchestra music playing pop songs is great. Def good for someone with a sense of humor!"
1,And Where Was I?,As a gay male adult I was frankly supprised and a little pleased that someone finally explained my agenda to me! Now I know it is my eternal goal to destroy society as we know it. Here I thought I just wanted to be loved and accepted by those precious to me. How silly.
1,"WOW, this is a joke, right?","If the gays have an agenda, how come there are no books on that, yet THESE GUYS are producing and selling books about THEIR agenda????These are the same type of people who think the Earth is a few thousand years old, and Christ is coming back next month.Reasoning and actual logic will not work with them.The American Taliban!Reality eludes some people."
1,A sad confusion of Two Kingdom Theology,"As a Christian, I am deeply sadden when the leaders of our church abdicate their roles as Sheppards steering their flock to Christ, in favor or beating some sort of cultural war drum.This book is very much a ""war drum"" book with very little evidence of the joy & peace that comes with having Christ in your heart. As a Christian, you read this book and you are filled with fear and with anger. Your whole perspective is consumed with all the things that are of this world--with nary a room for anything about Christ.Simply put, if your heart is filled with fear & anger then it's not filled with the peace & love of Christ. This is normally the affect of being consumed with the Earthly realm rather then duly focusing on the Heavenly realm. In Sheldon's world, there is no room for Christ.[...]"
5,"Dibuje, maestro","Con este disco, Willy Crook y su banda demuestran que son lo mejor en su estilo en Argentina. Todas las versiones de los temas ya muy conocidos por todos nosotros son excelentes y el disco se disfruta de principio a fin.5 estrellas es poco para esta excelente y muy bien ejecutada producción."
2,Pendant OK - Cord is NOT,"The pendant itself is pretty; however, the cord has no clasp. The cord comes packaged separately with the pendant and it's just a long piece of silk string with a knot on one end. Since this is supposed to be a close fitting necklace like a choker, there's little string left to tie. Further, you'd have to tie and untie it every time you want to wear it (hassle) because it's too short to tie once and fit over your head. Since this is a gift that would be most inconvenient to the wearer, I now have to buy a separate cord with a clasp and hope that I can fit it through the hoop that holds the pendant."
5,Just what I've been looking for,This is a great set. I absolutely love the quality and perfect for preschoolers on up.
5,Good for Toddlers,Pleased with this product - correct child size arrived and good quality plus my toddler enjoys using it!
1,wrong set arrives,"I ordered this set and was sent the Oneida Chateau 3-Piece baby set which as a fork, spoon and infant feeding spoon. When I returned it and was resent another the same thing happened."
4,Pricey but worth it!,"Child sized sliverware is nearly impossible to find. I looked all over before I found this set. We love it! It's perfect for my daughter who is two. It's REAL silverware but for smaller hands. The fork actually spears food! No worries about shap edges on the knife it has no ""edge"". The spoon has worked well for us. My daughter can grasp and manipulate it with ease. My only complaint is that for $15.00 you get one fork, one knife and one spoon. Overall a quality product!"
4,3-Piece Child Silverware Set,"I bought 4 of these sets for the next generation of grandchildren in our family. My own children used them 30 years ago and those are still in use at my house when the grandchildren come. They are a great transition from baby silverware to adult size - the kids love having their own knife but there is no serration so no danger of cutting themselves, and the fork is just the right size for their mouths. I highly recommend these for the 2 to 4 year old child."
5,Perfect for 2+ year-olds,My daughter used this set and now my son uses it. We threw out the fork by mistake so I'm ordering another set -- the fork is just perfect for a toddler but my almost 6-year old still loves the fork. I'd highly recommend this!
4,Delicious sugar free treat,This brand of chai is awesome. It's super flavorful and creamy. The vanilla flavor really comes through. You can't even tell that it's sugar free.
2,I don't like this. It has no flavor.,Not sure what to say about this other than flavorless except for an overpowering sugar taste. Tastes nowhere near as good as say Dunkin Donuts vanilla chai. Have tried using different amounts and have not found any that work.
3,"Not ""bad"", but not my cup of tea...","I've been drinking the David Rio Tiger Spice Tea for years. My last order I decided to try a can of the Tortoise Green Tea. I don't care for it at all. My wife says, ""It's OK, but don't reorder""...."
3,Not as good as the Tiger flavor,"Hard to beat the Tiger (orange label) of the same brand. This green version is good, but not as good IMO. For the price of roughly 2 chai teas out on the town, I prefer to make 10 or more (best guess per 14 oz can) David Rio's at home!"
2,Not very flavorful,I didn't think this was very flavorful or spicy at all. It wasn't terrible either though. I think I would rather get real chai tea bags and just use sweetener instead of the instant mix.
1,Chai? I don't think so!,"This mix is horrible! It has some kind of artificial sweetener aftertaste, and tastes nothing like any Chai tea mix I have ever had before! I don't think I will be able to use this."
5,"Chai, baby!","A terrific chai mix. I mix it with skim milk and it is fantastic, much better than what I get at a local coffee house."
4,Delicious,Great alternative choice for diabetics. Easy to prepare and take along for work or socializing with my friends. Price was low enough for me to be willing to try it. Definitely would buy again.
3,Slight disappointment,"I love David Rio's Orca and Tiger chia, so was hopeful for the sugarfree and decaf varity. Regrettably this one is not as flavorful as the other varities."
3,a little too much fat,"I wish I had known that there was 4 grams of fat, per cup. I would not have ordered it. I appreciate that it is sugar free, but since I am obsessed with my health/weight, it was a little dissapointing...maybe it will taste really good though..."
2,Don't cut it . . .,"Ordered these knives based on their looks and product description. There were no reviews at the time. Hoped I would be the first to give a favorable review. Unfortunately, worked the other way. They arrived timely and looked and felt good to hold. As for cutting steak, they were terrible. Cut and tear and pull is the process with these. Actually, they're good looking knives and if they only cut like a steak knife should, they'd have received a 5."
4,Tiene que tener este disco,Si le gusta Spinetta tiene que tener este disco. Contiene muy buenas versiones de canciones que ya por si solas eran buenas.Tu corazon por mi es un LA cancion.
2,Too small,way to small i bought it for my boyfriend and it looks really kinda cheap. its pretty just dont order for a man
4,colorful color factory,"Jeffrey Rathbun has released a CD of rarely heard modern works for oboe which give the listener an inkling of the wide range of colors and styles available to the instrument now. Malcolm Arnold's lovely Sonatina is the most traditionally tuneful work on the disk. Other works growl and snarl in a way not often associated with the pastoral oboe.Ussachevsky is an American composer mostly known for his electronic sounds, so it is wonderful to hear the blues influenced Triskelion on this disk. Rathbun's completely effortless performances throughout but particularly on the gargantuan Koechlin Sonata make this disc a must for lovers of great oboe playing."
5,A Great Manga,"I love Inu-Yasha and this manga is great as the rest are. I especailly like this one because it starts with the second half of when Sango, my favorite character, comes in."
5,Inu-Yasha-tachi's first book (YAY!),"Konnichiwa minnasama! I really liked this book, especially because Inu-Yasha, Kagome, Shippou, Miroku, Myoga, and Sango all get together for the first time!!! The first part of the book goes through Sango, and who she is, etc. She then joins the group as the last new main character, finishing Inu-Yasha-tachi! The second part is about a ""Water God"" who orders children to be killed and generally is very bitchy (Oops, am I allowed to say that....). Inu-Yasha, being Inu-Yasha, tries to defeat the ""god"" and save the kids.... Viz hasn't come out with number 11 yet, so you can't go read an episode summary, what to do??? Noooo! Anyway, it's a really good book, one of my favorites. You should buy it. Heeheehee."
5,No Hyperbole Here!,"The average uninitiated reader will want to think that Ms Rubin's story is a bizarre exception to the US justice system.Not so! My husband is in prison for a similar non-crime, and in many ways her story is our story- except for the ending. She is in the ""free world,"" but she will never be the same or see our country in the same way.All her naked truths are bitterly so, and readers should take them as a wake-up call. Not only in the area of over-interpreted photographs but in many other areas concerning ""justice"" and the law, we live in a third world country.READ AND HEED!"
4,Good info on basic training for all,This book is helpful for both the disabled and those who are not. I believe even those who have had a service dog trained for them could benefit from the information in this book.
5,Disabled people CAN train their own dogs!,"This book is invaluable if you have a disability, and want to train your own dog in basic obedience. Stew and Lydia explain how to train a dog if you are in a wheelchair, or use crutches.Even if you have no movement of your limbs, you can train your dog, with equipment that you can get built or buy.This book is invaluable for anyone who is disabled, and wants to train their own dog."
4,Training an asistance dog yourself for physically disabled,"This is only book I could find with specifics on teaching tasks for assistance dog for people in wheelchairs. A very valuable tool!Barbara Graham, Cloverdale, CA"
5,Let's start at the beginning,TeamworkA good beginners instruction book on making your dog a trained and delightful friend to be around. Also good for review if you are using the Teamwork II book for service dog training.
1,Item delivered is not what is pictured!,I ordered this item and was sent a cheap allen key instead. I returned the allen key (kudos for making that process easy) with a letter indicating that the wrong item had been delivered. Within days I received another allen key? I sent this one back too and am currently awaiting a refund. With all the automation I don't think there is any human checking to see if the item packaged is the same one pictured on the website.
5,A must reading for all parents and teachers,"Simple Successes is about discovering what is possible. It is about believing that your child can succeed. It is focusing on the positive and working closely as a team to make your child shine. Rachelle Zola has that talent of uncovering the hidden capabilities that all children have, no matter how serious their disability is. In fact, the guidelines are good for all parents and teachers because they are rooted in understanding the person that you are trying to help. Rachelle succeeded in conveying her message in her book as she was able to do it in real life with all the children and families that she has touched throughout her years of teaching and coaching."
5,Simple Successes - really great ideas by Rachelle,"This is one great book for teachers of special needs kids as well as their parents. Rachelle makes it so simple with methods she has used. Not the usual book, as Rachelle just seems to know what is right for the kids. I am so happy that she put her ideas and methods down in writing. I know that many will benefit from this little book."
5,I Love This Book!!,"I think everyone should have to read this book (and also C.S. Lewis's)! The author helps us to understand how Satan operates. I guarantee that everyone will say ""Aha!"" and see a little (or alot) of themselves in it. Instead of writing a boring nonfiction book about sin, the author presents Christian beliefs and principles in such a way that you can easily grasp the point."
4,Incredible Overview of CT,"The DVD is marred by the interview section which is not volumed at the same level as the rest of the DVD (and by the fact that the interviews are quite dated). But, on the whole, it is a must own DVD if you like music that is different.I hope that the stuff they did not do on the warner label gets released.The shorts are actually quite incredible even with the knowledge that most of CT has a background in design (academically)."
2,Blah.,"Not nearly as good as I expected.Any of the Hanna Barbera SuperFriends versions/series are much better (story, animation, ....), even those goofy Wonder-Kids."
3,If you grew up with this,"I think that you will only be interested in these cartoons if you grew up with them as a kid.I did, and rememebr them fondly because of it, but to be honest they are not that good (The notalgia value that I have for these cartoons is the only reason I have given these cartoons 3 stars).If you are interested in DC characters in animation (good or bad) you might also be interested (Since this was the first time that most of these DC characters had never been done in animation).But if you are newer comics fan, you might want to stick with the better DC animated adaptations like the various Bruce Timm produced Batman, Superman, and Justice League animated series. Not to mention the DC direct animated features.Like I said, I remember these cartoons fondly from childhood, So I will enjoy seeing them again, otherwise I would stay away unless you are curious to have a look this bit of DC/Filmation history."
3,I would rather watch them on TV then buy them on DVD....,"These are all fairly light hearted superhero cartoons. Sure they look like they were made in the 60's, but their is a timeless quality about them. Yes, it's a good thing."
3,Did someone knowlegdeable on DC/Filmation oversee this DVD production?,"While I agree with all the reviews that this is great series of cartoons that is finally out on DVD by a major label, this is actually a product advisory to all the fans. Look carefully at the menu selection where Hawkman should be. Yes folks, that is Birdman in the menu selection! A mistake of this magnitude is totally inexcusable and makes me wonder if it was deliberate. Birdman has nothing to do with DC Comics or Filmation as he is a Hanna Barbera creation / property. I would like to hear the explanation for this colossal blunder. As much as I like these cartoons this inexcusable mistake on this disk only gets 3 stars from me."
5,Classic!,"The animation is cheesy, the stories are melodramatic, and there are lots of inconsistencies..... Still this collection is a must have for any true fan of the genre. Get it right away!"
5,the 60s JLA cartoon,If like me you grew up in the late 60/70 and you liked comic books. This DVD has all the Dc heroes cartoons that ran originally on Saturday morning Cartoon shows and later on weekday cartoon shows. Now I know you can get bootleg copies of the cartoons but don't waste your money on sub par material. This is DVD is clean crisp image and great sound. It might have been made from orginal source material
4,Fond Memories,"As a kid I remember coming home after school and watching the original Superman and Aquaman filmation series and loved them both. I decided to buy them and love them as much as I did as a young kid. I said to myself I hope they would release the older JLA/Teen Titan cartoons. Finally after months of waiting the next installment in the Filmation series has finally been released. So I purchased it and love it also.I do hope in time that the rights of The Adventures of Superboy and Kyrpto, will get settled and be eventually released on dvd. I have seen it for sale on Vhs. Batman and Robin also is another I would like to see be released if it has not been so, as I recall watching it also.I also look forward to the Summer 2011 movie release of Green Lantern, starring Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan."
5,Great! Now give me more!,"This is an incredible collection of classic saturday morning cartoons. I grew up in the 70s with the Super Friends, and it was a treat for me to find these cartoons that predate those shows. I love these even better than the Super Friends. I prefer that they're not as cheesy as the Super Friends were. Ok, there's a little cheese, but nothing compared to the Wonder Twins cheese. I found it amusing though that whoever put the DVD together apparently didn't know the difference between Hawkman and Birdman. Don't worry, the cartoons actually have Hawkman, but the DVD menu shows a picture of Birdman along with the other heroes, even though Birdman is not in any of the episodes.The only thing lacking was QUANTITY. There are 18 episode with about 2 hours of content, I'd like more. I'm not sure if more were produced or not. If so, roll them out, I'm dying for more!"
5,kudos to diamanda for metamorfosis!!!!!!,"Kudos to Diamanda for her composition of the vocal tracks on Metamorfosis. It is extremely powerful, her work.How did Zorn get her to do this? She never collaborates,let alone giving him composer credit. She must havethought he was a sweet guy. She is a tough cookie, I have heard."
3,"Short of excellent, but certainly put this rampant experimenter on the map","3 1/2Marking a noticeable evolution in this radical composer's one-of-a-kind-career, 1984's early breakthrough interpretations of the spaghetti western king proved a worthy and memorable endeavor. Through Zorn's typically cracked lens Morricone's dusty constructs are given a whole new, usually quite darkened reworking. More traditional fans of these original compositions may initially be turned off with the expansive and distorted liberties taken to resurrect these themes (as compositionally sound as much of the recording is, of course this long album comes with quite a few unsettling, anti-musical audio adventures) but any Zorn fan would be remiss not to own what would start out a long tradition of these fractured, often rewarding tributes."
3,This is the first major Zorn album,"Back in the mid-1980s, Zorn wrote new arrangements of Ennio Morricone's soundtrack music. He hired the best musicians to play the songs. Then, in 2000, he remastered the old album and filled out the disc with five more Morricone songs.The result is CD that's all over the place, ranging from beautiful to ugly, from very complex to painfully simple. ""Chi Mai,"" for example is a song you'll listen to over and over. It never gets old. But then there's ""Metamorfosi,"" in which a woman howls and screams over the sound of slowly pounding drums."
4,Arrived safely ...but took some time :O),"Well packaged, everything in order but shouldn't have taken weeks to arrive overseas... (should not that the period in question includes xmas where mail slows down to a halt)"
1,NOT what I hoped for or expected!,"I have been a fan of Ennio Morricone's music for many years. His inventive use of odd sounds, as well as his haunting melodys could easily be re-interpreted by many an artist. What we have here is NOISE masquerading as interpretattion. To be honest, I am not familiar with John Zorn or any of his work. I did not know what to expect, but to my ear most of these renditions are terrible. If you are looking for a cross section of Morricone's work their are great compilations available. This is not one of them. The one shining jem is the theme from MACHINE GUN MC CAIN utilising voice, keyboards and drums."
4,exquisite accompaniment,"I've enjoyed this disc a lot, particularly because of the accompaniment. While most selections on this disc are fairly common in the repertoire, the playing is so fresh that many times I had the impression that I'd never heard the piece before. I mean that in the best way! Even a clunky old thing like the Dragonetti sparkles anew. They don't do anything weird-- just spunky lively playing, with impeccable intonation. The bass playing is quite pleasant too. I'd give it 5 stars if more of the selections were out of the mainstream bass repertoire. How many recordings of the Dragonetti do we need after all? If you get just one, though, get THIS one!"
5,Don't Go to The CSSBB exam without this Book,"Consider this text an essential part of your Six Sigma Library. While many other authors claim to have the type of detail found in this text, Mr. Breyfogle does not dissapoint. I've made a huge investment in Six Sigma related books over the years and have been dissapointed many times. Dollar for Dollar I have found this is the most valuable desk reference for Six Sigma. If you are interested in the CSSBB exam, make sure you have this book to go with your primer!!!! (The Tables are worth it alone)"

3,A critical review,"I thought the book was written on the PHD level. Most of your business leaders are not PHD's, but rather hold BS or MBAs & don't have time for all the statistical mumbo-jumbo!Remember the KISS principle: Keep It Simple Stupid!"
5,Enterprise Wide Six Sigma using Cascading Measurements generates 6S Projects,"Not only I've read this book but I had the chance to be Master Black Belt trained by Mr. Breyfogle at Smarter Solutions.The book shares an unique Methodology of applying Lean Six Sigma company-wide. The described S4/IEE methodology helps companies to implement a statistical-based, cascading measuring system that leads to the creation of projects whenever improvements in business or operational metrics are needed.The book describes how to select and track the measures so that the Lean/Six Sigma efforts better meet the strategic needs of the business.Using this methodology the appropriate approach is applied based on the need for improvement: DFSS, LEAN or DMAIC in areas such as these: organizational strategy and vision, communications and education strategy, corporate culture and history, business economics and project prioritization, organizational and individual skills and competencies"
1,Too much salesmanship for my tastes.,"I prefer a simple presentation of information over the sales pitch and hype in this book. Every page carries a sales message for Forrest's ""method."" I buy a text to learn and become informed. Perhaps there is much good information in this book, but I just can't get past the constant sales pitch.The Pszdek book is much better in this regard."
5,"It's proven, It's authoritative, It's big and that's OK !","I simply think 5 stars every time I open this book! It addresses both six sigma organizational skills and statistical methodologies. It describes the application of statistical tools (with no BULL) to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of the process (and organization) in meeting customer needs. I teach with this book every spring semester!! Sure I have to pick and choose from chapters. Sure 30,000 foot is 'high', but it is how organizations think and then execute! Thank you, Thank you . . . John Wiley!"
4,Wide Knowledge Base and pragmatic PoV,"Their contents are wide enough to stand the questions and find the answers of customers, consultants an BB who are implementing Six Sigma solutions.It has very good description skills in order to match your doubts and clarifying examples are written to ensure a good understanding of.""Implementing Six Sixma. Smarter Solutions Using Statistical Methods"" yields you the chance to find out, fix and grow your Quality Knowledge."
3,Too High Level,Found this text to be too high level and not enough implementable strategies. Not a text I find myself referring to with any regularity.
3,A Statistics Book cloaked in Six Sigma,"This book has 42 pages about Six Sigma and 640 pages about statistical process control. As such it is a good SPC reference, but thin on Six Sigma and devoid of implementation strategy.As the author of the QI Macros SPC Software for Excel, I periodically find it useful as an SPC reference.For up-to-date insights on how to implement Six Sigma even if you're a small business with big business headaches, consider my book The Small Business Guerrilla Guide to Six Sigma."
2,A book with a wrong name,"This is not a book about six sigma, but on statistical methods. The two first chapters deal with six sigma methodology but this is all. The rest of the book is simply a summary of several statistical tools (SPC, DOE, etc.), with several example taken from other books. If you are familiar with statistical methods, this book will not help will you to implement six sigma in your company. Better forget it."
3,"Excellent content, but flawed","The author has provided a fairly comprehensive treatment of Six Sigma techniques. Additionally, he has provided a measure of motivation for using the techniques in his first two chapters. The book is excellent if used as a reference.Unfortunately, the book is marred in a few ways. Its treatment of some subjects is less than lucid. For an example, the reader should compare Breyfogel's section on 2**k factorial designs with that of Box, Hunter, and Hunter. Another annoying aspect of the book is the constant advertising that the reader must put up with. Perhaps the book's biggest flaw is that it hasn't been edited well. In fact, John Wiley and Sons has done an awful job of it. The reader will find grammatical errors on many pages.I would recommend the work as a reference for someone who already knows the bulk of the Six Sigma material. However, the reader must be prepared to wade through the incomplete sentences, grammatical mistakes, and the occasional opaque explanation."
2,Poor Six Sigma Reference Book,"At it's best, this is a reference book. Unfortunately the author doesn't do a very good of explaining each quality concept and idea completely. If you don't already know how to use the quality tools in the book, you won't find this book very useful.The author uses one-sided arguments to convince the reader to use specific quality tools that he believes in. Regrettably, the author comes across as biased and narrow minded."
5,Mortal Kombat 1 1/2,"This is an excellent game. I like how they were able to go back and create a purpose for each character and kombat zone, i.e. the Shadow Priests that guard the portals, the eyes in Goro's Lair were Oni, Sub Zero's younger brother got his scar from Kung Lao's hat. I loved throwing opponents into the trees in the Living Forest. The bonus features are also great. For the next MK spinoff, might I suggest MK: Elder Gods, starring Raiden, Shinnok, and Fujin?"
3,it's a very good game a little scratched up but very good,I have received this product on time and I have to say it is a good game little scratched up but a good game
3,MK,The game is fun but its not the same old stuff because u can tell by the front it not online like the one before (deception)but the game is how ever is different playing style because u dont use man people mainly the 2 on the cover. The game can be better or worse to differnt people.BADS1. its not online.2. Not many characters to choose from.3. Its like the others and many people like the oringal style betterGOODS1.its a brand new different style playing and to people how didnt like it before might like it now2.Many more moves and differnt stuff for the characters.Well thats about all i can say for this game.all in all i think this game is worth buying with the previous Mortal Kombats
2,A very second rate devil may cry.,"This game could have been good if they had taken more care with it and spent a few more months in development. It has almost no depth as there are no items to buy, and exp is used soley to buy small move improvements. The voice acting is awful and ruins any sense of atmosphere. The graphics are lazy and the models are blocky and not lifelike. It also takes hardly any time to complete. Co-op mode is better and more fun, so it's not all bad news.There are far better games to spend your money on."
1,Dreadful garbage with no attention to detail.,"I agree with the ""Helel"" reviewer in that this could have been much better if they had spent more time in development. The graphics are poor and the characters themselves look awful and much like shop manniquins. Voice acting is dreadful and the music such as it is is poor and unremarkable.Another failure in this tired franchise, and an attempt to make a quick buck. Don't fall for it. Get the much better Genji - dawn of the samurai instead."
4,Better than expected,"Once you get past the low budget feel, the story itself is very interesting with some surprising twists. You have to try to look past some of the acting (which is actually kind of comical), although the main characters do a good job. The first 15-20 minutes I spent laughing at some of the acting and the ""soap opera feel,"" but after that really got hooked to the story and had quite a twist of an ending! If you love supernatural movies, you gotta see it!"
5,Butter flavoring,Haven't had a chance to use it yet. We all need less fats and calories in our diets and this should help a lot. Arrived quickly.
3,It could have been better,"THis was made mixing two TV specials. So, we've got some songs appearing in both of them. (it's the 1999 tour).Also, the MIami show seems to lacka real vibe, the open venue... I don't know. Also, I don't care abouthe the Backstreet Boys the least... (yes, I'm sure they don't care about me either..)Anyway, her band is highly professional (no doubt they were chosen by Mutt Lange)and she give one hundred pecent in both performances. Also, I must say she is georgeous, simply wonderful."
3,"Not, ""In Thier Entirety""","I've already written a review of this for the DVD listing. I dont know if my review will also show up here, but you can always go to that listing and read my comments."
1,Want a quick summary of this book? Here ya go ...,"Leaving money to kids is stupid. It will make them lazy and profligate. Instead, leave your money to charities. Like the ones run by the people who write glowing endorsements of this book. Whatever you do, don't leave money to any wicked organizations that promote abortion or free thought.There. I've just saved you a couple of hours' reading time and a lot of aggravation. You're welcome. LOL"
1,???,"I tried to check the information in the book on the people I know and could not find that the information applies to their character. This sure tells that the information cannot be generalized, which puts the book in the ""not needed store"" as far as I am involved. I did not gain any knowledge from it and I cannot understand how the information was arrived at. It is not applicable to reality at all."
3,Mid Level Tutorials,"Some good tutorials, some really bad. Just like the first book its not written by designers but more by those techie guys who do beta testing :) But I got something out of it anyway."
2,Dissapointing after 3dmax3 magic :(,"I bought this book straight away after the being very happy with 3dmax 3 magic which had a mixture of great, quality projects to work through with only a few pretty poor, cheesy ones. This new version for max 4 must have been rushed out because most of the projects here are very average at best."
3,Wonderful and Wonderfully out of Date,"This book is the best introduction to the issues involving the Septuagint that I have run across. Unfortunately, it was written in the Sixties, before the wealth of information provided by the Dead Sea Scrolls began to be considered by the community of biblical scholars. And the DSS rewrite the story of the Septuagint. Unfortunately, the lack of another comprehensive introduction keep this book on the required reading list. Just don't think your understanding of the LXX is sufficient after reading this book. You will still need to delve into the writings of Emmanuel Tov and others, though they are not intended for the beginner."
2,Montage de bajo presupuesto [?],"La edición del show realmente deja mucho que desear, el resultado de mezclar las proyecciones con el directo es nefasto y si a esto le sumamos que varias de las dichosas proyecciones parecen tomadas del reproductor de windows peor aún...Los coristas no saben bailar que no bailen mejor! [espero que esto no suceda en Cubism... ].De verdad es que los PSB no lo vieron antes de ser publicado? ni siquiera el audio es realmente bueno, pasa lo que más me puede molestar con un DVD de un concierto y es que tiene poco volumen el sonido.Lo más rescatable son las nuevas versiones [lastima que no se aprecien en todo su esplendor por culpa de la calidad del audio].Pero lo que más me ha gustado son los extras [los videos de los singles de Nightlife] y los menús, que son una pasada.Una pena que la portada sea tan buena [a mi me lo parece] y el contenido no lo sea tanto..."
2,Extremely Disappointing,"Ok. I am a huge Pet Shop Boys fan. I truly believe that Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe are musical geniuses. When I saw this DVD, I jumped at the opportunity to see this live performance myself. There are few moments in this DVD worth mentioning. The live version of ""Being Boring"" and ""What Have I Done To Deserve This?"" are spectacular, but the rest is just boring. The screen is always full of cheap-looking swirls of light and boring projections, no doubt to mask the lack of movement on the stage. You can see the boredom of the crowd during ""Young Offender"", which is a fast-paced song. The crowd is standing perfectly still the entire time. Same thing with ""Vampire"". Tennant's voice is excellent as usual, but there's just not much to look at. The sound quality of the DVD is questionable as well. Pet Shop Boys, unless they can spice up their performances, should stick to the recording studio where their true strength lies."
1,Defective Dolby Digital,"O.K, I've tried 3 different DVDs on 3 different Dolby Digital 5.1 systems. None had a center channel so the main vocals were barely audible. Either this is the worst audio mix ever released, or BMG Video has released a bunch of defective DVDs."
4,The Boys still have it!!!,"What I like about this concert was that PSB chose to perform many a song on old albums that weren't released as singles. I found myself singing to old jams throughout the performance. This DVD will remind you that PSB has survived the years and developed a large body of work, just like a Madonna or a U2. While their Performance tour of a decade ago is much more elaborate and pleasurable, ""Montage"" proves that the boys can still put on a good show. This disproves the idea that ""electronic bands"" are only good in the studio."
5,Super saw for general use.,"I'm not a pro forester by any means. However, I live on 15 acres of woods so this chain saw gets a decent amount of use. I like the size/weight/power combination. It always starts fast and runs well. I think if you follow the instructions in the operator manual you will have a great chain saw that will last you a very long time. Like any chain saw it must be maintained to operate well.I have used it cutting decent sized walnut, black cherry, white pine, tulip poplar, and small stuff like dogwood. It doesn't bog down, just keeps on going."
1,"If you're expecting a lot of pictures, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!","If you're expecting a lot of picture to show you the correct ballet positions, you may want to consider a ballet video. There is ONE picture at the beginning of each chapter, with 95% of the book describing (in words) what to do. It's more of a ballet teachers manual than something you'd give your daughter or someone already in ballet. I don't mean to be overly critical, but it was a disappointment."
1,"This is a Teachers Manual, NOT something you give your kids.",This is a manual a ballet teacher might use. It's definately NOT something you give your daughter who's already in ballet. There are hardly NO pictures. It's mosting words. What good is an instructional book about ballet without pictures to show you the correct positions. Very disappointing.
5,terrific replacement for my old batterries,"These work terrific, and prevents me from having to go get a new camera. The Old Nikon D1X still takes WAY better pictures than any point and click out there, so it's worth keeping. These batteries are very affordable, and the shipping was fast. Thank you!"
2,Flimsy.,"I love the look of this bracelet! It's so cute and pretty!!! BUT the silver is very flimsy and bendable. The bracelet has crack marks where it looks like the arms will break off! It greatly saddens me to have to return it, because it really is a great looking piece."
5,Phyliss Diller will make you crack up,"The book arrived in really good time, I was pleased with it. If you have never read anything by Ms Diller you should, this is funny stuff here and a Must Read for all mommies or momommies to be."
4,Very nice accessory!,"This is a very nice boot that will keep your gun from getting all beat up. Drawbacks are it is a two person job to put it on, and with the boot on you cannot see the dial settings. But that's not a big deal for me."
3,Simple Glass Lid,"I ordered this for my 5.5 gallon tank and it is just barely to small to use. It actually falls in the tank when placed on top. If it were just a hair wider it would be fine. It's still perfectly serviceable as long as I offset the panes by having one placed more left and the other more right. I wont bother returning it but I'll get a different lid from another manufacturer next time. I've used Perfecto lids for years and they've always been perfect. This one was a surprise. It was for a standard All-Glass brand aquarium so that may have something to do with it.I'm still giving it three stars for being exactly what it clams to be, 15 5/16"" wide. I took off one star for using black plastic to connect the two panes of glass (instead if the clear plastic it has for the back piece) and another for being 1/16"" to short in width to properly cover a 5.5 gallon tank. If it turns out to be troublesome (or perfectly fine) in the long run I may change my rating."
3,Works well-enough for a thesis.,"I wrote my thesis for law school on Justice Cardozo. With this book, I was able to find lots of source material from which could cite. This collection of decisions has all of the ones for which Justice Cardozo became known, including the Oldsmobile case which effectively created modern consumer liability negligence law. Palsgraf is here as well, along with several other notable decisions and citations. The work, like Justice Cardozo's career, is thin on Supreme Court decisions, and contains no biographical information. For that, I recommend the work by Richard Posner."
3,"Peter, Paul, Mary 25th Anniversary Concert","I was eagerly looking forward to receiving this concert after seeing it on PBS. Playing it for the first time my expectations dropped. While the concert and performers were excellent, the quality of the video was very dated, and not the quality I had experienced when viewing it on PBS. If you can overlook the video quality then you will enjoy the concert. I don't mean that the viewing is extremely bad, it's just that you should expect video quality dating back to the 80's, as this has not been restored to higer quality as other TV shows have been. Would I purchase this if I had known about the quality, most likely I would have passed on purchasing this DVD."
1,Great Concert...Poor Quality DVD!!!!,"I agree with the other reviews that this is a great PPM concert. A great selection of songs are performed. The negative is the poor quality of picture and sound on this DVD. If you are going to watch this DVD on a modern TV, Plasma, LCD or LED you are going to be disappointed. The blur, out of focus and ghosting really take away from watching this great concert. This should have been remastered to HD."
5,Love It!,"Great and wonderful Peter, Paul and Mary! I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys their music! You will enjoy this over and over again... And it would be a great gift! Thanks!"
2,disappointed,"As a long time fan of PPM I was excited about this new DVD. However, the quality of the product is far below acceptable. It's almost as bad as someone in the audience taping with a camera.Very disappointed!"
4,The concert,Enjoyed the music remember hearing it when growing up. The group was great. Recently saw Peter and Paul on stage. Sang all the old memorable songs.
5,Peter Palu and Mary 25th Anniversary Concert,Wonderful concert ... all of their great songs presented in a concert format that is really enjoyable. I had the VHS of the Concert and up graded to the DVD and was glad I did.
5,Wonderful Celebration of all things PPM!,"I have seen this program on PBS many times and I never tire of it. It is quitessential PPM. Just adore ""For the First Time"". Nice to be able to have it available whenever I want to see it."
3,"Peter, Paul, and Mary 25th anniversary concert","Although the music was good and the sound quality was fair to good, the video was poor. It was not too bad when the camera wasup close but when it backed up it was grainy and blurry. I watched this show on PBS one night and I do not remember that beingthe case. I have watched the DVD a couple of times and I have enjoyed it."
5,"peter,paul & mary ann. concert","This group has been at the fore front of the peace movements for years. their voices have the most harmonic sound ever. Great isn't enough.Video was just long enough for a wonderfull evening show. I shared it with some friends who hadn't heard them for a long while, they said it was an evening they wouldn't forget. One lady was 94, she said it brought back such great memories."
5,I WAS THERE,"I grew up in the sixties and learned to play guitar playing the music of PP&M. They played Nashville at least 3 times that I recall and we were there each time. This concert was emotionally special since my wife had passed away the previous year at 31. The same friends that had accompanied us before we're there with me again. We sang along with each song even when Mary asked us not to sing ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"" because the arrangement was a little different. The trio had only gotten better thru the years. They did 2 sell-out nights and I only wish I could have been there for both. What a surprise when a shot from behind toward the audience showed me and my friends a few rows from the front singing along. Great buy for a super concert."
3,Not a travelogue!,"If you are looking for a National Geographic Special about the people, land or culture of Afghanistan...this ISN'T it. Instead, this is an interesting take on the endless war of Afghanistan, and the ultimate martyrdom of a great leader, Ahmed Shah Massou, the 'Lion of Panjshir'."
1,DONT BOTHER READING THIS!!,THIS WAS DISGUSTING AND DISGRACEFUL AND I CANT BELIVE I PAID AN ENTIRE QUARTER FOR IT!!!!!
1,This Is A Disgrace!,"This is terrible that some modern-age author thought it funny to make fun of one of literatures greatest works. Its a disgrace to all new-day authors that one dosen't have enough imagination to come up with a story and plot of their own, but instead chooses to downgrade a beloved American classic."
1,horrible business,"Horrible business to deal with. My product was ""lost in the mail"" and i had no time to procure another. Way to go people. Do business with these people at your own risk. But I wouldnt if i were you."
1,Just a Rewrite of the Help File,"Little more than a rewriting of the GDI+ help file with minimalist samples of the main functions. No discussion of why you might want to use particular functions and - despite what other reviewers have said - no serious discussion of real-life examples at all. (The closest thing to a useful program discussed is an - ugly - clone of Paint - which I would NOT consider a example to be proud of.) The pictures are all in black-and-white, which is ludicrous in a book that deals with colour graphics, even if colour versions are available for download. Don't even THINK about looking in here for techniques to use GDI+ to make Windows programming easier."
2,NOT MUCH DEPTH ON GDI+,I AGREE WITH THE READER FORM NEW YORK; READ PETZOLD'S BOOKS (EITHER VB OR C#) AND YOU WILL GET AS MUCH OR MORE ON GRAPHICS THAN THIS BOOK WILL GIVE YOU.
3,Just OK,"This book has a really promising title and table of content, but once you start going deeper you'll see just a repetition of information from .net documentation.There are many tables listing some properties or enumerations with exact wording from .net docs. In some instances author tries to explain more below, but ends up rephrasing the same thing.There are few good things about the book. Lots of code examples (too bad you have to download it and no CD with book). Some chapters include useful more detailed information, but it's hard to find it within the "".net docs copied"" content."
1,Disappointed,This book is completely worthless. You can read the .NET Documentation and get the same information. A matter a fact most of it is that same as the .NET documentation. Don't waste your money on this one especially if you have some background in graphics programming for Windows.
2,artificial examples,"It seems that the author just wrapped the official documentation of GDI+ with some literary style. While the text is easier to read than the MS doc, you won't go far with it : a lot of remarks and most samples are just useless (imagine an ""Hello World"" written for every methods through the books).The MS documentation has a very dry style, but mostly go to the point. With this book, you'll take the longer way ..."
5,Insightful .. Excellent Printing Chapter,"I was looking for a good document and technical articles on ""Printing in .NET"" and picked this book by chance after looking at ""Printing"" topic. I was amazed with the coverage of Printing Chapter of the book. Author certainly has spend quality time on this book. The Printing chapter has about 80 pages and explains every little details of printing in .NET, which you will never find in MSDN or in other books.I havn't done much with entire GDI+ (accept printing and text) but this book certainly helped me to answer my questions. I give it a go."
2,Moderate offering,"Yellow Album offers moderate satisfaction. For a better time (and lower cost), find The Reason EP which has some great tracks."
4,"Good history, slow reading","This is a very interesting and well researched look at the history of the Isma'ilis, and compliments your Middle-Eastern history shelf nicely. It is essentially a history text, though, and heavy on the names/dates/primary sources, and isn't quite so useful if you're looking for actual legends. It is also clearly biased in favor of the Isma'ilis, which is fair considering most Islamic histories are biases against them. Still, this book is a nice addition to the sect's history, but maybe not the best introduction."
5,Great Product,If you need ankle weights these are the ones to buy. You can add and subtract weight easily. The weights fit comfortably and don't move around once you have them adjusted correctly.
5,Perfect,I bought these ankle wts to use to strengthen lower quads by using them while seated and doing lower leg extensions. Very easy to securely fasten. Able to place easily 4 of these 5 lb weights on the ankle to result in a vigorous work out doing seated lower leg extensions. Perfect for my needs and much cheaper than expensive leg extension Cybex machine.
4,Good Product,Good product but pricey. Now I can do the PT for my mother. I can select the metal weight that she needs and the metal weight is better the sand packets that I do not need to worry about the packets break and the sand falling out. I gave 4 stars because the price.
4,"Good/Comfortable weights, but too big for skinny (9 in) ankles","So, while I wanted 5 lb ankle weights, these did not work out for me as that - they are 4 pound weights. With all 10 of the weights in there, they are too big to fit around my ankles, I have to remove two of the bars for them to fit. (For reference my ankles are about 8-9 inches around)However, if your ankles are 10+ inches in circumference you will find these perfect. I wore them barefoot, while doing Pilates - no need for high socks or anything like many other ankle weights require.They still get the four stars because I will be keeping them, I just will be using them as 4 lb weights, instead of 5 lbs as they were intended. I really like them otherwise, but feel like I paid for 5 lb weights that I don't get to use..."
2,Weights fall out when the units are in upside-down position,"These ankle weights have worked perfectly when used entirely in upright position. However, a lot of exercising routines call for the raising of ones legs and these weren't built for that.Specifically, the velcro is minimal and can't adequately hold the weights in the pockets when turned upside-down. It may seem unusual to have the units upside-down. I wouldn't have noticed how common it is to turn them upside-down during use if the weights didn't fall out.Mat routines are too demanding for these units because the velcro is so minimal."
3,A good investment,I bought this 2 months ago and started using this immediately to help with my knee problems. My knee condition seems to have improved although I do not credit the improvements to this product alone. I used this in conjunction with other exercises and therefore do not know to what extent this has helped me. The product is good but not exceptional. Sometimes the velcro used to enclose the weight in the pockets comes loose and the individual 1/2 lbs weights falls out. Therefore caution should be exercised when using this with children and pets around especially when one is doing the leg lift exercise to help with lower back pain. They need to do something stronger to secure the weights.
5,I love these!!,I bought these to complement my workout at home and I don't regret it at all. They're a bit pricey (but so are all comparable adjustable weights!!). They're nice and soft around the ankles and the adjustable feature is really good to intensify or lighten the workout as the case may be. I really like the versatility of it (I can incorporate it in any workout I'm doing).
2,wears out under heavy use,"i walk for 45 minutes each way to work - when i first got these, after a 1 week break-in period, they were great - comfortable - and the velcro was secure. after a few months of walking the bottoms of the weight pouches started wearing out from where they rubbed on the top of my shoes - i started covering the pouches with duct tape to protect them. finally, after a few more months, the velcro strap pulled out of the weight band - it is only tacked in with the seam stiching - so the constant tugging on the band from walking pulled the stiching out and the band came loose."
2,Great at first but short lived,Loved this product when I first received it. Super comfy and the weights can be adjusted with ease. However it has not held up . I have only owned this product for less than 3 months. During workouts the weights pop out frequently and the bottom of the weight slot has a hole worn in already. My workouts consists of changing up insanity videos and p90x videos. After each exercise throughout the videos I have to push my weights back down and revelcro. It's quit frustrating and a pain to say the least. I have had a few pop out completely and stepped on them during excerises. That is just an injury waiting to happen. I am really disappointed these did not hold up as I loved them in when I first got them. I wouldn't recommend this product.
4,They get the job done,"After being disgusted by the nasty ankle weights available at my gym for long enough, I made the decision to buy my own to bring with me. This was a great purchase as I not only bring them to the gym but I also take them with me when I travel so I can do both leg and arm work. I love that they are not filled with sand but rather with removable metal weights. Yeah, sometimes the velcro that holds the bars in comes un-done, but I've not ever have the weight fall out, so this isn't an issue. The band is nice and long so you can get them tight on either your ankles or your wrists. The price seemed reasonable compared to others that I checked out. I'm pleased with my purchase and have had other people in the gym ask me about where I got them, and I did recommend that they too purchase these from Amazon to avoid the creeping crud from those funky ones at the gym."
3,Great value. Good quality. My daughter loves it!,"My 4 year old daughter loves this bike. I can't say it's the bike with the best quality on the market, but absolutely the best value you could find. It took my husband 5 minutes to assemble. Super cool and fun design."
1,Poor lamp,"I purchased an expensive Finelite desk lamp in July 2010, and was initially happy with the product. The lamp is an LED and quite bright; in addition, it has an easily adjustable neck. However, the lamp started to wobble on the base about the first of September, 2010, less than two months after purchase, and broke off completely October 6, 2010, less than three months after purchase. The metal rod holding the lamp simply broke off from the base and it is not repairable. This is an outrageously poor life span for such an expensive product. Amazon should not sell poor quality items like this. Signed, a very unhappy customer."
2,"elegant, but very poor value","Elegantly designed, but very poor value for money - another case to prove the LED lights are still far from popular use."
2,watch the earlier seasons,"First season of this show is HILARIOUS. Second season, pretty good. By the time we get to the fifth season, there's an extra woman who adds nothing to the show, and Dangle doing something very odd with his voice. I do not recommend this season. (As of me writing this, all seasons are available free on netflix, might want to try watching before buying.)"
1,Bad O2 Sensors,"I have done business with Auto Parts 123 on various occasions. I always ordered the same item, oxygen sensors for my car. 3 times the check engine light came on and the code read O2 sensor. I have ordered now 3 from Auto Parts 123 and my check engine light has come on again saying I need to replace the oxygen sensors I just replaced in February. There must be something defective with these sensors! My mechanic says he puts them in all the time and they last for years, mine have lasted only two or three months."
2,"Well I tried, but I tired...","Honestly, I didn't finish the book so maybe I shouldn't be writing a review. This was the first book by Lethem that I tried reading; judging from other reviews, maybe that was a mistake. Anyway, I stopped reading after 150 pages, although I tried and tried again. (And apparently that was the better part of the book!) Maybe one day I'll attempt it again.But after 150 pages, nothing happens (I kept thinking of one of the Batman movies that I couldn't watch [well, it was actually all of the Batman movies that I couldn't watch], but this one was filmed so darkly that I couldn't see what was happening); there was so much description that overwhelmed any plot, I kept mixing up the characters and finally just didn't care.Paul"
1,Huh?,"What am I missing here with all these splendid reviews? You want to read Lethem at his best - ""Motherless Brooklyn"" is the way to go. Fortress of Solitude was simply painful. Character development left lots to be desired - I never did identify or feel for these people. The level of descriptive detail was downright maddening. A disjointed, slow, uninteresting read to say the least."
1,Sadly Dissapointed,"Loved Motherless Brooklyn and was excited by all the reviews this book was getting AND I loved the excerpt published in the NYorker, but sadly this was a big letdown.Lethem's chops have improved and his visual descriptions are often stunning, but there's little else there, not much of a story, nor a novel look at the complexity of gentrification.Why did this get such props from the critics?"
4,Dirty Boulevard,"Paul Auster meet Spike Lee. Crumb meet The Lord Of The Ring. The Supremes meet Eno.Dylan meet Gus.You may pass safely by the stoops and avoid the yokes. You may look up the sky and Marvel at Aeroman. Your story may end up under of over Dose's.But you never grow up. You either become an eternal adolescent detainee (do not pass go to the college - collect $200 other ways) or the shadow of an adult pretending to be amphibian but unable to breathe far away from Brooklin.Jonathan Lethem's walk on the wild side of the pavement echoes Lou Reed's NYC : ""at the count of three - I hope I can disappear - and fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard""."
3,"A Pretty Good Book, A Great Writer","Almost four stars. I felt like i was reading two different books at times. I enjoyed reading about this kid growing up in Brooklyn with his dad, his friends, school, survival, drugs, stickball...and then all of a sudden it takes a very strage turn. Now he's got this ring...the story now requires the reader to strecth the bounderies of what is believable. It came as a complete surprise, but still i was ready to keep going. The second half of the book seems to lose its focus. Why wouldn't a kid with a magic ring use it more often? I was bored to tears reading about the Prisonaires. And i was bored reading about his father's artwork, and his trip to California. The ending was lame. i can't see it going down like that. But still it was worth the price of admission."
4,"Valiant, first Half","I consider Mr. Lethem the standard bearer for insightful, historic novels. I just wanted to say that the first part of this book made me relive the time of my childhood and the anxieties I went through. The characters are like those I grew up with and the problems they are challenged with ring true. I believe the first part of the Novel up to and including 'Liner Notes' is the finest writing I have read in many years. There was like a song beat within the dialogue that drove you forward. I can't describe it any better.Having said all that, after 'Liner Notes', the beat went away and I felt like I did not have the same urgency. I do think the pace change was intended to indicate the changing nature and ambiguity of Dylan's memories of his past but it became a chore to read the rest.Mr. Lethem, I really liked the book but I felt like you were trying to answer all the questions about Dylan and his past when your readers would have been served by their own conclusions."
2,Disappointing,"This book has some great descriptions of childhood terror and social anxiety -- descriptions that took me back to my own nerd fear. But while I loved ""Motherless Brooklyn,"" this book left me disappointed. I found the supernatural elements absurd, and often felt like Lethem himself doubted them. There is little delving into the real feelings and motivations of the characters. Perhaps most disappointing, I felt the book had no moral core. The main character is a grasping, pretentious, wimp, and through his eyes, doping, theft, murder, and vandalism seem merely to be useful street cred markers. While some of this could be explained by the bereft culture the main character inhabited, the episode at Camden College sealed my disgust. (Not the dope dealing - although I found it unfortunate that drug dealing is seen as the height of cool in the book -- but the unrepentant disdain and contempt in which the main character held the ""little people."")"
3,A little disappointing,"Motherless Brooklyn was great, so I had very high expectations for Fortress of Solitude. I was a little disappointed.The story seems to end about 2/3 of the way through the book, and I wish it would have ended there. Jonathan Lethem is brilliant, but he can also be exhausting... especially when discussing music.The story begins with elaborate descriptions of fun and games, but all fun and games it is NOT. Unlike the more lighthearted Motherless Brooklyn, Fortress's characters and the situations in which they find themselves are sometimes disturbing and may leave a lasting impression. Of course, that is a testament to the novelist's skill. But just keep in mind- this is not a beach read."
3,"promising, but inconsistant","I want to like this book, I truly do. There are moments so real, sometimes gleefull and sometimes heartbreaking, that it's such a disappointment when ingredients of pure make believe are winded into the same story. I won't go into detail on this to avoid ruining the story, but suffice it to say that what turns out to be a large part of this otherwise truthful and emotionally gripping story of two friends makes a mockery of the whole story. The writing style also shifts throughout the book, and there are some parts (Liner Notes) which are dragged on entirely too long to allow the story to flow. All in all I think it was worth the read for a few moments which nearly brought a tear to my eye, but it won't be on my ""must read"" recommendations to others."
4,Worth reading,"I'm a sucker for coming-of-age novels written by people about my age. Jonathan Lethem is from Brooklyn and I'm from Queens, so my fondness for this book is perhaps axiomatic. The first half of the book is a coming of age story; the second, more of a quest: to find the lost best friend and the lost mother.I found the first half stronger, but maybe I simply related to it more. Throughout, there is terrific writing.The superhero subplot felt extraneous; I kept wanting more to come of it.Still, very much worth reading."
2,Tedious,"I looked forward to reading this novel as all the reviews extolled its great portrayal of life in the 70's. Unfortunately, I couldn't continue reading even though I struggled to be captivated. Yes, Lethem is a master of minutae but this gets into the way of the narrative thrust of the novel. I quit reading at page 83 as I really didn't care at all what happened to any of them - sometimes one can't see the ""forest for the trees"". There are so many novels out there to be read and so little time. I regret ordering the book."
3,In desperate need of an editor,"An update to ""Call it Sleep,"" the author's pretentious style and off-putting verbiage dim enjoyment. Only 1 in 3 of his attempts at literary grandeur prove successful."
1,What happened to editing?,"This book is everything in the kitchen sink and more. It lacks narrative structure, fluidity, restraint, cohesion. It seems Lethem found himself drowning in material and lost focus. The second half of the book falls completely to pieces. The choices the author made verge on the ludicrous. Critics may call it post-modern, but post-modern is not synonymous with messy. Sure Lethem mixes genres, but is that really a virtue? Only if the result stands on its own as something unique and compelling, and this does not. The book does hold together and does not deserve the praise its been getting. The excerpt in the New Yorker was the best part. Read that and save yourself the expense of buying the book."
3,Problems in the Third Act,"I was really loving this book and recommending it to people through the first half of the book. But when the point of view changed to first person halfway through I lost interest. I finished it though. This book could have been a lot shorter, although thats easy for me to say, I didn't have to wrap it up.I agree that there were really no likable characters left at the the end, which was too bad because the first half really had me pulling for these guys and thinking about them between readings.I think the writing is fantastic and the author is very talented. Friends have recommended Motherless Brooklyn as a superior book to this and I will seek that out and read it. I am glad I read it but almost didn't finish it just out of spite, I was so disappointed with it near the end. Like the guy at the movie pitch says, there are some problems with the Third Act.Amen."
5,Rewards close attention,"This is not an easy book. In the beginning, the narrator is a small, frightened boy and his impressions are at once blurry and overwhelming, the way the world does come at you when you are little. That is what makes this book so good, the voice is perfect. At the same time, it provides a close observation of a gritty reality and some insightful social comment. The relationship between Mingus and Dylan and what happens to Mingus is a scathing criticism of how we raise and educate our children, and the terrible limitations we place on them. Dylan's belated coming into his own is earned every step of the way. I would like to see this book replace ""Catcher in the Rye,"" which is getting a little dated, as the must read coming of age book for high school students."
5,stellar -- the Great American Novel,"THE FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE is nothing less than stellar. I can't encapsulate my joy and awe for this book in a short review. Lethem weaves gorgeous, unique prose around funny, poignant, perceptive subject matter. I couldn't get enough of this amazing epic; this is truly one of the great American novels."
4,SLOW BUT IN A GOOD WAY,"It took me a little while to get into this one and having not read Lethem's work before, I found the early chapters plodding, but before I lost all interest, he would grab me again. I'm happy to say I stuck with it and was rewarded for it. Parallels to ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay"" are inevitable, but this is a very different story, etched in the grit of Brooklyn sidewalks like a game of Skully. I fell hard for Dylan and Mingus and as I saw through them my childhood fantasy of becoming magically super-powered, I went from plodding through to taking my time, as I had done with Chabon's counterpart. A great double-feature if they ever turn these into movies."
2,I was underwhelmed,"I gave this book the old post-graduate-school try, and while aspects of it were interesting, I just didn't find it the story enough compelling enough to make me want to fight through the author's arcane language. If the story and characters are compelling enough, then I will put in the effort to fight through convoluted sentences. I will read VS Naipaul, for instance, because I have found his thoughts to be insightful, and his characters interesting.Lethem's description of Brooklyn was interesting, but it was so elaborate as to be almost a little overdone. [...]The only difference is, that I found the childrens book compelling and interesting for my children. It also accomplished what it intended to accomplish and didn't drone on for 500 pages.I know that Fortress of Solitude got great reviews, but I found it mostly annoying. That's my review."
4,The soul of geeks,"I'll admit I was drawn to this novel by the comic book references. I'd heard of Lethem but never heard enough that made me want to read him. Then the title caught my eye, and I discovered that among much else he writes about the power of the Marvel Comics of the late 1960s and early 1970s, the same comics that were so crucial to me in my own moment of adolescent angst. That pulled me into the novel, and then I was gone on this dense, fascinating journey through the tortured but often joyous souls of these lonely, confused boys who take such solace in music, comics and other pop entertainment. I've never seen the inner workings of ""us geeks"" portrayed so honestly but lovingly. This sent me immediately to ""Men and Cartoons,"" also very good, and I'm now I'm entering ""Motherless Brooklyn."""
2,desperately in need of an editor!,"Like too many other recent novels, this one seems to have been published without input from an editor. Pop music, drugs, race relations, comic books, 1970s nostalgia, and deep deep Generation Xer navel gazing can be interesting to read about and they can certainly help with marketing. However, littering a ""story"" with hip topics is not enough. Some genuinely meaningful literary quality-control should go on before a work is published. Criticisms of this book's writing have already been made by earlier Amazon.com reviewers They are right on and I'm not going to waste time repeating them in order to illustrate my point. Rather I will simply bemoan the fact that, once again, an editor at a big publishing corporation failed to do his/her job."
1,Ramblings of art student with nothing to say.,"I don't know how to describe this book. You can't really due to the fact there is no content. Just ramblings of someone trying to sound observant; an example:""The long tilted slabs or the one sticking-up moonlike shape or the patch of concrete or the shattered pothole that always filled with water.""That decription reminded me of the conversations I used to have in highschool when I was high on pot.It is just a sidewalk. Who cares?And the story which is billed as ""coming of age"" reads like a story of people who never grew up. I don't understand how this book even got published. It is that bad. I felt ashamed for even checking it out from the library. I read another review that commented on the obvious lack of editing. I don't know how you could edit this work. Its not worthy of anyone's time or talent.One star is too much....."
4,Language Lover,"This book is worth reading just to experience Lethem's playfulness and love of language. The way he describes things and strings sentences together is amazing. On the down side,I thought the story was so-so and found 'Motherless Brooklyn' to be better in that regard."
3,"Flawed but, in One Way at Least, Inventive","The oddly blessed Mingus Rude, aka ""Aeroman,"" is the not the central character of Lenthem's novel, but he may be its most interesting element. Like the ring that gives Mingus flight, he is the magical streak in the otherwise painfully realistic coming of age of Dylan Edbus in 70's and 80's Brooklyn. Mingus' life story, like his father's before him, is superficially about every chance wasted. However, Mingus' peculiar innocence, his ""unhesitation,"" illuminates the muted failure of his friend Dylan to take any serious chance or to stand up for himself. Dylan can only wield the ring if no one is watching, his flights barely distinguishable from good jumping. Lenthem pulls off a coup by making readers love Mingus despite his relentless dissolution and disintegration. When Dylan decides to rescue Mingus from prison--I won't reveal how--it makes perfect sense. We feel for Dylan, but Mingus, Dylan knows and we know, was always the special one."
3,"Impressive, But Not Enjoyable","I'm an image maker by profession and am impressed by Mr. Lethem's almost photographically sensitive observations about the physical and cultural artifacts of this location and population. The writing fails to engage over the long haul. It entertains moment by moment with descriptions that are incredibly lucid and easily seen in the mind's eye. However, the story lags and doesn't seem to move anywhere. It's too slow and seems to be trapped in the moment.It reminds me of two gallery photo shows I saw recently. One was by a photographer who is known for powerful single images and the other by a photojournalist who makes stunning single images strung together to generate emotional current.Mr. Lethem delivers the former. I miss the latter in this writing.Too bad. The writing talent is there. Unfortunately in this case it seems to dwell to a point of boredom.Still, the descriptive text, rich with amazing imagery, is almost worth the hair-hurting reading.---Gary Gladstone"
1,Wasn't worth the effort to finish the book.,"I ended up finishing all 509 pages of what turned out to be a heavy, meandering book with a writing style that was so ponderous, it caused me to skim through many pages. The only reason I finished the book is because we're discussing it in my book club so it was more or less an obligation on my part.The descriptions are heavy and tortured and the plot is pretty thin. The book is like Abraham's painting on film (Dylan's father, Abraham, is a reclusive artist who seems to devote his life to an obscure artform). It's meant to create an impression - not really tell a story.Nothing really ties the book together and it leaves the reader with too many unanswered questions.Not worth the read."
5,Great for traveling,I took this pillow on a 3 week trip around India and slept like a baby everywhere. Indian beds are hard but their pillows are super large and unyeilding. Note: I took a little of the buckwheat husks out of the pillow to make it a little more flexible. Now I am using the same pillow on my own bed. I probably won't ever use any other pillow for my head.
4,travel size means small,"quality product. the size means exactly what it says. travel/child size. too small 4 me. i had to invest in japanese size/small. (one size larger) japanese size is perfect 4 me. consider size carefully before purchase in order to avoid costly & nuisance returns. good company, quality product."
3,Underfilled (not as advertised),"This pillow arrived dramatically under-filled (not as advertised--overfilled, I don't think so) which does not work well as a side pillow. I will be contacting the company for more filling. As it is right now, its worthless to me."
1,Lasted all of 3 minutes,"We had high hopes for this pillow for our 2 year old. Unfortunately, the pillow ripped apart almost immediately after we opened the package. Buckwheat everywhere -- not a good choice for small children."
4,gorgeous gershwin,this is a high quality recording of gershwin's orchestral pieces played in intriguing and outstanding piano duet by the paratores. their concerto in f is as good as it gets. a highly recommended cd for any fan of gershwin or the piano.
1,Confused,"One line means positive, two lines means negative, well what does a giant red blob mean? Needless to say these tests are hard to read and are pretty much ineffective, I guess you get what you pay for....."
2,"40% of the time, it works every time.","So out of 5 strips only 2 really worked. The other 3 were ""blobs"" instead of lines like someone else mentioned here. So hopefully you get ones that actually show lines and not blobs.One big complaint I have is that I am not sure what the cut-off for this product is for detection. They say it is 99+% effective but they don't say what the detection level is.So is that really saying that 40% of the time it works, every time? I would look into something else where you can be more confident of the results and detection levels."
1,"""best"" book on fundraising","This book was a gift for my daughter in law, a fundraiser for a huge national organization. She stated it was the BEST book she has ever read on the subject. I might add, she ia a very successfull fundraiser."
1,In order to pass,"I passed the exam, but only because I've been in the field for a while and knew quite a bit of this already. This book really didn't help very much. The actual exam questions were totally unrelated to this book. It is good for someone wishing to learn Linux from step one, but this book is far out of touch with the exam."
1,"Confusing, Error Prone, & Poorly Written","Stay away from this book! It has a million errors in it. It frequently makes reference to concepts as if you already know them, even though they are either never explained or explained at a later point in the book. Some of the sections seem to have been written by someone who can't even speak English. I was so worried I wouldn't pass the Linux+ test with this heap of trash that I went out and bought another book. This book is frustrating as heck!Overall: Useful as fuel for a fire, if that."
2,Be careful...,"This book, like many of the ""certification self-help"" books out there now is fairly accurate most of the time, but is full of minor flaws and inconsistencies. I guess Mr. Kay couldn't find an editor that was willing or able to proof from cover-to-cover, so many of the mistakes were left intact. This makes the book confusing in some places and just plain wrong in other places. The test engine that accompanies the book suffers from the same inacuracies and poor editing. This is certainly not the quality of book I expect for this price."
4,"broad, but none too deep","Trevor Kay's work with the Server+ Bible was a primary reason for my reading through the Linux+ Bible though the book fell short of my expectations. Numerous syntax errors abound and you must be careful when going through the examples in the book. However, this book continues his easy-going writing style which made the reading seem very quick.Having taken the exam recently (and passing!), you really do need a solid understanding with the command line (switches, switches, switches!), system administration/management and troubleshooting along with hardware fundamentals. For the most part, this book starts it all off for you, but you will likely need other resources to finish off the Linux+.Do not be lulled, the end of chapter questions, practice test and CD-ROM have way too many easy questions which are not indicative of the Linux+ exam."
1,Quite disappointing,The Linux+ exam isn't easy ANYMORE. I took version 2 and there was NO WAY that this book could get you past the exam. There are lots of errors and some important content is not even discussed. I read a lot more than this book before I passed the exam. I even took a Linux+ 5-day 40 hour class. I suggest you download as many of the free Linux+ and LPI practice exams that you can find on the Internet before attempting the exam.
2,Overpriced and misleading,"The book contains simple doodlings by a med student not systematic visual learning tool as the fancy book cover may lead you to think. Most of the drawings are random and too simple to be a memory aid for more Board-relevant and necessary information. And despite the title, ""Visual Mnemonics for Microbiology and Immunology,"" there are only two mnemonic drawings for the entire immunology section. Only two!Good effort but not worth the price."
1,bogus,"I wasn't impressed. Something's amiss when you see two bogus, fabricated ""5 star"" ratings that sound about the same immediately after the book is published. I'd bet my stethoscope that the author posted those. Buyer beware."
3,Excellent choice,I just finished Step 1 and I can honestly say that these drawings were a life saver. I could answer 90% of the questions from quick recall from these drawings. I would recommend them to anyone.
1,Can't change fuse !!!,"Product worked for 1 Jump Start. In owners manual (if you want to call it that), it states main fuse may need to be replaced. It says to change fuse in front of product. Can't find where this is for the life of me. Can't find help. The product is from China. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY ."
3,Looking in a Mirror,"Since critical ancient history is missing, one suspects theauthor is basing his assumptions on his own feelings and beliefs."
4,An author to be missed,"A well balanced review of science in modern society, providing deep philosophical insights and information, and addressing the delicate matter of all religious (unsustainable) support; that is, exhibiting the irrational attitude behind religion, as well as the need of believers to impose it on others."
4,Great Collection,"This is an excelltn DVD. I'm not the biggest A*Teens fan but when i saw this I bought it right there. It;'s agreat piece of A*Teens merchandise. It contains the videos from the 1st 2 albums with:Mamma MiaGimme Gimme GimmeSuper TrouperDancing QueenUpside DownHalfway Around The WorldSugar rushts all great. And the bonus tracks are the best part. ""Give it up"" is b far one of my favorite a*teens songs. Can't Stop The Pop is everything I look for in a pop song and is verycatchy. Didn't like ""Don't even know your name"" very much, but oh well. Te interviews with the band are great. The only thing tat would make the dvd better would be if they had a FULL and complete discography. Theyhave one on there but it's not all the singles. and if they had more b-sides."
3,Frame skip errors,"In 6 out of 7 vids, there were frame jumps and skips in certain parts of every vid. I made sure it wasn't my hardware or dvd that was bad, so i asked a friend who also bought it, and it contained the exact same errors at the exact same time in the videos."
3,They are okay,"but they don't have the actual size stamped on them. Instead they have the words, smidgen, pinch and dash. That's cute and all, but I did buy these to use for precise measurements of small quantity of medicine powder I must give my dog twice a day. I need accuracy and to not have to remember which word represents which size. I will use a sharpie to mark the measurements on them, but not sure how long the ink will last."
1,Worst Graphic Book Ever Written,"Programmers purchase a book such as this one to learn a topic and examine the code to get an intuitive understanding. The code is worthless, and the explanations are even poorer. Every attempt to ask the author to put out a cleaned up version is met with resentment and finger pointing. Get the OpenGL books if you want to understand 3D programming."
1,The code does not compile,"""3D Graphics Programming in Windows"" just sucks. the code does not compile in any compiler! Also i must mention the all the 3d algorithems are old, and useless. I dont recommend anyone to buy this book."
3,"Good, but not what I expected","I have dead sea salt scrub I use at home (FL) and while I was in WA I wanted a supply also. I ordered this thinking it would be like or nearly like what I use at home. It isn't. This is okay for my time here in WA but I will keep looking for the other. This is thin and watery. What I was hoping to find is a lot more solid.Good product, just not what I'm used to."
1,A great costume if you like to get punched.,"Seriously? I saw a kid wearing one of these and it was all I could do to not punch him. You put your kid in a puffy suit - with a fan - and he can't even put his arms down or run to save himself - and you send him out into the street? You are signing his death warrant. If you wear one of these as an adult then expect to get punched by everyone at the party - male and female - all night. This suit just screams ""Hit me. Hard."" You may doubt me. Perhaps you feel that you are more evolved than I? Who could possibly want to punch someone in an inflatable suit? You will see."
1,Completely Disatisfied,"The reel broke on my first use. I put my ID card on it, pulled it out to make sure it worked, and then it wouldn't retract. It eventually retracted, but then it wouldn't reel out again. Completely useless and a huge waste of time and money."
3,Didn't Work as Key Reel,"I purchased 5 reels for my cleaning team who have key rings. After one week, one reel got knotted inside. I took apart to repair but not worth the time. Maybe this is fine as a badge reel but not as a key reel."
2,Don't buy - not durable,"You might expect that based on looking at this product, it should last at least a year with normal use. Not the case. I had a package of 6 of these things and they all wore out after 2-3 months of use. The only positive is that it worked fine right up until it didn't. If you do buy, buy in bulk cause otherwise you'll be right back here in 3 months."
3,"Solid case, undependable reel","The case for this badge reel is rock solid. I'll bet you could drive a car over it and it would still be intact. But after only 4 months of use, the reel inside constantly gets ""stuck"" and it's getting worse each day. I had hoped this would last at least a year, but it doesn't look like it will. I might try taking the case apart to see if there's a way to fix it before buying another."
5,Good quaity and durable,"These belt holders are of great quality at a good price. It worked out cheaper to buy from here than what we would have paid to our local retailer, despite the fact that he was giving us ""wholesale"" prices. Nice sturdy construction and the string seems like it will last."
2,Clip is too big and does not fit on belt,The reel itself works great. It is a little larger than I though it would be. Also the clip on the back of the reel is too tight to allow it to fit over my belt without damaging the belt. It was super cheep so I gave it to my nephew as a toy and ordered a smaller clip that fits my belt.
4,pretty good,"i guess i didn't realize that this device doesn't have the kind of clip you can open and close (like on ID badges), instead it has that tight metal clip (shown in image) which i find hard to put on my uniform or belt. besides that the length of the reel is good, and the black circle face is perfect to personalize!"
3,Sticky Reel,"I am pleased with the design and heavy duty material but the reel feels very ""sticky"" as it gets stuck while retracting the cord. I've owned a few ID holders like this one which are made of plastic and at much cheaper price, but they all worked better than this one. Unless your main concern is the looks, I would not recommend this item."
5,Much better than the plastic ones,"I've been using this for about 2 1/2 years and the plastic ones would break every 6 months or so. The black paint has worn off just a little, but the reel is still going strong."
4,broke after 10 months of use,+The belt clip is pretty stable and won't fall off.-The cord broke after 10 months-The circular reel is a little too bulky
1,Didnt last a month.,"I have only had this item for about a month and the spring is getting jammed on the return. I understand the product has very good reveiws and in all probablity I received a lemon. I wrote the company a polite inquiry and explained my problem. I would expect on such a inexpensive item they would just replace it but instead they replied""Good Morning, the cost of returning the item would not be economical. You would be better advised to purchase either the wire cable reel or the chain-link reel. We sell literally over 10 000 of the reel you have per month, without any issue""If they are selling 10,000 a month then helping one customer with a bad product shouldn't be a big deal.Oh well...."
2,Snap is too weak.,"I bought 3 of these since I tend to go through badge reels quickly. The reel is fine, but the snap is too loose. My ID has fallen off repeatedly on all three units when the badge became unsnapped. It seems I sacrificed a good snap for a good reel.Having spent $25 to replace my ID card, this was a very expensive mistake for me."
4,Heavy duty,I picked this because other clips I had would break because they were plastic and flimsy. This is a very solid product. My only problem was the elastic mechanism got jammed one day and wouldn't reel back in so I had to open it up and reset the mechanism.
3,Doesn't hold up,"Product seems to have kept the wasps away, but it didn't hold up for a whole season. Totally disintegrated after a few months. We had hung it on the north side of the house so it didn't get hard sun, but it did get banged around in the wind."
1,I put these up all around our porch...,"and didn't notice a change in the wasp behavior around the porch. I'm thinking this is designed for a different kind of wasp than I'm dealing with here. They are still swarming all over my porch. This product gets a 1 star rating because I am not satisfied. If I had bought this product from a store, I would have returned it."
4,Magic,"It works, it really works. We were plagued with wasps after our humming bird feeders. We followed the directions-re positioned them after a couple weeks. Amazing. Great product. We really didn't expect it to work-but it did."
3,Pretty good Product,"It doesn't keep ALL the wasps away but we could tell a difference in the amount of wasps we had this past summer. There were definitely less in and around and under our deck, however, I did see a wasp crawling around on one of our Waspinators one day. All in all, though, I think they're worth the money."
5,It Works!,"Last year we were overrun with wasps in our front and back yards. I read about the waspinator online and decided to give it a try. In early spring when wasps started showing up we hung 4 of them: two in front and two in back. THEY REALLY WORK! We have an occasional wasp passing through the yard, but they did NOT build nests this year. I highly recommend them and plan to put them out every year from now on. What a relief!"
3,Lacking Quality!,"This item was ok, made of very easily damaged fabric. It did work, but we also hung small paper sacks with brown marker lines on it...it worked as well.One season life span."
1,Does not work,I purchased three for our cabin. Hung up the units in high visibility areas. Even filled up the bag with plastic bags as suggested. I have the units hanging up for three weeks with no deterant for wasp / hornets. We have killed hundreds of wasps with in 5 -15 feet of the hanging unit with a fly swatter. I do know that the wasps are very aggressive this time of year due to seasonal prep for winter. This unit has not worked in any way shape or form. I would say save your money and do not buy this offering.
2,Disappointed,"I really looked forward to receiving the waspinator. I have two paper waspinators but wanted a more realistic one, even though they did work. The disappointment is that the waspinator lasted only about ten days before the top of it started disintegrating. I've had the paper ones for three years and they are still fine. I can only surmise that it should not have been hanging where it was in the sun for several hours. I won't try another since the postage cost more than the item. If you do decide to buy any, be sure to hang it where it is completely sheltered from the sun. My next step will be to get out my sewing machine and make my own!"
1,Vegas wasps can smell a scam when they see one!,"First off, we have the large, slow moving mostly yellow and dark brown wasps here in Vegas. Hung this up at night around the pool directly in the path of the those stupid (well maybe I'm stupid for thinking this would work) wasps. At first light I was up getting ready for work and thought I would just check the pool and see whats going on. Well, there were 3 wasps in the pool taking water back to the nest and when I went outside to get a closer look, there was a wasp actually coming out of the bottom of the waspinator! Like it was going to fight whatever was in there! It flew out of the waspinator and landed in the pool to get some water for it's nest! All of the wasps fly right by the waspinator to get back home. It has done nothing to keep them away. May work elsewhere but not here or at least in my yard. Product is easy to set up though, that earned it a 1 star."
3,they mocked me,the reason i'm not giving this product a 1 or 2 is b/c it did work for most of the season...but then i noticed a FEW wasps again..not tons..only a few. When i took the Waspinator down thinking maybe i need to put a new one up..the wise as*es built a nest IN the Waspinator...go figure.
5,Great for frying,A friend told me to use grapeseed oil as it doesn't flame up like olive oil can. Tastes good too.
5,North American Falconry and Hunting Hawks,The most comprehensive book printed on Falconry in North America. Now in it's 8th edition.
3,"Undoubtedly the Falconry Bible, but by no means an easy read","This is without a doubt the primary resource for falconers across North America and quite possibly the world. It is an invaluable reference towards attaining a falconry license, trapping, training and caring for a bird. Howerver it is printed by a small independent outfit that quite often has trouble keeping up with demand, and the book is in serious need of an editor, as it abounds with spelling and grammatical errors."
5,Great product.,This fitness vest is fantastic! The best purchase of fitness equipment I've made. It really works. The shipping was FAST and economical. Quality is top notch.
1,Ridiculous,"This thing does nothing but shake the heck out of your arms when you play. It is at times comical. It makes your controller rattle, you hear shaking noises, and feel like you are having some sort of seizure.This tremor pack thing will die off in my opinion. It will go the way of Robbie the Robot for the NES. Remember him? Neither does anybody else...It is an interesting idea, but it doesn't really enhance the games. Just because the controller shakes in your hands doesn't mean you feel like part of the game. In fact, with all the shaking, it might even disrupt your game play. You are much better off getting a visual VMU to put in the front slot, at least that enhances your gaming experience. I have this tremor pack and after playing with it for a few hours I took it out and haven't used it since. Don't waste your money on it. That is the best advice I can give."
4,"Nice Job, Interact!","OK, this is a very good ""Jump Pack"". It rumbles alot. And works better then the Sega one...just because this one is'nt ""lincenced"". Who cares? It dose its job, thats all that is important. Also, unlike the N64 rumble pack, this dose not need batteries! The only problom i found whth this product is that it dose not work with Sega GT, which is claimed to be Jump pack compatible. But otherwise, if you are looking for a JUmp pack device, get the Tremor Pack."
1,TERRIBLE....JUST TERRIBLE,As usual Interact accessories dissapoint. This Tremor Pak jumps too hard for what is taking place on screen and absolutely sucks. The slightest action on screen and it wants to jump out of you hand....not good at all. Instead of adding realism to a game it proves to ba an annoyance!AVOID AT ALL COST. Get the official Sega Jump pak instead
3,How much joy can one person handle?,"The Tremor Pak by InterAct is mostly self-explanatory. Designed for the Sega Dreamcast, the jump pack plugs into the bottom slot of the controller and adds (moderate) vibration to game play.What surprised me is the SHEER NUMBER of games that support the Tremor Pak. (These games typically have the label ""Jump Pack compatible"" on them.) From popular new releases to rare Japanese imports, most titles take advantage of the feedback to enhance the gaming experience."
5,Lots of bang for your buck,"I've had this unit since the Dreamcast came out, and I can truly say that the InterAct Tremor Pak has never failed me yet. Hydro Thunder, House of the Dead 2, Sonic, they ALL have been a lot more fun with the pak. Highly recommended."
4,Should have been built into the original controller,"Almost every Dreamcast game supports the jump pack feature. This is because the feedback mechanism adds an extra dimension of fun and interactivity to games. If you are wondering if it is worth the [price] to add this to your controller - yes it is.My only complaint is that the jump pack should have been built into the original controller. This feature is near standard in all games and it seems like a crass money grab by Sega to force you to buy a second device.I have not tried all of the jump pack devices. However, I have tried the TremorPak and the Dreamcast device. I can't really tell a difference other than that the TremorPak seems to vibrate a little stronger than the Dreamcast device. As far as compatibility is concerned, it has worked in all of my games...it has my vote."
4,Best Force Feedback Peripheral for Dreamcast,"As I've said of the ""Performance"" line of products, they're made to sell for a cheap price. In this case, this theory works well. The TremorPak is the best force-feedback peripheral available for Dreamcast. It functions perfectly with all games that are compatible with it, and it has never skipped a jolt. However, since this is a third-party device, it isn't made to fit like a glove into the Dreamcast controller. It's just a tad too small. Therefore, when it vibrates, it makes an annoying noise from clicking against the walls of the controller port. This never seems to affect gameplay, but it can get rather annoying. Regardless, the TremorPak has the most intense feedback of the Dreamcast vibration packs."
1,horrible quality,"I should also have read the reviews. The pole does not support the arm and shade, so the lamp leans over. It looks terrible. Am returning it immediately."
1,Very bad quality and could not assemble it.,I should have read review first. I bought a chrome one. (This one was sold out already) I could not get the poles fit together. It was a very aweful experience!
1,Horrible Lamp!,"First, it's very poor quality. Scratches easily. Extremely heavy. Second, it's impossible to assemble! Instructions are the worst I've seen, pieces do not fit together (they fit together?). I spent 3 hours trying to figure it out, then gave up. I'm returning it."
2,"Waste of money and time because 90 percent of the time, it shows the interviews of Tsunami survivors from all over the word","It's a waste of money and time because 90 percent of the time, this DVD shows the interviews of Tsunami survivors from all over the world. It spends about 10 minutes talking about the cause of the tsunamis and the measures taken by some countries to look out for the arrival of the next ones. However, it also states nobody knows these measures will save lives.Also, as reviewer, Himanshu Shangari, said it missed recent ones that hit Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia and Japan in March 2011. It's because this DVD was released in 2005.If I just wanted to know tsunami disasters happened in the past, I could have searched the Web for free."
1,Obscurity,"I found the majority of these poems obscure and unintelligable. There is also a lack of objects in his poems, their too ""inward"" or something. He has some talent, but these poems don't show it."
2,Not all too easy to light.,The price was right but the charcoal takes a bit of effort to light and get going.
4,mleh,"I discovered this series last year and read a lot of the books in succession. The main thing you notice as you go along is that all of the main plots in the books are annoyingly similar. Guys meets girl, she makes him feel things that no one has ever made him feel before, but he can't get involved with her because of yada yada yada.. still they wind up having sex where he often growls at the taste of her, etc, etc.What keeps me hooked to this series are the side stories. Every book gives you a tiny bit more insight into who and what Acheron is and his relationship with Artemis is really complicated and interesting. Then, of course, there's Nick Gautier's story. The end of ""Seize the Night"" blew me away and I can't wait to see more of Nick.In conclusion, these books are a great and fun read, but if you get bored with the formulaic main plot lines, hang in there for the kickass overall story."
1,What happened to a great series?,"I found this book to be very very average. This series started off so interesting and it seems to me with the last three books the author is just going through the motions, wrapping the conclusions up as fast as possible. Sins of the Night was the worst offender for this.And what is with all the juvenile homophobic remarks in each book? Quite offensive.Hopefully Ash's story will be worth the wait, but after the brilliance of Dance with the Devil, the series has just got cornier and more cliche ridden. It's a shame because the characters and the premise of the story has the capacity to be totally fascinating."
2,Disappointing,"A disappointing read...slow, superficial character development. Okay, it's gothic romance, there's not that high of an expectation for characterization, but the plot is non-existent. For DH fans who're interested in the unfolding tale of Ash's history, SofN gives some back story, but frankly, my $7 could have been better spent. Reserve your copy at the library folks. Save your money."
1,Weak.,"I'm stunned by the high rating the the most recent reviewers have given this book. I'm a huge fan of the first three books in the Dark-Hunter series (I don't include Fantasy Lover in the series, personally, since the hero isn't a D-H) but have been truly surprised by the lack of quality in subsequent stories. Everything seems to be building towards Acheron's story which I'm sure will be great but everything in between is suffering from this lack of plot and attention to detail. Still, there are some interesting little tidbits in this book if you're a fan of the Dark-Hunters and my advice would be to check it out from the library.This book didn't thrill me, but I'm sure I'll get sucked in and pre-order Acheron's book when it eventually comes out. :)"
2,Very Disappointed,"After reading all the other Dark Hunter books in less than 3 months, I was really eager to get started on the newest book. I agree with the other reader that Alexion and Danger were the least exciting couple in the dark hunter series. I found it boring and the storyline just plain blah. However, it did shed some light on Ash and just for that it was worth reading. Hope next one is better!"
5,Wonderful Author,"Love this author, her stories keep you on your toes, I get into the books so much i find my self laughing or crying during the story."
5,Sins of the Night,"This is a well written, fast-paced read. Can be read alone or as one in the series. Loved it!"
3,Not as Good,"I am a big fan of Ms. Kenyon and have all her books, however I was disappointed with this one. It does not measure up to the standards she set with her previous DH books. The story was uneventful, the interaction of the characters stilted, and the sex was bland. I will keep it as I want my set complete, but it is one I will skip when rereading them."
3,Least favorite of the DH series,"While all of the DH books are fantasy, this one was the 'most out-there' of all of them so far. Kenyon just doesn't develop Zarek and Danger enough to make it believable that a Shade and a soulless dark hunter could suddenly develop emotions and feelings. It just didn't tie in that well with the rest of the series, and it left me wondering if the rest of the series is like this, then I don't know if I want to spend any more money on the books."
3,"Not bad, but not the best either","I felt the romance was weak in this entry of Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series. However, it introduced some new material into the mythology that made it a worthwhile read. I always enjoy getting more information on Acheron, even indirectly. What happens when Dark-Hunters go bad and try to use their power as they see fit? Acheron sends in Alexion. The title, that is now also his name, marks him as a servant of Acheron. And he is here to judge whether Danger St. Richard needs to be executed for mutiny.Alexion's backstory is more interesting than his romance with Danger. I'm not sure if I found the romance lacking because this is the first entry to have a female Dark-Hunter, or just because Alexion was so different a character. He is completely unique. Never-the-less, I enjoyed the book and do recommend it. It gives some new insight into Ash, as well as a look into his home. But, it's not one I'll be re-reading."
3,Not the best..........,"I am a huge fan of Sherrilyn Kenyon novels. Having read all of her previous Dark Hunter stories I was rather disappointed with this latest installment in the series. Perhaps it was due to the sense of urgency in the plot; time contraints written into the story rushed the development of passion and love between the two main characters.The book did offer a further glimpse into the world of Archeron, allowing the reader to learn more about his past and suggesting what might lay ahead for him in future novels. I would have to recommend Sins of the Night if you are anxious to discover Archeron's secrets and how he came into existence."
4,Enjoyed this book!,"I have noticed that the author has some hits and misses in this dark hunter series. This was definitely a hit! She mixed the right amount of sexual tension and attraction while advancing the DH mythology and storyline. You felt for both the hero and heroine in this story even though they were both allowed to be weak at times.I think the only part I didn't like was the demon sub story. But I guess that will ultimately depend on where it eventually ends up. Ach, as always, hot!Good work!"
3,Decent,"This book is very in depth and very thought through. I did, however, find it hard to follow some of the times, but you can work your way through it. I love Kenyon's writing style, so it wouldn't hinder me from continuing her novels."
4,i'm glad i tried this new author,"sort of a vampire book, sort of not.. this is part of a series that i hadn't read before. it's got fighting and demons and ancient people... just the sort of thing that will keep your attention. do read it."
4,"not bad, not perfect","Shipping was pretty excellent, but the condition was not what I expected. Still, I got what I paid for."
1,Did not work,"Anyone buying the latest version of Tomtom One should not buy the SD disk version of the Western European map. It isn't compatible. Instead, download the map from Tomtom Home. Also, the version of Home that comes with TomTom One is outdated. You'll need to download the latest version from the Tomtom website.I did return the SD disk and got a refund in a timely manner."
1,4th season is suddenly awful,"i loved seasons 1-3 but the 4th is awful. don't know what changed to cause it, but now they are the 3 stooges, and jane is a little nasty/snippy diva while awesome good old lovejoy is suddenly kind of a sleazy lying thief, not a rascal with a gleam in his eye, but more like just a crook.for comedy, you should expect to see eric fall in the grass repeatedly and come up with it in his hair and tinker slip and fall in the mud and cry about it.i see bbc now co-listed on the dvd credits beginning this season, so maybe they became more involved to its huge detriment. no idea what changed but this little gem is now suddenly in the 4th season utterly unwatchable for me."
5,Lovejoy season 4,"Always love Lovejoy,no matter what. I can see changes coming,but the stories always make my day. Recommend it for anyone who likes Ian or Lovejoy"
2,I expected more.,"It is just not much of a book. It has two variations of the same bread repeated twenty times. Check your old ""Betty Crocker Cook Book""."
5,her best accomplishment yet,i first read this book when i was younger. then going back and reading it later in my life i realized how good of a book it was. Juniper is Monica Furlongs best accomplishment in my opinion. Then book shows us that we are all different and all have our own different talents and powers in a way. i sugguest that everyone read this book.
3,Twists and turns!,"This is vintage Robert Littell, featuring convoluted twists of plot, and of course, the strange eccentric character. ""The Sisters"" is about the crime of the century, and more would be telling.This is a believable (but fictional) tale of espionage and betrayal. At only about 300 pages, it moves the reader briskly towards its conclusion. The author's prose, as always, is well done and holds the reader's interest. In my humble (but no doubt controversial) opinion, Littell is a much clearer writer than Le Carre, and his characters are more memorable. Recommended. RJB."
3,A little-bit dated spy novel,"Having read ""The Company"" some time ago and thoroughly enjoying it, I thought I might get much the same with ""The Sisters."" I guess since the Soviet Union has become a shadow of its prior threat, and this tome is still about that era, I couldn't get excited about this story. It was a capable writing job, but just too predictable."
1,Hate it,This book was not what I was expecting. I didnt really like anything about it or even the author. I will not recommend.
1,LeCarre & Deighton he isn't !,"This was a very ordinary spy novel. Nothing outstanding and nothing that suspensful. Way too many coincidences and not enough reality such as a LeCarre or Deigton would have.. If this book were a movie it would be classified as ""B"".....This is the first Littel book that I've read. Some reviews stated that Littel was in the genre of the great spy masters. Based on that info I purchased this one and one called The Company... Well, in the lexicon of Howard Cossell; "" Fugetaboutit""!! He is a long, long way from the Masters ..."
5,The best book on sexuality and the church I've found.,"This book isn't a commentary on the church's (ELCA) stances on sexuality. Instead, it's a book that provides a framework for dealing with human sexuality (regardless of orientation, marital status, etc). Too often the church just says ""no sex outside marriage"" with no other specific advice and no mention of the fact that we all have hormones. This book, in keeping with Luther's tradition of Scripture, Tradition, and Reason, explores sexuality as a gift that comes with responsibilities. A great read for a young adult, and I really wish it'd been given to me when I was in highschool as part of the church's sex ed curriculum."
3,Not bad......,"This book is a bit formulaic, woman wakes up with a strange man(innocently of course), man wants woman to ""pose as his fiancee"" to relieve the mind of his sick grandfather, and we have a romance novel. The book was entertaining although I found the hero to be a liar, spoiled and very manipulative. The heroine was almost too naive, but it was a quick read and accomplished it's purpose."
3,Worth the Read,Ms Thorpe should have let reader know how Zac feels about Jessica. The way the ploy alternated between arguments & intimacy proved a little distracting for me. Jessica's relationship with Zac's family made for the last 3 pages. Overall a good read.
2,"Do not pay for this, at this price!","These Avery photo pages are to be sold at a retail price of $4.96. The seller is selling it at almost twice the retail price, ridiculous! These are nice but honestly do not pay more than a retail price! Rip off!"
3,Much cheaper at stores!,I was able to get a 100 pack of these for less than the 10 pack on Amazon. That's pretty unusual. It was at Adorama in NYC.
1,"Wrong information - A page holds THREE pictures, NOT SIX.","Each page only holds THREE pictures, although in the description says it holds 6... I feel like I spent two times more money then I should have paid. You can only insert pictures on one side of the page. I was expecting it to hold pictures on both sides. Upset customer..."
4,"Reliable, and Anti-bacterial microfiltration on top of that.","I've used these for years and they're great. Lately, I purchased them from B&M Housewares. Although my first order from the latter turned out to be the incorrect product, B&M Housewares sent me a replacement at no additional costs, and with very little fuss. I'm inclined to buy from them again for all my vacuuming needs."
1,NOT for Panasonic U-6,Do NOT use this product for a Panasonic U-6. On first use my vacuum starting making a strange noise and stopped picking up dirt from the carpet. The one star is for the Panasonic U-6. It may work on the other sizes.
5,best price - slow but right on,these bags are what I asked for - best price - right product - just a bit slow in getting here.
3,I'm glad they work!,"I was looking for U-6 bags for my vacuum cleaner. They sent me U, U-3 bags. I think they should take they U-6 out of their discription. But at least they are working for me. The bags are a lot smaller than what I'm used to. But they are working."
1,??,"I couldn't get it to work for me and found it easier to simply reinstall all programs (a chore) and copy ""documents and settings folder"" (easy)"
4,Excellent but not Television,"Tom Verlaine's solo works are not up to the standards of Television. This first solo album had some of Tom Verlaine's best material but suffered from the lack of counterpoint guitar from the incredibly underrated Richard Lloyd. (Listen to Richard Lloyd's solo stuff and it contains remarkable guitar and incredibly trite lyrics). You have to give it up for Breakin In My Heart which is one of my alltime favorite songs period. It has a great buildup and fantastic guitar solos. Verlaine's guitar work was always meandering but this builds to a great climax. Also enjoyable is Yonki Time (great cutup stuff), Flash Lightning, Red Leaves and Mr. Bingo. The other songs are okay but not up to these standards. If you took all of Tom Verlaine's solo stuff and made a greatest hits album, you would have a definite 5 star outing."
2,TV could've done better.,Catchy hooks are undermined by a lack of depth and color. Tunes begin to grow tiresome after just a scant few listens. For Tom Verlaine fanatics only.
2,So So,"This book offers little in the way of things you always wanted to know. I found the layout quite annoying. I had to keep flipping the book on it's side to read what was written on the sides. I got a headache after reading it.If you're a fan of the Real World you should skip this book and get the ""Ultimate Insiders Guide."" It has more information and is better on the eyes!"
5,Almighty Heroes,"It's very refreshing to find a series of toys that represent the values we believe in. This is Noah. Young Noah travels the ancient world. He learns to make friends with all of God's wonderful creations. Noah's best friends were the animals and all of God's creatures great and small that he loved so much. God smiled at Noah because he saw him as a good, kind and gentle young man. Noah learned to build boats and God chose Noah to save all creatures from a great flood. All the characters in this series are well built and withstand lots of play."
3,Not what I thought,"I read on the description that this charm fits most major charm bracelets. I assumed it would fit Pandora. However, it does not. It is more of a rectangular clip and will not fit the circular shape of the pandora. However, it was a nice charm and would be great for the correct bracelet."
5,Bass by Pettiford/Burke,"I think this is a great album. The song that a previous reviewer was probably talking about was ""Softly, as in a Morning Sunrise"". It is a solo by bass player and my dad, Vinnie Burke.Both bassists do a fine job of not only entertaining but allowing us to feel the heart and soul of their instrument."
3,Indie blood and boobs,"Probably a 2 star movie overall, but I am generally willing to give low budget indie films the benefit of an extra star. The flick starts a bit slowly, but when the action picks up, its a decent little slasher cult film (meaning cult of slashers, not cult classic). It's also got Gunnar Hansen. The world needs more Gunnar Hansen.If you don't like your flicks on video, stay away. If you don't like low-budget production values, stay away. If you don't like blood and boobs, definitely stay away."
2,gimme me a way out of this movie,just cause u have a camcorder and u took a couple of classes does not mean u can make a horror movie like john carpenter.also shooting blood onto people does not make it gore.
2,Disappointed,"I have to say I was a bit disappointed with this purchase. Very flimsy, and not as easy to put up as they claim. It's best to have two people for sure! Although I thought it was pretty but you can easily scratch it (especially when putting it together) Just cheaply made, but....I guess you get what you pay for! I wouldn't recommend the head or heart ache..keep browsing."
4,i'm 34 and i enjoyed the book,"So this book is designed to entertain the minds of young kids. I didn't know that until after i read the book. This book lacks a lot of the details about the game of soccer, but it gives a decent overview of the rules and strategies. The pictures are really great and in full color. Throughout the book, websites are mentioned which will lead you to all kinds of detailed info on soccer. The book also describes records for numerous categories, like goals in a game, most red cards in a game, most own goals in a game(139!), etc.The second half of the book highlights individual players as well as great teams over the history of the sport.In conclusion, this book is not designed to teach you how to play soccer, it's not going to help you improve your game, it's not going to show you how to kick a ball properly, or how to properly play defense. It's some cozy reading material to give you an overview of the history of soccer. 4 stars instead of 5 because i like details!"
5,Very good book.,"Of all the books I've read on the subject of the history of the catholic/protestant scism, this is probably the best. If you have trouble reading small print, better get a good pair of magnifying glasses, cause Ray has alot of footnotes throughout, and they're as interesting as the body of the book itself. There is so much I never knew about the Church as an evan gelical christian. This book is informative, and he does not ever come across negative towards protestantism. He just pretty much relates his and his family's personal journey, and then goes into great delay on the teachings of Baptism and The Eucharist. I think alot of Catholics who've never left the church could be inspired by this writer. I'm reading it for the 2nd time, and gleaning more this time than the first!"
2,Too much misinformation to be credible,"On the positive side,the story of Mr. Ray's journey is reasonably well told. However, there is a fundamental error in logic he makes by imputing his experiences within the Baptist church to all Protestant churches. For example, he states that baptims and communion are ""no longer called sacraments by Evangelicals and Fundamentalists. (p27). I've attended 4 different churches in 4 different states over the past 20 years and never experienced this (or many of the other assertions made, such as ""cavalier"" treatment of the Bible, p48). His citation of the Westminster Confession is incorrect. He misses the point of ""solo scriptura."" If you have changed from Protestant to Catholic and wish to justify your decision, this book is for you."
1,Space Alien Trasubstantiation,"The world of contemporary Catholic apologetics is getting stranger and stranger. This fellow appeared on Catholic cable to say that he instraucts children in the Catholic doctrine of Transubstatiation in following way. First he disaparages their general feeling of reality by saying that much of what their senses perceive is faulty. And then, second, he literally says that a ""space alien"" has instructed us that even though our senses perceive only bread and wine, once again they are faulty. The ""space alien"" tells them of transubstantiation and that the space alien is Jesus, according to Ray, who has come to liberate us from our frequently faulty perceptions. And I thought I had it hard growing up Catholic! With these new church apologists for new generation we better hope no one names themselves Do Re Ti Fa La Ti or Do, and rents a big house on the outskirts of San Diego. ""Cause this character Steve Ray kinda already looked the part!"
4,Worth the money,"Of the many texts available on providing evidence to the non-Catholic for Catholic doctrine, Stephen Ray's texts are among the best researched and in-depth texts available, while still being easily readable.Also to mention- it is interesting how most of these reviews are plagued by a mysterious ""reader"" who will not give his name and only trumpet how horrible Catholicism is, without giving adequate reasons for his dislike of any texts beyond ""it's not in the Bible"". I seriously doubt our reader has even opened this, or other Catholic texts. Likely an indoctorinated anti-catholic, parroting others, I challenge him to find a Catholic forum and prove his position (www.catholicboard.com, www.flyfreeministries.org, www.phatmass.com)."
5,Wow. Church Fathers Speak,"This is truely an amazing book that every Christian should read. It draws heavily from the Old Testament, New Testament, and early Church Fathers to show that the Catholic Church is what it claims to be - the Church Jesus promised his disciples, for this is the only Church that adheres to the teachings of the apostolic tradition and early Church Fathers. I love to challenge my Protestant friends to read it. It encourages discussion about the real issues, not religious prejudice. I also love that Ray does not feel the need to bash the Protestant tradition. This is important. Though he exposes their shallow theology and even how modern Protestantism disagrees with the thought of Calvin, Luther, and other Reformers, he does not denigrate it. Truely, Truely, a great read."
2,The Best Book on Ancient Egypt Ever Written,"""Secrets of the Great Pyramid"" by Peter Tompkins is my all around fovorite book. I have been reading this book for the past 30 years and its still a delight to open its pages for another discovery. The most valuable part of this book is the appendix written by Livio Catullo Stecchini. Stecchini is perhaps the most educated author I have ever read and he writes with facts and figures - not assumptions as do many other authors on this subject. ""Secrets of the Great Pyramid"" is an enigma that gradually reveals itself, supplying all the pieces of the puzzle on this sacred journey - but you will have to dig deep in the end!"
2,A good list...,"Tompkins book is a good list of the works of those who have researched the pyramid themselves. To make use of the varied and stimulating ideas he reiterates, it's necessary to go to his sources. I'd advise starting with Smyth if you can put up with his religeous overtones. Overall a light read, but well done."
4,Objective analysis of the origins of the great pyramid,"One of the better books I have read dealing withthe possible origins of the great pyramid. Itis ojective and candidly written, and covers themany extant theories of the pyramid's originsin good detail. Also good coverage of the probablemeasures used by the original architect, withmeasured speculation on the possible encodedmeanings embodied in the various dimensions. Compellingarguments for alternative uses of the pyramid(e.g. as an astronomical observatory) during and afterits construction. This book has certainly fueledmy imagination to a greater extent than any otherbook written about the great pyramid."
1,Not what it used to be...,Magazine quality has drastically slipped in the last two years. Articles are published blatantly giving credit to people who don't deserve it and the editors acknowledge this without apology. Majority of issues are now mainly filled with pictures of readers' vehicles with technical data while quality articles have become few and far in between.
3,interesting,"For those wondering about the flavor of this gum I would describe it as being very similar to cinnamon with kind of a musky floral scent. It isn't unpleasant. however it isn't sugar free which is preferable for most kinds of gum now. The actual gum is very hard and loses flavor quickly, not recommended for those with sensitive teeth.Overall I like it, but it is different."
5,This book is still in print and readily available,"This book has never gone out of print and is readily available from the publisher, Probe Books, in Richardson, TX. The Publisher can fill any order from amazon. The same publisher supplies ""The Gospel and the Greeks"", also available from amazon. The book investigates the reasons for the deplorable state of education in America's government schools and also in America's colleges and universities."
5,Fully Satisfied,This large airflow pad is strong and super absorbent. The larger size aids in patient movement and transfer.
4,A Good Addition to the Collection,"This was probably my son's favorite christmas gift one year, he was 3 at the time. He loves rescue heroes, and these are comparable in size, not in weight or quality, but they can take a beating nonetheless. The paint job on these things is also pretty funny. My husband asked why Moses was wearing lipstick, but my son doesn't care about the historically inaccurate outfits or lipshade so these get a two thumbs up. The book that comes with the set is just okay. I would recommend reading from a children's bible instead."
4,different packaging from earlier release,"This is great stuff and it's nice to see it available again since it has been out of print for a long time. Since the product description is so minimal, however, you should just know before you order that the reissue version skimps mightily on the packaging compared to the ecstatic peace version from several years back. Again, if all you care about is the music, it is the same, but it's just not as nice of a fetish object as the original."
2,too little information on fashion photography,This book talked mainly about the pictures in this book and not about actually doing fashion photography as well as working with models. I don't think it gave enough information about model photography that an acquiring mind would want to know. Also I realized that a lot of the pictures in the book were suppose to be in color but they were printed B&W.
2,Could be more consistent and in color.,"I was very disappointed in Amherst and Mr. Pegram. The effort fell considerably short of a book geared toward instruction. Mr. Pegram continually makes reference to how he shot the subject, but never shows the effect of his tips, because the images are in B/W. Sometimes Billy informs you technically how he pulled the shoot off and other times it is a mystery. Amherst has been in the Photography instruction publishing business a long time, but I feel they should have stepped up and consulted with Mr. Pegram and published the book in color. BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME! How about a refund??????????????????????????????????????"
3,Has its Moments,"I was hoping for more in depth interviews and insights into Lynch's film making. This definitely has its moments, but not enough of them. I'm a Lynch devotee, and glad I saw this despite its disappointing general lack of insight. I hope the next two in the series are more revealing."
4,Very useful book,This book is very useful when you have either to draft or to read and discuss a term sheet during an investment round.
3,Term Sheets & Valuations - A Line by Line Look at the Intricacies of Venture Capital Term Sheets & Valuations,"Good general overview for those who know very little about venture capital financing. However, if you are a professional involved in the business, then this book is very rudimentary."
2,A Big Disappointment,"This book addresses a critical need in the market: a practical, clause-by-clause guide to term sheets and valuations for venture capital and other private equity investments. As a former securities lawyer and investment banker, now the Chairman of a private energy company, I had great hopes for this book. Unfortunately, the author fails to deliver. The book is poorly written and superficial. While it is possible to get some basic information from the book, it is little more than a sample term sheet coupled with superficial commentary. Moreover, as with all books published by Aspatore, it is horribly edited. I think these guys just take the author's copy from a Word file and send it to the printers without actually reading it. All in all, a major disappointment."
2,Not necessary to do sit-ups,"I bought this bar because I saw a review that said that you could use it as a pull-up bar as well...that was not the case. The clamp is sturdy but the piece that extends to the footrests is not. Also, you don't need to buy something special to do situps. Just put your feet under a couch if you need the support - for free! I returned it the day I got it."
4,Does it's job.,"The TKO doorway sit up bar works flawlessly one sit up after another. To be honest, I'm not really sure how it does it. It could be a mechanical piece of a god-like magnitude or it could be just pure magic forged from the dreams and wishes of children around the world. I really don't know. What I do know is that it plain and simply works to no undetermined degree."
5,Great product,The quality of this product is superior. It is easy to attach and remove. I couldn't have asked for anything more. Thanks.
1,Don't bother,"I picked up this book hoping that the author recognized the glut of books with the theme of, ""Keep your chin up and you'll soon get married and live happily ever after"" and instead write a book for those who are satisfied with their lives and just looking for some advice on how to address the people and situations in life that assume you're incontent.I was sorely disappointed. They can keep the money I paid for this book, I just want my time back."
2,Not bad information - just narrow data / reasoning,"I read this entire book when it came out. The author makes good points but I have found that her points are narrow in perspective. She could have included more motivating speak in her arguments for some of the suggested points. I found the book's content actually covered things that seemed common sense, but perhaps some folk might it useful.I simply didn't read anything that stood out different. Since reading this book, I have found someone simply being me.That was a point in her book."
4,Interesting Perspective,This book expresses an interesting perspective about the interactions between men and women and I liked it. If you liked this book may I suggest you read (STUMBLING NAKED IN THE DARK: OVERCOMING MISTAKES MEN MAKE WITH WOMEN.) Within Stumbling it explains why there are so many women still single in their 30's now and why this is such a problem that is not getting better.
2,Too OTT,"This book did contain some very very good nuggets of information. However, in general, much of the advice just seemed WAY too extreme for the Irish and English markets. Were I to send cards to EVERYONE I knew, asking them to set me up, they'd have me sectioned! I'd advise simply reading the excerpts from this on Oprah.com."
4,so glad she took the time to write it,"I found ""find a husband after 35 very helpful with Ms. Greenwald's 15 step program - not all good for me but some ideas well worth trying - have already used several and I think I may be the next one ""down the aisle"" --- hope you will also ----"
2,Save your money,"This book was not helpful. Basicly, if you're over weight, she can't help you until you loose weight."
2,Great conversation starter,"I purchased this book after hearing the author give a radio interview discussing the plight of older, intelligent women finding a man. I use this book for comic relief. Despite her intelligence, the author pretends that matters of the heart can follow a prescribed recipe. I doubt that anyone who followed much of the author's advice would have a self-esteem left. But isn't that what it takes to find a relationship that you can be submissive in, give up your intellect and self-respect to HAVE A MAN! Stop the insanity of self-help for relationships."
1,Totally Unrealistic & Useless,"This book is a joke! The tips Rachel suggests are ridiculous, and if you use them you're going to look like a desparate looser. Are you really going to have a friend call the guy who dumped you and ask why? I think that guy will say, ""I dumped you because you have your friends conduct exit interviews!"" Finding a husband is NOT like running a business. Rachel wasn't over 35 when she got married, so it appears, so this is a [lie]. Don't waste your time or money!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,"Greenwald's idea is unrealistic and will make you seem desperate. She has this full throttle approach, and it's demeaning. Instead of treating a husband like a commodity, treat him like a person. And most of all, be yourself, not someone you should be to get a man as Greenwald suggests. This is utter B.S."
2,Unsatisfied,"I bought this book because the title was catchy and because I'm interested in meeting my husband. Unfortunately I found the book to be disappointing for the following reasons: 1)The author's writing shouted at me as if I were an 18 year old Army recruit. 2)For anyone who has been single a while, these ideas are not new, and 3)While I'm all for looking my best, being encouraged to grow my hair long and buy a push-up bra to maximize my visual appeal is insulting to me and to the man I want to attract. My suggestion: take the money you would have spent on the book and apply it to doing something you ABSOLUTELY LOVE...something that makes you feel alive from the inside out. In the end the only way to win at finding a husband is to win at finding a life."
4,Smart,"I think this book is very smart. It made me think about dating in a whole new way, and at age 58 being back in the dating market for 8 years, that's really saying something! The ideas are really creative - I can't wait to try them out, espcially Step #9."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a horrible book. I can't believe I wasted money on it. The author believes that if finding a husband is not a priority aboved your job, friends, family etc. that you aren't really committed to meeting someone. She also believes you should quit your job and find a new one if you aren't in a field with a lot of men in it. Well, there goes my career as a preschool teacher. She also says you should be willing to relocate to a city, town, neighborhood that has more available men. She also wants you to call everyone you know including your mechanic, obgyn, pastor etc. and tell them you are looking for a husband. PLEASE save your money. This book is an embarassment to all single women out there!"
1,Stupid book. nothing that i have not known.,"Stupid book. nothing that i have not known. Too bad for the word ""Harvard"", because I was expecting something clever and creative."
2,A No Go,"Unless you are just clueless this book has nothing to offer you. It is all the standard stuff you've heard before: Stay trim, be sexy, etc. etc."
5,Definitive work on MArketing,"By taking a hard sell product, Greenwald has written a definitive work on marketing"
3,Check the library before you buy...,"I will be honest; I have not read this book. But I am suspicious about these two rave reviews that appeared the first day the book was published, especially the one that seems to claim to know how your life will change after implementing this just-published program. Also, a 336-page book may not have much substance if you can read it in one day, as the other review claims. Check the book at your local library first. If you like it, by all means, buy it from Amazon.com."
1,"Down with Therapy, Up with Madison Avenue","Rachel Greenwald certainly knows her market - many singles over 35. I'm sure this book is a bestseller due to the ""epidemic"" of single people.Telling people to bury their baggage seems to be dangerous advice. Then on step 13, you can go back to being who you are as a break from your search.Some chapters are good - Ms. Greenwald certainly did her research on internet dating.It would be interesting to interview the husbands of her successful clients. Did they know who their wife was after they returned from the honeymoon?Overall - good as a reference, not as a program."
3,But why?,"The strategy is perhaps useful, but I think the author forgot the most important part--in order to find a spouse and have a successful relationship, the focus cannot be on yourself 100% of the time! What you have to ""market"" are genuine love and concern for someone else, whose interests have to be put ahead of your own, many, many times. If you cannot commit to that, you will find a partner, but you will not keep him/her."
3,microphone isn't a speaker,"Yes it records well but without playback capability. I was under the impression that it had tiny speakers, as it says so in the text, but here ""speaker"" means microphone. Oh well, I guess I'll just go get a tiny tape recorder like I should have gotten in the first place."
4,a little about Griffin's iTalk,"I really like this thing. It's pretty simple and easy to use; just plug it in and go. My only complaints are these: it does speech easily, but if you sing or play music (which I do) then you get some noticeable distortion, namely popping. Another thing, if you are using a hard drive iPod (like the iPod Classic) the iTalk picks up the sound of the hard drive and such moving around inside the iPod. No such problem when I plugged it into my old Nano, which is a flashdrive type. Even so, I give it 4 stars. Great machine, a nice gadget for anyone, especially college kids and anyone who plays music and has an idea that they want to record quickly and then come back to later."
4,Watch Compatibility,"The push button record feature does not work on the Classic. Even though it only claims to work with the 5th generation video, I thought I'd give it a shot. It still works great as a microphone, just with manual start/stop."
1,iTalk didn't work,I don't know if it is the equitment or my ipod but it did not work. 1. If you have an ipod touch 3rd gen DO NOT BUY! 2. Make sure it is compatible 3. Just don't buy it.
1,Will NOT work with 1-st Gen Nano,"OK this is a review of the product listing instead of the product, because I haven't been able to use the iTalk on my Nano. It does NOT work with first-generation Nanos, only with the new aluminum-case ones. This was not clearly or explicitly stated on this Amazon page or the product page at Griffin's website. Ugh. Now I have to return it and find something else - what a pain!"
3,"OK, but messes with my nano","I purchases the italk for recording messages and lectures. It does an excellent job of recording in high qulaity sound. In fact, it's hard to believe how clear it records. However, even though it was advertized to work with the 2nd generation nanos (on the manufacturers website), it messes with my nano, every time I use it, making do various strange things like quickly running through a play list without ever playing a song, playing songs that aren't what is showing in the display, freezing the ipod, and freezing on a dead screen. I think it would be an awesome microphone if it wouldn't mess with my hardware."
5,iPod Recorder,Very easy to use and has great recording quality. Highly recommend for class recordings and the like...
3,I like the iTalk Pro,"The iTalk Pro is a good product. I like it's look and design. It blends seemlessly with my black ipod. It's small easy to attach and use. It can record with very high quality or low quality. I recommend using high gain when recording a lecture. I wish it had speakers to play back what was recorded. (I thought it did when I bought it). Overall, I'm happy with it, however I wish it cost a little less."
1,Does NOT work with IPod Touch !,The ITalk Pro is not compatible with IPod Touch!When you connect it to the Ipod touch it automatically disconnect the external speakers. On top of that the microphone doesn't work (it does work with my ipod Nano).I purchased the Italk for VOIP (Skype) but it does not work with any of the apps.
1,Problems,I used this device to record family members watching a dvd of converted 8mm family movies so I could add the recording as narration. Large random chunks of the recording were missing. I couldn't tell if the recorder stops automatically during quiet periods. The manual/specs didn't say anything about that. Garbage.
1,unsuitable for music because it skips constantly...,"unsuitable for music because it skips constantly...very disappointing!don't buy this if you want to use it for music!it works with my 2nd generation ipod nano, but it noticeably skips constantly.it's fine for voice memos, but why bother building a stereo mic then...?very disappointed by Griffin!i would have returned it, but I gave it to a friend to record his lectures instead."
2,Could be worse.,"Any professional classical singers who are looking for something to use for your voice lessons or hoping for something that will give you good quality recordings for demo cd's: find something else. This thing works great for dictation, but is not equipped to deal with that much sound. It cuts out and skips several seconds at a time. Also, the description says that it has speakers. It doesn't. Perhaps a mistake (although repeated several times), but nevertheless, a fallacy. But like I said, it was fine for dictation."
5,excellent product,"I found this recording device to be excellent. It suits my needs of recording live music lessons and performances. It is so small and lightweight, but sometimes I lose it in the backpack!-"
4,Lacking speaker capability.,"A nice microphone to use for recording class lectures but lacks speaker capability. Unlike it's predecessor that allows you to use it as a speaker for listening to your recordings, this one doesn't have it. I was dissapointed when I realized that this one doesn't have that feature."
1,not recieved,"I have not recieved this product and the people who I buy it, they have been absolutelydeaf to my request they are only for the money not for the costumer service..."
1,not with nano 3G,"This may work fine if you have the right ipod. Nowhere in the description does it say that it only works with 2nd generation nano and 5th generation video ipod. I have a 3G nano, and the italk doesn't work at all with it. So, now I need to return it minus a restocking fee."
1,iTalk Pro a huge disappointment,"I had an older model iTalk with my old iPod, which worked great! When I had to replace my iPod with a newer model, I immediately ordered a new iTalk Pro. What a disappointment! The recordings are full of pops and hisses, unlike my old one, which recorded as clear as a bell. These are virtually unusable recordings unless you have very sophisticated audio cleaning software, and even then they are barely passable to listen to. This device was a total waste of money, unfortunately. Maybe I just got a bad one, but it is of exceedingly poor quality."
3,Good for audio capture.,"Using an iPod Nano G2, this product worked exactly as stated. I wouldn't use it for anything resembling hi-fi, but it definitely does the job for any audio you're willing to accept some loss of fidelity with, such as spoken seminars, or just conveying the general idea, if not the exact performance of live music."
1,Not for iPod Touch,"For some reason I thought this would work with my new 2nd Generation iPod Touch. It does not. Maybe it's not designed for the iPod Touch, but it would be nice if the advertisement for this was more specific. I may return it or give it to my daughter to use with her Nano (if it works...we'll see)."
1,Not worth the money,"This is billed as the first device to record to an MP3 player *in stereo*. Unfortunately, to record in stereo you need to have it on high quality. As reported, the sound you get then fades in and out and skips. Even at low quality, the sound fades in and out. I'm not sure why CNET gave it a good review. I wonder if they even listened to anything they recorded with it. No useable and not worth the money."
4,Griffin iTalk Pro,It does what its supposed to do. Got it for a good price and it works effectively. The product saps up a LOT of battery power on your iPod. You will need to recharge your iPod after a two-hour lecture before the next use.
3,Great.. until it breaks.,"The quality of the audio from this unit is just ok.. plug in a high quality shotgun or stereo mic for better sound. The built in mics would be fine if you could adjust the gain, but since you can't you will get very peaky and poppy audio when speaking directly to the device.You will also hear the ipod HD spin up and cycle while using the built in mics. This is not the recorder for serious podcasting unless you are using something to control the volume before it goes in to the italk. Something like a portable 4 track or just a mini-mixer should do the trick. But if you are going to the trouble to set all of that up you probably want something to record to that isn't going to run out of battery so quickly.I'm sure it had something to do with the way I carried it around in my pocket but the built in mics are now shot.. I didn't smash it or drop it.. just put it in my pocket with my keys for about 5 mins.. now the mics are all messed up. A little durability would be nice.[...]"
3,A Great Product---If your iPod is new enough,"I would like to make it very clear here that this device only and I repeat only works with the newest iPod Nanos (the metallic ones) and the newest iPod Video's. I have an iPod Mini, and, as such, this is more or less entirely useless to me. It is also useless to people with the older Nanos, and the older iPods in general. So buyers beware!"
3,Great for recording class notes,"I used this on my iPod Classic 5th Generation for taking notes of the class lectures. It is fine if you are in the front row of the class. I have also tried to use this to record myself on the piano, but the sound dynamic is not really suitable for that type of recording. This model is only use for old iPod classic's due to the size of the iTalk."
4,Another use for the iPod.,This Griffin iTalk Pro- Microphone turns my iPod into a great replacement for my defunct cassette recorder/player.
2,This is a high review for this one...,"I gave this a high rating for 1 reason: with all that happened in the Earthy card and the Final Judgement, Nelvana was really pressed to find something to cut... so, these episodes remained a bit more intact. But then in the Sand card, Nelvana tried to make up for the missing beginning, so we get a slice of 1 episode, then a 'flashback', which is really scenes from the first episode, minus the introductions...getting confused already? Good. Then go buy the uncut version. I mean, how MUCH do you have to cut out to make 70 25-minute epidodes into 25 something 15-minute ones?"
4,Good product,"Fits well on a 1/10 scale buggy. tight fit, no leaks. it looked a little too small at first, but i cut the fuel line and tried it. good, buy it for your nitro car!"
1,good quality,"Unfortunately, the bracelet (that is pretty) lost the link between the clasp and chain on the third time my daughter was wearing it. I tried to contact the seller and exchange the item for a more expensive one. The new bracelet(rolo) is a very quality one. I actually almost bought the same bracelet in a shopping mall for three times the price. My daughter end up with a better quality bracelet and I am very satisfied with the transaction."
1,Casp fell off after a few wears,The clasp fell off after a few wears and we had to try to put the clasp back on but it kept breaking. My daughter is now without her charm bracelet and we are out $30.
4,Smaller than expected,"Based on the picture, I expected the links to be a bit bigger. Other than that, it looks good."
2,not happy,the product came without the screws to attach the supporting brackets. the material of the rake is not very sturdy. I haven't had a chance to rake yet with the tool since I need to find fitting screws to make it work - super disappointed.
1,Don't buy,I bought this toner about a year ago when my printer said low ink. I put this toner in my printer and the printer will no longer print. Cartridge leaks toner all over when handled. Box says its 100% guaranteed to work. Buyer beware.
3,Hurricane or puff of breath.... two extremes,"This blow dryer has two settings... ""hurricane"" or ""puff of breath"". Not much in between. It's great for getting your hair dry in a hurry, but if you're used to styling with a blow dryer it presents a bit of a challenge. It is fairly light, which is why I bought it. Overall, it is ""OK""."
3,Pretty Nice,"Not a bad little hair dryer. Seems to work well. If I had any criticism it would be when using the low heat setting, it's a bit windier than I would ideally want, and the handle is a little fatter than it needs to be. But all in all, a nice dryer."
3,An ok hair dryer,"I bought this hair dryer because I needed a dual voltage dryer to bring on my study abroad trip to Spain. This hair dryer worked when using the outlet in Spain but not for long. It would start drying then stop. I wouldn't even use it for long. I guess the dryer couldn't handle the power t=for too long and I'd have to wait until I could use it again when it cooled off. Also when on the hi setting, it isn't nearly high enough for me to dry my hair efficiently. Maybe if you have thin hair this would be the hair dryer for you."
5,Convenient Size,Got this to use on my dog who needed to be bathed almost every day. Gets the job done quickly which is what I wanted. Have owned it for five months and hope that it has a long life.
3,"Good, but...","Good little product. However, there is a switch preset at 110 volts. If you bring the air dryer to France, and forget to manually switch it to 220 volts (as we did), the thing burns out within 60 seconds."
1,Dual control does not work,"I ordered 2 of these dryers and both were defective. The directions say to ""use the appropriate tool"" to change voltage, but there is no tool. It is impossible to get the dial to change position. I had to return both original and replacement dryer."
5,They are better then Britney,"Samantha, Natali, Sarah, Karina, Sammi-Jack, form The GEMZ. All unique girls, strut their talent on this CD. And when i say ""talent""...I mean...TALENT. If you haven't seen or heard these girls, I suggest adding this CD to your cart, you'll be sure to thank me...CONGRATS GIRLS ON UR DEBUT ALBUM"
5,AMAZING!,"I LOVE THIS ALBUM! My kids are 10 and 14 and they LOVE this album. The Gemz performed on a 2 week bus tour this past summer and blew my daughter away at her camp. A video was sent to me and the show was full of energy PLUS all the girls and boys of the camp loved them. The campers made t-shirts and dressed wild for the girls. After the show some of the girls from the oldest bunk got to hang out with the gemz and they signed autographs for my daughter.She couldn't stop saying how nice they were and how talented they were. she was very pleased and she heard they are having a concert in central park august 28th, 2005. she is very excited. She can't wait for their next CD due out in october!! but for now, buy this CD! You will be glad you did!"
1,Um...no,"I saw The Gemz perform live at a local fair, and let me just say they weren't the most appealing performance. They would regroup onstage during a performace to make sure what the next step in the routine would be. I was thinking, ""Aren't you performing right now? There's no time to make changes!"" Their voices don't sound remotely normal. The only hope I see for these rather ""overpriced"" gemz is that maybe one day we'll see one of these girls grown up, becoming the new Pop Princess, and laughing at herself when she looks back on this. The Gemz? Um...I'd rather flip on Kidz Bop."
5,Human,"I'd say a little bit uncharacteristic book for Bulychev, between the standard scifi (and qiute boring) ""Passage"", deliriously funny ""Intergalactical Police"" and childish ""Alisa"".My favorite stories here are ""May I speak to Nina"" which is well described by ""Rottenberg's rotten book review"" and ""The first layer of Memory"": the group of speleologists get trapped in a cave. One of them manages to get out, but looses consciousness before he gets to people. He is found some time later. His brain is transplanted to someone else, who starts recalling the already dead speleologist's thoughts - first to visit the old father of one of the guys from the group and give him a cure they found in the cave, and only then he is able to recall where is the exit he found to leave the cave and brings the people to rescue the rest of the team.In general all the stories are very short (sometimes 3-4 pages short) and, I guess, the word that describes them is ""human""."
1,terrible service,Do not ordor from jw for parts if you need to return items they make you pay for shiping and have a 20% Restalk fee.
1,Rip off for the price,This item sells on the 3M site for US$7.99 per case (contains 2 refills).Why is it priced at more than a 1000% mark up here?
5,Milo's Mom,"WOW! Training manuals for working dogs don't come any better than this. Be sure to get Teamwork I as well. If you are visually oriented, buy the DVD's too. This book allows more rapid work than in traditional service dog programs where puppies are raised and then go through intensive training at a facility, then the owner is trained in a marathon of work. This allows you to start with that puppy, make a bond with it and train it to your specific needs. All the tools you need are in this book except, of course, time and a good leash and collar. Federal Laws are listed to know what qualifies your dog as an assistance, service, mobility or guide dog. Very valuable book."
4,good advice,Good book for ideas for training a dog more then just the basics in obedience for a service dog.
4,Specifics on teaching assistance dogs tasks appropriate for help for wheelchair,"This info not available elsewhere as far as I know!Barbara Graham, Cloverdale, CA"
2,Useful for people with mobility impairments,"It is very breif, and lacks a lot of detail, which I would personally have found helpful. It would be useful for those with impaired mobility to find ways to achieve basic obedience and some other skills for their dogs. It is very poor in relation to public access skills and requirements."
5,magic rules,"The new Champions of Kamigawa MTG set is pretty good. There are new abilities like bashido witch is awesome. It has ok decks but i like the old sets better like judgement, and legends. If you like samurai and play MTG GET IT. It is pretty awesome with its spells and abilities. Anyways, if you are a MTG freak get it. They are pretty good.!!!!!!!![...]"
3,"Well, it's an improvement","I have been hoping for an Asian-themed expansion for Magic: the Gathering. I am slightly disappointed, but not by much. It is rich in flavor, as the cards represent a battle between humanity and the spirit world. Many new artists were commisioned for this expansion, giving the cards a fresh air. Also, unlike Mirrodin WotC did not already decice to make this a set where only a few decks could be successully made from these cards. But a lack of some quintessiontally Asian things like ninjas, or giving the creatures more of a ""martial-arts"" feel, hurt the set for the casual player.The new mechanics (Arcane, Bushido) are nothing particularly new and exciting; arcane is a new form of Buyback, and Bushido is a slightly different flanking."
1,This set stinks!!! by Jordan,"What's with these whacky new sets? I hate them. They are not magical at all anymore. Every set after the Scourge (my favorite set) has been so stupid. Mirrodin they put in machines also known as Myr. Machines aren't magical. With kamigawa there are no more beasts, angels, etc. All they have are stupid spirits or regular people with colors around them. The names aren't clever anymore like in the older sets. The new names are like Ishi ishi, akki crackshot. What kind of name is that not to mention the picture of the goblin, oh yeah the goblins an asian goblin I forgot!!!!!"
4,Strathwood Mercer Collection Malas Hardwood Side Chair,"I just received the four Strathwood Mercer Collection Malas Hardwood Side Chairs that I ordered. I just finished putting the first one together after many trial and error attempts because the ""how to"" instructions were rather vague. What they do not say, and what one needs to know in order to get the bolt and insert nut to line up, is that the guiding bolt should only go about half way and not all the way up to the end of the hole. Once I figuered this out, things went rather smoothly. It was pretty straightforward once I knew how to line up the nuts and bolts. The chairs are sturdy and look great."
4,Value outweighs design issues,"Well, I own two of the arm chairs. I have to disagree with the last reviewer regarding design and quality, particularly given the price. I use these to supplement some outdoor teak sofas. When on sale, these cost a tenth of the price of comparable teak chairs. I live in the northeast US and left these chairs out all winter, through snow & rain and temperature fluctuations. They did better than the teak. Actually, I had hoped that they would be a fully grey patina by summer, but they retained the stain. As to comfort and proportion, my spouse is 6'3"" and 200 lbs. He fits very comfortably in these chairs. Judge for yourself, as well as the number of positive reviews, but do not be swayed solely by the last reviewer's comments. I have only had these one season, so I cannot comment yet on the longevity vs. teak."
2,not her best,"Big fan of Thatcher but this is such a waste of space it must surely not have been entirely her work. You may be be shocked/peeved to find that this reads more like some kind of bland all-in-one=together Euro socio-economic 101 course than a book by a great leader and statesman on being one (as its title suggests). Even on the econ Thatcher's Neo-Classical soul must have been mugged by some warped Euro-Marxist ghostwriter as she parrots on here how Russia is ""different"" and Japan ""special"", structural rigidities and blah blah blah. Try Thatcher's many memoirs (Downing Street Years)if you want the real Iron Lady."
1,The Usual Dangerous Ideas,"Once again, Margaret Thatcher demonstrates that she has a diminishingly small grip on the modern world. In this book she throws her net a little wider than her previous autobiographical books and subject is no less than the political landscape of the whole world as it enters the 21st century.Of course, she gets it horribly wrong as always. Her lack of understanding would be funny if it wasn't for one thing - some people will still take her seriously.In the UK, even the Conservative Party now see her as an embarassing anachronism. She has promised to stop speaking in public. It's a pity that she doesn't stop peddling this dangerous nonsense in print as well.So buy it and read it by all means, but don't for a second take her seriously."
1,not worth the money,I bought the book because of its title 'statecraft' and of the generally warm reviews here on amazon.com.the book is not about any '-craft'. there is no strategic thinking in the arguments other than some skin-deep self interest and some reflection toward world affairs. I wonder now how she made her judgements when she was the prime minister of britain. I wish the current world leaders are at higher caliber than this. I know it is just wishful thinking.the tone of the writing is boring and obnoxious.The bottom line: i want my money back!
3,Panasonic,"Can't handle too much bass as expected, but still puts out good sound. highs are crisp and mids sound great. I would say these are great speakers if you are looking for a quick fix. Cheap and reliable. I bought some speakers that were 1/4"" too small so I had to install a mounting bracket. That pushed the speaker out too far so the woofer hit the speaker grill. This set was the right size and didn't have the money to buy the ones I wanted. It was a cheap solution to get rid of the rattling caused by the other set I had."
5,Best Book I've Read All Summer!,I can't remember the last time I had such a good time reading a book! I laughed out loud as I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the next turn of events. A definite page turner! I cannot wait for his next book. I hope it is as funny and exciting as this one!
1,Disappointing,"I read a review of this in my local paper and it sounded very good. But I was so disappointed I didn't bother finishing it. A great idea that became totally contrived, unexciting, and predictable with very little character development."
2,Not good,"I have to disagree with everyone on this one. It is a clever idea, but it relies too much on coincidence to drive the narrative, and Colapinto doesn't have the chops of someone like, say, a young Paul Auster, to make you not notice. The female characters are appalingly underdeveloped, and there's also a tendency to unnecessarily namedrop and overexplain that becomes quite frustrating."
4,what find - a well written clever novel,This was an unexpected joy to read. I picked up a copy at a library sale based on nothing but the inner flap. I found this book extremely well written and a joy to read. The clever juxtaposition of the story within a story was both a fun filled romp and excitng tale. I will seek out other novels by this clever and talented author. I highly recommend reading this novel.
5,A perfect literary thriller,"Cal Cunningham is a poor bookstore clerk in Manhattan. He has dreamed many times of becoming the writer of a novel that would send him to the top of the bestsellers list. When ""Almost Like Suicide"", the great novel based on Cal's life is published, it fulfils all his dreams. But is Cal really the author of the book. And what happened to Cal's flatmate Stewart, who died in a bicycle accident, and who had literary aspirations of his own? This literary thriller is wickedly satiric. Plagiarism, deception and blackmail are part of Call's not only planning his second novel , but also his first murder. A thriller as perfect as if it were written by Patricia Highsmith!"
2,"Too much telling, not enough showing","Eh, this left me completely underwhelmed. Mindless braincandy, really. I guess I didn't like Cal enough to forgive him for his sins. It's entertaining, but don't expect it to stick with you once you close the back cover."
5,Great Book!,"Even though there are many great authors out there, most tend to take a similar approach to writing. That is why I enjoyed this book so much. Colapinto writes a first person narration with a very fresh and witty style. It has been a long time since I have read a book where the character was so flawed; and yet despite his numerous imperfections, I really grew to love him, accepting his rationalizations as my own. I would highly recommend this debut book to anyone, especially those who are looking for a great new author!!!"
5,Wonderful flowing book,"What a great read this one is. This author writes a catchy story line which flows beautiful from page to page. It is very witty, and you can't help but have a smile on your face while reading it. I will be watching for more books by this author. This is the first 5 star review I have given. Good job Mr Colapinto!"
5,A real page turner,"Despite having written nothing for several years, Cal Cunningham dreams of writing a novel that will help him hit the big time. But, on the day that he finally finds his inspiration, he discovers that not only does his roommate have literary ambitions of his own, he's already written a novel, a novel that is destined to top the bestseller lists. When a traffic accident proves fatal for his roommate, Cal decides to pass the novel off as his own. After all, it's practically his story anyway. What follows is a thrilling story packed with suspense.This novel is the story of what happens to Cal Cunningham told in his own words. It's a funny, psychological thriller that was difficult to put down and I would recommend it to anyone whether a fan of the genre or just someone with a few aspirations of your own"
5,What a read!,"This book was highly recommended to me and now I know why. What a book! What a story! What a talented and clever author!Colapinto has written a thriller with a heart, and even some humor. This fast-paced book takes Cal from one disaster to another in rapid succession.The reader enters the tawdry life of Cal Cunningham and wonders how this loser will ever make it. He says he is an author but he never writes. And when a windfall lands in his lap, he takes full and dishonest advantage of it, never anticipating the downward spiral into which he has now entered. He manages to fully justify what he has done and never foresees the possible consequences of his deception. And just when you think things cannot possibly get worse....they do!This book was impossible to put down...I read it into the wee hours of the morning. I really admire Colapinto's clever approach to this story and the ""slant"" that he used."
2,"Sophisticated idea, mediocre execution","Sophisticated idea; mediocre execution. Everything is overstated and hammered home and the novel thus loses the promised elegance of the idea and becomes simply another trite thriller. But maybe that was Colapinto's aim? Whole idioms are set up nicely - the idea of a modern rural paradise being destroyed by an Apple Notebook is both funny and clever, but Colapinto overdraws this to the point where he seems to be condescending to the reader's intelligence and attention span (which he does throughout). And by the way, just because the thing that is stolen is a book does not make it a `literary' thriller."
3,False dawn,"Up until Cal Cunningham secures the huge advance for his stolen manuscript and the literary lunches begin this book is fresh, funny and engaging - it promises great things. The possibilities of a famous writer hiding a terrible secret are fabulous - alas Patricia Highsmith this isnt. From the New Halcyon days onwards it reads like another writer really has stolen THIS manuscript and finished it because it becomes another 'Husband blackmailed - God dont tell the wife' - type of potboiler. Such a waste because Mr Colapinto has a comic ear and Cal promised so much more. A holiday read - no more."
5,LOVE THE PRODUCT.,"Love it. I drink it every day. It's a tad sweet, but I add lemon juice to it, which tones down the sweetness."
4,Arrived on time as expected.,"This is sometimes difficult to find. However, it came nicely wrapped and was just what I expected. This is one of our favorite powder lemonades."
1,grass gel hairball remedy,Unfortunately my cat would have nothing to do with taking it...she tried a lick and refused to try anymore of it:(
1,Icky!,YUCK! this is what my cats said when they RAN away from it!!! It looked like tar and smelt bad. Unappealing.
1,Cat wouldn't go near it,"Cat wouldn't go near, much less taste, this hairball remedy; but she rejected three other similar pastes, so the problem may be with the cat, not the product. The good news is that she loves theFriskies Cat Food Crunchy Hairball Remedy Withtuna, 2.1-Ounce Pouch (Pack of 10), and it seems to have solved a problem that's been going on for 18 months."
5,My cat loves grass gel,"All I have to do is say to my cat ""do you want some grass?"" he comes running. Great product, this is my 2nd order. Would recommend to anyone with a cat."
5,our cats love it !,"Some of our cats our not allowed outside, so we give them this supplement. They love the taste, they eat it, and no more hairballs to clean up from the carpet.Great product, five stars !!"
5,Very clear water as soon as you use this,Love this product for my african dwarf frog Ernie. You can see the water become clear just as soon as you drop this stuff in. That's some powerful drugs frogs are allowed!
2,Not for me,"I can't imagine why Reebok thought this concept would be good. First of all they took different pieces from different tapings of workouts and pieced them together. Of course you would get your heart rate up, enjoying the current workout then they would change it. I hated that. And worse of all they would pick up when everyone is just standing around waiting for her to explain what they are about to do. How annoying! The only part I actually enjoyed was the second session but of course that didn't last long!"
1,Pass on this one.....,"Gin Miller and Reebok have the best step videos around, but they should not have made this one. It's boring and the constant chatter and laughing between the team annoyed me more than it bored me. Try Reebok's other videos instead -- like the original step workout, the Power step workout, or Aerostep."
4,A STORY WORTH TELLING,The largely forgotten stories of the violent union conflicts in the Carolinas are the heart of this debut novel and make it well worth the reading. Kudos to Marlette for the wonderful telling.
2,Amateur Hour,"Heard the author at a book festival recently and was intrigued to see if he was as good on paper as he was on his feet. He was not. The book was sloppily written, with an exasperating back and forth timeline that left both narratives feeling thin and underdeveloped. Hopefully his next try will be better."
2,The Bridge disappoints,"This book started out well, exploring the themes of dysfunctional families (and aren't they all), but I was truly disappointed that Marlette soon descended into trite plot devices and ended up wrapping everything in a pretty package. Family relationships rarely, if ever, work out as neatly as they did in this book, and I felt Marlette should have applied the same razor-sharp truth in this book as he uses in his cartoons.And why in the Sam Hill was the part about the escaped convict put in there? It was so jarringly out of place, I couldn't believe my eyes. It served no purpose other than to introduce some gratuitous violence.One reason why I was drawn to this book was Marlette's opening remark about his paternal grandmother being a piece of work. So was mine. If only Marlette had stuck to having his character examine his prickly relationship with his grandmother and not tried to pretty it up.What a letdown this book was, and what a shame."
5,Ready for the next book,"Marlette's lyrical prose, written with the same brilliant insight he pours into his cartoons, gave me the most enjoyable read I've had in a very long time. Marlette has the ability to draw his characters so finely, regardless of age and gender, it's as if he has inhabited all of them. Forget this ""southern writer"" stuff I see attached to any writer south of Jersey. Why limit his scope? I hope his next book takes us back to New York, where we can use more of his wicked humor. His New York dinner scene is hilarious."
3,Publisher's Weekly Has It Right,"This is a good book, an engaging book, but far from a great book, and I most certainly hope the South can do better than this. (Can I believe someone said this was the best since ""Look Homeward, Angel""?) Nonetheless, I read it straight through, primarily because of the tale of mill life and union strife. If Marlette had trusted that story and stuck with it, it certainly would have been much more gripping. Instead, he seems to have felt he had to give a little frosting with a roman a clef about his personal world. Frankly, that ""frosting"" was just so much melodrama. Read it for its insight into mill life, a gripping slice of social history."
1,BURNING BRIDGES,"I like the cartoon, KUDZU, by Doug Marlette, but was deeply disappointed in his first novel, THE BRIDGE. The story of Pick Cantrell's journey to self-knowledge is littered with characters too dim or cartoonish to take seriously, much less care about. Pick, himself, errs on the sociopathic, and seems to deserve the contempt heaped upon him by his adversaries. It's as if the author was searching for a platform to air his numerous grievances, and I feel as if I was hoodwinked into complicity by the over-generous cover blurbs. What parades as truth reads more like the sputtering complaints of a guy at odds with himself and the world. There are far better books out there, and despite the dubious recommendation of Marlette's self-proclaimed ""blood brother"" Pat Conroy, this is not the best book to come out of the South since ""Look Homeward, Angel"". ""God's Little Acre"" might be a better baseline."
3,"Excellent, while it lasted","Well, all things being equal, when this card worked it was freakin amazing. However, I'm just over a year into it and it's about dead. Screen is so bad it's impossible to see anything. I had to change back to my 128MB card. I'm not a 'power gamer', haven't overclocked, haven't had any other PC problems... this card just decided to go on me, leaving me with a less than optimal video situation."
3,High Yield images but not good for starters,"I finished a 3 week rads rotation and was pretty disappointed in this book. The biggest downfall is that it doesn't give any information on how to read a study (films, CT, MRI, U/S) in a step-wise fashion. This book quickly dives into the most commonly seen disorders/studies that you may face on step-2. If you're looking for a quick review of HY topics for the boards then this book is pretty good. If you're looking for a book on how to actually interpret a study then this book is of little value. For that I'd recommend checking out Squire's from your med-library and go through the needed chapters."
3,well recorded with songs missing,"First the good news: This set is well recorded, that is, the digital remastering makes the tunes sound quite warm and ""tubey"" like the original Rockabilly vacuum tube recordings. Full of energy, Enjoyable for what's there.Then the bad news, there are a number of the most famous Sun recording which are missing from the set, which contains a lot of the lesser recordings and the versions not included on the final release.I have a ""The Sun Story"" from ""Rhino"". Missing from this recording is Warren Smith's classic ""Ubangi Stomp"", the songs that started Elvis' career ""Its' All Right Mama"", & ""Good Rocking Tonight"" , Roy Orbison's ""Devil Doll"" & ""Ooby Dooby"", Bill Riley's ""Red hot"", Carl Perkins ""Honey Don't"" that inspired the Beatles, Johnny Cash' ""Fulsom Prison Blues"", etc.Don't think of this as the complete compendium of Sun Records, and think of it as a well-recorded adjunct to that much more essential CD by Rhino."
5,Doom Board Game,"Cool Game, even better with expansion set, which has new weapons and two new modes 1: capture the flag and 2: deathmatch."
1,DO NOT buy if you want a serious version of this topic.,"I am here to warn you that this book is nothing more than a parody of the things that typically happen within an organization. I was looking for something constructive to use and perhaps buy as gifts for others I know whom are also graduating. This book has proven to be a waste of time for me now. Perhaps when I have lived the life of business for a few years, then I can come back to this book and appreciate its' humor, but now is certainly not that time.The book I wound up with was recommended by my dean and it is called, ""Secrets to Winning at Office Politics : How to Achieve Your Goals and Increase Success"". It is definitely the book I was looking for. It is serious and has a great way of relating the topics to the uninitiated. Even if none of the topics within it's pages come true, at least I am in the right frame of mind to be able to realize and absorb whatever does come."
5,Sleek and elegant,"I really like this necklace. I have some friends that are really into stone jewelry compliment me on this item. I was looking for a piece of jade that wasn't outrageously carved, but was also small enough that I could wear casually (this one is about 2"").The horn has just enough curve to it's visually obvious, but doesn't irritate the skin.I really like the base as it is not only functional, but gives just enough flavor so it's modest, but more than just a 'pretty rock on a string'.The chain is also sturdier than I expected, which goes quite well with the pendant."
3,Cello is an instrument of many words...,"Dont take my rating all too seriously. I dont have a good eye for rating things on a scale (as my statistics teacher tells me) but i know a good piece when i smell one... or is it when i hear one? i guess will never know, but all i have to say is that tchaikovsky wrote one of the greatest pieces of cello music out there, next to haydn, bach, beethoven, etc. variations on a roccoco theme is a wonderful piece of music for the aspiring cellist, seeing that i am one and know many more. =)"
1,End of the Line,"Why would a Wonderful Lady like Dip be forced to write another cookbook?Her first book was a great culinary hit, at last count I had bought 14 as gifts. This cookbook just flew off the bookstore shelves! Then probably forced by a publisher to push for another seller, Dip wrote her Family Cookbook. It was a huge disappointment, giving readers recipes that could be found anywhere in the USA, and not her beloved North Carolina. Really do we need another fruited jello for desert? No thanks, Mama, I'm full!"
3,TRY MOMMA DIP KITCHEN COOKBOOK,"I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED IN THE FAMILY COOKBOOK ,I WAS EXPECTING GREAT RECIPES LIKE HER OTHER BOOK MAMA DIP KITCHEN IT WAS FOOD REAL CAROLINA PEOPLE COOKED."
5,mama dip's second amazing cookbook,"this second cookbook is just as wonderful as the first. i am a fan and even had the opportunity to eat in her wonderful restaurant and meet this gifted cook. the recipes are simple and delicious. my entire family loves each one (my kids are 9 and 5, so that really says something). i believe this one will become as stained and dog-eared as the first. enjoy!"
5,"""EXCELLENT""",Excellent as every recipe mama dip has provided for us. love her cookbooks and her recipes.
4,"After the 3rd time I wanted a recipe, I finally bought my own.",The book is a culmination of a lifelong of hardwork and serving others. I was glad to pay homeage to Mama Council for sharing her exprience at a reasonable price. I would have loved photos of the finish product which is why there were only 4 stars.
4,Excellant,"I enjoyed the book emnincely. It brought back great childhood memories that I could relate to the author, from growing up in the south."
3,Strong but Broke the first time out of the box,"We still use the two broken pieces on the fridge. We have other sizes that have never tried to break. I think that this one, being so thin, was just more fragile. Oh well."
3,try sending the right magnets next time,"instead of getting what i ordered they sent me N42 1"" x 1/4"" x 1/8"" Block not what i ordered but they will suffice. Next time i hope they can send the right magnets."
2,Disappointed,"This could have been really beautiful. From a technical viewpoint, however, it is extremely disapointing. First, it is only 16 minutes long. Next, the transitions are quick and jerky. If the idea is to relax, at the very least the transitions should be smooth fades. A poorly executed product!"
4,Great for nursing moms--and nursing baby behinds,"I had a hard time finding a diaper cream that didn't make my daughter's behind red and itchy. Went through all the brands--desitin, boudreaux, triple paste, aveeno, balmex, even a brand made with goats milk--and none of them got rid of the angry red rash. One of my baby books had a side note that the stuff used for cracked nipples could be used as an (expensive) option for diapering. And it works!! If only this came in a larger size--2 oz goes pretty fast."
5,great for chapped lips,"read online that this product helps with chapped lips. after using everything on the market i tried this product. it really does work. they are not completely healed but so much better than what they were. It is a little tough to get out, but since I only need a little at a time did not bother me. I actually had someone compliment me on my lipgloss the other day, lol, she got a good laugh whenever I told her what it was..hey it works and looks great..works for me!"
5,If your going to breastfeed- YOU NEED THIS!,This stuff is truly a lifesaver! I am a first time Mom and Love breastfeeding but I could not live without this stuff! Get a few to help you get started. It really helps make things more comfertable and enjoyable for you and your baby.
5,A must for breastfeeding mothers,I am a first time mother of a seven month old baby girl. Breast feeding was so wonderful thanks to this product. It protects by creating a barrier on the breast to reduce the wear and tear that is so common. I loved it and recommend it to all new breast feeding moms.
3,Buyer beware!,"I'm sure this is an excellent product. It is the only cream endorsed by the Le Leche League. I used it religiously when I was at the hospital after I had my son for my sore and cracked nipples. I was a confused when my diligent efforts didn't produce healing. I talked to the nurse about it. She observed my breastfeeding techniques multiple times stating that I was doing everything correctly. Then she asked me an interesting question,""Are you allergic to wool?"" Yes I am! This product contains lanolin, a product of wool. For most, it works wonders healing sore nipples; however, the more I put on, the worse I got. So, avoid the blisters on the nipples by skipping this product if you're allergic to wool!"
5,"Get it, Get it, Get it, Get it!","Did I mention you should get it?This product can be used before birth to condition the nipples and after birth to relieve sore nipples. Just apply a little after each nursing session and I guarantee it will make the pain a little more bearable! I am still nursing a 13 month old so believe me I know!I give this to all breastfeeding mothers at their babyshowers along with some of my other ""calling card"" items and I have received so many praises.If you plan on breastfeeding please buy it, your breasts will thank you."
1,Don't waste your money,This product is very sticky and messy. It did not help me. I used the gerber balm and within a day it helped my nipples feel all better. It also costs less and is not messy at all.
5,Take this to the hospital with you!,"I got a sample of this at the hospital when my daughter was born, and it made breastfeeding so much easier! It can be a very painful process during the first couple of weeks, and this cream helps immensely! I put it on after each feeding and any other time my nipples were sore for at least a month. I always felt better right away. I'm not sure I would have stuck with breastfeeding without this product. Take it with you to the hospital, just in case the hospital doesn't have any. It's worth every penny!"
5,a must-have,"If you are breastfeeding, you MUST get this cream. Actually, any lanolin cream will work. The first 3 weeks of breastfeeding is the hard part. This cream relieves the pain and burn. It was the only way for me to get over that hump and continue to nurse my daughter."
1,Goopy and useless,"This stuff is kind of like maple syrup and kind of like diaper creme, and about as useful as either of them would be. I use the Gerber Stick instead and it's 1000 times better. Lansinoh never did anything for me (and I tried it for 2 weeks) and to top that off, it had the added perk of actually waterproofing my nursing pads. So not only was I sore already, and not getting the relief I wanted from the creme, but then I had milk against my nipples all the time because the pads couldn't absorb it. Terrible product and I think without La Leche pushing it it would be off the market by now."
1,359909 Wilson Ant adapter,This adapter does not fit on the sprint HTC TOUCH as stated on the wilson Web site
1,Did not work,Lenmar generally makes good batteries but this one is disappointing. My x40 refuse to charge it. Give it one star for the easy return process from Amazon.
3,Nice but hardly definitive,"Nice collection of big band and easy listening standards, though some are taken from scratchy masters - V-Discs and other Armed Forces Radio sources, I suspect. And, while we're at it, a number of these tracks were cut long after ""the war years."" I mean, Dusty Springfield, Rod McKuen, Liberace? What war are we talking about, exactly? Anyway, the highlights include renditions by Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, and other giants of the swing era. The Louis Armstrong cut, by the way, is a recitation sans music."
5,A CLASSIC MUST FOR ANY METAL FAN,A CLASSIC METAL MUST FOR ANY TRUE FAN OF TOURNIQUET.IF YOU'RE NEW TO THEM GET THIS CLASSIC CD ALONG WITH STOP THE BLEEDING
4,In the beginning,"It started out a bit different than what i expected,but immediately got to the point and kept me spell bound throughout the rest of the book and series. I finished all six books in six days. i love to read."
2,Unimpressed,"I read this title expecting amazing good fun as I am a Zahn fan from Star Wars spins. I found myself caring little for the dragon, the boy, the plot. Everything seemed an unwanted surprise from the boy/dragon banter which I thought I would love to the action sequences. Just disappointed I guess."
4,Music Stand,"K&M Music Stand is light-weight and collapsable. However, it is a little tricky to unfold and can be easily bent out of shape, if you do not unfold it properly. I got around the problem by labeling with an indelible marker which arms go up and which go down in the setting up process."
5,Inspirational Yet Practical,"The Audio version is really precious. You can detect in Thich Nhat Hanh's voice that he is truly In The Present Moment as he walks you through practice exercises of appreciating the preciousness of each moment. I especially appreciated the tips on incorporating Zen techniques into our technological world in such ways as ""telephone meditation"". Simply wonderful!"
2,Looking for more.....,"I've seen many of Sheila's works in magazines so I anxiously bought the book for what I thought would be a more comprehensive analysis, interpretation and implimentation of her style. Instead I found myself reading thoughts and views but no real process to achieving the style.As an apprentice and in the process of implementing what I have learned in my own home, I would not recommend this book as a tool for learning more for understanding a person's views."
2,Boring...,"Is this really a designer? I found this book completely lacking in interest with nothing inspiring or innovative. One humdrum and boring room after another. Quite plainly... ""plain""! These rooms do not breath with any real ""life"" at least not for me."
3,Hooray for the public library!,"There are a lot of mixed reviews for this book, so I am hesitant to purchase it at this time, and I haven't yet read it, so will just give it *** because I like Sheila Bridges on TV. I checked my county library system onlne site and was able to order it to be delivered to my nearby branch library. I must confess to doing this a lot. I read customer reviews on Amazon, then request the book from the library.I do order books and other items from Amazon at various times during the year, so I don't feel like I am using them just for book reviews. : )"
2,Meh,A few inspiring photos. But many just seem dated now. Most of the advice is valid but only useful to design newbies. Worth checking out from the library but certainly not buying.
1,If you like picture only!,This is the book of one time life encounter! The kind of book on puppy every body like and every body forgot tomorrow.
2,So-so book on a great event,"The book is OK, but concentrates far too much effort on just a few pilots/teams. The author repeats his text several times throughout the book, and while trying to come across as way too cool, he just sounds like an obnoxious idiot. Reno deserves better."
4,Fantastic Umbrella,Want the best get this one. Its huge. I used it in a very windy storm and it worked perfectly.
1,This sucks!,"I bought it for my bf and it broke in the first time we tried to use it!!! So frustrating! I am trying to get it fix now... Let see how it goes, but regard of the results now I have to go throughout the hassle of paying for shipping and the embarrassment of an useless gift!!"
1,This product is a total failure,The umbrella failed to stay open after 2 times of previous use. Amazon had replaced it.The second umbrella has failed too after a few times. Unfortunately the return period had expired.
4,Well worth reading,"This book is kind of poorly organized, but it visits the events which are so vividly related in Richard Rhodes' classic The Making of the Atomic Bomb. Powers concludes that Heisenberg did not want to make a bomb for Hitler, and did not want to state so too plainly after the war. The thesis is well-supported and I accept it. This is a book well worth reading, tho not as good as Richard Rhodes' book, which well deserved the Pulitzer Prize it won in 1988."
3,"Well, not exactly a courageous investigation, to be sure","Thomas Powers tends to look at things from a patriarchal and certainly white male perspective, so perhaps that is one of the things wrong with this book. This book will not convict or vindicate Heisenberg, and is rather bland on the issue of his perseverance, successes and failures. Obviously some scientists working under ""Enlightenment"" illusions seem to regard considerations of the safety and well-being of others some sort of hindrance to their work. Powers is perhaps most infamous for his offensive and ludicrous generalizations about Native Americans in the New York Review of Books; he makes an implausible claim that he believes that books should 'shake people out of themselves', something that he should attempt to do with himself. As a feminist, I'm deeply troubled by Heisenberg's War; it demonstrates an unusally limited perspective."
5,Congratulations........,"you have scrolled far enuff to find a real gem of a deal. Deep Purple's first three albums remastered at a rediculously low price. While the remasters are not stellar they are average and certainly better than the vinyl I have been listening to for years. Thanx to the previous reviewer who answered my e-mail re: detials of the remasters. These cds are excellent listening but can hardly be classified as early metal, more prog rock, but are an added collection to one's cd library. The added bonus tracks are not that essential and to be quite honest I will probably burn coppies of these three cds minus the added tracks.No regrets here for this purchase."
4,For those who like cards or strategy,"I found this game fairly easy to master. Once you have a core deck it was easy to change a few cards (if you want) to dominate this game. I didn't collect all the cards and didn't feel like I needed to. Some of the battles take hours, which could be a problem."
4,Amazing game if you're the type of person to like it.,"After having played the PS2 version, I was extremely excited when I found out that they were going to make one for the 360. It's basically the same game with some added features, and that's EXACTLY what I would have wanted.Some people may find it slow-paced. Think of this as a board/card game, not a video game.Some people may find the voiceovers/plot horrible. This is not a game you play for the story, but for the pure gameplay alone.Some people may find the graphics subpar. This is not a game you play for the shininess.If you can get past that stuff, you have a serious gem on your hands with Culdcept Saga."
5,My 2 cents...,"I went to the store to pick up a different game and this one happened to catch my eye. After reading the description, I was intrigued. Well, it surpassed all expectations. I really enjoy it.Things I like:1) The collectible card part (my kids and I all have different cards and the randomness of getting them is kinda neat).2) The hybrid card/board game (don't even mind the luck factor-although it can be annoying rolling 3 ones in a row while the other players are lapping the board.3) The learner curve was not to steep.4) It's just fun.Things I don't like:1) Holy Word Zero (stupid card-especially when your oppenent has it as an ability on a short map...lol)You'll see what I'm talking about when it's played on you.Truthfully, there is nothing I have ran into that I haven't liked, but I have only invested about 15-20 hours so far. My kids (7 and 10) like it too."
2,not so well buit,"the bike keep having problems right away, from brakes, brake pads, tires, peddle, and sitand more, not recomaned"
5,Great knives at a reasonabl price,These are the first proper knives I have ever purchased and I am quite happy with them. Comes with a sharpener too!
3,Okay for the price,"So far I haven't been impressed with these. They are unusually lightweight, but sleek-looking. Compared to the knives I've been looking at (for about a year now) the price is what keeps them on my counter. I agree with one other reviewer - my knives also have ""stains"" on them only after using them for about three weeks. They look discolored in places and look like they are starting rust. How is that possible with stainless steel?"
1,EXTREMELY disappointed,"I've owned a set of Chicago Cutlery for 16 years (a wedding gift). They have served us very well. I decided the set needed replacing, not because the blades are bad, but because the wooden handles have dulled, and a couple have cracked. I purchased this set of Forum knives at Walmart, thinking I got a great deal. I mean, it's Chicago Cutlery. They make (made) great knives. They were sharp and beautiful out of the box. But now, it's only been two weeks, and the large chopping knife got some kind of foggy looking stains on it, and rust marks. One of the steak knives did also. I used soft scrub and even steel wool to try to buff it out, to no avail. Please note: I NEVER wash my knives in the dishwasher, always by hand. Needless to say, I'm returning them today and looking for a replacement brand. Shame on Chicago Cutlery!"
3,Hmm...,"Not quite the best quality control. One knife had a burr on it, another was hardly sharpened. Disappointing. But they are single forged, no cheap wood riveted to wear out. Another disappointment is the weight of the knives. They are incredibly, unnaturally, lightweight. Otherwise, ergonomics are great, styling is pleasant, sharpness and cut is fair to good, and presentation in block is good."
5,good value for a good product,I bought this for my son for his first apartment after graduating college. He loves it. He says that the knives are great! They're very sharp and he likes the way they look and the feel in his hands. He's completely satisfied and is glad I got them for him.
4,Worth the Money,This a great knife set. I was a little warry of buying a knife set online. But they have a user friendly handle and are nicely sharpened. Great selection of kinfes as well. Could by 10 times as much and not get range of tools. Also look good on the counter. Thinking of get a set for my parent this christmas.
5,Excellent Knives,"This set of knives is very sharp, good looking, and easy to clean. I've had recent guests who complimented me on having such a good set of knives."
3,not as sharp as I'd hoped.,"I was the owner of the worst knives it the world. So I finally decided to purchase some. A friend recommended Chicago Cutlery knives. They are better than what I used to have and I haven't sharpened them yet, but I still thought they'd be sharper out of the box. The smallest knife is especially dull, I feel like I am pulling it through strawberries."
1,"Really sucks, very noisy, not in good quality","I bought a brand new, besides the big noise, it just worked 1 day, and I saw the smoke out the motor"
2,I've used medela for years and quality went down the drain.,"I have 3 kiddos, my oldest just turned 6. I honestly loved the medela brand and would have never considered buying anything else until now. I recently purchased this model and didn't even get 3 months use out of it until suction went bad then motor went out (i purchased different tubing and everything with no success). You can tell in recent years it's now cheaply made. Now that the brand quality went down I just ordered a new pump called simplisse. It's not like your typical pump. It doesn't pull on your nipples, instead it acts more like a baby's mouth. Rather than the hard shields it's soft and wraps around your breast like a baby would do. I've done a lot of research on a new pump and I highly recommend it. Don't go with medela unless you're willing to pay for the hospital grade. They care more now about quantity rather than quality. Which is sad because I was a huge fan of their pumps."
3,Where's the suction?,"I was very disappointed in this pump. The faceplate popped off every time I used it and I ended up having to pump with my foot on it to make it work. I didn't think the ""let down"" feature was even needed - a regular electric pump accomplishes the same thing. Then you needed to hit the button once let down begins and you have no available hands to do that with. Annoying! I say skip this pump and get the Pump In Style in the backpack. Much better and save yourself $40 while you're at it."
5,One year later and still nursing!,"I received my Pump in Style Advanced as a shower gift. I started using it in December of 2004 to build my freezer stash. It was easy and comfortable to use. I returned to work full-time in January 2005. Using this pump, I was able to get enough milk to exclusively breastfeed my son until he was 6 months old, and when I introuduced cow's milk (at one year), I had never needed to give him formula. I'm still using this pump every day at work, and it hasn't given me a minute's worth of trouble.The only negative thing I have to say about the Pump in Style Advanced is that my son didn't like the nipples that went with the bottles that came with the pump. Therefore, I use those bottles for pumping and storage, and I transfer the milk into Avent bottles before feeding my son."
2,Pump motor failed quickly.,"I purchased this pump when it first came out. I used it to pump at work, while breastfeeding my child at home.I liked the features, the freezer bag and the arrangement of the pump and parts. While the pump was working, it worked well.The pump stopped working correctly after about 3 months of use. It only pumps now on the strongest setting, which I find quite painful to use on a regular basis.I will be replacing this pump with something else, now that my second child has been born."
1,Pump in Style Advanced,"I had such a bad experience with this product that I want to warn others about it, especially since it has so many great reviews on this site. I had been using a hospital-grade pump (the Medela Classic) for 4 months before buying this product. With the Classic, I was pumping 6-8 ounces in 10 minutes. When I tried switching to the Pump in Style, I got only about 4 ounces even after 15 minutes of pumping. After one week and several conversations with a lactation consultant, I gave up with sore breasts and a decreased milk supply. This pump IS NOT great for everyone, and I think it is an overpriced piece of junk. I know it is great for some women, but it doesn't work for everyone."
2,Didn't care for this pump,"I was using the Medela Pump in Style for about a month and grew tired of it. It hurt, it was LOUD, and then I found out that it's not a closed system, meaning that the hoses can build up condensation that can mildew and contaminate the milk I was pumping! Eew! I eventually bought an Avent Isis Duo and love it. The good hing about this pump is that you can use a pumping bra and the containers do not contain BPA. I never got comfortable with the suction levels. I had to replace the faceplate because it kept popping off. Doesn't seem to be designed very well."
3,Good Pump. Terrible Customer Support.,"I have had a Pump In Style Advanced for approximately 6 months. I've used it daily since returning to work and have generally been happy with it. Recently, the face plate of the pump broke such that I cannot use the pump. I called Medela customer service and was told that they only have a 90 day warranty. Eventually the rep agreed to provide a replacement faceplate but told me I would have to pay for expedited shipping. After I asked to talk to a supervisor, the rep eventually offered to provide expedited shipping without charge. Even with expedited shipping, I was unable to pump for a day. If I had it to do again, I would rent a hospital pump - they provide loaners and replacements same day. Medela makes you jump through hoops to get the pump fixed even when the pump breaks through no fault of your own."
4,A life saver!,"This is the closest I could find on amazon to the pump I've used. I used two different medela pump in style breast pumps for two different children and have had pretty decent results.The one I'm using now has a different strap than pictured but I've used it every day 6-8 times a day for 5 months and its still working perfectly. The bag is dirty and the seems have busted but the motor is still running. Both bags were the same un-appealing material, and aren't overly sturdy.Overall, I've had the best luck with this breast pump. I would recommend it to anyone who has to supplement and pump, or anyone who needs to go back to work etc. If there is any reason you need to pump on a regular basis this is a good worthwhile investment.If I hadn't had these pumps I'm not sure I'd have been able to give my children milk as long as I did/have. Its a life saver to not have to pump one breast at a time, or do it manually."
5,exclusive pumping,"Although expensive, it is a great product. I have been exclusively pumping for 4 months now, pumping about 48 ounces a day, which I could not achieve with a Dr. Browns manual pump. I pump 5 times a day for aprox. 20 minutes. The pump and accessories are easy to clean and use."
5,Works great,The Advanced pump works just as well as the Symphony pump that we used in the Hospital. I would definitely recommend this product. It is very helpful.
5,Great for working mothers,"And also great with mothers who want to maintain and increase milk supply. The set up, clean up and breakdown takes an extra 2-3 minutes but you can get a plentiful pumping session in 10 minutes."
5,BEST Breast Pump on the Market !!!,"I have used several breast pumps, and I finally found the one that REALLY works. It costs more, but the price of formula is so high, this breast pump will pay for itself in about a month. This breast pump is a DREAM Come True !! Comfortable, quick, effecient !!!I would also like to share a money saving idea... You can save money on Diapers, Formula, wipes and baby supplies at 1-800-Diapers on the internet. FREE Shipping, no sales tax, great prices !! Use Referral CODE: BRST3227 to SAVE $2.00 off your first order !! This code does NOT expire."
5,excellent pump,I bought this pump after having an horrible experince with the first years natural comfort breast pump. This pump has worked for me everytime I used it (the first years did not). Pumping does not take a long time and I know it will last me a long time. I think it was well worth the money( I researched other places on the web that sell it. I found a site that sold it for $80.00 cheaper and with free shippping). Happy pumping.
5,Life saver!,"I have this pump & it is heaven sent! My daughter was airlifted to a hospital an hour away after she was born & this pump saved me! It was comfortable to use, convienent to have & has a great little ice chest area. I stayed at the Ronald McDonald House for a while & it was great to have in the middle of the night - all I had tro do was oump & put the milk a3way right there. In the morning the milk was cold & I would bring it over. The bad is stylish & has room for everything you need."
5,LOVE the PIS Advanced and It's Worth the Extra Money!,The Pump in Style Advanced is the BEST pump out there! I have the shoulder bag version and it's worth every penny. The pump itself works great and is very efficiant and quick. The bag is roomy and I keep all of my supplies for pumping away from home in it. The let down feature is nice and I find it helps speed things up. Medela PIS is the best!
3,"Intuit, always thinking of new ways to charge you more.","Intuit has done it again with quickbooks 2003. I just noticed that one of the new features is that you can print W-2s on blank paper. When you try to do this operation you are told that you need to subscribe to their payroll service $$$. Intuit has got to be the worst example of [messing with]their customers I've ever seen. Pretty good program, lousy company. Try other programs before you settle on Quickbooks and get locked in."
2,Would agree with the Nayes!~,"Quickbook supports lacks for an average user. We have been using Quickbooks since 1997 and have stopped at 2001. This is due to, among other things...charges for a software problem... charges and long-waits, and more charges. Anyway, if you know accounting, such as an advisor, sure one would use Quickbooks, but ever since these products became some how intertwined with Microsoft, the service and quality have not been the same... Also, don't try to export data, this function is very poor! Can anyone recommend another product. WE are a growing company and do not want to deal with Intuit's surprises with the tax tables. What has gotten into them? Is this maybe the greed state of a small monopoly on accounting programs? Go figure!"
3,PRIOR EDITION,"I would like to upgrade to QB Pro 2003. However, I am very concerned. I am now running QB Pro 2002. In 9/2002, I upgraded QB Pro 2002. My program never worked right after the upgrade. I run ME and the error message always said ""Systems Resources Low......"". I deleted the upgraded program and reinstalled the old program. Everything worked find. Tech support cost quite bit but were of little help.I keep my firm's books using QB but am leary about upgrading to QB Pro 2003. I may have to buy the full version to be safe."
1,Waste of money.,"I tried QuickBooks Pro 2003, and it is very hard to work with. I have a good knowledge of accounting and finance, but unfortunately my accounting background did not help. Waste of money.I have to look for something else. Also, it performs very poor in a multi-user environment. thanks."
1,Read ALL of the fine print,"After being forced to upgrade to 2003 because they don't support earlier verions for payroll tax tables, and after I registered the man assured me that ""everything was good to go"" (that is if you don't plan on doing payroll with Quickbooks)!! I come to find out that payroll isn't provided until you buy the $ 169.00 subscription to the tax tables for the new version. I guess I'm wondering why you would buy Quickbooks if you don't do payroll???If your main bookeeping computer isn't hooked to the internet, you are in for a little surprise because it seems that it is impossible to receive the update on one network computer and get it moved to the other one without an act of congress. Of course I won't even mention what kind of tech support I didn't receive. When I finally got connected to a live person it seems like my problem was always handled by another tech dept. As of this writing I'm still waiting to get my problem resolved and I'm still on hold..."
2,Exceptionally Poor Product,"I have owned the ""Pro"" version of this product for all of two weeks. If I can still get a refund, I will. Here are my list of problems: The application crashes often in my windows XP environment. I have 40 other applications on my machine and not one of them has crashed. Quickbooks touts that it is compatible with ACT! and Outlook, but only with older versions of either applications. I went to install the Timer and while it installed on my machine fine, I was amazed to find that the only way to make copies of the Timer for legal distribution was on a floppy. I don't have a floppy on my machine. I have never needed one before Quickbooks 2003. I am willing to pay for support on a ""pay-as-you-go"" basis, but then I expect such service to be 24-7 not 6-6/M-F. This application is going out of date, Quick. I am not impressed. (Also, Kathy Levin's 'The Offical Guide' has less value than the enclosed manual. Skip this, too)"
1,Alternative to QuickBooks,"As a previous user of QuickBooks I have to say that the product is decent, but it has gotten way too expensive, and their customer service has declined over the years, and you really shouldn't have to pay to get your product up and running. The good news is that there are other alternatives that are less expensive, offer free training and have better customer service. Check out Simply Accounting, it's about a third of the price, has been reviewed and actually beat QuickBooks and for those of you that may speak Spanish it is actually fully bilingual. Their website is www.simplyaccounting.com"
1,Misleading Packaging and Information,"After using QBpro 2002 for two years, I opted to upgrade to 2004 since it would be updated and would, I assumed, contain the new 2004 federal tax tables which I would need in doing the payroll. Imagine my surprise when setting up my payroll to find that QBPro 2004 does NOT have the 2004 tax tables and for me to down load them it will be an additional $169. Conversation with a company rep explains that it was impossible for them to include the tables as they are still waiting on some states. Since the primary focus is the federal taxes, Income, SS and medicare, I find this unacceptable as SS and Medicare rates have not changed in years and the federal tax has been known for months. I find it unacceptable to pass something off as ""up dated to 2004"" and then not be completely updated. I for one will not be purchasing any Intuit products anytime soon. Since I had opened the product to install it it cannot, of course, be returned."
1,QuickBooks - quickly unsupported,"Support even for the add-ons that require a monthly fee stops after 3 years. Do not think of this as a purchase, think of it as a 3-year lease."
1,Financial planner regrets using QuickBooks,"I've started using QuickBooks several years ago - and have regretted every minute. As a financial planner, I have heavy experience in finance and accounting. Even I find QuickBooks almost indecipherable. I continually recommend that my business clients stay clear of QuickBooks. In fact, starting January 1, 2004, I am ditching QuickBooks in my office in favor of (in my opinion) a much better application."
1,I'd rather deal with Tony Soprano,"I don't have a problem with the way Quickbooks works, but paying [$$] a year for the tax tables is pure (...). When I was forced to upgrade to QB Pro 2003 it at least came with the payroll tax tables for the year. This year if I wanted to upgrade to QB 2005 they wanted [$$] for the upgrade and [$$] additional for the tax tables. Every year they come up with a clever new way to cheat their customers out of their money.Utterly shameless.I've been using QB since 1996 and this is the last year I will use this software."
1,No Choice - upgrade or switch!,"While Intuit had a good thing going, they have gone the way of Microsoft and added bad toys to a good program. Instead of getting better, 2003 has become overloaded for an average business user. The accountants are bound to be happy, as by the time the next version comes out, the average user will require an accountant to utilize the program. Now we are informed, on very short notice, that we HAVE TO UPGRADE TO HAVE PAYROLL SUPPORT! Otherwise Intuit no longer cares about you as a customer. And you'll notice that the price has skyrocketed! And customer support is nil without a large cash infusion into Intuit's pocket. My review: Time is ripe for competitors to step in and steal customers. I'm placing a sell order on my stock...and I will be looking a another accounting package for my needs. I may pay more, but I'll get a better program with REAL customer support."
1,The worst version of QB ever,"I am a former QB advisor but quit when they wanted $1000 a year from me to maintain advisor standing. Every time you blink on this software there is a charge. I manage this software for a number of clients in all aspects of its applications and was forced to QB2003 for payroll updates. Gouging at its worst. This new version is the slowest it has ever been, crashes frequently and even when I email them with lists of complaints and bugs from the many upgrades I have done, they do not respond and downright lie to me. I would switch to an alternative accounting application in a heartbeat. Contempt for their customers seems to be the company mission statement of Intuit and I am actively pursuing an alternative to these parasitic incompetents."
1,Run Away From Intuit,No support. Run away from this company. if you have trouble (and you will) know that they are impossible to reach and won't talk to you without a credit card number. A paper ledger book is better than an Intuit product.
2,Upgrade? No thanks!,"I currently use QB Pro 2000 and was checking into upgrading. After reading the reviews, I have decided not to and perhaps switch to an alternate product. The only ""positive"" review, Ms. Schiff's, was very helpful in my decision not to purchase the upgrade. Ms. Schiff's ""review"" was only a blatant advertisement for her company."
2,Cheap design,"I used to have a training wheel made of steel. I lost it after 20 or so years while it was still as good as new. I expected similar quality here. However:1) steel handle bar is thin. It holds my weight (I am about 140 pounds), but I seriously doubt it will be rigid enough for a 200 pound man.2) wheels are made plastic and don't seem durable at all.3) holes in the wheels don't match the diameters of the bar, there is significant slack. I had to apply plenty of grease in order to make the wheel roll more-or-less smoothly.The bottom line is:you can use it if you are not too heavy, but don't expect it to be very smooth and last very long."
1,Waste of money,"Got this product, used it once. In the middle of a set, the rubber came off the wheel, and the plastic shattered. Great way to spend $10."
4,Works fine,Works fine and supports my 220 lbs just fine. Construction does seem a little cheap. I have seen better models for about the same price.
3,Mildly Interesting,"Not a single song is allowed to play all the way through and there is decidedly too much talking and not very interesting talking at that.Much of the Dylan footage looks as though it was copied from a television (except for the home movies, which were brief). The Leadbelly footage was interesting (if disturbing) as was the Pete Seeger footage.It is basically an illustrated essay, which is fine, but please, at least allow one person to finish a song, maybe?Good at moments, overall disappointing."
4,Interesting Dylan Documentary,"While there isn't a note of Bob Dylan singing in this documentary, it is still worthwhile. It gives a thorough background on what influenced Bob Dylan as he grew into one of the greatest songwriters of all time. Worth the price, for me, was rare footage of Pete Seeger and Leadbelly. The Pete Seeger footage dates from 1955 when he was hauled before the House Un-American Committee (history proved that they were the unamericans, not Pete Seeger). And the Leadbelly clips consist of most of the historic 1935 March of Time newsreel. Most of the musical perfomances by other folks in this DVD are pretty good, too."
3,Great for the price.,"This is a great set of headphones for the price. The sound quality is decent and they are quite comfortable and stay put, would be great for the gym or to go on a run with."
2,Poor Sound Quality,Better off with the earplugs that came with my Sansa MP3. The sound quality is poor and they are not loud enough.
3,Sweet,"I think that this is a nice love story, but not great science fiction. Joan Collins doesn't seem convincing when she says what she thinks the future will be like. It's a ""chick"" episode!"
1,the most overrated Star Trek eposode of all time,I wanted to write a brief review to even things out a bit. I cannot understand why this episode is so popular. I found it quite unremarkable. I can only think that Joan Collins' presence in the line up is the cause of all the fuss. Spock and Kirk spend most of the episode dressed up as 1930s homeless American laborers. Is this really what Star Trek the original series is all about? Is this really 'the best'? I don't think so. I can think of many episodes that were far more enjoyable. The thrust of the story is that peace movements are bad for world peace. Yawn!
1,Fails to deliver.....,"In one word this video is horrible! I felt like I was trapped in a cross between the movie, The Running Man and Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation music video. Furthermore, the voice over is awful, there is NO enthusiasm in it.Pass on this on - trust me you'll be glad you did!"
2,don't judge this book by its cover,"I, too, thought this book would be the penultimate guide to English style. That would only be true however, if one believes English style to be unrelentingly grim, grim, grim. All the photographs (and there were fewer than one might have wished) were of dark interiors and unwelcoming, depressing rooms. Maybe Chippy Irvine could have just explored her husband Keith's work. This book does not represent English style at all, to my mind, despite its misleading cover. Glad I didn't pay full price for it."
2,Did not like the book.,"This book has nothing common with the classical English style if you are looking for it. It has dark, gloomy and boring room photographs. But, it has a useful information in the introduction part as it explains the history and challenges in English decoration style from early periods until now."
5,The best,"I really like this CD. If anybody likes music that they can move to, then they should get this. It keeps you listening for more."
4,hellspawn in a different view,"This TPb is great! as we finally see how angela was born, emerging from 5 tortured souls, the art and history is also great, we even get the chance to see past versions of the hellspawn like the spawn from the age of caligula wearing armor and helmet or the first spawn from the stone age wich was angela's first kill as a heavenly hunter...those two guys are worth alone the book. Also the last history regarding the purgatory was excellent and it shows another heaven embassador wich is very hot and how heaven decides that there is no more use of this place.althought the book is great one question remains why the curse of the spawn was canceled?, anyhow spawn fans would enjoy this book."
2,Tedious Diaries,"Anne Lister's life if done as a biography or fictionalized novel would most likely be quite interesting, but reading 365 pages of her diary entries is not.And its sad, because the woman who edited these diaries spent six years of her life de-coding Ms. Lister's journals.However, the lesbian content is so slight it really is not worth wading through the tedious daily activities of these journals."
3,Packaging,"Bike damaged inside of box (seat and rear reflector). Exterior of box had no sign of damage,but box is much larger than bike which allows the bike to slide back and forth. Rear wheel - tire had to be installed onto rim, rim is already attached to bike frame. Front tire was already installed on rim with air in it, so that only requires mounting the front wheel assembly to the bike frame. Assembly booklet covers different models which makes it harder to follow the assembly and adjustments. All parts will require lubrication - Bike was very squeaky on the suspensions areas. Granddaughter is happy with getting the bike"
1,Gamer in INDY,"I bought this at the store and returned it after 2 days. The battery life is terrible. The controller wouldn't do what you wanted it to do. The jump button wouldn't work if I hit the pause button, the game would end. It is not worth the money, my advise is just get an extension for the regular controller, it works great!!"
2,Intec not Logitech,"Jason J Marandas above, stated that this defective product was from Logitech , but that was a mistake this product is by Intec a 3rd party maker of low quality peripherals for the big 3 game machines. Logitec is Signed to be at correct specs by the game companies and is the only company to carry the seal of approval from these companies."
4,THE BEST!,Where the cord go i dont no but this thang helped me not get any tangles.i love that thang and its torbo button.Oh and not having to change the battery.just recharge it.if you want to keep your battery life longer then turn of the rummble and get a little bit closer to your PS2.I hope that helped.5 stars!(...) says peace out!
1,Allan is getting a little too fuzzy,"I became hooked on instrumentals during my youth in the fifties and sixties. Among my favs were the Ventures, Surfaris, and Davie Allan & Arrows. Allan's guitar work coupled with Mike Curb's compositions was an unbeatable formula for fantastic instrumentals. Two of the very best were ""The Wild Angels"" and ""Devil's Angels"" soundtracks with great instrumentals such as ""Unknown Rider,"" ""Hell Rider,"" and ""Devil's Carnival."" However, I find Allan's latest offerings to be dismal. He uses way too much distortion and seems to lack the enthusiasm of his youth. I suggest the aforementioned soundtracks as a way better buy."
2,More bad than good,"I picked up this book to get up to speed in modeling in Max 4. I've done production work with Max 4 in animation, lighting and rendering, so I can't speak to those chapters, but the modeling is frustrating at best. reference images they use for back plane images are not on the CD and entire steps are skipped over with either the assumption you already have the knowlege (in the FIRST chapter on box modeling?) or just blatent neglict. I have to mirror ""reader from New Jersey""'s feelings...did New Riders edit this, or just shove it out to be the first on the shelf?"
1,Horrid.,"In a word this book is ... This book is nothing more than a waste of both your time and trees, if you are thinking of buying this book don't. What this book is chock full of is errors and don't plan on following the tutorials because you will soon find that you can't as complete steps are missing, not explained or just plain wrong. I really regret having wasted my money on this poor title -- didn't anyone at New Riders bother to edit it?My copy is now being used as a door stop in my office, don't make the same mistake. Avoid buying this book at all costs."
1,"in three words, bad, bad, bad, do not buy this book!","do not waste youe money on this book, it barly touches the most impresive addition to max 4, poly editing/modeling. for beginners this book is too hard (skips the basics) but for advanced its too basic. i just mailed it back to amazon. 3ds max users beware! this is not the book you want, no matter if you are a beginner, or advanced user. LOOK ELSEWARE"
1,Buy another book...,"Tonight for the first time I started studying this book,I'm not new to 3ds max and when I tried to follow chapter 7 by Joseph Yoo I was really confused.What kind of tutorial is that? The teaching methodology was really terrible.The writer has omitted lots of necessary details.You can't follow the steps,because many essential steps have been ignored.You should think and think to predict what is omitted,and this kind of writing without paying attention to the needs of customers,is a waste of time.The successful writers usually consult an expert in methodology,and in this way they can convey their knowledge to the reader with the highest quality.My question is:If you are going to spend a lot of time and effort in writing a book,why don't you try to be the best.My advice for the author is:first test your style in order to see whether it is understandable for some students and then publish it...."
1,Dont waste your money!!,"Thank you for all the people who wrote what I will write right right now. Please DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!, this is the worst book of 3D max I 've ever read. First , is not for beginners neither for intermediate and if it's for advance people, why they should buy it?. The explanations are very bad, they think that you as a 3D modeler should know and be in their heads to know what they are really saying and doing. The jump from one place to another is confusing, they just tell you to look at the picture and do it..nothing else!! what a waste of time trying to smash your head doing what is on the picture with just a comment. If you really want and advice, use the tutorials that come with your copy of MAX. It's a pitty that my mother bought it as a gift and ordered from the USA just to bring it to switzerland for me and receive such a dissapointing book."
3,Not so good,"In my consideration this book is badly written. Why?!Well, the main reason is the fact that it has almost 900 pages and only one solid example of work?! On 900 pages, no way...For example ""The Bible"" learns you from beggining to expert, and it's only one book. I am not any begginer neither and expert, however I consider that if I cannot read this book, who can?But if I would be a begginer y should buy a whole collection of books, one just for understanding the interface, other for basics of modeling, another for starting animation, etc...The filosophy of writting books is to put more information in less content, not to make it so complicated. Even if I am advanced in many things y preffer to buy one book that starts repasing from the beggining..."
1,Not another compilation disk,"Deep Purple is my all-time favorite band but c'mon.... enough's enough! Not ANOTHER compilation, Best Of disks."
5,Tracklisting,Here's the tracklist for this CD:1. When I Was A Child2. Sailors Of The Highway3. Ghetto Baby4. Jitterbug Love5. City Port6. High7. Do Your Thing8. Sunken Rags9. Tell Me10. Black Jack11. Squint Eye Mangle12. Ghetto Baby13. High14. City Port15. Do Your Thing16. Sunken Rags17. Squint Eye Mangle18. Sailors Of The Highway
3,Great tape but too may recovery periods,"The video is pretty intense, but has too many recovery periods in my opinion. The video starts off with a tai chi warm up and cool down that was not appropriate for this video. You really need to get the blood pumping and get a good stretch in your legs before starting the workout. Then it moves into the first aerobic segment. This video alternates aerobic segments w/ the intense move segments - jumps, kicks, squats, lunges, kickboxing, and cross country skiing. After the aerobic circuits, I did some jump-roping moves. In between the toning segments, I did kicks, knee ups, and punches. When I did that, I got a good decent workout. This tape I would classify as an upper-intermediate tape. It is a great tape on those days where you need a good workout, but don't want to deal with complexity."
4,K&M Music Stand,A good music stand for the price put kind of flimsy. The part where the sheet music sits on is a little awkward to open and can cause you to bend part of the frame the wrong way. I probably should have invested a few more dollars for a sturdier stand.
2,Goodness gracious me.,"When these came out they werent too bad, but now they are really dated.They dont seem to have stayed the test of time, they were well recorded but will never become classics. They are good for bringing back memories thats all.I'd rather save me money and spend it on a really nice hot chicken madras with onion bhagi's for starters.Beats fish and chips anytime."
4,"A Bagful of Rare Treasures from ""The Voice""","Fans of Diana Ross and/or The Supremes NEED this CD! Most of these songs have long been out-of-print and are underrated. It's good to FINALLY have the original albums on CD instead of endless rehashings by Motown with like, the same hits over and over with maybe one rare goodie thrown in. Diana Ross sounds AMAZING on these albums and the musical styles explored are diverse. My favorites: the ballad ""Til Johnny Comes"", ""Loving You Is Better Than Ever"", ""Shadows of Society"" (SINGLE-WORTHY), ""Will This Be The Day"", ""The Beginning Of The End"". Her version of ""Hey Jude"" is a wee bit daft however. Still, Diana Ross is one of the most gifted pop singers of the 20th century, and can handle any song handed to her with ease. The icing on the cake with this CD is the FANTASTIC packaging!! You'll see what I mean when your copy arrives in the mail."
5,Not Narrow at All,"The Narrow Road, by Steven Kaye, is a great read for anyone who likes to lose themselves inside the pages of a good fantasy novel. The characters are very well developed for this genre. They're familiar, yet unique. This is particularly true for the Ariel character, the last of the Kwaye. He is a truly majestic hero; dark,flawed yet noble of character. (Just don't make him mad!) His is a dying race and Ariel struggles throughout this narrative to find his true calling in a changing world.If you dream of elves and dwarves, princesses and kings, yet tire of the sameness of the Tolkien series, then The Narrow Road is an excellent choice."
4,vintage McTell,"This is one of several high-quality albums McTell recorded in the early and mid-1970s, and is easy to recommend. First, the songs are all good or better, including four McTell classics: ""Zig Zag Line"" (a wonderful father-and-son piece), ""Run Johnny Run"" (a prison escape song with a great hook and exciting rhythm guitar work by Bert Jansch), ""Let Me Down Easy"" (a bittersweet love song), and ""Maginot Waltz"" (about WWI). Then there are the backing musicians, many of whom are major names in their own right. Finally, the overall atmosphere is friendly and warm, with McTell in good voice. Yes, the price is high, but this is a very good album by a major talent..."
5,Remind your Protestant neighbors who really has the keys to heaven,"So what if the Donation of Constantine was a fake? The Vatican still has the pope, his giant egg-like crown, and the keys to heaven. Commemorate Christ's vicar on earth 6 days a week, and put up the Green Bay Packer flag on Sundays."
4,Perfectly OK for my needs,"I bought this flag for interior display in my room. I found the quality to be better than what I expected from the picture, so I ended up hanging it from my window for an extended period of time. Even after some serious wind and rain, it looks OK (though some water might have stained it). I don't think it's something you would present to the Pope, but it's a nice flag for a good price."
4,"Great flag, but...","The only downside to this is that it took a long time to arrive from when it is ordered. Other than that, the price was unbelievable and the quality excellent."
5,A MUST READ!,"This book has had a huge impact on my life-- so much so, that I have purchased 30 copies for friends and family. Anyone seeking to learn about the spiritual depth of Judaism will find this book hard to put down! If you, like me, have had a hard time finding meaning in Reform or Conservative Judaism, and seek a greater understanding of ""What does it mean to be Jewish"", then you will get a tremendous amount from this book."
4,good for all,"This book gives a hasidic, yet not sectarian view on many aspects of life. Whereas most hasidic books stand still at questions on faith, this book explores the mind in a more philosophical way. The last few chapters can be missed; as the writer is repeating himself to much. Hence the 4 stars in stead of 5."
3,Good info bad pictures.,"This is a good attempt at a sport which there are few and for good reasons...cold water and small surf. I am a Great Lakes Surfer. The pictures killed the book. I have surfed clean head high+ waves that compete with any ocean on Lake Michigan. It is hard to create an interest in a sport where we surf year round, with bad pcitures. I have seen and surfed real ocean like waves here, but was very upset that none of those pictures made it into the book, could be none exsist. Surf does exsist here, and more time is needed to photograph and document the surf. It's complex and you have to WANT to surf, even if the air is 20 and the water is 38 degrees. Maybe next time."
1,Mini book about mini waves,"The only thing smaller than the waves pictured in this book are the pictures of these miniature waves. The cover describes this as a guide to ""Monster waves"", yet where are they? In all the years this area was alledgedly surfed, surely there must be at least one picture of a ""monster"" wave. Nothing here appears larger than typical afternoon wind-chop in the three foot range. I feel sorry for these landlocked wannabees."
5,Your perfect companion!,"I moved to Ohio from the Philippines for work and knew nothing of lake surfing. Getting this book immediately helped me understand and learn what, when, where, and how I should plan my surf trip! Highly recommend the book!"
3,scale,"Am comparing it with a smaller postage scale which I have which I like better. This scale is supposedly on zero but the number constantly moves, instead of remaining on zero as my other one does. As a result, I do not know if the result is accurate. When asked about this, I was told that 'interference' from something electric could cause this with no solution.Then it will remain on point 2 of a ounce or similar number.My other scale which weighs just to five pounds does not do this, it might not be accurte but at least I do not worry about its accuracy."
5,Great item!,Works just the way I need it to! Better then described and arrived way faster than expected. A+ + +
2,Not helpful,"This book is not helpful whatsoever, sorry! For those of you with a 95 Trooper do a search online for the ""Trooper Workshop Manual"""
5,very nice,"My 18 month old son loves taking the caps on and off of these bottles. They are quite sturdy and are slightly larger than I expected, ranging from 3.5 to 5 inches tall. They are very well made and are also a great teaching tool for matching colors. I'm very pleased."
5,Quality toy,"My 23 month old granddaughter enjoys playing with these. Here is why I like them.1. These are durable, colorful, and high quality. Nothing cheap or inferior about them.2. The magnetic caps are easy to take on and off, but also stay securely in place when on the bottles.3. My granddaughter likes to line these up in a row and count them. She also likes to take the caps from one bottle and put them onto a different bottle. Then we play a game to have her put the caps back onto the correct bottles.4. These go great with her play kitchen set.Bottom line: My granddaughter has fun with this toy, and also practices counting and color recognition. It's well worth purchasing this for your child."
5,lots of fun for aspiring chefs.,"This is a really great set. My daughter is 15 months old, and is in the put it on and take it off again faze. She loves these bottles! Since they came out of the box she has been ""seasoning"" her play cooking with these bottles. The magnets keep the caps on nice and tight, but it is still easy to remove them if you want. I also like that I can use them to work on her colors, since the caps match the bottles. Only disappointment is that the storage tray does not come with them anymore. I was a little upset by that. The picture on the box shows the tray, and the box even says it includes the tray. But no tray was to be found. Total bummer."
4,"Fun, cute, sturdy and good value","Just received this set. I ordered this for a two year old obsessed with ketchup! It's an accessory for his new wood toy kitchen. I was afraid the colors might be a bit jarring with the natural wood of his other toys, but was pleasantly surprised. They're sturdy and cute and he enjoys them. I like that the different caps aren't interchangable...it's good practice for matching colors. These aren't heirloom toys, but they're sturdy and will last. I wish the magnets were a bit stronger, but they do the trick. I'm happy with this purchase."
5,Great toy!,"Bought my kids these for Christmas (son is 4, daughter is 1.5) and they've really enjoyed them! I love how durable they are and that the labels don't peel off. They love taking the caps off and putting them back on."
5,Wonderful addition to any kitchen!,My daughter received these for her second birthday and they have been a favorite for over a year now. She loves to put the various condiments on all her creations and make up some silly combinations. The magnetic lids are great because they do not fall off.
4,fun toy,My 15 month old son loved this toy at first but doesn't play with it as much now. I'm hoping he will start playing with it again when we get him his play kitchen.
2,Stability issue,"Push up bars are lot more effective than just plain old push up. Having said that when I was using this, I felt like it will tip over when I came down on it. I suppose you could angle it at 45degrees and use them but if they made the legs little longer, I think it will be lot more stable. Made of light tubing doesn't help the stability either.."
5,"Solid product, light","This is a great value for the price. I looked at all the different push-up bars and decided I didn't want to spend the money on the metal bars. These really are good enough. I'm 6'1"", 175lbs, and don't feel any structural weakness in these. They're also light and easy to take apart in case you want to travel with them (I don't plan on traveling with them, but that's just me). Overall a good purchase!"
4,"Good, inexpensive push-up bars","There's not much to say about these push-up bars. They are inexpensive, plastic, and get the job done. They are probably not as sturdy as metal push-up bars, but if you use them as directed, they should work fine. If you are a really big person, you might want to invest in something that is higher quality."
4,Does It's Job,"It doesn't LOOK like it's made of plastic in the photos, but it is. Not the most sturdy, but it serves its purpose."
5,More effective push-ups,"Although these push-up bars are made from plastic, they support my 185 lb frame just fine. They make push-ups more effective by allowing you to dip lower. Very comfortable. Great item."
4,Function is great,Nice push-up bars. The ONLY thing I can complain about is that they are plastic and they bend slightly when using them. I would prefer metal. They seem to hold together fine though and I would recommend them.
4,Fast shipping,I bought last week...it was exactly as it described and the shipping was very fast i would reccommend going through these guys again.
4,Pretty good,"The TKO Extreme Training Push-up Bars are a very good product especially for the price. I am in the military and I need to do Push-ups fairly often. I don't have any issues doing them normally, but after using this product I have been able to improve the number I can do quite a bit. There are also very strong considering they are made of plastic. I weigh about 215 lbs and they hold me just fine. They are broken down very simply for easy transport, could easily fit in a gym bag. The only complaint I could give is that the rubber caps on the ends of the feet sometimes pop off when I am using these. It doesn't affect anything, just slightly annoying."
2,dismal attempt,I too love Lawson Fork and have watched it thrive following the Clean Water Act. The flora and fauna is diverse and it's recovery may be attributed to the wonderful work of the Spartanburg Sanitary Sewer Distict. The Sewer Distict is nationally recognized and has received numerous awards for their stewardship of our environment.The disparaging comments regarding the the Lawson Fork Wastewater Treatment Plant are not credible and I believe this is no more than an attempt by the authors to present themselves as environmental advocates. The authors should evaluate the water quality objectively or say nothing .norton
3,A bit of a let down...,After reading a few of McCammon's works I was looking forward to this one. Maybe it was the language he used or perhaps the subject matter but I just couldn't get into it. I read it to the end half-hoping for a boost of interest to spark in my noodle but it was not to be. A fair read although not one I would recommend.
3,Much potential but disappointing,"McCammon is gifted at weaving a story. I am a huge fan of historical fiction, but it is always a letdown when the author has his characters from another century speak and act the way we do today. These are supposed to be puritans folks; yet he has his men, women and children speaking often and openly with profanities that wouldn't even be used in the same settings today (teens openly describing sex acts at dinner with guests; women and children describe viewing the witch performing sex acts). And then there's the lengthy and graphic description of a man having sex with a horse. It just spoiled the story because it is so inauthentic that it seemed he just took the opportunity to use the historical period as a setting for modern day characters and couldn't go more than a few paragraphs without inserting scenes that seemed like they were copied from a men's magazine."
5,"A Gripping, Well-Constructed Story","McCammon delivers an excellently constructed story in his new novel. Obviously, painstaking research went into the work, yet various historical points, such as medical treatment of the day, were presented in a matter-of-fact way. A lot of today's authors give way too much focus to the results of research with detrimental effects to the story. This author utilizes historical context to add a unique dimension to the mystery of what is transpiring in the town of Fount Royal.Highly recommended."
4,Rober McCammon gets your attention,"Speaks the Nightbird is again e great epic novel. don't get confused and think that this is probably another horror novel with witches, devils and all kind of supernatural stuff. Well that's all I can say not disclosing to much about the plot.Reading in the train I nearly missed my station. That should give you an impression how breathtaking this adventure is (I even didn't work in the train, because I wanted to know the clue)"
3,And adequate entry,"I loved the first 400 pages of the book. As the mysteries and plot threads began to emerge and revolve and tangle, I was fascinated, waiting to see how McCammon would explain the strange goings on in his wonderfully real and remarkably detailed little town.And then he brought out the machete. Plot threads came to a screeching halt with bald description that did nothing to forward the story as a whole, the protagonists suddenly gained remarkable abilities and faculties never before to described and the ""plot twist,"" the answer to the whole mystery, was a bitter disappointment.But the first 400 pages are great, and the book ends adequately enough."
2,A well written but less-than-intriguing mystery,"I am blown back by all of the 4 and 5 star reviews on this book. Although Speaks the Nightbird is well written in the McCammon-style prose I love, the story line is sub-par, predictable, and the characters are uninteresting. The only element that kept me reading past page 70 was McCammon's beautiful, picturesque prose style. Once I got to Woodward's parable of the nightbird, I thought McCammon was on to something big -- an interesting universal philosophy about life. But Corbett's constant aimless prodding and missteps to nowhere become irritating quickly. This is not anywhere near the superb level of Boy's Life or Swan Song. Unfortunately, they are still selling this as a two-part mass-market paperback, while part two, ""Evil Unveiled,"" is no longer in print. Please do yourself a favor and avoid the mass-market paperback version of this book."
1,Hugely disappointing,"I am a voracious reader of historical novels, particularly those in the mystery vein. I don't expect the authors of these books to be 100 percent accurate in their depiction of the grammar, slang, and vocabulary of the periods they depict. I do expect, however, that the author bring a historical flavor to his work. This, sadly, is missing in ""Speaks the Nightbird."" What McCammon does is simply awkward and distracting. The dialog is replete with modernisms that no one in the 17th Century would ever have thought of uttering. The book is also full of anachronisms that deflect any reader who hopes to lose himself in the plot. I'll admit the story itself is compelling - I did finish the book after all - but the characters are cardboard and the exposition is, to say the least, wanting. I began this book expecting that I would like it; I was hugely disappointed."
3,Not a sequel ! Buyer Beware.,"Robert Mccammon is a great writer. I gave this book 3 stars for misleading information. I thought Volume II was a sequel to Volume I which would only make sense, however it is only a repetition of a section of the first book. In volume II it starts with Matthew finding the pots of oil on the beach and ending with freeing the accused woman and setting out on his journey to who knows where. It was like buying half of the first book. I don't understand why Mr. Mccammon would allow this misleading information to occur except for a profit. The outside cover clearly states ""Robert McCammon continues his triumphant return with the conclusion of an epic tale of suspense"". Conclusion ?? I don't think so. I was hoping I'd read about Matthew going to another town and solving another case. I really feel robbed and also disappointed in my favorite author."
1,"Great author, subpar book","Big fan of Robert McCammon but this book is not very good. Not horrible, just mediocre and I would have stopped reading on page 20 where I not such a huge fan. I suggest re-reading Swan Song or Carrion Comfort and passing on this subpar tome."
5,His best yet,"Sings the Nightbird is the finest novel this author has yet produced, and considering his other works, such as Boy's Life, Gone South, and the epic Swan Song, that's saying something. The novel concerns the coming age of a Magistrate's squire in a struggling colonial town, and a witchcraft trial which will forever change his life. The book richly evocates it's setting, and it's obvious McCammon has done a great deal of research into his subject matter. Although not an out and out horror novel, this has it's fair share of grisly moments, but bottom line it's an intensely involving and absorbing read with (unusually in this reader's experience) a richly rewarding climax. Not only that: but the book, despite being a fantastic stand alone work, manages to offer the tantalising prospect of a sequel. Robert McCammon is simply one of the finest authors working today. Read this, you will love it."
3,Speaks the Nightbird,"It was a good book, however there were 30 or more pages missing from the book at an important part of the book."
4,Enjoyable Period Novel,"This story takes place in America at the end of the 17th century. It is about a magistrate's clerk named Matthew Corbett, who solves a mystery concerning a town plagued by a so-called witch. I especially enjoyed the realistic descriptions of life in this time period. It was so interesting to watch a doctor try to ""cure"" someone who had a bad, common cold. The cure actually made the patient even sicker, until he finally died. Life was very hard during those times. I think anyone interested in this time period will enjoy this novel. It was written so well, that you know that the author must have spent a great deal of time doing research, before undertaking this book. If you are interested in something different to read, then this is the novel for you."
3,wrong barrel color,"The amazon photo is misleading. I received a red barrel Jotter, when all the product photos advertised the blue barrel. When I contacted the seller, she told me the product description shows assorted barrel. When I checked my invoice, it said ""asst. barrel"". I thought ""asst "" meant assisted.I'm keeping the red barrel pen because shipping costs $4 to and from.Amazon needs to stop using ambiguous abbreviations."
4,good reference,"I would recomend for a reference, not a textbook to learn ""new"" material. This book is small and brief, but contains no examples, just equations."
4,A must for fans of Hillerman,"Those who love Tony Hillerman's books will reap rich rewards from plodding through the first few somewhat less interesting chapters. Stick with it; once Tony gets into the Army and WWII you will be whipping through those pages! Tony gives an intimate view of wartime experiences of a kind I have not read or heard from other veterans. There's no macho bravado here, just the cold hard facts with a little humor mixed in. And when you reach the history of Tony's writing career you won't want the book to end. This memoir gently and modestly gives an insight into the character of one of the best loved mystery writers in America."
5,Hillerman,"Have read all his novels and his daughter's book, he drew amazing picturs with his words. Glad I could read about his life also in this book"
3,SKIP TO THE GOOD PARTS,"Tony Hillerman writes a better novel than he does a memoir. Here, he starts at the beginning. Seldom Disappointed is a fond look back at a life he has obviously enjoyed. The early reminiscences were probably of more interest to Hillerman than they were to me, but I enjoyed the reflections on his career. He got lots of practice writing as a journalist, then went back college and did a a big study of literature. His rise as a novelist was quick, a ""No,"" from his agent, before he sent a blind query off to a publisher--she read it, recommended a better last chapter and bought it. This was The Blessing Way which was soon nominated for best first novel by the Mystery Writers of America. And away he went."
2,Tony Hillerman Seldom Disappoints,"Tony Hillerman's autobiography held my attention from start to finish. Mr. Hillerman is a member of the ""Greatest Generation,"" was a combat infantryman in France and Germany during WWII. I thought I'd read to the end of that segment and then move on, but Tony's narrative carried me on to the end. Truly, Mr. Hillerman has led an interesting and blessed life. We are all in his debt for his efforts as a writer and as a human being."
5,A story that you will want to finish.,"Cast loose from spiritual moorings, a third-generation American and secular Jew, Colin Stonegrows up in the suburbs of New York, attends Hebrew school, is bar-mitzvahed, but never touched by his religion. Written in the first person and present tense, just helps to pull you into the story. Extremely well written and captivating."
4,A Thought Provoking and Powerful Book,"As with most of this sort from LIFE, this book is a sad and joyful tribute to life, to people, and to earth. Actually, I would of easily given it 5 stars, if it hadn't made me cry so much. Beware though, this book is not for kids, as it does potray some graphic violence between its many pages."
5,the book of this century,I think i would rate this book as a book that comes only once in a millenium.The pictures are breathtaking.further more the writer in simple language has conveyed to the reader what he has to say very briefly
5,A great book.,How do you shoe the history of the past century in pictures. Life has come as close as anyone can to do this. This is a great book and should be viewed by everyone. Photographers would be especially taken with the presentation. One must take time in looking through the book as there is so much to cover. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
2,Life,"This book contained a very biased segment of American life, mainly that of immoral Hollywood and Washington. What of the families and individuals of America that put this nation together, the farmers, school teachers, workers, the miners, soldiers, etc. whose contributions are not protrayed adequately in this book."
5,Read me. Turn my pages. Fold my corners.,"One of the best books I have picked up in the past thirty years. Not only does this book show phenomenal pictures from over the past century, it has information on every decade. If you happened to turn your brain off during the sixties and seventies, Life highlights all the ponderous drivel you missed during that blackout span. Great for kids and adults alike....."
