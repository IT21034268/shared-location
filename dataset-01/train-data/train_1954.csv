2,Out of date resource,"I passed boards without ever really using this book- I bought most of the Mosby's series as they were highly recommended by other students/recent grads and professors. Many of the questions/answers were out of date. The review questions are not similar to the format of boards questions, so it doesn't help you that way either. If you are just looking for a supplemental book of quick questions to test yourself on and you have the time for some extra study material, than these books will be alright for you. If not, there are far more valuable resources out there for you to spend your time and money on.Likes:Quick questionsCan do short study sessions between class/clinicsDislikes:Some questions have out of date informationNot in board question formatSome questions not relevant (would unlikely be on boards)Bottom line:There are better study resources out there. Use this only if you have time for a supplemental study aid."
3,5 star for the watch but.. 1 star for the seller (WatchZone)...,"Excellent chronograph (very nice looking and very light) and excellent price, even if the alarm is not designed for daily use. My problem was that the watch, sold by WatchZone, was deliverd with the case scratched and without warranty booklet, but I can't return it because of the too expensive fees as per WatchZone return policy (1/3 the watch price, from europe). I hope that Amazon will check better the policies of its ""marketplace seller"" for better costumer satisfaction! how can I be satisfied of a new watch scratched that i can't return? people, please, read carefully before buying!"
3,"Huge Disappointmet out of the Box, waiting for long term","After reading all the rave reviews I purchased this watch as a gift for my husband, only to have him open it, and be unable to even set the time as the dial button was jammed and would not move even with pliars. We had to send it back for a replacement and we are awaiting the arrival of that. I will update my review after we have its replacement and see how it does, if we can ever set the time."
1,Hands not on marks,"My Seiko had the sweep hand start on the 2 second mark after 5 months of use. It was sent to Seiko for repair and when I finally got it back the hand started on the #9 position. Lousy repair service.It is also a heavy watch.While it was being repaired, I bought a Timex for $34.99. It keeps perfect time and it is alot lighter. I wear my timex now."
2,Fantastic watch but amazon fails to support the promotion they offer.,"They advertised 25 dollar discount for the watch if I buy by Nov 13. I bought this on Nov 9. Yet I did not receive discount from Chase card. I called Chase bank to ask for discount. They reported that this purchase reported after 13th. So, I will not get discount. So it is messy system maintenance at Amazon.On watch, this watch is a good watch but lot of technical details such as how to set time for DST."
1,not very sophisticated,"While I'm a huge fan of the Q&A; approach, this book just does a really bad job with it. The questions offer endless repitition of the same few (very basic) ideas, rather than altering the facts a little to get different results under the tax code. As a consequence, you'll do nothing but get bored trying to work through these questions, even if you're really trying to learn the material (because instead of getting hit with new ideas you'll just get question after question asking the same thing (and answer after answer that is identical, like they were written mostly just using cut-and-paste). Also, this book covers *much* less material than any law school corp. tax course. While it treats all the main topics (incorporation, distributions, mergers and reorgs), it does so only on a *highly* superficial level.Love the Q&A; idea, wish this book executed well. Save your time and money."
5,Very Helpful,I found the questions and answers to be a great way to work through the corporate tax rules. I'd definitely recommend it if you are taking a class or trying to learn the rules yourself.
5,"268 pages of documented, persuasive ammunition","I have been writing letters and calling public officials about this issue for months now. This book is exactly what's needed -- I will be ordering 10 of them, so I can give them to the people in decisionmaking positions who just don't ""get it.""I've now had two public officials tell me that by the time they were halfway through the book, they were converted: We must have paper ballots, not some time in the future, but BEFORE the fall elections.I congratulate Harris on her meticulous research and very readable book -- she manages to put a sense of humor into this, and at the same time, eviscerates the dumb arguments against auditing elections and public counting of the vote."
5,Best when compiled with Invisible Ballots,Bev is a featured expert on the newly released video Invisible Ballots. The DVD has two versions for using in public presentations depending on your time slot. The producer is Academy Nominated William Gazecki. You can buy Black Box and Invisible Ballots for $35.56 at http://www.realityzone.com/ballots.html. Definately worth it.
3,The History of Erie County Pennsylvania From it's First Settlement,Too much information that goes out of this area.Need to publish one on the original settling families & that history.
2,too skinny,"this is THE book to get if you are still choosing a PC to run Logic on. Half the book is taken up with detail on SCSI/UDMA/Memory/Motherboard configurations better for audio use.if you already have this bit sorted, the remainder of the book is no more than a flashy introduction to the audio capabilities of logic. info of this small depth should be free.definitely not a manual, or lasting companion to recording audio on a PC. still waiting for Fast Guide to Logic Audio!"
1,Audio information does me no good...,"Fair Warning - This book does nothing to help you understand the Midi/Sequencing side of Logic, which unfortunately is what I was hoping for. If you're looking for audio help, this may be the place, however I like examples where the book gives you step by step instructions to follow to show a process or trick. This book has none of those. It more or less focuses on system requirements, what a PC's components do,what to look for, and then some audio info, but honestly was a HUGE disapointment for myself overall."
2,Not exactly what it seems,"I have found that this book is a very poor companion to the Emagic documentation (which is pretty bad). First, the book assumes that you know how to use prior versions of Logic. Nowhere does it even attempt to describe the basics of how to start using the program. Second, nearly 70 pages are dedicated to general computer issues, not Logic. Third, the book is based on a beta version of Logic 4 (which it apologizes for). Unfortunately, this is a critical problem because the menu stucture in Logic 4 is very different that the book's examples. Last, it really needs a good proofreading. There are many errors, sentence fragments, spelling errors, and an irritating habit of using > < for >emphasis<."
3,basic guide book with tips - best for beginners.,"It seems PC-based recording guide book rather than Logic Audio guide book. The writer spended 2/3 of book for basic concepts of effectors, system set-ups and basic mixing ways. Yes, it's a good book, but if you already have books about mix-down or recording, you may be able to do the same thing with the books and original manual book of Logic Audio - without spending money on this book."
1,What about the program?,"You'd imagine a book with the words--""Guide to Logic Audio Windows"" in the title would be about how to use a software program by the same name. Apparently this is not true. >Plenty< full of attempts at cleverness. I kept waiting for the filler to end and the information to begin, but I hit the back cover before that happened. Save your money for ""Fast Guide to Logic Audio Platinum"" when it comes out. It >has< to be better!"
5,fantastic Regency Era Historical.....,"I'm so glad I picked this romance up despite it's embarrassingly cliche' ""mostly nude couple"" cover. Set in Regency England-this passionate, thrilling and heartwarming tale of Maggie and Nicholas was an enthralling read from beginning to end. While I agree with another reviewer that the storyline may have been a bit predictable-the story is told in such a well written way that that doesn't matter.I also enjoyed that the passionate scenes added, not detracted, from the love story. The secondary characters are fabulous in this story as well-a mark, in my opinion, of a quality romance. If you like highly romantic, adventuresome stories ala' vintage Johanna Lindsey and Catherine Coulter, then I think you will like this book.Sensuality rating-8-pretty detailed and steamy.5 stars-recommended."
4,A Great New Discovery,"For a few of us, the Floating Men are not a new discovery, but if you haven't heard them yet, it's time to take a listen. I must say that my favorite CD by the Floating Men is one of their earliest, Tall Shadows, but that may have more to do with nostalgia than with the quality of the music. See them live if they are playing anywhere near you...they are unbelievable in person!"
5,History Comes to Life,"Many more French people were killed by other French people during this period than during the French Revolution.The book describes what happens when panic follows tragic events and the search for scapegoats begins. Horne is one of the best history writers ever. After reading this book, you'll want more- such as his books on the loss of Algeria and the fall of Paris."
2,Miltaristic history,"The book is fine if you view history through the lens of a right-wing, military, reactionary point of view. If you want an unbiased view then you should probably try a different book."
3,Arid,"By no means a bad book or even an unworthy effort. Indeed, ""The Fall of Paris"" is well researched and written, enlightening and informative, balanced and thoughtful. It's all those things, and more. What it isn't is vivid and exciting. Boring? No. Drawn in hues of gray? Yes. When there's a tale of sieges and battles and strife, I don't want to be told it; I want to live it. Christopher Hibbert does this sort of thing very well, as does Donald Morris and Byron Farwell. Alistair Horne? Not so much. (In fairness, he does a better job in his ""A Savage War of Peace"", exploring the French-Algerian conflict.)Horne is an outstanding historian and a solid writer, and I recommend ""The Fall of Paris"". But if you're looking for a book that will keep you up to the wee hours, look elsewhere."
4,Good reading,"Not the BEST (ie 5 star) but it kept my um, 'attention' thru several readings.....Definently a one-handed book....Enjoy!"
1,peels off the wall,"These stickers are really cute and make a little girl feel like the true princess that they really are, so we decorated my daughters bathroom with the stickers. They looked so cute when we had finished. To my dismay, the next morning when we went into her bathroom they were peeling or coming down. She was so sad and so was I. They cost over $20 so they are definitely not worth that. They may better attach to a notebook or something but the name of them are Self-Stick Wall Decorating Kit, so you do the math. I am very disappointed in them and I feel like the name is misleading."
1,Peeled off my wall. Daughter cried her eyes out. :(,"Followed all instructions: washed the walls, etc. Started peeling off overnight. After a few days, some starting falling on the floor."
4,Absolutely Brilliant!,"Lindgren is a genuine literary expert! I like her Bill Bergson series best, but I found this book to be stunning and read it all in one day. Matt's behaviour was hysterically funny, especially when he became angry. And I was very touched by Birk and Ronia's carefulness to maintain their friendship, especially in the incident with the knife. Great contrast between the brash and the tender. Lindgren is very gifted in her ability to convey such vivid emotions and scenes. I like how the ending is rather vague and leaves you to imagine the ""happily ever after"". Great book!"
5,Young At Heart,Young At Heart is what describes me each time I pick up one of Astrid Lindgren's books. They have been somewhere in my life for the last 25 years whether before my eyes or only in my memory and I feel I am a better person for it. Astrid Lindgren's books are stories of heart and this is my favorite. I hope you enjoy it as much as me and love it enough to pass it on. Thank you.
5,A Childeren's Classic!,"The last time I read this book was when I was nine, but the images have stayed with me all this time. I got my copy of RONIA a couple of days ago from Amazon.com, and it is better than I remembered. The aching loving relationship between parents and children, and the pain of making choices that come against that (called 'growing up') is beautifully brought out in this brilliant tale, set against a landscape of a forest with dark stands of trees, populated by beasts of the earth, and harpies and dwarves, and a lighting-riven castle. Although not quite so explicit, it is a Romeo and Juliet type story, with the charm and appeal of innocence. Ronia is a headstrong heroine who will capture your imagination instantly!"
5,Lovely,"I also read this book as a little girl and couldn't put it down. Ronia is exactly how I want my daughters to be someday: independent, fierce, adventurous, and willing to use moss as a pillow."
5,I can't wait til dawn,"This cd is definitely a collectors item, one that I will share with others on many different occasions."
3,Used for two years,"This is a good product but it does not stick as well as I would like. Some of the edges do separate from the envelope you are attaching it too. Unfortunately this is the only company I can find that makes this size. Amazon is the BEST BUY you can find with a fantastic return policy. It is my opinion that the Best Buy Store has a terrible return policy and may soon be going out of business. They want your Photo ID when you return any item. If you are returning an item purchased on your Credit/Debit card and the return is being applied to your Credit/Debit card you should not have to show any ID. This is an invasion of privacy. They are collecting information from your photo ID that is beneficial too their agenda. This information could be sold, bartered, traded or given to any organization. It is also my opinion that the so-called Best Buy Store will go out of business within 3-5 years. Good luck and Thank You Amazon for letting me post this review."
2,"Many facts, no pulse","This biography appears to be complete and well-researched but is buried by facts, names, dates, etc. without any sense of character or passion. The book, and the main character, have no pulse, making this an academic exercise in annotated timelines."
2,"Everyone else is right, I think ...","Anthony Levi is trying to be fair to the Cardinal, whose reputation has endured hundreds of years of mudslinging. But Levi can't write well (perhaps English isn't his first language?) and nobody edited him well. I've read far worse, so I was eventually able to break through the poor sentence structure and dig out the meaning, but not everyone wants to do that. someone else mentioned that Levi has a hard time placing the Thirty Years War; I have to agree -- I wouldn't know when it was held based on Levi's writing alone. I borrowed it from a public library, and I'm glad -- I certainly wouldn't spend $77 on this book! It's just not worth it. If you can't find it in your local library, and you need it for some reason, get the paperback. You won't be reading this over and over and over for fun."
3,"An okay port, but not the best","Ms. Pac-Man is awesome. Arcade games are awesome. Arcade games ported to home consoles are AWESOME.The Commodore 64 version is faithful to the arcade game, but it isn't really so great.The graphics are really great on the Commodore, and the sound is good, considering the hardware.The one thing that docked points off, though, was the control scheme. If you don't have a joystick, then you'll be trapped by the ghosts very quickly. Pressing Backspace to move up and Enter to move down glitches up Ms. Pac-Man for you. YOU NEED THE JOYSTICK. Otherwise, you'll end up looking at laughable movements.At least this version is better than the dumb NES port."
5,Works Great,This replacement bottle fit my Delta RP1001 Soap/Lotion Dispenser perfectly. I was concerned it wouldn't fit based on other reviews.
1,"Didn't fit, but received full refund","I was disappointed that this replacement bottle did not fit my dispenser. I am extremely disappointed since I had been looking for a while. I emailed the seller of the situation and they quickly refunded my money and actually asked me not to return it. I appreciated since I did order 2, but wonder why they didint need me to return it."
3,Buy this or>>>>>>>,"The threads were not a problem as with the previous reviewer. Screwed on Fine to my Delta faucet.My problem is paying this much for a cheap plastic bottle. And as it is small, one that requires frequent refills.One solution is to buy flexible hosing, sized for the pump feed, from a local hardware store. Make sure it is long enough to go to the floor under your sink, in as big of a bottle of dishwashing soap as you can find in Costco."
5,I can actually play this music,"I was so pleased to discover that the music written was not difficult for me as a person who played when younger and trying to come back and play now - I'm quite rusty, but when I sat down to play, I did not feel overwhelmed. This music is to go with the CD I purchased - beautiful. Thank you."
4,"Here I Am, Lord CD",Great listening for those who enjoy piano performers.Smooth presentations of all hymns on the CD.
5,Awesome! Looks so realistic it is impressive!,"Got this product as a practical joke for a co-worker. We are always doing things to each others cubicals and I decided this was the perfect item for it. I simply put down some plastic wrap on her desk, poured the prepared snow on the desk, wrote her name in it with my finger, and put a tiny snowman figurine in the middle. I must say it looks so realistic and lasts for so long that you will be blown away.If you're looking at this item wondering how well it works, trust me, it works awesome and makes soooo much snow with so little powder. This packt can easily make gallons of snow for weeks."
3,"Great story, weak translation","I was assigned this book for a second-year university course, and while I loved most of the aspects of the story itself, I found the translation very weak and awkward. Roche-Mahdi tries to incorporate modern language and idioms into her translation that don't work with the story's setting or tone at all. She also takes a decidedly man-hating feminist stance in her approach, which when you look at the actual details of the story is (at least in my opinion) completely unjustified. The original author praises and criticizes men and women equally, but Roche-Mahdi seems out to convince the reader that everything about it is misogynistic. The book is also riddled with typos, I'm really not sure how or why it was published in such an unpolished manner, but I personally found it irritating.The story itself is great, sadly I haven't found another translation of it anywhere."
5,bt does it again. The master makes you move,"bt has to be the best there is regarding electronic music. He knows how to make you move (even when you are sitting down), but seems motivated and inspired by his craft as opposed to what will sell. He needs to come to my house and personally thank me for this glowing review. While he is here, he can spin a record or two."
1,a mistake,The numbers were difficult to read. Play was slow and difficult to manipulate. I wasted my money. Instead I downloaded a shareware version for my computer that is excellent and just threw the handheld game in the trash after playing 5 or 6 times.I bought an electronic Saduko hand held game at the same time and found it to be well conceived unlike this travesty.
2,Lost even more hair!,"I bought this because I had used some samples that really seemed to be effective after just 3 weeks, but when my purchase arrived in the mail, not only was the consistency different from the sample, I began to notice that the small amount of hair growth I had experienced from using the sample, went away and I started losing even more hair. The shampoo did seem to help hinder hair loss, which is why I give it two stars, but the treatment 'gel' has left me with significantly less hair after 6 months. I don't want to risk losing more, so I stopped using it. I was concerned that what was in the bottle wasn't the same thing as what was in the sample. Wish I could get a refund and get my hair back."
3,Didn't work to prevent chemo hair loss for me.,"I bought this and the shampoo hoping it would prevent my hair loss from chemo. However, one of my chemo agents is Taxol and my hair has begun to fall out 15-17 days after the first chemo session. But if you find that you are not on Taxol I would think this product would work. It did make my hair and scalp feel better than it had in a long time so was very hopeful it would work. Since it is coming out very slowly perhaps thymuskin slowed the inevitable process?"
1,Should be labeled used,"Just received this yesterday. This is not new nordoes it appear new. Unit had some minor scratchesand blemishes but was not labeled as such. Remanufacturedgenerally means any defects are repaired. It comes ina plain brown box stuffed with brown paper packing materialand inserted in a plastic bag with poorly photocopiedinstructions. Date code on the unit is July 2004, sowho knows what it's history is. Only tried the basicfeatures, but it does seem to work okay so far. Amazoncould have done a better job of describing this itemand that it is basically a blemished unit. Probablyworth the 30 bucks if it doesn't fail right after the90 day warranty expires."
2,panasonic invisible time,"Whilke this may be a great little radio, you do not get much flexibility in wake-up features such as radio for two wake-up times, etc. You also cannot read the time if you are not at eye level with the radio.........our radio is on a dresser about 10"" higher than the bed and you cannot read the numbers at all.I sent it back"
1,"if it works, it's great, but it won't even turn on","I bought as a wedding gift for my husband. I know I bought it as refurbished, but after a month or so, it wouldn't turn on with blinking red light. I called the customer service and was told to send it to the repair service center. The guys came and picked it up and it never came back until I had an ordeal with the repair service center and Philips customer service center. It was nightmare to get it fixed and get it back after 6 month. One year later, the same problem appeared and we decided to let it go and buy another one. Like I said, if it works, it is great, but once it is broken, you might as well forget about the TV and get a new one."
4,Honest,"Honest is the best way to describe ""Child of My Right Hand"", written by my friend's father. Candid, and honest, this novel seeks to portray the complicated relationship between straight parent and gay child from all angles - mother, father, and son. But it does much more than that: it explores the complexities of our unfaithful, scatterbrained human hearts, and shows off Eric Goodman's (whom I know as ""Lizzie's"" Dad's) intelligent - often shocking - wit.The only complaint - the reason why I give the novel 4 stars instead of 5 - is that some of the minor characters (the son's high school principal, Lizzie's purple-haired friend's father, and ""Fry Guy's"" boss) are a little plastic and unrealistic. Overall, however, its an excellent read."
4,"Good hose, but no more pinch resistant than others","I like this hose. In fact, I'm buying another because my house has very few outdoor spigots. However, I don't see that this hose is any more pinch-resistant than other hoses. It crimps and pinches just like all the others. I would not have even thought much about this -- hoses do crimp and pinch -- except that it was described as crimp-resistant."
3,This Hose is Kinky!,Overall this hose is an average hose. Its a great length and relatively light weight. Unfortunately I spend as much time getting kinks out as I do watering. I have never owned a hose that kinks as easily as this hose.
4,No complaints,It's a hose. Seems to work fine. No signs of crimping yet after about a month of occasional use. The price was pretty good.
4,Trip Back in Memory Lane,"I am now 14 years old and the last time i saw this movie was probably when i was 4. when the care bears were coming back ""in"" all my younger cousins had care bear tapes,stuffed animals and apparel. One day i watched a movie and it reminded me of care bears adventures in wonderland. i really liked this movie because i was obsessed with princesses and the beautiful gowns i think this is a great movie to any girl who loves princesses and care bears!Watch It!(this may be cheezy to ""girls older than 6) :)"
4,Great watch and price,"The only reason I rated this as 4 stars is that you can't really see the hour and minute hands in the dark. I know the description says that the hands are luminescent but they really aren't. Other than that, the watch looks great - has the right balance of sporty and class."
1,The Worst-Twice,"I received this fryer as a gift. I really liked the ability to removwe the bowl to clean this fryer. So far in my cooking with it, that is the only positive to it. The fryer never gets to the set temperature. The thermostat on this unit is irrelevant. It will never get above 300 degrees. I have actually returned/exchanged the one received as a gift, and the new one is just the same."
4,Great CD,Great CD from a not so widely known blues slide guitarist who is no longer with us. Not his best but still good.
2,ok,I have a few books on the high points but this one offers the most horrable maps and instructions.Not reccomended.
2,Why did I buy this book?,"This book contains driving directions to the trailheads, but this is information easily obtained from any road map. Beyond that there are BRIEF descriptions of a single route to the summit (whatever the author chose, not necessarily the most interesting). Finally, if the summit can be driven up, there are NO descriptions for hiking the mountain. Why would anyone buy this book?"
5,A great way to see the States,"Take this book with you the next time you hit the road. It will take you to interesting places you would otherwise never see. It is full of detailed, well presented driving and route information to get you to the all of the state highpoints. It also includes additional information and pointers to supplement your visit in each state. Truly a must have to round out your traveling enjoyment."
3,Nothing exciting here folks.,"If you want lots of information on a topic, this is the book for you. Very detailed-orientated. It has about 210 chapters on various pop culture topics. Don't look for color pictures in this book, you won't find any, just b & w. Much more text than pictures."
1,Disaster.,"This is one of the worst law books I have ever read. It was assigned for an upper-level constitutional class. Trying to decipher what the authors are attempting to impart through the near total use of squibs as opposed to full opinions, and their own cryptic notes interspersed among snipets of the cases, is next to impossible to accomplish. In addition, their particular method of editing is intrusive and annoying. Some of the brightest minds in the country have written classic opinions on the very important subjects in this book. Why in the world Sullivan and Gunther think they can do better is beyond me given their result. Avoid this book like the plaque if at all possible."
1,Worst...law...book...ever,"I had to use this book (and it's useless supplement) for my con law class. The main cases are poorly edited as they include too much of the original text--reading an entire 10 page opinion is fairly useless to a law student, especially since a con law exam covers so many topics. The secondary cases are poorly edited in the opposite respect--a holding and only a few words about the facts.Overall, the worst part about the book is that there is little offered by the author in terms of guidance through the muck of Supreme Court decisions. Many in my class preferred to work with Chemerinsky'sConstitutional Law: Principles And Policies (Introduction to Law Series). Once I finally picked up that book and used it to study for the final, Con law all of the sudden made perfect sense to me. Chemerinsky was completely clear, and I have to recommend him if you are a law student."
1,Forget it . . . Get Emanuel's.,"Don't even bother with this one. Get Emanuel's. It's a million times clearer, a billion times more readable, and a trillion times more helpful for the final exam. Thanks again, Mr. Steven L. Emanuel; you are a savior."
3,Deep and insightful.,"Written over a series of centuries, primarily consisting of the delusional ramblings of 9 old white men, the plotline of the novel is loose at best. Fortunately, the protagonists, ever-shifting, are a compelling ensemble of rapscallions and rebels. Although the ending is ill-defined, the core values can be applied to a wide variety of situations. I'll probably buy Sullivan's next novel."
4,A very good casebook for a very difficult subject,"Profs Gunther and Sullivan's casebook is an excellent casebook for Constitutional Law which is a difficult area of law professors to teach and for law students to understand.Pros: Good case edits; excellent, almost flawless treatment of materials up until the First Amendment materials; instructive, informative, and, at times, prophetic notes to the cases.Cons: The First Amendment Section of the book (roughly the last 500 pages) suffers at times from a thematic layout that sometimes confuses the chronological timeframes; because of the formatting of the text, the notes that follow the case are sometimes difficult to distinguish from the cases themselves and/or note cases."
4,Why did you change the TITLE from GRANDAD'S TEETH?,As a Teacher /Librarian all the six picture books short listed for the AUSTRALIAN BOOK AWARDS are read to all students and studies of Authors/Illustrators/Publishers etc are covered in Library Time. Year 6 students use the internet as part of their studies .We were all surprised to see the title changed.However even Kinder loved spotting the difference.Please explain?
2,Skatboarding,This book is all about skateboarding and how to do tricks on skateboards. It isn't very good to learn from though because the book only uses words instead of pictures to help visualize on the trick being performed.
1,"Caroline Zilboorg's Book ""The Masks of Mary Renault""","After reading this book I must say that Ms. Zilboorg certainly has included much speculation and an active would-be psychologists' imagination. Unfortunately there is not a clear grasp of her subject, and in fact there is much here that leads one astray from the real Mary Renault and her life. I cannot recommend this book to anyone who has a genuine appreciation for Ms. Renault, and urge those who do to persue the excellent and informative book ""Mary Renault, A Biography"",by David Sweetman; someone who really 'knows' her."
2,Performance & sonics mar the music,These Granados pieces are just wonderful but this performance and recording leave much to be desired. The sound quality is rather flat and 2D. The performance lacks any real sparkle or drama. It is overall rather studentish. Those looking for better performances might look to Alicia de Larrocha or others.
5,The favorite in our house,"My daughter just LOVED this book when she was 1-2. While I can't personally figure out what it has going for it, I do know that I read it aloud more times than any other book on the shelf. I had the regular hardcover -- this board book looks more likely to hold up to the demand my kids put on it."
3,Educational but gets redundant. I recommend a used copy.,"The topic of this book is interesting. I read about half of the book in one day but then slogged through the remainder before I started skimming to the end. It's well-written but not completely thought out, as many of the community money examples end with summaries like ""this may or may not work in your particular community."" It seemed to me that those examples were rehashed several times before the end of the book. If you want to learn about money, then this book has something to offer but I think it runs out of gas. For the value, I recommend a used copy."
5,Groundbreaking concepts that dispell economic illusions,"Greco's book is astonishing in what it conveys about the truth and reality of our financial and economic system compared to the illusions we have been consistently led to believe for years. Highly recommended for a good dose of ""the truth will set you free."""
5,a valuable book,"This book is a fruit of the author's ""warm heart and cool head."" The value of this book is to demonstrate a theory and a method for democratizing the power to issue money. We can understand the necessity for local currencies in order to decrease the concentration of power in monetary and financial system."
2,Too technical,This book was not our cup of tea. My husband and I like more practical guidance that does not read in such therapeutic terms. We have a 3 year old.
3,Shoe may not be for you.,"Pros are the slight padding in the toe zone and the large platform which allows for the high heel to be not so high an angle for your arch and the clear plastic across the top of your foot/around ankle which makes your legs look longer and more lovely. Con is the clear plastic across the top of your foot, which when worn for actually going out of the bedroom say to dance or walk about a club becomes heated up by your foot and stretches, so that your toes eventually claw out over the edge of the front of the shoe; which is not comfortable or attractive."
3,Good Recipes,"I have not made any of the recipes in this book yet; but looking through this book I saw some above average recipes. However, most recipes seem to be the kind found in other cookbooks. Not a large book."
4,Good,"As described but wish it had more pictures, otherwise a good product. I gave it as a gift and it was a hit"
3,Somewhat sub-par for Naxos,"After so thoroughly enjoying Naxos' recording of Hofmann's cello concerti, I'm sad to say I'm disappointed by this one. The music is interesting, but the playing doesn't live up to the usual high standards I expect from Naxos in this repertoire--even though they use modern orchestras for their 18th Century series, most of the performances are good enough that you don't really notice that fact. But in this case I find them less than enjoyable, mostly because of the violinist's intrusive and constant vibrato. A rare Naxos disappointment."
4,Fascinating read.,I found this book to be completely fascinating and enjoyed it thoroughly. It WAS quite wordy though and I could see it easily drag on for someone who wasn't interested in the subject. I loved it though. I would have liked the author to focus more on the symptoms and details of the experiment and less on Ancel Keys though. (the scientist that conducted the experiment.)
5,A lovely product amongst your planting.,"Looks beautiful and as if you rescued it from a stately home in Europe. It looks antique but here is a tip, if you want it to look weathered, take some live natural yoghurt (plain and unflavoured!) water the yoghurt down slighty. Then paint a coat of this solution all over the statue. In 6 months or so this attract beautiful mosses and lichens to grow all over the statue, giving it a lovely aged look! It really works!"
2,"No Physical Switch Overide for Hot Keys, Loses Connectivity","Hot key command sequence stops working. Initially this device operated ok, but after a few hours of operation (idle -- not switching between PC's) the KVM loses connectivity with the PC's. A hard reboot is necessary, making the KVM useless. There are no physical switches on the unit to overide the hot keys. I returned the unit and replaced with an Airlink AKVM-S32 which appears to be functioning well."
1,It works...as long you don't turn off your computers!,"When I restart my computers (something I do at least once a week) this kvm switch stops working: the mouse loses its functionality and sometimes even the keyboard ""disappears"" so that the only way to restart the computer is through a ""hard reboot"".Returned."
2,it is ok,it folds and doesn't stay flat. the embroidery is good but wish it was on a better quality mat. it is alsoto thin
3,"If Your'e a Fan, You'll Love It","Kind of hard to make a small stage the main focus of the film even with the Giants present upon it. Baker, Clapton and Winwood look and act physically tired (to much party the night before ?), though Grech played/sang well. Check out Winwood's fingernails -- looks as if he were digging in the garden before the show. Still, it is great to see Blind Faith in action (albeit on film), when I wish I had seen them live."
2,"Good playing, abysmal singing","If this is the only evidence on film of Blind Faith, that's a pity. The performance from the band for the most part is pretty decent but Winwood's voice is shot. A couple of numbers are barely up to snuff vocally. This outing sounds like a rehearsal in Hyde Park rather than the actual concert."
3,Dizzy??,"I agree with Michael Burton. What horrible editing and camera work. When I saw this DVD on the shelf I almost flipped. ""Could it Be,!?"" I said. Wow a must have! Blind faith in 1969. I bought the disc immediatley and took it home with high expectations. I was tremendously dissappointed. As a guitar player i get very upset when I cant see what is going on. The morons showed eric claptons left hand like 3 times. I got to see more of the idiot stoners in the crowd than the band that I paid to see. Whoever edited this DVD should be sent to a retirement home. BOYCOTT!!"
2,Blind Faith - Unfortunately the only DVD available,"Disappointing, poor sound & picture quality, as well !!!It's a pity, they should in this case have remastered it, rather to issue it almost 40 years later like that.Winwood's voice is really short and I have been to a Traffic concert with his superb voice.This film looks like a bootleg, like a rehearsal rather than the actual concert.But on of the few bootlegs that I bought, I have a live concert in South of France of Blind Faith the sound is a pity too.Since there is no evidence of another film of a concert of Blind Faith by BBC for example after 40 years there no other choice as far as I know.At the end of the 60's numerous DVDs were recorded at the Isle of Wight but professionally."
5,The best ever- very well done,"This thing is INCREDIBLE!!!The quality of the misic as remastered is as if it was recorde in a studio yesterday.The quality of the video part is outstanding as well. I don't know how they do this, but this video is worth every penny and more. It's living history of the music that shaped my generation. I was in Viet Nam when they performed this, so I feel as if I got to see it in person.Enjoy"
2,Kind of a rip,"As others have pointed out, the group was just getting it together when the concert was filmed and it shows. While the audio is good, the performances in no way match the classic album they produced. Also, the ""extras"" added to fill out this fairly slight offering, particularly those for Clapton and Baker are taken from the almost equally slight Farewell Concert film made about Cream.For die hard fans and completists only."
2,Keep the faith?,"This crude recording is actually more of an archive than a musical resource for enjoyment. When you see it, you will be shocked as to the aural quality, the appearance of the ""star"" performers, the tinniness of Steve Winwood, etc. The recording was so crude and makeshift that the band, were it still together, might well have had it buried.Blind Faith was a composite band, making up all-stars from other prior bands. Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Bruce, with most vocals distinctive with little ""Stevie"" Winwood's warbling but enjoyable voice, Clapton's consistently solid, if not always great, guitar, etc. Their magnum opus album, Blind Faith, is one of the great albums of all time. However, this DVD unravels that, making the songs sound not simply worse than the studio(a common occurence in recording) but MUCH worse to the point of being unrecognizable.Don't buy this unless you want simply an historical record of the group, to be played with the sound off..."
5,Enviable glimpse of rock history,This gets five stars because it is an amazing view of rock royalty in action. Who says Blind Faith played badly that day? They sounded just like their record to me! And I must dispute the thinking of the author plugging his Jefferson Airplane book. Blind Faith's Hyde Park performance was June 7th 1969. Brian Jones drowned July 3rd and the Stones played Hyde Park two days later the same year. Nobody was mourning Brian Jones at Blind Faith's gig because he wasn't dead yet! At any rate we are fortunate to live in a day and technological age where so many great and historical rock moments are available for us to relive over and over.
4,"blind faith a beautiful sunny day and thousands of hippies having epileptic seizures, what more could you ask for?","First off, I cant understand all the criticism on the concerts sound and transfer. This is 1969 folks and shot outdoors. I actually thought the dvd looked and sounded pretty damn good. Considering how short the bands run was together its awesome to have any vintage document of live material. If your expecting top notch production values like there are today you might be a little dissapointed. However, if your looking for a superb moment in music history with legendary players doing there thing I would encourage you to get this. You wont regret it."
1,Blind Faith London Hyde Park 1969,"I had to order this twice because the first one would not work/load properly. The second one acted the ""same"" way! It is NOT my DVD Player. I have hundreds of DVD's and have NO problem with any of them except this one. What I ""was"" able to watch(the concert itself) was Excellent! Was not able to view ""any"" of the other extra/bounus tracks because I couldn't."
1,No Blind Faith Hyde Park DVD in US,"Sanctuary Visual Entertainment, the label that issued this DVD, informed me that it will not be released in the US due to contractual problems. Reviewers here apparently have the DVD in the European PAL format and not the North American NTSC format and perhaps they have equipment that was able to convert from one to the other. Thus, you will NOT be able to order this DVD from Amazon-US unless and until any contractual problems get resolved. And that's a shame. I was so looking forward to finally, after 37 years, being able to seeing some footage of this supergroup. I may order it directly from the label and find someone able to convert formats for me. The 1 star is here only because Amazon requires me to give a rating, but since I cannot view the product, I cannot properly give it a rating."
2,Bosanova/Jazz/Samba,"For one who has much of A. C. JOBIM's recordings, I found this album rather dissapointing. His compositions are excellent, but his performances were always very good when he collaborated with top notch musicians, whether Brazillian or American Jazz."
5,"Very relaxing and romantic, too!","This is a very nice cd for relaxing to, either with a meal or company or driving. I've never bought this style of music, but I like most kinds. I'd buy it again."
5,Antonio,A relaxing album of fine music in the Jobim style. Easy to listen to and enjoy regularly definitely worth buying.
4,This is what I think.,"The cd was good. Some of the music is before my time, but I am still ""bumpin"" it. The only thing that I really disliked was that the only titles for the tracks that was provided were for disc 1. Other than that, it is a really good cd."
3,most are good covers,"these are mostly good covers. obviously it's all opinion as to whether or not you think so as well. i especially liked the cover of ""how to disappear completely."" definitely a good purchase if it's still cheap."
1,You gotta be kidding....off with their radioheads!,"This is a joke, right? How in the name of sweet sanity can this even exist? My local High School band can do better. Retitle as ""Anyone can fail at playing Radiohead."" If there were a Supreme Court of music this would be the first to hang!"
1,If a zero star rating existed,"So disappointing. I felt manipulated. Worse yet, by fellow Radiohead fans. What a gimmick: ""Of course we'll get sales; no one recognizes our little garage band names, and they think they're getting something creatively inspired by Radiohead!"" This CD contains photos of the cover bands, as well as contact information (mostly in Southern California). It would all be justifiable if the songs were good, but they're stagnant remakes of what only Radiohead can do best."
4,I GOT THIS FOR COAL CHAMBER,I DON'T KNOW THE OTHER BANDS ON HERE & I DONT KNOW MUCH ABOUT RADIOHEAD. I GOT THIS FOR MEEGS BECAUSE I LUV COAL CHAMBER! IT DOESN'T SOUND EXACTLY LIKE COAL CHAMBER BUT ITS HEAVY! THE OTHER STUFF OK BUT MOTLY SLOWER.
2,Thank god they have previews...,"Some of the covers seemed OK, but nothing had even the remote feel of Radiohead. Creep stood out as a particularly bad example of how to properly cover a song. I am seriously glad I decided to listen to the previews before I dropped my cash down for this. I am a serious lover/collector of cover works, and Radiohead is by far one of my all-time favorite bands, but I would have to recommend you wait for it to pop up in your local used store if you have the urge to own everything with the word ""Radiohead"" in it."
3,Pass it up,"With a generous selection of recordings of FALSTAFF available, (including, I imagine, a few budget-priced ones) I wonder why Naxos decided to contribute this rather superfuluous issue instead of turning to more unfamiliar repertoire. This set does not do justice to Verdi's comic masterpiece. In the title role, Domenico Trimarchi is rather awful: constantly wobbly of tone, and with lines delivered in a scratchy parlando rather than suavely and cantabile. Worst of all, he doesn't sound the least bit fat. Needless to say, a FALSTAFF that lacks a good Falstaff is not really worth getting. Pass this one up."
5,Very useful idea,"If you have a favorite Bible to read or take to study and work in it, this is the trick to make life easier. Indexed bibles are hard to read the tabs and even though these do stick out a bit, they are much quicker to see and hold down to get to your desired reading. Takes a little time to install correctly and care must be given to alignments but it is well worth the touble."
2,I read this BOOK! HOLY MIKE!!!,"How Like a God, really does have an interesting premise, thats the reason I read this book.I thought it would be interesting to see how the power of a God would effect a regular human. What would he do with it? How will it change him?Although this book attempts to take on these issues, it just seems like the are all half hearted attempts. Ultimately this book leaves one feeling unsatisfied.It is also worth commenting that the books dialouge is so silly and child like at times, it appears that the author simply is attempting her hand at some form of satire. The character repeatedly yells "" Holy Mackerel "", and my personal Favorite "" Holy Mike!""Although there are some interesting themes in this book, I just dont think it is worth the time to read it."
3,Good premise -- uneven execution,"The premise -- being able to control reality through will -- is very interesting. However, the writing style is very uneven, many of the characters are flat, the dialogue get repetitive and the plotting could have been improved. I kept reading it to see how it would end, but I didn't really enjoy it after the first fifty pages."
2,Belongs in the pages of a comic book.,"Had this book been released by Image comics, with dramatic and colorful artwork done by someone like Todd McFarlane, then it would have gotten my enthusiastic vote. As it turns out, the author cropped down on the details and popped out the story in a book that was similar to an RL Stein GOOSEBUMPS novel in length. It was too rused and the characters has too much of a comic book attitude. Had she spent more time and made a bit more of a serious effort, the book could have been something to keep in the personal archives for years to come. As it turns out, it was only kind of interesting, kind of disappointing, and I was glad to get the two dollars back for it when I returned it to the used book store."
2,"Good premise, terrible execution","In brief- I thought the dialogue was stilted (How many times can do they say 'Holy Mike!' in each chapter?), and major plot points were rushed and unrealistic. I found it doubtful that Rob would have had such a sudden and incredibly drastic reaction to his powers (ie, running away to New York), nor did I understand the point of his being a bum. Gilgamesh, Barbarossa, Julianne- all the characters were totally flat. The only reason I stayed through was for the intriguing concept."
3,Broken within a few days.,"I bought this watch and wore it for 2 days. It broke in the first day. I was walking into a building and it hit the door frame. It didn't hit very hard, just a little and the whole side of it broke off. I didn't rate it any lower because obviously some of the fault was mine since I hit it against something, but for the price, it didn't hold up very well."
1,POS,"This ""fossil"" watch was opened on Christmas Day by my future daugher-in-law. After wearing it for oh, say, two hours, the pins holding the links together were popping out of their respective holes."
3,"Nice collection, but uneven in quality","These stories are very loosely based on the 'cities' concept. I obtained a copy just to be able to read Miville's _The Tain_, which was worth it. DiFilippo's novella is great as well. Moorcock's story is only barely readable, but the story's sprinkled with an interesting collection of up-to-date political quotation. The editing is okay, and Crowther's introduction is short but succinct. Worth its price for the first two stories, and you could consider the other two as bonus material."
1,usless,The spare battery is usless. it was swollen and would not take a charge at all. case is attractive but not worth the purchase without the battery.
4,Bride in Blue,"A good girl always minds her father, right? Well, this good girl isn't going to sleep with her step-father, so she runs away to her much older boyfriend. Soon, she becomes pregnaunt. Unfortunately, the boyfriend dies and his family insists she marries her boyfriend's brother so the baby can have it's father's name. Everything is great--the girl doesn't have to do anything save for have the baby and then she can raise it or leave the family to raise it. But the brother starts to show her--in his rough way--that he loves her. She doesn't realize what he's trying to say until after she loses her boyfriend's baby and becomes pregnaunt with her husband's baby. When she fears she's about to lose his baby also, the girl realizes that some things are meant to be...and some aren't."
3,Japanese Spears: Polearms and Their Use in Old Japan,This is well written and researched. Provides extensive information on Japanese spears/polearms but its utility is greatly limited by absence of the names/time periods and signatures of spear makers. The names of smiths and the kanji for their names would make this book steller.
5,Soul out the ying yang,"Superb outing from a passel of soul immortals, produced by that ace producer, Joe Henry...a highly accomplished artist his own self...this is his what? 4th or 5th smash production...and the artists, from Ann Peebles to Allen Toussaint to Billy Preston (and including several others) all really shine...not to be missed."
3,Eh.,"All in all, it's interesting enough if you're a fan of the supernatural, and it's the right price... however, the picture quality isn't that great (I didn't expect it to be pristine, so this wasn't a major problem for me) and the sound leaves something to be desired. There *are* some decent stories here, and the UFO section is rather interesting, but if you don't have more than a passing interest in the occult, I'd pass on this one."
5,Best Bluegrass Sound in Florida,"Sand Mountain Boys are at the heart of Bluegrass even though their from Florida. I had the chance to see Lynwood and James in person in Eleazer, NC the other day and they have brough the Sand Mountain Sound with them. And their still strong as ever with the new boys from Misty Vally. Good luck to them on the Hay Hollar Label"
5,Simply the best!,"I live in Phoenix, Arizona, and I have a rock front/backyard. When it rains there are always weeds and weeds grow near the plants that have are part of the irrigation system. This stuff has been working perfect. I highly recommend. It kills all grass/weeds I have sprayed it on thus far."
1,Round up Weed and Grass Killer,I am sure it would have been fine. But it arrived with the entire bottle leaking all over the plastic etc. It was a waste.Thank you
1,Expensive and non effective,This product needs to be doubled or tripled in recommended concentration ($$) in order to kill weeds. Otherwise the sprayed weeds just slow down a bit then keep growing. Better products are available.
3,Kind of out of date.,"This book needs to be updated! It is a good book and good idea, but it needs references to things that kids of today can understand."
2,disappointed,Purchased this to read to a class to kick off a budgeting unit. Lacks color and too wordy for my needs. Returned it!
4,A great first lesson in economics,"Here in Virginia, one of our 1st grade Standards of Learning concerns identifying and understanding concepts of economic resources. This is a great book to illustrate these concepts in a way accessible to young children."
3,Valuable lesson to be had,"This book is a little dated (you can tell when they start talking about prices of things) but it teaches valuable lessons about money management. Not just for kids, I think many adults could stand to learn these lessons as well."
3,Disappointingly slow,I love the book! It is brand new and will be a great addition to my library. My only complaint is that it took a lot longer than expected for me to receive the product. I purchased it to use during a lesson I was teaching and it didn't arrive until a week after I had already taught it. When I contacted the seller they were fast in responding back that it had sold out and would ship as soon as possible.
2,EXTREMELY DISSAPPOINTED,"We downloaded this book for a school project for my son. We had no issue with the story. It was wonderful. The problem was that the book downloaded so small we were barely able to read it. I called amazon for help. The gentleman that I spoke to was very nice, but unable to resolve the problem. I am so disappioonted to have spent $12.00 on a book my son can't really use. I will NEVER download another book from here again. A waste of time and a huge waste of money!!"
3,Unusual,"A weird collection of short stories--some interesting, some make you think a while, and a couple you may not understand."
3,Kindle Edition only,You cannot change the line spacing or typeface on this ebook. If only Amazon would put this in the descriptions...
5,Luscious cards,These beautiful cards are printed on heavy card stock. Each is a wonderful piece of art a la Wolf Erlbruch's pleasing aesthetics. A bonus - you can send one of each and still have a complete set to enjoy. Set comes in a wooden box suitable for other treasures after the cards are gone. Fabulous gift item or exquisite note cards for personal use!
4,Full of ideas,"Full of ideas with beautifully illustrated examples. I am just a beginner ""scrapper"" and have found this very useful and ""idea"" provocing."
3,Good if you want to journal...,I was disappointed because I just wanted simple page layout ideas. This is a great book of ideas if you want to journal on every page you make. NOT me!
4,Scrapbooking Eveyday Moments,Lots of great layouts to make. Super fast shipping. Would recommend this product to others.
3,Bionaut - 'Lubricate Your Living-Room' (Matador),"To avoid any possible confusion, this is NOT the Boston space rock ensemble Architectural Metaphor's side project. This is a completely different recording artist. Looks to be the band's most recent of four(4) titles. This is decent techno-electronica. Out of this CD's eighteen tracks, I liked the moving ""Lush Life Electronica"", ""Bruder Easy"", the somewhat inspiring ""Wild Horse Annie Herself"" and the beautifully done done ""Blue&Green"" the best. Might appeal to fans of Mike Ink, Kraftwerk, Stardate 1973 and Mouse On Mars."
3,Great for parents and kids,"I didn't expect much originality. All of the previews for the movie demonstrated that this was a hodgepodge of other populer superhero or recent children's books/films. The previews were largely correct.What I didn't expect was to be entertained, and even surprised at the interesting twist.For originality, the movie doesn't score high. That's not to say that everything is obviously copied, but it does borrow heavily from existing material. But for wholesome fun and that ""enjoyability"" factor, it scored better.This is a perfect movie for its intended audience - and probably their parents too. They'll love it."
4,Sky High Entertainment,"OK, I admit it. I am a fan of superhero movies! This was a good one. Not perfect... it is too predictable. However, the kid actors are great. Kurt Russell seemed a bit wooden to me, but the other adults did a great job, and really seemed to be enjoying themselves. A prime example is ""Coach Boomer,"" Bruce Campbell. You'll recognize a lot of other faces here.My wife and daughter loved this movie too. Our daughter is four, now, and was scared during some of the more intense moments. It is rated PG for some violence. No swearing or sex, of course. This is Disney, after all.So, all in all a really enjoyable movie. I hope to see a sequel."
5,THIS IS THE BEST DVD EVER!!!,"I got this DVD for Christmas and I think everyone should get it!First of all, it is a great movie. And second of all, this DVD is packed with amazing bonus features!The DVD includes the following bonus features:-Super Bloopers-Alternate Opening-Behind-the-Scenes Featurette-Behind-the-Scenes Featurette on the Incredible Stunts of the Movie-""I Melt With You"" Music Video Performed by Bowling for SoupThe bloopers are hilarious and the alternate opening is amazing!The music video is also awesome! YOU HAVE TO GET THIS!!!"
5,This movie was great,"It had lots of action, and a good bit of comedy. No boring drama at all.My favorite character is Warren Peace. I like him because his power was cool. I told my Mom that if I was to be one of the characters, I would be Warren.I'm age 6. Even though this movie is a ""PG"", I didn't find it scary. (A two-year-old would, though.)"
3,It's both good and bad,"Sky High is like a typical teen high school movie plus all the super powers. It has its good scenes and some pretty bad ones. Some of the action sequences look like they can out of an episode of Mighty Mophine Power Rangers. On a plus side the supporting cast is the best part. Bruce Campbell and Lynda Carter - genious. Though a little predictable for adults, it's still cute."
1,Sky High DVD,"DVD will not play on other DVD Players, only one out of 3. Nothing mentioned in relation to Region etc when advertised. Not worth the hassle of having to pay postage etc to return."
3,only ok,it was kinda dumb it feels like they were just trying to beat someother superhero movies before they can even come out too theatres but sky high is only ok i think the incredibles was maybe a bit better but the incredibles wasn't that great either.
4,Predictable yet Entertaining,"Will Stronghold is the son of the most famous superhero couple in the world. There are strong expectations for him at Sky High, but Will is worried since he doesn't seem to exhibit super powers like his peers. How is he to measure up to his classmates?With fantasy, sci-fi and super-hero films becoming very popular nowadays, it's no surprise that Sky High is part of the next installment. Pre-teens and young ones will definitely enjoy this movie: it has all the classic elements of high school conflict but with superpowers. A keeper for the kids collection."
4,Sky High as The Incredibles live-action adventure!,"Sky High is a movie that has it's own super-hero adventure. Will is the son of legendary superheroes Commander and Jestream, who doesn't ""EXACTLY"" know his super-powers. The movie and stars itself must have been working so hard to make a good movie.Disney... You really made good films!"
4,All-Star Cast!...and humor that is fun for all ages.,"If you love comic books, Kids in the Hall, or Super Troopers...you must watch this movie. I've got 4 words why you need to own this movie:Ron Wilson...BUS DRIVER!Forget Kurt Russell!Look for great supporting roles filled by Kids in the Hall veterans Dave Foley and Kevin McDonald, as well as Kevin Heffernan of Super Troopers/Broken Lizard fame, and don't forget THE MAN HIMSELF...Bruce Campbell!...MUCH better than Bruce's one-minute cameos in Spiderman 1 & 2! (take note Sam Raimi!)P.S. Watch the Special Features and look for outtakes of young Will Stronghold...this actor is so weird that you feel embarrased to watch his ""screw-ups"", and I can't believe they didn't cut it out of the DVD Special Features.P.P.S. Almost as good as The Incredibles and that's a bold statement.P.P.P.S. Look for a tribute to The Toxic Avenger!"
4,Way Better Than I Thought!,"I saw this movie with pretty low expectations and it blew them away! This is a very good movie! Kurt Russell was in some Disney superhero movies in the late 70's and this is a kind of a modern version of one of them! The story is overall good and yes it is somewhat predictable, yet I was drawn in by some of the characters and to their lives. I felt some of their struggle.Yet at the same time this movie does not try to be serious at all and that is the fun of it!Very funny and engaging and wholesome family fun! Check out the DVD for more extras etc. I hope I'm not a sidekick!"
2,"totally predictable, start to finish","This movie is one cliche after another. If you happen to like that, then maybe you'll enjoy the movie. But trust me... it's nowhere near as good as The Incredibles, from which it obviously borrows shamelessly. If you like shows about kids with powers, you'd be FAR better off downloading NARUTO, which is awesome!"
1,BBBBOOOOOORRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNGGGGG!,"This movie is just not worth watching. Who cares about kids with powers that go to a special school? Well, if you are a fan of superheroes, this movie is for you. However, if you are not a fan of superheroes ,like me, don't see this movie."
4,a new take on heroes,Always loved comic books and here's a live action one! Great cast and humorous story.
4,Entertaining film,"One could consider this a kind of Disney-ified version of X-Men, with less angst and death, and more of highschool teen drama and the like. It's not the greatest movie ever, but it is not without its merits and is entertaining.The idea of a high-school for superheroes is a cool one. The superhero-sidekick dichotomy is also interesting, and makes for some interesting conflicts. This movie is more like a comic-book, instead of the more serious and realistic note that the X-Men movies took on, but that's what I liked about this movie. The ending is a bit of a surprise but is also fun to watch, with a few revelations along the way. Overall a fun and light super-hero flick."
3,Fun for kids!,This movie is predictable but my young son likes it. This story is about super hero kids with special powers. It has some fun special effects and a positive message for young children. It is a safe movie for children and has some cute moments.
5,One of the best family films made in years!!,"Great family movies can be hard to find. Sky High has a rare combination of humor, action, and plot. Sky High also addressed issues around family, the struggles that a teen will face in high school. Any one looking for a great family film this is the one. I would love it if Disney would make a series of sequels, after all this was just their freshman year. Sky High is light, fun, and depicts morals and values (once again something many films are seriously lacking). Sky High is fun for all ages; personally I prefer it to the Harry Potter films for family entertainment. I highly recommend this movie. If you want a clean, safe movie for the family you won't be disappointed!!!"
4,Great family flick (but cheezy in spots & predictable),"This comedy had everyone in our family laughing most of the way through it. Kids loved it because all the 'stars' of this movie had super powers...each one was unique. So it made for dazzling (if not cheezy) extra effects. My seven year old loved this movie...he would give it a five star. For adults it was good, but you can predict the plot throughout...so it's not very imaginative...but for a family flick it's really good."
5,kids love it,it is a good family movie. I like it and also good for the kids. always looking for movies I will want to watch too. to spend time with kids
5,Just have to like this one,"Some action, intrugue, and humor. Overall a very good kids movie that the parents can sit through and enjoy as well. Good acting and a good storyline that keeps you involved to the end. Highly recommended for just about anyone."
4,We really like this video,"yes, it is far fetched, but it is clean, funny, and didn't any of you ever dream about becoming a super hero. My kids and I like to watch it."
3,Quite Good,"My main reason for having purchased this was two of the cast members. - Bruce C and Kurt R.It's a good movie for family. - Would've preferred there to be more of a battle sequence within the city, but it worked out quite well all in all."
3,DISAPPOINTED!,"THE FRONT OF THE CARD IS GREAT! JUST WHAT I WANTED - SOCCER - SOCCER AND MORE SOCCER - OUR WHOLE FAMILY PLAYS! HOWEVER, NOTHING WRITTEN INSIDE LIKE ""MERRY CHRISTMAS"" AND NO INDICATION ANYWHERE ON THE CARD WHERE MADE ETC...I HAD PEOPLE ASK IF I MADE THEM MYSELF. DISAPPOINTED! AND THEY WERE NOT CHEAP!"
1,"Trite, reheated","Lamest rip-off band I've heard in awhile. Not an original thought here. And although the fiddle-playing might be competent, the singing is horrible. So tone-deaf, it sounds like an American Idol spoof."
2,The good and the bad,"First thing to say is my order took about 10 days to arrive but that's normal with these kinds of vendors. Once I received the box, I was surprised at how much was there. Two full bags. But in each bag half was unusable and I had to throw away. What was usable was good but not great quality. I tend to judge things by how much pleasure I derive from them so my bottom line is out of the $15 I spent I have gotten about $3 worth of enjoyment out of the basil and when I'm done it will be around $5. If this is a must have and there is no other way to get it, one should order this way by all means. I will not again."
3,"Good resource, challenging","I had this book for a master's course in project management and leading change. It's not practical but I'm not sure it's meant to be. Mostly a justification for the authors' consulting practice, but some good idea starters here for those who are involved with changing organizations. Not particularly well written, so prepare for some rough sledding."
3,A little disappointed,"It is shorter and thinner than I had hoped. The 2 inch measurement includes the necklace loop. The quality of the cross and the silver seem fine, but the size is not what I thought it might be. I bought this as a gift for someone else to wear on the outside of their shirt, but it is way too small and thin for that. It would be fine worn inside next to body, but too small for outer wear."
4,I Want More!,"I had never heard of Deborah Cox until a local radio station started playing her September in the Rain. I really enjoyed it and her voice is a little reminiscent of Billie Holliday on that song. I think Ms. Cox does a great job on this CD and her voice rivals and surpasses many of the current ""jazz singers"". I hope she will consider recording more of the old standards on future CDs."
2,What A Difference A Legend Makes,"A rich canon as Washington's deserves homage by an artist who will comprehend the aesthete...here, big voiced, bland R&B one-maybe-two-hit wonder Cox wheezes her way through intricate melodies she'll never understand as if this were Jazz week on American Idol. Her vacuous, anonymous vocals bring nothing refreshing or even new; they just limp along in languid reinterpretation, always singing just below the accurate note and leaving no stain to call her own. Who does she think she is, Cassandra Wilson? My grade: C+"
4,Not just for kids,"I purchased the book for my 10-year old daughter. She happens to like books with a little more bite than a Nancy Drew story. After she devoured it,I picked it up myself to read and was pleasantly entertained by it. I can't claim to have loved every story, but each story did leave me with a sense of just watching an old Twilight Zone episode (which I loved as a kid).These are not stories filled with blood and gore, but stories that leave you feeling somewhat unnerved rather than disgusted."
5,Every star deserved,"A great time for horror fan and readers alike. Chilling and a twist on every page. The writing was smooth, and the plot only got better, a must have."
5,The watch to wear,I purchased one of those about 10 years ago. It worked flawless until I had a bike accident and the watch got pretty banged up. I didn't even have to think about it: I just bought the exact same model again. I used to spend quite a bit of money for different models and changed watches quite a bit. This SEIKO changed that bad habit of mine.I used to have a Breitling that spend more time in the repair shop than at my wrist. This watch is pretty much maintenance free and looks just as good as the one that cost over 20 times as much :)
5,Flightmaster.,This is a very nice watch. Very smooth chronograph. The Lum. glows very bright too. And the bracelet is well made. And its heavy. Not too heavy. But it feels solid. Like u are wearing a quality watch. Also its rated to 200m. Which is amazing in a flight watch. That depth is normally reserved for diver watches. It has so many features. It does it all. I can not believe this much value can be had under $1000. If u r considering it. Take my advice. This watch is the real deal.
4,seiko flight chronograph,"Bought this at Macy's for $500 and it was worth it. Its a beautiful heavy watch that I have enjoyed for about 3.5 years now. The face will scratch if you hit it hard enough and sand and grit can get under the rotating bezel if you arent careful, but it hasnt affected the operation of the watch in any way. If you treat it like a piece of jewelry it will last forever, I kind of treat my things like theyre swissarmy knives. It still works just as good but it doesnt quite look as good as it did. I meant to give the watch 5stars and I cant change it now for some reason but it does deserve 5. (the sand eventually ground away and the bezel rotates just as smoothly as it ever did)"
4,Seiko flight alarm,Pros:- It is very good watch and got lot of features.- The price offered by amazon is very attractive when I bought it. 130 bugs is a good deal for this watchCons:- Bit bulky and heavy.
2,Hardlex Crystal,Wore the watch three times and the crystal is already scratched. I had a Tissot with a saphire crystal for four years with not one scratch on the lens. I'm angry I wasted $250 on this watch.
2,Looks good but.....,"I didn't realize it when I ordered this that it runs on a battery.......I do not recommend any battery powered watches. My fault for not doing the research, but I returned this watch."
2,Watch actually received from Amazon,"The watch actually received had problems that do not appear on the same watch as seen in retail stores. I would have returned the watch except that the band had already been 'sized' since it was a gift.The STOPWATCH minute hand on my watch cannot be set at zero. It is about a half of a click off (either plus, or minus) at the start and then appears to be dead-on at the 30 minute mark but is actually reading a minute high. Even the ALARM minute hand does not seem to 'line up' exactly on the minutes at various positions on the dial."
3,Error in Description,"I brought this watch from Amazon and returned it because it does NOT have a push-buton clasp as stated in the listing. It has a foldover safety clasp. I realize that this may be a distinction without a difference for many, but for me it was a dealbreaker. The really infortunate thing is that Amazon charged me a fee for the return even though their listing is incorrect."
2,not what I expected.. and not in a good way,"I bought this watch for my bf as a valentines day gift. Just received it today. Through amazon I read many good reviews for this watch and the picture shown on here is amazing looking. When I opened the box I saw that the case for this watch is incredibly cheap looking - and worse, this ones broken!! The presentation is just awful. I know two or three hundred dollars is not too expensive but it definitely deserves more than this. The watch itself can't compare to the picture display on here. Very dissapointed... I'll give it to my bf and let him decide whether we should return it."
3,Not so much of a star to me,The reason I didnt like it:1. I wear my watch on my right wrist. The buttons becomes annoying when you are driving.2. The alarm needs to be fixed every time. Thats just not easy to do. Especially the process you have to go through to fix the alarm time.3. The look and feel is great but the realistic value of the watch is not there compared to the offering.Overall a B+
4,Seiko Flight Watch,"I found this watch to be somewhat functional but very classy. I find it hard to use the slide bezel in flight, the numbers are hard to quickly identify; and solving equasions are better done with a paper E6-B than this product. As a ground unit I found it to be very handy but many features are overkill. This unit is very sharp looking but has some work to do in the handyness department with real world flying."
5,Great watch but....,"The watch is perfect...very heavy...looks amazing...my only complaint is that when I received it, you could tell that someone had it before and that it had been returned because the tag was off and laying in the small plastic bag that also included the extra links in case you needed to make the band bigger...which I did...but disappointed that the ""pegs"" didn't come with it...that cost $5.00 per peg from jewelry store. Other than that, great product."
3,A Birthday Gift,"Let me start with the basics:1. The price and the quality of the watch are great. I feel like it was a great value for the quality.2. The company shipped the watch SUPER fast. I had it sooner than they promised which was great!Overall I would have given this company and this product 5 stars.The downside. Unfortunately there was an issue with the alarm button. It was stuck and wouldn't move, so we returned it. The response from the company was swift and no questions asked. The issue I had, was communication became non-existent. I had to call and write to find out where my watch was.I asked for a replacement - and what they did wass ship it out to Seiko to check,instead of sending me a REPLACEMENT. This was a birthday gift that I had to wait over a month to get back.In the end, the watch is fine and the birthday boy is happy. That glitch in communication and deciding to send it for repairs lowers my rating. It would have been faster for me to get a refund and reorder the watch."
5,One of my favorites,"I've had this watch for about a year now, and I have lots of good things to say. First, I'll start with the negatives. The crystal is moderately easy to scratch, I would recommend replacing with a sapphire crystal. Secondly, the metal band becomes scratched by writing (I'm a lefty who wears his watch on his left hand while writing). I would imagine this wouldn't be a problem if you don't use the hand you wear your watch on to write, but the band does get scratched. I think it gives it character, but some may find it annoying. That's all I have to say on the negatives.It keeps great time, has a nice weight to it, is quite flashy, and being a seiko, legendary durability and accuracy. My watch gains about two seconds a month, which isn't so bad at all. The chronograph function is bang on, and even the small dials are easy to read. It's one of my favorite watches, easy."
3,Nice watch but face is a little small for me.,"Very nice watch but had to give it 3 stars for the face size. Claims 42mm, but it appears more like 40mm. Had it been 43-44mm this watch would be a lot more appealing."
4,Manual bigger than my car manual,"I bought this watch for my hubby and he wears it all the time. He told me to give it a 4 star rating because you really have to read the manual to get all the functions to work. He is a real handy kind of guy that can fix, build and install anything. Over all it looks great and works very well. Buy it you won't regret your purchase!!!"
5,A must have?,"I decided it was time for a new watch and this one caught my eye right off the bat, it's probably that gorgeous yellow second hand, which sweeps somewhere between your standard tick and a smooth Rolex. The band is in fact duel toned as was mentioned by others and its rather shiney. Oddly enough, after I bought this watch I found that I had book marked this watch twice a few years back. It was definitely meant to be. You won't be disappointed. But at the same time I'd rather you didn't buy this watch so then there will be less people with this exquisite timepiece and I'll be all that more original. The price is better elsewhere right now, google it.Well worth the money!"
3,Great reliable watch,"I got this watch because I love flight watches and I really wanted to get a Breitling but found out it costs more than I thought so I go this instead to satisfy my urge and my wallet. It looks great and similar to the Navitimer but like ten times less?! There is another similar watch that Seiko makes that also has the world time, so you might want to get that instead but the extra LCD display kind of ruins the classical face for me. The only downside to getting this is that there is really cool technology out there by Seiko and Citizen that eliminates the use of the watch battery, basically you never have to change the battery again. That is really cool as cracking open the watch every year or two cannot be good and not to mention extra costs. Kudos for you, bad for the watch repair guy."
4,Very nice quality watch but with a warranty concern,"I must first say that I am extremely happy with the design and quality feel of the watch. Really the only concern I have is that the warranty card was not filled out by the seller. According to SEIKO the card must be filled out with watch s/n and case s/n as well as the merchant identifier. The case s/n was not available, nor was the store information... I would assume by this, there is no warranty."
5,Great Piece of Jewelry,"This watch is the best value for the price. Its size and weight are ideal. It has the feel of a Breitling or Rolex and gets just as much attention. I've had the watch for less than a week and I have been turning heads every where I go. People have been asking me where I purchased the watch or how much did it cost. Since it is reasonably priced I am reluctant to tell them since it is easily accessible and I do not want people that I know with the same watch as myself. I would highly recommend this watch to anyone who has an ounce of style or class when it comes to their wrist wear. The different functions, I must admit are not necessary for me on a daily basis and I will probably never use anything except the alarm (maybe). But the gauges are cool to have. All in all it is an exceptional piece, all I need is a G5 to match!!"
4,great watch!,"I am writing this after using the watch for over an year. This is a steal for the price I paid(235$).Pros :excellent build(shining steel, scratch proof glass)real good water resistantexcellent stopwatchCons :heavy and fat(thickness is 12mms)Other than the above Seiko watches are always very well known for their technology, craftmanship and build quality. So highly reccommended"
3,Watch not received,"I ordered my watch on the 12 of January, it is now the 14th of February and I have not received the watch. In tracking the delivery, I can only get the following information.Detailed Results:Into Foreign Customs, January 22, 2010, 6:43 pm, SPAINArrived Abroad, January 22, 2010, 6:43 pm, SPAINIt is now 23 days since the item is said to have been received by customs in Spain.UnfortunatelyI will have to file a claim for the non receipt of the watch.Thank youMark Smith"
3,Kissing book in review,This book was ok for entertainment purposes but lacked useful advice. I would not recommend this book for anyone who really wants to know about kissing.
2,Very limited appeal,"This book COULD serve a purpose, but only for those who have not yet kissed and/or are under the age of 15 or so. For those, the general information contained in this book, while a bit old-fashioned and repetitive, could be of some use.For others, however, it will accomplish little. Almost all of the ""special"" kisses contained in the book are either already widely practiced or self-explanatory and useless. ""What is a surprise kiss?"" ""It's when you are surprised by a kiss."" ""What is a grudge kiss?"" ""Its when you kiss someone else after being cheated on."" These are not new kisses, they're simply kisses grafted on to outside circumstances.The advice tends to be constant repetition that boys should slow down, focus more on lip-only kissing, and try to be romantic. Girls should make it clear to the boys that they like that they are interested in kissing them.Hopefully that saved you a few dollars."
4,Dickens Amazes Again,"This book is very good. I especially liked the boy's name, ""Britain"". I reccommend this to any fan of Charles Dickens. And if you aren't a fan of Charles Dickens, chances are you'll still like it."
2,Liars Lying About Lies,"We find in this book the important -sounding observation that lying is a ""present violation of the nature of speech."" This nugget from a book that defends a vast tradition that invented casuistry itself. That is rich. This is a prima facie embarrassment. But it appears recently that Catholics have become worried about their very famous proximity to diplomatic fudging of all sorts. Thus Robert George has recently come out against ""Lying"" as if it is a big moral deduction. All the organizations he has been involved with are founded on casuistry. Thus it is the purest falderal for him to present himself as an arbiter of proper decorum on the issue, not to even speak of morality. Those connected with him in his efforts are guilty of exactly these kind of falsehoods. Of course they think they have the higher ground, but their tactics prove otherwise. Methinks the woman protests too much."
5,Great addition to the farm,This is a must have addition to the farm set!!! The turkey and goose are the cutest things that I have ever seen!!
2,Only has one real use as a resource,It's good to have on your shelf if you want to show people what is a farse and what isn't as far as the Cherokee language is concerned.
4,A gift for Danielle,My niece Danielle was very pleased to receive this atomizer as a gift ( I included Danielle perfume).I would have liked to see Danielle written across the front.
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT WHAT WE'RE USE TO.","I always look forward to any new Burke novel, and especially a Dave Robicheaux story. I was somewhat diappointed in this one however. It started with the sudden death of one of the characters that we've become familar with over the years. It was presented so matter of factly, that I had to go back to the Amazon book list to see if I might have missed one of the books in the series. (I didn't) Other usual characters were just in the book as a mention only, and not pertinent to the plot for the most part. I know the main character has to evolve, but this direction was unexpected. The plot and work done by Dave and Cletus to get to the conclusion was disjointed and the book didn't seem to have a flow to it. I DID enjoy the book, but it wasn't up to the standard that we expect from Burke."
3,Reread Black Cherry Blues,"Dark, unrelenting, hopeless - the overly abundant descriptions of Acadian weather are foils for Robicheaux's mood. Not much is going well in his life. But that doesn't necessarily make a story bad - just much darker than the previous installments. It isn't even poor because the conclusion is obvious from the start. Uncharacteristic of Burke, the story lacks soul. The characters are ambivalent. One can't even decide whether to be violent. The descriptions of weather replace the humor, observations and philosophy that enriched previous accounts. In fact, Robicheaux has a major life event which isn't developed at all. Maybe true to life, Robicheaux has become jaded and faded, but it doesn't make for interesting reading."
2,Much ado about nothing,"This book was convoluted rather than complex and felt tediously disjointed and forced. Dave R.'s life and character has taken on too great of a change to be believable, especially considering that the significant shaping events happened off stage after the last book with no segue. I finished it in the hopes that it would improve but alas, that never did happen."
2,So Disappointed,"I have read all the Dave Robicheaux novels and have enjoyed them very much. This one, however, was disappointing. Burke's ability to richly evoke sounds, smells, colors, moods, and his ear for speach especially dialect remain unsurpassed. But the story line in this book is so disjointed and difficult to follow and understand as to ruin the novel. It is tedious to read and many of the characters are almost cartoon like and quite unbelivable.What a pity.This is one Robicheaux that I will not pass on nor recomend with enthusiasm to others ."
2,Hard to read -- easy to sum up,"Here is the Reader's Digest version of ""Last Car to Elysian Fields"":Dave Robicheaux -- reformed drunk, broken man, and bourgeois-hating cop -- wanders around Louisiana in a funk, obsessing about a tragic blues artist from a bygone era, doing inexplicable things that sometimes seem to be related to police work, annoying everyone he encounters, getting people killed, and nearly getting himself killed. Finally, after most of the characters in the book kill each other off, it ends and he spends Christmas in the Florida Keys with his grown daughter who comes home from college.Burke's prose is atmospheric and well-done and everyone seems to be enamored of it. Sadly, thats not enough to save this ponderous foot-dragger. No one seemed to notice that it was a dull story that plodded on in spite of almost everything its main character did -- which wasn't much. Sorry, but I can't recommend it."
1,Disappointment,"I am a huge Burke fan. I have read them all, some a couple of times. BUT, this book was horrible. I started skimming the usual plush, rich, time/mood/place descriptions. Then I started skimming the anti-Bush, Farenheit 911 stuff. Then I started skimming the dacquiry seller as satan stuff. Then I started skimming the corporation as satan stuff. Then I was done with an uninteresting book. I still love Clete though. The opera embarrassment of the mafia guy was horrible--not good. Plus, hasn't Burke written these characters and story lines at least 10 times? If I'm going to reread the same stories, I'll go back to reread the first 5 or so in the series. OUTSTANDING. Gritty, hard, evocative, moody, dark, southern and quotable. Makes you want a po boy and dirty rice. Please go back podna, this way ain't forward."
4,Burke stirs the senses!,I love Burke' s colorful descriptions of people and the Louisiana countryside. He is a master of putting you right in the location where the action is!
3,Too many trops.,"James Lee Burke is one of my favorite writers. What I didn't like about Last Car to Elysian Fields is the repetitiveness. It's almost like he made great use of ""Control C"" and ""Control V"" to move huge segments of background, etc. from earlier novels to this one. The landscape descriptions are almost identical.Characters: His REALLY BAD GUYS are pretty much the same. The dress alike and always have a hot wife or girlfriend. Clete never ages. He can kick anyone's butt without getting hurt, and even if he does, he's a quick healer.Bayou Teche, long-necked Jax, sno-cones, po-boys, are but a few of the genuine trops used in the book. Maybe after an author is as successful as Burke, he/she gets lazy (ala James Patterson), and just cranks out a few hundred pages for the dough. An artist wouldn't do that, but who I am to judge?"
5,James Lee Burke in Top Form,"No doubt, James Lee Burke entertains his readers. This is especially true in Last Car to Elysian Fields. I highly recommend this one"
3,Don't Look Here for Fast Pace,"""Last Car"" is enjoyable but you have to put aside the standard mystery - thriller structure and just sit back and enjoy the ride. And by ""ride"" I mean a slow trip in a quiet canoe through the still waters of a swamp. The plot drifts and meanders, with Robicheaux moving things along ever so gently. What I'll call the Max Call sections generated the most jolt and suspense but the various other threads of this multi-dimensional plot never quite packed the punch until the end, which takes some time to reach. Some beautiful James Lee Burke descriptions provide the glue and there's no doubt where the ""action"" takes place, but if you're looking for a feeling of tension and excitement, this might not be the ticket."
1,Beware the audio book version!,"I gave my dad the unabridged audio book version of ""Last Car to Elysian Fields"" for Christmas. He was excited, because James Lee Burke is one of his favorite authors. But he's given up trying to get through this book -- the Cajun accent the reader adopts is so thick it's too much of a struggle for him to understand. Dad had some trouble with the last Burke audio book, but this one (same reader) is worse."
1,"Loved the book, hated the reading","This review refers to the Audio-book. I'm a huge James Lee Burke fan, but I found the reading of this book to be unbearable. I have listened to Mark Hammer read before and have enjoyed his renditions of other authors like Elmore Leonard, but here he just sounds tired, sloppy and unconvincing as a Cajun reader. His performance is unidimensional and lacks any variety. When he attempts to mimic a southern accent it sounds like someone from Detroit imitating Gomer Pyle. Towards the end of the reading, it sounded like he needed to clear his throat. If you want to hear a stellar reading, try another James Lee Burke work ""Purple Cane Road"" read by Will Patton."
5,Excellent!!! Interesting Way of Reporting the Story!!!!,"This book is completely written with the only first hand accounts. In selected locations the author, Eric Hammel, describes or rather makes sense of what is said. This book is written by many members of 3/26 marines, Kilo, India, Lima and Mike Companies, describe the events near Con Thien in Sept. 1967. This book goes very well along with the book, ""Lima-6"" by Dick Camp. If you like first hand accounts in the words of those actually there, then this is the book for you!!!! I highly recommend this book!!!! You won't want to put the book down once you start reading it."
1,who cares about c murder,looks like no matter how many people tell the miller family no one wants to hear their cd's anymore somehow we still get crappy music from master p or his retarded crack head siblings.
5,Working Elegance!,"Picked this little gem up for my husband's Birthday ;-) He really likes it. The watch is very good looking, easy to read, and comfortable. Different color then in the photo. Its a silver stainless steel not the pretty color in photo, however it is quite good looking:-)"
3,Wrong Weight!!,"The bar is 6' long but it only weighs 30lbs, please correct as it may really confuse people trying to get the right weights to go with the product."
3,Not too bad,"Not a bad bar, the only issue is the spring clips that they used. Those are total junk, and will not hold the plates in place"
1,terrible!!!,This is a forein made cheap bar. there is a 45 degree weld in the corner where the weight plates should sit tight against the collar. This lets the plate flop back and forth. There are a lot of better options.
5,See above rating.,The five stars say it all. (Why do I need fourteen more words to submit a review when the first six says everything that's necessary?)
4,nice labels,great labels for addressing but I use them for labeling my home made chapsticks. The only thing is it doesn't stick as well on the chap stick containers is I believe it should.
2,Kind of a disappointment,"My 3 year old niece had fun with it for almost 15 minutes, then it really lost her interest. The glow in the dark pen was hard for her to use as well."
3,"Great Plug-in, Mediocre Filter","These replacement filters are the all-purpose ones designed to go into the Febreze True Air plug-in. There are three unscented carbon filters to a package, along with three of the timer bubble packs. These filters will do a reasonable job for about six weeks of continuous use. If you want to get the most performance out of the Febreze True Air, go for the Hamilton Beach filters labeled for smokers or pet owners, those work much more effectively and last longer."
1,get what you pay for - beware of one seller,"when you purchase these very overpriced replacement filters at what you think is a bargain price from the ""Buy-it now-store,"" what you're getting is a very poorly constructed knock off that doesn't fit well in the fan unit. They cause be more effort and inconvenience when trying to use them. First, they should not advertise these as the OEM branded item and second it they're going to knock them off, they should at least make sure that they're a reasonable duplicate of the original."
3,Does the job,"It helps out a little in the kitchen to get ride of the odors, but still a window opened up is needed. Never tried an air purifier, so can't compare.For the price it does an okay job."
3,Carbon Filter,Work to clean out ordor from preious homeowner whom was a smoker.Carpets filled with smaell.Carbon filter unit did the trick
3,ummm...no blu ray?,"Although the Bruins winning the cup solved most of the problems in the world that affect me, I do recall watching these games in HD so why can't the games be available in HD?"
4,Boston Bruins - 2011 Stanley Cup Champs,This DVD set is awesome. But it could be improved with the addition of highlights from the Divisional Series #1 against Montreal. Don't forget that the Bruins lost the first 2 games at home and came back to win in Game 7 on Nathan Horton's overtime goal . And they then exacted their revenge of the 2010 2nd round win by the Flyers by sweeping their old pals from Philly. The first team in NHL postseason history to win three Game #7s on their way to hoisting the Holy Grail. This 5-DVD box set is still a must have for EVERY BOSTON BRUINS fan!Bob W. - lifelong Boston Bruins fan...
3,Where's Marchand?,"After an exhausting 2010-11 season and an even more heart-pounding playoff run with, what, 3 game sevens (including one overtime win against the Canadiens!) and THIS is the best they could come up with? I mean, yeah, it's great to watch ANYTHING relating to the B's championship but the fact that they absolutely blew through the regular season and didn't include many of the hard hits let alone the fanTAStic fights was bad enough but... where's Brad Marchand? Next to Timmy, he was pretty much the face of the Cup complete with Sedin sister poundings and ""creative"" play all around. No interview, nothing!Also, I long for the highlight films of yore when they actually showed linear footage and gave you a sense of time and order. Not this one I'm afraid, it suffers from the short-attention span tendencies of today.Of course, if you were following the Bruins all season this DVD is STILL a must have, it just could have been SOOO much better!"
2,I'm waiting for Blu-Ray,It makes no sense not to put this one out on Blu-Ray. I'm sure it will be made somewhere in mexico for about a dime then sold for $29.99 in the U.S.
3,pretty good.,"But they sure left out all of the biting, diving and hack play that the Vandiver Canookies employed to embarrass themselves as they lost to the B's."
3,A bit disappointed .,"I was disappointed with this DVD. There wasn't much inside the locker room stuff. They could have spent more time on each of the games in all of the series. It seemed like they glossed over a lot of stuff. I think they might have shown Thomas' famous save of the year, but only showed it once in real time. At one point, I hadn't even realized they were showing a different game in the series (I think it was the Tampa Bay series).The player and sports writer/announcer interviews were pretty good."
4,Go B's,"Lots of fun re-living a tremendous season. Photo's and articles were well written. Along with the video's available, this was great to keep for the memories."
3,Confused but Satisfied,"I still can't tell what makes this version the Special Edition. It only has the games won by the Bruins in the finals against Vancouver and Game 7 against Tampa Bay. I'm happy I can watch these games whenever I want, but I bought this edition because I thought maybe it had behind the scenes looks or all games the Bruins won throughout the Playoffs. I was expecting more out of this DVD set so if the regular edition has all of these games then I would suggest you save your money and buy that version instead of this one. Still I am satisfied with my purchase to a degree."
5,Gorgeous!,This shoe is really beautiful. The line compliments your ankle and there is a slight sparkle. Also there is a bit of elastic hidden in the back to make even such an artistic design really comfortable with a secure fit. Totally worth it.
3,Just use a simple spiral journal,"I bought this product to use for recording maintenance for my new truck. With the three other previous good reviews, I thought it must be pretty good.While the book would be good for someone who needs to track mileage and fuel use (for business and tax purposes), it isn't that good for just keeping track of maintenance. In the book that was sent to me, there were only five pages to record maintenance data. I'd use up those five pages in the first three years.In the end, I just bought a hard side, spiral journal from staples that was on clearance for two bucks."
1,Horrible,"We ordered 4 of these to use for a small work function, and 2 of the 4 worked for about 15 minutes. The other 2 would not push the chocoloate thru the auger at all. By 30 minutes, all 4 augers were inoperable. We cleaned them off and added more oil to already tempered chocolate, hoping even thinner chocolate would help, but no luck. We ended up pulling the fountain part off, turning off the auger and using them as mini crock pots to keep the chocolate warm. I do not recommend this product!"
2,Looks can be deceiving,"This was one beautiful party kitchen appliance. The stainless steel looks amazing. The size was perfect. Only one big flaw. The motor was way, way, too loud. The constant ""whrr whrr whrr"" could not be overlooked. We returned it."
1,Garbage,"The first time I used this item, I used Ghirardelli Baking Chips. I had to add a lot of oil to get any kind of sheeting which made the chocolate taste horrible. The second time, I spent a lot of money on professional fountain chocolate (Sephra brand) with a high cocoa butter content. The results weren't much better. It seems that there are two possible problems with the design of this fountain. Either the chocolate isn't kept hot enough or the auger doesn't ""pump"" fast enough. The melted chocolate seemed to be coming out of the top of the fountain very well. It looks runny enough and sheets down the top shaft nicely. But by the time it gets to the first ""fall"", it seems to be running way too slow to form a continuous sheet. By the time it falls from the last level, it's just dripping."
1,Died on first use,I had one of these units for couple of years and never got around to using it until tonight. Mine wasn't stainless-steel but looked otherwise idenitcal. As with some of the other reviews mine died after about an hours use. Off to fine something more reliable.
1,TOOOOOooooooooo LOUD,"I love the concept of a chocolate fountain, but not this model. It is hard to level and get to flow properly (which is probably a common thing with these fountains). The biggest problem is the noise. I would compare it to about as loud as an electric mixer. We used this once and it is so loud you cannot have a conversation above the noise. It is a great party idea, but too loud to use. I'm going to look into buying another brand with a quieter motor."
1,"Pretty, but poor quality!","I purchased 2 of these for home use. 1 stopped working midway through (about 1 1/2 hours) on it's first use during my halloween party. The 2nd took a dump the following night. I used belgian chocolate with a high cocoa butter content as they say this is optimal and caramel in the other. The heater doesn't keep the chocolate warm enough to keep it flowing properly. I wouldn't buy one of these again. I have just purchased a Sephra fountain. More money? Yes, about $200 EA, but they are a better grade. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Not what I expected,"The chocolate fountain came yesterday, and I am sending it back today. It looks terrific. The stainless steel finish is nice, seems very sturdy, not cheap-looking, etc. Everything was fine until I turned it on! The noise was ridiculous--a high-pitched ""heee-aaah-heee-aaah"" that just pulsates as the auger turns. I thought I might not have it leveled, so I fiddled with that, but no difference. I took off the auger and tower, and with just the motor turning all I got was this loud noise. So sadly, I am returning this one and have now ordered a more expensive version that promises a ""whisper-quiet"" motor!"
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK !!!,"I didn't expect great things from this machine, considering the price.But I did expect at least the very minimum. I bought 2 because I knew I was hostessing 3 baby showers this year & thought it would be really nice to have 1 machine flowing milk chocolate & a 2nd flowing white, with a nice tiered arrangment filled with fresh strawberrys & assorted fruit. Maybe a tier of nice cookies...WOW I was so dissapointed the 1st time I used them, what a nightmare! They don't flow smoothly at all,one of them malfunctions badly & the 2nd is not much better! I even tried them at the 2nd baby shower thinking maybe I was being unfair or had done something wrong??? Nope exact same horror! Clean-up is not a good or easy thing either! I have packed them up & they are going back! For that 3rd shower I will dip my own strawberries & make a pretty arrangment, stress & clean-up on that will be much much less! I am so frustrated over the machines I hate that I even have to give them 1 star."
3,"Nice product, noise is a problem though !!",We had a great time with this fountain at a holiday party we had. The only problem is the noise the motor makes. If you have a large party with lots of noise in the room it is not a problem. If your entertaining a smaller group of people though the noise is very evident and you will only want to run it for a short time. Does work as advertised.
5,Mom's Favorite,Light and refreshing. My 89 year old mother feels special when using this product after her shower. She has received it for the last 30 years and is now a tradition.
3,not sure,"The powder container is different than other previous oscar dusting containers. I have bought lots over the years and this looks different, the smell of the powder seems to be off a bit. Hope this isn't a rip off. Beware!"
1,I am so dissapointed with service... ((((,"I was very dissapointed with the service... The product case was broken, scratched.... And box seems was opened before, there wasnt original packing tape...."
4,Cover for Baby,"This cover was very well made and long enough to use for the next few months. I like the weight of the fabric and that a little hat was included. I would have liked a strap of some sort attached to the elastic to make it easier to connect behind the baby's head. This causes the carrier to fall easily if there isn't enough space to connect it. It washes well, is great for air conditioned places and rolls up easily to fit into the baby bag."
4,A real page turner!,"I was suprised by this book, in a good way. If your from New York you gotta check it out"
1,el junko,"The DVD player works half the time, if you are lucky....when it gets warmed up, the dvd stops playing. I just use it to play cd's now...I will junk it when I buy a more expensive model from a competitor."
1,unwatchable. . . a horror!,"Bad acting, worse directing, and a lousy script torpedo this deservedly obscure indie film that looks as if it were filmed in an outhouse. Stephen Neave is especially bad in a ""performance"" that's highly derivative of Al Pacino's acting techniques. The movie is about a party that seems to go on and on and on. The guests appear to be trapped. I kept waiting for some murders to happen. Alas, none ever do!I would advise you to purchase this dvd only if you need an object to toss into the fireplace some chilly winter evening. You would at least have the pleasure of watching it burn to a cinder."
2,Lacks illumination,"I ordered this halogen lamp to replace an existing one of different manufacturer. Shipping was good, Price was good. Quality of the product and its fabrication is high quality. No problem to install. The brushed steel finish is attractive.Lamp comes with a 35 watt bulb. This illumination is insufficient for any situation. Work around would seem to be simple, ""buy another bulb of a higher wattage."" But do note that a sticker on the lamp advises, "" Do not exceed 35 watts."""
5,Constantly Challenging,"My kids, who are 18 and 20, have tournaments against each other with this game and they have a blast!"
5,Tetris Attack,"THIS GAME IS THE BEST GAME EVER (next to Shanghai of course). This game is so much fun and very addictive. My Brother (31) and I (28) have competitions whenever we are on the same side of the US and I we have so much fun. It really depends on hand-eye soordination and fast thinking. Even the one player modes are excellent. This is definitely the best version of Tetris. It may look like a kids game, but it is perfect for adults."
1,1yr and 1/2 and it died,"Just a little bit after expiration of warranty the unit died, dvd player stopped working."
5,Love this DVD/VCR Set Enough to Purchase One More!,"I am very happy with this purchase! Both the DVD and VCR picture image are crystal clear...when pressing Play, the movie comes on immediately (unlike the Sony DVD/VCR combo I have, which simply refuses to play when the ""Play"" button is pushed, and comes on in its own good time, even after bringing it in to a Sony dealer for repair). I like its Fast Forward and Rewind functions on a DVD movie in that it is unlike the chapter & title still frames which move frame by frame on most DVDs, and more like the old VHS tapes which ""flow"" when moving back and forth. I find it to be a really good set, well worth the (quite reasonable) price. Actually, I like it so much I am buying another one as well."
1,"JVc, the J must stand for Junk","Not only was this defective from Day 1, JVC Customer service did not answer the phone for many days. Their customer service center wanted $75 for a diagnostic. Keep in mind that the cost of the item was $99. The original tape in the machine does not eject. I will never buy any JVC product again. Bad product, bad service."
1,Worse home electronic device I've ever owned,"This unit is horrible! It takes forever to eject a DVD when commanded, it's excessively slow to switch to another chapter when you command skip between chapters, it won't read home-burned double -layer DVDs (!@#$!), etc. I would steer clear of this unit. I'm so incensed at how bad this product is that I won't EVER buy another JVC product of any sort."
2,Not good for the home movie-maker,"I bought this because I needed a replacement for my old Lasonic, and I was disappointed. I tend to make a lot of my own home-made DVDs, and unfortunately this unit did not play them (although it claimed that it did DVD+RW) so it was not suitable to my purposes."
5,Chancho's Favorite..,Our Bull Terrier Loves these ...We have tried the rawhide chew sticks & there is just no comparison to the pigskin twists. He'll have these when he's just chillin or to wind down before he takes a nap.
3,Packaging,"I buy these all the time for our dogs. The cost wasn't any cheaper than walmart and the packaging was torn open when I got it, so the bones almost seemed stale. Don't think I'll order these online again if I can get the at walmart."
2,smelly :/,"these thing smell obnoxiously bad. my dogs eat pig skin twist of a different brand all the time, they smell unpleasant but these things are just nasty."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I emailed customer service and asked if the treats were filled with sweet potato, and they assured me that they'd checked with the manufacturer and confirmed that they did in fact have a sweet potato center. However, the ones I received did not and I feel like I was lied to by customer service because they didn't want to take the time to actually check into it."
3,Under the Big Tent,"Big Tent Revival has consistently been one of the hardest-working bands around, and their live shows reflect a seasoned choreography of agendas--there's no front-running or posturing, just straight-up rock 'n roll. Steve Wiggins' voice is not the greatest on wax, but he's perfect in the workmanlike context that BTR seems to always project. The songs here, as on every live collection, will be familar to fans, and even if you're not a fan, there's some hefty brand equity in track No. 4, W.W.J.D. This is a good listen for long-term fans of faith-based rock, and a suitable intro for newcomers to the genre as well."
1,None but the bored,"Started this book with the best intentions but found it too slow, with stilted unrealistic dialogue and characters that I felt like slapping, not relating to or feeling sympathy for. The author had obviously carried out extensive and meticulous research for the book however it was a great pity that she decide to include ALL of it in the novel, along with every possible historical figure of the period. It's a novel, not a history text and the over abundance of historical research included detracts from the narrative. I found myself skipping pages and pages in order to try to move the novel along."
3,"sorry, but wrong product for my 01 Pathy","Did not use, but not costly enough to return :( this harness plug is not meant for the 01 Pathfinder like mine with the factory Bose system that has an amplifier and you're wanting to use it with the repl head unit. PAC makes an adapter for about $35 that gives adjustable gain screws and with these same plugs to do the interconnect, but respects the amp! I installed the re-cond Kenwood CD-tuner-USB face with the PAC and it sounds awesome using the Bose amp - definitely do that."
3,It's okay,"I got the chatnow for Christmas and I also got this too. Mine had a radio on it though. It doesn't tell what station you are on which stinks! But anyway, this feature is okay except the ear bud kept falling out. You have to sit and put it in exactly right or something like that. It's okay, a bit pricey but not to outragious. I would only pay five bucks for this."
5,just what I was hoping for,"I've been using speakers under my pillow for quite a while, but I was using speakers that were made to wear on your ears, they had a hook that holds them on your ear and they cover your ear. They were not made to be used under your pillow. However, they worked so long as I had them under the pillow directly where my ear was on the pillow. Anyway, I've been wanting to try some real pillow speakers and this one had pretty good reviews. Well, it works perfectly for me. Now I don't have to keep reaching under my pillow and moving the earphone every time I change position. I can hear clearly and there is no tin(niness) to the sound. I listen to audiobooks and that helps me to go to sleep. It comes with a DVD, but I haven't listened to it, so I can't comment on that."
4,I love it!,"I purchased a ""pillow speaker"" a couple of weeks ago and it was terrible. It was one mono speaker attached to a 3/4"" jack and would not get loud enough to hear throug my pillow. This pillowsonic stereo speaker however is much better! It's stereo for one and way loud enough also. To be realistic though, the sound is somewhat muffled. The way to get around this is to set your equilizer, if you have one, with higher mids and lower the bass. I use the ""bass reducer"" setting on iTunes and it sounds great!"
4,Well made but some difficult in use,"It is a good quality product. To listen thru the pillow takes a higher volume than I was comfortable with and moving your head can leave the sound behind.Under the pillow case only was better for me. Sleeping on my side made it more difficult. On my side, I found placing my ear directly over one speaker worked best. Takes some practice and getting used to, but it should work for most people."
1,Pillow Speakers,"These were supposed to be digital? Looks like analog speakers to me. The cord is so short, you better have a night stand pushed up close to the bed and the playback device on the edge for the speakers to be under your pillow. Sound carries to the other side of the room, hardly private to the person laying on the pillow, BIG disappointment."
4,PillowSonic Pillow Speaker.,"I really like the product, sometimes I have to reposition it depending on where my head is on the pillow, but I can hear it clearly."
4,Pillow Speaker,Just what we needed. My wife likes to listen to netflix movies thru her PC near her nightstand as she goes to sleep and this does just what it needs to.
3,Pillow Speakers,"Speakers work so-so. Then need a powerful source so an iPod won't power them very well. Otherwise, they work ok."
5,Pillow Speaker!,"I love this speaker! I put it either under or on top of my pillow and it plays loudly enough that I can hear it, but it doesn't disturb my husband. It is far better than the little plastic mono speakers I have purchased in stores. I'm very happy with my purchase!"
2,Poor quality,"I bought two of these, one each for my wife and myself. Within a few weeks, one of her speakers died and then a few months later, both speakers in mine quit altogether.I am also a Spiritual Life Coach and initially recommended these for clients in my practice, but won't direct people to buy something that won't last.I think it's a good idea. I am going to explore other similar products under a different brand."
3,low volume,"Even at the highest volume on my iPad, these speakers are hardly audible when placed under my pillow. I use them for audi books not music so I have to be able to hear the words. Now I just place it on the nightstand and use it like a regular speaker, which defeats the point. I wish I could return it but I already dumped the package. It does hav a nice long cord, for what it is worth."
2,No sweet spot,The speaker was either too quiet for me to hear or so loud it woke my girlfriend. It was also too bulky to be comfortable.
5,Awesomeness,"I use this in bed,on road trips, Everywhere. My sister recommended this because I wake during the night and my partner cannot hear a thing!"
2,"Works as advertised, good product","Very good product, good sound. Only improvement I'd suggest is a volume control inline approx 6-8 inches from the speaker casing. Otherwise, a good buy.Right after I rated this the little wire broke and you can't solder it. Just bending did it. Too weak....look for something else"
3,Tin sound,was excited to get these but its hard to keep them in place and they sound like the music is coming from a tin can.
4,Wouldn't be without it!,"I absolutely love this pillow speaker! This is the second one I've purchased, as I wore out the first one after several years. My wife doesn't want to hear music while drifting off to sleep, so this speaker allows me to fall asleep to soft music every night and not disturb her. This speaker is an essential item when traveling!I just ordered a second one for my son so I don't have to hear his music blaring when he goes to bed."
4,Pillow speaker!,I love these! I use for my Hemi-Sync CD's at night. Ther are so easy as you don't have anything to cause external discomfort while your trying to sleep. I also use for my pt's when I provide them with Music Therapy along when I do Acupuncture. Wonderful results.
2,did not work for me,"This speaker requires way too much power to be driven to acceptable audio levels. The power required is more than most battery operated devices can produce. It might work well with AC powered devices, but there is just not enough volume for it to be effective. I returned it using the generous return priveleges of Amazon. Thanks Amazon, or I would have been stuck with an unacceptable product."
1,Not Happy,Well this one was another of my hopes that did not materialize. It works but the sound wasn't very good and I had to put the volume up high to hear it. Then my wife could also hear it. So it's in my maybe I will use someday box of junk.
4,Works Great,"As someone who sleeps with the tv on, I really like it. My husband can't hear it at all so I don't bother him while he is trying to sleep."
4,Love it!,"I would recommend this product - I use it to play nature sounds (ocean, steam, waterfall, etc) to help me sleep. I love the fact that the speakers are not ""built in"" to a pillow - makes it easy to take along when traveling! Works well for me."
1,Horrible Speakers,"I purchased this item while on the road for a conference looking to use it for music and not disturb the person I was sharing a hotel room with. I got the package, started my music and hear it relativity well. I was excited, slipped the speaker under the pillow and BAM, no sound. I couldn't hear a thing. I really pressed my ear into the pillow and was able to hear a little bit of the music, but a regular position lying in the bed produced nothing I could hear. I've already sent this back an gotten a refund, save your money!"
5,works grest,"I've tried them all including Radio Shack,and Sharper Image!! This is by far the best pillow speaker yet."
1,Not worth a cent,"This thing sounded like crap just held near the ear. Under a pillow it was unusable under any circumstance. Further, while I was unhappy with the audio, my wife said she could still hear it as an annoying noise that would keep her awake. Had to send it back."
3,Too Soft,"It's pretty comfortable when tucking under the pillow. It's definitely one pillow speaker. With a little of hearing loss and tinnitus, it's a little too soft for me. I have the volume to the highest setting. My wife can hear a little on max volume. I can only hear real good when I am sleeping on the side. My other ear still rings when I sleep on the side. When I lay straight, I can't hardly hear it. I like the cushion cover as it space out evenly on the pillow and less tendency for other lose pillow speaker running underneath. Cord is long enough to run to the night stand. I am back to use foam ear phone for subliminal music. For a nice sutler music on the background, it's a good purchase. I guess if you have good hearing, this is a good buy. For me with some hearing loss, the speaker is way too soft for me."
1,Doesn't work well,"Raise your head from the pillow and hear the music. Lay your head on the pillow and the music disappears. The speakers are muted by any pressure on them. I previously owned a small, hard shelled, flattened oval pillow speaker from Sharper Image. It worked perfectly, but is no longer available. This softer version, I think, is unsatisfactory."
1,Sorry I purchaed this....,"I purchaed this Pillowsonic Stereo Pillow speaker to use with a sound machine. I researched and found that the sound machine I purchased was compatible with this pillow speaker. I plugged the pillow speaker into the sound machine and sound is so faint, you can barely hear it--even with the sound machine turned up to maximum. I would have fared far better to have purchased a cheap headset, disassembled it and stuck it in my pillow. I CANNOT recommend this product for use with a sound machine. I haven't tried it with an MP3 player IPod yet but am hoping the results will be better...."
2,great shipping time,product has really poor sound quality even if you have the speaker place directly under your ear
4,Wonerful sleep aid for both of us.,"My husband has a hard time getting to sleep without music or some sort of low noise. Noise/music keeps me awake. He bought a headset that allows him to listen to TV without bothering me. However, he would have to wait 30 minutes or so to come to bed/turn the TV off before he could go to sleep.I got him this for Christmas last year. The only time I ever hear anything is when his pillow slips. The volume is so low it doesn't wake me up. If I happen to wake up due to something else, I just wake him and ask him (gently) to fix his pillow. lolI bought him a new one this year because the cord got pulled out accidentally. The thing is, now I want one and my 14yo wants one as well!"
3,Its ok,"Its ok. Nothing special. The sound is little weird because so much of it is blocked by the pillow. The sound quality also depends on the pillow. If the pillow is the space-fabric the sound travels little better, while in traditional feather pillows you need to adjust the speaker's location.I also wish the cord was little bit longer. Having my iPod on the bed makes it easy for me to knock it off if I fall asleep."
5,Fit the bill,"I must not be as much of a restless sleeper as others who wear out the wires b/c I have had no hint of breakage or problems in that regard after 6 months of use. I find it to work well, to be designed well, and to be a good value for the money."
4,Helpful to drown out sounds,This item works well. I have some ringing in my ears and music coming from my pillow drowns out the ringing and helps me to me drift off to sleep. The sound quality isn't spectacular but good enough for the price and fulfills its purpose.
2,Broke Right Away,I like to listen to the radio at night but my husband doesn't so I bought this pillow speaker. One of the two speakers inside the pillow broke within the first week. The other one works fine....
1,Horribly made!! DON'T buy!!!,"I bought this thinking that all the reviewers that said the speaker(s) died just didn't take care of it and abused it so it was justified. But the one that I bought, one of the speakers stopped working the second night, and worked sporradically after that. Needless to say I returned it as soon as I could. This was a waste of maney and time. DON'T BUY IT!!!!"
5,At last!,"At last, I can go to sleep to my favorite music and not have to worry about ear phones.. just wrap my head in sound.. I love this product. And the CD that comes with it has beautiful, soothing music."
3,No Volume control,I pulled the wires out of my previous pillow speaker and was looking for a replacement. I thought these would do the job. They do have a nice sound to them but they don't have a volume control. So I constantly have to go to the player and adjust the sound.They are comfortable and you can even sleep on them if you so desire. Its only the lack of volume control that makes me less than satisfied.
2,Not so much,"I use a pillow speaker every night to help me fall asleep. My beloved Sharper Image speaker has served me well but has become frayed at the connection and is soon to die, I'm afraid. So I am searching for a replacement. This isn't it.After a few nights of use, something is going wrong with the connections ... it reminds me of when I had my headphones plugged into my Sony Sport Walkman and the connection would get all wonky and I'd have to pull the jack out and blow on it? Remember those days?Anyway, so with these, if I jiggle the pillow or my head about a bit, the connection comes back. I haven't even pulled it out to investigate, but I assume this performance means the connections are not long for this world. Poo. The search is still on for a good pillow speaker."
2,Good for about six months,"These speakers were great but after about 6 months the sound was so distorted I can not even make out the words being said in a movie from one of the two speakers. It is about year after I bought this item and the second speaker is starting to go. Given the cost and assortment of competitors, I just feel liked the company jipped me on the quality to make an extra few pennies. Plus I just don't like the idea of adding one of these guys to the landfill every year."
2,Definition of Mediocre,"Whew... I struggled to get through this book. The characters are so one-dimension, the plot is thin and the action is not exciting. It reads like a few short stories about the same characters mashed together. I guess that is what I get for reading MTG fiction..."
3,candy,"i picked wrong candy by accident, but i liked it.this is little chewy like a caramel,i wouldn't recommend if anyone doesn't want caramel like candy."
2,"Not worth buying, look elsewhere!","The description for this item sounds very appealing, but when I received it the material was very flimsy and thin. I was disappointed in this product because it sounded very promising but I do not see the pockets being very durable as they are too thin to hold a thick wallet and there is no padding if using the pockets for a cell phone. I returned this product to purchase one that has stronger material and more padding."
1,I'm disappointed,"I was so looking forward to this water bottle holder for my walks and hikes. But no one ever mentions that it can only be used as a waist pack. I prefer to carry it over the shoulder. I could not adapt the strap in any way to use it as an over the shoulder or neck mount. I finally attempted to try it as a waist pack but it was awkward and cumbersome to try to sit with it on- Imagine less so to get in to the car with the steering wheel and all. Also it is a holder with no insulation to keep liquid cold; the thinnest part of the cloth is the part around the bottle. The concept is good but it needs to have an attachment to use as a shoulder strap, so it could be appealing and useable."
2,It's OK,It was smaller than I anticipated and not made very well. You really can not fit that much in it. It does hold the bottle though...
3,worked out fine,I was a little disapointed when it arrived with no bottle (the display picture shows a bottle) but it has worked out fine.
1,Product review / feedback.,"Unfortunately, I purchased the products on 10/16/2007, but I haven't received the goods until today."
5,BLACKIE LAWLESS!!,"The guy on the cover looks a lot like the lead singer from the worlds greatest metal band, W.A.S.P. That's because it's him!! That's right, Blackie Lawless and the rest of W.A.S.P. make a cameo appearance as Satan's rock band. Sort of the official ""house band"" of Hades!! Cool Stuff / Corny Movie!! GREAT!!"
2,It gets a 2 for blackie lawless.....,"Dont let anyone fool you, this movie is bad. I took my then gf to see it when it opened all happy to see a movie with Blackie in it We were both fans We walked out I am sorry to say this movie will not bring back anything and on top of that it is really short 70 minutes or so. I think that is what upset me the most Even Blackie couldnt make this movie better. It is a shame too If you want to see him in a decent movie watch Decline of the Western Civilization 2......"
5,Awesome,What a way to get a great product. The used book I bought was in great shape and arrived on time. It's the only way to get the book you want without spending a lot.
2,Good For Doctors - Not for patients,"Beyond Aspirin may be a good book for alternative health care practitioners, but of little use to a patient who wants immediate useful information. It delves into complex metabolic chemistry and the chemical makeup of herbs, but not into how you'd go about using them on your own (with the exeception of green tea - drink lots of it, the authors tell us). They tell us how great ginger and tumeric are for reducing inflammation, but omit telling us how much fresh ginger or tumeric is useful for tonic or therapeutic dosages, and then tout the wonders of extracts of these plants. Then, they don't tell us what dosages are useful if you get extracts. If there were a companion volume to this book for civilians, it would be a great service to people who would like to experiment with their claims. As it stands, the book is incomplete."
3,Needs an update,"This book is a good resource for people that collect the M1 Garand. The Post-War Garands do not have as much written about them. While Duff has a lot of great information in this book, the edition needs to be updated with a lot of the current information that is now out there in the last few wears. Much has been learned from other collectors and from the CMP returns."
2,suitable for beginner level,"If you already use Perl for system administration you don't need this book.If you understand Perl, but are interested in learning more about system administration you might enjoy this book.If you're a sysadmin who doesn't know Perl (is there such an animal?), you should read this book.Fairly even coverage of Unix and Windows. Even a few Mac items thrown in. I was disappointed that this book didn't cover more advanced subjects."
2,Buy the cookbook or the Camel instead.,"It's a book for programmers who occasionally like to play with their Linux box at home. There is little of anything of practical use to the professional systems admin who wants to know the art of keeping an installation of Perl working, installing or maintaining modules, or how to recognize good code from bad when stealing other peoples code to hack for your own purposes.Also, not one script uses -T or -w. Buy the cookbook instead."
1,"Buy the camel and the sheep, not this....","I was very dissapointed with this book. The author flaunts a lot of vague generalities around and never proceeds to anything remotely useful on any of the platforms discussed in the book. The examples are childlike and so badly formed that one could not possibly use them as a framework, or even a thought-framework to design a real administration tool in perl.All the way through the book, I kept wondering when the author would get to something concrete. I was sorely disappointed.--joe"
1,"Way tooo complex examples, obscure topics",I was hoping for lots of short practical Unix scripts. Nope.
1,Jack Bruce City of Gold,"A piece of junk. save your money. culled from 2 performances this should have been from 1 and it should have been the whole show. instead we get a rip-off, I'm so pissed at the idiots who put this together, they ought to be sent packing to Siberia. I traded this in for something else. Don't buy this!!!!!"
5,Making Sense of America's Social Policies,"This is an excellent text that traces the historical trajectory of U.S. social policy from the Colonial period to present. It reinforces the old cliche, ""history repeats itself"" by showing that our current partisan attitudes about government and social policy are not ""new"" but are part of longly held ideologies that can be traced back to the founding of America.If you've never quite understood why Republicans and Democrats have such different ideas about social policy and the roll of government in helping its citizens, then this is an excellent source to start with."
2,get the 6th edition,"get this one if you have to, but there is a lot of new information in the 6th edition"
2,Well written propaganda,"It is well written, but the author can't for the life of him contain his intolerable hatred of the bad guys, the conservatives."
2,"An easy, but highly biased read.","Jansson's book doesn't read like most textbooks and is easy to follow. However, seldom does a more biased text come along. Jansson is clearly a liberal who feels that any Republican president or politician has no compassion for the poor or downtrodden. While throwing in a few light token criticisms of politicians like Bill Clinton, he mainly bashes Reagan, both Bushes, Newt Gingrich, etc. with opinionated claims such as positing that Ronald Reagan disliked poor people because he grew up in a family without much money and had a father who was an alcoholic. If you're looking for liberal ideology, this is your kind of book. If you want a book that explains the facts of social policy minus the irrelavant partisan opinions, look elsewhere."
3,Ok,Buy the aerosol type instead. The squeeze bottle is too uneven and much harder to apply. The aerosol evenly coats the filter. The cleaner does a good job of loosening the dirt for the pre-cleaning.
5,Easy to use,I was pleasantly surprised by how little time this took to clean my air filter. The squeeze bottle is so much easier to use than the aerosol sprays I am used to using.
3,I dislike the squeeze bottle,"In my experience with this, it is difficult to get complete coverage of the filter without over saturating the filter and wasting oil. When you put oil on the filter material and then wait for it to soak down there will frequently be white spots and pale spots that aren't as well covered. The flow can't be kept steady, and when you're done you have an oily mess.To each his own, but when I was done I wished I had gone with the aerosol."
2,Filter oil screws up intake sensors in mordern cars,"The filter itself is excellent but the filter oil caused all the intake sensors in my Mercedes and Jaguar to report errors. My older cars are fine since they don't have sensors in the intake lines. Mist a VERY THIN oil layer over the surface of the filter on the side that facing away from the intake then you will be fine. Also, misting the filter with too much oil will defeat the high flow feature of the filter."
1,If you make $2 an hour,"If you make $2 an hour then it would worth to buy and use K&N; product. It is messy, the spray bottle does not spray properly; the time it takes to dry. All in all the whole process is too much hassle.The skin of my hand is dry because of the drip from the cleaner bottle.NOT WORTH IT!"
5,K&N Recharge kit,"This is a ""must have"" for any K&N; filter or CIA kit. I even use K&N;'s kits for other ""wet"" air filters. If you want to getthe full life out of your K&N;, this kit is a must-have. Remember to follow the instructions so as to not harm the filter element when cleaning.Cheers,Lance ""Motorhead"" Lamberthttp://blogs.venturacountystar.com/motorhead/"
5,Get to cleaning your air filter!,"This filter care kit is just what you are looking for if you own a k&n filter. I clean my air filter every 5,000 miles or so. Make sure to follow the instructions so you don't hurt your filter. I have had ZERO issues with this product. The squeeze bottle works wonders if you are trying to get a line of oil into every pleat. The kit pays for itself. Recommend this to anyone looking to maintain their K&N filters."
4,Saves you money over time,You will spend money buing this initially but then you will save money over the long run by better performance and lifespan of your filter. You must remember to clean off the excess and you are good to continue until the next cleaning. This kit should last you a really long time. If you purchase a filter by this company then this is a must have. You will at some point need to clean the filter and re-oil it so I would suggest getting this item to save money. The spray works well getting into the filter and removing dirts and debris. After cleaning oil it up with the oil. It is absorbed into the filter so it can catch those fine dirt and contamination particles.
5,Excellent kit for my K&N filters,I strongly recommend this kit for those who want to bring back their K&N; filters to the original status.Easy to use and quick resluts.
4,Does the job,This product does exactly what it is supposed to do. The key with the cleaner is to knock out all the junk out of the filter before applying the cleaner. Then allow the cleaner to soak in.I applied the oil in even coats and tried to avoid over oiling the filter; so I ended up oiling it three times to get the right amount on the filter.I definitely enjoy not having a one time use filter.
4,good stuff,"not too much of work as others put it. A Must have if you use their filter. One thing the instruction said at the end that both clean and dirty sides show red evenly. I dont think you would get red to show up evenly on the clean side while you only apply oil to the dirty side, unless you risk over-oil it. With the amount of recommended oil, probably can only get 20% of clean side to show up red."
5,Have not tried it,have not try this cleaner... as my filter and car is pretty new.will try it when i hit 20k km
3,R.A.S,"R.A.Scolis reu en bon état, la livraison un peu longue mais période de fetes à prendre en compte..R.A.S"
4,"Good item, but don't buy from D2Moto. Bad Junk...","D2Moto = junky junk dealer. Been burned twice. Biggest shipper to landfills I've ever encountered. Not great about handling return requests, and prone to dealing with garbage or issue-laden products."
4,Filter Care Kit,"Good product, the cleaner is great. The oil was difficult to determine the right amount to use."
4,Worth the money,This is much chepar than the one I purchased at the store. I recommend getting this item to save money. The spray works well getting into the filter and removing dirts and debris. It is absorbed into the filter so it can catch those fine dirt and contamination particles. You will spend money buing this initially but then you will save money over the long run by better performance and lifespan of your filter. You must remember to clean off the excess and you are good to continue until the next cleaning. This kit should last you a decedntly long time. If you purchase a filter by this company then this is a must have. You will at some point need to clean the filter and re-oil it so it wont leak.
4,The final touch to our pond,"This rock kit has put he final touches on our pond, makes it look more realistic now. Very easy to install. Only thing left now, is to hide the side plastic. Nice product!"
1,CAREFUL OF THE FINE PRINT (RESTOCKING FEE!!),"Be sure to carefully measure your pond placement, I was charged almost $50 for shipping and restocking fees! You might want to shop locally where the business is customer friendly and accepts returns without RMAS and hassles.After 10 years as a loyal amazon customer, I am am now a ""local"" business supporter because they post their return policy where it is easier to see and understand. I guess amazon has gotten too big to care about my business.Just spreading the word for the rest of my life. I feel deceived and I'm going to warn future customers of the pitfalls of buying through amazon as a middleman, they might be hiding a very unfriendly return policy behind the ""a to z"" (except ""r"" for ""restocking fee"") guarentee."
4,A quirky movie with great performances by noted actors.,"The premise of the movie is very funny. Characters are well played with some very well done visuals. The actors must have had a wonderful time filming this and I would love to see the outtakes. Harry Guardino (sp) is terrific as are Eliot Gould and Eddie Albert. You really need to watch the film and follow the story line. It is comic and quirky but not to far from the truth. My favorite line is from E. Albert when talking about the military drug warfare division""...we don't want to KILL the enemy...we just want to make him a little bit sick"". Another sceen with Gould and Guardino undergoing drug testing in a lab is hilarious. See it if you have a chance, it is not available in most stores."
5,A sleeper that has been forgotten,"I truly funny, funny movie with great performances. This movie really never made it and it was very difficult to find a copy to purchase. Some of the scenes are wonderful, as is the opening scene with Gould tramping to a target. I only hope this movie is not lost in history."
1,P.U.,"I watched this movie being filmed as did pretty much everyone else in Tooele, Utah. It was exciting, like the biggest thing ever to happen in Mayberry. But when the movie came out I think we all wanted to destroy every copy made. It was just awful. We wanted to like it but it just wasn't funny. Perhaps that had something to do with the facts this movie was based on. Prior to the film, a large number of animals had been killed by a poison gas leak nearby. Maybe that memory spoiled it.However, one local extra stole the show. Paula Argus was standing in line ahead of Gould in a bank. She was truly the best thing in the movie.I own this movie simply for the nostalgia. It is a part of my personal history. Otherwise I can't think of any reason to own it, rent it or watch it."
1,Thine Ears Bleed,"This cd came with the new Singles set by Mindless Self Indulgence called 'Mark David Chapman' and I really wanted to like this album. It would be a lot more fitting if the band were called ""Thine Ears Bleed."" They are like one of those crappy bands who have no fans at all but the play as the opening band for really good bands. The guitarist sounds like he is playing the same song on every track of the cd. There is nothing appealing about the voice you hear from the singer. The drums are entirely unoriginal. This band is exactly like every band that is bad. I don't want to give an entire listen-through of this cd again and neither will you if you buy it."
2,Dissapointed,My niece didn't like this dvd as much as her other dance ones. This dvd mostly showed the girls interacting and performing but didn't really show the audience how to execute the moves and was pretty dull to watch. My 8-yr-old niece (who loooooves dance) gave up on it after a few hours and I felt so bad I had to give her her other gifts quickly to distract her from her disappointment.
2,"Pretty, but no information.","I bought Alphabook: Typeface Design and Application, thinking it would be a book about, well, typeface design and application. It's not. Instead, it's just another pretty picture book of all the funky, cool, too-hip-for-words typefaces being designed right now. Just one page after the next obviously designed to make you say, ""ooh! ahh!"" with every oh-so-funky layout. Good to have as a catalog, but offers *zero* insight on actual design."
5,Catherine de Medici,"This book is very inspiring and keeps you in the edge of your seat. Jean Plaidy writes about the life of Catherine di Medici, who was a recentful woman since she was young. It describes her life and her feelings of revenge against so many people and especially against her own family. A great book of romance but also a thriller."
5,Fun Romantic Suspense,"This was a fun, romantic suspense book with lots of action scenes and two people who really don't want to get romantic with each other but do. Recommended for those who like suspense and spy books, but also like romance."
3,A Deep Dive into Vietnam,Understanding Vietnam is an insightful but tough read. It is an adaptation of a Ph.D. dissertation and reads as such at times. The author has an excellent understanding of the role of literature and poetry in Vietnam but gets bogged in too many examples. I found myself skipping many of these in order to get to the more accessible and perhaps practical parts of the book. I found it useful in preparation for a trip to Vietnam but would not recommend it for the casual traveler.
1,Cycling Through Misery,"Someone once said that she could not decide whether this DVD was appropriate for history class or exercise. After reviewing this DVD, I can safely say that it is appropriate for neither. It may be appropriate for sleeping or getting you ready for sleep. If you are expecting a DVD that is shot from the vantage point of a bicyclist as I was, then you will be disappointed. The cycling tour guide was so bland and uninspiring that I wanted to cycle away from the cities that I was touring via DVD. I wanted to enter the dead end that she did (on purpose?). I was hoping she would be shot by the minutemen who gave a brief introduction to this ""historical"" production. Please do not waste your time or money on this DVD."
1,We know she owns a helmet...but is she awake?,"This was a good idea (bicycling and letting us know what it looks like...) but the person riding the bike sure didn't want to be there, and it shows. Very, very boring. Not worth the money, I put it on 32X speed to even get through it! Sometimes she's on the left side of the trail, sometimes the right, sometimes a helmet, sometimes not...sometimes asleep, sometimes not...Someone should have watched this DVD before it was put up for sale."
2,One-sided view of the Irish Wolfhound,"This book is great if you are total centered around dog show conformation and early US New England history of the Breed. If you are into Lure Coursing and Obedience, you will not like this book."
3,"Sure it is a fine product, but",It was too big to fit within any of our cabinet doors and wife wouldn't let me mount it where it could be seen !Anyone for fish cleaning knives in the storage area ?
4,My favorite bra,"The product was great. A little smaller than the one I bought in a department store, but still wearable.Edit: I had purchased a Nearly B last time, but this time I ordered a regular B, and they fit like a glove! These are my favorite set of bras because I can barely feel them when they're on, and they aren't padded. They definitely make my bust look natural, and my clothes can actually fit over them comfortably. It's like wearing a sports bra, they're so comfortable!"
4,Great find,"Since this bra is no longer available at the department stores in my area, I bought it here. The price was slightly more than I'm used to paying. The bra fit great and I received it quickly. I think it arrived in a week or less."
1,Disagree with other reviewers,"I did not like this bra. I did not feel that it gave me any ""lift"" at all and made me look even ""flatter"" than usual. Everyone is different I suppose, but I personally think that the Playtex 4021 Delightful Dots wire-free bra is much, much nicer."
5,the best,"I am very upset they are discontinuing this bra. As a traditional bra hater and burner (LOL), I have never been so happy. It truly feels like I am not wearing a bra! so hard to find these days."
2,Not the support I expect from Playtex,"I was looking for a bra with the support I have come to trust in playtex but without the look of support. You know, without 4 inch wide straps....Anyway, this bra was not supportive at all."
1,A good Review,"The bra came well packed, speedily and it is very like the picture and description. The fit is good."
5,Comfort and Shape,"No uncomfortable wires, slight padding for shape, microfiber feel. This is one of the best bras ever! Very comfortable and fits my small frame...finally!"
3,A Decent Bra with Little or No WOW factor...,"While I like the overall quality of the bra, I'm not sure it was exactly what I expected. The reviews made it sound as if it were natural looking with no obvious padding or shaping. The bra is basically the contoured foam type and it lends itself to odd puckering or dimpling when washed. I suppose this is my fault since I put my bras through the washing machine and then hang to dry. This one should definitely be hand washed. The bra is well made and the construction allows for an easy fit and it's comfortable. I think my disappointment lies in the fact that I expected it to be different from the other ""foamy"" bras out there. If anything, it's a close second cousin."
2,Too coned shaped,"I ordered an A cup and the contour in the front seemed too cone shaped and made that ugly empty wrinkle. I wondered if I should have ordered an AA, but I don't think it would have made a difference with the way the cup was shaped. This was my first bra purchase without the underwire and I realized that being small-chested, I need/prefer the help of a little underwire lift."
3,no more foam lining please,"This bra pretty much ""fits"" but you can't tell because the rigid foam lining covers all faults. It's OK I guess. But I'd like a bra that fits that is just soft fabric. Maybe even see through? I'm not ashamed of my small breasts, no need to disguise them or pad them. ""Thank goodness it fits"" is a good idea. It needs some tweaking."
2,very disappointing,"a collection of SCI-FI short stories , poems ext.. edited by the author conny willis.tee writings are from many genres of SCI-FI and by different writers, some are new and some are SCI-FI master from the old generation.most of the stories are very weak, and some are very peculiarthe best things about the book, is that ther reader can always skip to the next story, and mabee to find something for is taste.i think this book is realy for SCI FI fanatic fans only, especially for those who are familiar with the NEBULA award organisation, and for conny willis's fans and friends (i'm not one of them)"
2,Disappointed,"After reading all the great reviews, I must say that I was disappointed with this book. You can get the same effect by just writing in a diary every day about how you feel about the pain, what it prevents you from doing, how others responded to you, etc. I also thought it was overpriced. I returned it."
3,"Great approach, but too expensive/awkward for Kindle","I am close to accepting the mind-body treatment approach and seeing real results. This workbook is a great accompaniment to Dr. Sarno's book on Healing Back Pain. On a Kindle, though, a ""workbook"" approach really doesn't work, so I have been RECORDING my verbal responses to the daily questionnaires on my iPhone. This would actually be a great iPhone APP is someone would design it! I have been spending real $$$ on treatment (here in Japan) and I am very happy to have found an alternative cheaper approach--but still, can't figure out why this is so expensive on a Kindle--it should be $9.99. Also, hard to find on the Kindle store--as the title is ""New Title 1""?? Must be a glitch...all in all, if you are serious about using the mind-body approach, I think this is a great accompaniment, but maybe consider the hardcopy if you live in the States..."
2,Not worth the money,"Having been a convert of Dr Sarno's mind-body approach for over a year, I purchased the workbook thinking it would take me to a new level of implementing Sarno's concepts. Hardly! I found the workbook far less useful than the recommendation in Sarno's Divided Mind book and terribly overpriced for what it provided."
1,Also Disappointed,"The other review that stated you could write your thoughts in your own journal is correct. This is quite an expensive badly put together ""writing tablet"". While the idea of getting to the source of pain is good - it shouldn't cost as much as it did for something you can do on your own. This really isn't very helpful and seems like a creative way for someone to take advantage of people in pain."
4,Awareness is Key!,"Dr Sarno's book ""The Divided Mind"" led me to this workbook. I had Fibromyalgia for almost 20 years and within 2 months was 90% better. The mind truly is an amazing thing and this workbook truly brings awareness. It is very simplistic in its format, but that makes it more effective."
3,The MindBody Workbook,"I have just started to use the workbook, which is supposed to be used in 30 day program. Very interested questions are put to the reader to make him/her think about elements which might be the reason for TMS or TMS like disorders (alergy...). But what to do with answers? Can I analise them by myself? I am afraid, that something is missing here. One might expect, that in a last chapter a roadmap of disorders could be found, or maybe results of analises of answers to the same questions made by experts, that I could just put my self-diagnosis into certain group.Nevertheless I read dr. Sarno's book on TMS, I am still an amateur, not able to identify my problems. Or maybe I should write this review after 3 weeks..."
1,"Not for real serious mold makers, not even hobbyists.","This stuff must be brushed on and several thin layers built up before using mold. It take's FORever for each layer to dry. Typical mold takes 3 or 4 days to complete because of this slow cure time. If you have nothing but time and infinite patience, then this stuff is for you!"
3,One double pack that would make Harrison cringe!,"Air Force One! Typical blockbuster movie with material that everyone would've seen one time or another. The one thing that pulls it through however is the fact that they have Harrison Ford in the lead. Unfortunately, this doesn't help the Devil's Own!Are we actually meant to feel sorry for the plight of a terrorist? Even though it's a fellow country man, no-one would condone the killing of innocent people. This appears to be what Harrison's character struggles with in this movie as he has a dilema of wethering to kill Pitt or not.This movie may go down well in America due to strong Irish roots, but in Britain, where these acts of terrorism were faced on a weekly basis, it will bomb.This double pack is good value for money and I can see it going down really well with Harrison Ford fans. The sad fact is though, these two movies, just like Seven Days, Seven Nights' are designed for the cinema. Good on the big screen, wouldn't want to own them though!"
3,not as advertised,I did not use the product. It was advertised with the cooling products included. It arrived as the fan only. I called Amazon. They could not send the remaining items so I returned the fan and they immediately refunded the cost.
1,Not worth it,"I ordered this product along with another crate fan from a different manufacturer at a cheaper cost to compare. This fan definitely does not provide enough cooling power. Also, with the description being brief, I was under the impression that the ""cooling system"" came with the order. I was surprised when I did not receive it as all the photos show it with the attachment. Not worth the money, cheaper fan from another manufacturer, without the thermostatic control is definitely better."
1,Didn't work,The fan I received was broken and never worked. I ended up having to pay shipping both directions and was only refunded the purchase price.
2,Just not good enough.,"I bought two of these fans for my boxer who competes in agility trials. The trials are often outside and we live in an area where the temperatures are regularly 90-100+ degrees in the summer.I bought two fans to latch onto the crate door along with the ice pack attachments. The attachments are completely useless. The ice is melted within 10 minutes on a hot day and there is no way to refreeze them when you're out at a trial.Unfortunately, the fans aren't much better. Unless you are within a few inches of the fan, you can barely feel the air. For the same price, you can buy a 10"" table fan, set it in front of the crate door, and cool your dog down a LOT faster. Don't bother with this fan. Nice idea, bad fan."
1,Crap,This is a piece of crap...I have had my crate fan for about 1-1/2 months and it no longer works. I bought an ac adaptor and it still doesn't work!!!
5,Excellent resource for needlepoint stitches!,"Being a new needlepointer, but avid cross stitcher, this book is a valuable resource for learning new stitches and determining which stitch to use where. So glad I purchased this book."
4,nice case,"only 4 stars, cause i have never found the ""perfect"" pouch for me. i have many of custom leathercraft tool pouches/cases. decently well made. slim profile for the size of this pouch. i tend to carry a lot of crap on me, this is a nice medium sized pouch."
4,"2 years good service, getting new one to replace Velcro","2+ years of good service in the field across the nation doing power plant repair and maintenance. Mini-mag light (2xAA size), business cards, small caliper, laser penlight, cell phone - a little bit different loadout of eqpt than the other reviewers. Need to get a new one 'cause the Velcro closure is loose now. (Can't use a magnetic closure because of the welding chips)."
3,loved it and it didnt last long,somone else loved it more- (waaa) lol. Thats the danger with noce tools and pouches. Fortunatly the tools were not it it yet.
3,I should have listened to the other reviews,"I should have listened to other peoples reviews when they said it was too big. But thats not the problem, the problem is the use of space. It holds too little stuff for how big it is. Another thing I didn't like about it was the key holder, I find it too difficult to operate with one hand. About the only thing I liked was the quick attach clip that makes it easy to put on or take off."
5,"Warm, funny book","Although this is the first book I have read by this author, it won't be the last. High-Tide Bride is one of those make you feel good romances. Funny at times, thoughtful at others, it is the perfect pick-me-up read!!!!! WTG Dianne!"
5,Awesome,"This book is not only visually stunning but is great for those who are looking for, among other things, the top hotels, restuarants, and spas in Bali. Unlike other guide books, this one presents only the most important aspects of the island and its amenities so that you can decide whether to go, when to go, and where to go. If you are looking for a guide to the most luxurious Bali experience, this book seems to be the best!"
3,Decent Read for Beginners,"The book is a good read for anyone thinking about starting to study a language; it gives a bunch of very handy information about different languages, the pros and cons of each, the cultures attached to them, and how foreign language learning is increasingly essential, giving beginners a very handy overview of what they're getting into.However, aside from a few various sections which relate to any specific language, current foreign language students will find this book rather unhelpful."
3,"Ok, lots of distortion","Lots of barrel distortion for such a low power scope, although the viewing center is ok. Can't comment on accuracy."
2,"Fine for a BB gun, maybe a 22, but that is it","Pretty much a toy.If you are shooting anything bigger than a 22 or further than 50 yards you will be sorely disappointed.Great for a bb or pellet gun or maybe an airsoft, but that is probably about it."
3,meh,"crystal clear picture...until you attemp to adjust magnification. blurry as all heck and pretty much useless beyond base magnification. other than that, its durable, compact and light weight. would i recommend? eh, paint ballers, air gunners, maybe even for a .22 lr it would work well. But for anything that you will need the magnification for, nope."
1,NOT thrilled.........,"While this appears nice on the outside it has BUNK internals. After installing weaver rings, a hassle all it's own, I mounted this on my rifle and found that there was not enough UP deflection available to even get on the paper at 50 feet. Bottom line is this is CRAP."
1,4x30 compact ncstar scope,"this scope is a 1.5 x 30 at best was not clear and has no way to adjust the focus. not a good buy at all, the other scope that i purchased was just fine."
3,Smaller than i thought,I expected it to be bigger but it is only 7.5 inches and the eye hole has only a 1 inch diameter. I put it on my airsoft gun and its hard to get close enough to the scope to see through it properly because of the stock. I think it would be okay for an assault rifle or something but not a sniper rifle.
4,Awesome little scope and great price,"Let me tell you for the money these scopes are great!,I've had one on my sks for years, transfered it to my ar.Now before some scope snob has a hissy fit let me say that, ""If I wanted a 100.00+ scope I would have bought one.""I got another one of these and it works great, holds zero, and is a worthy scope when your shooting atclose to middle range.Would I buy this scope for 300 yard or more ""sniper"" shots, no. It's not what this scope is made for.But this scope has these qualities:BrightReliableNice field of viewGreat priceAlso kills squirrels great on my 10/22 (just saying)So if your looking for an inexpensive basic scope buy this puppy (save some money) and get thenc star rings as well, they work just as well as the simmons rings.and combined will get you that free ship I think"
1,Won't fit savage model 93 17hmr,"This scope isn't long enough to fit savage mod93 17hmr, I didn't do my home work before ordering! It was my fault!"
4,Great price and great buy,"The best thing about this scope is that it's nice and cheap. It was already focused very well when I got it so I didn't need to do any udjustments or anything. The crosshairs are pretty straightforward, though I wish they had tickmarks going along the entire line instead if just where they intersect. Also, You can't zoom with it, but that was to be expected. The available zoom it gives is average, but at least it stays accurate. It looks pretty, which is a nice plus. I would certainly recommend this as a cheap alternative to some of the more pricy scopes, but don't expect to do any real hardcore sniping with it."
2,get what ya pay for,"I ordered 2 of these and both got sent back because they were out of focus, the view was actually very clear but at close or long range everything was a blur, I did unscrew the eye piece until they focused but there is no locking ring to keep it in one place and by the time they did focus the eyepiece was very wobbly and probably wouldn't have stayed in after a few shots or so, if it wasn't for that they seemed sturdy and like I said earlier the view was very clear, NC needs to prefocus these before shipping them out"
2,ncstar 430b,"Not much for a hundred yard. Might be alright if it wasnt so fuzzy, the on I got was a fifty yard unit as best."
3,OK for Certain Applications,"This scope would be great for a paint ball gun, pellet gun, .22, etc. The first sample I recieved had some flaws in the lense...seller was EXCELLENT and provided replacement right away. For our applications, this scope is a good buy."
4,Great Scope for the Money,"Didn't expect too much but it has stood up to 44 mag recoil on my 1960's era Ruger carbine, take a chance!"
3,Poor focus controls,"When I opened the package, I thought it was a pretty good looking scope, but when I had to adjust the retical to suit my farsightedness, the rear adjustment ring would not turn, no matter how hard I tried to twist it, and the rear optic adjustment ring had no lock ring to set the focus, and I almost had to screw it completely out of the mount to get the cross hairs into focus..Not a good plan! I suppose the company's warantee is good, but I needed the scope to work now, and spraying WD-40 as instructed by the company representative might have worked, and could have voided the warantee, and wrecked the scope. So I opted not to follow his advice, and return it to Amazon, and they were nice enough to email me a return shipping tag! Thanks! Maybe it was just this particular scope that had this problem, so it is with any purchased item, there are good ones and some that just need a bit more work to function properly."
5,james L,"Very good for the money, clear and crisp at all distances. I use them in my boat and in my truck."
4,Works as expected,Why not give it a 5 star? With any perma focus lens you will have a blurring in close range. In this case that range is about 15 to 20 yds. After that distance your eyes will focus the binoculars to infinity. These binoculars perform with clarity and brightness. They were what I was looking for. If you want to catch the action with out adjusting the focus beyond the blurring range I recommend these binoculars.
5,excellent look ..,"precise...it's got a greak look.. I think of it as a device for measuring time & as a jewelry...the only problem is,when I clap my hands hard,the adjusting switch somehow pushes out and the part showing the day moves up or down to another day...so I dont clap my hands hard no more when I'm wearing the watch. and the price I paid for this watch was definetly a bargain"
3,Classic tear jerker,"As always, Greer Garson portrays the epitome of womanhood. She is beautiful, gracious and benevolent. Walter Pidgeon really over played his role and he usually does. They were a great team as they appeared in ""Mrs. Miniver."""
1,This MUST BE an error --- Movie was filmed in Technicolor!,"No distributor is given in the description, and this is definitely NOT a colorized film. I would beware, and purchase this only if it is a confirmed WB release, and not an illegal copy."
5,Golden Oldie.,Blossoms in the Dust (1941)Wonderful to see this old favourite return on DVD. Our Video was starting to stretch seeing my wife is a tragic for such a tear jerker.
5,A classic that was so moving!,My 93 year old aunt asked me to get this movie to watch! So glad she did! Amazing and powerful
5,Wonderful,A beautiful but sad movie at the same time. How we treated children of mothers who were unmarried was a very bad thing. Thank god somebody stood up and helped. I recomemd this movie to all parents of teenage children. It could be them
3,difficult to install,"This is a very nice fan with a very elegant appearance. It is difficult to install however, especially with the short drop rod. There is just not enough finger room between the motor housing and the shroud that goes around the ceiling mount, to start the two little screws that hold it on. And once you manage to get it started, there is not enough room to tighten them even with a stubby screwdriver. I happened to have an offset Phillips screwdriver that I use once every ten years, and it was necessary in this case. It's also very difficult to get the three little screws that hold the light assembly to the switch housing started, and a magnetic screwdriver is completely necessary. The magnetic screwdriver is also required to start the screws that hold the fan blade assemblies to the motor, and it's very difficult to get them lined up and find the holes through a very restricted little slot.The fan works fine and looks great, however."
4,Very nice Torchiere Lamps!,"The lamps came right on time, no problem there. I find the lamps to be unique and very pretty. The only problem I have with them, and it may be no problem to someone else, is that even with the lowest wattage light bulb in the lamps, they are really bright. I have even gone down to a 25 watt light bulb and they are bright. I personally like a rather low light setting in the living room as I have other lamps as well. I have one on each side of the television and I have to say that when they are on... they can bother your eyes. Not a really big problem because as I say, they are pretty. I thought they were a good price and I would do business with this company again."
3,Polemics and facts,"This is basically a compendium of data regarding Minnesota Indians as of 2006 based on 2000 census data. But, it is more than that; it is a polemic urging massive governmental support of Indians and lengthy discussions of various perceived failures of the government to live up to treaty and other legal obligations; it is a review of many legal issues affecting Indians; and it is a review of the success Indians have had in self-government. However, each area usually concludes with difficult problems facing Indian populations. Indian issues have a long and winding history. The basic conflict arises from the situation that Indians are sovereign nations but that they are dependent on the government (federal and to less extent the state) for support. The book does a fair job of demonstrating that. Discussions of Indian culture are superficial and need to be greatly expanded."
2,I just don't get it....,"I'm a big Patton, Peeping Tom, Dog Fashion Disco, etc fan. Live.fm kept popping up with the Drake Equation album. Apparently a lot of people who enjoy the music I do like Tub Ring too.For whatever reason this band just doesn't agree with me. I mean, I just don't like them. I gave them a chance. I really did. But after a while I had to face the fact that I couldn't take them anymore.It's not the worst thing I've heard. There was a WSP album I had to listen to nonstop one time because I lost a bet. That was pretty bad. And I'm not comparing these guys to WSP. I'm just saying there are worse things one can listen to.I think it's the ""soft side"" of their music. I feel like I'm listening to Cold Play or something."
4,"Wow, some off the wall *h*t!!!!!!!!","Looking for something new. This album will jerk you right out of your seat. Mike Patton fans have their own genre and this is right in the middle. Keyboards,Keyboards,Keyboards did I say crazy keyboards. Very interesting song structures. This album is very influenced by Mr. Bungle,but I don't think that has anything to do with Trey(bungle guitarist)being the producer here. The mix on the album is very raw and live sounding. It took me a few listens to accept and appreciate this recording. I can't get it out of my cd player............"
3,great music--[bad] singing,"While this band is a musical powerhouse combining elements of Mr. Bungle and other avnte-rock groups (and doing it marvellously), the singer needs a boot in the . . . He degrades the overall feel of the music and plummets the amazing musicianship into the ""local band"" arena, causing the listener to weed out the instrumentation by picking through a barrage of horribly imitated Mike-Patton-wanna-be vocal stylings. Similar to the early Dillinger Escape Plan records: if you can stomach the singing, the music is worth it."
3,No zoom??,"I am pleased with my purchase of the Kodak Easyshare printer dock, but I was surprised that the camera did not have a zoom function on it. I didn't think any camera sold these days is without a zoom function!"
2,Easy Share is Easy!,I just rec'd my Easy Share and read the instructions and started using it right away. The pictures it prints are great. Clear and Crisp. I am amazed. Very easy to use.
1,disappointing guide,"I was at first very pleased to find a guide for Southwest Ireland where I am traveling this fall. When I recieved the book I immediately looked up the places I am going to and was not happy to see how little information there was about each place that was listed. The map is a good feature, but everything else is just too short on background information."
5,Great product and fast shipping,I ordered this and didn't pay attention to the details. It said damaged box and I did not notice that (my fault). The boxes were dented but the product was perfect. I apologize for the incorrect review that I left earlier.
1,terrible service,Great product. Bad service. Chose one day shipping and did not get product till 3 days later. why pay extra for shipping speed if they dont honor it? also checked that this was a gift. they included the invoice with product price with the item and the person i got it for saw it when they opened it. thanks for nothing. beware of this seller!
5,Best Lotion There Is,This body lotion is great with a wonderful scent. Don't be mislead by the picture of Oscar cologne (Amazon needs to fix this). It really is Oscar Body Lotion (white bottle).
4,Simple and Sweet,"For those of you looking for an innocent and uplifting read, Kayla is the best place to start. The author's tender heart and love for small children is revealed through a short novel that keeps the attention and paints lovable, memorable characters. The analytical may find it too simplistic, and the author doesn't always stop to explain what's happening to those without advanced horse knowledge. However, those details don't bring down the story and the important goings on are clearly evident.I finished this book in one day and then recommended it to my roommate, who finished it just as quickly. It was almost better to listen to her laughing at the notions and antics of Kayla's daughter. I personally loved her good-hearted boss, Barnabas."
1,Disappointing Item - Would Return in An Instant,"I bought this because my toddler loves looking at other children. I was really disappointed with it based on the positive reviews it received. The photos were mostly O.K., but one was very blurry. Also, the photos lacked creativity, forethought and cuteness. It was as if the photographer just stuck a kid and a pet together for a random shot. Anyone could have taken these photos, even me! I could swear one toddler is in two of the photos --- were there not enough baby models available? If your child is intrigued with other children, especially babies, I would recommend the books by Anne Geddes. Her photographs are beautifully done and enjoyable for both parent and child."
3,Tongue in Cheek,"Although there is a need for pronunciation aids and this book gives the most thorough presentation of the issue, it still is difficult to get one's point across just by looking at the pictures of how the mouth should be formed for each sound."
3,A few additions please,"While I loved the lists, I would like to see the addition of the IPA in addition to the authors system. I would also like to see a way to add additional languages."
4,Great resource for teaching distinctions in sound,"This book is an excellent aid for students of English speech to practice the differences between similar sounds.In addition to diagrams of the positions of the tongue, lips, and teeth for making each sound, the book gives lists of words that differ only by the sound pair under consideration (dead:dud) and also sentences using such words; for instance, Our PUP has no PEP.The only issue of concern is its use of its own custom phonetic transcription rather than the International Phonetic Alphabet or other system."
4,Early days of Dallas,"Easy to read, good history on the time and location of the events. Good investigation by the author, some of the characters come alive."
5,Very Good,"Received item quickly and in condition as stated. Grew up in Ft Worth, lived in and around it for 60 yrs and have friends who knew the people in this book. Very interesting."
3,"Nice toy, but not very durable!","These toys were great for the pool, but they seem to rip and tear very easily.Otherwise my kids had fun diving for them."
4,Great fun pool toys,bought these for the public pool. The only complaint is all the other kids want to play with it to! Kids loved it and it provided lots of fun.
5,Son loves them!,"My son loves diving for the diver dudes. They are soft, yet weighted so do not hurt if it accidental hits someone. The design allows them to spin on their way down, then they stand on their heads for a short time, then fall over. This makes it a challenge for the kids. They try to get them while they are still up. The water easily drains from these guys to so it won't sit and get mildew like some water toys."
4,Not the Originals,Bear in mind that this book is a TRANSLATION into English. A translation is never exactly the same as the original.
2,It was....ok...sort of.,"It was a bit dry. There was a lot of info, but the visuals and music were distracting to the point that I had to go back and force myself to listen to the guy so I could actually understand what he was talking about. Why should I believe this guy? Where were the expert interviews?"
5,great,Just want I wanted. Came in on time and in perfect condition. Product was just as I expected. Does what it's suppose to do..
5,Hard to find at this price,"Super price, reduces the rats nest in back of the tv. Probably will order more for my family. Sure beats Mall prices."
4,Good Book,"Definetly a must read, if youre a conspiracy believer like me! Eisen covers suppressed cures for Cancer and a very good review of Tesla, a faorgotten and uncredited Scientist. I dont quite agree with the moon landing story, but Definetly worth the read and Money!"
5,Suppressed Inventions,"This is not the first book on the topic that I have read. I have always found it to be helpful to obtain information from a variaey of sources and authors, to avoid bias. The advantage,(and disadvantage,)of this book is that it gives you a brief synopsis of a variety of topics. It has a good bibliography in the back if you want to read more on the subject that interested you. In comparing the opinions of this author with other sources, I have found the information to be accurate, albeit limited in scope. I have given this book as a gift to several of my friends who are interested in exploring the topic. It serves as an excellent introductory volume. The book avoids getting into highly technical data, so it is an easy read for anyone, and with the relatively short chapters, each on an individual topic, you don't have to read it all in one sitting."
4,Great Mono Record,"Have only one speaker? No problem, it sounds the same since the whole album is mono. Great songs that really fill out the space they are limited to. I'm an audiophile and it sounds ok, can't wait for the stereo reissue if it ever comes out."
5,moving,"starflyer 59 out of this world moving melodies engrafted rock love the popinrock in.... 11,2,9,5,1,6,3,7,12,4,8,10"
3,Good Starting Point on iSCSI,"John has done a very good job of covering the basics of the iSCSI protocol. This is a good book for someone who is trying to get an introduction to this protocol. However, the material is presented from the viewpoint of someone who has NEVER actually built a storage system. For those people who are trying to either build an iSCSI system or want to get a comparison of this protocol with either Fibre Channel or Infiniband, this is not the right place to start. This is an excellent book for starters but is not good for serious iSCSI implementors."
4,Vey good book for starters,"If you are writing an iSCSI Target or an initiator or even trying to understand iSCSI protocol in general, best way is to read RFC. However, if you dont have any background (or even if u do) starting directly with RFC can be really boring and may easily disorient you (my personal experience). And this book will perfectly give that start. Of course that being said, this book cannon be an iSCSI bible, RFC would still remain the bible of iSCSI. Just give yourself a start with this book and once you have gathered enough understanding of the protocol, switch to RFC for greater detail."
3,About the protocol not applications,The author writes detai about the iSCSI protocol but doesn't talk about applcations. Get it if you're into theory but not really useful for how to use iSCSI or manage a SAN.
5,At least one song is pretty damn good!,"""Sanctuary"" is the only song from this album I have heard. I heard it played on an internet ambient station and it struck me well enough that I was compelled to come here and see if I could find it. I'll probably get the entire CD sometime soon. But the one song I have heard is pretty damned good. So there you go."
1,Web Sites Are More Accurate,"Having just returned from a ""college caravan"" trip through the Northeast with my daughter and another family, including a son, I can attest to the glaring inaccuracies in this book. They often have the times of tours and info sessions wrong. They even sometimes indicate that things are closed when they are open and vice versa.An hour or two on the Web (and then printing off the pages) will save lots of aggravation. Then give each college a call!You are going to be traveling with Fiske anyway, just pick-up a Mobil Guide, a map, and copies of the web pages.Andy Beveridge beveridg@bestweb.net"
4,This is a Number of Stories,"I bought this thinking ""Nightfliers"" was the whole book. I was wrong; it was a collection of stories, and ironically, Nightfliers was one of the weaker tales.This book has a few gems: ""Override"" and ""Weekend in a War Zone"" were fantastic!I was introduced to Martin's style through the short story ""Sandkings"" (not in this book), and this book had plenty more of his hard SF/horror style and Hitchcockian twists.I recommend this book to get an enjoyable sampling of this writing master's style."
5,Great Book!,"My husband and I don't have any kids yet, but we bought this book to read to each other. It is wonderful! Some stories are touching, some are funny, some are quite clever, and all are moral. Every story is very interesting and yet somehow manages to secretly slip in a point about being good to yourself and others. This book is thick with lots of stories, but they're all very short. We both think this is one of the most entertaining books we have ever bought."
5,Magic for returning to things we have forgotten.,"Beginning with the words of two old lullabyes for children, this collection of stories from so many corners of the world emerges gently from the times and places of their origins. Stories of depth, of substance, of value. Stories with an imagery of old to captivate the child in each of us.The quote by W. B. Yeats characterizes the way in which so many of the stories' authors reach out to the young reader (or listener): ""I have spread my dreams under your feet. Tread softly because you tread upon my dreams.""These stories are truly an opportunity to share intimately in the dreams of daring dreamers. They comprise the moral stuff to give directions in life's journey; and thus, a 'compass'.Many stories so obviously written for children; yet, some of even greater value to adults who have kept the heart of a child."
5,Great Book - Prompt Delivery,Great Book (stories that I was told as a child) - fair price with excellent shipping. Packing was excellent. William J. Bennett's series brings wisdom to the family and to the class room.
4,The big change,"Cinderella's rat is about the rats point of view in the Cinderella, before he got turned into a human. It's about him and his sister's life before all that, and in between. When he became a human, his sister was left as a rat. So he took her to a wizard, to try to turn her into a human too. After midnight he had turned back into a rat but his sister was still a human. She bought a house so him and his family lived there happily with out cats."
3,Strange version of the old story,I bought this book as a gift for the man who played the part of the rat/footman in our production of Cinderella. It was a perfect gift. I thought the story was interesting but not really a good children's story since the rat's sister ends up as a human girl with a dog's bark. I found that a bit odd and disturbing for little girls who might read the book.
4,by far the best on head jobs,"this is by far the best book/manual on head modifications. i've used it to produce approx. 350 hp out of a 225 hp stock, and that is a significant change. ( ) END"
1,BEWARE! These are not new products!!,"Hi,I ordered Bobbi Brown's body lotion and it came opened, not in a sealed box as it should, when you buy it at the local department store. I believe this company buys the ""returns"" from high-end dept. stores and re-sells them. That is why the product is never new and why a tiny bit of the product was already used. I was very disapointed with the quality of the product, as I do not find used cosmetics/fragrances hygenic.Be aware!! that is why they can sell it to you at a discounted rate!But I'd honestly want to pay the $7-$10 more, to have a clean NEW product.I will never order from them again!Best regards,M."
5,Readable,This is a very readable and helpful book for the real world. I have read many books concerning this topic and this is by far the best of the lot. Many real life examples. Thank you Dr. Zgourides for writing this book.
4,My son loved it,It was like looking at Stewie on tv! My son truly enjoyed this gift. He was thrilled to open it Christmas morning!!
1,Very disappointed,"The color of the brass was not as expected. The quality of it was poor. I returned the item for credit. Will not order another light fixture, as the photo misrepresented the item."
4,Looks great - priced right,"I purchased this as a bridge between no dining room light and plans for a more ornate fixture. The light was easy to assemble and seemed like it would be flimsy. After putting it together and hanging it, I have decided to keep it. It really looks nice and beat my very low expectations.This fixture is an excellent inexpensive lighting option."
5,Exciting! With Action and Mystery!,"Just completed reading The Treasure of Orchard Hill, and that is what it will always be to me...a treasure! It held my interest from beginning to end; was exciting, with action and mystery. And, of course, having visited the farm many times as a child, I was busy (in my mind's eye) viewing each area described, and with great curiosity, attempting to connect the characters to real persons. I loved it and I think it would be a great book for childrn, since the main character is an eleven year old girl. I believe it would certainly keep a child's interest, especially since most children love mysteries. Looking forward to your next book. Ann Craig"
4,Pleased but not a wow!,Watch a little difficult to get going due to winding method. After period of constant use now works fine. Have not figured out yet how the other button functions due to poor instructions. Overall a good watch for my needs.
3,Color or product,Could someone tell me if this product is supposed to be yellow in color? I purchased this and its yellow in color and I don't think it's working for me like everyone says. My hairdresser thinks it should be clear and maybe I received an old product.
1,shoes,The shoes arrived quickly. Unfortunately the shoes must have been seconds. Not only are they not narrow on the right shoe the one strap was sewn on incorrectly.
4,satisfactory,"I used this product on my boat bottom as soon as boat was removed from water, and still wet...The bottom had the brown slimy film on it and this product did a 'reasonable' job of removing it ...I feel the product is reasonably priced with the exception of the shipping charge...it seemed definitely over packaged..maybe because it's a chemical...I would buy it again at that price only if qualified for Amazon's free shipping policy..."
3,Great idea but...,"The idea behind this caller ID unit is really wonderful. I can just watch it go through its different patterns for hours. However there are a few things that I do not like about it. My wife and I decided to put this unit in our kitchen and we can distinctly hear the motor whirling even over the sound of the refrigerator. The buttons are not well designed and you have to push them just right to get the command input. On the positive side, the instruction book that comes with the unit is well written and very easy to follow. Installation was a snap and the unit even came with the backup batteries. It looks GREAT and is really fun to watch. I would recommend it to others as long as it is going somewhere other than a bedroom or other room that you like to have silence in."
4,Easy on the eyes,This is my mother's third Info Globe. The display is great for her failing eyes. The reason this is her thrid: An nearby lightning strike took out the first. The second one just started malfunctioning after about a year and a half.
3,Only Lasts A Year. Noisy But Cool.,"First off, It's VERY cool. It comes w/1 yr. warranty (save your proof of purchase!) or buy the 2 or 5yr replacement warranty offered by some stores (sharper image offers them).A fun item and handy thats for sure. But after a short while extremely noisy buzz/vibration that can't do much about. It gets louder with time. If that's not gonna bug you, go for it as it ""is"" a fun conversation piece. It didn't bother my husband but I couldn't stand it. My globe lasted a bit over a year."
1,Sharper Image Info Globe,"Looks like a great product, but does not work properly. Did not work at all with first attempt. After a slight bump it began to work some, it does show caller I.D. and phone numbers but we can not get the menu to work to set the date and time. The machine is stuck on a 2003 date and time. Oh well ??? seems this has been sitting in the warehouse a few years :-("
5,Coolest Caller ID EVER!!!,"I bought this CID device in 2007. It is still going strong, and everyone who enters my home is mesmerized by it. It still surprises us, too, because it displays messages we haven't seen before. For example, today is Thanksgiving. In addition to the message ""Happy Thanksgiving,"" it also scrolled ""TURKEY DAYS ARE HERE."""
4,Info Globe,Wow fast shipping. Item just as advertised. I would have given it a 5 star if it had the instructions included. Either way i'm very satisfied...works better then our last one.
5,Great item - be sure to buy the original Olympia brand,"I have 3 of these in blue, orange and purple. I made the mistake of trying to find it cheaper on Ebay and received a cheap imitation that did not work properly. Make sure you get the Olympia brand (mine came from Brookstone), and you should be very satisfied."
4,Info globes are great!,I bought this for my son-in-law after he saw mine. The alphanumerics are clear &easy to read. Saves a lot of getting up & down to check caller ID - Even has a nice greeting - we love ours! We've had it for three years and was worth every penny.
2,Rust in 3 days,I bought it b/c is says ALUMINUM - should have re-read more reviews about the rust that happens at the unit and cord junction.
3,Works but the spring rusts,"I was reading other reviews and although the heating element seems to work well the spring around the cord is terrible. It rust almost as soon as you put it in the water! What's the use of having a submersible heater when the cord covers rusts immediately! I use it for my chicken's watering bucket so I just used a pair of wire cutters & cut it right up to where the cord exits the bucket notch, works for me."
3,Stops water from freezing. Wire guard rusts,"This works well at stopping the water in a 2 gallon pail from freezing, without warming it too much and thus wasting electricity. However, as mentioned in other reviews, the wire strain relief does tend to rust. However, the chickens don't seem to mind."
1,Got nasty and stopped working,"This worked great while it worked as a way of keeping my chicken's water from freezing. I had set it inside a five gallon bucket with nipple style waterers in the bottom. After less than a month, the whole thing got rusty and corroded and stopped working. Perhaps I missed something on how to use it."
5,ANOTHER GREAT PRIMA GUIDE,"Like all that came before this is another great Strategy Guide. An easy guide for anyone to follow from us HARDCORPS MECH MANIACS to someone just looking for a bit of help with a particular tough Mission this has it all.Prima never fails to deliver, sure there are a few flaws between the book and game play but show me a Strategy Guide that's perfect.....I rest my case. No I do not have any association with Prima other than the fact that I like to spend my hard earned money wisely and they have not failed me yet.You definitely get a BANG for your buck."
3,"Good strategies and maps, poor discription of actual game","The mission section of the book was one sided and showed one way to go. Not the best route is described every time. Some times your ammount of artillary, camera drones and weight are wrong. Despite flaws, a decent book."
5,Very powerful short stories and miscellaneous goodies,"Literally could not put it down until finished (at which point this cynic burst into tears). Of course it's out of print; it could change the world by re-making one soul at a time. The really dangerous part is, it has VERY good unusual or original stories. Go on, read it; I dare ya!"
2,Not That Great...,"I picked this up for I was very excited in my new enjoyment of graphic novels, but when I read this from front to back in one day (not using that as a major complaint) I felt unfulfilled, and that I really wasted my time. The story seemed interesting but the play-out didn't do it for me, too bland and felt like it almost tried too hard.The characters were flat, the only character I felt was really evaluated on was Waldo who was interesting, but still didn't reach what I saw as the potential he had. I think that basically sums up the book, doesn't live up to its potential.Maybe it's just the change of times, and if I'd read this when it was first released, then I would've enjoyed it more, but this book really didn't do it for me."
2,Nostalgia only hurts; it never helps.,"Deitch's work was relevant in a different era, but today, it is as irrelevant as the music and silent movies he loves. It's superficially interesting, but ultimately flawed work. While he takes great care to show his knowledge of animation history, his lampooning of Walt Disney comes off as sour grapes.Buy the book if you've got the money to throw away. You'll read it once and never pick it up again. It'll end up as a thrift store donation or a 25 cent item in your garage sale.Better yet, buy something by Crumb or Spiegelman. After all these years, they're still creating fresh, engaging work, and you'll own an object that can be enjoyed with repeated readings.Ultimately, Deitch is a one trick pony. Don't walk with him down this lonely road."
3,Okay,"I waited along time for these tables to be delivered. Assembly was easy, the top of the coffee table had some deep scratches in it which could only have happened before it was packaged. I say that because of the amount of bubble wrap and packing tape used. You can't win them all."
2,3 ppc coffee tabel,i got this tabel from Moshya Home Furnishings good prise but very bad poor packing when i get that tabel corners are damage ane one leg goint is broken i used silicone to fix that now oK. but the should pack even better.
5,Much better looking in real life,"These are great tables. The seller sent them very nicely packaged with no damage at all. They are made of real, heavy wood, nothing fake or particle board. These exact same tables were about $700 in the stores I looked at. Great buy, love them."
1,Too basic,"This book is a very thin overview of the Web development process. It takes around 30 minutes to read. It is very basic material, likely only relevant to people who have never done any Web development work before. Although I question the value of spending money on any basic overview books, I would recommend The Elements of User Experience over this one."
4,Solid foundation for beginning and aspiring web designers,"This book provides a solid foundation for beginning and aspiring web designers. Covers almost all apects on web site production, but not in a detailed manner.One deficiency this book has is that it does not even mention testing for usability, which is an essential element in making professional and usable web sites and making the production and updating processes much less headaching.The book name is also deceiving. The book puts an emphasis on prodcution rather than design. No detailed descriptions on how to design in web applications like Photoshop and Dreamweaver, nor how to use CSS, DHTML, etc. However, she does mention many useful resources in the chapters as well as in the appendix.Bottom line: Get this book if you are an aspiring or beginning web designer, don't get it if you are anything more than that.For a similar but more advanced and detailed book, check out Kelly Goto's ""Web Redesign: Workflow that Works""."
2,"Star Trek, The Motionless Picture","Star Trek The Motion Picture came out as the first new Star Trek in ten years. Instead of covering new ground, it took the concepts of two Star Trek episodes and made them into a movie. It just didn't work. The movie had beautiful special effects, but the story and plot were lacking."
3,Fans only,"This movie was one of the most anticipated movies for sci-fi fans the world over. Well, assuming their particular country of residence allowed them to view the television series. I hear that certain totalitarian regimes didn't like the ideals espoused in the series. Freedom, equality etc.Sadly it turned out to be a bit of a mismash. Over produced, overly dramatic over acted. The end tried to be a bit of metaphysical showing of the development of mankind to the next level, whatever that means.This is for the fans but it is worth a look see for interest sake. It is also worth remarking that this was the first movie, hence forward was developed the 'Odd numbered Star Trek movies are best' theory. As in 'Odd Good', 'Even Bad'"
3,Very slow,"While it was very exciting to see Star Trek made into a movie, the results were less than stellar. The movie was plodding and way too long. If the movie had been edited down to 90 minutes, it would have been more enjoyable. The plot was decent but way too drawn out. The second Star Trek movie (Wrath of Khan) blows away this movie. Skip the first Star Trek movie and jump in on the second. I am a Trekker, but cannot recommend the first movie."
3,It's Not For Modern HDMI and Digital Connectons.,"I own an LG 50 inch plasma with Toslink digital out. I had to buy a DAC to use this for my ZVOX 550. When I would shut off the TV, this device got confused without a signal, and a loud hum/noise came from my ZVOX. It worked okay when the TV was on. I eventually bought the SRS HDMI sound leveler with much better results. This device is for older analog systems. It hasn't been updated for the new digital world."
3,William A Fenton,"This ""Sound Regulator"" Does just what they claim. Be sure to connect this between your Tv and the source such as the set top box for your cable or sat. I cound not get it to work between the tv and a stereo. Seemed just to much for it. Therefore only three stars."
4,excellent,"I am not sure who David Candy is but I sure do like his music.With neo-psych, I don't usually bother: so much genuine 1960s stuff lays still undiscovered, go for the real deal. But when I heard part of this album played on my beloved free-form WFMU, I bit.This cloudy music is covered by Candy's poetry, and the textures are as good as the words. If I did not know better I would swear this was straight out of 1968. Candy has a real feel for what genuine 60s psych sounds like.Get it."
1,ego-maniac,"this cd sounded like a bad soundtrack to a bad 60s b-movie.his dialogue sounds like a bad self help tape, where he helps himelf to your money. My 8 month old playing on my keyboard hits more right notes than he could. his choice of psuedo-names already belongs to a real songwriter and that is his real name. If jet-set records paid 7 digits for this they need to contACT THE REAL DAVID CANDY through me DESPERATLY."
4,An Uncommon Interdiciplinary Collection,"The book is a useful collection of paper (some long, some short) on the definition and physics behind the ""habitable zones"" around stars. While perhaps not technical enough for all applications, it's nice to finally see many of these issues discussed in one volume, instead of spread throughout many different journals and texts. The climate of such planets is covered of course, but the addition of topics such as how stellar evolution influences the habitable zone (how long is the habitable zone habitable, for instance), the implications of high planetary obliquity, and atmospheric collapse of tidally locked planets round out the presentation. While somewhat lacking in math for such a text, perhaps the biggest negative I can see is that some of the material is not as up-to-date as I would like, but in a field like this that would be hard to do even if it was annually updated."
5,I would recommend this book.,This book is excellent and a very easy read. It does a great job of breaking down the different products and their impact on the environment. There are great examples of companies that are doing their part to help reduce the negative impact on the environment.
2,Misleading,"They show blue prints, so I thought it was blue ink and that's why I purchased it--- it ends up it is black ink."
4,"Love the watch, but arrived with dead battery","Most watches ordered on the web have something to prevent them from wearing down the battery while in storage and shipping. This item did not, leaving me with a beautiful watch featuring a completely dead battery on arrival. Fifteen bucks later, I had it sized and working well with a new battery, and I have to say that it's my favorite of my watches. That said, I'm not a big spender on accessories- I have another Seiko that has a nylon band and colored face, a Movado that I bought back in my big-spender days when I was young, and a cheapo Time Expedition. That's it.I will say that this bears a fair resemblance to a Rolex Submariner, which is a nice feature if they don't look at it too closely."
4,where is the alarm,where's the alarm feature?nothing is mentioned in the instructions about an alarm featureaside from the misleading ad the watch is very nice and I still like it
2,Thanks for writing this book - Now I don't have to...,"Thanks for writing this book. In so doing you have prevented me from having to... You have also confirmed my worst fear- that despite the hype, it's impossible to make this story interesting. It's hard to create empathy for people and companies who are driven solely by greed. The protagonists of the book are snakes among snakes... and I'm not talking about the record companies... I had the pleasure of meeting and working with most of the people you discuss- some are more benign than others, although you wouldn't want to see any of them come home with your daughter... Of course there is no and should be no sympathy for the nastiness that is the music industry... It's probably the book's only irony that one ends up feeling that maybe the industry dinosaurs have been mistreated..."
2,Pretty Things - 'Freeway Madness' (Original Masters) 2 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1972,'Freeway...' was the band's eighth lp. By this point,the Pretty Things have more or less seen better days. I always felt this album was a bit too mainstream/radio friendly for me. Think I liked the six(6)bonus tracks better than I did the actual album. Cuts I thought were 'okay' were the beautifully done ""Havana Bound"",""Over The Moon"",the semi-rocking ""Rip Off Train"" and ""Another Bowl?""(love that song title). You might see this title in certain dealer's catalogs or music site's description as 'their last good one'."
4,so darn cute!,"super cute and soft. good size and looks to be great quality, doesnt really rattlle to loudly tho."
1,Looks like the dog played with it.,Really disappointed in this toy. Fortunately got it on sale. Would have been miffed if I had paid the msrp.It's full and dirty looking and the rattle hard to hear.Hope the Cloud B gentle sound travel giraffe I bought is better. Won't know until Christmad.
3,should be used-good versus used-very good,Overall used book is in good shape. Pen notes on one page. Pencil underlining and notes on two other pages.
3,More of the same,Another in the same style as all of the Ramage series.Fun deversion. Little substance.
4,Nice rebound from previous books.,"After having been on vacation for 2 books, Pope finally decided to sit down and write something interesting.Ramage is sent to the South Atlantic to claim an island for Great Britain. As we comes into the harbor, he comes across several other craft, one of which turns out to be a privateer (well, the war is on hiatus, so they're really pirates). The others are 'prizes' with the passengers still aboard. This all makes for great suspense. Will Ramage get everyone free? Of course, and the fun is watching how. You'll have to read it to find out how.There is also some good character development. The secondary story, one that has been going on since the first book, concerns Ramage's love interest, the beautiful Marchesa. This book defines and decides their relationship.All in all, a good book and an easy read."
3,"good, not great, for power yoga","Was looking for a mat with some cushion but also a non-slip surface to use in power yoga. The surface of this mat is slightly ribbed, and it provides better traction than the more expensive Manduka Pro mat (which I also have), while sacrificing just a litte bit of the cushioning the Pro mat provides. However, if you're doing heated yoga and sweat a lot like I do, the ribbing isn't enough to keep you from sliding. I've gone back to my original Manduka mat plus a Yogitoes skidless towel for the hot yoga, but use this one if I go to a non-heated class."
3,"Eh, I want to love it....","I just can't. I've done everything suggested to make it not slippery but still my hands slip. My feet don't (which is interesting, huh?)) I'm really frustrated by this mat.The rubber smell has been most persistent too, I've left it out forever and it still lingers. At first it was the sort of smell that I couldn't get out of my hands and you could taste it - if that makes sense.I really wanted to love this mat because it's got the perfect feel it's firm yet cushy, wide enough and a really great color but dang, the slippery-ness is enough to make me a little crazy and distracts me so much during my practice that I have a hard time really getting into it.For the cost there has to be a better solution, I'm sure."
2,Stinky and stretchy,"My daughter gave me this lovely looking mat for Mother's Day. It is thick and comfortable, but after 10 months of using it two or three times a week I'm dissatisfied with its quality.It smells terrible, and I can't satisfactorily wash it. Sure, I sweat on it during yoga -- but that is to be expected, and I use the recommended cleaning product, which I purchased separately.Second, it seems to be stretching out in the places it bears the most weight. It doesn't lie completely flat any more, the edges curl, and it often trips me up. I am also constantly clipping strings from the edges.For less than one year of use, I am extremely disappointed."
4,Best mat ever!,"This is a great mat and it's ecologically friendly also. Can you beat that combination?! Yes, it took several days to air the mat out before I took it to class, but after that initial period, it's been all good. The bottom of the mat is very tacky and will pick up anything that's on your carpet. The longer length is appreciated, especially when we have to stagger ourselves on mats in a packed class. It is heavier than other mats, but I have no troubled rolling it up and transporting it. No more Gaiam mats for me!"
5,Best Mat I've Used,"I love this mat. It's longer, wider, with more cushion than most, and it has a great grip (I do flow and it seems to grip better the more I use it). There was a slight rubber smell for the first few days, but I didn't find it offensive, nor did anyone in my class - and they would have made me practice in the hall if they were bothered by it!As for the weight, I'm 5'4"" 125lbs and I have no issue with the weight - 6 lbs to me is not a big deal - with the reviews about the weight, I was a little surpised about how easy it is to transport and why all of the fuss.It's a great mat that is eco friendly and will last - making it less expensive overall because you are not replacing your mat every year."
5,great!,"I love this yoga mat. It works great even in hot yoga. The rubber smell takes a while to go away, and it is a bit heavy too, but I still love it. My favorite yoga mat to date!"
2,This is heavy as lead,"After seven years of practicing yoga I thought it was time to splurge on a great mat. I bought this one, let it air out for a couple of weeks (as they suggest), and hefted it to my yoga space at home. Carrying it already felt akin to lifting weights, but I thought it would be worth it. Not for me. The side you use is hard as a rock. The underside is padded, but, somehow, that does not translate into a cushy surface to practice on.If you like a hard surface under you by all means get this. It's certainly bigger than other mats which will give you more space if you're practicing in class. Frankly, that's the only recommendation I have for this product.Of course, I liked the idea that it was eco-friendly; so, now I'm researching ways to recycle my old mats. I'm thinking of cutting them into yoga block sized squares and gluing them together to use as props for supta baddha konasana."
3,"Great mat, but...","I didn't realize that having a biodegradable, natural rubber mat meant that it would biodegrade in my car. After a couple of suny days, the edges started to turn brown and feel weird."
2,Disappointing,"Upon receiving this yoga mat, we were excited by its being biodegradable and positive for the environment. However, the first use immediately led to a huge let down. This yoga mat became extremely slippery, and seems to hold sweat on the surface, making it even more slippery. Also, as others have said, the mat smells very odd.We were so disappointed that we swiftly returned this product."
2,Not Happy,"I washed this mat according to the instructions. I rinsed it many times & the soap wont come out. I have repeatedly soaked & rinsed it to get it out, but it wont work. Now the mat has a bad smell. YOu should nit wash this mat!"
2,Disappointing,"After reading the reviews on this mat regarding its slip-resistance, I decided to give it a try. According to the Manduka website, the EKO mat is the most slip-resistant mat they sell. After a few weeks of practice on this mat I'm ready to return it. It's like doing yoga on a slip n' slide. No slip resistance at all."
4,great mat,Its super-comfy and sticky. I can stay balanced in poses that I could not before. It isalso nice that it is longer than many mats. The only problem is that it attracts lint and dust easy (because of the stickiness).
3,Slippery,"I bought this mat several months ago. I practice hot vinyasa flow 2-3 times/week. I researched before buying this and thought this would be the best eco friendly mat. I have been disappointed. It does smell a bit, but that does not bother me. My hands slip like crazy in downward dog. I have tried yogitoes and regular towels with no luck. Even my feet slip some on this mat which is dangerous. I am currently researching to find another mat that won't be so slippery."
5,Great mat!,"I didn't think I would be able to tell the difference between my old $10 yoga mat and this $60 one... but I decided to give it a try. It's awesome! Cushiony enough to not hurt my back or wrist during yoga, but at the same time it's easy to balance on the mat (it's not too soft). The smell is not bad at all, in fact I think it smells pretty good. I got the sunset color, and it's beautiful. Also, it's very sticky, no problems with slippery hands."
3,Smelly nature,"While this is a good quality mat, the smell is really something to get used to. Sure, it's all natural, but the experience feels like rubbing yourself against a pair of truck tires. To be fair, it's a very sturdy (and heavy) mat. Slip resistance is decent and the cushioning is all right. Although I will keep this mat and use it until it withers away, I would suggest that if you're looking for something natural and environmentally clean -- try a grass lawn. There isn't anything natural about getting a rubber body massage."
5,Great mat even for a pregnant beginner,"Since I started taking prenatal yoga classes, I didn't really want to use the ones provided at the studio. Everyone's feet and sweat... yah, I'm a little germaphobic. I looked at different yoga mats and decided that I wanted an eco-friendly mat that wasn't slippery (don't really want to land on the little one I'm carrying).I bought the coral color mat and love it. It's thick enough for me. It is big but, I bought a green Indian Peacock Barefoot Yoga bag and carry it to and from class easily.It does have a strong rubbery scent which goes away after a few uses. Other than that, this mat is awesome."
1,Not quite what I expected,"This mat was very cumbersome and heavy, but most of all the rubber smell was very strong. I aired it out, washed it and did everything recommended, but even after three weeks, the smell was too strong for me. In addition, when I used the mat, the smell remained on my hands for hours. I ended up returning this mat and purchasing something else."
3,Slippery when wet,I've been using this mat 1-4 times a week for a year and a half and I have mixed feelings. I feel good about buying an eco-friendly mat but this one has its disadvantages. The bulk is cumbersome which gets annoying in my Iyengar classes when I fold it up twice for Sirsasana or put it on the seat pan of a folded chair for supported backbends. Also I work up a sweat in my practice even without being in a hot room and this thing gets slippery immediately. I had to buy a number of Yogitoes towels for any sort of warm or vinyasa classes or sessions heavy on standing poses. Even an extended Adho Mukha Svanasana is annoyingly difficult without a towel for my sweaty hands. The mat shows sweat stains easily but I clean it with water and a bit of apple cider vinegar which is no problem. I'm in the market for another mat to bring to class but I'll probably keep this for my home practice.
2,"nice, but slippery surface","I bought this mat from amazon with high hopes. First of all, the positive: great width, length, thickness. Now the negative: this mat has a oily slippery (and very smelly) surface. I've tried other rubber mats, and this one is the slickest. I couldn't sustain a downward dog without having to use a cloth between my hands and the mat. Manduka suggests using 50% vinegar solution, but I am very disappointed it's so slippery."
5,Excellent,"the manduka eKO yoga mat 5mm is excellent. very durable, comfortable, and big enough for all poses. If you are transitioning from a smaller mat - different material then you will find this mat a little on the heavy side, but its worth it. the eco friendly material makes it outstanding in all respects."
4,pretty decent...,"Best mat I have found so far, but it is not without its share of downfalls, it takes about 6 months of daily use to break in, until that point its VERY slippery. It is also heavy, and the rubber smell never really goes away, I'm still trying to break in the pro-lite, and thus far this one is my favorite..."
1,Terrible smell,This mat has a nice texture and thickness but the smell of rubber is soooo bad that I cannot stand to be near it! I aired it outside for several days and it is still sickeningly rubbery smelling.
2,Mat is cold in New England,"I've been practicing yoga for over 20 years. This mat is made from natural materials. I learned rubber is dense, it stores cold well. In winter my body has to warm it up first, and that is unpleasant. I cannot use this mat in winter. With yoga you need to feel warm, not chilly. I even put it on a carpet, not a bare wood floor and that does not help in winter. I think you could use it nicely if you have radiant floors for heating, but I don't. I use a cheap $4 yoga mat during winter time. Very expensive for this rubber mat, and it fed on my environmental ethics since we are destroying the planet (and our human health) with myriad petroleum synthetics. Too cold to enjoy in winter, even with a cloth facing that is melded with the rubber. Would not recommend where there are cold winters, I am sorry to say. A positive: In warm weather, it is awesome! Love the feel of it when it is warm."
1,Slipping on this mat is worse than on my $9.99 mat,"I wish I didn't waste my money on this mat. I am a small 5'2"" 112lb girl and I slip around like no tomorrow. I've also been practicing yoga for nine years. Today, when coming down out of a backbend, my hands slipped out and I landed on my head. This is the last straw. I really don't get what all they hype is about. All this mat needs to do is not move around, not let ME move around, and provide some cushioning. It's not that tough and for the $65 or whatever I paid for this, I'd figured the mat would deliver. What's more, when I unwrapped my mat for the first time, I noticed long 1"" fibers coming off the edges of the mat. Are you telling me this company can't even afford sharp blades to cut the mats? They're using dull blades? I mean, c'mon. I'm done with Manduka and for now going to back to my ghetto mat. It performs much better than Manduka."
1,Slippery and expensive,"After being advised to spend the money on a good quality natural rubber mat, I purchased this. If you are practicing any kind of hot yoga, or are a person who sweats more than others, this is NOT the mat for you. It is hopelessly slippery, even with a yogitoes, as the texture is smooth and does not grip the towel at all. This mat ruined a few classes for me, and I am still looking for a good quality mat that is sticky enough for me to sweat through my class and maintain contact with my mat. I'm currently using the rental mats at my studio. It's a bummer that I wasted so much money on a mat that is useless to my hot practice."
3,manduka eco yoga mat,I have been using this mat for about a month and although it's the best mat for stability I can hardly stand the smell. I'm thinking the smell of rubber may not be eco friendly and I wouldn't recommend it.
1,Disappointed!!!!,I was so excited about receiving this mat... I ordered this mat in February 2011 and by November 2011 I am ordering a new mat. I read a lot of great reviews on this mat but I guess mine was a lemon. I contacted Manduka a few months back when I started experiencing the sliding and they were not helpful at all. They simply recommended turning it over or buying a spray they sell. I tried flipping it over but after a few weeks that doesn't seem to work anymore. I do not recommend this mat if you practice hot forms of yoga. Manduka will only ripe me off once!
2,I cannot get past the odd smell,I was so excited to get this mat. The instructions said to unroll it to help dissipate the smell. That did not work for me. I also tried a mat freshener to no avail. I also find that my hands and feet slip on this mat making down dog unstable. I switched back to my $10 Mat from Walmart.
4,Maduka Eco-Friendly Yoga mat,"Pros: dense, sturdy rubber mat that stays flat and secure to the floor.Cons: strong rubber smell that lasted a couple of weeks; put it in washing machine hoping it would eliminate smell, learned that this kind of material absorbs water and takes days to drip dry."
2,My search continues for the perfect mat....,"I do yoga just about everyday. I really wanted to love this mat, but I am very disappointed. I am sliding all over the place on this thing!! It is heavy, but since I'm only tugging it from my car to the studio, its okay. The smell is tolerable. After slipping so much, I tried to go back to my Gaiam mat and found I do like the grip so much better, but my Gaiam mat is so thin and uncomfortable on my feet. I really like the thickness of this Manduka, I just wish the surface was less slick."
5,Fills in the blanks!,"This book was well written, and if I didn't already know better, I would have thought it written by the GrandMaster Himself! It answered quite a few questions that I'd lingering about ever since I began reading the Foundation series about 25 years ago. Of course, true to Asimov's nature, it does leave a few dangling items for future connections to be made so perhaps we can expect more in the future.Once I picked up this book, I couldn't put it down..."
4,Asimov Junkies Need Not Despair,"I just finished reading the second Foundation trilogy and have found it to be nearly addictive. I believe Brin did the best job of any of the authors in reintroducing us to the Empire/Foundation universe. The only drawback to the series as a whole was continuing the old master's work of integrating the seperate universes of his Empire, Foundation, and Robot series, which was problematic at best. All in all though, Brin does an excellent job. Fans of Asimov will find themselves losing sleep and meals while enjoying this new series."
2,Not even close,The trio of Foundation sequel books not written by Asimov are terrible and don't even come close to the originals. I could not follow this book and found myself just skimming pages.
2,I am glad I finished reading this series!,"Book One of this series was lousy. Book Two was decent. Book Three was the final one in the series, which is probably the best thing that can be said about it. I feel that the writers' goal in getting involved with this project, other than making money, was to attract Asimov fans to read their other works. In my case, at least, they have failed. If there is anything that can break a deeply-ingrained habit of finishing a series once it is started, this series is it. There are some decent moments in this book, but it is confusing and filled with pointless activity that ultimately accomplishes very little. I gave it 2 stars only because it does tie everything together and because of the timeline in the appendix. I checked this book out from the Library. I absolutely cannot recommend that anyone pay hardcover prices for this one."
2,expected better,"To sum up quickly this book I would say I am very disappointed with it. After the riveting foundation's fear and foundation and chaos, i expected this sequel to be excellent. Instead, I was in disbelief through most of the story at how unAsimov some of the things being written about were. The parts the characters palyed didn't seem to fit well into the established Asimovian universe. And I found it hard to believe that the robots, with the future of Gaia ahead of hummanity, would do what they do in the book (without giving away any spoilers). Also, I felt Dors Vanabili part in the book was way off character. The ending was a let down to me. It left me with the same feeling I had when I watched I claudis- that I've invested a weeks worth of reading, only to be disappointed. I don't normally flame any writers work on Amazon.com, but i feel this book was such a letdown, I want to let others know of the potential for disappointment."
1,Bizarro,"This book is the most boring and bizarre of the 3. If I hadn't read the other 2 I would've just stop reading this one. Several times I just wanted to hurl it across the room never to be picked up again. I should've because nothing happens requiring anyone to read it.Brin just repeatedly re-hashes everything I already knew from Asimov's books, and then turned eveything around so that Daneel and Hari (and, to a lesser extent, Wanda), once the good guys, are now megalomaniacs. If that's not enough to turn anyone off, how about this: Dors falls in lust with another robot. And these are just a couple of examples of the nonsense in this book. I've never read Brin before, and I certainly never will again.This book couldn't be further from Asimov's Foundation in every way except for the use of Foundation in the title."
3,"Decent, photos a little outdated but ideas are not","This book was a little shallow on information for me. It dealt more with different types of fencing than anything else, which was helpful but not terribly creative. Some of the ideas, while very good, are rather cost-prohibitive for most people, such as constructing a sunken patio with stone walls (as seen on cover)."
2,Gardening Book,Very dated book--the shipper sent this book a full week after the rest of my order arrived. They had misstated the condition of the book _VERY USED. A disappointment.
5,Nice Gadget,"It's a good product for playing MP3'sVery simple design, but good sound quality.Remote control is good, allows me to focus on driving, instead of fiddling around on the dashboard.The good thing, is that it remembers the last track played, I listen to MP3 books a lot, when I restart the car, it remembers the last track played (also last radio Frequency used)Good stuff, great value"
4,Cute.,"I used to have a few Cabbage Patch Dolls when I was a little girl and we used to have this cute Christmas special on tape but it got messed up. Despite the fact that it was very commercial I remember liking this and thinking it was really sweet and cute, I wouldn't mind having it on tape for my collection of holiday videos."
1,2 UNITS SAME PROBLEM,"The featurtes and picture quality are first rate, however both units I recieceved had the same anoying problem of freesing for 10-20 seconds at each scene change. I hear that there is a firmware fix but I do not choose to deal with this. This item should be recalled and no longer sold on the Amazon site."
1,"Yummy tapes, but hard to use.","It ate two of our video tapes. It did a horrible job of autosetting the channels and the time (our old super-cheap VCR did fine on both.) And it was hard to use, requiring you to switch between vcr and dvd functions in odd ways (like, when there was a DVD in, I had trouble changing channels on the TV)."
2,Not really rack mount,"Despite the title, rack mount hardware is not included or available. You can lay it flat on a shelf and it's 2U high: sort of a poor-man's rackmount."
1,Not 11 x17,"Product is 10.5"" x 10.5"" print. So unless you want 3"" of border on each side of print. Look elsewhere."
5,NYX IS THE BEST,love love love this product NYX LIP GLOSS glide on smooth and last all day just add some primer and set with a translucent powder if u have oily skin and go. Love it thanks
5,I have read this book!,"Without fanfare, this book has been more than helpful. From spendthrift to affluence ...it lets me call the shots. Insightful reviews guide my trip of a lifetime ...and I need help. The logistical insights of important connection to the ancient while nurturing tourism avoidance within all possible bounds has been accomplished."
2,Cheesy,"I was very dissapointed in this DVD. I don't think it is wise of the star to show her belly and wear sequence in a CHRISTIAN yoga DVD. Worse is that she comes off as being sort of fake, ditzy and un-yoga-like.? I think her intentions are good, but her behavior is way too Hollywood. Also the sequence is not a very nice flow and they give far too much scripture."
3,good but not great,"I've owned the sylvania DVR90DE for about 10 months. It was incredibly easy to set up and use. I have never had a problem recording TV programs and it works great for making DVD copies of my VHS tapes. I do find that the picture quality gets pretty suspect if I record at more than 6 hours per disc. I mostly use DVD-RW media and I prefer to record at 4 hours.I would give this recorder 4-5 stars except for the fact that it doesn't work on DVD-Rs rated above 4X and DVD-RWs above 2X. That means it won't record or even play a DVD that is rated above 4X, even if its recorded at 4X. I would not have bought this unit if I had known this in advance. Having said that, it hasn't been too big of a problem yet as i am able to get 1-4X DVD-Rs. However, these DVDs are getting harder to find; I have to order online as I can't buy them in stores anymore. Also, if I was to try to play a DVD-R that someone else recorded, it most likely won't work as most people are using the higher speed DVD-Rs."
1,NOT COMPARABLE!,"If you are purchasing this player to copy old home videos to DVD-R for family and friends, keep looking. DVD-R media recoded on this Sylvania can only be played back on this player/recorder. Other recorders such as Sony's produce DVD-R recordings that can be played virtually on any other DVD player. Nothing in the user manual states this, it took me over an hour of hold time and 4 tech's to finally get this answer."
3,Sad discovery,"Unfortunately this product will not record many shows played on cable or satellite, probably because of some security or privacy protection technology. I had a Bruce Lee special that was recorded in my Tivo but when I sat through the 2 hour program, the disc just showed a blank page. Or maybe I am doing something wrong. I am not totally computer illiterate and the instructions seemed easy enough to understand but I must return it since it appears to be of no value to me."
1,First and Replacement Steamer Broke within a month,I actually loved this steamer. It worked great...for about a month. Then something went wrong were it just shut off after a couple of minutes even though there was much more time left. It continued to do this every time I tried to use it.Three cheers for Amazon. They were great. They immediately sent out a replacement. The replacement then worked for a little over a month and the exact same thing happened again. Amazon told me that they won't replace it again because the problem is too widespread. Rival must have some defect in this product.
1,Piece of Junk,"This device shuts off before the steaming is done. I bought a unit that lasted a few months, bought another one and it died even faster. For a simple device, it's hard to fathom it could work this badly. Don't waste your time and money... I hope there is a better steamer out there somewhere."
2,NO MANUAL,i think i may enjoy my steamer once i find a user manual for it. i purchased this steamer from amazon and did not receive a user manual.
5,Humanizing Opera,"If anyone has a doubt about Bocelli's operatic ability, I urge him/her to get ""The Opera Album"". It is powerful. Some of you critics may want to get your equipment checked."
3,Lifting,"I once went to niagra falls with a companion who attempted to describe my feelings of awe by explaining the chemical processes going on in my brain. Maybe that satisfied them but it did little for me.Andre is more than a label or a piece of vocal engineering, he is a man (and quite a man if you know his story). He seems to one of those who can touch the ear of the soul and lift one from the reality of now into another dimension of being where one is just glad to be alive to experience it and perhaps touch something of the here-after. The rest I will leave to the engineers."
4,"A bit over my head, but very good non the less.","The person who reviewed it for Amazon.com is an idiot. Bocelli is the greatest tenor alive, even, shall I say is greater than Pavaratti. The choices of songs for this album is ones that are non very well known, but you cannot deny the greatness of Bocelli's voice"
1,Bocelli... an operatic tenor?,"Readers, please do not let me discourage you from buying the Romanza album of Bocelli's )as it is spectacular); however, I will tell you that the other three albums (Aria, Viaggio Italiano, and Sogno/Sueno) are not great. I am listener who has extremely critical ears, because I myself am an operatic tenor (17 years of age and in the Atlanta Opera). My criticisms of Aria (& Viaggio) are in that Bocelli is NOT an operatic tenor-- he is one that uses pure sotto voce and/or falsetto in the high range -- he is a true baritone with ""fake"" high notes. For this reason, when on stage, Bocelli uses microphones (A BIG NO! NO! IN OPERA). He is a WONDERFUL pop singer however!!!!"
2,???????,"You people make me sick. How can you say that Bocelli is greatest opera singer EVER. I fell sorry for him that his blind, but did someone who gave this CD 4 and 5 stars listen to other tenors. Ever listen to the golden voices of Nicolai Gedda - hear his recordings of Faust and Turandot, Franco Corelli - listen his Tosca and Trovatore, Di Stefano - his recordings of Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci, Mario Del Monaco - listen to his Carmen, Carlo Del Monte - his recording of Traviata, Ion Buzea - hear his Rigoletto, the list is endless. All of this opera singers are better than Bocelli. He isn't in the Top 100. Don't get me wrong I don't have anything personal with him. His voice is not bad. But like someone said in an interview of Bocelli's performance of Puccini's Boheme in 1998 in Cagliari: Bocelli isn't good enough for opera. Everybody understood my point. Now I wait for the contradictory and offensive e-mails."
1,Bad very bad,I received this album as a birthday souvenir. It is insurmountable to be heard. Now it is part of my past. Thank goodness .
1,He is NOT an OPERA Singer!!,My review will be short and brief: The man is NOT an opera singer. This album is truly disappointing. I guess he is but a part of the growing trend in popera.
5,Bocelli sings from the soul to others&#65533; souls.,"It is easy to critique or criticize a much loved and lauded performer, even one of Andrea's caliber by someone who lacks the ability to sing. It is easy to find fault when one has developed the habit. Look for the best and you'll surprise yourself! You might need to be patient with yourself to get a broader perspective. -- A friend of Bocelli"
3,"Yeah, right, Andrea. Like these are pop songs, right?","Sorry, but Andrea Bocelli gives a far better performance on this CD than practically any other opera CD I ever heard. The reason I gave this 3 stars, however, is that it would be comparable to his more successful ""pop"" records. I'm like, now I know why he's more popular on the U.S. charts than Sarah Brightman is. He has a BEAUTIFUL voice! The only reason I bought this album was that I liked Andrea a whole lot. Love that handsome pose, though..."
2,Compare before you buy.,"A funny thing just happened to me. I happened to hear ""Addio, fiorito asil"", from this CD, played on the radio. I enjoyed it. Then, a few minutes later, I heard Pavorotti singing the same aria.I was blown away.Try it. Compare Bocelli with Pavorotti, or Carraras or Domingo or even Lanza, for that matter. Compare specific arias, side by side, and you will see why ""classical"" critics don't warm up to this fellow.It is not that he is ""bad"". It is that there are many others who are, quite simply, great. So, why settle for not bad?"
4,The most beautiful tenor voice on earth,"Andrea definitely has the most beautiful tenor voice on earth. I am not saying that he is the greatest tenor, but he certainly brings passion into all his music.If your looking for some good pop music than buy ""Sogno"",but if your looking for opera please by all means buy ""Aria"".I have been an opera lover all my life,and Andrea's voice has made me love it even more.I am studying voice myself and happen to know that his high notes are not ""constricted"" or inconsistent.I would like sarah to listen to pour mon amore again and tell me if those high ""C"" sharps are constricted. The album is a must and I recomend it to all opera""dummies"" as well as to all opera lovers."
1,Hard to see why anyone thinks he is an opera singer.,"Let's see, you have listened to: Schipa, Caruso, Gigli, Tagliavini, Corelli, Bjorling, Distefano, DelMonaco, Bergonzi, ..., Pavarotti, Carreras, Domingo. Very hard to see how Bocelli fits in this group; you can even hear him breathe before hitting high notes, and he is not as lyrical as Pavarotti or as sweet as Distefano. No doubt he will remain popular with the general public, but that's only a measure of selling lots of records."
2,"nice voice, but no opera singer!","This is the biggest hype. I can't even believe my ears. All these people saying that Bocelli is the greatest tenor of all time? Go to his romance cd and you'll see over 90 reviews. Could it be one person who is in love with Bocelli who just keep coming back and putting in top reviews? Well, I will speak the truth here, he is good, but not even very good. He need a microphone. For a true operatic tenor, there's the young Pavorotti!"
2,Sarah Bryan Miller was kinder than I would have been...,"Okay, it's better than Charlotte Church or Sarah Brightman, he does have some nice moments. But conservatories are pumping out undergraduates every day who could do the same thing. I think his choice of rep on this CD is really boring, and why would an amateur tenor take on such well-known works? It just doesn't make sense. The sooner this ""opera lite"" craze ends, the better."
1,Amateurish train wreck,"Those others who rated this one star were all too kind. This is a train wreck. Those who rated this more than one star must summarily be taken out, offered a last cigarette, allowed last words and then shot. This voice is incredibly unsuitable and unsuited for opera or even for ANY professional engagement. It is weak, thin, uneven, unsupported and totally unexpressive or emotionally involved. It is a sad commentary on our society and the state of the classical record industry when this pap is foisted by producers (who clearly know he is woefully unqualified) to sell CDs to totally unsophisticated and uncritical fans. If you have any artistic sensibilities whatsoever don't listen lest you have nightmares, need months of therapy, and find your ears rebelling in pain."
4,Good CD,"This is an outstanding album. However, listeners may also want to try ""Amore: Italian Love Songs"" by Luciano Pavarotti. I'm not going to get into a silly ""who's better"" debate--everyone is entitled to their opinion. Is it possible to enjoy Bocelli and Pavarotti BOTH? I certainly think so! Shoot, I even enjoy Domingo, Carreras, and the ""Irish Tenors""."
3,Aaron Elkins tries again,"What is it that drives Elkins to write suspense stories about Americans getting caught up in European intrigue? He's demonstrated a fine ability to write technical murder mysteries (Gideon Oliver, Chris Norgren, the golf mysteries with his wife Charlotte), but he seems to want to write spy novels instead. And unfortunately, he's not quite as good at them.The first Gideon Oliver book was a spy novel set in Europe. So was the first book in the Chris Norgren series. And so was Loot. Now we have this one.It was OK, but not great. I was able to set it down halfway and only finish reading it a week later. I can't do that with Helen MacInnes novels that I have already read ten times!The story is pretty typical of spy novels -- an innocent man gets caught up in intrigue, his wife disappears, he searches for her, etc. The most interesting twist is the things he learns about his wife during the process. But it's not interesting enough.Please Aaron, write another mystery...."
2,Disappointed for the first time...,"I've read everything by this author and enjoyed every book....except this one. Perhaps it was because I have developed such expectations based on his past works. There were too many segments where things just dragged on and situations that just repeated themselves. Lily and Pete were too shallow and neurotic for my tastes, although somewhat improving by the book's end. The ending was a nice twist but not enough to push the overall rating of this book higher. I've certainly missed Charlotte's works lately and hope she will have something new coming out soon."
5,Surprisingly good!,My 9 1/2 year old son is thrilled with this costume! It is decent quality for a costume and the price was reasonable. We are very happy.
4,Beware of the size,"Great costume replica, but there're some flaws with the size, the belt is so big no child could used it, just the same with gloves."
4,A must have for your Star War Fan!!!,"My son chose this Costume for Halloween. The material isn't any better then in a Costume that you would buy at one of your local stores. It is a very thin material and has velcro straps for closing in the back. The helmet is very cheap and thin plastic. It was way too big for my sons head so he was wearing a knit hat underneath it. The gloves are very small. We also had to buy the guns with it, it didn't come with the Costume....But he is still playing dress up every now and then, so I guess I got my money worth!!!"
2,At least my son is happy,"We just purchased this for Halloween. I'm glad I get to air it out for a few weeks because it smells stongly of vinyl/plastic. My son loves it of course and it's got a lot going on as far as detail. But what the picture doesn't show you, is that the gray armor plates are like a hard foam rubber. They're not flexible like in the photo and on our costume they are dull dark gray, not silverish. The belt is even worse, frankly it's a kind of gross brown rubber. Even though I was pretty sure we ordered the ""deluxe"" version with the full helmet, it's still just a half mask. For the money this is disappointing. We're keeping it because my son is excited, but probably the ugliest costume we've ever had."
3,Costume way to big.,This costume is too big. The size chart is way off. The helmet is impossible to keep in place. Im going to have to add padding and Velcro to see if I can't get it to stay still on my kids head.
5,Great quality and hours of fun to come,"We really wanted the 2 piece helmet instead of the mask so we ordered this costume. It definitely runs large. My almost 5 year old is average and it's a bit big on him. We are going to have to rig the belt to fit right, but it's still a great costume. The molded rubber pieces are great and all the details make it fun. My son even likes pretending to shoot the blasters and other weapons on the arms. He'll be able to play in it for a long time and I'm sure when his younger brother is big enough he will be wearing it too! It shipped the day after I ordered it and arrived just when it said it would."
4,"Good Costume, Flimsy helmet","My son loved this costume...he is a huge star wars fan! It is 3D and really looks good on, but the belt is way too big for it to fit any kid. I tried to add some extra Velcro, but the costume is a slick rubber like material, so even the heavy duty stick on Velcro did not work. Also the helmet is way to big and very flimsy compared to the costume. Overall my son has gotten many hours of good play from this costume though."
4,Fast Delivery!,The costume arrived quickly and it was good quality. The only problem was the costume runs small. I Would have gotten a bigger size if I had time.
4,Theory and Practice of Histotechnology,"An excellent book for someone who is starting to learn about histology. It includes basic information that is helpful and may be used as a guideline for personal lab work. In addition, one of the chapters includes the commonly used medical terminology and lab mathematics, so if you're new in business, this is an extremely helpful chapter."
3,"BORG,OH BORG!","It seems as though the farther away that Art Asylum gets from its ENTERPRISE line, the dicier their offerings get. ENTERPRISE merchandise is excellent, NEMESIS merchandise is good, and BORG merchandise-so far-is just o.k. The problem with it is that it looks too cartoonish. The proportions are no where near realistically human, and the color and detailing more resembles TODD MACFARLANES' horror lines than anything to be found in the STAR TREK universe. Come on ART ASYLUM! Stay the narrow course-don't give into mediocrity as do so many manufacturers of SCI-FI products!"
2,Much smaller than expected,This item states that it is for children 14 & up. My 10 year old looks to big for it & she is very small for her age.Nice set for the money but should state for ages 5-8.
1,Disappointed,"Yeah, it's pretty. Great in theory, but it actually hurt my arm. It doesn't sit comfortably, and the sharp ends actually dug into my skin, leaving angry welts all over my forearm. Sending it back. Sorry, I really did want to support the artist in Thailand, and Novica is an awesome company. Just didn't work out like I thought it was going to."
1,Thunerhead-Son of Flicka,I never did receive the DVD. I've been ordering products from Amazon for over 6 years and this is the first time I've not received what I ordered.
3,About average,"My Kodak V550 suddenly died and after reading the reviews for DSC-W80 I decided to purchase Sony. The picture quality is very good, but it is slow (I tried to take some pictures of my baby and by the time the camera snap the photos, my baby could be gone). My main complain is the video. Unless I use the highest quality setting (about 100Mg per minute) the video has bad resolution."
5,Best gift ever,"Before this I had a Kodak and a Canon. Both very good cameras. At the time of my first, the Kodak, Sony was very behind (i.e. cameras used floppy disks), so you can imagine my surprise with my new Cybershot. I like very much the software, espescially the slide show feature with music: even better when connected to the tv set. You also can edit images (crop red eye) you've taken directly on the camera. Plus, it comes with a very smart connection cable: it's usb AND video/audio, so you don't have to carry so many cables around."
1,Fuzzy Picture,"If you plan on taking pictures of small children or baby, THIS IS NOT THE CAMERA! As some of the other posting mentioned. Motion produces Fuzzy or Ghost-like image. Low light produce grainy pictures. I know some would say that the way it works but I don't recall my old 2.0MP sony camera was this bad. The only optimal setting I find is a very bright sunny day inside or outside and your subject is not moving around then you have great pictures. I also find that sometimes you think you took a great picture as seen in the LCD but when you actually see it on your computer, its a total different story."
3,Sony and the bad Lens Motor strikes again,Bought this for my sister-in-law. Nice Point and shoot with nice editing features built in.Had lens motor problem after a short time. Sometimes lens won't come out...other times it's stuck in the out position.
3,"Good camera, but mine was faulty","I bought this for my father-in-law. He loved it, but the camera froze up after about 5 months.It had to be returned. It was still under the one year warranty. The replacement works fine.If you like a larger display screen, this is not it. Check out the T-100 or newer T-200."
2,my 4 year old 2 mp nikon 1500 was better,"I bought this camera as a point and shoot to carry in my pocket for pictures . After lenghty reading online, I had pretty much assumed it was given at this price point. I am constantly getting ""motion"" warnings and my pictures are often blurry. Where are all those ""spectacular"" pictures everybody is talking about? What's the good of a point and shoot that you can't simply pull out of your pocket and take a picture? There were smaller, slimmer and cheaper cameras I could have purchased at the time. I would NOT buy this camera again.My regular pictures are sometimes blurry but always grainy but pictures taken in self timed mode are always blurry.I was comparing the pictures to my old nikon 1500 and i swere that camera was much better and much stronger than this delicate waste.I feel so bad that i gave off my old camera to someone.that one was so nice.anyway i returned this back to circuit city and got canon sd1000.hope this one works better."
3,A Good point 'n Shoot under Bright Light,"This Digicam is good under bright lights, but when shot in indoor, the image looks dull & grainy.Sony Cybershot DSCW80 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and Super Steady Shot (Pink)"
1,Worst camera experience EVER!,"I ordered this camera last month, and it worked fine for a week or two. ALl of a sudden the camera is refusing to be turned on and is displaying "" turn camera off and on again"" on the screen! this is a total rip off. I contacted amazon, and they aaid it will take TWO months to get a replacement!Talk about terrible service!"
1,"Very Bad pictures, image stabilization, low light prob, bad videos","Hi,I bought Sony DSC-W80 on Jan 14th and opened the box on Jan 19th.Used the camera at Children's Discovery museum and tried every possiblesetting possible on Jan 20th. The WORST picture Quality, Worst ImageStabilization, Worst Videos (Grains seen in every video). OH! One morething. If you ever want to take Videos using sony cameras, you cannotzoom once you start recording. The lousiest setting that you can everyrun into. I walked back to the store and the customer rep tried every otherSony model and said that all of them have the same problem. Cannot zoomwhile recording in video mode. I am just thinking if I should purchaseCanon 870 IS. If some one tried this camera in low light settings, withkids moving around, taking some videos etc., would appreciate your thoughts on Canon 870is."
1,Sony is not a good camera maker,"I have owned 7 cameras so far although the first four were film cameras that were no longer used. I bought this Sony Cybershot DSC W80 a year and half ago after reading all the good reviews. To my disappointment, it suddenly stopped working a month ago. For unknown reasons, after it was turned on, it would not allow any bottons to function. I checked for repair - will cost over $100 by Sony! I could not believe a camera should stop working in such a short time!!! All my other 6 cameras are working fine, the oldest is a Nikon I bought in 1981. I will never buy a Sony camera again. Sony afterall is not known for cameras!"
4,Good Buy,"Great little camera for the price. This camera does not have all of the bells and whistles as some of the more expensive camera's, but for the price you get a great camera with more features than the average user will ever use, and so far, it seems that this camera is as reliable and rugged as you would expect from the sony name."
5,I love this camera,"I've been wanting a simple very small camera that I can point and shoot. This camera you can literally point and shoot and it takes perfect pictures every time. I haven't run into anything about this camera that I don't like. Our family went camping and there were beautiful sunsets, I think this camera was keeping up with my husbands Canon EOS Rebel XT, OK he could take some more intricate shots, but this one took some really great pictures. I would definitely recommend this camera."
4,This is a really nice camera!!,"I bought this camera for my girlfriend and she love it, it's easy to use and takes very nice pictures (I mean we're not professionals), it has a nice zoom (maybe not enough) and a well set of functions."
1,Worst Camera on the Market,"This camera works great, until it is out of warrantee and then watch out. I and hundreds of others have had the same problem with this camera. The lense will start going in and out numerous times when you power on the camera and then it never works again. Sony will repair it for you for $91.00, right. Sony should be sued over this camera,not make more profit. It is a defect in the camera. Don't buy it unless you want to throw your money away."
1,Disappointing Sony Customer Dis-Service,"I've owned this camera less than 2 years. I've taken hundreds of pictures. It takes wonderful pictures - travel, close-up, family, everything. Then one day the lens wouldn't open and it gave me the error message: ""Turn the power off and on again"". Didn't help. I called Sony and they had me re-initialize, to no avail. They gave me an estimate of $97+ for them to repair. I checked around the internet and this seems to be a common problem. Too bad Sony won't stand behind their products. There are too many other choices out there."
2,Good reviews - but okay camera,"before i bought this camera, i came on and read the reviews. everyone left comments on how great this camera was, so i decided to purchase it. guess they forgot to mention how crappy the zoom on this camera is. size wise wasnt too bad, but wish it was thinner."
3,Better than nothing,"After buying this product I saw there are some new models that are muche better (touch screen panel, etc) that all buyers have to consider in a buying process"
1,Never received,Product was not received because of sellers delivery mode without warning that the delivery required a signature. Also FEDEX promised to keep item until I could pick up at their facility and instead returned it to the sender. By that time is was too late to find this product elsewhere.Won't buy from COMP USA.
3,Not as good as I hoped,"This camera in my opinion takes medicore pics at best. The controls are very easy to use and the wheel next to the screen makes changing your pic controls a snap. I have found that all the pics; still, motion up close and far away still have a very distinct blur that I would not expect from a 7.2 mp camera. It takes the same quality as my Sony cyber-shot 3.2 mp. They should drop the price at least $100.00."
5,One of the best SONY Cybershot Camera DSC-W80,This camera is awesome it! It can zoom in on far distance scenery or get that close-up. You can even record video with this camera. It takes perfect pictures all the time. You can even add to the pcture with a list of different backgrounds and scenery. You can even set it to automatically snap a photo of yourself or a group photo with the 10 second timer.A must have item for 2011 Christmas and in the year 2012.
1,Have decided to give up on my DSC80,"I am not sure about all the ""positive"" reviews on this camera. Maybe it is the particular one I have got, but I do see some very negative reviews. I grew up in a photo studio and know enough about cameras. Only ~1 out of 3 pictures I took with this camera turned out reasonably good. Majority of the pictures were blurry and grainy, sometimes even in well-lighted settings. Overall quality of the pictures are not nearly as good as my ancient Canon G2 (3 or 4 MP? I bought it 8 years ago, unfortunately battery died 2 years ago). What a waste of many cozy moments! I have decided to trash this piece of junk and get a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5, which I hope will work better. Don't think I can return my Sony to Office Depot since I bought it 9 months ago."
4,Sony cybershot,"I had an old old old sony cybershot maybe one of the first? I don't know but I loved it so I wanted a new one. This is amazing. The macro on this thing beautifully captured butterflies at the butterfly farm in St. Martin! I am so happy. So far I'm glad I purchased it. It comes with a rechargeable battery which is great - the first sony cybershot i had ate through batteries causing me to buy expensive lithium ion AA and instead of eating through batteries it ate through my wallet. It has a beautiful sleek shape and design the large LCD screen is great for reviewing photos! So far, I love it!"
5,Sony Cybershot DSCw80,I think it should come with a memory stick so it can be used right out the box. Or made clear that it will not work unless you purchase one.
3,"Nice in looks, average on performance","The camera offers the latest in design and weight, but I had hoped more from it, especially since I was upgrading myself from by ""archaic"" Cybershot P72 (3.2 mp), which by the way, is still serving me well. I had hoped for sharper pictures, especially in low lights w/out using flash (on manual modes), but was frankly, disappointed. The image stabilization works well in outdoors, but not indoors, definitely not w/out flash. The menu is more complex, one of the things I had always held Sony in high regards for.I also had a Canon SD 800 to compare with, and Sony really loses it there. I have been a loyal Sony customer from my childhood, but am sad to see my loyalties shifting."
2,Terrible Pictures in Low Light,"Movie mode is great. The camera takes great outdoor pictures in bright light. But it is impossible to take a good picture indoor, no matter which setting I use. Even automatic setting doesn't work. All the pictures come out red and blurry. I can only use this camera for outdoor pictures and for video filming. I'm a little disappointed."
1,"Poor image quality in medium to low light, hard to avoid blur","We bought this camera as smaller alternative to our Digital Rebel SLR which is roughly 7MP as well. We wanted something smaller to take on quick trips, snapshots of the kids, etc... We were very dissapointed with the image quality, especially indoors where less light is available. Most of the images came our red and grainy, many were blurry. I have experience with photography and tried multiple settings, but the image quality still suffered. We are going to try to return this camera and get a point and shoot Canon and maybe spend a little bit more. The convienence and form factor are not worth it if the image quality is terrible. We should have stuck with Canon in the first place. :-("
1,Do not buy this Camera,"I got this camera last year to replace my Canon SD10 which i loved and i still love becasue it works better than this new DSC-W80. It takes blurry pictures, shutter is too slow and its just a piece of junk. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone! and trust me there is no operator error, i owned many cameras and i know how to take a picture."
3,Great acting,This movie is about a gambling cop who tries to pay off his debts by stealing from a pimp. The movie is dark and gritty. Ray Liotta does not disappoint.
3,Skip this one,I saw an interview with Anthony Lapaglia recently and even he didn't want to talk about this movie. Thats saying a lot. There are too many characters to care about in this movie and none of them are fleshed out. The hollywood fascination with corrupt cops has been done one too many times and this movie is a waste of a lot of fine talent.
2,Dreadful collection of cliches,"A boring, predictable film with every plot and visual cliche in the book. I simply got tired of the pointless, meandering plotline. Halfway through the film, I realized that virtually every single scene change began with someone lighting a cigarette, and it then became humorous and ridiculous to watch the cliched cigarette lighting routine every 30 seconds.A yawnfest, I only watched the whole thing because there was nothing else on TV."
1,This bookstore is horrible,"This bookstore made sure that the book arrived at the latest possible date. I tryed to contact the owner the only way possible, e-mail, 3 times and never got any responses with regaurds to my order. I will NEVER order from this place again nor would I ever recommend them. I sincerely request no one else takes the chance, unless you don't mind waiting 3 weeks for an in-country order, ordering from this store. I was EXTREMELY displeased with the lack of professionalism."
2,Just like any other food coloring,"I just needed this for an experiment (I needed a lot!) But then I didn't need it anymore since I found a bigger one that was cheaper. Too bad, when I found out about the cheap one, my warranty was expired. ONE DAY EXPIRED. These guys couldn't give me my money back one day after? Really? Wouldn't recommend to buy from these guys."
4,Fun Read,I read this book shortly before moving to Japan for 7 months. I think it did a great job in explaining lots of intricacies I came about while teaching English conversation. Fun time and a wonderful country.
1,Worst transaction ever through Amazon,"I ordered this book, knowing it was used. What I received was definitely not in 'good' condition. The book is completely disgusting, completely falling apart, stained, and smells bad. Had I known it would be in that bad of shape, I wouldn't have even paid 25 cents at a garage sale for it. Unbelievable."
4,"Really good, not perfect","Since the ""how it works"" has been covered in other reviews, I just want to mention that if you have studied with Michel Thomas in another language, (we learned French with his tapes) then you might have a harder time transitioning into Spanish because you'll associate the sound of his voice with the first language you learned, and maybe I'm biased, but I thought the French tapes were easier than the Spanish, and his accent worked better with the French.Otherwise, it's a quality product, better than other Spanish tapes I've tried because of the way it's taught, but I do wish they'd edit them without the students."
1,dick - whatta guy!,remeber those mushrooms clouds in EyeRak and how he got five draft deferments so he wouldn't have to go to Vietnam - a war that he supported. And how about his war profittering from halliburton - those choice dick moments are not here!
4,This should have been better,"I saw a TV documentary in which Gergiev and Toradze were working together, and they seemed to have a special affinity, not to mention that both are Prokofiev specialists. With that in mind, I expected this set to be ablaze with inspiration. In reality it is simply good, and in some regards falls considerably short of excellent. The piano sound is not full compared to what Ashkenazy gets on Decca, and the overall thrust of the music can't match Richter, Argerich, and various others in the individual pieces. All in all, I consider this set a keeper but hardly definitive."
5,A Christmas Classic,"The topic of Ziggy's Gift came up in a casual conversation - as in ""Do you remember that Ziggy Christmas show from way back?"" I did, and later went to Amazon hoping to find it, and there it was. Ordered it as a Christmas surprise and was delighted to see this great program again. It's only a half hour show,and it is touching and 'sweet' - as my twenty-something gift recipient noted. Not the Nutcracker or The Messiah, but something you might want to add to your list of Christmas musts."
3,OK.,I'm not really a fan of the the Ziggy comics but I did enjoy this cartoon it was kind of a strange Christmas cartoon and not exactly an essential that I just have to have in my collection but if I saw it on TV I would probably watch it again though it doesn't seem to be shown on TV anymore.
5,Ziggy's Gift,I think it is a wonderful and meaningful show and I highly trcamend it to all my friends.
3,painting animals that touch the heart,"Beautiful pictures, I really enjoyed reading about the emotional content for painting the pictures and how she picked the photos to use.Was hoping for more guidance on the technical aspects of using pastels on velour."
5,"Entertaining, Beautifully illustrated, Wonderful word-play!","My son and I saw this book when it was first released in Hardback edition, but we were unable to afford it...Finally it's in Paperback! This book is such a wonder to read, my son age 6, in fact demands that ""he"" read it to me..We spend alot of time discussing the playful word use. Its fastly becoming a favorite bedtime book in our house."
4,Usefull book to get ideas of stone landscaping,"I'm glad I bought this book.In the first part there are lot of pictures about stone use in the garden (stairs, patios, walls, paths...). For someone who needs the ideas or insight of stone landscaping possibilities I would recommend it. Of course the number of examples is limited with the number of pages, but it is in accordance with the price.In the second part are how to instructions which are also OK. This kind of instructions can be found also in other books, so for me the reason for buying this book would be the first part."
5,One of the BEST time travel series ever!,"I can't tell you how happy I am to see these books being re-released! If you are a stickler for scientific accuaracy, you won't have room to complain. If you love history, you'll find that these books are acrually based on real world events. Just enough variety is added to make history fit into the story line. And to add a little exta spice..... When your favorite main charactor seems to be in a no-win situation, you CAN NOT assume that he will be saved at the last moment. Simon Hawke is not all all afraid to kill them off."
2,Flawed publication of Classic S/F Story,The classic TIMEWARS series is back in print after many years. The first two books of this series will delight readers who like to think and read about time travel and its many paradoxes. Hawke came up with a wonderful way of making history fun as he said in the new intro while dealing with many of the classic problems of timetravelBe forewarned tho. The copies I recieved had over a hundred typographical errors which seriously impede reading the story. I have written to the Publisher (Pulpless.com) and hope they will make needed corrections before book 3 comes out and hopefully rerelease books 1 and 2
5,~LIFE CHANGING~,"Simply put, there are many self-help books that make a lot of sense to readers, they then go on and attempt the things in the book, some may see results, while others may not. This book is different. If you use the techniques that this wonderful writer has put together, you WILL see results. It's a self-help book, mixed in with Sprituallity, and I can't say this about too many books, but this book was truly LIFE CHANGING, from the Positive affirmations, to the creative visualization, the reader who truly feels and understands the importance of this will be enlightened..I was."
4,"Finally ""Universal Laws"" in print ;)","I have read some great books like Embraced by the Light by Betty Eadie and You Can Heal Your Life by Louise L Hay, and they both say that there are Universal Laws which we must adhere to or reap the consequences, and the more we know them the better life gets, BUT they don't tell us what they are! It was so frustrating! Linda wrote out 31 of these Universal Laws and they seem pretty reasonable, she doesn't say her source but I assume it would be the Universe and Life from her psychic powers. At least it seems like something to build on! She speaks about life, religion and psychic things in a very practical way, ie ""God rewards hard workers..."", and in a way that gives hope for the future. Practical advice, insightful. Thank you Linda ;)"
5,to really live a story,"there are many great SF books, brilliant, interesting and all you can wish for in a story. but i've never felt when reading a story like i felt during reading this book, you actually live through it, and as a result live through the thousands of years. you can have this experience only by this one way... read the book."
3,if u have got time to kill....,"if u r a veteran sci-fi reader, it will just kill ur precious time and conclude in managing to fulfill a certain place in ur bibliolife. If u r a newcomer, u shall find a lot."
3,Short version of Heinlein's Time Enough for Love,"This book provided nothing new. Throughout the book, I wondered if I was reading a comic book version of Heinlein's Time Enough for Love, or maybe an extended script for a Highlander the Series episode. Although not a bad read if you have 3-4 hours to kill, it is neither spectacular nor groundbreaking. If there is a sequel I would like to read it, as this seemed rushed and unfinished."
2,Not for Highlander Fans,"The premise of this book is interesting; for some unknown reason a few immortals are born here and there around the planet. This is not so much a novel as a disjointed collection of vignettes and short stories that cover the centuries since ancient Phoenicia to a bizarre future where everyone is immortal. If you are expecting the derring-do and character development of the television series Highlander, skip this book. It drags unmercifully in parts, and is overall unsatisfying and (dare I say it?) boring."
4,One of Anderson's better efforts,"Interesting and unusual story of a few immortals living through human history, from the distant past to the far future. Good character development and social commentary, along with a suitable amount of action and drama combine for a satisfying result. Highly recommended."
2,I'm just not seeing it.,"After reading all the great reviews for TBOAMY I just don't see it. I've been reading Sci-Fi for over 25 years and this is one of the most boring, repetitive novels I've ever read. Basically the novel is written in a series of short stories following the lives of a handful of immortals. The problem is that the themes are very limited. You've got your ""two immortals meet"" theme, your ""immortal tells his/her story to a carefully selected non-immortal"" theme, and your ""immortal escapes from a group trying to kill him/her"" theme. These three themes are present in the opening chapters and repeated for over 500 pages. I only finished it because I never leave a book unfinished."
2,"It could be better, much better.","The plot is quite interesting but only for the first 100 pages or so, then it becomes somewhat repetitive and the final part shows a twist that doesn't fit with the rest of the book."
3,Disappointing,"An excellent idea poorly developed. What might be the behaviour of a 3,000 yo human being? Would he/she still behave like all of us? I doubt it. I also doubt anyone could survive for so long since the immortals can be killed as easily as ordinary human beings. Let alone any mad guy who would enjoy doing away with them.The short stories are rather unequal in quality and the whole plot somewhat misfired."
4,"Nice guide, well-organized","Living in California, I don't get a chance to hike in New Hampshire as often as I would like. But when I do, I always take this lightweight guide along in my car and in the pack. The best part about the guide is that hikes are described in detail and directions to each trailhead are given in exhaustive detail. This is especially important for out-of-towners who aren't familiar with the back country roads. The authors have hiked each of the trails and they offer pithy comments on trail conditions, the possibility of seeing wildlife and other pertinent information.There is a separate section on the magnificent Cohos Trail, the 200+ mile hike which runs the length of the state. My one slight criticism is the photos, which could be of better quality, but the text, route descriptions and ancillary material are of high quality."
4,Cute but smaller than expected,Cute car and fun for the kids to experience the possibilities of solar energy.The car was smaller than expected.It's just a little larger than a stick of gum.Needs a very smooth surface to ride on and needs mid-day direct sun to work.
2,DON'T GET IT (READ),"Yea. Don't get this. the description says, 2010. but its actually two dvd's made in 2005. which look like they were filmed in 1998. don't waste it. i thought it was live concerts. and cool stuff. this is boring s***."
5,not what i expected!,"so, i bought this CD thinking i was getting the 'brian eno' version... but no; it was the 'bang on a can' version! hmmm, 'bang on can' doesn't exactly conjure up ""ambient"" music.well, i gave it try and man am i impressed! i'm not sure how this stacks up to the original, but this is awesome mood music!highly recommended! ranks right up there with eno's ""apollo"" disk."
3,be patient with Brian...he gets better,"Although his best work is done when the techniques he mastered in this type of album are intertwined and layered subtly into his more pop-like albums, those cannot be fully appreciated without a bit of time spent with this and other ambient albums like Music for Films.RonJon"
4,nice,"First off, if you are unfamiliar with the original ""Music for Airports,""...shame on you!! :) get it and listen to it mnay times before you dive into this one.The concept of this cd left me cold at first; I was very skeptical- how could anyone, no less a string group, be able to recreate the mood and feel of this album?! After all, its as sparse as an album could get in feel...But, to my admitted surprise and delight, this group did just that, and how! A very faithful reproduction of this lp, and in ways I didn't think possible, this recording has its own life and gives Eno's work a whole new look.While it is not the original, nor does it get played nearly as much as the original,this cd is a triumph, and made a believer out of me."
3,Apollo Is Enough,"The ambient genre seems seems an endless exercise in psuedo etherealism, to coin a phrase, that extends from musical exercise to musical excerise and from disk to disk, simply employing diverse, layered instrumentation. Is seems perpetually repetitious without a lot of contrast. Much as P Glass repeats from measure to measure in much of his work. I like Bang On A Can, but the material ............... I also own ""Brian Eno: Apollo"" (a soundtrack) which, if you want/need ambience is probably the only disk of the ambient type that you'll require. At least there is inspiration behind the creativity instead of being simply another ambient exercise."
4,Excellent Mountain Bike,"Great value in a good looking, nice riding entry level mountain bike. After years of non use, I pitched my old bike and bought this bike--what a value at under 140. Good looking, easy to assemble, smooth ride, great brakes and an excellent shifter. Mountain riding? I live in South Florida, can't rate that, but for an excellent riding bike, I don't think you can beat this one for the price."
2,Some issues you might want to consider......,"The bike itself looks great but I had a few issues with it after a couple of minutes riding. First, the handlebars (assembled by myself as per directions) are not in a comfortable position for me to ride in. Second, when the bike came the threads for both pedals were stripped. I needed to to re-bore (?)new holes and get bigger pedals so that the rebore threads could be used. Third, make sure that you grease some of the bike parts before riding or you will be having metal on metal grinding that will shorten the lifespan of the bike considerably. Overall it isn't a bad bargin for under 140 bucks, but my advise is to have it checked out by a bicycle shop before riding it long distances for your safety. One last note, there is nothing like having your rear brakes (assembled by the company) not be able to slow the bike down because a couple of screws were not tight enough when assembled."
1,Just first google it,"A few keystrokes and a decent selection of keywords will provide as much information as was provided in this book. Book is being generous it is actually more like a pamphlet. Not at all what was expected, instead of an overview of techniques and or perhaps exercises and instruction it is a list of sources to check out. If a list of pointers to sources or a directory of where to look is what is being sought then this is an ideal item. If information and instruction or insight are being sought - not so much. Instead of being able to gleen information on how to do a better cold reading or techniques that could be used to build or improve cold reading skills or transfer cold reading skills to other presentation formats - it was just a list of sources for information. Perhaps those sources provide more value or substance - though that seems unlikely. All fluff no substance. Save time and money and just google using a good keyword list."
2,model solar car,The wheels on this car are so small that you need a completely smooth surface for it to move successfully. It had a difficult time navigating the pavement bus loop at my school because the wheels are so small. Larger wheels would make a big difference in improving this product.
3,Get the DVD,"This is a 5 star opera and performance, but the DVD is $20 cheaper and much better. The sets and costumes are gorgeous; no skimpy, kooky mod-squad quirks. The music has much more lovely melody than we sometimes get from the earlier Prokofiev. The comic plot from Sheridan is complex, but more lucid and logical than is sometimes the case in this genre. The multiple deceptions which lead to the comic conclusion unfold with delicious irony. This is a rare gem of an opera; a comedy which bears comparison with Mozart's MARRIAGE OF FIGARO, Berlioz' BEATRICE AND BENEDICT, and Verdi's FALSTAFF."
5,Life Changing,"Knowing that the God of the Universe has a purpose and plan for my life is certainly awe inspiring. I am so glad that I am not on my own. I have something real to contribute and I have value because I have a vision that is centered in Christ. This book just let's me know that God truly loves me and is interested in every thing I do and wants me to become everything he has purposed for me to become. I have to always to remember to embrace change.Thank you Pastor Rick, you have always put things into perspective for me."
1,distorted view...,"Rick Thomas has a distorted view on what Biblical principles really are. He wants you to order his ""pamphlet"" when you can get the same information from any late night infomercial. These ideas are merely regurgitated thoughts spewed from the mouths of the likes of Jim Baker, Robert Tilton, Jimmy Swaggert and so on."
1,waste of money,"There is nothing inside, just two pages this is a scam. Don't buy it. waste of money, total file is just 5 kb. I'm not even able to contact Amazon to tell about this."
5,Off Da Chain!!,"If you wanted to know anything about this phenomenal human being then pick up this book! It is totally awesome! There are so many original items in it. It's a must-have for his true fans and those just getting turned on to 'Pac. There's his lawsuit against the OPD, pictures after getting beat, the handwritten contract signed while he was in jail on sexual assault... just a whole slew of personal artifacts from the man himself. It's a treasure and a timepiece that those who really loved him, must own."
3,What is true?,"What is the truth? Will anyone ever know? But i do know one thing. People have been sayin that TuPac is still alive. I don't believe it! But from what people have been saying I am starting t obelieve it. For example, they have said that in his funeral the cascet wasn't open. So they don't believe he was in it. And this is important: THIS IS THE 7TH YEAH THAT TUPAC HAS BEEN DEAD! And the law says that if u fake ur death for 7 years and then show up, u won't get arrested/in trouble. And how is it, that this is the 7th year and this movie came out this year. How would this come out after he is dead. So part of me believes that he is still alive. And when the book says that he was cremated, how do we know that, that is true. So the other part of me doesn't believe anything that is being said. That's it! I'M OUT!"
1,Arrived in terrible condition,"The watch arrived on time a few days before Christmas, and it was in terrible condition. Smudges/scratches on every single link, scuffed face with no plastic sheet sticker to protect it in transit - it looked as though it had been worn for a year. Don't know if this is Altivo's issue or Amazon's, but I asked for a return authorization the day I received it. This watch was a Christmas gift for my girlfriend, and I was embarrassed to even show it to her. Very disappointed."
5,Classic!!,"Revolt in 2100 is part of Heinlein's epic Future History series. It is composed of three short stories: ""If This Goes On-"", ""Coventry"", and ""Misfit"". From a young soldier and a revolt against a religious dictatorship, to a citizen convicted of a crime and faced with psychological rehabilitation or exile, to a young man who has just entered the Civilian Conservation Corps-- this is classic science fiction by one of the best! Highly recommended, must-read for science fiction enthusiasts."
2,No worth the price!,"The product was only 1 oz, I could have gotten it cheaper in the store! McCormick has 16 ozs. for less."
4,90%,A wonderful and rich journey. Excellent characterization . I can't wait to read the next book because it must have been started before he ended Drawings in the Dark.
3,OK... Worth a Read... But Powers Has Much Better to Offer,"The above says it all. The characters were quite intriguing, and you do get a good sense of the historical picture. The story was good, but not first-rate. Way too much graphic violence (for my taste), and a lot of it just didn't seem necessary except that it held to the story line and history of that time period. I am a huge Tim Powers fan and so far this is my least favorite. Read ""The Anubis Gates"" and ""The Stress of Her Regard"" instead."
5,Excellent,"An excellent read, one of my favourite books. Nice to see it back in print. It's entertaining."
5,Beer...It's not just for breakfast anymore,"It's so good to see this book back in print. When I first got hold of it, I was amaxed as to how good it was. Over the years I've had cause to re-read it a number of times and each time I find something new.Powers skillfully leads his readers on a grand adventure, while at the same time keeping everything light and fun and easy to read. By the time you've breezed through to the end, you realixe he's slipped in a whole boatload of allegorical messages about dealing with parents, following your dreams and not always seeing what you believe.And then there's the beer. Only someone of Powers' ability can make drinking beer an integral part of the Aurthurian mythos.I'll raise a toast to that!"
5,Quite An Amazing Album,"I first heard the title song while listening to Soma FM's ""Illstreet"" station. It just stuck in my head and I had to buy the album. Although the music is from an Italian film, many of the songs have a Bossa Nova bent to them. I can't find the film anywhere, so it seems like the music outlived the movie it was made for. The main track is my favorite, but all of the songs are great. I definitely recommend this to fans of jazz, lounge, and/or bossa nova."
2,Sounds Good but BAD,"I've heard lots of good about this toy! It sounds great! I've wanted one for ages, but I wasn't sure if it was really worth it. I'm ofcourse I'm a kid, but I can't really rely on a kid to tell me how good this toy will be. Ive seen one review from a parent who said it broke in like 2 hours! Do you really want a toy that undependable? Also I heard that the batteries are very, very expensive! Seriously!Is this toy that will brake so easily, and when the batteries are low, cost so much, worth almost 20 dollars? I don't think so. You go buy that piece of junk and waist all of that money for two hours of fun! But I'm not gonna go waist my money that was worked hard for, for such a lousy piece of junk! When you buy that thing, you'll be back on this computer writing a review just like mine, about yours or your child's breaking so easily!"
3,Hmmm...,"I don't have this toy...and based on what this toy does, I don't think I ever will! This is very expensive but the money is not worth it. Batteries are like $20-$35! Do NOT waste your money because this toy WITHOUT the batteries is costy. PARENTS, WATCH YOUR WALLETS!"
3,Silly PDA!,"One day my family had a tornement to see who was the best at foose ball. I won but I got 2 prizes. One was the rinkiedadink PDA. I set up every thing on it. But I forgot my password so I had to entiarly restet it. (By the way, the password can only be4 charectors long) The games are first entertaining but get boring. The shooting one is to hard, and the other two make nosence at all.There is realy no program that holds homework, and the date is confusing! This toy is better for people who are fasinated by anything. It's still cool!"
4,worlds best driver,"Nice DVD, good compliment to the book How to Kill the Ball by Mike Austin. Need to buy both to understand"
1,Disappointed,"I was very excited to get this dvd and begin learning the techniques of long ball hitting. Well, I received the dvd a few days ago and haven't been able to get it to work. I've tried it in my blue ray, 3 different dvd players and 3 different pc's. The dvd will not load into any of these devices. I'm going to have one of my geek friends check it out, otherwise I plan on returning it today for a replacement or refund."
2,Usual stupid comedy,"Like most modern comedies, this film aims to be senseless, absurd and go for the easy laugh. This film stars 2 obnoxious characters who are blind to the fact they are losers. The writer was probably going for ""Dumb & Dumber"", but there's very little likable about them. 99% of the comedy comes from the fact they are pathetic and disturbing. It gets old quick. Arnett and Forte compliment eachother because they can both be mildly funny. But this script, written by Forte, just sucks.I can only think of ONE funny, actually BRILLIANT, gag and you'll know what it is if you watch it. It happens very late in the movie. I'm disappointed that this was directed by Bob Odenkirk who is a very funny talent. Kudos to Kristen Wig as the competent straight woman to the two lame title characters.Worth a watch to see how lame comedians are these days and for a few surprising laughs."
1,Worst movie ever?!,"If you are looking for a doofus, funny, and light movie well this isn't it. Being silly and funny takes work and talent, creativity, looking at things from a different perspective; just throwing non-sense at a script is NOT funny. I can not believe people make money doing movies like this, they should go bankrupt."
3,It Ain't No Dumb and Dumber,"I was interested in this movie simply because my childhood idol, Lee Majors, is in it. Even his bionic strength could not juice up this mediocre comedy. Well, that was 30 plus years ago and he was in coma almost entire movie...I can see Forte and Arnett attempts to create fantasy/unrealistic plot comedy that well worked on movie such as Dumb and Dumber. The problem was they were not funny or gifted as Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels to pull this off.Don't get me wrong this was not a bad comedy. I actualy had a good time but if you expect this as another Superbad, this movis is not in a same league. This movie some what reminded me 80's low budget comedies that I enjoyed watching when I was a kid for double feature at the theater on Friday night or Staurday Afternoon. Therefore, it would be better off renting it at the video store."
2,Dumb & Dumber 3?,"They may as well have called this Dumb and Dumber 3, this time Lloyd and Harry, aka the Solomon Brothers are two brothers who are just completely stupid who have a father who slips into a coma and the doctor says something about there grandfather would've liked a grandson, so these two losers seek out to find someone to have a baby with and get stupider along the way.If they cut out the swearing, this would be a PG movie that even kid's would say was not funny. It has it's moments, a couple of small laughs, but the same stupidness over and over is irritating and annoying after a while.Cheap jokes, cheap laughs and a lot of failed humor. It could have been so much better with better jokes in it, but it falls flat. Even there attempt for a tearfully happy ending didn't work either.Rent it if your curious, trust me, you will wanna return it.P.S: if your cover says something like ""dumb and dumber meets Knocked Up"".... nah, those two movies where actually funny."
2,New speciies: geekus humanus?,"Raised at the north pole by their father, these two arejust not girl-wise? None of the girls they meet seems remotely humaneither. Having a baby by a sperm implanted mother for a lot of moneyseems an option when their father's last wish before he goes into a coma isfor grandchildren? Just so much of them not getting social conventionsor how to behave in public goes a long way?I really dislike this film and the people who wrote this bad script!"
1,"5 Stars, are you KIDDINg me?","I'm positive I saw the same movie as the other reviewers did, but come on! I decided to watch this this one because I really enjoy Will Arnet, but there is absolutely nothing going for this movie. To compare this to ""Dumb and Dumber"" is a total assault on stupid comedy, that movie had laughs, all this one's got going for it, is the dull, dry thudding sounds of one joke after the other falling flat.Please, do PASS on this one."
1,Waste of Time,3 words best describe this movie: Waste of Time.Its up there with all the worst of SNL want2be stars with no big screen appeal namely Will Forte.
4,Probably Not What You're Expecting....,"Give this movie a shot. It isn't over-the-top, you won't laugh until you fart and then spill popcorn in your lap. The humor is mostly subtle, dry, honest, but at times, edgy.At the core of this movie are two innocent, loveable and awkward brothers who would do anything to make their dying father happy. Not to mention, it doesn't hurt to have two of the funniest actors currently working in the industry as the main characters.So while it isn't entirely ""Dumb & Dumber"", it is almost as enjoyable."
5,Genius,"As you can tell from the reviews below, this is a love/hate film - you're going to love it or hate it. ""The Brothers Solomon"" is one of those comedies that makes the viewer uncomfortable, and where a lot of the comedy comes from the discomfort. The brothers aren't stupid, so much as hopelessly naive and socially inept to an extreme. The discomfort, and the comedy, arises from these fish out of water trying to pursue their quest in the real world. If you loved ""Titus,"" the UK version of ""The Office,"" or ""Arrested Development,"" you will likely enjoy this movie very much. If not, you should probably save your money and rent or buy something else."
1,The worst book i've ever read (by far),I became a fan of Malamud after reading The Assistant and was ready for another excellent travel but what I got was a awful account of man and ape and a storyline that came from a Roger Corman flick. The ending was so disappointing that I gave up on Malamud. The metal rods that he stuck in the ape's head is so corny that I was disgusted through the entire novel. Not his finest by far.
2,"Not terrible, but not as pictured","If you like Parker Jotters this is a fairly nice pen. The bottom is much darker than pictured, and the outline looks corroded at the edges. Rather than a nice light blue, the bottom is more of a cobalt blue, with navy/almost black outline. The texture of the bottom isn't consistent with the top.If this was $7 or $8 it would be worth it. List at $35 is outrageous. Even at more than half that, it's just not worth it. If you like the jotter, you'd be better off with a $5 standard silver or colored base. If you're looking for a flashier unique pen, you'll probably be disappointed by this.That being said, Its still a Jotter, has a nice balance, feels and writes nicely."
5,The best family history scrapbooking book,I love this book! It is is the best book of its kind that I've seen. It is filled with dozens of practical ideas on how to preserve family history with pictures and journaling. Almost all of the page layouts are ones that I will actually use. I love that it gives the websites where the specific papers and embellishments can be purchased. I wish I would have had this book when my childeren were young as it would have given me ideas to take the kind of pictures needed to make specifc layouts.
5,A serious approach to Japanese proverbs,"Most Japanese proverbs books contain more cute drawings than proverbs. This book is different. Not only does it contain more proverbs than the other books on the market, it also contains usage examples for some of them. This is a Japanese proverbs book that was written for serious students of the language, rather than readers who simply have some passing cultural curiosity in the kotowaza."
3,"lot of information, wish they included MP3","This book has around 3 or 4 idioms per page in japanese and english with explanations and examples. Overall good, but book would have benefited from some illustrations and an MP3 track to make it stand out."
3,Good book in some ways but also very odd,"This book is quite odd in that if flicks between what sounds like a dotcom consulting company pre-2000 and then to a univeristy academic and then back again quite regularly. I'm sure the academic content of the theory is flawless but it's like the author is pretending to work in in industry when in fact he's never seen outside a university. This is perhaps unfair as there's a limited amount of the ESP/CEP literature out there but don't be fooled into believing this book will be of practical use to you if you're a developer in industry being pressured into one ESP/CEP system or another, though it should cerainly be food for thought if you'd like to consider more deeply past some of the commerical implementations of ESP/CEP. If you're a software architect with no deliverables this is probably right up your street."
2,"OK... nothing special, no real insight","A decent book to add to the shelf and an informational read, but really nothing more.The book provides no real insight and as another reviewer points out reads more like an advertisement. It's useful to read to get an overall view, but much better books exist on the subject and it seems to be catered primarily to the non-technical. The book uses a lot of buzz words, wraps the topics in ""wouldn't it be nice"" scenarios, etc. but provides no real meat or content.All-in-all, decent to read, but provides no insight for business and/or technical decision making."
2,Rather disappointing,"I have been very keen to read this book and to learn about CEP and event-driven architectures. However, I found the book rather disappointing. The introduction to CEP for global enterprises is weird, after so many years after the dotcom-bubble burst. The examples in the first parts of the book (electronic media stores) are not convincing, because they do not really need CEP or EDA. Sloppy explanations and definitions are embarrassing; several definitions are self-referring (e.g., significance and event pattern) or inconsistent (e.g., event pattern on page 114 and 116)."
1,Surprisingly boring to read,"I tried to read this book. I have it on my book shelf and I can see it right now, but I really couldn't get past the introduction. For a supposedly technical book, the first chapter reads like a 1995 introduction to the 'information superhighway' and about how wonderful it will be. This sentence on page 9:""Another example is automated trading Web sites, or ""eMarketplaces"" as they are called.""Then followed by the word ""global eCommerce Web"". It just reads like a bad commercial from IBM or BEA telling you how to 'accelerate your eCommerce to web speed'.In theory the book should be good, but this kind of treatment really offends my technical sensibilities."
3,"Pretty solid, but I needed more practical exercises ...","... and his style is somewhat 'spare' for what I want to do with graphite and charcoal. I came into art from drafting/design and have been struggling with 'too much technique and not enough drawing'. While this book hasn't cured me yet it's a start (for life drawing) and appears so far to be better than most figure texts costing twice as much. Most life drawing books I've looked thru are presented more as anatomy studies or figure studies without what I call true instruction. This approach is probably great for more advanced hobbiests but for a beginner (and someone not very talented ... like me) practical exercises would seem to work better and Mr. Hamm doesn't really present alot of them, so I copy ALL the explanatory sketches for practice. If anyone has suggestions for a better instruction manual for life drawing I'd really liketo hear them. Until then, I'll work thru this one and keep looking."
4,it's okay...,"i guess if you've never had a class in anatomy drawing, then this book is for you. to be warned tho: nothing beats drawing from a real live model. plus, this book is VERY old-school...a lot of the drawing look like ancient cartoons...funny hairstyles that remind me of the mom from lassie...also, all of the drawings are in the same leave it to beaver's mom style...if you want a book that shows different styles and techniques...get ""the art of drawing the human body"", and if you want to draw cartoons that look like marvel superheros...with EXCELLENT descritions of how to draw muscles, get ""drawing cutting edge anatomy"""
4,love,I would purchase from this seller again and recommend. The item was delivered promptly and in the condition promised.
2,Not So Good,"This book seems a bit old-fashioned in it's exercises and drawing suggestions. Even the examples of women's faces look like heads of women from the 50's. Maybe it is from the 50's originally. Anyway, it is dated.The layout is messy and the faces cartoonish.I am hoping to find some helpful tips on drawing the human figure but I am not too optimistic so far.I'd say skip this book as I am sure there are much better ones out there.If you don't have it check outDrawing for Dummies, it is a MUCH BETTER instructional guide than this one."
5,MORE AWESOMENESS FROM JACK HAMM,"An light, undaunting, unpretentious and clearly-written/illustrated guide that illuminates about core truths in a way that somehow only Jack Hamm has done. If you don't already have Hamm's ""DRAWING LANDSCAPES & SEASCAPES"" then I very highly recommend that you add it to your life... Things I always sortuv intuitively knew about composition and spacial design are laid out in a fashion that is immediately comprehensible and useful. And these are thin, friendly books that have little bits of writing amidst tons of very very clear illustrations, so if reading chapters and large blocks of text makes you nervous, this will be a real treat. Jack Hamm wrote these with pure communication in mind -- no showboating or ego exists in these... they are pure gold, and he manages to only empower the interested artist. Plus, these are cheap. :)"
5,Satie elevated to his true height,Most performers approach Satie's pieces as if they are merely charming miniatures. By taking extremely slow tempi - we are literally talking half speed of what others do - Reinbert de Leeuw brings out the mystic qualities of the piano pieces. These performances are unlike anything you'll hear.
4,Eric Satie with Alzheimer's Disease.,"I'm sorry but my taste varies from the other reviews here. I actually like Satie's pieces as little classical miniatures. That is why they are so charming. I do not like waiting several seconds for the next note and not being able to recognize which piece I'm listening to because it is hanging in the air like a zen koan. While I agree that Leeuw's avant garde interpretation brings out mystical qualities, they are of the same sort as listening to water drops from a faucet. I can meditate on that but would I want to? I gave it 4 stars because what he does, he does very well in his own weird minimalist way. Would I buy the recording again if I had the choice? Not!"
2,Save your money,"Unlike other CRCpress titles, this one has little coverage of the subject. Neither transforms nor data compression issue has been comprehensively addressed. One can easily fand better chapters on transforms in many image processing and coding books, including the non-sinusoidal ones - which are missing in the book. Editors seem to contact with authors who apparently did not want to write tutorial-type texts, but who had some rather specific things to say (Eg. Comparametric transfomrs for transmitting eye tap video with PTP). That might be OK, however there are so many basic things which are not here. If transforms and compression is considered together, the book still fails to serve since many issues such as coding gain and other analytical analysis, as well as many popular methods have been superficial. As a whole, the book seem a bit inconsistent to me."
4,starry night review,i really like this poster i have it in a nice black frame above my bed it looks really nice. the only thing bad is its not as bright as it looks on the site but its still nice to look at.
1,nope,colors dont match original. wouldnt buy this again. not worth the money. could have been a lot better. :( disapointed.
5,a good night,The poster version to one of my all time favorite paintings. Very well done for being copied onto paper instead of canvas.
2,"Good quality, but not the whole picture!","My poster arrived quickly and looked great...until I noticed that the top 2 inches or so are cut off. About a third of the moon is missing. I expected that some of the painting would be cut off to fit the 2'x3' poster dimension, but I also expected that the trim would be reflected in the product picture. I am using this poster as the basis for an art project, and specifically searched Amazon for one that trimmed the bottom rather than the top of the painting, and was very disappointed when it arrived. If the picture on this product page reflected the actual product I would have no problem."
2,Dull,"I recently ordered prints of Vincent van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" and ""Starry Night over the Rhone,"" and was very disappointed. I love the pieces for their vibrant colors (especially the way the big, bright stars stand out against the brilliant shades of blue).Sadly, the posters I received were very dull and drab. The vivid colors were muted, and the stark white stars were light gray. I threw both posters away, rather even than give them to a friend. (What kind of a gift would that be?) It was a sad waste of money and paper -- and a poor representation of two of my favorite paintings.I see now that both posters' prices have been knocked down to hardly anything at all. They're still not worth it."
3,Great idea but frame needs more support,"I first saw this product in California when my cousin wheeled her baby in. It really appealed to me because it was lightweight and small enough to maneuver around in between crowds of people (and therefore small department store aisles). My cousin raved about how great the Snap N' Go was. I had to have it and immediately bought it as soon as I returned to Portland. This product has been well-used, however, if you're thinking it will last for more than one child--it doesn't. When my daughter was about 9 months old the stroller frame gave out where the handlebars were attached. If I want to use it I have to stand on the handlebars while the frame is folded so they can be bent back to the shape they are supposed to be at. A friend of mine has the Kolcraft model and it appears to be strudier. We definitely got our use out of the Snap N' Go however, I plan to buy Kolcraft for our next baby."
4,Good buy,"we used this system for our 5 month old since day one. It is extremely convenient and portable. I am pretty bummed that our daughter needs to go into a regular car seat now instead of her infant seat. we would buy and use this again. The only reason why I am giving it 4 instead of 5 beacuse the basket is a pain to use. The only way to get a normal sized diaper bag in and out is by removing the car seat from the base. the sides of the basket go up too high to get the bag out. This is not a problem in her current Peg Perego Venezia which uses a slanted basket. However, going out and about was made much easier with the Snap n Go. sad to give it up"
4,Great convenience,"I saw this stroller after my first child was born over 4 years ago. I made sure to get one for my second. I thought it was sturdy enough for what it was. It also made things much easier getting in and out running errands or picking up just a few things at the grocery store. Now that I she is in a convertible seat I miss being able to just grab the whole carrier and go. When I bought it, the Peg Perego system had just been recalled so honestly, I ""settled"" for this but I was very pleased. It maneuvers well and isn't as bulky as the other strollers with matching infant carriers. I only wish I had gotten their sit'n'stand version so my four year old could have had a seat when she wanted. She doesn't want to ride enough to merit a double stroller and is almost too big for most of them."
3,OK for the price,"The bike took about three hours of reading and tweaking (assembly, gear and brake adjustment) to get it road ready. I got a longer seat post (I'm 6'2"" and 235 lbs.) and new seat and re-painted (it looks cool all dull black). It ran great for about 200 miles when the crankcase and contents came completely disassembled, just fell apart. I ordered a good toolkit but it won't be here for up to two more weeks so I'm considering other options. I think the bike is an odd mixture of good quality and non-so-good quality parts and iffy pre-assembly. The dual suspension is great, particularly with my new bike seat."
4,"Excellent timekeeper, great crystal, with one flaw ---","I bought this watch 5 years ago, and it has run within a second or two per month of perfect time every since. The crystal resists scratches extremely well. The case and band look like new also when cleaned with soap and water. The clear window back is neat. The only problem is that these watches were until recently sold with a capacitor for power storage instead of a battery, and the capacitors fail after a few years and have to be replaced at a cost not far short of $100. The repair consists primarily of installing a rechargeable battery instead of the capacitor, and this should last longer -- I hope -- since I just paid for the repair. I think Seiko goofed, but the watch is great except for that problem, and the price relative to other high-quality watches is much lower, so it still is worth buying."
3,Turkey mold,I was shocked at how large they were for butter molds ( my fault for not reading closely). It would have been nice to have had instructions since I've never done this.
3,Gives an objective account of one Glomar Challenger voyage.,"For those interested in science, earth sciences or plate tectonics, ""The Mediterranean Was a Desert"" delivers. The book gives an objective account of one of the most important Glomar Challenger voyages. It gives a nice build-up to the discovery, made over the course of that summer voyage, that the Mediterranean had once virtually dried up. The author is a scientist and focuses on aspects of the science and underplays human relationships although some conflicts and human interactions are mentioned. I most enjoyed the descriptions of the way the Mediterranean Sea had been some 4 or 5 million years earlier, the progression of changes, and the evidence which brought him to this viewpoint and why. I least enjoyed the book's style which sounded a bit too much like it had been written by an average scientist rather than a Carl Sagan scientist. Still, it is a worthy read."
2,Lacking Gatecrasher Quailty,"I've been into trance for many years now and am familiar with true pieces of art and sad money wasting albums. Unfortuantly this album is a sad money wasting album. Scott Bond is an excellent Dj and I've heard much better than this from him. This CD mainly contains a few good tracks that I like to listen to occaisionlly but for the most part this CD contains no solid feeling trance and you'll get tired of listening to it after several tracks. Gatecrasher puts out an excellent series so if you are looking for something good try Gatecrasher Red, Wet, or Black. These are the true pieces of art and are worth every penny spent. All in all, stay away from this album and disappointment will stay away from you."
3,My first review ever!,"""Animal"" on CD2 is a totally amazing song. It has a strong, fast beat and would be awesome to hear in a club. Until then, I have to blast it in my car.The rest of the album is, ""ok."" It's not bad, but..."
1,Pointless filler!!!!,"I am like many a new trance listeners who go to their local Tower or Virgin and look at the sea of random dance comps. in the techno section and wonder, whats good? With retailers not giving the option of listening to or returning CD's, Amazon is a good place to find what you like. Unless you have DSL and can download everything, your like me and need to rely on those real player clips and these reviews, and so, for you, heres my helpful view of this album. Don't buy this CD! Every track you wait and wait for a melody to spawn or build to a climax. Trust me, it never happens. (...) Don't let this review turn you off of Gatecrasher however. (...) The second CD of Gatecrasher limited is good. It's the one with the green griffon. Hope this helped all you trance listeners out there. Stay safe, and drive safe!!"
5,beyond imagination,"This CD bring me a lot of images. Moonlight shadow,morning fog,rainy night,so quiet world,and so on..Sound of piano and accoustic guitar make me feel so luxuary andlittle sentimental.After listening to this CD,I naturally shed tears.I don't why,but that was really sweet experience.This is exactly a universal music!!"
3,"Not the best MST3K, but an appallingly bad movie","The Creeping Terror is truly a bad movie. The MST3K dialogue is occasionally funny, especially when the boys point out that in the absence of the discovery of drugs, the '60's would have continued as depicted in the dance scene. My favorite scenes: the vague ... depictions of the giant carpeted bugworm eating women. Garter belts and all."
5,Shudda ate the director!,"I never really noticed that Mike and the Bots were a little weak on this movie until I readthe other reviews below. To me it doesn't really matter. The Creeping Terror is such alame attempt at movie making that it doesn't leave much for the gang to point out. Inmy personal opinion Creeping Terror is the worst movie, from a craft standpoint, thatwas ever released.Other movies have stupid looking monsters, feckless acting and poorscripts but Creeping combines all three and adds a NARATION that puts at the pinnacleof poorly made movies. This movie is a new type of bad. Actors mouth their lines andthe narrator describes what they are saying. It is like the movie was made in someforeign language that can only be paraphrased. At times the movie is narrated,sometimes it is a talky and near the end it is a silent slapstick. If you are looking for thebest of Mike and the bots this ain't it.If you are looking for near total ineptitude inmovie making you came to the right place.Leonard"
2,Even MST3K can't save the day.,"Far be it for me to knock MST3K, but even they can't make this garbage watchable. Honestly, there's just nothing there to work with. As already described, the film for whatever reason, eschews actual dialogue in favor of toneless narration, and the pace of the movie matches the monster: it creeps at you. Now, the boys on the Satelite of Love can do ok with plot wholes, bad acting, bad directing, etc., but they're at their best when they rip on the cruddy dialogue found in the films they watch. Without that, most of the jokes seem forced, or just aren't as clever as they should be. I can't even think of one really great line from Mike (or Joel) and the robots as I can in other episodes. The numerous flaws make ""The Creeping Terror"" unbearable to watch on its own. But those same flaws make it an unmockable film, even by the experts. Skip this one, and get ""Eegah!"" or ""Pod People"" instead."
5,Jeepers Creepers!,"Put aside for a moment the fact that this movie has more padding than Twiggy's bra, as all of the action literally creeps along. What really sets this film apart is the fact that it's got one of the goofiest looking monsters of all time. It looks and moves like a crazy float from a parade in the bizarro world. The monster's victims must be suicidal, because most of them literally crawl into the creature's mouth. At least, I think it's his mouth! Most of the time we only see the legs of some girls going inside it as they're being devoured. Tom Servo notes, ""I think this is kind of a weird little turn-on for the director."" There's a scene where the monster goes to lover's lane and eats the kids making out in the cars. That gives a whole new meaning to term ""meals on wheels."" The creepy monster creeping along, combined with the hilarious MST3K comments, makes for an unbeatable combination. This is one Mystery Science Theater 3000 movie that should be released on DVD."
1,Broken after first use,This item broke the first time we used it. It was floppy and completely unusable. We will be returning it.
3,"Not the best, but it works","I bought this hoping it would save some room in the camper, but it doesn't seem to be made very well. So far it has worked over the one weekend that I used it, but it constantly comes loose where the telescoping handle locks. I guess you get what you pay for, but I will continue to use it until it either breaks or I get so frustrated that I break it myself."
3,Convienient but..,Stores well. Bristles clean well enough. Does not stay locked in place reliably. After being extended it frequently unlocks & swivels while sweeping.
2,Good but limited,"The image is bright and clear at a distance. However, I could not get them to focus on anything closer than 50 feet."
5,Bushnell Permafocus 10x42 Roof Prism Binocular,I gave this to my son for Christmas. He lives in the country where there is much wildlife. He thoroughly enjoys the the feature that keeps it focused.
4,A glimspe into the past,"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It is a look back at a simpler America back in 1870. One where the frontier of the west was still to be won and farming was the best chance to make a future.The author tells quaint stories of the toils of everyday farm life with a humorous touch. Their family moved to Illinois when that was the end of the known world to Americans. He talks about his youth at the farm with his brothers and parents. He described the work, school, friends in the neighborhood, and religion. This is a must read to look back at America.FG"
4,This is not light reading...it is seriously funny.,"The Clan of the Flapdragon is a fun book of short essays. Each one concerns the history of some word or phrase, but quickly veers off in unexpected directions. The word is ""weenie"" in ""Weenie Roasts and Ecotage"" but before long Dr. chrapnel has managed to slur environmentalists, the Buffalo Bills, Sarasota county commissioners and Oscar Meyer. This is not light reading, a book to be kept on the nightstand to induce drowsiness. Read Dr. Schrapnel carefully and you will be awed by his insight, revolted by his pomposity and floored by his wit...sometimes all in one sentence. Often, as in the excellent piece ""Hoodunit"" you may wonder whether Schrapnel has done some outstanding research or just made the whole thing up. Unlike Dave Barry, he never tells. But in the end it doesn't matter...""Hoodunit"" is fun to read in either case. This book is best enjoyed like a box of chocolates: one or two a day. Okay, maybe a third, but save some for tomorrow."
4,Classic Timepiece,Real value for your money. Well i dont want to praise it too much for fear so many people would compete with me when i wear it. It's awesome and classy yet sporty. You can play golf with it or go to that job interview in that pinstripe suit wearing this MEN'S Seiko Watch. I cant complain. The looks from admiring females when i rock it. Sweeeeeet!!! :))
5,One of Goblin's best albums.,"This second album by Goblin, following DEEP RED and preceeding SUSPIRIA(their first album as Cherry Five doesn't really count), is one of their best works. Though it is not a soundtrack, tracks from this album have turned up in such films as PATRICK and WAMPYR(the European version of Romero's MARTIN). Two tracks, DR. FRANKENSTEIN and AQUAMAN, have even been included in some releases of the SUSPIRIA soundtrack. This is a great album. Any fan of Goblin has to have this CD. It is very much in the '70's progressive rock vein and is perhaps not as dark and sinister as the vast majority of their other albums. The superb talents of Simonetti-Pignatelli-Morante-Morangolo are in evidence here, the songs allowing each member ample opportunity to shine. The songs are strange but, unlike most prog rock, are not torturous and drawn-out affairs. Repeat listening only enhances the enjoyment. This is truly a great CD that belong in the collection of any follower of Goblin."
2,Boring rubbish from Floyd wanna-be's,"I love italian progressive rock and have a little bit of italian in my blood. Having said that, I have all the major players and many minor players in this genre. Goblin has always been spoken of highly and I don't quite understand why. I much prefer their offshoots (ie, ""Cherry Five"", ""Flea"", etc..) to Goblin themselves. Roller (IHMO) is a very dull instrumental album which tries to sound too much like the instrumental passages on Floyd's ""Wish you were here"" album. But ""Roller"" comes across kind of lame. I had Roller for a while and tried so hard to get into it but ended up trading it away for ""Martian Chronicles"" by Solaris. For Goblin, definitely check out ""Suspiria"" which rates about ***1/2. I don't understand the hype about Roller. However, I definitely recommend ""Cherry Five"" as it's better than anything Goblin ever did (IHMO)."
5,Strong Exposition Footage,I found this to be a bit of a novelty DVD. The films are very old and somewhat grainy and they document two fairs from the turn of the century that are not very well known.On the other hand they are interesting in the sense that you get a good sense of how these people wanted to present their city to the world and the golden gate bridge shots are absolutely stunning.The amount of organzation that went into these events is impressive as was the way it is documented.
4,good text for the spine,I found this text easier to read than the Frymoyer. Probably the best one out there now.
1,Not the easiest way to learn about spine,I found this spine text incredibly hard to read. I learned much more from reading other shorter texts.
3,I couldn't follow the diet portion,This is a book with some helpful hints...although it is really hard to follow. The excersise tips are great. I don't think I'm really qualified to rate this book as well as other fitness books. It is def a book for someone who is just starting out and wants to lose weight and gain muscle.
5,Finally! A Weight Loss Program that Makes Sense!,"I love this book! It is simple to follow, makes sense and feels like it is personalized just for me! What a great concept. All I need is right in the book - what to eat, how to exercise, menus and even a tracking system that can help me hold myself accountable to my commitment. It offers the equivalent of a dietician, personal trainer and life coach all in one package. Genius!!"
1,disappointed in performance,"Unfortunately I was disappointed in the performance. The features and settings of this wireless router appealed to my application, but it could not transmit or receive reliably. It's usable range is significantly smaller than other routers of the same grade/price range."
1,don't buy this router,"It's not plug and play, the setup is unnecessarily complicated. The included instructions are completely useless. After spending a great deal of time setting the product up, it now doesn't work. Shop elsewhere for a router."
4,Happy and Cant Wait to Wear It,"I havent worn it out yet but I plan to at my 21st birthday party. I think It will add a nice sparkle to my dress along with other accessories.I like the size of the ring and diamonds. Not too big and not too small. I did place it on my finger and it looks adorable.I hope I dont have any problems with the diamond falling out like other customers. I'll update if I do, otherwise its holding up great!"
5,Cheap but not cheap looking,We were very impressed with the bling for the cost. This ring is well worth the price. We would buy it again.
5,Lovely Ring,"perfict size and it absolutely shines! I usally wear a size 7.5 but the 7 fits great, so order accordingly."
3,nice ring,"this ring is really lovely, but it's nothing special. The band is very thin, which is contrary to what the picture would lead you to believe. It was delivered very quickly which was awesome."
2,Looks fake to me.....,Surprised after all of the great reviews that this ring wasn't as realistic as I thought it would be. It is too bright and clear and next to my real diamond just looks so different. The size is big for a seven - I can wear this on my middle finger instead of my ring finger which is normally a seven. It is not a ring that I would recommend.
3,Very lovely ring,"It looks very good, but the stones are too large to look like real gems. If you want more of a costume jewelry look, it would be great."
2,Stones are beautiful,"I ordered this ring as an impulse and am really disappointed. You get what you pay for. The stoes are beautiful and bright with fantastic sparkle. The band and settings are thin and make the ring appear fake and cheap. I returned it. Also, the sizing runs big. I ordered a 6 and it spun completely around."
5,Looks real,I've had several people ask me whether this ring is real. The stones are very sparkly and the thin band is comfortable.
2,Ring Sizement,I am not forsure this ring is an actual size 9 because i am a size 9 ring size and this ring is a tight fit!
5,CZ Ring,"I gave this ring a shot at around $12.00, I know my jewlery, can't buy a real diamond ring at this price--the ring is quite pretty, very sparkly--people think it's real, I wear it and love it!"
5,Beautiful !,"Beautiful, outstanding, perfect, fantastic, describes this ring. I have a small hand ( size 5) and its so hard finding a ring that doesnt look monsterous and fake... this one fills the bill perfectly. It has larger stones, but not so big that they look like my hand needs help to hold it up. I have a real one, but cant wear it cause I have lost a lot of weight and it doesnt fit anymore...so I wanted something that looked fantastic and this is it ! I had purchased one somewhere else, and it had to go back..looked like pure junk. This ring is just lovely...really. Im sure it would look lovely on a large hand too. It is shiny and bright.. just what I wanted. The price, are you kidding me ! This is a no brainer folks. Get it while you can. Im so glad I did."
5,You get what you pay for.,"For an inexpensive CZ ring, it's exactly what I expected. The gems are a little too sparkly to be real diamonds, but it's a very pretty ring. My wife is wearing it while she loses the baby weight that forced her to stop wearing her real engagement ring. She's happy to have a ""diamond"" ring again. It made a great, unexpected stocking stuffer for Christmas."
2,3 stoned ring,"Band is really skinny, box that ring was shipped in had a small bag that ring was tucked into liner almost didn't relize something was in pouch. Stones are to large for band they sit on"
4,Amazing,"I love it, it really made my mom happy because she always wanted a ring like that. Thank you so much"
4,VERY pleased,"bought this ring because i wash my hands about 4 times an hour at work and dread dropping my real ring somewhere, so this is lovely, and if it goes down a drain, i won't be distraught!"
1,Cheap looking and poorly made,"I was very disappointed with this ring. All three stones were different sizes and looked extremely fake. I don't understand why other reviewers said this could pass as the real thing, but it's differently cheap looking. Quite a shame as it looked nice in the picture."
1,Wasn't happy with the ring.,The stones in the ring looked fake. They sent me the wrong size. Wasn't happy .
1,not what expected,"This item is not the same as the photo. The stones are smaller than the description states and CHINA is stamped on the inside of the band and whatever the finish is- its flaking off. Very unhappy with it, certainly not what I expected."
2,nope,"its nice at first glance, once you look at it for a bit you can notice the sliver isn't too smooth and not completely shiny around around the ring.. the CZ stones look amazing! its good for a play ring or a travel ring... but not a great gift!! On someones hand it would look nice to 95% of people around her. spend about $30-50 for a nice CZ,silver ring.. thats what i ended up doing ."
2,Look fake and size is not very accurate,"It's an OK ring if you just want big accessories.However, the stones are too big and look very fake (of course), and it makes me feel shallow...Besides, the size is a bit bigger than normal ring size. So order 1 size down if you do want to keep it (I didn't)."
4,Bigger than picture,"Bright, shiney, stones look bigger than in picture - at least if the ring is a size 5. Band is thin/narrow. Wish I could have gotten a size 4, but it wasn't available at the time. Other than that, very nice looking ring"
3,Bold and shinny,"The stones are bigger than I expected, I normally wear a size 8 ring but this was big on my finger unlike my other size 8 rings. I would never wear this everyday but I've always admired this style so for the price I thought I could pull it off without the big price tag. I'd go down a size when ordering this ring."
1,Waste of money,"While the ring looked nice, its cheaply-made setting snagged on fabrics and things, and one of the stones has fallen out already and is nowhere to be found. This was a total waste of money, in my opinion."
3,It is what it is,"I bought this ring for my wife as a little joke because she lost one of the diamonds out of her wedding ring. She has been saying she will take it in to the jeweler to have the stone replaced for months now. She still wears a band that I bought her but her finger looks so bare without her wedding ring. I am going to sneak it out of her jewelry box and have it repaired for Christmas. I saw this product and thought it would be a fun little substitute while her wedding ring is in limbo. This ring isn't meant to fool anyone which is a good thing as it is not likely to. Also, the band began to tarnish after a few days of wear (also not a big deal but thought it was worth mentioning for the review). All in all I would say it is worth what I paid for it and is about what I expected for the price."
2,Sparkles Like a CZ,"There is no mistaking that this ring is made from cubic zirconia, and there is no chance that a person who knows, even a little, about gemstones would mistake it for diamonds. When the stones are viewed in the center (from above), there is no depth to them. They are highly faceted, so they artificially pick up every color of the rainbow. The CG image shown by Amazon.com is better looking than the actual ring. Two stars for correct fit and nice setting, but this ring is being returned."
4,Anillo,"Anillo muy bonito, piedras bien engastadas, de aspecto claro y muy limpio. Elegante,sencillo y a un buen precio. Lo recomiendo"
2,"Beautiful, but stones seem too big to look real.","I think this is a really beautiful ring and the CZs are bright and sparkly, but I won't wear it anywhere because the size of the stones make it look like it isn't real to me. I have a smaller CZ ring in sterling silver and I wear it all the time. I was hoping this would be about a 1 carat center stone with 1/2 carat size on the sides. I think that size would look more like real diamonds."
5,Anniversary ring,"I bought the sterling silver cubic zirconia ring to wear with my wedding band for our 69th wedding anniversary. Since I have 2 beautiful antique diamond rings for my pinky fingers, I wanted something nice but inexpensive. This is just what I wanted. It looks beautiful and I love it."
4,Fabulous,"I received my ring this morning and it is exactly as described and I am thrilled with it. Would definitely recommend and it has been received much quicker than expected, excellent service."
5,Perfect,I was looking for something that was not too big and not too small. This is perfect and looks beautiful on the hand.
5,Absolutely Stunning!,This ring is absolutely beautiful! Ordered a 6 it fit perfectly (is true to size) The complements haven't stopped since I slipped it on my finger!
5,Using it while pregnant,"My wedding ring didn't fit me after my first trimester. Found this ring on Amazon, very reasonably priced and I love it. It's beautiful. None of my friends and family can tell the difference between this one and my wedding ring that is real diamonds. Makes me think we wasted a lot of money on the original wedding ring!!"
2,Gawwwdddddyyyyy!!!,"This might be ok on a larger woman... My fingers are long and slender (size 4.5). I am not a tiny woman but average size. A real ring this size would exceed the value of most newer cars, and it just isn't very real looking. Going to return it"
3,ok ring,"i expected more from this ring, i can find this kind of ring in some fashion store for 10$....but oh well i like it cause m husband gave it to me"
3,pretty..not quite as good as other reviews say,"well, I have gotten at least one compliment on this ring each time I have worn it, and would have probably given it 3 1/2 stars if I could, but I guess I don't think it's as nice as the rest of the reviewers. It's pretty, but it doesn't look like real diamonds in my opinion. I think it looks like it should cost about 40 bucks, and since I paid less than 20, I feel like I got a good deal. It also seems to run a little bit big. It did come in a nice velvet bag and box. Overall, it's a nice ring, and a good price. The setting is simple, which I like, and the stones are a good size.(some of these 3 stone rings have huge stones that don't look good on smaller hands). Still, I don't think you can pass it off as real diamonds if that's your goal. If you want just a pretty fashion ring...then this will do fine."
2,Lasted 3 months,"I probably should have taken it off when I washed my hands. The silver or whatever started rubbing off and it looked not so good. I had lost my real diamond and was using this as a replacement. For the money, I was hoping it would last longer. But, to my surprise my husband bought me a new diamond for Christmas! This looked really nice at first, but I would definitely take it off before putting your hands in water for any reason or doing any kind of work. Just wear it when you need to and store it when not in use. I probably could have gotten more use out of it."
4,Very Nice Quality for Price,"This is a very realistic looking 3 stone CZ ring. I estimate a total Carat weight equivalent of about 2.25. My only complaint is that the the stones are not quite as wide-set as I was expecting from the picture. They do not cover the entire top of my finger. However, the overall quality and value of this purchase was excellent."
3,"Pretty, but not fooling anyone.","This ring is very pretty, but obviously fake. If I saw this ring in the store I probably would not buy it. I would go to a department store and browse their rings before buying this one. They are about the same price and would probabaly make someone wonder more than this one would."
2,Looks too cheap and fake to me!,First thing I have ordered that I wanted to return to Amazon. It was too fake and cheap looking in my opinion.
3,Too shiney,"This ring looks like it came out of a gumball machine, it is way too shiney, I say too shiney as it glows compared to my sterling silver rings. I was hoping to wear it with nice everyday work clothes but it looks like rhinestones & should be on a disco ball."
5,Beautiful!,"Gorgeous Ring!! It is very believable, which is what I was looking for. I find myself staring at it because of the sparkle and shine."
5,Awesome,I love this ring. I stands out just enough for people to notice. The price was also Awesome!! I plan to purchase more in the near future.
5,This is a beautiful ring...,"Very shiny, bright and fits perfectly.Very shiny, bright and fits perfectly.Very shiny, bright and fits perfectly.Very shiny, bright and fits perfectly."
3,good for the price,"glad I only paid 12 bucks for this. It's a nice ring but it looks totally fake, I've been wearing it though, it's a nice addition to my jewelery collection. Worth it for the price"
5,Amazing BLING!!!!,"This ring is definitly worth the purchase. I was AMAZED by the the beauty of this ring when I first opened my package and then when my husband placed the ring upon my finger...I was teary eyed. This is a wonderfully created product that makes a clear statement of ""look at my beauty and shine"". I could not be happier, unless of course if it were true diamonds. I am extremely satisfide with the price, quality, and statement it makes by being what it is and for now allowing me to wear the beauty of my wedding band. God Bless.Thank you so much.Happy Customer, NCP.S. My husband thanks you for saving his wallet. Will be looking for the real diamonds in the future once our debts lessen and we can put our dollars toward such an investment."
2,"Nice ring, but these Zirconia stones are not even close to real diamonds","I've always read that Cubic Zirconia is so close to diamonds in its attributes - almost everything excluding strenght, origin and price of course- and I have actually several good pieces of jewelry with Cubic Zirconia and with diamonds and they look very similar to naked eye.I've got this ring and it is actually a nice one, however it is not even close to real diamond's luminosity, sparkle and shade. It just look like a well polished clear glass or crystal.Picture it's just too sharp and the real one is just ""too fake"" to be a diamond one and at the same time with too big pretentions to be a simple silver ring to wear with casual-sport apparel. I would feel pretty uncomfortable wearing it. I was a bit dissapointed when finally got this ring."
2,Not so great anymore!,"SO i purchased this ring a few months ago just to wear as a ploy to keep men from bothering me..its dont the trick until recently. The ""diamonds"" are very foggy looking no matter how i clea them and it is changing colors and the stones are very loose. I would say great ring if you are only planning to wear it for the short term but not a longterm every day wear."
5,miss anne marie,i love the ring it shines beautiful its looks so real anyone who like to buy one this is the ring the stones are a good size my friends love the ring it could pass for a real diamond i love the ring its worth the money its better then the ring i bought from avon it was silver and had cubic z no shine to the ring but this ring i bought with the 3 stones its worth the price anne marie
4,cute,"i just received this ring,it looks very cute on my finger,great for that low price! looks exactly like the picture"
4,Attention grabbing ring!,"I love this ring, it is so comfortable and even more sparkly in person. It may be cubic zirconia, but it sure doesn't look it. I have gotten tons of compliments on it. And I love the way the three stones are set!"
2,CZ 3 stone Ring,The CZ's are shiny and the ring is pretty overall and probably worth the price to most people. Size 5 was perfect!
3,Stones are too big for every day wear.,"This ring is very beautiful and real looking, but I wanted to be able to wear it everyday as a ""No Pest Strip"". The stones are just too large for everyday, I feel like a show-off! It looks great when I'm dressed up, though!"
1,Get what you pay for,"I was really excited to order this ring after reading all of the glowing reviews but when I received it I was very disapointed however, for the price what did I expect? Picture looks WAY better than the real thing!"
4,cheap but nice,"this ring is as the other ratings say. It shines beautifully and looks real from a distance. It does say ""China"" on the inside, but you wont notice that when the ring it on. It looks like an engagement ring and could pass as a cheap one. It looks like it could be around $50 store price because of the diamonds not looking real up close. but it is definitely worth the $17+ to buy it."
4,Beautiful ring.,This ring was a Christmas present to myself. I really enjoy it and have had numerous comments about how lovely it is. Thank you Amazon.
2,Very Shiny,I did not like the ring and it looks extremely fake and it shines too much! Not a worth to buy
5,Cool,"Arrived promptly and just as it is on the internet.Its simple, cool and lovely. Something different from the usual engagement rings.It was bought in November 2012.My fiancee loves it."
2,it looks really cheap,it doesn't look anything like the picture. it looks cheap! but then again you get what you pay for right? what was i thinking?
2,I can do better!,"I don't like it all, I'm going to return it. Even for the price I paid, it's not worth it!"
5,Beautiful Ring,"I would recommend this ring to anybody,and although it isn't a real diamond,people think that it is,the quality is excellent !!!! Thanks to amazon and the sellers for this lovely ring,and i plan on buying alot more in the near future for sure !!!!"
1,Sent it back,"I ordered this item because it was supposed to be a fake/stand-in for my real engagement ring while in Mexico. However, it didn't arrive until after we got back from our vacation, when it was supposed to arrive the week before we left. I was highly disappointed."
5,Fantastic,"I'm happy buying the CD's from Accardo, only see Accardo in the CD-Case and you know, something good is inside there. Now talking about this particular CD, is amazing the Max Bruch work. Accardo playing incredible the third concert, a beautiful concert, like the other reviewers I agree, that this concert must be included in the violinist repertoire. Why always the #1 Concert of Bruch, Why always the Wieniawski #2, if those composers has other big master works. Now the technich of the violinist like the the materials of his strings, help so much to perform this works. A Bravo for Mr. Accardo in the release of this work. Accardo is a big master of the violin, and always you could associate with Paganini works, but is incredible listen him in other master works, like Bruch, Wieniawski, etc. I hope that he include in his futures CD's unknown concerts for the public in general like Fiorillo, Rode, Viotti, etc."
4,works fine,"Of the natural tampons I've tried they are my favorites. The applicator is hassle free (slides easily) and the tampons doesn't leave lint behind (both problems with Seventh Generation tampons). The only complaint(aside from price, but the bulk pricing here is decent) is that the labeling of absorbency seems off, where the super feels more like a regular and the regular more like a lite. And they don't seem to sell super plus with applicator, which is inconvenient. Leakage isn't a particular problem for me, I only have 1 heavy day where that's a possibility. I know they aren't perfect but the trade-offs aren't that bad."
5,great product,"I was very happy to find this organic option after reading about the damages that conventional cotton and cotton products cause both in the environment and in the human body. (Cotton is one of the worlds most fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide intensive crop. Scorching the soil, contaminating the water and food supply).This is a very good quality, substitute for regular cotton tampons.On the side note: The seize described as, small, medium, super are slightly smaller than the conventional cotton tampons. So, you might want to purchase a larger seize than your usual.The only thing I would (and did) complain about is the shipping package. It is weigh overpacked, (in double cardboard box) for an environmentally concious product. I hope a lot of people will complain about that so they'll reconsider the packaging."
3,not so wonderful,U know those tampons u get at dollar tree. Sorta like a lux one of those. My goal was to use less tampons thru the day 2 save money. But I felt I had 2 use more
1,"HORRIBLE, ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE","never ever works! I've had this tv for 3 months, and i cant even get a DVD to play anymore. it used to just skip all the time, taking about 10 tries to finally get a DVD to play, now they wont play at all. it keeps giving me the error: please insert a playable disc!!! i even tried putting in a dvd that i watched previously on this tv. its a piece of junk. And i took it to get repaired, the warranty doesnt include labor! and they said nothing was wrong with it. so i wasted fifty bucks for nothing. And!!!!!!!!!!! when i watch tv half the time i dont get a color picture. DONT BUY THIS TV"
1,Sylvania products break often and early,"Do not buy this product. Do not buy any Sylvania products. The DVD player will break several times before and after the one year warranty has expired. My family purchased a Sylvania TV/DVD combo and have had nothing but trouble with it. The TV is fine, but the DVD player breaks every 5-6 months. We have only had it a year and a month and already it has been in the shop twice. Labor is not covered by the way. Do not waste your money!"
2,You get what you pay for...,"I got this TV in exchange for the Toshiba 14 inch combo (MD14FN1) which I had returned under a warranty plan SIX times before the ""best"" mall store would replace it. Same problem: the DVD player malfunctioned, but not at the store. I resorted to videotaping the problem. When I received this TV I thought they'd given me an open box item - the packing was damaged and there is no product registration card. BUT - that's how they all come. I buy widescreen movies and switch back and forth between letterbox and full screen. On this TV that feature doesn't work at all! Followed the instructions to the letter with no success. However, I did buy a warranty for this one, so I am doing research before this TV (inevitably) malfunctions, and I'll ask for a reliable replacement.PROSNice picture, headphone jack, and maybe it will last a few months before I have to go back to the mall store. The Toshiba malfunctioned monthly."
1,Save your money,"Save your money! I read that this unit was a reliable although not top-of-the-line DVD burner, but after having it installed for a week, it is hard to tell anything about this drive is. The Nero 6 Memorex Suite that ships with this unit literally crashes my computer with every fifth or sixth click of the mouse - something that other reviewers have reported. I really don't see how Memorex can expect to sell units with this software package. Similarly, I don't see how Nero can expect someone to purchase an upgrade to a buggy program - its throwing good money after bad. Two thumbs down!"
5,Superb DVD Recorder,"I've been using this drive for more than 7 months now, and I don't have any single complaint about it. It's fast, reliable, and has a cool design, although I don't get to see it cause my HP computer case covers the drive with it's bay door (The blue light is cool tough).I have yet to burn a dual layer DVD, but the speed is good for single-layer ones. Also, I was even able to read some scratched DVD's my old DVD-Rom would not read.And the price is excellent. A great choice for an internal DVD burner."
3,Good while it lasted,"I purchased two of these drives sometime in 2007. One was the internal version and the other the USB external. Both used the same drive which is labelled MRX-510L. Since then I have used them fairly regularly to burn all varieties and brands of discs. These included various el-cheapo no-name RW CD's and DL DVD's. Over the years I don't think I had more than two bad burns. Unlike other drives that can be picky about which brands is likes or doesn't, the Memorex drive was a reliable workhorse. However, about six months ago BOTH began to get obstinate about opening the drawers. First, they were a little sluggish, but eventually no amount of coaxing would work. The drawers are stuck closed. Like forever. So, it was a good run while it lasted, but these things are not built to last more than a few years. Dock two stars for lack of long-term reliability."
4,"Good Drive, Bogus Software","I like the drive. it works well for my simple needs.but most of the included nero software expires and they want more money. all that works now is the simple burning tool. i would rather have a 'lesser' version of the nero software than a full version that i cannot use after couple months.so be warned if you want to author dvd's and many other things, the software will expire."
4,Cant beat it for the price.,Cant beat this drive for the price. The only downfall is amazons slow shipping. After waiting a week I got an email that it was on back order and it took about 4 or 5 days after that to get.
4,Great but not very absorbant,"Very pleased that Amazon offers a natural, organic tampon in bulk. Where I live, chlorine free tampons are hard to find and very expensive. I was a bit disappointed in the absorbancy, however. It says ""regular"" but is more comparable to a tampax ""light"". Next time I will buy ""super"""
1,Horrible,Great product if you like having the cheap cardboard applicator break off deep inside of you. I do not recommend this to anybody. Stay away.
1,I wish it worked...,"I'm a feminine hygiene connoisseur and I've tried my fair share of different and alternative menstrual products. When it comes to health conscious feminine hygiene products I'm willing to forgo some connivence knowing that what I'm using is overall a safer option, but that said, Natracare really wasn't worth it at all for me. The tampon absorbency is dismal and leaks are almost guaranteed. I love that the cotton in this product is organic, I love that the cotton wasn't bleached, I love that Natracare has a non-application tampon option. Sadly, amid all these great things, Natracare is simply not a good performer."
2,Not sure what the difference is,"Yes, I bought tamps online...with 3 women in my home, I'd buy a whole years worth to never have to worry about running out of this pretty essential product. After researching this brand and reading about how the expanded shape is superior to the typical store brand, I was a bit disappointed that I did not notice any difference between this brand and the typical store brand I normally purchase. Note, I did not say 'the leading national brand', I said 'store brand'. I'm not so sure their claims are legit, and I'm not sure it's worth it to pay a premium for this product. While buying them online is great, again, I did not notice a difference between this brand and its store brand counterpart."
3,A skull cracker,"The story gets intensely wrapped up in its explanation of the universe, much to the detriment of what is really interesting. At times I was reminded of reading Frank Herbert's ""Destination Void"" where long passages are devoted to jargon filled essays. The problem in this type of work is that the characters are flattened to two dimensions under the weighty arguments, and the plot becomes nothing more than functional.The way that Hendirx jumps back and forth over a period of 30 years doesn't help. It puts quite a demand of concentration on the reader (not necessarily a bad thing).I can't blame him for trying; anyone who loves science and the truly exciting things happening currently in biology and cosmology will appreciate this book. In spite of the recent (2001) copyright he seems to be a few years out of date with regard to the latest of string theory, but that doesn't matter.Any library of current SF should have this book."
2,Disappointing Read,"This story drifts along at a leisurely pace, never quite getting exciting, never quite getting mysterious. If it pleases you to be able to relax with a book where you never wonder what is going to happen next, I highly recommend this book. Actually, I would also recommend this book to anyone who is used to reading good science fiction / near future apocalypse type material. This book will remind you how good other books were and can be.If this is the kind of story you're interested in, but you want more exciting writing pick up William Gibson or better yet almost anything by Neal Stephenson."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"This book was the most pretentious thing I've ever read. There were made up words on literally every page of this monstrosity, believe me, I tried to look them up in a dictionary.The shamanistic thing is completely nonsensical and self indulgent. The character of the ""evil mastermind"" is incoherent. The dialogue doesn't move the story forward and is so juvenile it makes you cringe repeatedly.I would tell you not to read this book but now that I think of it, it was so bad it was good!"
3,good,"Saved babies daddies is the story of Zakia, who become save after getting pregnant. The book show's through Zakia some everyday problems that chrisitan women go through."
2,A misleading title,"In researching origami projects for young children I picked up this book from my library. The title of the book is VERY misleading. After flipping through the book I found maybe 6 actual origami projects, while the rest were generic paper crafts.So I do NOT recommend this book to other readers and people interested in origami. There are other, far better books to get."
4,A little gem of a candy making pot,"Yes, yes, yes, it takes a long time to melt the chocolate, but once it is melted the constant low temperature is perfect for dipping. I make a lot home made truffles for Christmas gifts and appreciate the creamy chocolate texture this little pot can supply over a two hour period.Why am I singing it's praises? I broke the little ceramic crock in the middle of making truffles this year and bought and used another brand. The new brand did not keep the even temperature as well as this little guy.If you want to melt chocolate fast, use the microwave or stove method. But if you want to make chocolate dipped candy, buy this little gem."
2,works well but very small capacity,I thought it would be good for heating chocolate for the Sephra fountain. It's really very small and therefore has limited usefullness.
4,Better than 2 cups of coffee,A truly hot compilation of the most up tempo Mozart tunes. Just the ticket to get the blood moving in the a.m. Not a single downer in the bunch!
5,Lively Mozart compositions to get you going on Monday AM,"My wife is a school teacher. and she already owns ""Mozart for your mind,"" which is classical music that is supposed to help you concentrate more. This cd represents some of the more lively arrangements in the Mozart repetoire, and my wife enjoys this one, too. Actually, so do I. I am a newbie when it comes to classical music, but I am liking it more and more, and in large part to this Mozart music cd. The songs are familiar, probably from hearing them as the backdrops to animated cartoons and major motion pictures. But I enjoy these renditions by The Academy of St. Martin in the Fields and the English Chamber Orchestra, among others.If you don't any classical music and you're wondering where to start, this is a good place right here."
5,Wood Ivy,"This is the second Pentacle necklace from Dan's Jewelers that I have purchased and I must say that I am more impressed with this one than the other one I purchased. On mine, it doesn't look as silver as the picture on the Amazon site, however the darker metal with black on the 'woodgrain' is actually a plus. Overall, I am satisfied with the product and would definitely buy this product again if it were lost or stolen."
1,Missing parts,"This item was missing some of the attachement brackets. We were able to use one, so we didn't return it. Just really annoying that a company would ship out an incomplete product....not sure if it was the manufacturer or store?"
2,Too Short,"I was pretty disappointed with this product. Once assembled, the ""legs"" were too short -- my hanging files were dragging on the bottom of the file drawer. I don't think I would buy this product again."
2,Complex construction and missing pieces,I needed these for a drawer in my desk that didn't have the built in file folder brackets. I received the package and quickly realized that #1 there were missing pieces (all the black connector pieces you see in the picture) and #2 you need a hammer and pliers to mold the metal to your desired shape and size and make the connections. This is not an easy structure to build. I returned the piece the day I received it (and would have regardless of the missing pieces).
2,Not Legal Size,"The drawer frame was incorrectly described; it is not legal size compatible. The U-Shaped underside is letter-sized and prevents legal sized hangers from being installed. However, product was easy-to-assemble."
1,Not worth the money,"The Tutti Dolci Fantasia Di Cioccolata 2.5 oz is VERY small and NOT worth the money that they advertise on amazon. Also, I did not like the packaging..there was no covering over the product which made me a little suspicious of who used the product before I purchased it.MLB"
5,some very good arguments,"Boy, this guy really has a hard-on for marriage. It's cool though; he presents all of his arguments (very good ones, by the way) in a clear concise way which explains the compact nature of this book. It's a pretty easy read, I think I finished it in a day, but that's not to say that the content is light. Jonathan Rauch raised questions that most people haven't even thought of in the marriage debate. And while he takes the most inoffensive route when describing ""same-sex marriage opponents"" I almost wish he would say ""religious right-wing nutjobs."" For the life of me I cannot figure out why people who proclaim that they want to ""protect"" marriage would try to keep people FROM marrying. If you're going to defend marriage shouldn't you protect it from divorce? Anyway, this book is rather good although a little too assimilationist for me."
1,Ride It For All It's Worth!,"This book, along with HUNDREDS of others, are basically beating a ""dead horse"". Everyone has pretty much made up their mind on where they stand on the same sex marriage issue. Books like this one are intended for nothing else than for a select few to make a buck. (aurthor, publisher, etc) It will pander to gays if they seem like likely marks to make a purchase. Most people will buy things if it pertains to them, much like poeple who sale all the silly over-priced souveniers at sports events. People will spend money to show their support. The people selling the items probably do not even care WHAT they are selling, just that people buy. Homosexuals and Heterosexuals do have one thing in common...they will BOTH be manipulated into buying books like this one. This books says the same thing everyone else is saying on various talk shows and what have you. Save your money."
3,"If you Are gay, Don't bother /w the book","I got a little over half way through the book, before I finally just pit it away. The target for this book is really more for straight people who are maybe just on the fence about Gay marriage.The first couple chapters, too me just seemed like he was mainly trying to convene the reading that Two people of the same Sex really can be in Love with each other.So if you are indeed gay yourself (Like me) there really is not much to gain from the book.I only got it to research and get some Ammo from it, in case i ever got backed into a corner and ended up trying debit myself and feels with someone who did not accept it.But If you are a parent of a Gay Child, I think this book could be of some use too you.But for someone who is gay, it really well not keep your attention. Cuz its really selling the idea of are right to be married. And if your gay you dont someone to sell the idea too you. for your bought it the moment you stepped out of the closet."
5,a must read for every thinking American......,"Well written with historical facts of society and human dignity. Every one who thinks he/she is a free thinking, authentic human being believing in the constitution of this country needs to read, meaditate and take some social action with the powers that be. We are all one in God...created equal...this write encourages one to be their authentic self when it comes to living in a democracy as a human being with the ability to think. Compassinate and touches the core of the controversy between the so called gays and straights. Let's learn to be human beings and live peacefully with one another."
5,Belongs in every public library,"Every public library must have a copy of this book to provide researchers, especially students, with the best data and information to do a thorough study of the subject. As a librarian, I can highly recommend this title as an excellent choice for libraries without a lot of money to spend providing books on every topic. This one is essential for all collections."
3,Mixed review,"Good book. The exercises are good but a bit frustrating because you will often have to go back to find where in the chapter the specific topic was discussed, as opposed to having a section number listed by each problem. Things are well-explained though, aside from this bit of difficulty."
2,The backwards book for biostatistics,"At the time I was taking bio-statistics for my MPH at Harvard School of Public Health, a friend was taking a different class using this book. I ended up buying it, but only as a reference. Althought the material is all here, the organization is scrambled with theory intermixed with the example that starts the topic discussion - some may like this, but personally it drives me crazy. At the end of the semester, I had a wonderful grasp of statistics, and my friend was pulling his hair out. One real plus of this book is that the index includes the clinical examples that generate the discussion, so I do use this book as a reference for ""like-problems""."
1,Uncle!,"I finally had to admit to myself that I had no desire to read any more of this book.In theory, a behind-the-scenes look at Verne'sAround the World in 80 Daysis engrossing. According to Farmer, Fogg really made the trip to further the interests of the Eridani; as part of the secret ongoing Eridani-Capellan war. However, as I have found with many of Farmer's books: the idea is genius - but the execution leaves much to be desired."
4,Verne-like feel,"Farmer seems to capture Verne's take on Britishism, at least as I recall from reading Around the World years ago. Into an already highly implausible story, Farmer weaves an even more implausible story, where two alien races compete for control of Earth and communicate through card games. If that's not wacky enough, perhaps you will see characters from other Verne novels make an appearance."
2,Plastic!,"Nice-looking watch, but, unbelievably, the strap buckle is PLASTIC. That's right -- Seiko has made this watch with a plastic buckle, which is to say the least not what I expected from this brand, even for $95. The crappy old $35 Timex that I bought this to replace even had a metal buckle on the strap for Pete's sake."
5,Nice watch!,"This is your everyday dress watch. It is reliable, looks good and it is not too flashy. It fits comfortably and it is not too big."
3,Wish it would install easier,"I like the fact that this give me more needed counter space in the camper. However, it just sits on the sink it is hard to install so it fits tight in the sink so it doesn't move all around."
5,CROSSROADS B/W ASIA AND THE WESTERN WORLD,"Ted Lerner captures Manila and the Philippines like no other author that I've read. He obviously lives there and knows the markets, the culture and customs, religion and the spirtual, the night life, and everything in between Asia meeting the Western World. Though the Philippines has had strong influences from the Spanish, Japan and America, there is still a special uniqueness of the people, mostly speaking English and very friendly. I liked Ted's book and I believe you will also. If you travel to a National/Robinson's bookstore in Manila, I believe you'll find it in stock."
2,Wishing it was like my previous D-Core product!,I have only had it for less then two moths and it is not like the last one i ordered... not impressed with this model #.
1,ick.,"I loved the concept of this pillow and still like how it is shaped, however it is sooo hard and soooooooo firm I get headaches and worse neck pain than with other pillows I have purchased. This would be great if it wasn't so HARD. You might as well roll up a stiff towel and put it under your neck~that's alot cheaper."
3,"It's ""Ok.""","The pillow was a little harder than I thought it would be and therefore not as comfortable as I would like, but the design is a good one."
2,It was Good at First,The pillow was good for about a month and then began to lose its shape. I would not get another one.
1,a very evil book!,This book didn't cover half the information that was included in my school's curriculum. it didn't go into detail about many important details of bio. this book is probably outdated since it would not contain information about the completion of chromosome 22 and other important leaps in biology. the authors can not be blamed since it was written in 1994. get the newer books that are in print. (ex. Barron's & Kaplan's new books)
5,"good quality, good look, good price","This watch was everything I'd hoped for. It looks much nicer than the picture online. Its a great weight and feel and all of the functions work well. The rubber band fit my wrist well and comfortably. There's nothing special about it, its just a great watch."
3,Nice but Expensive,I had to pay a lot on postage and custom duty+Vat on top of the price as product was not available in UK. Anyhow I loved the model so I paid for it
2,Good story idea,Great story - Disappointed in the emotional sensibilities of the characters and neurotic behavior - I loved the story though!
4,Good quality but few things may be improved,"Overall this 30 lb feeder with pan is good quality and design. However there have few stuff may be improved as my personal experience. 1. Cover: it should come with top cover to block the sparrows or the chicks jump into the feeder, eat and poop inside. 2. The wall on the base pen should be higher to prevent the chicken spelling the feed out. 3. The space on the base pen should be bigger so the adult chicken can eat easier especially the adult rooster with big comb."
3,Decent Product,"Well-made product. Too big for my needs. Should have included a cover - or at least have the option of buying one from the same source as shipping is more than the cost of the cover. Birds like to sit on the upper rim...food can get really ""dirty."""
4,"Nice watch, bad alarm, poor warranty","Heavy, well made and very attractive watch. Alarm failed after two and half years, and was sent to Seiko under warranty. However, Seiko determined that the problem was with the case (which is NOT covered by warranty) rather than the movement, which is, and wanted $169 for the new case. Since the watch is still functional and water resistant I declined.I only use the alarm as a second time zone watch, and it can still be set for that purpose, so the watch is still usable."
3,Grey or Counterfeit?,"No certificate for warranty provided. Online searches suggest this is a sign the the watch is a ""grey"" watch - made by OEM but has no coverage or is a counterfeit. Seems this is a common practice and links to the low price. Be careful!"
5,nice watch great company service,A very stunning looking watch .I had to add two links to the bracelet an a local store requested them from Seiko. They also send to them a 15 year old Seiko of mine with a broken bracelet. I got the links and my old watch with a new bracelet at no cost to me. What a great company. Try calling the company that sells Akribos xxIV watches located in NYC Horrible to deal with. Do yourself a favor an buy a Seiko
5,A top quality watch,"This is my second Seiko. I still have my first. With this watch I see some well thought out improvements. The crown and both side mounted push buttons lock. This feature is long overdue in my opinion. This prevents accidental activation of the stop watch , or advancement of the time on the alarm. On the down side I found the owners manual a little vague, and lacking in instruction compared to the manual I got with my original Seiko. Also, I had to pay to have my band sized. On the original Seiko I bought, there were many adjustments available. Over all, I love this watch. It is beautiful, functions flawlessly, and has a very good feel to it."
2,Golden color wears off - not for everyday use,"I also bought the SNA413 at the same time (silver with white dial). I used to like the golden one better because it looked more classy and white hands on a black dial are easier to see than white hands on a white dial (SNA413).However, the golden color rubs off and as a result, after only a couple of years, the watch is no longer very presentable. I hardly wear it anymore.On a positive note, I shower and swim and dive with my watches and in about 5 years of use I have not had any water in either.Mechanically, this watch is on the lower end of the quality spectrum.Overall, I don't recommend gold tone stainless steel for a watch that is worn daily, because once the gold wears off it makes you look like you wanted a golden watch but couldn't afford one."
4,Year two and still going strong...,"I bought this watch for myself almost two years ago now and it is still one of my favorites (in fact, I wore it today and already received a compliment from one of my co-workers).I bought this watch for basically two reasons... ""looks"" and the Seiko reputation. I'm as still as satisfied with the watch today as the day I purchased it. This watch is definitely a ""Mans Watch"". It is large and VERY gold (much more so than I originally thought). Sometimes it is more ""bling"" than I want and opt for something a little less obtrusive and ""less"" gold! Accuracy is phenomenal, in almost two years it has lost less than 1 minute!Only negative would be the size. If you are a small person or have small wrists, this watch would be ""too"" large. Overall VERY satisfied and happy with the purchase"
2,"no factory warranty, alarm does not operate properly",alarm not loud enough to be heard. i had the watch checked at a seiko repair facility and was advised it was defective and to return it with the warranity card. the warranty card is blank and the watch is not covered under factory warranty. seiko advised that the watches sold in this manner are mostly factory rejects and have some form of operational problems. good luck if you purchase this product.
5,I read this book twenty years ago and still can't forget it.,"This book seems to be a masterpiece in scholarship and imagination. It helped me visualize what a holistic culture must have been like and it helped me appreciate how much wisdom we all lost when ""progress"" intervened."
2,Vastly over-rated,"5 stars? No way. Granted, I read this book many years ago but a few things stick in my mind. 1) It seemed to be about people who were really worried about their social standing in the tribe (where's the ""spirituality"" in that?) 2) Three quarters of the way through the book, I felt like I was slogging through thigh deep water, hard going. 3) And when I got to the end what did I get? Some pseudo-mystical death glorification.If you want to read some books about native Americans, I suggest you start with ""Lame Deer, Seeker of Visions"" by Richard Erdoes and""Panther in the Sky"" by James Alexander Thom."
2,"A ""pretty"" book, but doubt all you read....","Yes, Hanta Yo! is a very romantic work of fiction. Yes, Ms. Hill includes a few ""Lakota"" words in the ""dictionary"" in the back, but ask a Lakota what he / she thinks about it. TODAY'S Indians are NOT like the ones portrayed in this book. There is also great doubt that a ""wasichu"" , and a woman at that, was given such careful consideration by any ""holy men"" or Elders. It may have happened , but maybe not. Like Dances With Wolves, it is simply a romantic fiction, well written, moving, but not representative of modern Indians who do not , for the most part, see it as a great work , and certainly NOT as a ""Bible"" of any sort. Recommended for reading about today's Indians, "" Indians are Us?"" about the cultural theft of a proud and very alive people."
4,Albion Ridge and the Redwoods of Northern California,"I love reading the New Settler newspaper from Northern California. These are the stories of the pioneers and activists of Humboldt and Mendocino counties. The backwoods of the Pacific rainforest. Their stories are like the new Foxfire books.--Alex Sydorenko, Chicago, 2001"
1,Reading with phonics (Leapster),"I bought what I thought was an interactive BOOK as it was described. I received a small cartridge looking thing but NO BOOK. As I live in Europe and have done so for the last ten years and only recently adopted a 4 year old boy, I had no idea that what I was buying would require another piece of machinary or equipment. As I had it shipped to my brother's house in the states and then only received it a couple of months later when my mom came for a visit, it was too late to return it. So it is completely unusable and was a waste of my money. I feel that the information provided on the internet should clearly indicate that in order to read this virtual ""book"" one requires a another piece of equipment."
4,Ms. Yvonne is BAD,Ms. Yvonne is not good 4 children! Here's why:(1)Way 2 much cleavage(2)Falls in love w/ every guy she meets!
3,Decent Portable Scanner for Mac,"I got this scanner for scanning documents and receipts on the road with my MacBook. Scanner works ok with the downloaded driver but only pretty basic functionality is provided on the Mac side.If you really need a portable scanner for you Mac and don't need to do anything fancy or of high quality with it, this one works.Just hope you don't need any support from Pentax - and if you do, don't hold your breath waiting on them to get back to you - very disappointing."
4,Good TV for the money,"Not too shabby for a $100 TV. The picture is a little fuzzy, but it has alot more features than the ancient 13"" I had previously."
4,No problems with mine,"I bought this set at Fred Meyer's about 4 years ago. The picture still looks great. It has always worked perfectly. Unlike one of the other reviewers, mine has no noises at all, just the proper sounds from the speakers. I guess some people have gotten defective units. One person said that there are no picture adjustments, but this is not true. The menu has all the usual adjustments: color, contrast, sharpness, brightness, and tint, plus game mode. You just go to ""picture"" in the menu and scroll through the options with the up and down buttons. The only complaints I have with it are that it doesn't have speaker output jacks and it isn't digital ready, though I use cable anyway."
2,Not for the long run...,"You get what how much you paid for I guess. I only paid 100 bucks, but still... I bought this TV set 2 years ago and now it just won't work. Its not damaged, it didn't fall on anything. I didn't spill any liquids on it. I tried to keep dust off. But for some reason it won't turn on.Plus, the tv set is really a basic one with no real controls over the contrast, brightness, etc. It has it's own idea of what you'll like and if it's not giving the option, than forget about it.What really makes me angry is that I have one tv set that I had for over 6 years and it still works fine.Before you think of buy this product, ask yourself. Am I planning to buy another TV set in 1 to 2 years, because your going to."
5,From the sublime to the merely good.,"This collection is an absolute steal. Three of the concerto recordings are unsurpassed. The Haskil Chopin is legendary, Richter's Liszt is colossal and Janis's Rachmaninoff is absolutely formidable. Brendel's recordings of Mozart and Beethoven are on a lesser level of achievement, but never less than good.It should be noted that the Liszt and Rachmaninoff are Mercury Living Presence recordings, and if you've never heard a recording with only 3 well-placed mics, they do sound different from the usual 25-plus microphone recordings we are usually blessed (cursed) with.At this price, one of the absolute CD bargains of all time."
4,Meh...,"This collection serves as a descent introduction to some great piano concertos, but the performances are not the best and the recording quality of most of them leaves much to be desired for me. I learned my lesson with regards to the 'best of' classical collections. Personally I'd rather have gotten great recordings of great performances of great classical pieces for a little more money."
3,Not for Novices,"An encyclopedia of helpful information but, this will not be helpful to a novice trying to learn the program for the first time.For that get Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 Visual Quickstart Guide (Negrino and Smith)."
1,Don't buy from this seller,I ordered this book over a month ago and it was never shipped. I emailed the seller and they never responded. DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER.
3,big ol' book for dreamweaver,"i think this book and a handful of video tutorials can really help a person design a website. with only the book for help, one might get lost. i used this book along with youtube video walkthroughs to make my own website. however i think flash is probably a better program to know these days for web development. you can certainly end up with some sort of webpage with this though."
5,Image quality,"The image quality is, compared to iTunes regular (non HD) or Amazon instant video, extremely bad. BBC should not sell dvds with poor quality like this."
5,Worth waiting for!,"Worth the wait...Just finished watching season 9....it was great~ Once again, I'm online looking to see the ""buzz"" on season 10...rumor has it there will be one with sadly only 6 episodes! This show is better than 24 ever was, hands down! I have even heard that there are talks about making an American version of MI-5...I HOPE NOT!"
5,BBC Best,"Living in the USA, we don't often get the honor of seeing great British television. Being a HUGE Richard Armitage fan, this series was a must have for my collection."
3,gift,I bought this at a request for a gift and they said they liked it but no other feedback received
4,I was stunned,"I've watched all of the seasons and have to say that I was fairly stunned at the twists and turns this season took, especially in the last two episodes. I didn't know where they were going with the Lucas North story and was figuring that in the end the character was some how going to make everything right, that is up until the time he essentially murdered the CIA crytographer he was suppose to protect. After that I was totally off balance. The ending was unexpected and has me chomping at the bit for the next season. If Harry survives all of this, who will be the next section chief? In the end, very well done."
5,Intense!,British TV show is fast paced and very heavy duty. This season features Sophia Myles-one of the best actresses working today. Never a dull moment!
3,"some mistakes, and missing historical info, but practical","Santos is a great city to visit. Easily reachable by bus from Sao Paulo down 1000 meters through the hairpin turns of the Mata Atlantica to the coastline. The biggest port in Lat. Am. with a fascinating history. Brasil was founded in nearby Sao Vincente. The towns are poor, as much of Brasil is, but they are making great improvements. The Coffee Exhange building is great ! Nice botantical gardens, the aquarium has fish that have legs ! Unfortunately your recommended hotel - The Hotel Gonzaga is burnt out, a bus stop, and housing for homeless. Try the Hotel Atlantico instead. There is no great guide for all Brasil yet, but this one has the most practical info."
1,Amateur filming,I was not really impressed with this DVD. I thought it was going to be more of a professional movie and it was pretty much a lot of home videos strung together and some narraration going on for part of it. Some of the tornado footage was pretty thrilling but I got motion sickness from the camera moving too much. If you are a real tornado buff you might enjoy it but if not I would give it a pass.
3,Basic Introduction,This is a basic introduction to tornadoes. There is good footage of storms from the early and mid-nineties. It contains shots I have not seen elsewhere.
1,The WORST tornado DVD ever!,"This DVD is without a doubt the WORST tornado DVD I have ever seen! I have a collection of over 20 tornado themed DVD's and this one is ROCK BOTTOM. There is a washed up, old weatherman from Tulsa that narrarates the majority of the DVD and gives tired, elementary school tips on how tornadoes form and how to survive them. I'm surprised he didn't recommend the ""southeast corner of the basement"" tip! The tornado footage is so ANCIENT it's laughable. Do not waste your hard earned cash on this junk!"
1,Bad on all grounds,"No use trying to tell the violent story with very phony torture by gang members.Bad lighting, shot mostly in dark, bad sound, bad acting and unsure ending."
5,This is amazing!,"I know for a fact this product works.When my grandmother died at 93 years old, she barely had a wrinkle.She used this religiously for years. However, you could tell she never applied this to her neck, THAT was wrinkled. hehe"
5,A Must Have Pocket Reference!,"Kudos to Dr. Bull for compiling one of the most comprehensive reference guides dedicated to the injuries of the athlete! Found within the covers is a comprehensive list of conditions and injuries starting with systemic injuries then ranging to sport specific issues. It is well done as it addresses issues from a mechanism of injury perspective, an anatomical perspective, pathophsyiology considerations, an examination perspective and a treatment perspective! A must have for any sports medicine professional!Steven G. Lesh, PhD, PT, SCS, ATC"
5,This is a MUST READ!,"Scott Stanley has paved the way for married couples to really understand what commitment in marriage is all about. He has taken the best from research and with his practical down-to-earth writing style inspires and motivates couples to reaffirm and deepen their heart commitment to each other. If more couples read this book and followed Dr. Stanley's excellent advice, divorce attorneys would be looking for another job. It is by far the best thing I have read on the subject of commitment!"
4,A surprisingly good book for such a low price,"There seem to be more and more quality books coming to the market as of late. I recently received a complimetary copy of this book and was pleasantly surprised by its' accuracy, layout, and compact format. Mr. Mattson deserves credit for including very accurate programs and realistic fixturing and manufacturing processes.This book is the best value for the CNC student's money today."
3,A basic book,"This book is a good beginners volume, focusing on G code programming and operations. However, it is not really on a college level as to the information delivery and the presentation. Would be terrific for High School or a some short course. But for a college course, it seems to fall a little short."
5,Another great figure from Ary Asylum,"This Borg Assimilation figure blew me away. The level of detail and the scuplt on this figure was amazing. It is a durable figure and for the price that Amazon is offering, you can't beat it. Your kid will love this figure."
2,Includes some stuff not good for little kids,"I was looking for a children's Bible with beautiful pictures for very young ones. This book DID have beautiful images and I loved the descriptive words in the writing that would be fun to read to children and paints vivid images in the mind. However, on page 26 the Bible started including things not appropriate for really small ones. The dream of the baker whose bread was devoured by birds was a foreshadow of his execution. The dream of Pharaoh that predicted 7 years of famine with dying cattle. Dead cows lying in piles and boils all over one's skin in the plagues. The story of Samson... where Delilah was just his ""friend."" I just quit reading the book by that point. Not a good choice of stories for little kids. I will be buying something else."
3,kind of flimsy for a small child,"the pages started coming out just days after we gave it to my daughter. taped them back in, so it works -- but still. She loves the pictures and the bottoms and tops of the pages have little pictures of animals on some pages which is just perfect for capturing a small child's interest. Other than the flimsy issue, we're pleased with this first Bible and are happpy we bought it."
5,use it often,"i like that I can choose the workouts, so can choose a short workout for a late start morning, or do the entire routine on a lazy weekend day. nice job all around. I prefer to go to a yoga class, but when I can't, this does the job."
2,Too #@%$@ Fast,There's no value for me in a yoga program that holds poses for just a few seconds. It takes as much as two minutes for the tissues to get permanently increased mobility and this program just doesn't do that. Who needs speed yoga?
3,pretty average,Pretty average for my taste. My daily Ashtanga practice gives me far more than this DVD.
3,Not for a novice,"I guess I assumed this DVD would move a little slower since it's for ""athletes"" not ""yoga experts."" I have taken yoga classes for several years but could not begin to keep up with this flow type yoga. I know many people who love this DVD but it just wasn't for me."
5,I like it.,"This is my first yoga DVD. Pretty straight forward. I like the 3 preset workouts, plus you can customize to your liking. Easy to follow after the first couple of time. It might be easier if you already know how to do yoga. I did not."
1,Hated it! Was misleading and described as a video but was actually a music CD.,"Title: Best of Bellydance from Egypt, Lebanon, Arabria & TurkeyHated it! Is described as a belly dancing video but is actually a music CD. Will never order from this vendor again."
4,Interesting read,"Thank you Antwone for your honest writing detailing your life. I found your book well-written and inspiring! I work with children and know that some of them need more support from their loving, school-family."
5,Great story,"This was a mesmerizing story and so sad that a child could get so lost in the system. Really amazing that he could come through this and make something of himself despite the hardship of his early years. The foster family makes you really really mad but despite this he does not let their abuse of him ruin his life completely. Very inspirational, very believable. So sad, makes you really aware of how the system can lose a child even when people think they are doing what is best."
5,Just finished reading this book...,"I don't want to tell the story, and ruin the purpose of this book. This was an AWESOME book. If you saw the movie, you'll like the book better. The book expresses more feeling and detail. The book made me cry, especially Antwone's first real christmas gift. It's a tear-jerker. The sad part is, all of it is true."
5,Outstanding,"I have read this book a few times due to the powerful nature of both the topic and the writing. I am compelled to write a second review beacuse it is such a moving and important book. I have not yet met Mr. Fisher, however I did appear on a National Public Radio talk show with him a few years ago and can attest to his spirit and courage.I strongly recommend that all of you read this vastly important book and consider Mr. Fisher's experiences, his feelings, and all of the implications in the book for how we might shape foster care policy, practice and how we allocate resources on behalf of those in the foster care system."
5,Excellent book,"This was a rather random purchase but I am glad I got it. It was extremely moving. THe description of his family was a bit confusing the first few pages, but after that, it flowed quite well. Much, much better than the movie Antwone Fisher."
3,Okay,I can appreciate the events in the life of the author but I would not recommend this book to my teenage grandchildren because of some parts in it which seemed a little graphic.
5,I loved it,"After reading other memoirs, I was struck by how exceptional the writing is in Finding Fish! Really top-notch. What a talented man and talented writer! And what a compelling story! I haven't seen the movie, but I'm going to look for it now. Congratulations to Antwone Fisher for coming out of such a horrible situation, and even thriving. And thank you for sharing your story."
5,Well Told Memoir,So many other 5 stars have been written for this book that I don't have much else to say. I ditto every good thing that was said.
4,finding fish: an emotional journey,For those who have read the book it is a good read. There are some parts that will piss you off. The book is excellent for people who just like a good read or redaing in general.
2,A Thoroughly Exhausting Read,"After seeing Antwone Fisher in the theatre, reading the novel just does not seem to do the movie justice. The novel moves at an extremely slow pace and I just couldn't move pass the halfway point. It starts out good but then it gets extremely boring added to the fact that you just can't read but so much at a time of it. I definitely will recommend the movie over the novel. Get this book from the library because you probably will not finish it."
3,Some parts boring,"This book did show that even though someone can have a bad upbringing you can still overcome it. Most of the book I enjoyed, but a few parts were boring for me."
3,Familiar Story Well Told,"The glowing words of [...] readers are not unlike those of my book club. While I agree the story is heartbreaking and very well told, I struggle to find something that makes this story unique. In other words, why this story? Maybe I've lived in NYC too long, but Fisher's experiences were not unlike those of thousands of kids in America today. The Horation Alger aspect of Fisher's experience ties the whole thing up in a neat little package that I find disturbing and not at all the norm. Would I recommend this book? Indeed. The writing is good and, by all accounts, the editing is superb. The only difference between Fisher's account and the stories printed in daily papers across America is that his story is all in one place."
1,Finding a Great Book,"I saw the film, Antwone Fisher, in the theater and watched it recently on Cinemax. Then I read the book. This is not only a poignant story, but it's beautifully, passionately written.I'm white; I was never in foster care; I've never been homeless or experienced those horrendous problems, but I understood. I felt Fisher's pain and triumph. Thanks for an emotional, powerful reading experience."
4,Emotional,A great true story of triumph. Antwone overcame so much and is an inspiration. Everyone should read this. This is just one story o child abuse. This book is raising awareness for foster kids everywhere.
4,AN INSPIRING CHRONICLE OF SELF-DISCOVERY,"Before reading the novel, many people saw the movie that was inspired by the life story of Antwone Fisher. Both are fascinating character studies that chronicle the hard life of a disadvantaged young man who lived to tell the tale.I am always amazed by the number of children who become ""throwaways"" after being tossed into a flawed foster care system. Antwone's story, however, shows that childhood adversities CAN be overcome through hard work, diligence, and a desire to succeed. Achieving an appreciation for his own dignity and worth, however, was the goal that dominated Antwone's search for self-discovery and, ultimately, allowed him to thrive, while his less confident peers were swallowed whole by an uncaring system. More than our sympathy, Antwone deserves our congratulations for conquering such a formidable adversary."
4,A great book,"I like this book so much: we used it for an art history course at Yale on art, architecture, and design from 1890-1940. Pevsner's goal, seemingly quite simple but really so complex, is to show the SOURCES of modernism, its origins. This is what the title suggests. Yet it seems he does so much more - he teaches, he gives things dignity, he makes clear intricate connections reaching across space, time, and place in architecture and the applied arts. Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau, industrialism, the International Style - everything. Plus the illustrations are fitting and so beautiful. Pevsner gives mention to things often neglected - jewelry, ceramics, etc. It's a compact work, slim, beautiful, easy to read, and great to have as a reference."
4,Great material,"This product keeps your face and ears surprisingly warm in moderately cold temperatures, despite the thinness of the material. The mask was problematic for me because I have a small nose and wear a top-bun of my hair so the mask would occasionally slip up into my eyes. Unlike a previous review, I do not believe that the mask prevented me from having a runny nose. I like the color, the feel, and ease of cleaning the mask."
4,What I wanted,"I ordered the Traditional Balaclava to wear as supplemental heat in my sleeping bag. It works fine. I need a slightly different product that covers my cheeks, but this is fine. It's smooth, does not pull my hair and cause Pseudofolliculitis like wool caps."
5,Really comfortable...,Fast shipping and the product was exactly as the picture looked. The mask is made of lightweight material that is thick and stretchy making it more durable and comfortable than those cheap itchy ski mask. It keeps my face nice and warm.
4,Great,Great Balaclava!It is a nice and stretchy material and thin so it can go under your helmet easily.I only wish is was a little thicker to provide more warmth as I ride with an open face helmet in 10-30 degrees F. But overall it rocks.
4,Great for Winter Riding ( Motorcycle ),The only issue is that I wish the neck was a little longer. I really dont have a long neck but sometimes it rides up exposing you adams apple to the wind.
3,it's OK,"If used as a first layer, it's very good. I dinged it a couple stars because the weather I used it in was at a football game in the low 40s. The breeze was very slight and I wore a cap over it and I felt a tinge of cool. The other ding is that my ears hurt from being bent I guess. Odd I didn't realize they were bent. My neck was nice and toasty and that was huge. I'll try it again next year but I'll wear a stocking cap over it."
4,rate a balaclave purchased via Amazon,Received this product and wore it during a spell of cold weather. It performed as I might have hoped.
1,This is NOT a Benchmade Ares ...,"Ignore 100% of the description of this knife, it is completely incorrect. The seller ships a Benchmade 740 Dejavoo (plain edge, satin finish) when you order this particular knife, not a Benchmade 730 series Ares knife as is described on the screen. They then blame Amazon for the issue. The knives are not similar at all, so I have to assume they know very little about knives. This knife was on my saved list or in my cart for months, it could have been corrected if they would just take the effort... They did offer to reimburse via Paypal if I ship the knife back, but since I don't use Paypal that doesn't sound very appealing. And given their recent 1/5 star feedbacks recently I'd rather hang onto the $100 wrong knife and at least have something for my money than risk losing both and having to post a 1/5 star feedback myself."
1,Smells horrid!,"I got the lotion and the perfume as a gift, they don't even smell alike!!! The lotion smells like a strong smelling perfume that has the scent of flowers and burnt rubber."
4,interesting book,"This is a good book, a little gross for some of the girls. he kind of falls apart at the end, but it is great if you like monsters"
3,Cute,"This is a cute story with lots of rhyming. My 5 month old loves the bright illustrations, and will like interacting with the story when he's older."
3,Poorly Formatted for Kindle,"Wonderful book, but the Kindle format is terrible. To read it, you have to keep turning from vertical view to horizontal view. Also, the images are so tiny you have to keep double-tapping the images, then closing them out.Buy it in hardcover. Kindle is a cumbersome waste of money.My heart goes out to the author. Your work deserves better."
5,One of our favorites!,"My son has LOVED this book since he was about 9 months old. At 18 months he now acts out the audience responses to all of Frank's activity ""Boffo"", ""Yuck"", ""Uh-Oh"". Yes, it is a little gross and it's hard to explain why he knows the word eyeball, but the bright pictures and fabulous rhymes mean that I can enjoy reading it over and over and over. Highly recommend it."
5,It has my kids cracking up,What's not to love about a monster who wants to dance?!?! It's a silly book that my kids cracking up.
2,Talent?,"The music is allright and the guy can sing okay. The girl has no talent. She sings through her nose. Everytime she hits a high note a hideous sound comes out. Anyone who has been in choir, or taken voice lessons will know what I am talking about. She sticks out like a sore thumb."
4,Catchy!,"I love this album. Most of the songs are very catchy. I like how they did a song just with Monchy and one just featuring Alexandra (not saying I liked them, but it's a great twist for a duo!)"
2,cheap,"it's small, cheap. cons - this fixture need a special bulbs, which hard to find/ and these bulbs are not cheap"
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!,"I bought this for my son for Christmas, and when I first opened the box I thought they sent me the wrong thing. It was a bag of string!! You have to thread this thing together yourself...it takes hours. I could have gone to a fabric store and bought the string for less. It looks nothing like the picture, even when your done!! I would have sent it back, but unfortunately it got opened before I could. If I could have given it a 0(instead of a 1) I would have. DON'T WASTE YOU MONEY!"
4,Evans Blue,I bought this CD only knowing one of the tracks. This CD was better than i anticipated. There is alot of good tracks on it. If you are wondering if you should buy it or not i would. If you like good new age rock you will like this CD.
3,Great Product For The Radio,"If you like listening to modern alternative radio this a good band. They have borrowed enough from different artists to appeal to a variety of listeners. I was turned off a little by hearing a little too much Tool influence. I like Tool but, it would be nice if someone could create their own sound but I suppose this band (like many others) is trying to utilize a popular formula for success. Anyway, some people will really like this Band."
4,"original band,with original sound","I picked up this cd because some reviews compare this band to Tool. So I was surprised at first, but then i realized that this band is not like tool they are totally different style of music.Evans blue is more like Chevelle and Cold.Buy this cd if you are into alternative metal.85/100best song cold,possesion,the tease"
4,good!,"This is an exceptional first album. Many bands these days are confined to one sound and sort of 'industry standard' production. Evans Blue does not break out too far beyond current standards in terms of original sound, but there is definitely something for everyone on this album. I liked it so much I also bought the cd for a friend's birthday!"
5,Evans is anything but Blue,"My first song was the Cold one, then I got the cd and I really got into several. My fav? Quote. Alternative in style. I think if you get it and are open to new things, this could be the one your playing in the car or on your Ipod you got for Christmas!!"
2,AND YET ANOTHER BAND...,THAT SOUNDS LIKE TOOL/APC...ONLY UNMEMORAble AND THIS GUY TRIES MORE TO SOUND LIKE THE GUY FROM EARSHOT. TRY AGAIN GUYS.
3,They want to be A Perfect Circle...,"...and that is not neccessarily a bad thing. This album is decent. There really is no diversity and mainly every song sounds pretty similar. They are definately striving for the whole-Maynard-APC thing here. They just are not as good. I would even say that a similar band-10 Years- is better. I guess I think Evans Blue is ok, but its just that they lack any sense of groundbreaking musically. The best songs are the first three and Possesion, the Sarah McLachlan cover. Besides that, the songs are all ok but nothing to write home about. There are better things to buy than this."
4,Better than average CD and rock band,"I really liked the song Cold (But I'm Still Here) and I read some other reviews on here and everyone said how great it was, so I got the CD. It is very good. It is a little different style of rock than I usually listen to, it almost at times sounds like the kind of whiny rock that I dispise (fall out boy, simple plan, all american rejects, etc.) If I had to relate the sound of this band to another I would say that Depswa probably sounds the most like Evans Blue. There are a few songs that just do anything for me, but there are a lot more that I really like. So this is one of the better CDs that I have bought somewhat recently, but not the best. Still above average."
4,legit,"ok this cd didn't blow me away, it was good, i listened to the clips and wanted to buy it. and i understand a little where the perfect cirle stuff came from, but please 10 years is nothing like either band they have background from bands like sevendust creed doubledrive and skrape (all should be checked out by the way) and none are close to perfect circle. you listen to 10 years and anyone can tell that, so yea evans blue is a good sound, original is almost impossible to find today in any genre so if you don't buy a cd cause it might sound like someone else then you really have a small collection, this one should be in most collections"
5,Just picked it up today,"I kept hearing this song on the radio (cold) and I wasn't sure who it was, so i kept listening and listening to figure it out and they finally said the name of the band was evans blue. I just went out and bought it today, and I truley like every song on the albulm, you have to check it out!"
1,Disappointing,This ball is very disappointing. It is not the color shown but rather a dull mustard yellow. The main reason I purchased this ball is because my daughter loves orange. It arrived with fingerprint smudges all over the ball. I would return it if the shipping was not half the cost of the ball.
2,OK Brush,"This was my first time buying a facial brush. There wasn't anything too fancy about this one. I didn't care so much for the texture of the brush. I have pretty sensitive skin and so it was a little on the rough side for me. It was a nice sized brush and the fan style was fine, but again, the material of the brush was too harsh. I don't think I would recommend this to a friend. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Wrong Problem,"Is there anything more futile then the synoptic problem? A professor of New Testament at a Theological Seminary should certainly realize that the problem is not a literary one. Let me explain. The synoptic problem, as defined by the book, is why luke, mark, and matthew look so much alike. Many possible solutions exist but none have been proven. My concern is what will be gained if this problem is solved? Maybe we could better ascertain the theological preferences of the evangelists but then we will have a bigger problem harmonizing those idiosyncracies then we do now. Beyond that, there is no advantage. For what it is the book does introduce and explain the theories and such, but don't devote your life too it. Too many great minds do alrighty."
2,Middle Level ISEE,"I would not recommend this book for kids preparing for the middle level ISEE exam. The practice exercises for all levels of this exam are intermingled, so it is not clear to the student which exercises are likely to appear on their particular test. It would be overwhelming for a younger student to use this book without a great deal of parent direction."
4,"review of Cracking the SSAT/ ISEE, 2001 Edition","This test preparation book is very useful for students preparing to take the SSAT and ISEE tests. Especially well-explained are the scoring norms and conversions of Scaled Scores to Percentiles. Problematic is the titling of the scoring tables chapter. It might be better to re-title the chapter, ""Your scores and where you rank"". There is ample practice, explanation and examples of the distinct question types in all areas. The two full sample tests constitute sufficient practice for the purposes of this test. Consideration should be given for future editions to separate the ISEE from SSAT preparation sections into distinct texts."
1,Riddled with errors,I found this book to be very disappointing. It had too many errors in the practice exams and answer keys to be helpful or reliable.
5,A nutrient from plants,"Standard Process is a nutrient made from plants and free of chemicals. When we are trying to escape free radicals, why put a chemical vitamin into your body? I rely on this company!"
3,Helps increase energy,My Chiropractor recommended this to me. It helps to increase your energy throughout the day. I take 2 in the morning and 2 at night. Does not keep you up.
4,New to LDAP? Check this book out.,"This Solaris Blueprint will be of interest to anyone wishing to evaluate LDAP for use in their enterprise. The book focuses upon implementing the iPlanet Directory Services which come bundled with Solaris 8. If your main desire is to setup a working LDAP server using this software, this book is for you. Helpful chapters include setting up a secure server, integrating the Solaris native LDAP client with the iPlanet server, and some recommendations for server sizing and tuning. I was somewhat disappointed that the book did not go into greater depth about key issues, such as integrating with other LDAP-enabled products. Most of us have to deal with NT authentication, Exchange servers, and other heterogenous environments. This book only gives a single-product plug when discussing synchronization issues. If you're looking for non-product specific information, you'll need to keep looking elsewhere."
2,99 feet ?,"I love the looks of this watch,Simple, yet dressy.(Purchased 8/3/12 for $74). What I didn't like was that twice now it has fogged up under the glass.It says water resistant to 99 feet. I live in Florida @ 6 ft ABOVE sea level, and its getting fogged up ??? without even getting under any water? Not even a shower. Hello ? Yes its Humid,But Really? I have to take another watch to a shop , so I'll have them check to see if its something simple like a crimped seal. If not I'll return. ?Seiko Men's SGFA09 Dress Two-Tone Watch"
2,Dissapointed,"I purchased that watch primaily because it was advertised with a luminated dial. There have been rare occasions when I saw somewhat of an illumination, but 95 percent of the time there is none. Perhaps it is just MY watch where the illumination does not work correctly. This is a shame, as otherwise it is a good-looking watch. But then, ""You get what you pay for!"""
4,a beautifull watch,beautifull and cheap product ... everybody like this watch on my hand when i go out with my friends!
1,not worth the money,The watch would keep time ok. The problem is the date and the the day of the month would never stay after being corrected.
1,Don't buy from Nail Discount,"Rating the transaction, not the item.Bought for a friend but the booties did not get very warm, only slightly warm. Now sitting on shelf in the closet, never used because of Nail Discount's poor customer service. It was an e-mail nightmare with them, all for a $30 item so not worth returning because of shipping fees, restocking fees, etc.I'll never buy another item from them.Are the booties defective or do they just not get very warm? Don't know so tough to rate the item.Amazon now offers a lower price and the item qualifies for Free Shipping so now actually cheaper & easier to just re-purchase the item!After hundreds of purchases from Amazon, this is the only bad one. Customer service through Amazon has always been great for me. I'm more cautious now when I see the item is through an Affiliate"
4,Excellent Bargain Reed,"This cd really is a great buy for the price. You get 16 tracks many of them his biggest hits and the sound quality is very good. I tend to seek out blues albums on their original labels such as Veejay or Chess and am normally suspect of the sound quality on others, but Charly has done a fine job with this compilation. I own several other Reed titles that I've paid more for and this one would be my favorite if it just had ""High and Lonesome"" on it. This is the only reason I don't give it five stars but don't let that discourage you. There is one error on the track listings: ""Down in Virginia"" looks to be on the disc twice but the second listing is actually ""You Don't Have To Go""."

4,Great product,"Fairly easy to install. We ordered 3 for each receptionist in our office and between the three of us, we figured it out and were all set up in about an hour. The headset is a little hard to connect to the charger, but not to the point that I wouldn't recommend it. We use the headband to wear ours, I don't see how anyone could use the ear attachment. It is very bulky and to me, you'd have to have a huge ear to hold it on. I wish it had the newer kind that went behind your head, but this works just fine. Overall, it was easy to setup and works great. No problems so far."
4,Elementary statistics,"Elementary statistical procedures is in good condition and at an attractive price. The book arrived well within the specified time, well packed. As expected excellent service from Amazon. Technically the subject is covered at a basic level suitable for students with little previous formal knowledge."
2,It works...just VERY SLOWLY,"I've had the Lexar 1GB Firefly for a few months now and have decided to use it as a back-up storage device only; I do not use this device for transporting documents/data that I'll need to transfer or update regularly, because it is very, very slow. Currently, all of my saved documents/files take up about 50MB of storage space. It takes roughly 20 minutes to transfer all of this data onto the Firefly. So, for regular usage, quick transfers and portability, I use another flash device.For $9, I am satisfied with this device as a means of storing my documents and files. However, if you will need a flash drive for regular/frequent use, I'd suggest you consider other options."
2,worked well for 18 months,I used FirefoxPortable on this and found the speed adequate. It just stopped working after about 18 months.
3,"Does the job, but does it slowly.","I purchased the Lexar Firefly 1GB from the student bookstore at my University for only $14.00. I use it often and it works perfectly for all of my papers and text documents. Anything larger takes some time to load and interact with though.I was disappointed by the speed issue as I hoped to use the flash drive with portlable firefox and other small, usb drive based application. The device is far to slow to do this though.Since it is really only good for storage of small files I would suggest buying one of the fireflies with smaller capacity. If all you are doing is storing text files the smaller drives should do and are a better value."
1,"People, get a life","Please. These things SUCK. Oh, wow! Its got a 3 inch screen!! Big deal! My portable DVD player is 10.2 inches; almost tripple the size of this! The quality is pixely and crap, and you have to buy the stupid ""Video Now"" Pvds. $14 for, what? 6 episodes? Oh, thats so cool, as in not really. Trust me people. Stick to portably DVD player. Yes, they are very expensive, but they will last twice as long. If you want a really good DVD player, buy the 10.2 inch Insigna Portable DVD. Yeah, its $260, but it is worth every penny. So, all in, if you are gulliable, and like blowing your money on a device that is better left in the store, buy this! But, if you are like me, stick to DVD players."
3,"Great concept, lousy PVDs other than for preschoolers","I purchased the VideoNow JR for my 2 year old this past fall and decided to pick up 2 VideoNow players for my 4 and 6 year olds when they went on sale this Christmas. While Fisher Price has great PVDs for the preschool front with many educational characters (Blues Clues, Sesame Street, Dora), I have been sadly disappointed with the selection for my older children. I would evaluate the PVDs available before purchasing the product and intend to return the one unopened one which we have."
3,broke after 2 uses,"good thing I kept the original box... after only 2 uses, when I tried to lift up the screen I heard a click & a small part came flying off (I didn't drop it or mishandled it).. one of the parts that holds the screen is cracked & prevents it from opening the screen... I was able to exchanged it at TRU w/ no problem.."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this last year for my son for Christmas. I didn't buy the PVD's until some time later, because all of the age appropriate titles or the ones he would like were sold out everywhere. (He is now 7)Anyway, by the time I finally got him some PVD's, the system, although it had been unopened until that time, did not work. Occasionally I would hear sound, but I never saw a picture. I was very disappointed and since I had purchased it quite a while before we used it, I didn't bother trying to return it. I gave in and bought a Video Now FX player today, so I am hoping that we have better results with this one."
1,Parent,"The video now was purchased at local Toys R Us. It did not function after the screen to select ""A"" or ""B"" appeared. It appears to freeze up. Batteries are not easy to change; a screwdriver is needed each time."
1,CRAP!,This toy is a peice of crap! I hate it! The picture is very bad! It is very expensive $80.00!!!!!!! I just bought it yesterday and I'm having trouble with it already!!!!! Sometimes it works and sometimes there is sound but a blank screen!!!!! Don't buy!
1,Horrible... Tiger Electronics's worst ever.,"Who cares what the commercail says. It is not an Widescreen. Man, a 3 inch screen? Great, my PSP screen is bigger than your's Tiger Electron-poop. The discs are only 30 minutes long? The discs for the PSP is an half gigabite. DO NOT BUY THIS WASTE!"
4,Worth it...for Windows...,"I've had this little device for close to four years, and it has finally conked out - it simply no longer comes on.I did like the range of it, and ease of use.The problems were:1. The laser pointer only generated a tiny spotlight which sometimes was not sufficient if used with a bright projector screen.2. The USB receiver was so designed that it could be inserted the wrong way when placing it back into the hand-held device. This happened quite frequently when I lent it out to others who need to use it. The newer versions seemed to have addressed this.All in all, it did work rather well. I think it is rather pricey, given that you can't use it to move the cursor on the screen. A powerful tool and a good investment considering that appearances are necessary to upkeep."
3,Better Try Keyspan PR-US2 Presentation Remote,"It is usesfull the time indicator, but the Keyspan PR-US2 Presentation Remote controlles the mouse"
2,Clicker for PP by MS,Works as it should for price which is on high side there are cheaper units that still get the job done.
1,not worth anything,Amazon is the worth company to buy from. you send me wrong item and i 'm very unhappy. I do not recommend any one to order stuf from amazone
4,Great Presenter,"I needed a cordless remote for an oral defense of a Master's thesis. Though the Logitech is more expensive than most, the timer feature was the selling point. If you have timed presentations than this one is for you. The remote counts down after you set your desired time and vibrates at 5-minutes-left and 2-minutes-left. If you do not need this feature, it may be worth going with a cheaper version???However, I found that the remote worked seemlessly and quickly updated when I used it on new computers for the first time. I felt the laser pointer on mine was not as sharp as I had seen on a couple of my colleage's (seems to have a slight separation in the beam so the ""point"" is not as sharp, but it works just as well).I highly recommend this product for those avid presenters."
5,Beyond Expectations,In use in our large Worship and Life center in our church. The sensor is behind a glass window and the remote still works at any angle from almost 100ft away!
4,Cordless presenter,I have really enjoyed using my new cordless presenter in my college classes. Good purchase.
5,"Does exactly what it says it does, and that is OK","I bought this to drive a PowerPoint presentation in a large lecture hall. I wanted features to advance, reverse, and blank the screen. This does that. The laser pointer is dandy for entertaining the cats, but I have not figured a need for it in class. Nor do I need the timer. Still, they are both nice features and work easily.I am running this with another radio device in a USB port, and was worried about frequncy troubles. All worked fine.I walk the room a great deal during class, and, at least so far, I have not found any range problem (and it is a big room).I love the size of this thing (small is good) and the buttons are impossible to be confused by (and working by touch takes 10 seconds to get used to).The only down side is, well, probably having to pay for it. Seriously, if you want a basic presenter, this one works just fine. There are other presenters that have more features. Just make sure what you want is on the device you get."
2,Already two failed,"I had two of them, one replaced by another due to failure of laser button. Both of them failed exactly after 1 and half semester of usage for teaching. The laser button doesn't work anymore. Very bad reliability. If you are looking to buy something for everyday classroom teaching, I don't recommend this product. But, I really liked the 5 min vibration and LCD to check the time."
5,Awesome for use in the classroom!,"I bought this product to do presentations in churches regarding missions. I am also now using the device in my classroom (middle school). Using this device with my laptop and projector is awesome. Also, the range is a lot more than 50ft. I have used it over 100 ft with no problem. The pointer is also a great feature.I would recommend this product to anyone who does presentations."
4,Great presenter - easy to setup,"This is a great presenter and sets up on its own without software. Like other presenters, though, I keep accidentally hitting the next slide instead of hitting the laser button and I could not get the F5/esc or CRT/Projector button to work. I probably have to do a little more manual review for that. Otherwise, it was better than my previous presenter in that the USB receiver plugs back into the presenter so it can't get lost. I agree with previous reviewers that the 5 min at a time timer could be improved upon."
4,Solid Presentation Tool,"I purchased this piece to for my company to use for a series of high-level meetings. The cordless presenter worked flawlessly including no issue with plug-n-play. It feels sturdy, survived some tumbles off the podium, and battery life has not been an issue. I highly recommend this piece."
4,Logitec Cordless Presenter 2.4,<Logitech 2.4 GHz Cordless Presenter>Great product. Neat and effective. You should try it!
5,Excellent Product!,"The Logitech 2.4 GHz cordless presenter is a highly functional tool that makes presentations easy. It is small enough to be easily portable, yet is powerful enough to accomplish the tasks any presenter should need. It moves through slides easily. The ability to black out the screen while you present is a useful feature. The numerous other functions make this a well-designed tool. This is a highly functional asset that gives you great value for the money. I would highly recommend this to anyone who was looking for a presentation tool!"
4,Cordless presenter,This product has been very useful and has worked great. The only problem has been that the laser pointer function on this remote sometimes just dissapears while I am using it. But I have had this problem on many other laser pointers.
4,Excellent peice of device,"Just loved the idea of not installing any drivers or software to use this. Just plug and play. Helpful when any presentation runs from any other laptop than yours. Plug in the adapter in the laptop, laptop detects the presenter and yopu are ready to go. Vibrator on the presenter is an innovative idea but I don't use it much though.Everything you would want from a remote presenter and more at a great price.4 star because the cover which came along with this seems to be sub standard. One can see clearly that its stitches can come off anytime. Its one size small, but ok to go with.."
5,I like this product,I like this product. It is everything that I wanted in the product. I especially like the screen blanking button.
4,John Leong's Review of the logitech 2.4 GHz Cordless Presenter,The product is excellent for a professional presentation. It has all the features necessary to allow one to roam freely in the presentation room and interact with the audience.
4,awesome presenter,PROS: TRANSITION FROM A DISTANCE. CONTROL THE VOLUME BY REMOTE (REALLY NEAT). BLACKEN THE SCREEN!CONS: LASER COULD BE A LITTLE STRONGER! NOT A MOUSE POINTER.
5,Fantastic tool,"This divice makes power point presentations a breeze to present without having to be stuck at a podium with a mouse or the laptop. Advancing the slides is as easy as the touch of a button. There is a built in pointer, and even a timer and black screen option. I can't believe we've managed without it for so long."
1,Not a good laser pointer,"It's always a problem when use it as a laser pointer. I got it in September and used only once for lecture (80 min). The second time, the laser pointer did not function, no lasing! I requested for an exchange from Amazon that responded quickly. For the second piece, I used about 5 times, and then the laser does not lase. It sucks. I do not know how to do with it. Further exchange or request for refunds? I have already discarded the package. Headache."
4,Plays well with Mac.,"This thing works great with Keynote. The only function that doen't work with Keynote is the black screen function (so only 4 stars). That function DOES work, however, with NeoOffice presenter. I love it. Great range and the buttons respond just fine, despite what a couple have people have said."
4,Solid performer...,Operates as advertised. Worked right out of the package. Laser is strong. Very intuitive to operate.
4,Great gadget but needs minute timer options,"This gadgets has ALMOST all the ideal perks. It really needs to allow the presenter to choose the time for the signaled vibrations. I mean, not every presentaion is to last 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, etc. How much more do I need to pay to be able to set my own time limit?"
5,Very Happy with Logitech Cordless Presenter,"I run a large real estate training operation if Florida and we have 12 Logitech Cordless Presenters that we use for training and seminars. We are very pleased with their range, size and ease of use at a very affordable cost."
4,Very Good Presentation Remote,"This is a great little device with which to control presentations. The vibrating timer is a great function and has numerous time settings, though there is no function allowing one to enter a custom time. The laser is bright and focused, and the button is easy to press and in a comfortable location. The wireless receiver for the remote fits nicely inside the body of the remote, which has its own protective case. One nice feature is that no software must be installed for this to operate, unlike some other remotes which can become cumbersome with all that must be done in order for them to operate. Overall, this is a very good product and functions exactly as advertised/described."
5,Great Presentation/Lecture Aid,"I teach at university level, and like to walk around among the students while lecturing and interacting. I use PowerPoint heavily and this tool gives me much freedom and convencience."
4,Logitech 2.4 GHz Cordless Presenter,Excelent device. Have purchased about eight of this in the past !One minor function that I wished could be better is the timer on the unit. I wished that timer can be set to any number rather than in a fixed incriment. But it works.
4,"Nice, functional tool","Technical presentations are part of my job, to groups of 20 to 50 people. I tend to move around a bit as I present, and have slides with some animation, so the presenter has been great in allowing me to present without having to go back to my computer and press buttons to advance or animate the PowerPoints that I use. I think that there are other presenters with more functionality, but this has what I need, and it has served its purpose very well. It is compact and light, and can be plugged into any computer and used without installation of software."
5,Wireless Presenter - 2.4 Logitech,"LOGITECH, INC. / LOG9313070403 / Cordless Presenter, 2.4 GHz, Integrated Laser Pointer, Black/Silver / Sold as 1 EAThe presenter is very comfortable in the hand. It uses 2 ""AAA"" batteries - easy to find when it time to replace. Having both a laser and a timer on the unit is very useful - 3 tools in 1. This was a great purchase."
5,I like it,"It is really good, the first presentation remote control I have, and I guess I will use it for a long time."
3,Worked great for a while,"I've been using this product for about 18 months, several times per week in a classroom setting. It's been great--I've never plugged it into anything it didn't work with and the battery life has been fantastic. However, the laser pointer recently started going in and out, unfortunately beginning during my husband's dissertation defense. I've changed the batteries to no effect. Sometimes when I press the button there's a red dot, and sometimes there isn't. Hitting it against the heel of my hand will get a response, but that's a little distracting every 30 second during a lecture! Maybe it keeps my students awake...Incidentally, there's an easy driver download to get the presenter to work with Windows 7."
4,not quite perfect,"It works splendidly, no matter how far I walk around the room. I love the volume function. I also like the vibration that tells me I have five minutes left. The only drawback is, as other people have mentioned, there is no cursor control, so when I want to access a website, I have to go back to the computer. In general, I prefer to keep time by countdown rather than looking at the clock. The timer element, then, was a real selling point for me."
5,Great product for Powerpoint road-warriors,"This is the 4th remote presentation controller I have owned in a decade and is by far the best. By best I am referring to the ergonomics (size and weight-it fits discretely & comfortably in the hand), reliability (doesn't ""miss"" clicks, even in large auditoriums), and features.For me the key ""everyday"" features are the countdown timer on the remote (that has a display of time remaining and also sounds/vibrates warnings), the detachable USB dongle (that fits inside the main body when not in use, and so is less likely to get lost) and the ability to ""blackout"" the displayed screen (useful if you want to pause your presentation for audience participation or at a break).In common with many remotes the Logitech also includes a laser pointer which works OK but like the others is somewhat weak especially against a white/light slide background.Overall, a great product at a good price."
5,Works great:,"Works great, light, fits in hands well. It works fine on Macs (OS X) too, but the product description says any windows based PC."
5,Perfect for office needs,"I had trouble finding a remote that could transmit through the wall and/or door where the PC equipment was. The Logitech had no problem. In addition to that - the black screen and escape funtions are great, not to mention the timer - great for board meetings with limited time. Great buy for the money!"
4,nice,"very good. But the first item I ordered didn't work within 20 days. So I called Amazon to send me a replacement. So far, the second one works good."
4,It works well.,"Well it does what it is supposed to. The timer is particularly helpful. Vibrates strong, and the red led laser is great too. One word of advise, the LCD screens have an anti reflective coating on them, so if the presentation you plan to give is on an LCD monitor/screen/display, the laser would just pass through, and you WONT be able to see the red dot.The only combination i have used it is in Vista/powerpoint 2007, and it works like a charm, just plug and play. No need to install anything."
2,Poor design,Button for laser pointer become to work erratically after several weeks of use. As far as I know this is a general problem of all of these presenters. Beware.
