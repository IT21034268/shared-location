3,"Good story, lousy history","The story itself is entertaining, but the errors in history are astounding. Sir Thomas More, whom the hero asked to investigate the death of the two princes, was actually a boy of five when Richard III took the throne, and only seven at the time of the battle of Bosworth, and his knighthood was decades in the future; everything he wrote about the murder plot was thirdhand hearsay at best. And Henry and Richard never faced each other on the battlefield; Henry, in fact, took little or no part in the battle. This would have been easy research to do, but somehow it wasn't done."
4,Good knife for the money,Great knife for the money. I bought it for the size and the gut hook. The gut hook wasn't as sharp as I would have liked it to be. But overall the knife worked well on the Black Tail deer I harvested last fall in Kodiak.Why spend $200+ on a knife when you don't use it very often??
5,Best deer skinning knife.,This knife fits well in your hand and the way it is designed allows you to skin your deer without cutting into the stomach.
3,Quite nice...,helped me a lot with my insomnia... An entirely implausible story and -seemingly- rushed to be put together...Now that I've read all Clancy (except Ops Centre) and Di Mercurio... what's left? (favvy@yahoo.com)
1,waste of money,"The fun lasted 1 or 2 brushings before becoming boring. Didn't make him want to brush his teach any more than before buying it. Neat science activity, though, at least the first time my son tried it."
4,Great book for toddlers!,I bought this book for my elephant obsessed 8 month old. She was really into lift-the-flap books at the time. This book is not for babies but rather older toddlers. I put it away and am looking forward to picking it up in a year or so.
5,Do yourself a favor!,"How this novel escaped wider attention is simply beyond me. Jack Warner delivers a brilliant book based on what should have been a campy premise: Huge Bengal tiger escapes from a circus train that is travelling through the southern US, and begins a killing spree. A friend told me about the hardcover from Tor, and I took a chance and picked it up. In a word, brilliant. The characters are fleshed out and deftly drawn, the suspense effective, and the prose both lean and literate. Do yourself a favor and check this one out. Now."
5,Maneater by Jack Warner,"I read every day and this is one of the best books I have ever read and I have read a lot of books over the last 40 years. My husband is reading this right now and he can hardly put it down. I love to read books by Dean Koontz, Stephen King, Lee Childs, John Sandford and many others. The characters in this book come alive, I laughed, cried, and was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole book. I hope Jack Warner is writing more books because he is on my list as ""must have more of his books""."
5,Suspensful,"Truly after reading the reviews written by previous readers about this book, i just had to read the book. I was intrigued ultimately about the premise of the story, a bengal tiger lose in north Georgia, AWESOME. Reading the first half of the story i found comparisons to that of the movie ""Jaws"", mystique, suspense, and great story telling both depicted by Warner and Speilber. The second half of the story then wandered a bit from the roots and went into a metaphorical shift to ones manhood. But i do truly wish many to read this story which i couldnt put down!!! Also Jim Grahams character in this story is truly charasmatic and geniune!! READ IT"
3,am I the only one who likes this book?,"Well, I liked it. I don't think the other reviews were terribly fair. It wasn't Shakespaere or Sartre, but it wasn't awful either. The characters weren't terribly deep, but I can forgive that. And anyone who is judging this based on the plausibility of its premise really hasn't read much sci-fi at all.I agree with another reviewer that it's a little hard to believe that much of the machinery would still be working after a century of disuse. But that doesn't detract from the story. And it's nothing compared with the suspension of disbelief required for some of the ""new"" flying machines featured in the story."
2,Say Goodbye to Hello,Wonderful premise! Awful execution! It's a tough experience to be 50 pages when one realizes that a book does not live up to expectations....at page 75 realize it shall not get better...at page 100 see that one is so bored there is too much temptation to give up. Listen to that temptation. It is unfathomable how a well-regard novelist wrote such a poor book and that no editor saved or stopped the book before it consumed several hours of my time with no gain to me.
1,Embarrassingly implausible,"I regret that I cannot recommend ""Hello America."" In fact, it got so silly at times that it was embarrassing. J.G. Ballard is a British writer whose perception of America is, to say the least, a little too broad. The book's premise (the whole population of the United States flees to Europe in the 2030s, then the whole continent is turned to desert when the Bering Strait is dammed) and characters (nutcases all) were totally implausible. The attempted humor falls flat because the author is taking his premise so seriously, but the premise falls flat because the characters and their adventures are so ridiculous."
1,too big,This paci is too big. My daughter gags and pushes it out of her mouth. Takes too long. I think it is worth it to get an ear thermometer instead.
2,hoof knife,I ordered this because the picture shows a slim blade hoof knife. When I received my order I got a thick bladed knife.
4,Perfect fit,"Perfect fit with mirror pocket placement and antenna placement for my 01 Audi TT QuattroThough antenna pocket is little big, it's still where it's supposed to be.I just wish it was thicker material perhaps multi layered.It looks like just thick nylon cover where oters are fabric based with soft touch.But the best thing about it is that it fits perfectly~1st weeks into the use and it was uncovered by wind.2nd week and it got uncovered when I came home from work. Fortunately the cover was flapping within the fence.3rd week...I lost it. When I came home, the cover was gone. It was a windy day.If the cover was tad bit larger so it covers into the lower bumper, it would not have been uncovered by the wind."
3,Good action.,This book starts pretty strong. Alot of good action and an idea that really isn't that bad. But I think the problem with the book is it's length. It is one of the bigger books in the Mack Bolan series and there are times when the plot really does disappear behind the action. But if you are a fan of the series then you will enjoy it.
4,A practical guide for new adult learners of Polish,B.W. Mazurs colloqial POLISH provides good practical examples for adults trying to learn Polish for the first time. I have tried several other books which have also been quite good however some are a little short on detailed examples. This book seems to me to suceed better than some because multiple examples are often used. I found the practice section examples at the end of each lesson to be well chosen.
4,Love itself cannot protect us till it acts (omitted above),"I'd forgotten this song, in the review above. Consulting the Oracle (The Songs of Bob Franke), something that can be done when others are asleep, and playing the album is not okay, I find that Predictions, is a song written in memory of his brother in law. It *will* leave you crying. If you've ever lost someone close to you to a debilitating disease or accident, this will speak to you. If you are going through this process, and you don't know how long it will be until the end, this song will tell you what you can expect.It's a gentle, lyrical farewell. It's a song about letting go of what we thought we knew, and of not letting go of love. Bob's big on not letting go of loving--and so should we all be."
2,"Not worth buying, handle breaks","Needed a new chisel to carry in my tool belt while framing and doing general construction, nothing high precision, so I thought this would be handy, with the rasp faces. I figured with a name like Nicholson, it had to be good stuff.First day on the site, I hit the back end with a hammer to set it into a deck joist, the handle shattered by the tang of the chisel. In other words, the tang of the chisel does not go all the way thru the handle to the striking cap, so when you hit the cap, the tang acts like a wedge and splits the handle open.Took it back to Lowes that afternoon, it still looked brand new except for the shattered handle. Bummer."
5,Great Cleanser--it lasts forever!,"Just a little pump of this stuff each day keeps your skin nice and clean, but not too dry. I have sensitive skin that tends to get oily--Olivella has been great. So many products overdry, not this stuff. I highly recommend it.By the way, my husband uses it too. We've had our bottle for 8 or 9 months--a little goes a long way, so it's pretty economical. Smells pleasant, too."
2,Not Exactly What I Expected,"I was looking for a clean soap for my face and decided to give this Olive Oil soap a try. I have used it twice and both times was left with a kind of film on my skin. It didn't exactly rinse off clean and my skin felt like it had hand cream on it. I even used a wash cloth to try and get the residue off. No luck. The scent isn't sweet at all, which is all right. I didn't expect it to have a strong scent. It just isn't the soap for me. Also I read the side label and its ingredients. I did not see ""olive oil"" in its list. So who knows what those chemicals are that I am putting on my face. This olive soap probably works for most people, but for me it was a great disappointment."
1,Not a good thing,"I was initially pleased to find an olive oil based soap for sale, but this was a profound disappointment. I tried it on my hands when it arrived. The first thing I noticed was the smell. It is strongly (!) perfumed and smells like cheap cologne.It cleans perfectly well, but my hands were left feeling stretched and dry, later itchy with a film on them. The itch subsided after I washed again with my usual soap. It is possible that I am sensitive to cheap cologne, but who would imagine an olive oil based soap would smell so horrible? It says in the description that it is a ""fresh, herbal green scent"", but not so.Be warned. If you don't want to smell like that, don't buy this soap. It's not cheap in price, unfortunately."
2,Leaked bottle.,"This soap seemed like it would have been really nice, but I wouldn't know since mine arrived leaking all over the place. It was inside a ziplock which helped contain most of the mess, but it was still all over everything. I would like to order more but not going to take the chance."
2,Ouch...a sticky mess...,This product leaves alot to be desired... it does not remove all the hair... and the little hair that it does remove is torturous...i still had to end up in the waxing salon after this...better luck next time i guess...
2,Does not work very well on course hair,I have struggled with this product for a few weeks and it still gives me grief. I'm going back to threading.
1,"never buy it, its not hair removal","i bought it ,but i try to many time,but no results, its painful and removes only 2 or 3 hair at lease ,after my skin was redness ,u need use when it too hot, if too hut burned ur skin,never buy it,save ur money"
1,Sticky Mess!,"I thought this would be totally different from other waxes I've used, but it wasn't. It's sticky and it's only saving grace regarding that is that it is easily wiped off with water. It's messy and it does need to be heated majority of the time. It's also not very effective. The waxes I've used hurt but they removed the hair, not this stuff. It hurts and barely any hair is removed. I won't be buying it again."
2,Question,Does anyone know if this is great for pubic hair ? I know it sounds gross but thats what I'm looking for most .
1,nad's ruined my life,"when making a product say the name to a 13 year old and see if they laugh if they do you might just be a redneck,Thanks guys have a great night"
3,Good Stuff,Though while it's meant to be a no heat wax I have to heat it up because for some reason the wax looked like it had be frozen or something. But once I heated it up it worked fine. Overall my order arrived in a timely manner and I was pleased with the product.
4,Not bad,"I've used many waxes and I always find myself looking for Nad's. It works about as good as the others, hurts no matter what kind you use. What I like best is that it cleans up easily with water."
1,Save your money,"This was a very disappointing product. The wax/gel is very hard and extremely difficult to spread. The directions say nothing about needing to heat the product, but I found I had to keep popping it into the microwave to soften it enough to try to use it. The cleaning pads are so thin, they act like wet tissue and wad up when used - useless. There are only 5 cloth strips enclosed, so that is enough to do almost half of one leg. What a waste! Pass on this one. There has to be something better out there."
1,"Messy, Messy, Messy!","I'm no stranger to waxing so I had no qualms about trying Nads for the first time. Never again! This stuff is extremely messy, and didn't work well. Did I mention how MESSY it is? I had this gel all over my bathroom counter. Yuck. Save your money. I recommend the Sally Hansen wax. You have to heat it in the microwave, but it's easy and very effective."
3,nads,I was intrigued with this product since the info-mercials. In real life it's very messy and only removes some of the hair. I would not buy this product again.
5,The best Wax hair removal hands down,"I have tried all kinds of Wax products for my legs and bikini area, this is hands down the best, I used ZIP wax for years, which had to be heated, was messy, smelled and stuck to my clothes, skin, etc. and burned.NADS is so simple, just put a layer on, put muslin on top and hair is gone, also if you get some on your hands it tastes like candy, No mess, just put water on your legs and it comes right off. My only problem is I wish the jar came in a larger size, With one jar i can wax both my lower legs and my thighs but need one more for the bikini area."
4,Don't shave for weeks.,I've used this product before and I'm glad I found it here at Amazon. It works great. The only problem is that there isn't enough cloth stripes to do both legs. Easy clean up.
2,Avoid if you are going to use for your nether regions.,"One word: Sticky. I prefer the Nads bikini wax product for the nether regions. I found this product a mess to use. By the end of it all, my fingers and hands were all sticky, not to mention the areas that I attempted to remove hair. Imagine maple syrup sticky. While the instructions say you can reuse the cloth strips, I really found that advice rather dubious and some what gross. I know other reviewers have praised this product, and perhaps it works better for legs and such, but don't use this for your bikini area. I don't recommend that, unless sticky is your thing."
4,Great - and painless!!,"I bought this product in the US from because I knew the brand from Australia. I had to warm the wax for 15 secs in the mricrowave. I have to say, i was pleasantly suprised - it was practically painless. I found this wax to be similar to salon quality. I will def buy again and reccomend to all. I read the other negative reviews and suspect that others are using too much wax (it says to only use a thin layer). I'm guessing this $5 jar will last me a good 6 months if i use it once a month."
1,"Worst decision EVER,","I used this product on my chest and stomach, which was a HUGE mistake. Immediately after using it I was covered in red bumps, hairs were missed, and I developed the worst ingrown hairs of my life. This product ruined my skin and my summer. Men, do not use it."
4,Definitely recommend,"GREAT product. I only gave it 4 stars because I wish a larger quantity was given for the same price; I used more than half for just my legs.still, great results and the washable strips are genius"
4,Book for horse loving children,The book is written in 4 chapters that could be read individually at 4 different sessions. Each tells its own story. The illustrations are clear and concise using bright colors. Children that love horses would like this book. I used it as a read-aloud story at the library but a reader of about 1st grade level would have no trouble reading it.
2,Horse not likeable for discerning young reader,"My 6 year old daughter was not happy with this book. She loves horses but told me she didn't like the character Cocoa because he was not diligent, made excuses for not doing his work, and then never got consequences for his poor attitude. I was very convicted to be much more careful in selecting reading material for her. I eventually found the C.W. Anderson horse stories and we were all much happier. My daughter was finally excited to read.Billy And Blaze: A Boy And His Horse"
4,Cowgirl Kate is GREAT!,"My 5 year old daughter has recently entered a stage where horses are IT, and this is a great book to tie her love of horses with her love of bedtime stories. It's fun to read about this adventurous cowgirl and her, always hungry, cowhorse. To top it off it is a beautifully illustrated book, my daughter loved the bright, fun pictures."
4,Delonghi Elite,Attractive oven toaster broiler.The timer is the old fashioned mechanical kind.Can't cancel the cook time without spinning a mechanical wheelall the way around to off position.Easy to remove crumb tray. Very shiny steel. Nothing sticks to it.
4,Great Movie,"Loved this movie! It has some great humor and very tender moments with a great ending! You'll laugh, cry and be touched by these ""real people""."
4,A Good One,"Great story delivered by four good actors that are willing to step outside of themselves and show us why we want to see more from James, Glen, Kevin and Mary."
3,Story line and plot was good.,"Liked this movie, the story line and plot was good. I especially liked Glenn Close's role in this movie. I would recommend this movie for someone looking for an unselfish view of doing the right thing even when you don't feel like it or it hurts a lot."
4,Nice Film,"This is an entertaining and touching film. It is at times very predictable, and the movie takes a condescending and stereotypical approach to teen birthmothers, but ultimately it is a good film, well worth seeing, and certainly entertaining."
5,I loved it from beginning to end,"I really enjoyed this movie. Being a parent I can understand the longing to have a child and not being able to. Up until the time that I saw Immediate Family I had never seen Woods and Close in this type of role. They were great. I also loved the music. If you're sentimental like myself, pull out the hankie."
5,Wonderful movie,This is one of the sweetest films I've ever seen. I absolutely love Glen Close as Lynda Spector in this movie and the ending could not be more heartfelt and touching.
2,bug light bugs me!!,"Picture is misleading - appears to have a clear coating to deter bugs. But it's actually the same as all of those yellow coated bug lights. And, does NOT work - have just as many moths - same as before using regular floods. And uses more watts - regular was 50W, these are 85W with no added benefit for added wattage."
1,Broken on Arrival,"The bulb was broken on arrival. Given the hassle factor of the return, replaced it at local retailer. Downside to internet purchasing."
1,richard connells the most dangerous game,I couldn't read it because I couldn't get it on adobe reader. extremely frustrating!
1,Too brief to be of any real use,This book is little more than a list of tourist destinations in Southern Africa. Budget accomodation is limited and information about the places listed is non-existant. Everything in this book could be found out with a few quick google searches. Save your money.
3,ZAMBIA Bradt Travel Guide,"The book is good in general terms although up to date jul 2007 is a non updated in certain chapters (flights, taxi fares, lack of more buses info between villages..)Is good reading to learn facts on the country.To travel to Zambiais a good thing to buy"
1,Clown,It will be easier for a camel to walk through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven. Well Patty Boy I hope you have been training one hell of a camel because otherwise you are going to be mighty hot for an eternity. This man is a intolerant bigot.
1,"AGAIN SHOWING CHRISTIAN LOVE...THROUGH HATE,INTOLERENCE LEADING TO VIOLENCE","ANOTHER HYPROCRITICAL NUT. THESE CHRISTIAN FUNDAMENTALISTS LIKE ARE LITERALLY SCREAMING JESUS,WHILE CUTTING YOUR THROATS, NOT UNLIKE THE JIHADI FUNDAMENTALISTS. THE ONLY THING IS THEY CANT DO THAT NOW AS THEY USED TO COUPLE OF HUNDRED YEARS BACK BY ENSLAVING AND LYNCHING BLACKS,KILLING NATIVE AMERICANS,AND SHOWING THEIR CHRISTIAN LOVE FOR THE JEWS- BY EXTERMINATING THEM. HOPE OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS DONT HAVE TO LIVE IN A CHRISTIAN SAUDI ARABIA. THIS IS WHAT THESE WHACKOS ENVISION."
5,Good Book,"Not an easy read. I'll have to read it again. Highly detailed book, but the premise and information is worth considering. This information will open your eyes beyond the typical political understandings. Robertson gets into the money sources that may be seeking world political control and domination. He traces the threads into the 1800s and brings them up to the time the book was written. I used to think there were only liberals and conservatives. Now I see there could be more to politics. So much to learn."
5,Outstanding self teaching tool for EE's,"The book covers a lot. See the Table of Contents. The main thing to note about this book is the writing style. It is incredibly easy to read and learn from. Even seasoned professionals will find plenty to justify the purchase. I think its strongest usage should be with EE students. I recommend it highly for EE students as it covers much more than straight EMC material. Like circuit analysis, transform operations, circuit design,electromagnetic theory. It takes time to explain many everday things in good detail as examples of theory application.True the paper is thin. You can see through it to the content on the other side but you quickly get used to this. Suggestion for the next edition is break it into two volumes and use better paper."
1,norton internet security for dummies,"There was absolutely nothing in this book that helped me learn about Norton Internet Security. I want the meaning of the different security messages, more details about the settings. It was an empty book to me."
3,Decent item; as described,"The item is of decent quality and arrived as described. I have no complaints, but one critique of this particular layout is that there is an abnormally high amount of slots for rings both in the jewelry box itself as well as the accompanying travel case. If you have a lot of rings and/or small earrings, this set will work just fine for you; however, it doesn't leave much room in the travel case for necklaces, bracelets and bulky earrings."
4,Lots of room,This jewelry box is awesome I love all the compartments and storage the lock and handle so I can hide it and carry out fast if I have to
3,"Beautiful, big, but arrived defective","I received this product and loved it, but it arrived with a defect. The clasp lock was broken. I was disappointed. I am returning it, but not sure if I will order a replacement. The clasp seemed flimsy and I don't want to order it again with the same problem. Did anyone that ordered this find that the clasp is flimsy?"
2,"HD-DVD on the outside, Blu-ray on the inside","I bought this box set from Amazon since the doomed HD-DVD format discs are a pretty good deal these days. When I received it, I was a little confused since the plastic wrapping had a sticker on it that read: ""For use only with Blu-Ray players and drives"" but sure enough, the box cover inside read ""HD-DVD"" right across the top so I opened it up. You bet I was surprised when I found three Blu-Ray discs inside. I guess I can't really complain much since the Blu-Ray version of this set retails for $50 where the HD-DVD set was $37. I guess I'll sell these to some lucky BD player owner and try for an actual HD-DVD set myself."
2,not what expected,"I'm sure the product is fine. It is the HD DVD version which I didn't realize won't run on a 'regular' DVD player. Before you order, verify that you have the right equipment or it won't play."
4,collector's must have,"If you have a movie library, then you must add the ocean's trilogy to it! All three movies are great"
5,ocean's 11 12 13,"Movies like this are right up there with scar face and the godfather. The movie is intelligent without being over your head and it is fast paced enough to keep your attention. The continuity is great i love how they kept each actor in their role all throughout the trilogy, and I know how difficult that can be to accomplish. Don't just watch one of these watch all of them. They are hours of fun for the whole family"
4,good movies,"the Ocean movies do not disappoint, They were delivered in a timely manner and in perfect condition. The movies are great (my favorite is the first one, Oceans eleven)."
3,Game of Wits,"Entertainer and witty. Eleven and Thirteen are engrossing, Twelve is a slam-dunk....Big starcast...excellent performance, Eleven is the best of the three. Can watch with family."
3,An excellent box set,"This is a great boxset for fans of the Oceans Trilogy. Complete with all the 3 parts, this makes an excellent addition to my collection. I would say there is not many additional features or so that may impress me tremendously.Most importantly, there is value for money."
3,Acceptable but not great,"Ocean's Eleven a very noisy picture and although better than my DVD copy, it falls far short of what Blu-Ray can offer. Good plot and good acting.Ocean's Twelve is much better Blu-Ray quality, but the film production is highly stylized and distracting, rather 60's in the way they use different transitions, cuts and grotesque zooms. The plot is much weaker - and far less plausible - than Eleven, and the acting rather wooden at times.I haven't watched Thirteen yet, but hope it is the movie caliber of Eleven with the Blu-Ray quality of Twelve."
4,OCEAN'S TRILOGY,HD QUALITY IS GREAT MOVIES ARE GOOD DELIVERY WAS FAST AND IN GOOD CONDITION I WOULD PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN.
4,DVD Ocean's Triology,Daughter is a big fan of George Clooney and the Ocean's Triology series. She enjoyed the DVD Ocean's Triology present.
3,Decent Movies - Amoung the Worst Blu Ray Transfer,"I enjoyed the movies my self and looked forward to the BD release, but when I put them in my player and noticed the almost DVD quality video I felt ripped off. There are numerous artifacts through out the movies and bad colors. Buy with caution."
1,Fake Blu Ray,"I ordered the Blu Ray Ocean's Trilogy, and it is horrible quality. It looks like it is a pirated version, which is too bad because I gave it to my husband for Christmas- and it was disappointing."
2,Worst Bluray Transfer Ever !!!,I have just finished Ocean's 12. Not even dare to open 13 as next. I have never and ever experienced the worst quality of bluray transfer on any movie since I started to own player and bluray products. This is the worst. Trust me. I felt regret not to trust the previous review.
5,Great gift,"My husband loved this. Three great flicks on blu-ray. If you love gambling and casinos, and thriller movies, then try this combo pack!"
2,Oceans 11 is the decent one,"I bought this triology because I had liked Oceans 11 and I thought the other 2 would be just as good. I was wrong. Oceans 12 & 13 seemed like the writers were trying tio fish for a story line. They aren't bad just not what I was looking for. There didn't be any element of surprise, you knew what was going to happen who was going to do what. Very predictable."
2,Unfortunately don't work,"I have no review for the actual films as I can not watch them. I have now purchased two distinct copies of the trilogy on HD DVD and on both sets Ocean's 11 and 12 do not work, but 13 does. I have tested the movies on multiple HD DVD players. On my Xbox 360 add on player it just doesn't read them. In stand alone players they lock up. Be wary when purchasing this set, I know they aren't ALL like this."
1,not good,I bought this movie and couldnt play it at all.....because its hd dvd which is a dead technology so my question is why would you still sell it if people cant watch it in dvds???? smh never again
2,missing,When we finally opened the trilogy set to watch them the oceans 13 was missing completely no case nothing if only I could figure out how to get it but this site is no help
2,Dissappointed,"Ocean's Eleven was scratched and did not play well. There was a hand written note stating this attached to the inside of the trilogy box, but it was not mentioned on the sales screen. I would not have purchased it had I known. It took two weeks to arrive, also a dissappointment. I don't recommend this vendor."
1,"Didn't need to be done, let alone three times","This is the quintessential example of Hollywood greed. If you actually thought Ocean's 11 was a decent remake, you can't buy it. You've got to pay for the horrific remakes done twice where this famous 21st century brat pack of actors were paid a ransom to have a blast and horse around without a script and take advantage of a franchise name. Perhaps the worst trilogy around, you have to have rocks in your head to want to pay over $50 for the ""privilege"" of owning all three. Wait a few weeks for this to be in the clearance rack and pick it up for few quarters. Shame on the studios and may you take a beating on this disgraceful attempt to capitalize on your monopoly."
4,Excellent video quality,It's a great value for money package for Hi-Def Movie lovers. All the three movies are amazingly entertaining in their unique way.
5,Great1,I'm very happy with the purchase! It's in excellent condition and I'd buy another copy to give as a gift.
3,Great Movies. Terrible on Blu Ray!,"I had high expectations for the Blu Ray version of this series, but this was a let down. A usual, the movies were great... Highly entertaining. But the big let down was the quality of the Blu Ray version. It didn't look any better than the DVD version. And then there was the grain. SO MUCH grain. Honestly, it was very disappointing. The only upside to this whole thing is that I bought when it was on sale during Cyber Monday.Bottom line is: Buy the series if it's on sale. If not, then opt for the regular, cheaper DVD version instead."
3,Good movies; HORRIBLE QUALITY,"I bought this because it was $18 for a blu-ray trilogy, which is pretty crazy. I had actually never seen all the movies. I was sure the third would be the worst, but that is actually my favorite, and that was the one I'd never seen before. So the movies are great; I really enjoy them. EXCEPT for the quality. People aren't kidding when they say this is the worst blu-ray movie quality they've ever seen. I don't know what the DVDs look like, but they might look about the same as this. But if you think about it, $18 is still an ok price for 3 DVDs. The third movie is definitely the best quality. Some scenes have some pretty impressive Vegas scenery.So bottom line, I still think the price is worth it, if you're paying around $18. Under no circumstances should anyone pay over $20 for this. It's just not good enough quality to warrant that."
2,Bad Blu-Ray Versions,They did a poor job in making the Blu-Ray versions. The video quality stinks. Many scenes are grainy or without true high-resolution.
1,Bad watch,"We were really excited to get this book for our son who is just learning to tell time. It looked cool and we have had good experiences with other Klutz books. Unfortunately the watch never worked. We set the time, read through the book and practiced a bit. But the next morning when we looked again the hands on the watch had not moved at all.It's too bad too since the pictures in the book matched the watch I think this would have been a helpful tool to teach our son to tell time. They should have invested as much time creating a good watch as they did creating a good book!"
1,Watch never worked.,"My four year old received this as a gift. The book is really good, but the watch never worked. I thought maybe it had a bad battery, but after reading three other reviews on Amazon, I may not replace the battery. She can read the book, and practice on her learning clock."
1,This product contains parabens,"This product contains parabens, a chemical preservative that is thought to be linked to cancer tumors. I would highly recommend avioding this product until the parabens are removed."
2,Inconsistant,"The first one we tried worked very well. It stuck on well, did not bother my child's skin and seemed to display an accurate temp. The second one never showed a fever even tho we verified that she did have one. I am no longer willing to trust that it will tell me, and feel like you can get as accurate information from putting your hand on their forehead."
1,Do not work at all,"Very disappointed, I thought these would at least get me in the ball park of my kid's temperature. They were reading 95-97 degrees when he had a 101 fever! Completely useless. Never even registered body temp."
5,"Simple, concise, defining, and loving -- as it should be!","Real world, down-to-earth, in a realm too often seen as fantasy or historical, is how MacNutt approaches the healing work of a loving God. Scripturally supported throughout, this is an explanation of Christian healing, a straight-forward 'how-to' erasing much of the mystery many Christians and skeptics have surrounding the healing Jesus called His disciples to offer the broken. It powerfully affirms the healing work of Jesus, alive and occurring daily, even now. He provides practical answers, numerous experiences of his and others' and, at the same time, demonstrates the humility of walk in admitting those things to which he still cannot offer clear and simple answers, things beyond his understanding. This is a handbook for healing ministers, a book of testimony to instill faith in the unhealed that they can be healed, and a treasure for the Christian Church."
5,God loves you,"He loves you and wants you healed. Books like this will build up your faith and get you started. More advanced: ""A More Excellent Way"" by Henry Wright and ""Blessings and Curses"" by Derek Prince."
5,Great product,"The ""used"" book I ordered was in excellent condition! It came on time and at a great price. I'm glad I ordered from Amazon."
5,WONDERFUL WRITER,This book is fabulous! I could almost read the entire book all the way through. The writing flows so well and the writer keeps you so intrigued with what will happen next that you cannot put the book down.
5,Could not put it down . . .,"This was one of the most exciting books that I have read in a long time. It's worth getting a used copy, as it is no longer in print. The story was so suspenseful (and romantic too). I kept telling myself, ""Just one more chapter."""
1,Don't waste your money,"On my Nissan Maxima this blade misses a large section of the windscreen at the end of the blade, even when there is no snow or ice. I would not recommend these blades to anyone."
2,"26"" wiper",thought i was getting a deal but wipers didnt really do thier job. would leave streaks and not hit the window completly unless the defrost was on high and the windows were warmed up. passanger side was better but still not what youd expect. Have a toyota corolla 2010
1,Not as advertised,"2GB MP3 / WMA player w/ USB Flash Drive & Voice Recorder $ Built -in FM Radio & 7 Colors Backlight LCD (RED)Received MP3 player. Manual in 3 font print. Translation to English very poor. Instructions not clear. Would not load music. Gave error messages. On closer look, it already had a music file on it. The entire drive is ""write protected"" used?? not new. Waiting to hear back from seller"
5,GREAT ITEM!!!,This item is excellent. It works perfectly and hold plenty of songs for a short trip and also serve great as a usb storage drive. It's small enough for me to take any where I go and I love using it to listen to musics while I'm running. Great buy for the price. I would recommend it to anyone.
2,Only average for either atlas or travel guide,"I'm a huge fan of maps and an avid traveler, so I was eager to get my hands on this Atlas from the publishers of the Eyewitness Guides series.Unfortunately, it's disappointingly mediocre. The maps are light on detail and rather plain, the travel information is superficial, and about half the book is index pages for the low-detail maps. So it turns out to be both a poor atlas, and a not very good travel guide.It's not terrible either, but not worth the money. If you'd like to browse through country information from a traveler's perspective, tryLonely Planet the Travel Book: A Journey Through Every Country in the World. There are also many fine atlases out there, such as the classic from National GeographicNational Geographic Atlas of the World, Eighth Edition.This one is not recommended."
3,"Adorable, sizing runs small, terrible return process","This dress is absolutely adorable!! Too bad the sizes run REALLY small. I ordered a small (4-6), thinking that since my child wears a 4-5T we'd be in luck. Nope, the bodice is a bit snug, and the return process is such that I can't exchange it for a larger size. Costume Supercenter requires that all returns be completed within 10 days of shipping... (their shipping date) which actually meant that I had about TWO actual days of trying on > deciding whether to return > being out of luck.So, my daughter will be able to wear this dress for Halloween, and then never again because it's too snug. Not the optimal situation for spending $30 on a dress-up costume, but such is the situation.Although the outfit is very cute, and appears to be well-made, I will not be purchasing online from this vendor ever again. Customer service is important to me, and I will spend my hard-earned cash on vendors who deliver it."
4,Hold everything,"I received this bag just before a quick overnight trip. Not wanting to check any luggage I was able to carry all of my personal items as well as work files. It expands and is perfect for trips with the kids.The pockets are great, there is a place for everything so things do not get lost in a huge tote bag. The handles are comfortable on your shoulder."
1,boring,"I actually bought Step 2, not Step 1. The guy at the music store told me people had complained about Step 1 being too simplistic. Step 2 was painfully boring. A drumming video should be fun! Most of the time is spent explaining to people how to keep time in 4/4 time. And he shows you how to do something called the ""slap"". I wish I hadn't wasted my money."
2,promotional video,"although the video could be helpfull for the very beginners,it should be free when a Primo brand drum is purchased.I was disapointed when i watched it because there was not areal djembe on the set,i could not believe the statment that the secret is in the glue,iwas laughing at that .thank you for having these reviews,have i read one on this video,i would've not purchased it,and would'nt have to hassle with returning it."
1,promotional,"although the video could be helpful to the very beginner in drummming ,it should be given away with every Remo drum purchase.furthermore there was not one real Djembe on the set.Iwas also disappointed when the statment was made that the secret is in the glue.I wish there was a review of this item befor having purchased it,and having to trouble with returning it.Thanks for having the reviews."
2,"Diamond FN15"" Nippers",This is the second of these I've purchased and am disappointed with the lack of edge on them. My four year old nippers of the exact same brand are sharper than these brand new. I would recommend buying something a bit higher end or returning them if you're not happy with the sharpness. I had mine for too long before use to do this so I have only myself to blame for dull nippers.
1,"Dull, Dull, Dull","I was anxious to put these new nippers to use as my old ones were badly chipped thanks to a friend using them to pull horseshoe nails. But I was very disappointed when I went to use the new ones from Diamond, who I thought had a good reputation for quality products. They were so dull they would hardly cut a hoof at all. I had to use all my strength to get one hoof trimmed. I finally went back to the old nippers, chips and all. They took about half the effort. I'm going to see if I can return these nippers."
3,Not a deep dive,"Buzz relies on its anecdotes and case studies to provide insight and explanation of the topic. The example-ware is interesting enough to keep the pages turning--the book's an easy read--but I was hoping for more. Using a diving analogy, if great business texts were scuba diving, Buzz would be snorkeling. While some of the material was thought-provoking, the text casually cruises around, and never really gets down below the surface.If you're looking to get an idea of post-Barnum, modern influence marketing, Buzz works. If you're looking for exhaustive analysis of the title material, descriptive techniques, or methods, this may not be the book for you.As an aside, there are repeated references to the authors' own company, which only detract from the work.A footnote: The book includes an entire chapter on and shock and negative marketing. By virtue of posting this review, I realize I'm contributing to Buzz' own buzz."
4,Timeless advice...,"I was surfing the WEB looking for some resources on Creating Demand for products and services when I came upon this book. I immediately bought it and began reading.There are steps to building demand for a product or service and creating the WOM (Word of mouth or ""buzz"") all marketers long for. By cleverly cultivating buzz, small businesses with small budgets can level the marketing playing field.IF you want to create excitement about your product or service or launch a new product, start with BUZZ!Heidi Richards, Founder & CEO - The WECAI Network(tm)""Helping Women Do Business on and off the WEB."""
5,chock-o-block full of insights,"This book is packed full of insights and case studies. Extremely readable. I found myself picking it up again and again, reading and re-reading various chapters. An excellent field guide as to how you can and others have tapped into the power of buzz. A must read for anyone involved in marketing. It should be added to every business school's reading list."
5,Right up there with I Am Sam,"For the Love of Aaron is a wonderful family movie about a talented, erratic mother trying to retain custody of her very poised, loving son against all odds. The mother has great supporting friends, and Aaron's love for her is inspiring. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes heartwarming, family movies without gore or nastiness."
3,For the love of Pete!,"As a guy who had a troubled mother, I found this movie interesting. The part of the troubled mom was played well. However, the part of the son, although well played in terms of acting, was far too idealistic. It was too nice. Too clean. A son who has such a troubled mother would be quite troubled himself. This was not shown correctly in this film. Also I thought the family origins of the mother's troubles were hit upon far too lightly. The film could have been greatly strengthened as a healing medium by a better analysis of the origins of her problem and how they worked themselves out through her life and into her own family structure."
1,For The Love of Aaron,"I did not like Meredith Baxter's acting in this movie. She did not seem to fit the part. Also, there was a monotone feeling throughout the movie. No rises and falls. It did not stir any feelings in me. I feel it should have been a more moving drama."
1,DO NOT RECOMEND,"I WORK AT A RENTAL COMPANY, WHERE WE IRON TABLELINENS FOR RENT. WE PURCHASED 3 OF THESE, AND SO FAR WE HAVE HAD TO SEND BACK 2 OF THEM AT LEAST TWICE. THEY QUIT HEATING,AND THEY LEAK WATER BADLY ON THE LINENS. I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS IRON FOR ANYTHING."
2,rowenta iron,This iron works well but is much too heavy for continuous use. I'm sorry I bought it and will certainly look for a much lighter iron next time.
3,Iron leaks all over clothes,I wanted a really good iron so after much investigation I decided to buy a Rowenta. It was very pricey but I figured that you get what you pay for. I must say that I am disappointed because every time I use the iron it leaks all over the item being ironed. If it didn't leak it would be a very good iron. I can't understand how Rowenta can make irons for so many years and not be able to make one that doesn't leak.
2,Power cord seems to be an engineering defect,"I have owned 2 Rowentas over the last 4 years and in both cases the power cords eventually shorted out within the housing of the iron. The latest cord failure resulted in blue flames shooting out of the rear of the iron. I detached the rear panel and discovered the rubber cord covering burned through aprox 1.5 inches before the 3 internal wires (1 white, 1 green, and 1 black)split off. I pulled back the outer covering and discovered the black wire had completely burned through. The white and green wires seem undamaged. I'm not sure but it looks like the wrong gauge of wire was used, thus resulting in over-heating. I'm not planning on buying another Rowenta as a result of my past experiences with this manuafacturer."
5,ROWENTA PROFESSIONAL - THE PERFECT IRON,Holds a lot of water which means you can iron more than one item before refilling. The steam is very powerful and always works and the steam burst is great for those hard wrinkles in thick items. Auto shut-off is a must for me. You don't have to press down to iron with this one. Self-cleaning is a great feature as well. I have gone through more irons in my life than I can count. This one will last a life time. I've had it over a year and expect it to last me the rest of my life. You get what you pay for!
5,bassically a genius,"marcus has proved time and time again why he is the master. from session player to top dog, nobody does it better. silver rain is pure brilliance. nothing marcus does ever disappoints. moonlight sonata is unbelievable. pick up any marcus miller project and thank me later. and if you really want your ass kicked, check out marcus with the late great miles davis. these two cats will hurt you. your head and your pets will never be the same."
5,The Power of Soul,"Marcus Miller's album Silver Rain is simply superb. The album showcases Marcus' skill with both the bass guitar and the bass clarinet. The album contains some bold covers: Edgar Winter's Frankenstein (featuring Kirk Whalum on sax), Stevie Wonder's ""Boogie on Reggae Woman"", Duke Ellington's ""Sophisticated Lady"", Luther Vandross' ""If Only For One Night"". Check out Marcus's surprising versions of Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata"" and Jimi Hendrix's ""Power of Soul"". The latter is outstanding. My personal favorties: La Vilette, featuring the vocals of Lalah Hathaway and Girls and Boys featuring Macy Gray. Give this album your undivided attention. You won't be disappointed."
5,Give the BASSMAN some.,"I didn't think that Marcus could top M2 album, but he did with Silver Rain. This album is excellent. Everytime I play it I hear something different. It is all about the bottom end people. What a musician."
4,bio media perfect for my diy canister filter,"I built a canister filter a few months ago, and purchased the fluval biomax to be the biological filter media for that stage of the filter. the filter is for a 20 gallon tank that my res turtle lives in. i test the water regularly, and this product seems to be doing a fine job."
3,Good enough,"Light works for a camping/tent light. Not exceptionally bright but enough for reading or finding stuff. The battery compartment opened oddly and the on/off switch is not difficult but when trying to turn the light off I opened the battery compartment instead. Yeah it was operator error but still oddly constructed. I like the light and its small and really light weight for backpacking and would be hard to break in a pack. Don't expect to scope the scene with it in the flashlight mode it's not that bright, but worth the $12 bucks"
4,Comfortable but ......,"This shoe is definitely comfortable to wear. If your job requires a lot of walking, standing, or a mixture of both, this should be one of the shoes you buy. I have been using mine for a month now and I am pleased to say that my feet feels ""happier"". I am a nurse in an ambulatory setting so my day requires walking and standing and since I got this shoe, I don't go home with sore feet any more. However, this shoe could improve on the aesthetics. My wife remarked that it looks like a work boot. I couldn't agree with her more."
5,Clarks Men's Touareg Oxford,"""Clarks"" makes a great shoe, that is why I bought these. Hesitated to buy them on-line, but they fit perfectly when I tried them on."
4,Durable and reasonably comfortable,so far this product is very durable and reasonably comfortable. It's a nice looking classy shoe without being too upscale
4,FANTASTIC,"gLAD TO HAVE THEM FINALLY, ALWAYS WANTED TO GET THESE AND JUST NEVER HAD MY SIZE ETC. LOOK GREAT, FEEL GREAT AND THEY GO WITH EVERYTHING. MOST OF ALL MY GIRLFRIEND LIKES THEM ! SHE HAS EXCELLENT TASTE, THAT IS WHY I LOVE HER!A. HARDAGE"
2,RECONSIDERING WITH CHANGE IN QUALITY,"I purchased my first pair of Clarks Touareg style shoes 2 years ago in a burnished brown color. I love those shoes. They fit great still and look good. I recently purchased a pair in black and am very disappointed. They do not fit snug. The mouth of the shoe is larger than my previous pair. They are about the same length however they feel too long and my feet slide out of the shoe. If I wear these I am sure to develop blisters and wear the heel of my socks. I'm in the process of returning these shoes and will not purchase them again. I would only consider them if I were able to try them on in a store first, despite that I have purchased them before in the same size. I will look for another shoe company after this experience. This is a let-down! Beware."
1,These shoes are not a bargin,"I bought these lovely shoes and was thrilled when they came in. They fit great and are very comfortable, but the first time I polished them the brown color came right off and I was left with freaky looking shoes that I can't wearWhat a rip off!. I would not advise any to purchase these shoes, unless you never plan to polish them. I hope I can have someone dye them for me."
1,"Gorgeous, but unfortunately not comfy at all.","I loved these shoes at first. They're very handsome, and well-made (true to Clarks history of high quality). Swapping the insole with my custom orthotics was extremely easy. However, I found there wasn't enough of a firm sole to support the orthotics. I teach, and after just a couple of hours of standing/walking, my feet ached tremendously. Unfortunately I had to return the shoes. I found they run true to size legth-wise, and were actually a tad wider than similar D-width shoes."
1,shoe,This is by far the worst item I have every purchased here. The day I received this pair of shoes I realized that it was ugly. I never used until after about a month of purchasing and the sole of the shoe came off in my hand while I am attempting to place it on my feet. Was an absolute waste of my money.
2,Doesn't Fit The Bed Very Well,These sheets do not fit my standard Cal King matress. The fitted sheet is not deep enough and the flat sheet is not nearly long enough to tuck in. I have other 400 TC sheets that are much softer than these.
2,"Too Much Talk, Not Enough Music","I love Cash and his songs on this CD are good, but there is way too much dialogue between the songs. I bought this CD so I could listen to Music, not the singers/band talking back and forth about what christmas is/was to them."
2,Love story.,This is observations of what we now call a voyeur of love stories and interactions of people of all ages and circumstances. Though it tries to be mysterious and dramatic it fails. You need to be patient to get through it. If you are looking for a read that will not hold your attention then this is the book for you.
5,Mas Flow 2,"Well this CD os the best Cd ever! Every song in the cd is good and i like all of them. Its the best CD for Reggaeton and for the reggaeton liseners it has daddy yankee, tego c., wisin y yandel, baby ranks, luny tunes, and other ones. the best songs ever are RAKATA, el tiburon, mirame pt.1 and pt.2, oh johnny, and mayor que yo.this cd is really good."
4,Best CD,"This CD has great songs especially for people who like to listen to reggaeton. Some of the best songs are el tiburon,rakata, and mirame."
4,they did it again,unbelievable!! Just when you thought that they were due for a flop--they hit us with this s**t. top to bottom one of the best compelation LP's to date--Every fan of the genre will enjoy this one--don't miss it.
4,Pleasant Surprise,"With such a whimsical title, I wasn't sure what to expect. Novelty act? Not at all! The music proved much more serious than the cover might suggest. It is very traditional, authentic, and satisfying throughout. The Klezmatics have a lot of talent, and a deep love and understanding of this musical tradition. This is an outstanding CD, definitely one of the best klezmer albums I've heard. I'd recommend it to any fan of the genre. This is the real deal. Shalom!"
3,White anchovies,I was concerned when the box arrived dented and the freeze packs were melted. It did not say on the jar if they needed refrigeration. I did use the anchovies and they were fine . I ordered them from Amazon because they are not available in our area and I needed them for a specific recipe.
1,Candy Shop = Bubblegum pop rap = G@Y,"Rap has reach to its end and changes into bubblegum Pop-Rap.. when these non-heter0sxual rappers like the D4L, 50 Cent rapping about candy (laffy taffy & candy shop)..whutz gonna be next? a rapper is gonna make a song about blowin bubblegum? or talk bout rockin skittle colored fitz & jerzeys? or matter of fact, rap about lollipops?... this has to stop.. if your gonna rap about candy.. make sure u say it right (candy = coke).. this pop-rap madness has to stop.. lmao ..Look at Fifty Cent..hes all hardcore.. gangster.. got shot nine times.. k!ll!n people, robbing them.. lmao @ this fake..hes trys to hard to be ""cute"" for the girls by makin this song.. but he failed.. hes all sayin Ja Rule went Pop..but look at him.. he went Pop with this G@y $h!t.. If ur a real hip hop listener.. avoid this at all costs... The only thing I like about this cd tho is the Disco Inferno beats.. other than that..the rest is certified GARBAGE"
1,"A Piece of Tarnished Trash,","Candy Shop/Disco Inferno No StarsThese are the worst songs I've ever seen in hip hop history, candy shop & disco inferno are so pathetic it makes me sad that these songs are good, 50 is the worst rapper in the history of hip hop (worse than 98% percent of the junk), sorry 50, but jada already got ya for good and the other song piggybank sucks too, I'll be glad once this trash goes off the airwaves in a few years and I Defintely lost my respect for cuban link when he said 50 and his crew are on top, they are on top alright, on top to ruin and destroy rap music.This is a piece of tarnish,incomprehensible trash."
5,go Fcuk yourself,i dont even fell like explaining my self but these are both really good songs. stop hating!!!!
1,WACK !!!,"First off I'm a serious hip hop head and like real rap like Wu_Tang clan, jeru the damaja, smif N wessun, gang starr etc. but i hate rappers like 50 cent who release bullsh-t songs like this and get all the credit and popularity. yeah the videos good, it would be better if 50 cent wasn't in it. Anyway the song has wack lyrics and is more annoying than 'In da club' which is WAAAACK. Don't support rappers like this cause if ya don't buy it, these wankstas would stop releasing them.Kray-Z187"
1,Horrible and Nasty,I am 10 years old. I heard this song because some of my friends were talking about it at school. I think it should not be available online for kids to download because it's not appropriate. The words are disgusting. Try listening to Dave Matthews or Green Day. You'll notice they don't have as inappropriate songs.
2,a ten year old kid,if u don't like what he say well dont listen too it and anyways your not old enough anyways let only understand what he's talking about you need to go take a nap youngsta.yo i think the song's alright but kinda boring.YOU KNOW
1,What the Crap?????,What the heck is this crap???? THIS obscene garbage made number one? There is NO justice in this world.
1,50 cent,"Ahhh remeber the days hip hop was great. A day when a person like 50 cent would not even be able to hold the mic at the party. But now hes the king of so called hip hop. With the release of the Candy Shop single, 50 cent has now lost respect from many of his hardcore fans. The lyrics are so awfull, so awfull that its strange that people actually like this. or do they. Or are radio stations so gassed off this guy that they drown us with this garbage, when they can easily play quality music from artist that matter and have something to say. ""CANDY SHOP"" is the worst song 50 has put out yet."
1,so obviously a one star item,"This is just more terrible rap from 50 Cent. His songs have awful rhythms and shouldn't ever have been played on the radio. I'd pretty much prefer that no rap go on the radio, but 50 Cent is just over the top awful. He has no skill whatsoever, his music is boring and oftentimes annoying, and the cover of his CD even is stupid. I assure you that this CD is not worth buying in the slightest, and if ever you find a copy of it lying around make sure to burn it and spread its ashes over a pile of slop. A word to 50 Cent: get a new job"
1,Worst Song of the Century,"This might well be the worst song of the 21st century, the beats are horrible, the lyrics are completely silly, the music video is really bad and 50 has zero talent, just all image, and he doesn't have any substance and there is zero chemistry between 5-0 and olivia.This song is a mess, a truly absolutly mess."
1,You guys dont know anything,"Why do you guys think that 50 cent shouldnt stick out? 50 is the most high paying rapper and with his new CD, The Massacre, 50 will have even more popularity all over the world.Also, about the whole dissing other rappers....he was only giving them a taste of their own medicine. 50 Cent obvisouly deserves to have a booming year."
1,I have to do this...,"""I'll take ya to the Candy Shop, I'll let ya lick the lollipop""For one thing, 50 Cent sucks.So do these two singles.Maybe that's why 50 Cent performs them.G-Unit sucks.Money doesn't.And that's what 50 Cent knows.He's using it to his advantage.Why does he go from being likable on ""Power of the Dollar"" to being a thugged out ladies man hypocrite on ""The Massacre""?Money my friend.It's all about the Benjamins.And you know what?50 got alot of it!The man's a genius. Oh yeah, that kiss with Game was very funny.Did I mention 50 Cent sucks? Yes? Has it gotten through to the million people who bought his record in the first week?No?Will it ever?*Sighs and shakes head* Doubt it...Did I mention these singles suck? And did I mention the snitch is a genius?"
5,Excellent!,"A very enjoyable, amusing read. I found it refreshing that the author never lost his sense of humor throughout what sounds like a very difficult year of training. Quite frankly, I found the book inspiring. It helps knowing that while you're training, there are others who undoubtedly have it worse (or perhaps better?). Aside from the martial arts perspective, I also thought it was a very interesting portrait of a foreigner's life in Japan."
4,Entertaining but not as good as,"Salzman's IRON AND SILK which it is similar to (as a previous reviewer has already noted.) The author details his life as a foreigner in Japan (some of the most interesting parts of the book for me) and his attempt to survive the Tokyo Riot Police course. I should add that martial artists will undoubtedly get more from the detailed descriptions of the training than I did. Despite only giving it 4 stars, I will say I tore through it in three days, so it definitely kept my attention."
3,Enjoyable reading but its not a book on Aikido or Japan,"I enjoyed the book and, as light entertainment, it is a good read. However, I found it over simplified the Japanese culture it tried to explain and while it did illustrate certain aspects of Japanese martial arts, these were often glossed over.As ""light reading"" Twigger-san has done a good job and if you buy the book to read his story you should not be disappointed. If, however, you are looking for an insight into aikido, the martial arts or Japan, you risk disappointment."
2,Lost in Japan,"This was an easy read, full of colourful characters and it held my attention although in the end I found it rather sad - pathetic even. It certainly did not make me want to take up Aikido and I didn't feel much in common with the author. Twigger is , I guess, a very clever guy but at the same time I feel that he is a bit of a thug and rather a wastrel. He may have learned Aikido but he didn't learn much Japanese or much about Japan - in fact I found the book curious: every other book on Japan which I have read written by a foreigner betrays the author's love for the country (even if that is laced with some fairly strong criticisms). Twigger betrays no such emotion - I got the impression that he took virtually nothing away from his time in the country. I thought that his descriptions of Japanese food, which he dismisses as horrible, reminiscent of the caricature of the English xenophobe and his other insights on Japanese society were not very insightful."
5,Keep in mind he's a poet,"I picked this book up in a library when I was mentally preparing for a trip to Japan. Starting with the subtitle ""A Scrawny Oxford Poet Takes Lessons from the Tokyo Riot Police"", I was hooked. There are plenty of martial arts books where the writer tries to show off what a great warrior he is, and plenty of instructional books. This is not one of them. It is a book about a poet who decides he needs to become a warrior to be a real man, and then actually goes out and does it. It's also an incredibly funny book about being a foreigner in Japan, and the every day struggles that go along with that.When I got to Japan, I found that the book had prepared me quite well for the kind of mental space to expect, and even the feelings that I was having as a foreigner.Aside from its utilitarian value, this is an incredibly enjoyable book which kept me up far past my bedtime. The quotes from the Hagakure which begin some of the chapters are quite a treat, too."
4,Aikido is not always gentle.,Eye-opening. What the Japanese police practice seems more like Aikijutsu. The author and his gaijin classmates really deserve kudos for having stuck it out for the entire course.
4,An Aikido Odessey!,"Robert Twigger's book, Angry white pajamas, takes a close look at his time in Japan attending the intense one year Aikido course given by the IYAF (International Yoshinkan Aikido Federation). Even though the course is supposed to be for the benefit of the Tokyo Riot Police, they usually accept a few foreigners every year to take part and spread the art.From the get go you'll notice that is more a memoir than anything else. Mr. Twigger's writing goes from being a puny english teacher in a strange land, to a tough accomplished martial artist who knows about pain and patience.All in all a very funny, insightful read. I would recommend this to anybody interested in travel or the martial arts. I would in particular recommend this to anybody practicing Aikido, (I do Yoshinkan as well) because of the books focus on his training."
5,Keeping my feet warm,The slippers are warm and well fitting..My only disappointment is that they are made in China..I honestly don't know that I would have paid the price had I known this in advance.
5,Best slippers!!,"Just received these to replace a previous pair from a different company. These are the most comfortable house slippers/shoes!! I wear them all around the house, in the yard, and a quick trip to the store. Love, Love, LOVE them!! Highly recommend. The slippers are made for comfort and durability and keep my feet cozy warm."
3,narrow at toe wide at heel,"Comfy and cushy, but they are a tad tight across the toe box (I have a narrow foot, A)and loose at the heel. Adequate for scuffing about. Not as good as my 15 yr old pair of shearlings that I want to replace. Delivery was prompt. Package in good condition."
5,My Fav slippers,I got these slippers from the shop downtown Santa Fe where I first tried them on and went back several times debateing the price.I have not been let down... these slippers are my most favorite ever... I get a new pair every year and highly advise the purchase ifyou are sitting on the fence.. take care of them and they will last all year. We have cold Mtn nights here and I wear them year round.Just take good care of them... they are not for running errends in the snow... get a size larger to let the shearling wear down and youwill love the fit... have fun..
5,Magnum Opus!,"Scofield""s swan song for Gramavision and the best of the lot! I bought this cd in 1989 and this music really hits the spot every time I put it on the stereo. The tunes are memorable, and John's playing is inspired by the two excellent drummers including Johnny Vidacovich, and Terri Lynn Carrington. With the exception of the late Don Grolnick playing organ on a few tracks, it's an extroverted trio affair with a big sound. Anthony Cox is on bass. If you're craving more of Sco's guitar, do yourself a favor and order this cd."
3,Nice,"Why is this the only Sylvers non-compilaton CD available? It is a good one. Mostly upbeat songs typical of the time period. Best being 'Come Back Lover"" and ""I'm Getting Over"" either one wouldn't of sounded out of place on a Shalamar or Whispers LP.""Just When I Thought It Was Over"" is a good ballad, once again evoking Shalamar. Even though the price on this is a bit steep, it's nice to have this again."
4,The Sylvers Concept...,"Although it's just the 'five' of them, the Sylvers 'sound' still manages to come through. Frankly, the harmony that the singing family had was the source of their magic! 'Concept' is a good R&B;/Dance compilation that takes me back in time with a mixture of Dance Tunes and several Ballads. The standouts on this disc:1. Come Back Lover2. Just When I Thought It Was Over3. ""P.S."" (The Unfinished Letter) [My absolute favorite on this disc!]4. Heart Repair ManI give this collection 4 stars!!"
4,"Not Gold, but Good","Twenty-four rhymes from Mother Goose selected by Robin Cohen and cheerfully illustrated by Nan Brooks: it opens with an eye-catching and fanciful illustration of the lady riding a large bonnet-wearing gander over a peaceful scene. Pictures with lots of color, many animals, quaint costumes and happy children are bustling with activity. Then the last page concludes peacefully with ""Bedtime"" and the well-known ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."""
4,excellent reference,"I am more than a bit late in reviewing this book. Photoshop CS is at least three versions old now, but I have not upgraded my software. Instead I decided to upgrade my knowledge! Wow! I have found much in this book to make me feel like I have a new version of the software. True, some of it is simple that I never before used, but it is new to me! You will hardly believe that in 5 years, I did not learn how to use the band aid tool! It is great. I hate to tell you what my work around was, but the band aid is MUCH better. I have learned a lot about the transform function and pen tool too and am still working on both of those. My only real complaint is the author's frequent attempts at humor. I like getting to know him, but most of the attempts are poor. I like the book and recommend it."
5,Rowenta DG5030 Pressure Iron and Steamer,"Having used a professional iron for many years with an automatic drip bottle, this was a big change for me. I liked the features and affordability. It does a nice job. What I don't like is that I run out of water for steam if I'm doing a lot of ironing, whether it is household items or sewing projects. Note that I think nothing of spending a few hours in my sewing room working on things and ironing laundry as well."
2,Why I will not purchase another rowenta or other brands under the Rowenta name,"I had a Rowenta Iron for 8 years and had no problems with it and I thought I knew the product so,I purchased my Rowenta steamer iron in May 2011 and it started leaking around the sides of the seam, I called Rowenta and they gave me the name and address of the place to ship it in LittleRock AK. It cost me $19.07 to ship it and the boiler had to be replaced clearly a manufacturer flaw since I had only used the iron 5 times since I got it.I emailed Rowenta and ask them to refund my shipping charges and they refused, they told me that the company did not reimburse shipping charges even when a product is still under warranty, it does have a year warranty on it and that does not mean anything. I followed the instruction booklet to the letter and still got a bad product. I guess you know this is the last Rowenta or any other brands under the Rowenta name I will purchase."
1,"DANGEROUS, USELESS, WORST IRON ONE CAN BUY","I never normally write reviews but my conscience tells me I must take the time to write this review to save others from the problems I face with this iron.The iron is dangerous and should not be on the market. It does not shut off, the water leaks, the heating is faulty, bad design, steam uncontrollable. It is an accident waiting to happen.I tried to call Rowenta a month after I got the product and they were not interested in helping or hearing my feedback. Terrible company.Please do not buy this product. You will waste your money and get burnt.CresRowenta DG5030 Pressure Iron and Steamer"
1,Rowenta Steam Iron Fizzles,"I bought this Rowenta because I had one previously that I was very pleased with, but its plastic case melted after three years of use. I quilt professionally, and need a good strong steam pressure iron, and thought the Rowenta would be worth the price. However, this one was not all that I hoped. It spit rather than steamed, much more than the previous iron had, and despite my following manufacturer's directions. Then I noticed that it had to be filled with water much more frequently than should have been necessary. Finally, it started just leaking water out of the bottom of the tank. My ironing board is soaked, and I'm afraid to try to use the iron because of possible electrical problems. Of course, it is too late for me to return it to Amazon."
1,Do not buy it!,"We purchased the second one and got the same problem after using it around 10 times. Steamer stopped working. When you call them, there is no way to fix it. Because we don't iron a lot, it passed its warranty so we won't buy another one. What a waste of money. The first one was a real investment, around $350.00. At least the price went down. I wonder when will they decide to take it off the market. I'm looking for a real one, like one you find in Europe. My sister has one for 10 years, used every week."
2,Very disappointed,"After doing without an iron for many years, I bought this iron on the strength of the Amazon reviews. But I've been extremely disappointed. The iron sputters all the time, you can't see how much water is left, it's scary to refill if you've used the iron recently (you have to make sure to expel all the steam). Moreover, the instructions are lousy.I mistakenly thought I was getting what I paid for, and I've never before paid for such an expensive iron."
1,rowenta steam iron problems,"I have had two Euro-Pro steam irons the past 15 years and wore them out with use. They were great. This Rowenta Pro Iron Steam Station spits out water continually while using the steam option. I have tried it with all combinations of heat(iron vs.boiler) with the same results, spitting water on the fabric.I should have returned it before throwing the carton away."
5,Great Steam Iron,I ordered one and it did not work. Sent it back . I despertly needed this type of iron for my childrens clothes business. The one I received is great. It does every thing I thought it would . Thanks. There is a few things you have to learn about it. Rowenta will send you a free cd
2,Just Okay,"Once you've used a steam generator iron, you'll never go back. This is my third one, but the Rowenta is surely not the best. No matter where the steam setting is set, it still tends to ""drip"". Quite annoying. The plastic guard on the cord is way to high and makes ironing uncomfortable on the wrist. I'd go back to my Black and Decker, but they discontinued the model. Darn it. In Europe, they make tons of brands (Tefal, Moulinex, Krups) but not for the American market. Come on manufacturers, lots of us love natural fabrics and we still iron! Give us some choices. But if you iron on a regular basis, you MUST use a steam generator iron. It will truly cut your ironing time in half. The reservoir holds three times as much water as a regular iron and the steam gets three times as hot so the sole plate doesn't have to be as hot...hence, no scorching. Your clothes end up looking like they were pressed by a dry cleaner. Really."
2,Fails after two years,My second DG5030 has just failed after two years. The first one just about made it to that. I have four children so the iron is on every day but even so i think it should have lasted a little longer.I read what everyone said about the spitting water. Both my irons had this problem and it is an issue that you cannot fix no matter how careful you are about what kind of water you use and how often you clean etc.I want to buy another iron but i am reluctant to buy another one of these - i will keep looking.
2,disappointed,Brought this iron to replace old Rowenta same iron they have changed some thingss on this iron BUT find this iron no matter the length of time I leave it on it splatters water and I am a designer clothing and other materials frustrated becaue the old one had 9 yrs with no problems this one spits water out when you press steam ...
2,"Not worth it, better to pay more for a better product, the seal cap broke in less than 6 oaths of use :(","I don't recommend this item, I try Rowena expert DG8030 before, was the most amazing product I have ever try, but unfortunately is discontinue. Now Highly recommend Rowena DG8430, amazing results with distilled water, and able to clean with accessories on the inside to avoid yellow stains :)"
4,Rowenta Pressure Iron and Steamer,As expected Rowenta products are always top drawer.The product is well made of quality product
1,so disappointed,"The first use of pro steam station was a disaster. The iron continued to ""spit"" constantly. After calling for suggestions and trying them, I was told the second time to send in for repairs. Exactly 2 months later, I received the iron back, only to have it do the same thing. This was my 4th Rowenta and to say the least, I am very saddened to have such a poor product this time."
1,Steam Iron,This is my second Iron - Had to return the first one - having same problems - as it leaks water out the bottom - at first I thought I might have overfilled it but I am sure now that I did not - I plan on returning this one and upgrading to the next model up
2,Wonderful Iron with a manufacturing Defect,"I have bought two of these irons in the past 5 months. The best iron I've ever used. I am an upholsterer and use it all the time, daily for heavy duty fabrics. After about 2 months, the boiler cracks at the seams and water starts to leak out, all over the table it's sitting on. I took the first one back and exchanged it for a new one, thinking it was just a defect on the single one I'd purchased. But the EXACT same thing happened. I just returned it with great sadness. When this is working, it performs beautifully. It's the right price. But I think because the tank is under pressure (part of what makes it a great streamer) is puts pressure on the seams, which are not well made. Ultimately it is the demise of the unit. Sad. Sad Sad."
5,steam station,I love the Rowenta steam station It almost makes ironing fun....almost. I only have to fill it once for most ironing sessions. Does a great job on my husbands chino pants. Would highly recommend it.
2,Two complaints with Model DG5030,"I replaced my old Rowenta (blue tank) with the new model and found it to be less than satisfactory due to: excessive water spotting on fabrics at any temperature/steam combination of settings and the fact that the water level in the tank is not visible; instruction booklet states that the water level might affect the spotting issues; however, if the water level is not visible, this is moot. I have contacted Rowenta who informed me they were ""aware"" of the spotting and water tank problems and that my comments would be ""duly noted."" Considering the cost of this iron and Rowenta's reputation for quality products, I feel that prospective customers should be aware of these problems before purchasing."
4,A professional iron indeed.,"I first purchased this Rowenta DG5030 professional iron sometimes in 2008. I used it everyday. My clothes always comes out looking very professionally ironed. The iron is very good. But after a while, the cover/valve leaks much water even after replacing the rubber responsible for preventing such an accident. This is very,very dangerous for those with small children and adults alike. I will recommend this iron for everybody but be very careful. Because of this reason, I recently purchased a replacement for my first Rowenta DG5030 professional iron when this problem becomes unbearable meaning, I can no longer leave the iron unattended any longer because when the water inside the iron boils, the steam will force itself out with water all over the place."
3,Quilter47,"I have owned Rowenta products for many years so when my old Steam Generator died I wanted another, however this one doesn't even compare to my older one. I am on my 3rd tank of water and the spitting and dripping hasn't stopped. It will drip water on the floor when I do a burst of steam and drip water all over when I'm pressing and want a burst of steam. I have contaced the Rowenta and they have given me suggestions to try and up to now they haven't worked. Seriouly considering returning this item and looking for another brand."
3,Disappointed with my second Pressure Iron & steamer,"I purchased my first Rowenta Iron and steamer over ten years ago and had to replace it because of the deteriorating steam hose. The new one is disappointing. It takes a lot longer to heat the water in the reservoir and the first sprays our of the iron are droplets of water rather than steam. I will continue to use the new iron, but found that this new model does not work as well as the first one."
2,it spits water like it's incontinent,this is no better than other conventional steam irons i have owned. it spits like a baseball pithcher. it does not make ironing any easier (i iron an average 3 to 4 hours a week) save your money buy a conventional iron.
2,3 years and its broken,I was very happy with my iron until the on/off button became increasingly less responsive and spongy to the touch until it stopped working altogether. The iron's base also became increasingly hot as the on/off button began to fail. I owned the iron for 2 or 3 years and I am disappointed it did not last longer then it did. I would not advise anyone to invest the $149 I did when I purchased it.
4,20 percent cheaper,"This item is the same price at Bed, Bath and Beyond. With 20% coupon which they send out all the time, it's a much better deal from there. Plus if you use certain credit cards you can get double the warranty, i.e. two years."
1,Poor product not reliable,We purchased the Rowenta DG 5030 and after 2 years of little use it would not create steam anymore. I called the service tech and he said it is a common problem and cost $100+ to fix. I checked online and many people have had the same problem. You would think that if you are paying $150-$170 you would get a decent iron. Some companies just produce garbage and I will never buy another Rowenta again.
1,Not so much...,"When the steamer was new, it was OK. The cord is plenty long and it produced a lot of steam.That's about all the nice things I can say about it.It takes a long time to heat up, so if you tend to iron just the things you need for the day, this probably isn't your best choice. Filling it up with water was a pain, they give you a fancy-looking funnel with a float built into it. It would indicate it was full about .2 seconds before water was running out of the filler hole when it was working at all. It spit water even after it was good and warmed up. Apparently, it was leaking water as evidenced by our wood floor. Finally, the power switch went out of it. It was still under warranty, so if I was willing to pay for shipping it to a repair center, they would have fixed it. However, it would only have the remainder of the original warranty on it.I opted to throw it in the trash and have ordered the Reliable Iron Maven."
1,rowenta dg5030,"Really disappointed in the product. Leaked from the first use, got progressively worse, I think it might be a safety hazzard due to the steam leaking out."
2,Don't expect perfection,"I purchased this iron when my old Rowenta finally quit working. I'm disappointed in the performance of this product, as it does not get hot enough or produce enough steam to get the wrinkles out of 100% cotton. It's great on today's cotton/spandex stuff, but for 100% cotton - forget it. The only good thing about it is I don't have to keep filling the tank all the time. However, I don't recommend this iron to anyone who is ironing the day to day stuff like school uniforms, cotton golf shorts, men's white dress shirts, etc. It takes too long to get hot, and it doesn't produce a constant stream of steam."
1,I cannot recommend this iron,"My rating is 0. I have had nothing but trouble with this iron. It leaks, there is no way to see where the water level is, it sputters and water splashes ruin my clothes. What a waste of money. Rowenta does not provide the quality one would expect with the cost of the irons. I am not going to buy another Rowenta iron until the quality improves. I wonder if manufacturers read customer comments. Apparently not - or they don't care."
3,Do not buy if you want family to use it,"I bought this iron/steamer after reading a wall street journal article saying it was great and would save money on dry cleaning. The article said it was the best in the u.s.and written by a woman. It was $155 on amazon, less than the $175 dollars amount in the article. I found the iron/steamer water holder to be dangerous. I went to open the holder to add more water, it could have burned me, the steam was scalding and could have sent me to the hospital if it touched me. The water holder is also terrible to empty. I would never have teenagers use it, it is way too dangerous. I would not buy this again. I am investing in a more portable steamer iron under 100. I waited too long to use it and I was too lazy to return it, it will stay in the closet for steaming wool suit. Invest in something the whole family can use. This product is way too dangerous to use for my teenagers."
1,Rowenta (with tank),"This iron had to be returned immediately as it constantly spit ""pink"" water onto the fabric. I have had a Rowenta (with tank) for over seven years and had been completely satisfied. Now after checking further, I find that Rowenta is not what it used to be - I will not be purchasing a Rowenta in the future."
4,Steam iron,"I like the Rowenta brand. A lot. This is a really good iron. My only negative to Rowenta company and not the seller is that the cord nearest to my hand ( when ironing), gets too warm. I'm sure they can improve on that flaw. Other than that a beautiful iron."
2,Died at 23 months,"Very disappointed with this iron. In April of 2008 I found this iron and thought I'd died and got to iron heaven. I loved how it steams. I paid $180 but last month it started steaming out from under the cap. Not just a little but so loud that I'm afraid it will blow the cap completely off. I wrote Rowenta and their solution was to buy a new iron! I couldn't believe what I was reading. So, this iron didn't last 2 years, cost a small fortune and you want me to buy another one?! Just know when you buy this iron it dies in a couple of years.JeanCrabtree, Oregon"
1,Worthless,"This iron is a piece of crap. I'm a very experienced seamstress who has used a Sussman gravity-feed iron for the last 20 years. It finally gave out and I decided to replace it with this Rowneta. When it's working, it adequate, but not outstanding. There's no way to tell how much water is in the reservoir - the funnel indicator quit working and when it's overfilled, it's a major problem. Of course you can't fill it while the system is hot, which is another pain.The Sussman showed you exactly how much water you have and you can refill any time. It's also much quieter than the Rowenta and produced more consistent steam.This iron is a complete waste of money. I can only assume the positive reviews are from users who've never used a superior system.I'm going to see if I can get my Sussman working again and trash the Rowenta."
2,rowenta pressure iron and steamer,"I am not satisfied with this iron. It spits water, not steam, at any temperature. There is no water level indicator and the hole to put the water into the tank is so small I have no way to know when to add water until it is empty and then it takes approx. 10 mintutes to heat again. The print on the temperature and steam settings is too small to see from an ironing position. I have had two Rowenta steam irons before this one and loved them. This one I tried to send back and counldn't. Their customer service is not interested in customer satisfaction to say the least."
1,DO NOT BUY,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. The iron has leaked since the day I first used it. I have tried all their suggestions on the proper water to use and nothing helps. I would strongly urge anyone wanting a steam station look for another brand.
1,OMG!! What a mess.,Have had four Rowenta steam irons. They are programed to crash after three or four years in order to keep the company in business. They worked well for their predetermined life and are worth the investment(not a life long one).This damned DG5030 is a piece of s...!~ Spits and stains on demand. Just pull the steam trigger twice!!Followed the directions to the letter!~ Ugggggg.Please note that Amazon requires at least one star. That is too generous.
2,product diisappointment,"The Rowenta DG5030 leaks water out on all clothing even though manufacturer guidelines are followed. Rowenta customer service states you must hold iron up high between each application for water in hose to run back into tank. If you place the iron back on the soleplate, it will leak water out each time you try to use it. We would really not recommend this iron or Rowenta's customer service."
5,BUY IT!!!,"If you don't enjoy spending a lot of time ironing, buy this product now!!! It will save you a ton of time! I am a shirt and tie at work guy, and I iron all of my casual clothes as well (as opposed to having everything dry-cleaned).This product has cut down my ironing time drastically - well worth the extra money.The ONLY drawback is that you have to wait about 10 minutes from the time you turn it on before it's ready to use."
5,Rowenta DG5030 iron,I bought this for my mother who is a professional seamstress. She's had several Rowenta irons and really likes them. This one was no different. It's definately worth the money!
4,Great Product,Worth the price...this is my 2nd one and I love it. It does spit for a few seconds when you first use it but it's not I problem if you don't place it on the clothing those first few seconds.
2,Was great - now a leaking sieve,"No longer works as before; leaks like a sieve through the plate so gets clothes soaking wet - Only worked for one year one monthPurchased in October 2009I am very happy with this product. It saves me a lot of time. On an occasional basis I will steam for an hour or so. I am steaming wool, so I love the light weight iron and I can use it for at least an hour without refilling.It's a little bit cumbersome regarding refilling it when it's already hot (or maybe I should read the directions further), but I have no complaints.I put the base on the floor and I have no water dripping ever.I hope it lasts longer than some of the other reviewers have experienced. I will be very disappointed if it doesn't last more than two years.[...]"
3,great iron,"I have this iron. It changes the how you deal with your fabrics, it's brilliant. My complaint is that is so high-pressure that it makes condensation on my ironing board and rust and all that. I just ordered an ironing board from the same manufacturer, it's all high scale and a prefab system, but understand when you buy this High quality product, and you have to have to also invest in the ironing board. Or you end up with a rusted, water vapor issue, walls included. It's great and some strong steam...!"
2,Rust - Be Careful when Ironing White Clothing,"I loved this iron when I first received it as a wedding gift in June 2007. It is now not quite 2 years old and I am afraid to iron anything white. Every time I iron now, it spurts brown stuff out of the iron all over my clothes. I am very disappointed."
2,Died young due to cheap parts...,"Wonderful when it works - but mine, like many others according to these reviews, died young. This iron costs way too much to die in three years of low to moderate use. I took it apart. The problem was a burned on/of switch. I by-passed it and replaced the cord. It works - but I think few people would do this, most would throw probably it away. There is no good excuse for using a cheap switch in a $160 iron. It's made in China. It seems to me that many of the great reviews come from people who have had the iron a short period of time. I give it a generous two stars."
1,Worst ever.,"I have owned a Rowenta Steam Station for 8 years and my husband fixed it a couple of times when little things went wrong. Great iron. So, with that great luck, when my iron finally quit, I only looked at one iron the Rowenta to replace it. Well, it wet everything I used it on. I do a lot of heirloom sewing and you can't have an iron wetting (soaking) the expensive lace and batiste fabric. So, I checked online and found that a lot of people had the same problem. What a shame, considering what a great name and product they used to have. I returned the iron to Amazon."
2,Rowanta steam irons,I have had two Rowanta irons in the past 15 years - different models ( this onw is DM 273) and each has failed within seven years or so. I woukd expect such a highly rated product to last longer.
1,Leaks like a sieve,"I bought this steam generator iron after a family member had a great experience with an earlier model. I followed all the directions carefully. It leaks water and spits water almost constantly. Rowenta customer service acknowledges the issue but has offered no solutions. This is a known problem with this model. I am out big bucks and will never purchase another Rowenta steam generator again. From what I was told by the Representative, this model is made in China. The newer models are made (again) in Germany and do not have the same issues."
1,Failed second use.,"No excuse for this. I have only used this twice and it seems like the iron shorted. It still throws steam but the iron sparked on second use and no longer working. You would expect an iron this price to last a little bit more than 2 uses. If you get to read this review, understand I am not angry, just rather extremely disappointed. I would advise you consider another iron. If you are like me, you would buy expensive stuff hoping it wont give you problems, specially if you take care of it... I don't event want this thing anymore, I honestly rather buy another one... not this brand, not this iron."
2,One Day It Worked--The Next It Didn't,I've owned my Rowenta DG5030 for 2 1/2 years. I've used it approximately a dozen times. It worked like a charm--that is until today when it wouldn't turn on. I called Rowenta and was told that I had to send it back to them via UPS in order for them to determine what was wrong with it and how much it would cost to fix. After reading other reviews that mentioned problems arising after 2-3 years of use I have to say I'm reluctant to go to the trouble. It would seem that Rowenta would like you to purchase a new steamer every three years.
5,Incredible Product,"This is the first presure iron & steamer I have owned. Previous I used aBernina Iron, which I really liked. At the recommendation of a friend, I purchased this iron and been very pleased with the results.Ironing has never been easier or looked so professional. If you get a crease....shoot a little steam and the crease disappears. The unit takes a little longer heat, if I get in a hurry the iron will spit water. I found holding the iron out and giving a couple of steam shots creates less spitting. For the price I do not think there is a better quality product."
5,Brilliant. the band that coined faux naivete.,"This album, indeed all ERQ albums but especially More Bad Times and It's All Good News, are chock-full of brilliant lyrics filled with whacked images. The music is great, upbeat and sometimes downbeat but always textured with interesting arrangements, great (if sometimes purposefully goofy) vocals and solos. One of their songs, Driving on 9, was later made famous by the Breeders (I think Carrie also played with the Breeders).The day Ed's stopped recording was a sad day for all of us."
5,The Best Ever,The curved claw is the only hammer my husband uses!!! This hammer is hard to find these days - so we bought 2. Perfectly balanced.
1,Very biased,This doctor is so concieted he thinks he is the only one who knows any thing about backs. Backs are made up of more than just the spine. Other problems can be present but he doesn't believe this. I would not recomend this book to anyone.
3,Teeny tiny one shoulder teddy,"This bear is very small. It's adorable and well made, but if your child wants to carry anything more than a few matchbox cars or transformers, you might want to go with a bigger bear back pack."
3,wrong colors,"im from rochester and it was great to see this hat here, i perform alot of music and people always ask me where i got it from. the only problem is that i would like the right colors (as advertised!) dont get me wrong, it came in an awesome all red with a black bill however i was expecting what i see in the picture(red bill with black all over)thanks though,i would be more than happy to plug the company since im doing alot of shows....im a big fan of these hats, there huge in my culturethanks!!!"
1,Disappointed,After paying $75.00 you would think they would be a good quality no support worn out very fast. Very disappointed
2,Gold Little Girl Italian Charm,I had hoped and expected something closer to the Zoppini Little Girl charm since we had a Little Boy charm from them and were trying to match it. This charm is a little more rough and raised (not as refined to me) than what we expected.
1,Not what I ordered,I did not get and what I ordered and Amazon and supplier keep ignoring my emails and complaints. As the reviews say you do.
5,Essential Collection Item,I purchased the Requiem CD after hearing one of the selections on NPR and enjoy every selection on the disc.
3,"Hey, where's the errata!","This is a pretty good book, very straight forward with examples that are related to the exercises. Great way to learn this stuff! But, there are many mistakes in this book. There is no errata available, even though this is the sixth edition! It would be helpful to have an errata, especially if you're doing self-study."
2,Kind of a tough read.,"Hard to follow along on this one. It's full of information about the Ho Chi Minh Trail but it is basically information, not anything to really get involved in. It was a chore to work through this book."
3,What a great book till....,"Reading Blue Angel was an incredible pleasure. This is the first Prose book I've read and the story-telling was so wonderful. I loved the characters and really couldn't put it down. It was funny and insightful, just a pleasure. However, the ending was a little disappointing. Everything leading up was excellent! It just seemed like she got tired and wanted to close up shop. It left me wanting more and wanting to know why? and how? and I felt kind of disappointed at how life turns out. I guess the ending was very real and I'd prefer the fantasy. If the ending was a little different, it would easily be 4 or 5 stars. All in all though, even with the ending, reading the books was great and definitely pick it up!"
4,Be Careful What You Wish For,"Francine Prose does a masterful job of depicting the inner workings of the mind of a middle-aged, frustrated writer/teacher. Swenson is so stunned and possibly jealous of Angela's novel in progress that he is irresistably drawn to the pierced, dark young girl. I was impressed by how much Swenson's thoughts and reactions to his obsession reflected how middle aged men (like me) think and fret, yearn and fear. I'm a teacher, and I know how the protagonist could feel himself slipping closer to the forbidden despite being aware of the snares that awited him and the taboos against his desire. The characters were funny, pathetic, intriguing, and infuriating. While presenting these wonderful characters, Prose also takes insightful swipes at the vageries of the U.S. college world. I highly recommend this book to others."
2,unintentionally entertaining,"In this novel, about a professor of creative writing, the author exhibits every example of bad writing that she is trying to satire. Her characters are comprise a cardboard collection of cliched details. They are unsympathetic and the reader could care less about their fates. She uses ""yeasty smell"" twice in 15 pages. The plot is predictable. What else? The funniest part is when Prose attempts to show us the ""brilliant writing"" of Anglea Argo. If you want to read a REALLY funny and beautifully written send-up of the academic world, read Nabokov's Pnin. If you want to see a wonderful example of writings within a novel, read Byatt's Possession."
2,Urghhhhhhhhh...,"This book was an annoying novel about an over-obsessive, sex-hungry professor who was easily munipulated by a student. The character 'Ted' was one that did not have any control over his emotions whatsoever, and ended up having much hell to pay in the meantime. I usually like to try to keep a generally positive attitude towards new books, but this one was simply just a blowout, and there is little more to be said. The one positive thing that I can think to say about this book (and there are few) was that the author sucessfully pursuaded me to like Ted and take his side throught the writing: the book could also have worked the other way with a lot more ease: have Angela as the victim, Ted as the evil perpitrator with a messed-up mind... The whole book just seemed to be a way for the author to get all of her sex emotions out onto paper, and I sincerely think that this book was one that should never be published."
2,Where's the beef?,"I'm sorry. I thought the premise of this novel would be entertaining, satirical, and worth the price of the book. It was anything but. This is NOT a ""smart bomb attack on academic hypocrisy and cant"" as the book jacket endorsement states. This is a B-52 cluster bomb drop on the usual attitides about men from those who wish to portray them as befuddled, confused creatures who could perhaps survive in this world if they weren't being constantly outsmarted and dominated by the superior sex. I was more than disappointed by the book after being drawn in to purchasing it buy the commercial hype that we find on this site. I think the reader's comments here, for the most part, are a more accurate portrayal of what awaits."
1,What the #$%^!,Why on earth did Ms. Prose bother to publish a book obviously ghost-written at the end? Did she hand it over to a student? Arg. Read endings BEFORE you read beginnings to know if they are worthy of your time to get there!
2,Blue Angel,"I agreed with Laura Clawson who also rated this book with 2 stars. I did NOT find this book ""blisteringly funny"" or ""deliciously risque"" as purported on the back cover. In the end, this book leaves you with a dismal feeling about most of the characters and an unexplained, unfinished plot. In addition, the subject matter, I must say, is not pleasant."
1,mundane and sloppy,"This novel is just too ordinary. Political correctness is an old topic and the author doesn't do anything new or special with it. The writing is very careless, and the characters are easy and seem to get easier as the storyline progresses. The storyline isn't much---young girl manipulates poor helpless middle-aged married professor---and by the end of the book the whole plot has collapsed into tedious nonsense."
1,Even a satire must have depth,"Even a satire needs characters with whom the reader can become involved and sympathize. Unfortunately, no realistic, or sympathetic characters exist in Blue Angel. Even Sherrie, the main character's wife, is so loosely drawn that you don't care if her husband cheats on her. Also, there is no moment in the book where you ""get"" that she has suspected him all along. And frankly, the subject of sexual harassment is too important and too sensitive to be satirized in such a pathetic fashion. I didn't even finish this book. I just put it down, thankfully, in a dusty and far removed corner of my at-home library."
2,Student teacher crush gone bad.,"And I mean bad. I wanted to like it, but there were too many problems with the story and too many unanswered questions -- there were even a few typos in the book! While there were some good parts, they were far and few between. This story does not make the grade."
3,"Funny and Well Written, Awful Ending","So I pretty much agree with what people have said here. I love the first portion of the novel (as a creative writing graduate student I found the workshop scenes hilarious - laugh out loud funny, though someone who hasn't been there may not be as amused). However, the end is ridiculous! The main characters thinks all of these things in his head, things that he should SAY out loud to others, but then doesn't. I hate cowardly characters. Plus, we never find out anyone's motives. It's really frustrating.This book would be significantly improved with one simple sentence: acknowledgment that the main character was going to write a memoir about everything (as suggested earlier in the book). But instead everything just falls flat, and the story reads more like a novel of morality than human condition."
2,The humor escaped us!,"I hated this book and was bit relieved when my book club gave it a thumbs down. The main character was a despicable human being, basically an ego-centric, second rate writer who lets himself be totally manipulated by a student. The portrait of political correctness on campus was funny indeed--but his totally asinine behavior robbed the ""trial"" scenes of any impact. This may sound far-fetched, but this book replicated the beginning of ""Disgrace"" by Coetzee--but of course that was a book that had something to say, and the academic angle was merely a springboard to a very different story. You can pass on this one."
2,Physically ill to the bitter end,"I will hate this wonderfully well written book. The whole thing was depressing from the author's description of parents walking with their sons and daughters across the quad on Parents' Day to the horribly twisted relationship between Swanson and his wife, Swanson and his daughter and, oh Lord, Swanson and that...sophomore, Angela. She sounds like a disgusting person and yet Swanson is so amazed by her writing talent that he actually developes a crush on her! This horribly gross girl who dyes her hair ugly colors and paints her face with make up. She's got metal all over her pierced face and somehow he finds that attractive. I wanted to vomit more than once.Despite the fact that I was disgusted through this whole book, I had to give it two stars because the satire and the writing is just so good. If you're reading it for writing style, then by all means enjoy. If you're reading it just for liesure..., put it back on the shelf."
2,started good but ...,"I liked the way the book began ... I was intrigued from the first few paragraphs. However, the more I read, and the more I could predict the outcome, the less I liked the novel. The first half of the book was very good.... it went downhill from there. The ending was expected, and boring."
5,"Funny, powerful, disturbing, beautifully written","A compelling read, at times hilarious, at other times unsettling. I knew nothing about Francine Prose until I came across this book and now I want to read more of her work. The prose reads effortlessly, the arguments are incisive. I know quite well the worlds of which she writes and she has brought them to life with a powerful mixture of satire and compassion. I highly recommend this book."
5,OK. So I'd give it 4 and one-half stars if I could...,"This book reminded me why I enjoy reading. It's subject matter is bleak, depressing, and yet, despite the beautiful satire of it all, a sly, confused picture of humanity peaks through. Is it funny? Yes, but you have to be willing to laugh at oneself and at those one wishes to admire. The pretenses are laid bare here. Since that's the point of satire, one has to consider this a successful outing for Prose.The truth is, I would never have purchased this book after reading a review of it, or even after hearing recommendations of friends. No. I read the book because David Sedaris recommended it last Spring, and because Francine Prose will be in town in a couple weeks, and I have a ticket for her reading but hadn't read any of her work. I opened this book with dread. It was a chore. Something I had to do. And then, suddenly, I realized that I was in the middle of a wonderful, wry, addicting treat.No, the eggs are not rotten. The omelet is fabulous."
1,Spare yourself,"This book sounded interesting from its premise, but turned out to be absolute garbage. The characters are stereotypical and thoroughly unlikable. The story also becomes fairly outlandish after the first few chapters. Prose doesn't take the time to establish a plausible story and that is what ultimately leads to this book's downfall."
1,Why is this book getting so much praise?,"I totally agree with the Reader from Newton, MA in her scathing review of August 11, 2000. (Please read it! She says everything I was going to say.) The satire might be biting, but the characters are unlikely as well as unlikeable, the plot thin and unbelievable. The girl Angela is so repulsive it's impossible to believe even a professor as stupid as that one would fall for her, especially since he was ""happily married."" All in all, this book is another one of those too-many-being-published-all-the-time TREE WASTERS. Makes one wonder why this author is so ""acclaimed."""
3,mockery,"Francine Prose is a satirist, it's true, but after I read this book and then after I noticed Scott Spencer's cover blurb, which called it a ""compassionate"" novel, I found myself wondering what the point was. Everyone, everyone, everyone in this novel exists to be mocked. Compassionate, that ain't. I'll happily admit that it can be fun to poke fun at people, at their foibles, at their all-too-humanness, at their peculiar institutions; but in the end the novel isn't fun at all. It's depressing and dull, like listening to an intellectual snob drone on about how stupid everyone else is."
3,Ordinary,"Rather a disappointment. Contrived in parts - a few good lines and observations, but the central character seems more of a type than a real person. A better account of the misadventures of a hapless middle-aged writing teacher is Straight Man by Richard Russo."
5,Like life only livelier,"""The Blue Angel"" is a smart, sexy, shrewd book that no only upsets our notions of political correctness but also upsets our notions of fair play and justice--like life. A wonderful engrossing read. Bravo Francine!"
3,Light reading,"Blue Angel is a easy, light book to read. From the beginning of the book you can predict many of the outcomes of the end. That being said, for the majority of the book you do not mind this because the ride is so entertaining. The characters are well developed. Where the book lacks is in its ending. The reader is left without a wonderful conclusion. There is either a sense that the ending takes an odd tun or does not take you to its true conclusion which is where does the lead character go from here. Regardless, it was enjoyable if you are looking for a light-hearted book."
4,Terribly facinating,"Reading Blue Angel is like watching a train speeding down the track, gathering dangerous speed, and being both certain that the outcome will be something awful, and at the same time not being able to look away. I completely enjoyed this novel, couldn't put it down. The story of a writing professor who succumbs to the seduction of a punk student's writing is both funny and pitiful. I would gladly have given the book 5 stars if only the main character's(Ted) motivation for being so spacey had been made clear. It's as if he doesn't see his own life happening before his very eyes. Why is this? Did I miss something? In spite of this perplexing oversight, I loved this book and hightly recommend it to anyone who thinks their life is boring or slightly out of control or just wants a great read without a pat plotline."
4,Treachery that frees,"This book is wise, sly, witty, and enormously entertaining. It is both a cautionary tale and a satire, both a tragedy and a comedy. The ending, which another reviewer did not like, is left to the reader's imagination and I thought it was boffo. The stage was set for the antagonists each to be redeemed, which is why I liked it so much. The author's writing skills are enviable, her turns of phrase are most amusing, that is, except for the bits which make your hair stand on end! Highly recommended to sophisticated readers interested in how people deal with messy life events of their own making."
4,Glad to see acedemia exposed.,"As one who finds some teachers arrogant and self-absorbed, I enjoyed reading Prose's satire on this segment of the population. It seems likely that professors like Swenson and his creative writing students aren't very far fetched. These people take their lives a little too seriously. Although this book was a quick and relatively entertaining read, I couldn't fully relate to this protagonist."
2,Who are these people?,"This book is a good read. It has forbiden sex and suspense. But it has it's flaws. The protagonist, Ted Swenson is a creative writing professor at a small New England college. One of his criteria for good writing is that the characters have to be believable. It is interesting to apply his principles to the novel itself. Swenson comes off as quite believable, but his nemisis, Angela Argo is not. Her destructive actions have no conceivable motive. She is too clever and her timing is too acurate to suppose that she is psychotic. Likewise, the campus atmosphere is not like anything I have ever seen(for example, the English Department party), and while sex between faculty and students has become no-no, the description of the faculty meeting on this subject is an unbelievable exageration of the PC attitudes that prevail. What saves the book is the portrayal of Swenson. I have met him - many of him. And there are parts of himin every middleaged man."
3,"good writing, not a great story","I was surprised to hear all the buzz and recognition that this title is still getting. David Sedaris raved about it during his recent book tour. To each, his own. Sure, the writing is executed quite ably. What fails here is the art of storytelling...in a word, predicatable. No epiphanies here. Reading this book was as frustrating as watching one of those primetime news show stories that you know are geared to manipulate you. Like those, this left me with a feeling of ambivalence. If you're determined to read this, save your money and wait for the paperback edition or for a used copy to surface in your local 2nd hand bookstore."
4,Engaging light read,"I liked this book a lot. I thought a lot of its strength came from Prose's ability to make us feel sorry for the main character, despite scolding his stupid actions throughout the book. How could Swenson be so dumb? I liked a lot of the dialog too.I can understand people's problems with the book ""answering questions nobody asked because everyone knew the answer already"". Its still a quick, engaging read. Worth the $2 at the very least."
3,Hot for teacher?,"This book was such a mixed bag.The premise is interesting. A creative writing professor (Swenson) becomes infatuated with one of his students (Angela). He's not interested in her because she's beautiful--she's a fidgety little punk--no, he's drawn to her because he admires the sample chapters of her novel. We then watch Swenson make a series of bad decisions, especially in the politically correct environment of his college, that spiral his life out of control. Interesting.But ultimately, I didn't think the book went anywhere. It's not especially funny, nor did I find it tragic because I really didn't respect Swenson or the decisions he made. Nevertheless, it held my interest until the end, and I do intend to check out some of Francine Prose's other, um, prose."
2,Blue Ending,"Up until the last two chapters, I experienced the book as a slyly hysterical, mocking story under the sure hand of a woman of exceptional wit and observation. Then the story suddenly turned into a grimly obvious tale fatalistically propounding some blandly literal but morally obscure stance. The ending was tonally false. What a turn-around! I feel like a writing teacher seduced into thinking the author had some real talent only to have my judgment completely bashed at final exam time. Weird feeling."
2,Phooey!,"The only reason why I gave this book two stars is this: if the plot is meant to tick you off with its story about sexual harassment at colleges and the inevitable downfall of a male professor who succumbs to an unlikely Lolita, then it's a success and deserves the two stars. If that was purely accidental, and the author thought that the obvious plot and stilted dialogue was a winner, then I give it one star. There is not one sympathetic character is this novel. The professor is a numbskull (because if he can't see what's coming, then he's ...) his wife is boring and the seductress-student is a plain old crumb--not clever, just lucky that she found someone dumb enough to seduce. I read it cover to cover, hoping for a suprise ending. Suprise! It stinks all the way to the end!"
2,"No, no, no","I usually write reviews only for books I really like as I read only the books I like --I dont' have time for the others, which I can usually tell aren't worth my time by the book jackets (no, I don't go by reviews, etc.) ""Fraught with"" is a sure-fire phrase to keep me away. I thought I would like this novel --but I didn't. And it wasn't the author's way with characters, which is very good --it was the plot, which didn't make sense. (Maybe I am too old), which is a failing in a reviewer. And it isn't that this novel is truly bad, a la Danielle Steele, etc. But it is very disappointing. The story just didn't hang together. I agree with reviewer DeBacker who said that a much better accout of collegiate life is found in Richard Russo's ""Straight Story""."
1,"As awful as the cover ""art"" would seem to indicate","The mechanics were serviceable, and the atmosphere not bad (though the dated graphics didn't help).The problem with this game is that after a couple levels you've killed the same zombie-with-a-broomstick and scary-nurse-with-huge-breasts A HUNDRED TIMES.If there had been a bit more variety, I might have made it further, but it's just such a dud. It really makes you think ""I have better things to do than this."""
3,so so russian first person shooter,"playable , nothing fantastic , something to play in between big titles, not worth more than 5- 6 bucks new"
3,You Are Empty,"Just started playing this game on a Windows XP platform. Its a typical XP style game, FPS, with some fun episodes. It allows you to save frequently which is great. The story is silly so far, as you are an escapee from a Russian mental hospital and are killing zombie nurses, patients and giant chickens. Graphics are pretty good for the genre. Buy it if you still have a Win XP PC as its entertaining."
2,You Are Empty,Game is a standard shoot and kill...No really challenge...Graphics are ok...Maybe could be used as a stress reliever
5,But you ARE empty!!!,"Yes you are empty very quickly, there are so many monsters around the corner you need to find some ammo fast."
2,Not too good,"This game has lots of problems. First of all it doesn't explain very well what's going on - note I don't have the manual because I bought it as a download (legal as the site I downloaded from was promoted on the official site for the game.) Things move very slowly - and a lot of the game is finding your way around rather than action - which is boring. The graphics also don't render very well - you can see right through the floor many places. The cutscenes also make no sense. A good idea and some fun, but they should have spent more time making sure things work right and on the translation for the US market."
1,Makes a spiffy boat anchor,"I purchased this computer in June 2005. It has been in the shop five weeks out of the five months that it's been in my possession. Each time I've taken it in for repairs, it has been for the same reason- faulty logic board. The first occurrence was a week after it's arrival from Amazon.I've checked on the web and have found that I am not the only person experiencing this problem. Also, the school I attend has a Mac lab with four iMac G5's, and two are broken due to logic boards.I have tried several times to get Apple to replace my computer, but all they want to do is replace the logic board. At the time of this review I'm in the middle of midterms and I don't have access to my crucial files.This is not a well-designed computer and you are taking a risk purchasing it. You may find yourself stuck with an $1500 boat anchor."
4,iMac Takes a Step Back from Predecessor,"This is, like most Apple equipment, a superb aesthetic design. Its functionality does not quite match its form, however. The prior generation of iMacs offered a floating screen that permitted an unfettered array of adjustments. This new iMac does not have the same range of ajustments and is downgraded slightly in my opinion. The components, processor, and the fact that all of the peripherals and connection are located in the screen adds to the aesthetic, but it is not as innovative as the iMac with the floating screen. The current design seems to mimic an earlier Gateway PC that was quite similar in design.I would probably rate this as 4 1/2 starts if such a rating were available."
1,iMac G5 is unreliable,"Do not buy an iMac G5 unless you get the AppleCare protection plan, do backups often, can live with downtime and have lots of time on your hands. My iMac is only 9 months old and I have had to replace the motherboard twice and the power supply once. The disk had to be repaired twice and reformatted once (this took over 4 hours to reinstall OS and recover files). Also keep in mind the AppleCare protection plan only covers hardware, not software/drivers, even if they come from Apple."
3,Nice looking but NOT Truely Compatible,"Let me start with I love the way it looks BUT for my job I need Internet Explorer and this is not compatible. I called because my sales person said it was and I was told it is not by an Apple rep. So I need a second computer to do all my work. Also if you want to type something in the word processor it has and email it to a client or boss you have to buy the Microsoft Office which is MORE money out of your pocket. So although this is nice to look at, it has a HUGE learning curve if you are a PC person like me. I will keep the computer since my husband got it for me for Christmas and he wont let me return it but I would have been much happier with a PC that would have cost less. Also this is not compatible with all web sites. I went on Gap.com and they do not recognize anything but Internet Explorer and that was just the first of I am sure many sites I can not get into. I have had this for 3 days now and feel this was not the best choice."
3,Let's not go overboard,"I am a long time Apple user who just switched over to a HP and I do not regret it. I had the PPC since 2005, and while it was a nice computer, it is not substantially better than PCs in its price range. Once you get past the flashy graphics, it is basically just another computer, and Apple fanatics really should hold the company to a much higher standard than they do in these reviews. The disastrous slot-load DVD drive is worth deducting a star alone. Applecare is not particularly great (unless you like heavy-handed bureaucratic phone calls), and god forbid a problem occurs after three years.I don't ""dis-recommend"" the PPC G5 -- I've had one for four years-- but it is hardly a five-star machine. It does the task, and if you like the Apple look, it is probably for you. However, the ""Cult of Mac"" fawning over this computer is a bit sickening, and highly misleading."
5,5 stars,"5 STARSSo far everything has been really easy to use for a new MAC user like me. I'm especially enjoying the fact that my desk is free of the extra equiptment that it takes to run a PC. I look forward to the many ways of using the MAC that I have still to learn. I thank my neighbor for the introduction to this computer.K. AnselmoCarmichael, CA"
5,Different. But Very Good.,"I bought this book because it was just a dollar on a clearance shelf, and I am very glad I did. I read it in one day, highlighter in hand.The author talks about having a high SQ instead of just an IQ. The SQ is a person's ability to see things spiritually (Spiritual Quotient). He is obviously good with science, and his love for science has only heightened his love for God, not turned him away from it.One of my biggest frustrations is the notion that science is for the smart and faith is for the weak. Guillen easily destroys that notion is this page-turning book."
5,A Must Have,"My wife, daughter, and myself have been training for only 3 months or so...This book has been invaluable as a reference to what we are currently learning. The drawings and explanations when coupled w/ even our limited background make things very clear...Great book."
5,Ideal for the beginner,"As a beginner of aikido, I am sometimes at a loss at remembering everything from the recent class. This book gives a good insight into aikido and has brilliant illustrations to aid the novice with technique.A MUST HAVE FOR ANY BEGINNER"
5,Best Aikido book out there,This book covers all the basics of aikido. It has very useful information by showing the ideas behind the moves. With outstanding illustrations together it digs to the core of aikido.
5,detailed and well written.,"Aikido and the dynamic sphere is very detailed in its descriptions of every aspect of aikido and also offers many various illustrations to aid in understanding the full idea of each topic. Easy to read and useful in any aikido Endeavour.If you are studying Aikido, this is a must buy.."
2,Cannot use with bed,"I purchased this for my mom who recently had a stroke. She was in bed at the time, quite a bit, and I wanted her to be able to use her iPad. This seemed like the perfect solution. Unfortunately, there is not enough room between the pole and the bed for it to slide up under the bed. It only slides enough for about 1/4 of the table top to go over the bed. We are using it for our binders that we keep her daily care info in... However, this was quite a disappointment. Maybe it will work better with a chair.. Will try and update later."
2,I wouldnt buy again...,"I would have returned this product if I didnt spend so much time and effort putting it together, THEN finding out that one of the metal pieces was bent. My husband had to put a shim in there to make the stationary side level. It doesn't roll too well and is rickety. Worth half what I paid..."
1,Broken on arrival,I had been looking for something to use on weekends to keep me out of my home office. I had seen these at various retailers and kick myself now for not buying local.This arrived with a crack with made it unstable - not to looks but weight distribution.Returned immediately.
4,Decent price and decent table,"As many others have mentioned, this table (at least mine) tends to be very wobbly. Clearly the legs are not level because it is equally wobbly wherever I have it. It is also a tad too high for couch and easy chair sitting. The quality is good, and it was easy to put together. I'm glad I have it, and i will use it for a long time, but I wish it was a bit more stable."
4,"Good, but not great!","We selected this product because it was the highest one found and that was important for the use. It is a little wobbly, but it is not effecting our use. Using it to hold a laptop and projector. Putting weight on it does seem to keep it a bit more stable. Was worth the money."
3,It's decent,"Just purchased this for my wife and her new laptop. Assembly was simple, nothing difficult. Had one of the plastic pieces crack when screwing the metal screw into it, but it was the center one, so the outer 2 seem to hold it together fine.Overall, I think it's a little wobbly. The fit with the vertical tube for the height adjustment is a little loose. What is needed is like a think plastic sleeve and I think if it was tighter there it would be a lot nicer. She hasn't really used it yet, so time will tell if the hand knobs you tighten will be enough to keep the trays in place.I think for the price it is decent. If you want something really solid, etc, plan to spend 2x or more."
1,$57 for ONE POUND incuding shipping,WHAT A DUMBA$$ I AM!! they don't put the weight in the add and I figured it had to be a five pound bag for the price.Boy did I get taken!!!! Geuss I should send it back for a refund and it took like 10 days to get it. Seems like for that much money someone would show up and offer to pleasure you within 24 hours with the coffee.
1,Overrated,"All of the positive, 5 star even, reviews of this coffee must be a plant. I purchased 2 pounds and found it undrinkable. It's amazing how people will decide a product is fantastic with a little strategic marketing. I've seen a group of 10 people taste a ""wine"" and were told this incredible story about it and how highly regarded it is in wine circles. 8 out of 10 of those people LOVED it. It was cheap cooking sherry, Worcestershire sauce and apple cider vinegar. This coffee is an example of this form of brainwashing. Buyer beware.."
4,"delicious, affordable espresso","great tasting mid-range coffee that made very smooth espresso. came in an airtight bag with a one-way valve which helped the coffee keep its beautiful aroma and flavor well over a week. brewed light, nutty and relatively sweet, although it was fairly easy to pull too slow and overpower the delicate flavor with bitterness. very dry beans which are great for my burr grinder and home machine with a non-pressurized portafilter.pros - tasty coffee for a relatively affordable price. dry, well roasted beans; good for your grinder and espresso machine. well packaged; one-way valve on the bag is a plus.cons - I was expecting a solid medium roast from the description, but the coffee is medium-light at most. flavor is delicate and overpowered in milk-heavy drinks, and can easily be ruined when brewed improperly. Never produced a lot of crema, and existing crema was light in color and thin."
3,good quality good exercise,"Ill be honest, i havent seen results cause i havent exercise continusly, i can say its a really good quality item but, why cant they make a new instructional video and add some more explicit info about a routine of work? The explanation cd its REALLY LAME, its like from de 80's."
3,Great shoes and service but results will take longer,Excellent service. Good product but the results of using appear to take longer than expected. Probably going to sell them.
5,GREAT PRODUCT.,"Item works very well. Makes jars much easier to open. Can also use it to close. Works on metal lids and even better on plastic ones. Note that it will mar the lid edges because of the gripping teeth. If you use it a lot on a given lid, the lid may get scratched & gouged. Well made of heavy-gauge steel."
4,I might be an idiot,"I don't know much about tools but my boyfriend asked for a new Plumb hammer for Christmas with a straight back, not curved. I saw this, ordered it, wrapped it. When he opened it he told me it was a brick/stone hammer. You can't tell by the side view photo but the whole top is solid and it's a very heavy hammer. So maybe the description could be a little more descriptive, or maybe I could know a bit more about tools. Either way it seems like a good quality product, and if my man is asking for Plumb, it's for a good reason he's been a carpenter for a long time."
1,very misleading,"i may not be the right person to judge this book,i have just developed the new found fascination to read books of varied interests, nothing personal about what am writing,i was quite found of Mr.Pradeep magazine during my younger days,but to put it point blank this book of his sucks,i would like to go a step further and say the money i had spent on this book went to a fruitless cause and would recommend others not the buy this book on account of its title as it is really misleading,you will not find anything substantial about the match-fixing allegation,all that our renowed editor of a far more renowed newspaper does is to carry from where he left his last column for a daily,write a few columns,a few anecdotes,a few interviews,i would even like to say he wrote everything but about the match-faxing and i am very dissapointed by this book,a waste of money,waste of time"
4,"Classic cartoon, for better or worse","Not much too say. The soundtrack was an awesome rock mix, the story wasn't too compelling but somewhat original. The same sequence was used in every episode for the knights putting on their magical armor but otherwise this was a great show for simple action, cool magic, knight battles (although 9 knights could always seem to overwhelm hordes of ""warlords"", hmm...). Was a nice walk down memory lane and the recording quality was the best I could expect from the original. If you liked the show when it aired you'll likely find a good price to reminisce with this one."
4,Needs a true ending,This was overall a good show to watch. The only thing that's missing is a ''true ending'' to it and to me not really a complete series without it. To be ''complete'' the real King Arthur and his Knights need to be set free from Morgana and the replacement King Arthur and his Knights of Justice need to be sent back from the time Merlin got them from. Since there's no real bad violence in it it's good to watch with older kids.
5,Great Childhood memories,Watched this as a child. Loved it the story is very thourough and compelling. Great kids show aged well also.
4,Great but could be better.,"It is great that this is out on dvd. the only thing is it that the sound quality is very low, very quiet. And that is a big thing when you have to turn your tv to max volume to listen to it."
4,Great show! Great nostalgia.,"This is it the complete series of king arthur and the knights of justice. Used to air in the 90s as a sunday morning cartoon. Something about the sunday morning cartoons were great. under rated and relatively unknown compare to sat morn ones. This one has all the action and magic and team work you'd expect from the 80s and 90s style of toy based animated shows. Although I don't believe the toy line did very well there is a fan base for this show. If your like me and got excited when this appered on netflix then sad when they removed it you'll want to pick this up. Good show for any age boy or girl although no strong female roles here, this is based on a football team going back in time so it's pretty male dominated action. There is a nice princess in distresscharacter though but she gets no super suit or transforming sequence."
3,A Gamey Knight,"This cartoon show was targeted for toys rather than any resemblence of alternate history. Most of the knights and their opponents sport ranged weaponry and magic that, while interesting, is not based in any kind of historical or mythology. Still a fairly rousing serries that ended way before it was prepared to."
4,my view of this series,"well i watched it and enjoyed i greatly however i found it not really to be complete series? don't get me wrong all the episodes were there. it is just the characters never really got home to one's dream of this series it makes one think that the time line was changed due to this fact that they never got home so i guess it got alot of lost interest and was cancelled before it should of been truly been finished??? none the less it is a good series and i do recommend this series for kids old and young alike if they like history,magic,lessons in life? they should get it before if does a vanishing act and may not ever return???"
2,miniature,"This episode is my favorite of all the Twlight Zone series. However, I was disappointed the dialogue is missing. I got a replacement from Amazon and the same condition exists. Maybe there was a bad production run, but it is surely frustrating."
5,Review on Gaelic is Fun,"I had earlier bought Gealic is Funtastic from another source before I realised that you also sold such books. No way could I begin with the ""Funtastic"" book as my knowledge of Gaelic is pretty limited. And so now I am finding this ""fun"" book very useful and am working through it with much more success in my limited spare time."
4,"Good for 2 yr old, probably too easy for 3.","Our little guy got this puzzle when he was 23 months. It took some demonstration and help to get the idea of the magnet. When he first started, he finally ended up just placing the magnet on the car, without employing the ""dangle method.""Now, at 25 months, this puzzle is a breeze. After a few times, he knew where the cars should go. Now he sometimes just feigns ignorance, giving me a sly look and grin as he places the piece on the wrong spot and croons, ""Nooooo.""The addition of the magnet challenge adds interest. We can challenge him to get the blue car, or the pink one, etc. Helps him with his colors.The recommended minimum age of 3 yrs is, I believe, may be too old. I'd suggest 2 yrs as a good age."
3,Fun - but gets old quickly,"I think this puzzle is adorable, but my kids find it booooring. The string with the magnet is rather long. The younger kids, who usually find wooden puzzles interesting, don't really have the control and eye hand coordination to keep the magnet still enough to catch the pieces. They tried it with a shorter string, but it still wasn't exciting. They did like playing pretend with the crunched cars - but as a puzzle it's a bust."
4,It all depends on the kiddo,"When my oldest son was two or three, he had a puzzle like this one which he rarely touched. Ten years later, I am purchasing one for my three-year-old, who can't get enough of the one at preschool. Go figure. He meticulously works at ""capturing"" and then replacing each piece. It's an excellent exercise in patience, motor skills, and hand-eye coordination. As with any toy, success depends upon the vagaries of the pint-sized consumer. Melissa & Doug products are always heirloom quality for a reasonable price. If you have a little person who enjoys working at things with his or her hands, I highly recommend this product."
4,Board game,The boys really enjoyed playing with this. It is very durable and they loved the colors in it.
4,Must have puzzle for little ones!,"Bought this for my nephew for his b-day, and he loved it. Hours of play time have already been invested. Great Toy!!!"
2,The magnetic tow truck will get lost.,"Cute idea as far as puzzles go. My 3 year old is enjoying it. But there is no way to keep the separate magnetic tow truck that comes with it together with the puzzle when not in use, so it keeps getting misplaced. I suppose if child loses the truck part it's still functional as a traditional puzzle, but I wish they would have thought of a clip to hold the truck/rod or something like that. I might try to fashion something out of velcro."
3,Great puzzle.,Great puzzle. Very creative design. Wipe down gently with a bleach solution. With all puzzles like this the sticker design can become detached. Can be made educational because the cars are different colors and have different numbers. I wish the design had a place to attach the tow truck car. Fun for ages 18 months and up. WE love Melissa and doug toys.
4,good sturdy toy,The Melissa and Doug toys are very good and durable. My son likes this one and the joey toy. I thought this one you could drag the cars around with the tow truck but it is actually like a puzzle.
5,Love this puzzle!!,This is a great puzzle for 2 and 3 year olds. I bought for my 2 grandboys and they love it. We guess the color of the vehicles and the numbers. Great toy!!!
3,Vintage Fun,"Bought this for my two year old son and he was excited to play with it. My son doesn't dangle the magnet he just puts it on the car of choice. He played with it an entire hour which is an eternity for my son . You do have to use some imagination with your child to keep the puzzle interesting like ""Pick the red car"" or Pick the number 2 car"" etc. So, I can see this puzzle getting old very quickly especially if you have a child that loves electronics. This was my attempt to introduce my child to some simple toys and overall it went well. I would recommend this toy for others trying to give child something simple."
4,Fun Toy,My 21 month old son loves these type of puzzles although this one is a bit harder. Putting the cars back requires a bit more skill since there is little variation between each car. I would venture a guess that it may take a few more months before he can put the pieces back on his own. Otherwise it's a very fun puzzle.
3,bought to young,my son was around 18 months when I bought this toy and is now [...]It is still a tough toy for him-the shapes are pretty intricate. I have an animal one that is much better for him.
3,Not good if child still puts toys in mouth,"I love Melissa & Doug products, but was disappointed to find that the details are stickers and not painted wood. My son is 18mo and starting to do puzzles, but he will sometimes put the pieces in his mouth (he's teething). The stickers started coming off immediately. My husband and I can only allow him to play with it when we are there to make sure the pieces don't go into his mouth. It's a cute puzzle and the magnets are neat for kids, but definitely a better value if your child is past the chewing stage."
3,A striking look at puberty. . .which goes on forever,Beautiful and honest and sad. . .butoverly-long and utterly confusing.
5,Simply put...,"...this is a wonderful film. Fanstastic music, cinematography, acting, and story. A brilliant piece of work from director Shunji Iwai. My favorite film of all time. Buy it. Now.;)"
4,Pretty DAMN good!,"I saw this film AFTER i bought the Lily chou chou CD soundtrack and let me say that the music itself is great but it became more special when i heard it throughout the film.The movie itself is good. I can't say it's great as i found it a little too long. But ultimately, it is a good film. It tackles the insecurities and struggles of the youngsters in their lives. Don't think this is a film only for young people though. I would say that even an adult would be able to identify with the film.The images are great in the film as well.It is not an over-the-top shocking film. The most extreme parts are dealt with in a more subtle kind of way.If anything, Bully and Kids are more shocking films."
2,grindhog day missing!!!,"the film grindhog day is not on either dvd, considering the back packaging claims soi made a big mistake buying this with the expectation of an actual tv show to be as good as touted by everybody on this products review board.i am never trusting troma again!!!even the main star is not all that cute(look about 20 something) and not that good an actor considering 60's trash horror film maker h.g.lewis is involved.seems all the horror film genre rejects go to troma.i will not answer any comment posts concerning this review."
4,A gore-fest with laughs!,"Only H.G. Lewis and Troma could produce something so sick, twisted, and hilarious. I'm looking forward to to season 2. Sally and her brother are going to go down as great cult classic characters. Campy fun for gore and Troma fans of all ages. Check it out!"
5,"Funny, magical, all you want in a cd","great Cd!!!, this album, witch is from the Los Angeles play ""vampire virgins from venus"", is one of the best. it's a cd that you keep!"
5,The Fourth Steven is a mystery with a whole lot of heart.,"From the gripping opening, to the surprising ending, The Fourth Steven is a book sure to keep even the most ardent whodunit fan guessing.Ms. Mosely has presented an exquisitely endearing cast of characters that made this reader wonder what's going on with their lives long after she read the final page.Ms. Mosely is much more than a flash in the pan mystery writer. She is a born storyteller with an adorable sense of humor and an amazing knack for drawing her readers into the lives of her richly painted, one of a kind characters.The Fourth Steven is simply the best read to come along in this genre in years."
5,HONEY OF A BOOK,"This is one fun book to read. Moseley's knack for off the wall dialogue and wry, sharp humor is evident in this mystery. Honey Huckleberry becomes a reluctant sleuth after a phone call from one of the three Stevens she knows is really a 4th Steven she doesn't know. From thereon out, Honey finds her rigidly organized life as a book seller representative in a tizzy. And now she has about four men in her life---her secret lover; a handsome if dense cop; a smoothly exotic gardener, and an old friend from school who is now a movie director. In the first half of the book, I can't count the times I laughed aloud at Honey's escapades, especially her paranoia and fear about the pantry in her parents' home. I hope I can find some more of Moseley's Huckleberry adventures; I just loved this book!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
1,Waste O' Time,This is definitely not related to the Ultimate Fighting Championship! This is pro wrestling garbage at its worst.
3,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I was hoping this book to be, at large, a sparring match between skeptics and believers--it was not. The articles by Goulder and Barclay were the most interesting whilst others were ridden with inspidity.I suggest ignoring this book. You'd be better off spending your money recent scholarship like The Empty Tomb for a skeptical viewpoint or Mike Licona's books for a conservative outlook."
5,Excellent,Para La Guerita de Oxnard:Primeramente muchas gracias por todo el apoyo pero por favor recuerda que Industria Del Amor es un grupo en donde todos sus integrantes son muy importantes para poder triunfar. Recuerda que todos tus comentarios sobre mi persona seran muy bien agradecidos siempre y cuando no hable mal de mis companieros. Otra vez muchas gracias por todo tu apoyo.
4,"Good product, and maybe the only option if you want carpet","Its a good product if are looking a matching carpet for your tan interior F150. it works good, doesnt move, color match the one in the truck, have the hole to secure the front one to the original place, and dont move even when I had not used the additional clips provided. They hold well in the winter. Protection is not the same as a digital fitted rubber mat from w***, but, if you want carpet... this is the one.if something , i think the sides are a bit raised and they took a while to get level as they were suppose to be. no problem."
4,"Nice, but watch the size","I ordered this ring in my normal size. Each individual ring fit, but when put together as a whole ring, the angles made the ring too small. It is very light; it doesn't feel solid. Still, I plan on reordering one size larger."
2,Not so good,"The ring was pretty good at first, but then it got all these scratches. The shininess went away easily."
3,solid speakers,"these speakers are all right, holds the bass very well, but the tweeters stop working the next day after install"
4,"Boss CH6CK Chaos Series 6.5"" Component Speakers (Pair)",Great speakers overall...slick look n great sound...only problem 4 me is that the tweeters were no good smh...had to buy another pair of tweeters to go with it
2,can i say more bass?,"I tried it on my home entertainment system and it sounded ok but when I placed it in the car, it stunk. Poor bass and I could barely hear anything from the tweeters. Had to turn the stereo way up to get any sound. Again, pony up the $$ and get some better quality speakers."
2,I just couldn't hack it,"I bought the audio book and started listening on an 18 hour plane trip to India. I only made it through 4 chapters. Maybe the book is easier to take, but the narrative style of the author on the audio book made me feel like I was in grade-school again. On top of that, the premise of the book was too simplistic. Fix yourself, get happy, clean your emotional house... I'm not saying the material won't enlighten anyone, but if you're awake at all, you probaly have heard what she has to say already -- and probably from someone less annoying."
3,living in the meantime,the book was very interesting but the title was misunderstaning it went a totally different direction while reading it. but beside that the book was worth reading.
3,not what I expected,This book was not what I had expected. It is mainly a workbook...not much to read.
5,Hair design,This book has very thorough directions and great step by step pictures. I would recommend this book for both beginning and advanced stylists. I personally picked up a lot of new ideas and I think you will too.
3,Development Story is Accurate but Tactical Analysis is WeaK,"This book presents a decent historical development of tank warfare and identifies most of the major landmarks and turning points. The book, however, does not provide many detailed acounts of armored actions and sometimes the enagements are difficult to follow. In particular, the book is lacking enough battle maps to properly illustrate actions and the terrain they occurred in. I was also dissapointed by the book's poor editing; it was clearly evident that the editor merely ran his spell checker over the document and called it complete. There are numerous incorrect words throughout the entire text; they are properly spelled, however. People who want a shallow history of tank warfare may want to read this book and will find it entertaining. For a better book on actual tank battles I would recommend reading Panzer Battles by F.W. von Mellenthin."
2,i don't like it very much,"I'm only half way through the book, but i agree with some of the comments of previous reviewers. For me, the book gets too bogged down in the minutae of some of the battles and doesn't put the military strategy in overall perspective. It also hasn't clearly shown the evolution of tank tactics resulting from the lessons learned from those battles, but merely describes key battles in chronological order and lets the reader draw their own inferences, rightly or wrongly. I really think the biggest flaw of the book is the lack of an overarching tactical focus/framework that helps integrate the battle descriptions and links the evolution of armored warfare. Also, although the book includes some maps, there aren't enough."
3,Where's the music samples?,"There are so many amazing artists that I'd love to buy their CDs, but I gotta listen to them first! It's mind boggling when I see more and more artists not having samples available for us to hear. Can't hear, can't buy. Bummer."
3,My first Esteban CD,"I ordered 3 Esteban CDs and I hope the others are better than this one. Maybe I just don't like the songs he picked to play, but they came across as ""contrived"" and the background accompanyment sounds a bit ""cheesey"". If I heard the cuts before I bought the CD, I would have skipped this one!"
2,Disappointed,"I like the excitement of Esteban's music. The way he starts out with a solo intro and then builds up excitement with a good supporting band. This CD has none of that. It is just a collection of solo intros. If you want soothing background music, this is for you!"
3,Good Cover,"I liked this cover; however, there is something about it that could be improved. You cannot use the USB adapter while the case is on the device because the opening at the bottom is not big enough.Also, my case arrived with some scratches on the screen. You would think that the company could send one without any flaws.It does protect the player by locking it into the plastic."
1,Useless.,"This is NOT the full text, but a study-guide for retards who can't read thirty-pages. I blame myself really, but Amazon has not made it clear that this is but a guide. Screw you Amazon and screw you Gale, and screw your Short Stories For Students. Also, screw Student's like me who though they could outsmart the system by not purchasing the expensive text-book with the stories in it, but rather take the stories out of the library. Also, screw the Boston Public Library's Copely branch for not having this in today."
3,Wish the Cups Were Really Corelle,"I bought this set to ""extend"" a patterned Enhancements set I have that is no longer available. The plates and bowls match exactly as to shape, style, and material. However, the cups, while the ""look"" is the same, are stonewear instead of Corelle material; they are heavier and thicker, and the color is not as white as the rest of the dishes. It doesn't say that anywhere in the product description that I read."
4,Good Dishes,"I just ordered these dishes and have been using them for about a week and a half. They are definitely better looking than your typical Corelle dish but still have the resistance to chipping and stack very nicely. I fit the dinner plates, salad plates and bowls all on one shelf in my cabinet which was wonderful!The mugs are made of stoneware and not the typical Corelle material which is a little annoying since it makes them a different color than everything else (including their saucers). Also, I ordered the tea pot and cream and sugar bowl and they are also the stoneware. While it isn't a big deal, I really wish the mugs were made of the same material as to my eye the coloring is noticibly different.That said, I would still buy these dishes again. I like the simple, plain white styling and how compactly they fit together for the cabinet."
5,White corelle dinnerware,"I was so tired of lifting those heavy stoneware dishes in and out of my dishwasher and cupboards. This dinnerware is light, and the white color can be dressed up for any occasion."
3,Average quality dish set,"Dishes are very chip-resistant. Dishes have not etched in our dishwasher over a few months of use (and counting), and still have a glossy appearance--except for the cups. The cups have been stained on the inside with coffee residue. So our white cups now look faint brown on the inside. Aside from that, the dishes have been great and I would purchase them again, as I consider the coffee staining a minor nuisance."
1,Broken Shards,"I have already told several people, the dishes arrived with a box of broken shards.............The price was refunded and I was satisfied. It really needs to be packed more securely...lin ferguson"
3,Dinner plates chip,"I really like Corelle for its look, lightness, stackability etc. But I have been disappointed in this set in that the edges of most of my dinner plates have chipped. It seems to happen when I am stacking them in the cupboard. The smaller plates and bowls are fine --it is just the dinner plates that I seem to have a problem with. The edges are sharp so I should be replacing the plates to prevent anyone from cutting themselves, but I hesitate to spend more money on this set knowing that the new plates will probably chip as well."
5,Nice Set,"It is a nice set, the only but I have is that the coffee mugs are just a bit different tone (they are not as white as the rest of the set) and 10oz instead of my 12oz previous ones."
5,works well,This dual burner hotplate reminds me of the one that got me through my college dorm days. The hotter element gets red hot right fast. These things are nice to have around to augment a regular stovetop. Has worked well for some time now since I purchased it.
1,Terrible..,I just threw my money down the drain. You are getting a 1 dollar quality for a 10 dollar price. I didn't have time to send mine back...I would not waste my money. The holder broke in two seconds and the phone does not fit. Amazon should remove this seller. It give them a bad name.
2,Poor Quality Charger,"The car charger included with this set is of poor quality. From Day-1 it had to be jammed in and twisted to ""make contact"". Now it has fallen apart within about 2 months of use. The case and ear bud are OK."
4,Powerful Story,I saw this play live and it was great! I'm glad it's coming to DVD so I can watch it with the familia. This story was very powerful and I think a lot of people will be able to relate. All the actors were great and the songs were inspirational. I would encourage everyone to check this out!
2,The lights should have stayed on,"The movie was ok. I did not care too much for the Grandfather wife, she was not funny. Some of the jokes were not funny. They seem to try to get the point a cross. The ending was not right. They left you to your imagination. It was okay like I said. There was nothing special that stood out."
3,DVD,"Disappointing based on the talent within the play. I expected more closure between the relationship with the wife, friend, and the main character's daughter."
3,"A Bit Grim, but a well written and readable book","I like Jonathan Raban for his willingness to wander places in small boats. First I read his book about going down the Mississippi in a large rowboat, Old Glory, and now coasting. Both are a bit bleak due to the author's general unhappiness. Raban is an unhappy guy plain and simple but he does have an ability to find and describe wonderful places and characters. The reader just has to look past Raban's negative outlook on everything, I really mean everything. I thought he only hated the United States but he really hates his home, England. But all considered he is quite readable."
2,Great premise foiled by political agenda,"The idea of sailing aroung the British Isles in a small boat sounds appealing and will be a dream for all but a few. Unfortunately Raban will lose many reader's beyond the first few chapters as he weaves his leftist anti-establishment banter in with the said theme of the book. I got the feeling he used the book a vehicle for threshing out his politcal bias. Come on, please! I suggest he re-write the book and let it take it's place as a modern nautical classic. He can write so well but this reader had trouble with the fact that Coasting should have been two books, not one."
1,Don't Waster Your Time,Don't waste your money on this bracket and have to pay shipping when. It doesn't even come with the screws to mount it with so you either have to go buy some or find old screws out of your garage or somewhere. Go to Wal-Mart and spend about $3 and get a bracket that will fit almost any car and actually comes with mounting hardware.
3,Had what I needed and a lot of what I did not.,"I rented this book from the local library and found the information in it usefull, but it had a lot of information that I did not need. In some areas it is so details that it drives you nuts and in others the information is missing or wrong."
1,Editor must have been asleep.,"I knew there was a problem when I found that the index shows chapter 7 as ""GM V6 and V8 Engines""! Chapter 8 is shown to be ""Ford V8 Engines"" and chapter 13 as ""Lower Gearcase (1964-1977)! Jumping from automotive to marine, chapter 12 is labled as ""Stern Drive Removal, Installation and Upper Gearcase Overhaul""! The book is actually about only 3 models of Yamaha Snowmobiles, (not all inclusive as the cover suggests) but errors abound. Laughable, AND THIS IS THE FIFTH PRINTING!!!"
1,Caution: DMARD users,"Dr Andrew Weil has recommended this product but cautions that it may not be effective if you take disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). My experience suggests that the product is not only ineffective but it appears to have triggered a flare-up. Those with rheumatoid arthritis and who are taking drugs like methotrexate, Enbrel, etc should use this supplement with caution. Your mileage may vary."
2,Not so sure,I have used this for over a month and don't see any changes. My arthritis may just be too far along.
5,WORKS!!!,Ive used it in the past and just used it again due to inflammation in the elbows from heavy lifting. The inflammation is subsiding.
4,Zyflamend for Reduction of Inflamation,I have been taking Zyflamend for about 6 months and have noticed a reduction of joint and muscle pain. As a result I feel better than I have for a long time probably because the Zyflamend has reduced the inflamation in my joints and tissues. I really like the fact that everything in it is natural. Some of the ingredients in it are herbs and spices we use regularly in our cooking. Also I like getting it from Amazon because it is much less expensive than in the local health food store.And their shipments are so prompt when it is time for it in the schedule I have established.
2,Not helping,"The product does not upset my stomach, and it has no effect on my arthritic either. I wouldn't reorder it."
4,good response,"I have had great response taking this. The combination of herbs is responsible for helping the muscles & joints to be much less tense & painful, thereby helping you feel better all the way around."
3,Zyflamend,"I have been using Zyflamend only for about 2-3 weeks, which really is not enough time to do a proper critique. However, it does seem to take the edge off of my arthritic pain. I am now alternating it with Naproxen which seems to be a satisfactory routine."
5,I like ithis product,"New Chapter Zyflamend Tiny Caps, 180 SoftgelI am using this product for my arthitus and stomach pain as I have colon ulsers. it is helping me alot. I like this product. I am planning to use this product all the time and I am recommending to my friends also"
4,Natural supplement for arthritis,"It is too soon to say whether this product has helped my arthritic condition, but it is highly recommended by the doctors who prefer to treat patients with natural and alternative supplements. I am hoping it will help so that I won't have to get into the Vioxx, pharmaceutical prescriptions which have so many side effects. The elements in this product could only help one if taken as directed. Pricing is fair market pricing even with shipping added."
3,Incomplete results,I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT ORDERED IN A SATISFACTORY TIME MANNER. IT IS TOO EARLY TO REALLY RATE THIS PRODUCT SINCE IT TAKES TIME TO BE ABSORBED IN MY SYSTEM FOR RESULTS. THE PRODUCT WAS ZYFLAMEND BY NEW CHAPTER IN A 120 CAPSULE SIZE.
5,An amazing supplement! Zyflamed!,"Greetings.What can I say. After taking Zyflamed for about a month, would you believe that: 1. I ran in a marathon race without ever training for it. 2. American Gladiators called and begged me to come on their show. 3. I hit the mega lotto twice in a row and now own half of the bahamas. 4. I jumped on my tramploline so high I had to watch out for low flying plains. 5. I do feel better in the joints after I excercise and have less fatigue than before. Really, I do feel noticeably better.Well, which one of the above is reality? If you guessed from numbers 1 to 4...I'm concerned for you. Anyway, number five is the truth and I want you to know that "" I approve this message"". Thank you for your support!"
3,"Good product, but problem in the packaging?","I am a repeat customer and am usually very satisfied with this product I also send a supply to my mother. When she opened the most recent jar, she discovered at least one of the capsules had leaked and covered the surface of the others. Of course, the taste is not too pleasant. I would have sent them back but it became too much of a hassle in the end. At the price, I expect better quality assurance!"
2,Zyflamend - good and bad,I tried Zyflamend for a couple of weeks and found that it irritated my IBS so I can not tolerate it. I think it did help my knees though.
5,Very helpful,"I have tried other products to help relieve the pain I suffer periodically in my thumb joints, especially when the weather changes or when I have been using my hands a lot. This is the only product I have found to be helpful.It takes 30 days to take effect, but is well worth the wait. My son-in-law and husband have also found it helpful.When I had surgery recently I had to go off of it at the request of the doctors, my pain returned and I couldn't wait to get back on it. I know it doesn't work for everyone because I have recommended it to others and not all have had the same results as we have. But we have found relief both in frequency of pain and intensity."
2,Great product-- thinly disguised PRICE INCREASE,"3 versions of exact formula- either called TinyCaps, or Easycaps or Whole body. To get the dosage starting with Rosemary 150mg it takes SIX Tinycaps or TWO Whole Body (used to be called Easycaps) There is up to a 47% price increase for these newly ""rebranded"" Whole Body (from Easycap) caps or even worse price for TinyCaps. Exact same thing Easycaps used to be about $35 for 180. Do the math. I spoke with rep at New Chapter and they refuse to admit that Easycap dose was 2 per day-- said it was a packaging error for all of those months. Am looking for similar product by a company with integrity. dont blame New chapter for trying to profit from their success, but be HONEST about it."
1,Did nothing for my pain,I was excited to try this product after reading all the glowing reviews. The pain in my joints has increased a lot in the past few months - and I began a search for somethign that would help. The product came on time - but has not had any positive effect. I finally gave up after I had used the whole bottle with no positive effect.
3,Gi distress,I took this product for approximately 6 weeks with improvement in my severe knee pain but I traded it for a pretty serious GI upset that did not resolve until I discontinued using it. I am very disappointed as I can't take NSAID's either and this was the best non-narcotic relief I've had. I think its just my body chemistry-the older I get the more things seem to upset me. Be sure you are drinking the full glass of water.
2,I have not been able to see any positive results.,"I have used this and so far have not seen any benefit from this product. I certainly wanted to, since the price is right and what is listed on the companies website. So far no good for me"
2,zylf.review.,I have used this product for about 2and half weeks and I do not see any results as yet. But I sure hope it will take place soon.Bob
1,Zyflamed side effect - Stomach Pain,"I am 50 years old and and began having neck and shoulder pain a few months ago. A friend recommended Zyflamend. The first day I took one tablet with lunch and another tablet with dinner. The next day I had terrible burning in my stomach, like an ulcer. I also had major indigestion, with minor bloating, and gas. Before taking these tablets, I had no stomach pain or indigestion problems whatsoever. I take no other medications. I am relatively healthy, eat well, and am moderately active. I quit taking the Zyflamend and it took several days for the symptoms to go away. I do NOT recommend this product."
1,Cheaper to make your own,"Zyflamend has a whole slew of herbs in it that are potentially helpful, but theres not enough of the herbs. It is better to take one big gun (ingredient) than to take multiple ingredients with just small amounts. I did try this product for 2 months with no results of joint/muscle pain. If you really want to have more potent medicine just buy some organic herbs and make tinctures with them. It will be a whole lot cheaper and powerful than buying this product month after month. Don't be fooled into buying this product and as far as the ingredients sometimes less is more."
2,NO efffect so far,"Touted as an anti-cancer mix, especially for prostate cancer. Nope. No effect on PSA rise. The ingredients are probably not harmful, though, and may be beneficil in a mild, general way."
1,Meh,Yeah maybe this isn't for me. I was hoping it would help me out with some wrist tendonitis but it didn't do a thing. I've had better results from exercise and a Paleo diet. So you might want to look elsewhere. I do take their vitamins so that's why I tried this product.
4,Zyflamend seems to help.,I started to take Zyflamend twice a day after I had surgery for prostate cancer three months ago.I think that it has helped me in reducing inflamation.I told my doctor about it and showed him the information that came with the bottle.He was not aware of Zyflamend and did not seem to be too impressed and did not encourage me to continue taking it.I will finish taking what I have left and may get one more bottle but most likely will discontinue after that.It certainly has done me no harm and may have helped me more than I am aware of.So I would recommend it on that basis.
2,Didn't agree with me,"I am a runner and every day exerciser. I liked the idea of the Zyflamend and when it was offered to me through the Vine program I jumped to get it. Well, I have been taking it for just about a week now, and I can tell you that I have not derived any benefit from this with the exception of some really bad stomach and intestinal troubles. I am not sure what is causing it. From looking at the ingredients, it looks like a lot of the stuff I already have in my spice cabinet (oregano?), but there is something in here which does not agree with my digestive system. So, after a week of taking it, I am done. Thought I would develop a tolerance, but it never happened no matter what I did (eating or not eating before or after taking it didn't make a difference either). Maybe it's just me, so I am rating it a two star instead of a one star."
4,"New Chapter Zyflamend, 60 Spftgels",Item met my satisfaction and would reorder when needed for my inflamation problems I have been having the past few months.
2,No effect,"Frankly, these supplements are highly variable in their effectiveness. I have an RSI injury and bad knees, taking this daily for two weeks has yielded no benefit. For the high cost, this is not worth it."
5,Great benefit,"I used to buy this from another source, but it seems the price is better at Amazon. I began taking this by chance, somehow I discovered the product and have taken it ever since. I had a swollen knee and began using Zyflamend and the knee gradually began to lose the swelling. It took about 6 months to decline completely, but nothing else had helped in the prior 6 months. It has also helped the swelling in a knuckle disappear."
5,Zyflamend,"I have been using Zyflamend for about 6 months. It does a terrific job of reducinginflammation. I just found it on Amazon.com and it is quite a bit cheaper than Ihad been paying, plus with the subscribe and save feature, there is even more savings and no shipping. Thank you Amazon."
1,Vitamins,Was not pleased with this product so I sent it back. This was the first time that I ever sent anything back.
4,I'm hopeful,"I have psoriasis and have had high CRP for several years. This past year the CRP jumped from 3 to 10. I started taking Zyflamend and also upped my steroid use on the psoriasis. I 1 month the CRP went from 10 to 4. Not sure if it was the zyflamend or the steroids, but I'm hopeful that the zyflamend had something to do with it. Haven't noticed any change in my joint pain yet."
2,No quick fix,"I've been taking the product for a good month now, and notice little or no difference. Not the dramatic ""I felt better within a week"" report I'd have liked to give (which I'd seen from others), and I do think after a month I should notice something...So, honestly, not sure about this product."
4,Relieved Some Pain Issues,"I have ongoing pain in my joints and back. My girlfriend has been taking Zyflamend for a few years and swears by it so I thought I would give it a try. I also read that it may prevent prostate cancer. After a month I have noticed a lessoning of pain in my fingers and lower back. Nothing miraculous but noticeable. I don't believe any pill will fix me. Diet, exercise, enough sleep, a good bed, etc., are equally important. I will say that this is potent medicine (open the bottle and smell to see what I mean). It did upset my stomach a few times and needs to be taken with meals and lots of water. I will continue to take Zyflamend in the hope that my stiff joints will further improve."
2,How much does placebo play in this product?,"I have to say, reading the reviews on here, I would have expected a drastic improvement in my neck and shoulder pain after taking this product for several months along with New Chapter Wholemega. If there has been any improvement, it has been barely perceptible. I often wonder how much these herbal supplements are actually effective vs. how easily people are duped by fancy sales pitches. In addition, this product seems to give me back acid-reflux.To be fair, many of the ingredients have been studied for their effectiveness in inflammation-related pain relief, and New Chapter actually does do third party testing for some of their products. However, that does not mean every one of their products is useful and effective, and I'm afraid this falls in that category. ... Back to ibuprofen."
2,Didn't Help My Wife Much,For what this product costs we were hoping for much better results. My wife will be going back to using Ibuprofen since this didn't offer much if any relief to her back.
4,don't take at bed time,"I made the mistake of taking this at bedtime. I have chronic Lyme, EBV,Fibromyalgia and chronic insomnia and have not slept for more than 2 hours at a time but this was the worse, I slept 1 hour. I ordered the PM and will try that. It did help some with the inflammation and neuropathy but next I will take only 1 capsule."
1,Negative Reaction to this Product,"This product claims to help with inflammation. I took it for 1 week, once aday and had no relief, Following directions that came with the product, I took it for 2 more weeks, twice a day. No relief from inflammation, and I had severe problems sleeping. Night tremors and restlessness. During the 2nd week of 2 pills a day, I got less than 2 hours of sleep per night. Stopped taking this medication, and within a few days, my normal sleep pattern had returned. I was very disappointed in this product, as it was highly recommended by the Dr. Oz Show."
4,generalized body pain is decreased,"I had taken this product 7 years ago while on a strict Vegan diet, and with that combination, felt better than I had in 20 years! Due to family problems I went off that diet, stopped taking most of my suplements and (of course) all the old aches and pains associated with being overweight with diagnosed Firomyalgia returned. Last year I rediscovered this product in a Health Food store, and started taking it again, and made some adjustments to my diet and within 2 months, realized decreased generalized pain and ability to work easier in my garden! I have and will continue to recommend this great product!"
2,new chapter zyflamend,"The picture that is shown for this item is not what I got the picture says whole body and that is for the capsules that you take one twice a day the larger capsules and that is what I thought I was getting.But when I recieved them it was 180 count of the tiny caps,and you have to take 6 a day so I paid too much and didnt get what I thought I was getting.I didnt send them back because I needed them but I wont order again.Should really have it said that its the tiny caps and use that picture!!"
5,Amazon is my best source for Zyflamend,My wife's Dr. suggested this product for her knee inflammation and after checking it out I tried it for bursitus in my shoulders. It worked better and faster than the NSAIDs I had been taking plus there are no side effects. I wouldn't be without it now and Amazon is a reliable source with low prices.
4,Seems to work!,I seem to feel better when I take two of these in the morning and then go exercise. I have been taking for 6 months and the bones feel good!
3,One bottle not enough to tell effectiveness,"I've had some inflammation in my knees and thought this product would be a good choice to try out. It's really hard to say for sure how effective it is as I near the end of the bottle. It seems like it helps. For me, I'd rather try something natural before relying on a prescription drug. The only thing I don't like about the soft gels is that they're rather large and are a little hard to swallow. I'm going to continue to take the Zyflamend and see how I progress. It's had so many other positive reviews that I think it's worth the investment to try it."
4,"Good, but make sure you eat first","I've been using more and more of the New Chapter products because I've found them to be high-quality and effective. This one is no exception. The only downside is that you really, really have to make sure you eat first before taking this. A lot of supplements say to take them with a meal, but mostly you can get by without taking them with a meal (at least I can). However, if you take Zyflamend without eating -- and I recommend eating first, not just popping your pill at the same time you eat -- you will likely end up with a burning upset stomach. It's an effective product, though. So as long as you remember to eat first, I'd say try it and see how it works for you."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Buyer beware. After years of purchasing New Chapter, they sold-out to Proctor and Gamble, one of the world's leading chemical companies. A chemical company buying an organic company. It doesn't take much to know that the quality of their products are at total risk. Very disappointing. Switching to a company I can trust for now."
5,Great for back pain relief,"I've suffered from back pain for 3 years. I'm only 31 and didn't want to take a prescription NSAID for the rest of my life. Anytime I stopped taking the NSAID the pain would return but NSAID's cause extreme heartburn for me. After seeing this product recommended on Dr. Oz I decided to try it even though it isn't cheap. I went from waking up every morning stiff and in pain to waking up limber and feeling great. My pain was so severe I could hardly lean back to stretch, after only a month on Zyflamend I've gotten back almost all of my flexibility. It's amazing to be pain free."
5,Zyflamend is a great anti-inflammatory formula,"I was diagnosted with Tendinitis in my right shoulder in July of 2011. It was painful and limited my mobility in my right arm. Not to mention many of sleepless nights because I couldn't lay on my right side. Thanks to Zyflamend I no longer have the Pain, got most of my mobility back and can sleep on my right side without any discomfort. I highly recommend this product to anyone with imflamation issues."
2,didn't help,I have severe pain in my left leg and left hand.I know there is no tears or anything wrong that requires surgery.I've been told it is arthritis and many people have recommended this product.I've been taking 2 tablets for many weeks but have seen no improvement in my leg and some improvement in my hand.It did make me constipated though.
3,Skin Rash Side Effect,"I've been taking Zyflamend for a couple of weeks and I feel a bit stupid for not even considering that it might be the cause for the strange rash I have developed on my legs, under arms and chest. Of course! These are potent herbs and I have very sensitive skin that breaks out and flushes when I eat spicy food.The pills had an obviously positive effect on a knee that was bothering me, though, so I recommend it for others. Nor did I have any stomach/digestive issues, except for really bitter breath. It's important to drink sufficient water while taking these supplements."
3,Gary Moore: After the War,"Gary Moore may be the most versatile, underacknowledged and underappreciated guitarist since the '60's Roak Era began. He is a master rock guitarist from the '70's and '80's who has rekindled his phenomenal blues chops since the '90's, often duetting with the Old School Blues Masters Albert King, Albert Collins and BB King, NOT giving up a note of virtuosity to these revered guitar heroes. His '80's material (of which After the War is merely one source) is only outdone by his subsequent blues pursuits and collaberations. I bought this CD as part of a catalogue remastering series and await the introduction of each new addition to the series. I can not say enough about this guy's playing despite some rather cheesey videos, representative of the '80's hair metal period, that are beneath his true sonic abilities. GIVE HIM A TRY!"
3,best of the 80's,"I give this one 3 stars because of all the 80's music Gary has done this one is the best.Not by much,The one track that makes this stand out above the rest is the Roy Buchanan cover The Messiah Will Come Again.Led Clones is sung by OZZY and is also a good song.Dunluce pt 1&2 are instrumentals not bad and there are a few others ,But nothing to write home about definately his best 80's work by far In my opinion GARY's BEST WORK IS HIS BLUES CD'S! After Hours, Still got Blues, Back to Blues,Old New Ballad Blues,Bad for you Baby ,Close as you Get,and Power Blues Check out these titles you won't sorry."
1,"This was not 80""x80' as advertised.","Not as advertised. It was not 80""x80'. It totaled 28 ft. In length. It looked like grain sack cut apart. Thieves!!!"
1,FOURTEEN LESSONS IN YOGI PHILOSOPHY,"I do not recommend this book for persons seriously interested in the study of eastern philosophy. This book has nothing to do with yoga; that is, the teachings of the rishis'. I should have known from the title that this book has little to do with yoga,since it should have been yoga philosophy,the discipline, and not yogi philosophy,a person who studies yoga. If you like your ""yogi"" philosophy sprinkled with the word ""Occult"" almost (it seems) every other sentence,(which Eastern Philosophy is not)then this is the book for you. Personally I recommend the writings of Ramakrishna,or Yogananda(the autobiography of a Yogi). This book was a terrible disappointment to me;I stopped reading it before i was five pages into it. I would recommend Hare Krishna liturature before I would recommend this lightweight effort."
3,The Latin is Wrong,"The latin in this version is badly translated at some crucial points. Anselm is a philosophical genius and this translator does not do him any justice. For example, I came across this: ""(God) of all things exist to the highest degree"" which is a statement that God and his existence is calculated, and that at one time, God's existence was possibly a lesser degree befor the attainment of the higher. The real latin simply states 'highest existence' in this context. As a theologist and religious scholar, I do not recommend taking this translation word-per-word, despite it being from the Oxford Press. Honestly, I would recomment learning Latin (though see I have not) and it's not everyone who has the time. Be careful when using this to prove your own arguments on the Ontological argument or other concepts Anselm goes over."
5,Mmmm. . . Satisfying,"A great album. When I first got it I couldn't stop listening to it for days. Do you like cute girl voices? Are you into Portishead, Metric, or Kelly from the Rosebuds? Do it. Buy this album."
5,Lots of nutmeg,"I wasn't sure how many nuts were going to be in this package. I just wanted a few, but there are over a dozen nuts in this package. I have given many away to friends and family. There is a brief description about the use of the outer layer for mace and the inner kernel for the nutmeg. If you don't have a need for so much nutmeg, it makes a great gift for the other cooks in your cirle of friends."
3,May have gotten wet in transport,"A little moldy in the pkg, think the package may have gotten wet...all in all not a bad price for the size package."
5,Great product,I had been looking for whole nutmeg for years. I 'm glad my search is over. It taste so good!!!
4,"oh yeah, I remember that one.....","Getting Hooked is an apt title for this book of ""first lines"" of well-known books written between the 1950's and now. In the category of ""Why didn't someone think of this before,"" it is a very laudable effort at organizing famous books in various categories, and is bound to either rekindle the idea of re-reading your favorites from the past, or prompt you to read for the first time a book you are likely to enjoy because the first lines grab you--the yardstick by which most readers decide to read in the first place! For her effort Ms. Rendell- Smock deserves credit, and readers will surely benefit."
5,Great Documentary,Very good documentary displaying the rivalry between the two most important ladies of the make up industry. The two ladies who started all this in america.....
5,Angelic Bliss,"Rilke is ecstatic! And the ecstasy is contagious! Nothing like this has been written in the last one hundred years. This is a beautiful edition of Rilke's poems that really grasps the essence of his angelic, poetic rhythm and quiet, sincere voice. The only contemporary work I know to compare it with is (un)leash's ""Hymns for Brueghel"" which are also prose-poems, and I believe (un)leash was directly inspired by Rilke as well. I truly feel that Rilke has been unsurpassed. These are sacred writings, to cherish, a tome to have by your bed or on your shelf for the rest of your life."
5,Good science fiction,I believe that the best science fiction both entertains and really shows you something about the world. This book is good at both. Its a great read but it also gets you thinking about a lot of the basic questions of who people are and why we do what we do. Cool stuff!
4,Ok.,Not the greatest out there. But does have some interestering photos of flight gear. There are short descriptions on the development of some of the equipment.
1,"Extremely basic, painfully slow","Perhaps useful for very young children with no musical background. The cover states ""whether you are 7 or 87, the....series guarantees fun drumming for all."" I think anyone over the age of 12 or so who has had a music class is school would find this too simplistic. I viewed it once in stunned silence then gave it to a local pre-school."
5,LOVE IT!,Beautiful lavender fragrance. Lovely soap for bath and sink! It lathers nicely and does not over dry skin. The large refill is handy and economical. I save my bottles at my bathroom sinks to refill. I highly recommend it. (love the foaming hand soap as well!)
5,The only hand soap I ever use,"I first discovered this soap wehen we visited Zion National Park ten years ago. The hotel where we stayed stocked only EO products in our room. We loved the light fresh lavender scent but the best part was how mild it was. For the first time in years, I was able to wash my hands as many times as I cared to without my skin ddrying out, cracking and bleeding. I purchased several bottles from the front desk to carry home with us, but worried where I would find replacements when they were empty. Luckily, I found EO online and discovered that they carried this large, economical refill bottle. Now I keep one of these gallon jugs on each floor of our house, and make sure we NEVER run out. I have severe eczema and this is literally the best, gentlest soap I've ever used."
4,An excellent way to roleplay the Marvel way.,"If you're interested in roleplaying, character development and storylines, this is the Marvel game for you. If you're a stickler for rules and measurements down to the finest detail, then stick to the older game or the Champions system. The new Marvel Game fits perfectly into my existing campaign ideas. Powers are easier to use. The game master, or Narrator, has full power to direct the plot with little need to bend any rules or flub dice rolls. In other words, the Ñarrator and players control the story. And that's what it's all about, isn't it?"
2,"One step forward, two steps back","Having really enjoyed the earlier Marvel Super Hero Role-playing Game I was quite interested in its successor. However, I was disappointed for the money I spent on it. This game could be nice for a group of players with little experience with role-playing games and who want playability above all. If you are familiar with the old game or a die-hard role-player you will find the system annoying. I tried to sell my friends on trying the ""new thing"" and card based system left us cold."
2,Original was better,"I purchased this game the week it first shipped, though I wish I hadn't. For someone who has never played the original Marvel Superheroes RPG, this game may seem adequate, but its greatest strength which is its tremendous detail, is also its greatest weakness. The card based system is a joke and characters tend to die way to easy. I am happy to see that marvel took a lesson from the old Mayfair DC system and allowed a way for even weaker characters to stand a chance, but they over did it and anyone can kill anyone else if they want to bad enough without any thought to the plausibilty of the confrontation what so ever. EX: In the first game we ran, just to bug out the system, a player playing Electra beat the Juggernaut. I have talked with several others who have purchased this game and they had similar ideas. To anyone considering to buy, do your self a favor and scour your local garage sales to find a copy of the old TSR sytem, it'll cost less and is a lot more fun."
3,RPG,"A new version of the Marvel Super Heroes game. This is where it gets annoying for the licenced properties and game thing, someone else gets it an does a completely new game.One thing that was so great about the FASERIP version was the decade of support and heaps of stuff.Planned obsolescence to sell new stuff is not fun, but the card mechanic here is interesitng."
3,Adequate System,"A somewhat fast-paced role-playing system. It uses a deck of cards instead of dice, which makes an interesting change of pace. Another interesting quirk is that the gamemaster/narrator doesn't...well, _do_ anything. If an opponent/non-player character tries to hit your player, your _player_ makes the determination of success or not (by dodging). Kinda interesting in that it lets the gamemaster worry more about the story then endless die-rolling.Despite several explanations and re-explanations, there are some parts of the rules that are still kinda vague. As someone else noted, character stats are rather...thin. Presumably the nice quality deck of 96 or so cards boosts the price up, but hey, I've seen it in bargain bins for much less (the game is out of print).Basically, it's a nice ""fast"" game to pick up, and you won't have to spend a lot of time explaining to folks. Like the original TSR Marvel SuperHeroes RPG, it's fast-starting and players should catch on to it pretty quick."
4,Dope,"This album is truly a masterpiece. The conmination of these three artists together produces a lethal combo. I like tracks, 3,4,6,12."
5,I Don't Understand How People could hate This!,"I've always enjoyed the jurassic park movies. I say they are one of the best movies Steven has ever done. I Think the lost world personally is the best cause it all in the jungle most of the time it's dark and rainy. Don't forget that now they have 2 T-rex in this movie and they are ten times bigger then the first one in Jurassic Park. I will agree that it was kinda weird that they had to have a T-rex go through a city like it was Godzilla the (1998 Film). If You ask Me the 3rd one was not as good as the first 2. it's not the same without the T-rex but, the Spino. wasn't that bad of an idea. The T-rex will always be the best. I really hope that the 4th one brings it back. Jurassic Park is not as good with out it."
3,A great suspense movie for those who like monsters,"A great suspense movie for those who like monsters.The special effects are fantastic, and the photography astounding. One does have to have a strong stomach to deal with the man-eating monsters. Also, one needs to put up with some romantic environmentalist preaching. Very suspenseful."
1,Bad,Bad sequal to one of the great movie experiences of any time. Speilberg should have stopped when he was ahead.
5,The best Jurassic Park movie in the series,"The Lost World was really good, JP 1 was almost as good, and JP 3 was okay. I don't have The Lost World yet, but I rent it all the time. The reason why I like this one the best is because of the T-Rex roaming the streets of San Diego."
3,Deja Vu?,"A dinosaur makes its way to an unsuspecting metropolis. It eats a few people, stomps on a few cars, destroys a few buildings, makes a loud roar as it is silouetted against the lights of the city, is overcome by the work of a crafty scientist...Hey, didn't they do this in 1953 with ""The Beast from the 20,000 Fathoms?"""
1,An insult to Michael Crichton,"I am very disapointed in this excuse for a movie based on a book. The book is a great example of Michael Crichtons amazing work, but this movie takes all that and tosses it out. It depresses me to know that people would see the movie without reading the book. When someone hears ""The Lost World"" Michael Crichton should come into mind, not Universal Studios. It contradicts so many points in the book it is offensive. Sure the visual effects are good, but so what? That's all nothing without a friggin plot. If you see this move, please, for Crichtons sake, read the book first."
2,What a Letdown!,"I love Jeff Goldblum, but he didn't carry this film. The film was ruined for me the second Julane Moore (yuck!) and the ridiculous, lame token Black daughter of Goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in Hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film. It's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter. What a concept. It just added to the disbelief of the characters (stay Goldblum), the storyline, and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel. Jurassic Park III wasn't much better."
1,Already Saw It,"Let's see, a group of explorers investigate reports of monster-like creatures on a remote tropical island. After discovering the creatures, greedy capitalists decide to capture one and take it back to the United States for display (and profit). Once back in a major American city, the captured monster escapes and wreaks havoc upon the city's buildings and inhabitants. Only the intrepid couple who originally discovered the monster can overcome it and save the city.Hmmmm, let's see, where have we seen this before? Could it be, oh, I don't know, perhaps, KING KONG!Talk about an original premise."
1,Evidence against the need for sequels,"OK, everyone's mentioned how wonderful and truly groundbreaking Jurassic Park is and I agree. But this movie was horrible. Julianne Moore needs to stop taking roles in sequels (hannibal) Anyway, I would have given this movie 3 stars but it lost one star because scenes were ridiculously long and the scene where the Malcolm's daughter does her olympic bar routine to fight the dinosaur--talk about corny."
1,An insult,"'Jurrasic Park' is a landmark film, one of the best adventure films ever made and one of the greatest FX films of all time. Then comes the sequel - 'The Lost World'. This uninspired hack job of the wonderful book is an insult to the magic of the first film. Boring characters and a decidedly unoriginal plot, which includes the King Kong rip-off sequence in which a T-Rex is running amock through the city, makes this one of Spielberg's worst films. I, like so many people, was simply devastated by it. Not even the great FX could salvage it. Avoid this movie."
1,Eco Terrorists are the heroes of Lost World,"The ""heroes"" of this movie free dinosaurs onto unsuspecting hunters who had them in cages. The dinosaurs destroy all the hunters' life- saving equipment which leads to massive loss of life.Later our ""heroes"", who have an opportunity to drug and thus stop the T-Rex from crushing people in San Diego lead the T-Rex on a dangerous street chase so that they can save the T-Rex's life.Lots of characters died in order to save animals in this movie. Personally, this movie offended me because I think human life is sacred."
1,Waste of two hours.,"This plotless wonder has you cheering for the dinosaurs from minute one. First, you hope they eat the entire cast, then, you hope they eat the entire city of San Diego. Nice special effects cannot counteract a muddled script, poor acting, a pointless plot and a kid.Save two hours of your life, you'll never get them back if you watch this turkey."
2,Put this movie in a lost world,"Jurrassic Park was always Known for it close call Action and realistic Dinosaurs, this one not as much. The story was not as good and the action is more of a laid back style. Not as much action or dinosaurs. Actually i cant say I enjoyed this one. With all the impossible stunts done, I mean at least they keep it partly realistic in the 1 and 3 but this one you Knew what was going to happen. Unless your a complete dumbass. Pretty much a disappiontment to the dinosaur world. I give a 2 out of 5."
1,Perhaps the worst movie ever made,A pointless waste of time in which men with large guns are chased by terrifying creatures and NEVER manage to fire a shot at one. Not even worth the laughs. Disappointing in that so few of the annoying main characters are eaten. I kept hoping beyond hope that they would all be consumed for stupidity.
1,I bet Sam Neil is glad he stayed away from this dino turkey!,"This film gets one star only because there isn't an option for 0 stars!The first jurassic park was exceptional,good acting,well written!But this!Very poor acting,lousy action sequences and more plot holes than you can shake a stick at!Spielberg should have stuck with the novel instead of releasing this dino excrement!"
5,WHY DO PEOPLE HATE THIS JUST BECAUSE IT'S A SEQUEL?,THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT. THE DINOS WERE BETTER AND THE RAPTORS HOW THEY JUMPED YOU COULD SEE HOW HIGH THEY JUMPED IT WAS INCREDIBLE.THERE WERE TWO COUNT THEM TWO T-REXES AND AN INFANT. AT THE END THE MALE T-REX LET THE INFANT EAT THAT GUY. IT WAS GREAT I SUGGEST YOU GET THIS MOVIE YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED.
3,Less plot + More dinos = Shallow sequel.,"Although shallow, contrived, and practically plotless, the Jurassic Park sequel The Lost World does deliver the thrills when the dinos come out to stomp, roar, and devour the supporting cast and lead bad guys. The movie is a tad darker than the first and features a bitter taste of greedy cynicism, but the T-rex rampaging through San Diego is every monster fan's dream come true (and gives screenwrier David Koepp his just deserts for delivering such an illogical and insulting storyline), and that sequence is the sole reason for the three stars as opposed to two. A big budget cinematic equal to substandard big bug schlock like Earth v The Spider or War of the Colossal Beast. Worth seeing once only for the San Diego segment."
4,"Great, but Book is better","This movie was another outstanding achievement, woth a whole lot more action. However, it has nothing in common with Michael Crichton's novel, ""The Lost World,"" which is what this moie really should have followed. While the book is better, the sequel to one of the greatest film achievements of all time shouldn't be overlooked by anyone."
3,Needed more from book,"I really thought the whole, My girlfriend is on the island so I must go save her, was really stupid. Coulden't they find a better way to get him there? Unlike others, I did not think the acting was that bad. I really thought Jeff did a good job. I thought the special effects were good too. The thing that really made me mad was that the movie was compleatly different from the great book by Michael Crichton. If you read the book but have not seen the movie, DO NOT BUY THE MOVIE. It will be a waste of your time and money. Instead go and read the novel again. The fact that they changed the characters and made new ones for the movie was just plain stupid. I say it would have been a better movie if they just stuck to the book."
3,The Movie's OK,"This isn't the best movie as far as plot and such but for effects and lights off soundtrack movement, this is it! The first one probably is an all around better film, but this one has it's moments. As far as the DTS comment and lack of extras, DTS is from what I am to understand 0 compression. That leaves alot less space on the DVD for extras. I for one am glad to see any DTS DVD's as it is superiour to 5.1 in just about every way (except for space). Glad to see classics like these finally hitting the press."
1,Spielberg's Worst Film to Date,He should be ashamed to be associated with exploitation trash like this. I am sure it will only be a matter of time before the second sequel violates the public's intelligence.
1,"downright terrible, a disgrace to...well, movies altogether",This movie was downright awful. All it was was a special effects vehicle in which we could be treated to watching dinosaurs attack for 2 hours. There was no plot whatsoever. The book and the movie have no relationship whatsoever. The book had a plot. The movie did not. I fail to see why this movie made that much money. I could give a **** about special effects. Give me something interesting like Apt Pupil or Star Wars over this anyday!
1,"How Could You, Michael???","If I were Michael Crichton, I would have disassociated myself from this loser. The movie bore only a slight resemblance to the book. One of the main characters in the movie doesn't even appear in the book. The two kids in the book don't appear in the movie; instead one of the kids becomes Jeff Goldblum's daughter. What was the point? The screenplay stunk. And a T-Rex rampaging throught the streets of San Diego like Godzilla? I know Spielberg did part of it for laughs (showing the Japanese tourists running for their lives), but this movie, with its sledgehammer style and weak plot, was nothing but a big sell out. Mr. Crichton, how could you let them do this to you? You have so much talent! And Mr. Spielberg, how could you take such a dive?"
2,WHAT?,"What happened to the book. they mutilated the entire plot and most ofthe charecters adding in their own and making some up. the totaly made up the movie as they went along, not bothering to use the book as a guideline for creating the movie. this is a disgrace to michael crichton's book the ;lost world. Burn this movie. after reading this review, if your wondering why i have given it 2 stars instead of 1, it is because of special effects."
4,A great dinosaur movie for people who know how to have fun!,"Lost World is not a perfect movie, but it is a great rollercoaster ride for people who have affection for B-movies. The only things that weaken it are some of the surplus characters, Jeff Goldblum's daughter and his girlfriend. (They have nothing valuable to do but sabotage everyone's efforts to stay safe from harm. They're too needy and have no important reason to be there.) Pete Postlethwaite (Not sure of the spelling!) more than makes up for them. I would have loved to see him and Jeff Goldblum in more scenes together! But, I'm happy with what they've done. This movie is thoroughly entertaining; stupid gymnastic scenes and all.(I laughed out loud!) Both times I saw this movie in the theatre and everyone was just as happy and entertained as I was, no one asked for their money back or cursed in anger. Some people's lives are too complex to take dino-movies sooooo seriously! Lighten up, critics! Let's see if you could do better!"
3,"Not bad, but not good either","Okay, so this sequel makes the first film look like a masterpiece in comparison, but I still enjoyed most of the movie. It has some great special effects and a literal cliff-hanger sequence that was nail biting. But then you get to the corny gymnastics sequence and everything goes downhill from there. Some great actors do their best with what they have: Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postelthwaite and Peter Stormare are all great. But did Goldblums character really need a daughter? She brought down the movie with every scene that she was in. Her character was totally unnecessary. This movie is worth a look or two, but that's about it."
4,vanessa,"this is a perfect sequel ians daughter kelly jane malcolm (Vanessa lee Chester)she plays a 13 year old who wants to be with her dad ian (Jeff Goldblum)on all his trips she would rebel to go to anyones house not movies,horseback riding they dont even have sega!she plays an active girl who dont listen to noone and loves gymnastics i love vanessa lee dhester and the gymnastic scene, i do gymnastics myself"
5,A Jurassic Thrill Ride. Not as goof as the original.,"Most sequels tend to stink and downgrade the first. This may not be as good as one but it definately is one of the most action packed and hardcore sequels. I loved the performances, especially Julianne Moore's. I am also glad you got to explore the Ian Malcom character more. The special effects improved drastically, but they did not stand out too much from the first. The movie all in all is one of my must sees. It is probably one of the best movie sequels out there, see it now."
2,"Entirely Unrealistic, except for special effects","Except for special effects, everything in this movie is unrealistic. Starting with the casting: Since when are Archaeologists hot lusty young red-headed chicks?Gee, where can I get this year's archaeology pin-up calender?I miss the days of more realistic movies, like ""Andromeda Strain"", where the scientists actually looked like scientists, even the female ones.The story is more akin to a cartoon than a movie. Much like most of Spielberg's stuff."
3,2.7 out of 5,"Out of all of Steven Spielberg's many films, THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, the sequel to the blockbuster megahit, is for certain the master director's worst. It details a team sent to bring back Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) from a Site B containing more dinosaurs, while another team is sent to capture the dinosaurs and bring them back to L.A. Jeff Goldblum stars as Ian Malcom, the humorous mathematician from the first film, who knows right from wrong - he just can't get anyone to listen to him. The special effects are again excellent, and Williams' score is very good, but when it's a Steven Spielberg film and it gets nowhere above average, you can't help but feel extremely disappointed. Featuring almost no relation to the novel from it was adapted by Michael Crichton. Next up: JURASSIC PARK III."
3,There is enough heartn pounding stuff here!!,"This movie is truly a fall off and had to be. Lost is the wonder we experienced when we say those dinos alive for the time. But there is enough heart pounding excitement here to make this movie worthwhile. It was a close call, but ultimately i did purchase the DVD.A word about Jeff goldblum. For me he was just an actors face in the crowd. That spider movie was to creepy and not very much fun to watch. But when you put his performance in the first 2 jurarassic parks, with Independence Day, which i liked a lot and i think very differently (positively) of Jeff then i see him in the credits now."
5,Great price and played like brand new!,This dvd played as if it were brand new and the price was excellent. Great way to get movies that we love on dvd.
4,Good movie,We have enjoyed all of these movies from the beginning to the return to the island and then this one.
5,grrr,one of the series. if you liked the others you will like this one as well. hope to see another some day.
2,Frustrated with Amazon Prime,"I have Amazon Prime and for some things it is great. Service and access to movies through Amazon Instant Video is excellent, but I do not understand why there are many videos I would like to see that are not available. I ended up having to purchase this video since it was not included on Amazon Prime and wasn't even available for rent. I did not want to buy it but it wasn't available at the local movie rental store either.It was double discouraging when I went to connect the ipad to the tv and learned that Amazon Instant Video doesn't support this function. So I ended up with a movie I didn't want to own, watching it on a 9"" screen. Not real happy about that."
5,goog,Like the movie watch it way back when it came out at the movies got 3d tv cant wait till i can getbit in 3d
5,Lost World,Plenty of action in this movie.A well written story as well produce.Very good special effects.The acting by the stars is very good.
4,A fairly decent sequel!,"Personally when rating this movie it is difficult to rate it based upon its own merits. Being that this movie is a sequel to a blockbuster hit, it has a lot to live up to. However that all aside if this movie were to stand on its own it would make for a fairly good movie. Okay the characters do not have the depth of some other movies, it still does not make the film less entertaining. It is a great ride that Spielberg sends us on in this film that can leave you breathless in some parts. This is a great entertaining ride that makes for a great movie night. However that all aside I believe that the movie should have ended on the island. I will not say more. You know what I mean if you saw the movie. Otherwise a decent film."
1,The worst Stephen Speilburg film that I have seen,"This is by far the worst adaption and I don't even think that you could even call it an adaption of a Michael Critchon novel. The only thing in the movie that comes close to resembling a scene from the book lasts two seconds and even that isn't close to the book. But the thing that annoys me most about this movie is if the only dinosaur on an oil tanker is a T-rex and it's locked away in the tank compartment, is how did the crew get eaten in spaces on the ship where the dino couldn't fit into. Even worse the city scenes where a rip off of another bad movie, Carnosaur."
2,The Book is better,"Recently I read the book. Having watched the movie 3 times I quickly fell in love with the book. The movie I cannot rate that well because it is nothing like the book. The characters are different, the animals are different, and they even added a part which wasn't in the book. Yes, that is why the ending is so horrible, it was never in the book. No dinasours go to the main islands, and even if they did, why was it that the main island was some major city like LA or San Fransisco, I thought they were in Porta Rico? Watch the movie, enjoy it if you want. But you won't get the full thrill, excitement, adventure, and emotions as the book will. In Jurassic Park John Hammond and Ian Malcolm die. What are they doing alive again. John Hammond is also a mean old man who swears a lot. Why isn't he like that in the movie? To make it a kids movie. Even the way it is it still doesn't classify as a kids movie. Remember: You won't have anything, until you have the book."
3,"2nd Jurassic Park not as good as the first, but.....","This installment in Jurassic Park is dinosaur overkill, and a little comedic, the T-Rex running through the streets as Japanese people run away...But, it's entertaining, and a must to buy if you're a Jurassic Park fan. It's the same with Indiana Jones, the second movie was lacking, but if you're a fan, you end up buying the box set, and watch it anyway along with the other two...Still a good film, albeit a little over the top and silly..."
1,Something has gone terribly wrong,"Why they couldn't leave the dinosaurs alone after the first movie? I mean, sure, it deserved a sequel, but not like this one. Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) goes to ""site B"" because he wants a woman off the island before she gets eaten. 'Nuff said."
1,Just Terrible.,"This is probably one of the worst movies i've ever seen.The first movie had special effects which,at the time of release were incredible and glossed over many of the flaws in JP.In this movie it's all been done before so the actual movie comes through...this is too bad for the movie makers."
1,Bomb,Jeff Goldblum returns and has to deal with more dino mendees when it turns out there is a secondary island containing the creatures.Too bad he has to deal with some greedy hunters too.Disappointing and slow at first this sequel loses all the entertainment value the original had with a cliched script filled with bad plans only to end with a ridiculous Godzilla-like rampage finale.Groanable gymnastics scene to.
2,Nem sempre é possível repetir a dose,The Lost World - O Mundo Perdido - segue-se ao Jurassic Park. Deixando de lado o aspecto tecnológico no sobra nada na fita. As duas estrelas so atribuídas exclusivamente pela tecnologia empregada. Nada mais.
1,OH GOD!,"This movie is terrible, I got it for christmas the year it came out, I watched it and couldn't beleive how terrible it was. There was really no definite plot, unlike jurassic park. They should have gone more by the book on both movies. The first and the second movie are way different than the book. If they were like the book they would have made millions in the box office, and not been such a flop."
4,WHY ARE SOME OF THE REVIEWS SO LOW???????!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a pretty good movie, and I don't see why the average customer rating can be four or five stars. It's a great movie, except for the fact that the part(...) Pretty good movie, all in all. Four stars."
4,What's Not to Like?,"Not sure why so many people seem to dislike this film. Laugh if you like, but I think it's the best of the entire series. After watching the first one, I found myself aching to see what Spielberg could have done with the dinosaurs in a big city environment and boy, did he ever deliver in this one! I stood up and pumped my fist in the theatre when the T-Rex first appeared on the outskirts of the big city and let out a deafening roar -- serving notice to the populace that total mayhem was about to ensue. Spielberg takes us on a fun-loving, even nostalgic trip back through the Monster/Sci-Fi films of the '50s and '60s by ""freshening up"" the whole genre. It's a terrific fantasy that any American boy would love to watch -- nothing but good, old-fashioned fun. And isn't that what movies are supposed to be anyway? In a word, this film is ""awesome""!Chris H.Florida"
3,"Nothin' like the book, and not as good as the first!!!!","After ian malcolm discovers that his girlfriend has been sent to an island crammed with dinosaurs, he ends up getting into deeper trouble after running after his chick with a bunch of wackos who were not even in the book!This movie is not as good as the first movie. In fact, it's 2 stars below it actually! There is not as many good actors as the first, and the dinos aren't as good either. The best bit of this movie is when the rex trashes through san diego like an elephant on a climbing frame.Watch this movie for a good night out, but there are better movies out there!"
2,Too cartoony,"Look, Julianne Moore is NOT, COULD NEVER, NEVER EVER, be an archaeologist.Ridiculous.Just ridiculous.Becoming a scientist involves LOTS of college; lots of college involved LOTS of studying; lots of studying involves saying the heck with your appearance, eat junk food, stay up late, do whatever it takes to pass this class, get this degree--all of which makes you an ugly nerd, but also makes you a scientist.Check out almost any scientist and you will find they typically have ""radio faces"" as opposed to the ridiculous, Baywatchesque ""tv faces"" which we are subject to by these cartoon-headed moviemakers.Bring back the realism of sci-fi cult classics like ""Andromeda Strain"" where the scientists ACTUALLY LOOKED LIKE SCIENTISTS. Wow. A little realism. Even in a B-movie, a tad little bit of realism goes far.This movie resembles a cartoon in it's casting, more than it does real life.Oh, and yes, it is very, very, very predictable.Everybody dies who is supposed to die."
3,NOT GREAT,"I loved Jurassic Park, sort of, but this was sorely disappointing in so many ways. First, I know that a movie can't follow a book to a ""T"" but this one went off into outer-space! For the most part the movie didn't even take place in the same setting! Also, the feel was all wrong, character and plot manipulation rivals that of ""Queen of the Damned."" If you read the book don't watch the movie ever, it will leave you with a sour taste."
2,EEP!!!!,"This movie was very medeocre. I don't really like Jeff Goldblum very much. I think they should just end the movies. It is alright to see only once, but it for sure isn't worth buying."
2,movie differs from the book.....it's disappointing,"Goldblum is a good actor, but it would be better if the movie resembled the book. he carachters are different. I saw the movie first, and thought the book would be close. Well, I have never been more wrong. the plot itself is differen. there are way to many ""hunters"" and the methods of getting on and off the Isla Sorna are to different to be humanly possible. Stay away and don't waste your money. it is too much of a dissapointment."
2,Terrible plot,"I own it, my Father likes some of the quirky one-liners but I certianly don't and it lacks the charm of the original. Really bad idea to deviate so much from the well written book."
2,Slow-paced and dull.,"While the first Jurassic Park will always be among my favorite movies, this one is just plain bad. One, too much of the movie is just talking and talking. It takes forever for the dinosaurs to get in it, and even then theyr'e not as terrifying and cool-looking as the other movie. Just skip this one. It's bad. However, Jurassic Park III is a very good movie and I reccomend it."
3,It could have been much better.,"I was one of the millions of people who flocked to see The Lost World: Jurassic Park the first day it opened. I liked it the first time I saw it, but, as the glamour of the film wore off, I saw how hollow it was. Jurassic Park, the movie was terrific. The Lost World book was actually pretty good, but Spielberg (probably wanting to give Universal Studios a little something before he took off to DreamWorks), gave us what his imagination saw. He has a pretty bad imagination. The roars were much duller, the animations weren't as crisp, the Raptors (although more accurate to their real-life physical description) are much smaller and are given one small chase scene through an abandoned city, which looked like the film was looking for more time to waste. And the T-Rex run through San Diego was a waste, although pretty funny. Buy the book or the first movie, cause you aint missing much here."
2,Why?,"First of all, I give this film one star above its lowest rating, simply for some of the action sequences and special effects - no one can deny that they were well done.Now, what I would like to know is how on Earth Hollywood can inject such an inflated budget into a movie and not care less about the plot? After reading the book, I thought.. hmmm this would make an interesting movie, however found this movie to be totally plotless! If they'd stuck to the story in the book, they would have rescued this mindless travesty! If they didn't want to stick to the story in the book (for some narcotically influenced reason)- they could've at least made sure that the bloody thing had some sort of a plot!"
3,Sequel in the usual tradition,"I would have felt a bit miffed if I'd paid cinema prices to watch this. However, on rental or cable this movie is worth a shot.We all know the story by now...dinosaurs rampage and eat lots of people. What is mildly surprising about this movie is the distinct feeling of deja vu. There are no real additions in terms of feel to the original, other than a different cast and a weaker plot.Don't get me wrong - this doesn't make the film unwatchable. Just bear it in mind while watching it. It's almost certain that you'll love it if you loved the first, and there are some great (if not a touch contrived) scenes.It will, however, probably make you glad they didn't (please!) venture into making a third."
2,"Great special effects, nothing else.","The special effects in Lost World are even better than those of Jurassic Park, and this alone may make the film entertaining for many viewers. Unfortunately, in an apparent effort to target a teenage audience, the movie's creators have made a film with an absurd plot line and adult characters who act and speak like children. Consider, as just one example, the scene where the main group decides to bed down for the night in the jungle right after having been pursued by a hungry T-Rex; needless to say, they do not post a guard and the T-Rex ""surprises"" them while they are asleep. Although action films like this one do not need to be seamless, as one might expect from a ""serious film,"" the level of idiocy in this movie will annoy most adults."
2,AN UNWORTHY SEQUEL TO JURRASIC PARK,"THE LOST WORLD should've remained lost, it doesn't even come close to the original JURRASIC PARK the creatures look all too much the ones in the original JURASSIC PARK. It is not all that scary even kinda dull at times the game hunters in this film I thought were unecessary to the story. I also felt JEFF GOLDBAUM'S acting as well as of the rest of the cast was below average as well, it is not as bad as GODZILLA but it's pretty close."
1,Go see Jurassic Park 3 instead.,This movie is very disappointing.The script was very bad and the cast play stupid roles.Just skip this movie and go to Jurassic Park 3.
4,the lost land,"THIS ALMOST TOPS THE THIRD AND THE FIRST. HERE ARE THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT.1. THE RAPTORS HAVE CHANGED MINORLY2. WE GET TO SEE THE REX IN THE CITY3. VERY SUSPENCFUL (TRAILOR SCEENE)4. THERE'S A LOT OF GORE5. SOME VERY GOOD LINES ""TAKING DINOSAURS OFF THIS ISLAND IS THE WORST IDEA INT THE LONG SAD HISTORY OF BAD IDEAS"" AND ""I'VE BEEN ON TWO MANY SAFARIS WITH RITCH DENTISTS TO LISTEN TO ANY MORE SUISUIDEABLE IDERS.""HERE ARE THE BAD THINGS ABOUT IT1. TOO MANY CHARECTORS2. THEY'VE CUT UOT DINOSAURS LIKE THE TRIKES AND BRACHIOS3. JUILIANNE MOORE'S CHARECTOR AND ARLOS' CHARECTOR ARE ANOINGTHE SPECILE FEATURES ARE GREAT"
3,An well made sequel which is more of a remake at times.,"After four years of the disater of the could've been Popular Theme Park:Jurassic Park. Now two groups are in a race against time that will determine the fate of the remote island's Prehistoric inhabitants.This sequel has great visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic. But the film suffers a weak Screenplay by David Koepp (The Trigger Effect, Stir of Echoes). This is Steven Spielberg weakest film to date but this film is still entertaining. DVD's has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer & Superb DTS 5.1 Surround Sound & Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround Sound is also alivable. The weakest in the series. Grade:B-."
2,Be Careful,"This edition is not the edition of The Lost World that comes in the two DVD Jurassic Park Collector's Set. It does not have deleted scenes, conceptual sketches, designs, and storyboards, models and The World of Jurassic Park. If you want the addition with those features buy the two DVD set or find one that Amazon says has those features. The package may look the same but it is not."
3,"Great effects, so-so story, dumb characters...","As many have said, the special effects are rather good in this story, though the impact is not quite as great as it was with ""Jurassic Park."" The problem is not with the special effects. Where the movie suffers is from a weak storyline and incredibly bad writing of characters. In this movie, you'll see human beings doing and saying some of the dumbest, most unrealistic things imaginable, which keeps reminding you that the dinosaurs are not real (otherwise, why are these humans acting this way and saying these things?). I realize that this was meant to be high entertainment, and I don't have anything against making a fun dinosaur movie, but for a movie claiming to have realistic depictions of dinosaurs, you kinda need the humans on screen to respond realistically to the dinosaurs on screen for it to work. As it is, there were many good ideas here, but it fell very short of what it could have been."
2,Jurassic Park was a lot better,"What was the deal with bringing the Tyranosaurus to San Diego? That was not in the book, which, might I add, wasn't very good, because Michael Crichton pumped it out really fast so it could be rushed into a movie. Jurassic park was original, this one was old, just like Austin Powers one and two."
1,Cheesy Not as Good As The Original,"I'm suprised that Spielberg didn't make Jurassic Park 2 more scarier than the original. There was no plot. The acting was bad. If you want a scary, entertaining movie, get the first one."
2,The world that should have Stayed Lost!,"What happened here?!?!?! What once was arguably the best sci-fi book ever written was translated into...this! It is sad to see how a great plot can be mutilated into a bunch of childish nonsense! Sure, it has its moments. The trailer scene is great,but only because of good directing by Spielberg. Everything else is special effects and the writers thinking ""Let's see how much we can scare 'em!"" Well, not much. Still,it will do great with the kids, and is a good idea for your 10 year old's B-day present. Otherwise, just not worth the money."
5,i think it's what i have been looking for in a movie,"i think it all i like in a movie comedy,love,action and alot of bloo"
4,Almost as good as the first film,"This movie is a great movie if you are into thrillers, it made the first Jurassic Park seem like a happy movie. The majority of this movie has a dark, scary theme to it, making it a lot more thrilling. Even though I don't feel the actors are as good in this one, Goldblum did a decent job in acting his role out. Also the dinosaurs are more believable and realistic in this movie than in the first. Thats how it earned my four stars."
5,The Lost World Rocks!!!,"The T-Rex, Velocirators, comsognathus, mamenchisaurus, gallimimus and so on, these dinos are unbelievably amazing!!! To say the truth I like the Jurassic Park a little better than this one but this one's also thrilling and exciting. It's possibly the best PG-13 film I've ever watched so far. The mercenary team tries to capture many dinosaurs and while Ian Malcolm and his team frees the dinos, the both teams faces extreme dangers and gets stranded on the Isla Sorna. Will they ever survive? Find out while you're watching this fantastic film!!!"
4,Real Good,"This Sequel To The original is almost as good. Jeff Goldblum is great as always and so is Julianne MooreBut the real winner here is the Special Effects that easily live up to the original. If you want to have fun, The Lost World is your movie.P.S. Don't Pay attention to some of the negative reviews. If you look closely, you can see that they are written by the same person."
1,JURASSIC BOMB: THE LOST MOVIE,"Unbeliavable someone can give this pile of garbage a five-star rating! To show my point of view, I suggest something to you all: why don't you have a private and informal talk with Spielberg himself and ask his real opinion about this motion picture...? YOu'll probably hear him say that this is one of the worst he has ever done, that he did it only because of the money (the studio pressure was too much) and that he never watched the movie once after he finished it."
5,One of my Favorites,"Jurassic Park left me in awe at how CGI could make these creatures, that I have loved since I was two, come to life with such realism! I was hoping for a sequel.Fortunately, four years later I got that sequel in the form of this movie.I felt the dinosaur action was more plentiful in this one than the previous installment and we get to see some newer faces in the dinosaur community.The acting is pretty good but seems to get a little off key here and there.Overall, I thought it was slightly superior than its predecessor and is one of the best dinosaur films out there!"
3,Good.......but could've been way better,"Give this one an extra half-star for the superb special effects. This sequal to the 1993 smash-hit blockbuster ""Jurassic Park"" is not up to the usual, expectant Steven Spielberg standard. It could've had way better character developement, too; Jeff Goldblum is only OK in his return role of Dr. Ian Malcolm. And what's with all the Australian accent guys with big guns trying to act tough?But don't get me wrong, this isn't a necessarily a bad movie; it definitely has it's moments. For instance, the scene with the trailer hanging off the edge of a cliff is one of the most suspenseful scenes I've ever seen! But if you haven't seen it yet and you're a big Jurassic Park fan (like myself), then definitely see it."
3,Get the Tv version instead.,"I think the theatrical version of The Lost World was okay,but the Tv version is way better than this version.The Tv version has many scenes that were edited out from the theatrical versionlike,the scene when Roland and his friend are talking in a bar,the scene when the T-Rex's try to attack Kelly in the High,high,the scene after the brief encounter with the Stegasaurous,and many more that might have made the movie sense.My opinion is to catch the Tv version on Fox,or just buy the DVD and watch the scenes im talking about."
5,"It Beats Jurassic Park 3, that's for sure.","Nothing can top the first one, but this is worthy enough to follow it. If you want to see the real sequel to Jurassic Park, then this is it. If you want to be sit though a bad movie then I suggest seeing Jurassic Park 3."
2,Jurassic Plot,"I hate to say this, but the sequel to one of the best films I've ever seen is nothing more than a bland cash-in. There are great special effects and some good characters (the send-up of paleontologist Robert Bakker was amusing) but they don't stop this being nothing more than entertainment. As an evening's viewing it's good, but watch it again and you'll probably be bored senseless. And why are there so few new kinds of dinosaurs? Ray Harryhausen et al never resorted to showing the same things over and over. The only realy good thing I can say about this film is that its made to look the height of sophistication by that execremental Godzilla film."
2,Just a monster movie,"I'll agree that this movie has plenty of typical thriller fare which can entertain, and seeing the dinosaurs is still interesting (though nothing like the first time). But when I saw the Raptors streaking through the field, closing in on a party of unsuspecting humans, I said, ""This is just a monster movie. Nothing more.""I bother to write a review, however, because I'm still irritated at this story's philosophy judgement. The good guys are horrified at the team of ""capitalists"" who want to put the animals in a zoo. How could they be so cruel?! So an Earth First activist works with the lead female character to set them free and rescue a baby T-Rex. That single act causes almost all the deaths in the movie (including the activist's partner), but the story gives the activist a pass. The capitalists are the bad guys in this picture, least the viewer be confused, and most of them get eaten as they deserve. Ugh."
3,Don;t mess with nature!!,"Not quite as good as the original, another group of scientists return to the island only to discover a group of hunters are also visiting. They capture a dinosaur which manages to escape and the T-Rex, in a Disneyland-like sequence, goes crazy in American suburbia. It is recaptured and returned with a formal message to the viewer, don't mess with mother nature!!"
2,unimaginative effort,This plotless sequel is a disappointing let-down from the well-constructed and believable JURASSIC PARK. It depends on violent special effects as an excuse for being. The only bright spot is Jeff Goldblum's acting.
3,People are too critical,"Ok, so it's not as good as The first movie. Or the book. Or the film it is named after, but I still think it is quite a good movie. If you don' compare it to those other things, or even the first JP movie, it is a good film in it's own right. I enjoyed it when I bought it, and still do today (The DVD's features aren't spectacular, though). I like dinosaurs, but I think they could have used some variety. T-rex's and Raptors are cool, but there are hundreds of other Dino's to choose from that are just as menacing. Anyway, I encourage people to maybe have a look at this, and if you all ready have, see it again."
3,"Good, dumb fun","This movie was a major disappointment for me and a lot of people. It can't be compared to the awsome ""Jurassic Park"" but it is a lot of fun to watch. If you want a movie with plot and suspense, get the first movie, if you just want to see a bunch of really cool dinosaurs cause trouble and eat people, then this is the movie for you. It's got a basic (rather lame) plot, uninspired characters, and a less than thrilling soundtrack (considering it was scored by the great John Williams, this is suprising) If wanting a copy of this video, I recommend getting the Collector's Edition. The new scenes add to the plot and develop Roland Tembo's (the hunter) character. Like I said, this movie won't go down in history or anything, but it is fun to watch"
3,I like it anyway :),"I like the color and shape; it's super cute and lovely.But if I could get informed about the size beforehand, it must have beenmuch more satisfying.The size wasnt informed at all and surely the picture doesnt tell enoughabout it which made me feel like the actual pan seems smaller than I expected."
4,"""Old Priest"" review","If I had been the character in this book, and had gone through it all, I would be on some south sea island after a short visit to the Sierra Mountains. Well worth reading. Would make a hell of a movie"
5,Must Read,"It has been a long time since I ""couldn't put a book down"" this is one of those reads. Set aside a Saturday afternoon for this one."
4,"Overland Sheepskin Co. Women's Parisian Sheepskin Slippers, COCOA, Size 8","The slippers are true to size and very warm. However, had I known they were made in China I might have had second thoughts about ordering them.I assumed that they were made in the USA by Overland. One slipper's sheepskin on the top was not identical to the other, and therefore stands out as far as plushness of the sheepskin. But, since I'm not going to be critiqued on my slippers I can live with it. It's just something that I'm aware of."
5,Warm and comfortable sheepskin sleepers,"Lovely, warm and comfortable natural colour sheepskin sleepers.Excellent model for ""biggish feet"" as it makes them look smaller!!Can't wait to kick off my shoes and slip my feet into them when I get home!"
3,"warm yes, too large","I purchased these slippers because I read what everyone had to say about them. They were comfortable, warm and cozy.No one mentioned they tend to run big. I ordered a size 7 and they are falling off of me.Other than that they are toasty."
4,What They Say They Are,"After ordering and returning a number of other slippers either because they didn't fit or didn't look good, these did both -- fit and looked good."
5,He is the best there is and the best there will be.,Enrique Iglesias is one of the greatest latin singers ever and an album in which most of his best songs are included must be one of the greatest albums in the history of latin albums ever.That's why I recommend this album to all latin fans and those who listen to spanish music.
2,You can do it much better,"Buying this CD, I thought its a no-brainer, but actually the songs are pretty boring. Do not expect the songs to have a quality somewhere near to the recent ones. Skip this one and buy the new CD."
3,So so,"As a fan of period pieces, in particular Wives & Daughters, The Buccaneers, etc., I was quite disapointed with Clarissa. While I cannot fault the actors for the story line (quite disturbing), the acting was so so and far from believable. As the price is quite expensive for these dvds, I would wait for it to be lowered or purchase it used."
1,not a chic flick,"For the book I have never read, maybe this was a good movie.However, I was deceived by the description on the back of this movie that it would be great to watch, but I am very disappointed that it did not end the way I expected"
4,Virture and the Rake,Very interesting and fast paced miniseries. I saw this on PBS when it first came out and had to buy it for myself. Clarissa is a charactor of depth and Lovelace is richly sinister. Facinating to watch Clarissa's family push her to distruction. I enjoyed the whole miniseries but the one episode of violence is not appropriate for someone under 17 years old.
2,Disappointed.,"As a fan of Acorn Media and a viewer of anything BBC that I can get my hands on, I have to say that I was disappointed by this production. Lovelace was far too villainous (every villain needs a redeeming quality). And the presentation of the ""fake fire"" followed by his complete recklessness seemed straight off the set of a high-school play.I regret being this harsh, as I'm always rooting these programs to be first rate. But the performance turned up no redeeming characters for me -- save for Hermione Norris (whom I have worshipped ever since seeing Berkeley Square). Saskia Wickham's performance as Clarissa is without nuance, never truly tempted and predictably snappish throughout.I walked away from the screen wishing Andrew Davies had writ the script."
1,Too Dark,"If you like Pride & Prejudice, you won't like this film.This movie is too dark and foreboding for my taste. Yes, the actors play their parts well, yes the costumes are terrific, but the script leaves you feeling depressed and yelling at the tv, ""Enough is enough!"""
1,Shocking and depressing,"WARNING, SPOILER: Clarissa is hounded by an evil young man whos see her, at first, as nothing more than a challenge. then he is obsessed in possessing her even if it means sullying her honor and breaking her spirit. Toward the end of the movie, after many twists and turns, when it is clear that she wants nothing to do with him, and rapes her while others hold her down, something I didn't expect at all. She feels so violated, that she wills herself to die. I hated the story so much that I regret viewing it. Had I known about the rape scene I would not have wasted my time watching this. Silly me in believing that virture will always triumph--certainly not in this story. If you love Jane Austen and all that her heroines stand for, then don't waste your time on this story."
1,YAWN...,"Not what I expected when renting this movie. As others have said Clarissa came off too pure and innocent. Futhermore, I don't understand why such a viriginal woman would run off to be with one of the most horrid men in the world? Everyone knows what Lovelace has done..there are numerous accounts. Yet she goes with him anyway? Blah. The acting was OK. The costumes were excellent(I love period movies) but the plot dragged and dragged and dragged. And as another put it, I was very glad when Clarissa kicked the bucket.I read a lot of historical fiction, classic novels and love period movies, but there was no liking this one. It just couldnt be done."
2,"NOT GOOD, DISAPOINTED","this movie is the most disapointed i've never been with a movie i've picked for my wife and i to watch, save your money."
3,You like sad stuff?,"I had high hopes for ""Clarissa"", since it had been on Masterpiece Theater, and most end well. This one was marked by extreme characters, hard to believe, and endless cruelty to poor Clarissa. Thought it would at least have some kind of happy ending, but everyone is ruined and Clarissa is dead. You sure don't get a happy feeling by watching this one."
4,Mystery with a heart,"Chief Inspector Banks is called in to investigate the disappearance of a little girl named Gemma. Her bewildered mother has let her go with people who claimed to be from a child welfare agency, but instead they kidnapped her. Banks is haunted by the picture of the child, as she resembles the inspector's own daughter. Following this, there is a grisly murder of a man who may have been connected to the missing girl. It is up to Banks and Detective Superintendant Gristhorpe to put together the pieces of the two puzzles into a coherant whole. All of this time these grizzled policemen keep a mental picture of Gemma in mind as motivation to solving the crimes. This is another well-written Detective Banks Mystery by Peter Robinson."
2,Wednesday's child is wooden.,"As far as police procedurals go, this is sort-of ok. For my taste though, the characters are a little flat and too one dimensional. I could not get through this bland piece of soft-boiled prose and had to put it down unfinished. I found Banks and his companions very wooden and not believable. Excluding the victim, there was not enough to go on to feel any true sympathy for the other characters. The plot line IS interesting but gets to a point of being turgid. Perhaps I'll give it another try someday."
3,Wednesday's Child,"I enjoy all the Inspector Banks books, this was no exception. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys, crime books."
4,Another Robinson Winner,"""Wednesday's Child"" is another outstanding offering from the talented Peter Robinson. Each of his books are carefully constructed police procedurals and Robinson consistently exhibits an ability to build sensitivity, tension and character into each of his novels. This one features Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks, the star of most of his novels, but it also gives added dimension to another favorite Robinson character, Detective Superintendent Gristhorpe. The two of them, with their loyal, able Yorkshire police comrades, methodically track down the kidnapper of a little girl. As in all the other Robinson novels, the bad guy is usually not who you think it is. And by the ending, you know that you have read a book written by a literary craftsman. I look forward to reading many more Peter Robinson books."
1,Very bad.,This is one of the rare books that I could not even finish. Very inaccurate and it seems as if it was one more outlet for Mr. Pacheco to toot his own horn some more. I do not want to go into all of the mistakes but please do not read this and think that you have learned anything.
1,I was very disappointed,"I was very disappointed and embarresed.I gave this item as a gift and found out later that one peice was missing from the box ( large dinner plate).I will never buy anything thruogh Amazon again.I would like for you to replace this plate but I guess I will never hear about it.Corelle Impressions 20-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4, Delicate ArrayTerry Lynn Smith"
4,Excellent ballads and pop songs!!,excellent effort from Ariel in Espanol. Caliente! Tu Piel is something for Ariel to be proud of. El Amor de mi vida on the cd is excellent.chantes1998
5,Trying not to live in the past,"But I can't help it. Everything was cleaner, simpler, NICER then. I spent my teen years at the Empire Theatre, Shaw's Candy, and the rest of WP. There are some pictures in this book that even native San Franciscans will be surprised at. A great addition to anyone's SF history library."
1,Good BUT.....,"Sadly this product contains partially hydrogenated vegetable oil that is bad for you. Lawry's, please remove this ingredient that is probably unnecessary and is actually harmful trans fats."
4,Great!,"This seasoning came in a great size and is good. I used in soups and baked meats, too much garlic flavor for eggs, etc."
2,Find Super Cruel and Terrible Tales of Mangaka instead,"Not enough humor content to make it worthwhile. The humor harps on the same points again and again. Find Super Cruel and Terrible Tales of Mangaka instead which spoofs mangaka's although different genre's get the focus.Both are the equivalent of hanging out with male artists at a bar with too much booze. The difference is that the next morning, this book is filled with a bunch of ""did I do that?"" moments versus ""That was cool."""
1,THIS GUY SCREWED ME OVER!,HE SENT ME THE WRONG CHARGERHE DIDNT SEND THE CRADLE TO CHARGE THE PHONEMIC WAS ALREADY BROKEN WHEN I RECIVED THE PHONENOT A REAL SIROCCO EDTION PHONE. HE SWITCHED THE HOUSING ON A PHONE TO MAKE IT BLACK.
3,"a fun read, and thought provoking to boot!","This delightful book was an easy read, yet the unique approach to spirituality kept me thinking, even re-examining the way we think about ""god."" The plot and commentary push open the mind's windows and let some new light in, and like a draught of fresh air, rejuvenates the mind."
2,Doesn't quite make it,"Cecile Licad is a fine pianist, but she's not right for this. Maybe she's trying to put too much ""Artistry"" into these instead of virtuosic fire, although perversely she plays some pieces too fast. This is still quite nice, considering the low price, but don't throw away your old Leonard Pennario LP's."
2,"Jarring, solpsist","Cecile's interpretations are full of grimace-inducing WTFs; it may, unfortunately, be my first and last Gottschalk album. Gottschalk himself, in the hands of a self-transcending artist, might be enjoyable; but Gottschalk is negated here by ""look-at-me!""-ism: which is tragic, really; since I came here after hearing Union, and was intrigued by its bizarre mixture of Americana and Franco-romanticism.Any Gottschalk fans in the house have a favorite realizer, by the way? Would love to hear some suggestions."
3,Good Product Bad price,Good product but Iherb sales it for under 26 bucks for 2.2 lbs. The price here is way to high. You can do better than this.
1,Very disappointing,"If there were a catagory for 0 stars, that's what I would have rated it. I bought this model only because I wanted a TV that would fit into a small space on a kitchen counter. The radio works, the CD works, but the TV died after l month. And the TV was the only part I was interested in. What kind of product is this? I would like Amazon to pick up this item and issue me a credit. Carol Gruber"
2,nice but problems,"The first CD-TV152 that I received produced no sound with TV. It was returned. The replacement produces no sound within seconds of starting the CD player. I cannot keep carrying these to UPS for return, and will need to buy some other CD player."
3,Not what I expected,I thought this was a regular puzzle where the whole animal was the puzzle piece to go back in its place. Turns out it's just the tails. So I guess it's good because the tails fit in any spot.
2,Other puzzles are better,"We have several Melissa and Doug puzzles, and this one is definitely our least favorite. If you're looking for a puzzle where all the pieces fit in all the places, I recommend the fish puzzle with different colors over this one."
3,"Nice toy, but too easy for 2 year old",I love Melissa and Doug puzzles but this one is way to easy for a 2 year old. It doesn't hold my grand daughter's attention for very long. In fact she deliberately puts the pieces in the wrong place. Just not challenging enough. maybe for under 2 years old.
3,Not a bad little puzzle.,"It was easy for my two year old, so I really liked it. But mostly she just throws the pieces around and makes a huge mess. I'm thinking maybe they are too simple."
2,Martha's point,This product did nothing for me as far as energy or nothing else.It did make me nauseated from time to time.I think I will try the tablets and see how they work.
5,Cool Pool!,My husband and I are in our late 40's and just wanted a way to cool off this summer. This pool is so comfy for our old bones. We love the padded bottom feature! (Never seen this before) It is very easy to blow up and holds the air and water well. We are delighted to have found this pool. It keeps us cool and young.
2,"NICE POOL, NOT WELL BUILT","The pool looks nice and is decent size but upon inflating for the first time, I discovered one leak and am aware of a second leak that I cannot yet locate. Since I can't find the second leak, I fill it, it deflates, and my daughter cannot use the pool. Very frustrating. I've tried contacting customer service from Target, but I get referred to Amazon, and no help has come."
3,pool review,it's a nice pool..a pain in the ass to blow up without a pump but oh well. lol it's a good tuy over all to have and holds a lot of water. it's just hard to dump it all out once you're finished..that drain hole should be on the side and NOT on the bottom of the pool.
1,"Never able to use, it popped the first week!","I bought this pool in April. Set it up the end of May and the first day it was warm enough to use, it got a huge hole in the bottom and deflated. We never did use the pool. What a shame. I hope I can return it."
3,No drain plug!,"I love the padded bottom, see-through sides, and deep walls.But there is NO drain plug, which is why we went with this pool in the first place. Very disappointing."
5,great toddler pool,"I just bought this inflatable pool for my 23 month-old daughter and she absolutely loves it. It was a cinch to inflate with the Intex 110-120 Volt A/C Quick Fill Electric Pump I bought to go with it. It inflated completely in under 10 minutes. The pool seems quite durable, as a matter of fact, my husband got in it with her yesterday and the two of them were splashing around for about an hour. The only drawback I see is that the drainage hole is at the bottom of the pool, so when it is filled with water, I am not able to lift the side of the pool enough by myself to let the water drain out. That is either a two person job or a job for one person strong enough to lift the side of the pool."
2,Tansgressive cinema from 1970,"Transgressive cinema from 1970, variously banned and criticised for years after initial release. The acting, staging and photography (B&W) show some age, resembling prehistoric reality TV- unsanitised, unwashed and at times just plain distasteful.The film is notable for its innovation, including the use of ""speech bubbles"" and a unique and often humourous score. The issue with showing generally unappealing and uninteresting people is that the film is similarly imbued with the same character. The scenes of 70's Paris are however great fun.Watching this leaves a strange taste in the mouth, like eating cake and forgetting to remove the cardboard base, or finding a hair in your mother-in-law's moussaka."
3,Pretty good.,This is a good adaptation from book to movie.Some of the scenes could be a little longer.Some scenes are stimulating.
4,Eros rules,"I had seen this movie a year ago, and my impression was that France's air was completely being substituted with a scent of Eros, which to my personal acquaintance in situ was not so at all.Black and white picture leaves none indifferent to a screening.Surely, yes."
3,"Interesting, but visibly one-sided","Yeltsin's memoirs are without doubt interesting and necessary source for everybody who's looking to understand what really has happened in Russia during 90s. But unfortunately this is only half or even less of that what Yeltsin really could tell us. First of all, this is not of course Yeltsin who has written this book. Real authors are Valentin Yumashev, who is also author of Yeltsin's previous memoirs, and Tatyana Dyatchenko, Yeltsin's daugther. Reading this book you could find almost in every chapter how authors had tried to save Yeltsin's face for history. They succeeded if reader is not well informed about Russia. But for them who have lived this through, Yeltsin's book is too one-sided and not really trustful piece."
3,I'm glad this is the last season,"There are definitely a few laugh out loud parts, but this is not ""The Office"" we all know and love. The show has been going downhill since Steve Carrell left, so I'm glad this is the last season."
2,The Office Sails into Snark Infested Waters,"Season 8 producers spent its entire season jumping a shark named Robert California. During Season 9 they may be trying to become relevant again. But what this relevance has amounted to, through 2/14's episode ""Moving On"", is this: ""The Office"" has become a nighttime soap. Call it ""Desperate Salesmen,"" ""Scranton's Landing"" or ""Slough Place."" There's just too much reliance on gimmicks: Too many cliff-hangers, too many red herrings, too many new characters and too much of those smack of stunt casting. It's all snarking, all the time. And most fatally: The show's producers have cruised for two seasons on its previous seven seasons of fans' goodwill. If you want a great sitcom series to watch, view ""The Office"" Season 1 through Season 7's episode ""Goodbye, Michael."" Seasons 8 & 9--not so much. ""Office"" producers, so much to answer for!The Office: Season Nine"
2,Which show am I watching?,"Ok I can't even believe this is what ""The Office"" has come down to. When I'm watching it, I feel like I'm watching a completely different show-that is not even related to The Office! Some new characters are added which I think subtract from the show, if anything. And none of the old characters are even slightly funny anymore! Something else that is really annoying, is that they don't pair together the funniest characters. They have Jim in another STATE (and it's extremely boring) and Andy is away for half the season. I couldn't even get a laugh if I tried. Besides that, even the stories are boring."
5,The Office final season goes out with a bang,"Really sad to see The Office close up shop. This has been such a funny series. I am glad, however, that Season 9 is seeing the series out the right way. Some loose ends are getting tied up, and the characters are free to act a little crazier than in the past. Andy's appearances have been few and far between as the season goes on. Episode 11 ""Suit Warehouse"" is probably the funniest episode of the series."
1,Please have mercy and kill this show.,"Every episode not only manages to disgrace this brand name but actually make seasons 1 through 5 worse, somehow. After seeing this season, I want to forget about the entire series and that's a shame, I recall truly enjoying the awkward Michael seasons. As for the actor who plays Andy, his absence at least made the show tolerable. Upon his return in this episode thoughts of blinding myself and bursting my eardrums became preferable to finishing the episode with his talentless non-portrayal of a character that has no aspirations beyond being overlooked, unfortunately thanks to the horrific brand of ""look-at-me-I-didn't-get-enough-love-from-mommy-as-a-child"" acting, we can not simply ignore Andy. Never underestimate the ambitions of individuals for attention and money to ruin art. Please cancel it now, we don't need an ending or series finale to this any more than we need a resolution to any rotting roadkill corpse in the middle of the interstate."
4,DVD-Audio presentation is GREAT,"This may be the best (in my opinion) that Sanborn has sounded in years. He is maturing and his playing is showing signs of this maturation. The video that accompanies the DVD-AUDIO music is pretty rotten...VERY bad video and occasionally pointless. But if you love his music and love surround-sound, this is definitely one of the better recordings to get. Unlike some DVD-Audio discs out there, the bass is not jacked up so loud as to cause ear bleeding. It is a very natural and cohesive sound. Too bad this format has died with nothing to replace it."
3,Husbands,This is a resource book intended to help those needing counseling. It was recommended and will be an asset to my library.
5,Great book that will truely effect you!,This book is securly found in its precepts. It is perfect for every marriage. If you truely read this book you can only advance into a better husband and thus a better marriage.
5,Expensive but if you want it get it,I heard this cd at a friend's house and I Was totally in love with it at first! It has a lot to offer.
4,Che dolce livro!,"Vincent Cardinale is a writer with an eye for detail, an ear for dialog and a heart for his characters. I first read the on-line version of this book over a year ago and declined to review it, thinking the writing was a bit heavy-handed. Yet it has stayed with me and I have thought about the characters almost every day since then! I bought the print edition, reread it and found myself smiling at the characters, savoring the details and reading the poetry out loud-in Italian. So ""Life of My Life"" is not the next ""War and Peace"" but is a sweet, easy read that addresses the turning points in love relationships. It gently reminds the reader that growth does not happen without struggle and that with faith, love and family-all things are possible!"
4,Overall great product,"The Mac Mini works great as a simple desktop solution. It was very easy to setup and worked with all of my existing PC components without issue. I was also surprised by it finding and installing my older printer (Epson Stylus Photo 825) and camera, although that speaks more for the MAC OS than the Mac Mini itself.My only minor gripes is that the system is sometimes slow with only 1 GB RAM and a slow hard drive. I also get annoyed b/c it takes a while to find my wireless network everytime it ""wakes up"" from going into hybernation mode."
5,So what if it's obsolete? It tames Lion like a champ-with extra RAM and HD,"Obsolete is what you make of it. If you are not able to do what you want to do anymore with any given product, then it is time to let it go. However, since I am working on learning Lion's differences from Snow Leopard, I bought a 1.83GHz/1GB/80GB/Combo drive mini that had been upgraded to 4GB RAM and 500GB HD, and it's every bit as capable as a MacBook MB063LL/A I also own and easily capable of running Lion for a wide variety of tasks.Yes, this ye olde mini can't run Mountain Lion, and neither can it's higher-end sibling the MB139LL/A. But Lion, if you can find a mini of the MB138LL/A or MB139LL/A model running it, it can provide an awesome introduction to Mac OS X now almost as well as it could back in the day.Go get this mini if you can afford to spend $400 on a Lion-powered entrance to a new method of computing. (Anything older than Lion is not fully recommended in 2013."
1,Don't upgrade to Leopard!,"I bought this just after Leopard was announced and also bought the upgrade DVD. After upgrading to Leopard I could no longer log in to make changes, but I could use the computer. After a two hour call to Apple Tech Support I could no longer use the computer and they wanted me to re-install the OS and NOT transfer my old settings.Search around and you will see this is a known bug that Apple could have warned people about or made a fix for before it screws up the computer. Apple still refuses to take responsibility. Avoid Apple products unless you don't plan to upgrade."
1,Mac Mini - Good Buy,"Excellent product. Replaces an older version of the Mac Mini. This one is much faster and was purchased as a replacement for the older version mainly because of the newer operating system. Got $250 for the old unit. Amazon shipped this very quickly and it was received without any ""hint"" of damage - just as expected."
4,Buy the new Mac Mini instead!!!,"Unless your strapped for cash ... there's really no point in saving a $100 when you can get the newer Mac Mini which put this model to shame.The newer Mac Mini for $599 comes with a faster processor, big hard drive, more RAM (supports up to 4GB), a Super Drive, and better onboard graphics. There's really no point in buying such an inferior computer just to save $100 ... now if it was $200 cheaper ... then yes ... but a $100 savings ... PLEASE!!!"
3,Why get this when you can get an Imac for less?,"While the mac mini is a great little computer, the fact is you can canget an Imac with more features overall for less money.MacMini for $749 comes with 1 GB RAM, 120 GB Hard drive, Super drive, and 2.0 Core Duo processor.An Imac at $1194 gives you 2.0 Core Duo, 1 GB of RAM, and super drive. It also includes a 250 GB hard drive, built-in isight, keyboard and mouse.To make the systems equivalent you would need to buy:either replace internal drive to bring up 250 GB or add external 120 GB drive ($90)add 20 inch widescreen monitor - $250add Apple Keyboard and Mouse - $90add webcam - $75brings your total to $1299 for a similarly configured Mac Mini.My money is on the iMac."
2,Nice idea but don't hold heat,I like the idea behind this product - 90 seconds in the microwave and it's good to go. Comes out very hot but the heat seems to last for less than 10 minutes.Would not recommend this product.
4,"Easy way to use ""wet heat"" for muscles and aches.","I was very impressed with this pad. It actually supplies a wet heat, the kind that is so much more effective and penetrating when you have muscle pain and other types of aches but needs no water whatsoever. Somehow the beads inside really do heat up and feel moist making a really big difference in it's effectiveness for tight muscles and more.. It works so much better than all the other seed, reheatable pads I have, so I actually do not use them anymore even though they did hold heat quite a bit longer. The texture and feel is soft and conforting as welll."
4,Pretty Good BUT........,Its a nice compact size which means it will fit onto all sorts of sore places like the neck or wrist that are awkward with bigger heating pads. The down side--there always is isn't there--is that it doesn't seem to hold the heat that long compared to other pads I have owned.
3,moist heat relief,"Heats up well and easily in the microwave, definitely moist heat and very soothing. Unfortunately it could be a bit more pliable. When leaning back on it it is rather hard and uncomfortable. Just to place it on a spot and it's fine."
2,Guess I don't like moist heat,"I read the positive reviews on this item, so decided to give it a try. I've always used dry heat, but not for any reason, just because that's what I found in the stores. I have an upper back/shoulder pain that's recurring.The heating pad worked as described, heated up just fine and stayed warm for a decent amount of time. I would not be happy having to reheat it as often as it needs to be done, though. But I really don't like the feeling of moisture along with the warmth. It made my hair damp when I put it on my neck. It made my shirt damp when I put it on my back. Guess I shouldn't fault the heating pad for doing it's job, but I really didn't like it."
4,Love it!,This is a fantastic product! It doesnt stay heated as long as it describes. But it still gets the job done.
3,Ok,Warms up nicely and stays hot and moist for a long time. The issue I have is the size of the sections make it so all the filling will shift around leaving part of your back not getting heat.
5,Long heat as advertised.,"Does the job and feels so good (not uncomfortable/ sticky feeling) on the skin! The heat does not wear out fast, indeed."
2,Doesn't last - poor quality,Had this pad & it exploded in the microwave. Sent it back to amazon & got a replacement. No wthe replacement did the same thing and the return window ended last week. Spend money on something else - this is a defective item.
5,Great product!,"Purchased this item from a pharmacy first and it worked so well my sister wanted one too, so I ordered one for her from amazon. She was so happy as it not only works well but is easily transportable. If anyone is having any aches and pains this is the product for you. All you need is a microwave and your set. Just order from Amazon and it's hassle free."
3,Its ok,"I recently purchased this heating pad because I messed up my shoulder really bad. The pad pretty much molded around the shoulder. When taking out of the microwave (1 and 1/2 minutes) it is really hot when applied to injury. I recommend using a towel around it instead of the ""cover"" that is sent with it. That being said, I found that the heat doent last long enough for me. Usually within 15 to 20 minutes it is cold. It feels great when warm, I just wish it would last longer."
4,Great Product,I love the fact that I can pop it in the microwave for heat and in the freezer for cold. Great size but might not be big enough for your back. The pack stays pretty warm/cold for a long time. Great value.
5,Just what we were looking for,"Our son is battling cancer and experiences a great deal of pain in his hips and lower back. We wanted a heating pad that was not electric. His older heating pad was filled with grain, which began to smoulder after so many times in the microwave. The comforting, moist heat of this heating pad along with the price met our requirements exactly."
5,"SO, SO WONDERFUL!!","This is one of THEE best things I own, no question. It works beautifully for even the most stubborn of headaches and body aches. I HIGHLY recommend it!!!!!!"
5,Moist Heating Pad,Definitely does what it says it will do. Easy to use. Can use as both warm or cold as promised. Should be in everyone's armemenntarium of muscle soreness aids.
3,Great FYI Book,"This is a great informative book on the Meru tribe of Kenya. It is written for a younger audience in mind and would probably be best suited in an Elementary School Library. I would say that the information in the book is great for children as it is enough to peak their interest, short enough to read easily (with big type), and enough to satisfy their curiousity. For people more serious in their pursuit of the Meru, I'd say stay away and get some of the books on the Meru by Jeffrey A. Fadiman."
4,A recommended read,"I liked the way Stone and Brewster broke the book into small, interesting chapters. It made for an easy read. I felt like I had a good sense of Weill's character and business style by the end of the book. The only criticism I would make is that the book seemed like an ""authorized"" biography in that it was overly flattering of Weill at times - like commending him for his restraint in only having three large mansions. Also, like all biographies written during the person life, there needs to be more chapters for events that take place after the book stops. In spite of that, I recommend the book to anyone who likes good biographies of business leaders."
1,.01 for this book used is .01 too much !,Sandy Weill is a modern day Citizen Kane complete with no friends and now a Napa Valley Xanadu to go with it.It is obvious now that all his deals were smoke and mirrors with taxpayers left holding the bag.The final chapter has yet to be written on Mr. Weill. The end of him should be fascinating.
4,Weill rules!,"From his humble beginning, Weill has done everything from a runner to a billionaire! Winning the power struggle against Robinson, Dimon, and Reed, makes Weill the king.Now that the US Justice Dept is examining the roles that Citigroup played in Enron, Worldcom and other collapsing companies, the story is not over yet.It is a must read for any CEO!"
5,A Talent for Deals and Recognizing Value.....,"I've just started reading this book and it is most certainly a good buy. The businesswoman in me loves Weill's ability to recognize value where others fail to see it (don't all the great ones have this unique characteristic?); the future wife in me admires his dedication, love and adoration of his spouse, a true confidante and partner in every sense of the word. I really enjoy reading about powerful men who are not afraid of telling the world how much of an intellectual and mental impact their wives are. More later...."
3,Okay,This book was helpful in showing examples of how to map curriculum. I could use it in the future to help me plan lessons better.
3,"Not precise, but great for estimation","This product is great for estimating lengths for painting, drywall, and flooring. The tool is easy to use and the built in calculations (area and volume) are very useful. This tool is by no means a replacement for your tape measure though. It is not at all precise. When I tested the tool I found that it rounded to the nearest inch, rendering it useless for any type of real measurements for things like cutting.Another fact is it must be pointed at a large flat surface for the sound waves to travel back to the machine and produce a measurement. Any kind of measurement done near an opening has a high probability of being wrong, because the sound goes right out the opening.If you are someone who is looking for a tool that can quickly ESTIMATE length, area and volume this is the tool for you, but if you are looking for something to replace your tape measure with that will still make very accurate measurements, I would suggest looking elsewhere."
4,Great gadget for the price,This is a good simple product if you need to measure overall rooms a lot. The accuracy is within an inch or less mostly.
1,Don't waste your time,"... this ""gadget"" simply doesn't work. I had to return it after several attempts to get an accurate reading that never occurred."
1,not what we ordered,Ordered a 50 yard roll and got a 6 yard roll. Called and was told they will send a 50yard roll. Later was told they won't send it but we could send back the original for credit.
5,About Spectrum Concerts,"Spectrum Concerts Berlin is that city's premier chamber organization, giving six to eight concerts annually to consistent acclaim. They are a youthful ensemble with that exceptional listening that only the best chamber music achieves. Janine Jansen, the first-chair violin, has just burst onto the US concerto circuit, and her Four Seasons is a smash e-hit, but she is being acknowledged for the completeness of her musicianship. Spectrum's work as a group is at the same level."
3,Good,"I am conflicted as I write this review. I have just read the kindle version (no longer available on Amazon I gather). The digital version appeared to have few, if any, defects (which is in STARK contrast to the many other offerings on Kindle I have read).This is an interesting book, on an interesting topic. However, it is not ""my"" kind of sci-fi, which centers more on the awe of discovery. This book, clearly focused inwards, as opposed to outer space and awe of discovery, was very good, but just never really moved me. To be honest, I only completed it because I am on a plan to complete reading all of the Hugo and Nebula award nominees/winners.I mention all of this, as your mileage may vary. Well written and interesting subject matter. Just never connected for me. But, if the subjects of slavery, individual right, caste disparities, and how we as a race view/deal with them, are of interest to you then this could be the book for you."
3,where's the beef,"My first time using it, the chain was too short for what I needed. Second time it served it's purpose. Comparing to older versions of same thing, the handle seems to be not as beefy."
4,"Yeah, boy","Much more realistic than Guzo this story of two brothers explores boundaries of family loyalty while blood, sex and death were following.Not a new plot at all of a bond between brother-detective and a brother-surgeon-turned-body-parts-merchant has been presented with a twist as a handsome knife-obsessed young Chinese man bored with his master-a mafia ringleader milks the bonks around.Surely, movie-makers know their country better."
5,Gripping and Definitive,"This read truly merits a five-star rating. It is gripping in its appeal, yet definitive in in its content. Great stuff!J. G. Wingate"
4,A mesmerizing thriller,I just couldn't put this book down. I went to bed reading it and woke up reading it. It was mesmerizing.
3,Unique Story,"A woman who went through it now spends her time defending others so they don't have to. Strong. Courageous. Caring. Is recruited into something she questions once getting involved. This question is her down fall as it starts to spiral the rest of the events in the book.The book brings together many different people and shows a real web of how nice appearance people can be not so nice guys. It contains fear, love, hate, question, curiosity, crime, drugs, lose and hope.A captivating read."
5,Dark Side of Valor,"I recently listened to an interview with Alicia. Her books sounded very interesting. So I read the book in one sitting. I could not put it down. I wanted to see how it ended.I think it was a masterful job and a delight to read. Moments of terror, moments of anger and moments of love, I mean love not sex, and put together in such a way you cheered for all the main characters.I hope Alicia continues to write. I would encourage anyone who likes adventure and action to read The Dark Side of Valor."
1,Manual wind alarm clock,"The replacement clock was worse than the original one that was shipped! The second one would only run ten to fifteen minutes, then stop. There was NO on or off alarm button. I'm sorry but I just don't think the Chinese should be in this type of business."
3,It is OK,It is a cute clock reminding me of clocks many years ago. It is not too easy for me to wind and I have not figured out how to make the alarm go off. It also tips over easily. I would recommend to look around a bit for a better quality. Spend a bit more 'cause you get what you pay for!
4,Wake up!,"I bought this as a gift for a friend who struggles to wake up to standard alarms. She finds it easy to use, plenty loud enough for a 4am wake up, and the ticking isn't overly disturbing."
1,Wind up Clock,"Will not keep time, don't know why,,,have turn up the speed on the back still not a good Clock to buy,would never buy this brand again."
2,Difficult to wind and the time speeds up a few minutes a day.,"I was looking for a clock to function if batteries were not an option. I had a wind up throughout my child hood, so this is not something unfamiliar. The wind key is positioned between two of the setting keys that make winding a bit of a problem. That aside, I find that the time speeds up a few minutes a day. I have set it aside after dutifully maintaining it for about a month in the hopes that I will never have a need to use it."
3,Not Bad for the Price,"The clock was inexpensive so I can't complain that it is not so well made. It seems to work OK ....runs a little fast, but there is a button to adjust that. I just haven't gotten around to doing that yet. Also, it isn't easy to wind. It looks good, so if that's important to you it's worth the price. The delivery was on time and as expected. All in all, it was worth it as I only want this clock for times when the power is out and I need to get up early!"
3,Good classic Celtic,"I bought based on a clip and a review. Was pleased, though the recording is 10 years old. I may check into their newer stuff, if it exists."
3,ironman m-fidl/ indline/decline bench,The bench is good the leg attachment is a little cheap and flimsy. I use the bench without the leg/ curl attachments. The preacher curl attachment is great and the bench is good. I may have bought another bench though had I know the leg attachment was not so great. But it took 2 hrs to put together ...so it is mine now.
1,Gross book,This book is gross. It had a substance spilled all over the pages and smelled like cigs. The book was soiled and stained and very poor quality.
4,"Great American Scandals, no trivia here.","Anyone interested in history will enjoy this read. The format is done in short tales of often little know information. Some is not new to history buffs, but there are some interesting tidbits that put a different perspective on what you thought you knew. It is enjoyable and easy to read. I highly recommend it and this author who seems to enjoy his research and sharing what he has learned with the reader. I am an avid reader of history and I especially enjoy the trivia and little known snipets of information these types of books relay. This book has not disappointed."
3,An Enjoyable Romp...not a lot of depth...,"There are a lot of good stories here. I enjoyed many. The book covers some well-travel ground (Burr v. Hamilton, Salem, McCarthy, Hoover, etc.). Nevertheless, there are some pleasures to be found here...many of the stories are terrific. I enjoyed the passages on the lesser known assassinations and the cruel campaigns a good deal. As often happens with these collections, there is not a lot of depth. It is fun read and I will use it in my history class. For those looking for an in-depth version of history, this is not the place to look. However, it is a fun overview and an important reminder that as much as things change...they have really haven't, we just have bigger TVs now."
2,American Scandals ?,If you are really looking for salacious scandals this book is not it. For any student of history most of this book is just a rehash of already well-known tales. Kept hoping it would get better -----
2,Not dirty enough. Skip this book.,"Just like the European version, this one is also filtered and edited for PG rating.Not as entertaining as it seems. Move on to another book. This one isn't worth your time and money."
4,Some great American stories,"This is a much better book than Farquhar's earlier effort 'Great Royal Sandals', it contains far more interesting and less well known (tro me anyway) stories. There are many intersting anecdotes that I'd never heard before. The chapter on the Salem Witch Hunts is particularly interesting, and it is cheering to learn that John Alden, the son of Priscilla Mullins, defied the judges at the trial so sturdily, and even more splendidly succeeded in escaping from their clutches. Equally fascinating is the chapter on Benjamin Franklin, and his scandalous treatment of his son, who unlike his traitor father, remained loyal to his King. Unlike some other reviewers, I do not find this book particularly funny, for funny history you want to read Will Cuppy or Sellar and Yeatman, but it is full of interesting information."
5,great dvd,"I highly recommend this DVD. It is exactly what I was looking for - I am an amateur who wanted to learn a few moves for my spouse. She teaches in the very easy to follow manner, shows how to combined a few moves, and shows a complete dance at the end.Also, it is a nice workout as well"
3,Not worth buying unless you're a professional stripper,"I bought this thinking I would learn some cute moves to surprise my husband.When I started the video I expected it to run like a workout video, (instructor will show the move and then let the viewer practice a few times before moving on) I had to pause after every move. I realized I wouldn't be practicing many of the moves b/c my TV room has carpet. I would have needed a large hardwood floor to do things like the caterpillar. These moves would look great if you were up on a stage. They don't look so hot if your husband is sitting in a chair watching you squirm around on the floor. Also the instructor shows you a variety of moves but doesn't show you a step by step routine. There are routines done with music at a fast pace at the end of the DVD. Not bad but... I didn't learn anything that I could surprise my husband with.."
5,So much better than the original,"I absolutley love this DVD. As they state, it is three products in one: instruction, performance examples, and an interactive DVD-ROM. The models are very tasteful, the music is appropriate....but the DVD still has a sexy edge to it that I find very compelling to watch. This is my all time favorite how-to exotic dance DVD."
4,Shake it!,"Pro: The moves are all very straight-forward and well explained and executed. It may seem like a low-budget throw-away (Alright, so it is sort of low budget ;P ) but it makes a great stepping stone up into more complicated dance routines. Plus, it has little nuggets like the performance enhancement videos- I can't wait to use that one on a live audience!Con: The blonde might be a dude, the Goth chick is incredibly awkward (Perhaps the stripper video equivilent of the token fatty in an exercise video?) and Angi has a regretable tendency to speak in a sleepy monotone."
1,Someone wake me up!,"The cover is the most exciting part of this DVD. It's all downhill from there. Some good basic moves to pick up but not enough to make watching the uninspiring, unimaginitive lessons. Even the 2 following in the back look in need of a shot of expresso. Bland, unattractive sets, black yoga pants and tanks, even the 'demo routines' meant to give ideas & spark your wild side are lackluster at best. While I wasn't expecting feather boas and twirling pasties, I was hoping for a fun, sassy, idea producing DVD. If these gals were professional 'strippers/dancers', they'd be a hungry, poorly tipped group. Sorry ladies..."
2,DONT BUY IT,ok for first time instructional dvd but seen all these moves before. Nothing new. Just wished i didn't pay that much for it. It wasn't worth it. I'll stick with my Flirty Girl Fitness DVD. Any suggestions on some really Advanced or more realistic moves? Can't seem to find any good ones. Don't want to take another risk.
5,Wow!,"I've heard about this book recently. To me is the best book I've read in the last 20 years. If you love history and religion and you would like to know more about mankind evolution, cause you think there is something unclear or maybe hidden, this book is a must. Be open-minded and have fun!"
4,Comments on the 12th Planet,"The book provided some insight on the perplexing question of where, how and when did man come from? It is a unique interpretation of civilization that merits consideration."
3,Washable Filter,The product is flimsy and the metal ring is bent when the item arrived. I took a chance and bought it without knowing much specification on it. I don't know its ratings but it seems like it doesn't work as well.
2,The Folks Back Home,"Two households in a quaint New Hampshire village experience yuletide joy in the 1880's when the handmade Christmas cards of the minister's wife are published and circulated nationally. This simple tale of family loss will appeal less to gradeschool children, since the main characters are all adults.This slender book spirits us gently back to a simpler time, as two village prodigals have been gone for three years, leaving gossip and grief behind--not to mention a minister sorrowing over his rogue son and a sister with orphan twins to raise. This is a quiet, short read for a snowy evening. Makes us wonder what it is about a Christmas card which we find attractive enough to buy and send it--the verse or the picture. Someone had to design it, thus sharing a little bit of their own heart."
4,"Cup of tea, quilt or fire place and this story= nice relaxing evening","Sweet Christmas story from the 1880's. This heartwarming story deals with family problems, heartache and the nosey, crabby neighbor and yet is an uplifting happy tale. A good reminder to use your talents/passions; you never know what way you may be able to change the world in little or big ways. If you like historical romances this is worth the read. Merry Christmas."
2,The romance of a Christmas card by Kate Douglas Smith wiggin,"A short story full of old fashioned homespun advice. This novella allows us an insight into a bygone era and attempts to capture the essence of Christmas, however falls short in characterization. The themes approached are similar to those explored in ' little women' . This is no ' persuasion. ,but is full of well meaning sentiment and has some charm."
5,Great Xmas Story,"This was a very tender, uplifting story to be read before the holidays. A story that you could let your teen read."
3,Good Book,If you don't like modern books then you will like this. Published in the early 1900's it is written with the style of the times.
2,Just not me,"I'm sorry to say that I found this particular story a very difficult read, I didn't even finish the book before I sent it to my archives."
3,romance of christmas card,I think the story was little short.I did not like the ending. The romance of christmas card. I would not reccommend it.
3,What kind of a Christmas Card would you write?,Interesting story reminded me of a story I had read before.The idea of the Christmas Card was a good one. Read to find out the ending.
2,"Lovely operating system, otherwise bad quality","Even though this is a discontinued product I'm so upset with my experience with it I'd like to warn any potential buyers. The power adapter on this just went up in smoke one day when I picked up the laptop to move it. I mean, literally went up in smoke - sparks, the whole deal. I called Apple and they gave me the names of two stores where I could find replacements - neither of these stores really carried a replacement. I looked all over - no luck. Finally bought a third-party power adapter, the only thing available in this good sized town, which broke off in my laptop and destroyed it. Yuck. Very disappointed - I've never owned a Windows computer that is as shoddy as the supposedly high-quality Apple. I mean - a power adapter that spontaneously combusts?"
4,Interesting and tasty snack,"I just got back from Japan and these were one of my favorite snacks. At first, I thought they were pine cones. They are little bamboo shoots. I liked the cookie and the chocolate combination. One drawback for me--the TV ads for this product are racist."
4,Holds Heat...But Doesn't Hold Up!,"These packs are great to microwave and use when heat is needed, especially on your lower back after a long day! They hold the heat a very long time. The drawback is that they tend to blister and burst with repeated use. Even if they are not overheated in the microwave, they do not last very long. It seems like one area will always get very hot and blister the plastic pac, while another area is still cold. I still purchase them, as I have not found a better product, but the plastic bag that holds the heating ""goop"" could be thicker to prevent blistering."
5,A great find,I couldn't find anything close to this in stores. I was replacing one I had had for years. I was very relieved to find it here.
1,Pack busted,Pack worked fine for two days and then it got busted while heating. I have been heating it for the same amount of time as instructed every time. Very disappointing.
4,multiple injuries,"The item is easy to use and I can use it on my shoulder, elbow, or knee. I throw it in the freezer with the cover still on it and can use it in a couple of hours. The cover is good in that the cold still comes thru enough and chills sufficiently. Cost and delivery very good."
2,hot cold pad,not really as i thought it would be. i have had much better for a cheaper price. i would not ever purchase this product again. if a person is a little large it will not fit them.
1,Pak busted on First Use,I heated the the pad to the directions and it burst the first time I used it. So very disappointed.
1,Smart temp hot/cold pad,"We had previously purchased this product at Medic Drug store in 2004 and it served us well until late 2012. The instructions gave a heating time of 4 minutes for the larger pad. We would microwave it for 4 minutes and the pad held the heat for a couple of hours. Ultimately, the pad had some leakage, so we discarded and ordered the product through amazon. The new model instructions give a heating time of 2 minutes, which we followed. The pad is obviously not as warm as the previous model and does not hold heat as long. After a couple of weeks of usage, the new model began to leak, so we had to discard it. We haven't called the manufacturer about it. Very unhappy with the ""new and improved"" version."
1,LOW BUDJET AND BAD MOVIE !,"THE ""NIGHT OF THE CLOWN"" is a low-budjet film and the music BY: REBECCA TORRELLAS is VERRY VERRY BAD! Lisa Cook is a bad actress and the serie SCREAMTIME FILMS is bad to !"
2,not what i thought.....,"This book is not as I thought it would be. I was looking for resources to add to a children's church curriculem I was making for my church. These books (old and new testament) only give one idea for a particular bible passage. And honestly, I haven't used any of the ideas. Each lesson is either a service project, a party, a game, or a worship experience, or a song, and just one of those is not enough for a children's church lesson. They are either too complicated or too simple, or just not right for teaching children a particular lesson. I'll be honest, save your money and you'll probably be able to make up stuff that's even better and more creative than this book."
2,Family Film,"Alec to the rescue is a substandard movie that is great for kids to watch alone or with their parents. The situations are pretty predictable and their is little to no plot in the entire movie. The acting itself was below standard, but if you get around that you can watch the movie for the scenery. All that adds to why it is the perfect family film. This is also why this film got two stars from me."
3,ALEC TO THE RESCUE,"THE MOVIE WAS GOOD TO WATCH AND WAS WRITTEN WELL. ALTHOUGH THEY PLACED TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON THE SCAM ARTIST WHO ALWAYS WANTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIM. WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PICKING THE CAST, DID A GOOD JOB WITH THE MAIN PLAYER, BUT COULD HAVE DONE MUCH, MUCH BETTER WITH SOMEONE ELSE PLAYING THE SCAM ARTIST. WISH THERE WAS A SEQUEL TO THIS MOVIE, WITH THE MAIN STAR PLAYING ONCE AGAIN. BUT WITHOUT THIS PARTICULAR SCAM ARTIST THOUGH."
5,Visions of Happiness.,The best by far massage DVD that teaches the enjoyment and benefits of massage.Very beautifully filmed. Outstanding music. Beautiful cast. Wonderful voice over.You will be proud to share the benefits of The Magic of Massage with yourpartner.
2,Burns Eyes!! Great smell,"I am a big fan of their food so I bought a bottle of this when I ran out of my California Baby super Sensitive body wash. My 4 yr and 2 yr old started screaming and crying saying that it was burning their eyes. Please be careful with your babies. It does say ""For external use only"". Smells wonderful"
2,partisan romance,A clever tale hampered by a protagonist who - though fully experiencing the fruits and flavors of a mythical world - breaks the narrative with often jarring revelations of her Republican political bias. Things get theologically tangled as she deals with problem of vampire/human fetuses.
4,Good Entertainment,"I just finished Goddess by Mistake and I thought it was terrific! The characters are enjoyable and Shannon seems quite genuine and very real in her struggle to adapt to a completely new world. This book has humor, sorrow, adventure, and romance and I liked it...It is not meant as a treatise on mythology and is a wonderful, entertaining book. I am keeping it on my personal best shelf and will happily buy other books by this author."
1,"""STUPID...SILLY...WASTE OF TIME...","Phew! What a stinker! Goddess by Mistake by P.C. Cast was a major disappointment to me! Waste of my time and money! Where do some of these writer's get their ego's fresh out of print from?The story per se had a good idea going for a quick minute, but just as quickly lost it! Maybe in time the writer (s) will improve their new-found writing skills, but to have their friend's compare this writer (s) to LACKEY??? Get Real!The characters in this story in all fairness were okay as far as this type of genre goes, but the dialogue and the plot left a lot to be desired and the editor shood be shot!..."
2,Blah!,These are just romance novels disquised as fantasy and not even good romance. I'm also sorry to say this is the best one. Don't bother with them they're junk.
4,Ignore any of the negative reviews,"This book was fun. It was easy to read, the characters were beyond interesting and the story was great.I think that if there are 27 good reviews and 2 bad ones, it goes to show you that some people just have to be contrary. But that's just MY opinion... so try the book, it's a blast!"
5,You Won't Want to Put it Down,"This is a great book, one you won't want to put down once you've started.I don't understand the negative reviews. Seems some men just don't want to know what goes on inside a woman's mind!I thoroughly enjoyed it. Am eagerly awaiting the next one."
1,I Bought 'Goddess' By Mistake,"I didn't realize I was buying a Harlequin Romance type book.As a fantasy and myth aficionado, I will pretty much readanything in the genre but this book is not of the genre.The write-up makes it sound so much better than it is(and in the right hands, could have been.)Can't even recommend it for a beach-read.Boring, trite, poorly written. A total yawn.I didn't bother passing the books on to friends,I would have been too embarrassed to let anyoneknow I had read such tripe.This one went straight into the trashcan.I am going to try to remember Cast's name, though, justso I never buy anything written by him/her again."
2,"Sorry...Liked the premise, but just couldn't cut it!","I really wanted to like this book! I honestly did! But, it was just too silly for me to finish. I'm sorry to say.Author P.C. Cast had invited me to buy, read, and review ""Goddess by Mistake,"" I'm sorry but your book was just not my cup of tea!Maybe your next book?"
2,Doesn't mimic real antlers in my opinion,Have had no luck with the rattle bag so I upgraded to a synthetic hand held set of rattling antlers. They sound more like the real thing and actually worked.
1,Totally worthless,"I tried to use this program to visualize some proposed renovations to my home - and gave up in frustration before I could even enter the existing first floor. This program lives in some weird fantasy world where kitchen cabinets only come in a few allowable sizes, windows are all custom made, stairs decide their own rise rate, and pocket doors are never placed in walls with other intersecting walls (to name a few). I'll be starting from scratch with another software package... What a huge waste of time."
3,interesting but.....not great !,"I Have been following Jason Lindner carrier for awhile and I do like his sound but can't really pick up the right cd. Anything I pick is just ok, but never great. This I thought was a great project and it is somehow...but his playing is very uneven, he goes into a great solo...then he looses you. It sounds more like an unfinished project to me. And please Jason, next time live you melodica at home, what an awful sound!"
4,"Fun, clean, cozy, a cuddle up afternoon book! Mystery!","I've really enjoyed taking a break from all the reading I do and just unwinding, (no pun inteneded), with these charming stories of murder, clean romance, knitting, good recipes, and friendship! This book also encourages those that have always wanted to try to knit to be brave and press on.. I especailly liked the recipes for food! LOL!"
4,Cozy and Enjoyable!,"The second entry into the series was as enjoyable as the first. As a fairly new knitter, its fun to follow along with Kelly as she learns to knit and discovers all the wonderful knitting fibers out there. All the information about Alpacas and fleece & spinning is quite enjoyable as well. Kelly's life is teasingly drawn out, but I love this because it leaves me wanting more. I love that the mystery involves characters set in situations that are different than I have read about before. Can't wait for the third one!~"
4,Knitting Mystery Series,This is a settle down with a cup of tea and an afghan cozy mystery. I like the details of the knitting and the yarn shop. It's a very good read for ladies who work with yarn.
3,It was ooooooookaaaaaaay buuuuuuuut,"I got very tired of the author's over use of the drawn out vowel. OOOOOkay, weeeeeeeeeell. It seemed a rather unnecessary device used to indicate hesitation, excitement, enthusiasm on the part of the speaker. Surely there was a better way to do this. And Kelly needs to get a life--she is still way too excited to be 'running her hands through the new yarn.'The actual story was better than the first in the series but I still can't get all of the knitters straight. As a craft enthusiast myself I have a quibble with all of the craft setting mysteries. I know of no-one who spends time every day in their local craft store....maybe once a week at a class but no-one goes to the yarn shop or the card shop or the whatever shop every day."
4,A Good Read,This was a good read for me.I enjoyed the close knit friend and family atmosphere.Good to read a book with people caring and sharing.A very good buy from amazon.
2,My time would have been better spent knitting...,"As an avid knitter and an avid reader, this book really didn't satisfy either of my interests. I'm not dying--or dyeing (sorry for the cheesy, overused fiber pun!)--to read the next one in the series."
5,Alpacas and murder,"Kelly Flynn volunteers to take a group of knitting tourists to visit Vickie Claymore's alpaca farm. Unfortunately when they arrive, she discovered Vickie dead on her original hand-woven rug.Vickie's daughter Debbie hires Kelly to prepare financial documents for her mother's alpaca business for the attorney. As Kelly gets more involved in Vickie's business, she begins to dig deeper to find the killer.Can she unmask the murderer without putting herself in his/her sites?This is the second in this knitting mystery series. I have enjoyed both of them tremendously. I look forward to reading many more. The Colorado setting adds to the wonderful cozy mystery series. I really enjoy Kelly and the other women she knits with at the House of Lambspun. What a great cast of characters.I highly recommend this book and series."
3,Needled to Death,"The series by Maggie Sefton on kniting mystery stories are a fun read, especially for kniters. I have read the first one, Knit One, Kill Two, and just finished this one, Needled to Death. I think they get better as the series continues. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series."
4,Buy this candy!,"This package is a great way to try a few different types of candies. The choclate marbles are like m+ms, and the jellybeans are, well, jellybeans. The candy that makes this set stand out is the yogurt candy. It's the white one. I never knew it was supposed to be yogurt flavored, but it makes sense now...It's tangy and sweet and AWESOME! I buy these sets just for the yogurt candies when I go to the Asian market. They're grrrrrrrrrrrreat!"
5,Project is as described,"My father is a line dance teacher. His old mic system has problem when it goes too far from the receiver and got interfered easily. After receiving this 2000 Series, he says he can go very far and the voice remains stable and crystal clear. Money very well spent. 100% satisfy."
2,Shock because of the authour's poor religious knowledge,"As a writer who should be resposible to understand the reality of described things and people, even they are created. Kwan Ying Joss, the Goddess of Mercy, in all Chinese heart, is just like Virgin Mary to Catholic. How can you described that She was fall in love with a man? It's gone too far away from the Chinese novel ""Western Journeys"" either."
1,Please stop ruining Chinese culture!,"If you don't understand Chinese culture, don't pretend you do. Please, please stop ruining Chinese culture by adding something toooooooo americanized. I beg you to stop! As a Chinese, I feel angry about an american writer doing something so irresponsible and stupid."
1,A Disgrace,"I don't understand how this can be published. The entire story is a terrible humiliation of Chinese culture, a flawed and distorted representation that could only come out of a western mind. I don't understand, do people find this entertaining? The entire story reeks of Anti-Chinese propaganda. What author would have the nerve to take the Gun Yum, the Goddess of Mercy, and pair her with a human Caucasian? Is this a perpetuation of the stereotype that all Chinese women want a White man? This is analogous to portraying the Virgin Mary as a prostitute. And why is Confucius portrayed as an arrogant and feminine character? Why is insulting the Chinese culture so entertaining to the American people?I simply don't understand."
5,This album is one of the greatest pieces of work ever,This came out a while ago apparently and I don't know why it doesn't get any airtime in the states.
5,Must Read,"I believe that this book should be read by Christians every year or so as a reminder to what we are to be about. An up close look at the lives of missionaries to Papua New Guinea, then called Irian Jaya."
4,Arms of Kismet - well worth a listen,"Like a fine single malt whiskey, Mark Doyon keeps improving with age. Cutting Room Rug, AofK's second release, is a strong follow up to Eponymous (which you must check out). Doyon can truly turn a phrase and the production and vocals on this recording are top notch. ""Life Imitates"" and ""Pinnacle of Same"" should be on everyone's playlist. 4.5 stars and hoping for lots more good music from this band. When's the tour?"
2,Writer's imagination of the Houston Mass Murders,"Save your money! This is a quickly put together book that Gurwell failed to put litttle research into. He went so far as to quote people whom he never spoke to. In areas where he didn't the answers, he filled in the blanks. Sadly it could have been a good book.Another book will be on the market within the next year or so titled ""The Girl on the Torture Board - The Truth About the 1973 Houston Mass Murders"" by Rhonda Williams. This is written by the female survivor from the night Dean Corll was killed by Wayne Henley Jr., who was also friends with many of the victims. If you want to know what really happened, keep an eye out for it's release."
3,Just a guide,"Yes, I know from the description that the booklet would be a guide to the short story Harrison Bergeron, but I had held the dim hope that given the title and the price tag ($5.95 for 27 pages? Let's be a little less mercenary in future please.), a copy of the story would be included.Back in high school Harrison Bergeron was one of a number of dystopian short stories that were required reading which absolutely held me enrapt. The guide is a wonderful breakdown of the story, explaining different motivating elements and contributing factors - but it would benefit immensely from including the story."
2,Weird,This is a very erm.. odd story. I'm in 7th grade and we're doing this for junior great books. It is very confussing. Why would you want to be the same as everyone else? Also I'm supposed to be writing about the 'product' aren't I??? Well oh well. Troubling story.
5,Great scissors,These scissors are just super for cutting heavy canvas for my floorcloths ! And they arrived very quickly.
4,Hugo Race hits again!,"Another sensational record from Mr Race and the True Spirit. All the usual sounds are there, haunting and blusey, Hugo is one of the finest song-smiths ever to come out of Australia. A seamless combination of older songs and some newer works makes this an excellent introduction into the world of the True Spirit. A must for anyone with an interest in original and passionate music. Hugo tends to make albums that create a mood, not unlike a great film. This 'best of' album isn't your average hodge podge collection of songs, rather a carefully constructed and intelligent musical narrative."
4,First in the field,"This is a relatively new are in the field of medical management. I believe the authors deserve credit for bringing the problems of running the modern day operating room and its problems to light. At many anesthesia meetings, most notable that of the ASA, this area has become a legitamit area of study. While short on solutions, the book does identify many of the problems encountered when a manager attempts to run an OR. This is an interesting read for anyone interested in the area."
3,A Decent Start,Although this book is not a comprehensive review of the field it does serve as a reasonable primer to the field. It is more of use to a manager begining to work in the operating room enviorment rather than a seasoned veteran of the battles that rage in these venues. It serves as a good overview of problems that are likely to be encountered rather than as a comprehensice guide to solving the difficulties.The one very usefull piece of information is the discussion of leadership in the operating room mileau and how one person needs to be charged with the responsibility. All in all a good investment for the price.
5,Great Wrench,"I bought this wrench to replace an older one I have that has worn out. I bought my dad one of these for Fathers Day over 40 years ago. He carried it every day. I have it locked away and won't use it because of sentimental value. I actually think I paid less for this one than I did the one I bought for him. It makes me happy and brings back good memories every time I look at it. This is a good wrench to carry in your pocket and is useful for so many things, you won't know how you made it without one."
5,"Passing it on,...","After being introduced to these books in college, I also had to have them. Now that I'm teaching high school English, with a little censoring of language, my enthusiasm shows as they hear the story (and mystery) unfold. It makes them think, guess, hypothesize, get involved, even get angry! I left 35 ninth-graders speechless and hanging on every word!! Imagine that!!"
3,Men's Auto Fold Umbrella,Purchased it because I needed one to fit my computer bag. This works fine not as strong as i would like but serves it's purpose.
2,Totally crap umbrella,"I bought one brand new and three of the (let's call them) spindles wouldn't reach out, so I had basically 1/3 of an umbrella non-functioning. And I can't find how to return it and get it replaced as it claims a lifetime warranty. Stay away. Get a Tote-brand umbrella."
2,Not as advertised,The description of the item does not match the product you receive. The umbrella does not fold at the push of a buttom. It does open but doesn't close. Also tehre is no double.For the price it may be worth but please correct the product description.
4,"Off beat, strange at times, but it's worth watching","Miike is known for him graphic violence, strange sense of humor, and shocking imagry, but claymation and musical numbers?!This is strange movie told from the point of view of the little girl in the family and the story revoles around a the guest that stay(and die) at the quiet little inn they own. In about 4 or 5 different times the movie goes into claymation with live action infused too, it's odd but kind of funny in way. But don't let the claymation scare you the movie is accually toching in a way because it show the struggles of a family to strive and be happy in the world and as in real life it's not a very easy thing to do.So if your looking for something different and you have an open mind pick up this movie and other Miike films, you may just enjoy them."
4,Not what you would expect,"Especially not from Miike. So, after dealing with that...think The Japanese Jesus Christ Superstar..without Jesus. =) The story is simple..a family on hard times decided to pull together and start a bed and breakfast in a remote location where supposedly a new highway will be built. Alas...we see no sign of the road, but we do witness the deaths of numerous guests. I found the opening of the movie to be great, although I do wish that the little monster who stole the girls uvulva would of stayed for the entire film.If you can condition yourself going into this movie that yes, it really is a musical...then this movie won't let you down. It's just Miike, just a completely different side."
4,BIZZARE AND HILARIOUS,"A Japanese family starts a guest-house on the top of a hill but it seems to be jinxed -- all the guests who visit them have an unfortunate habit of dying. Dead bodies not being the best thing for business, the family has to come up with a creative way to hide the corposes. They choose to do this while singing along the mountains.The predicament is funny itself. But the story telling is uniquely impressive as it effortlessly switches between melancholy romance, adventure, horror, mystery, singing, dancing, flying, some interesting claymation with weird creatures, crooks impersonating members of the british royal family, and even a volcano. It's like watching several different threads of the movie simultaneously, but somehow Miike holds it all together.As typical of Japanese cinema, there's even a very positive moral to the story, making this bewildering mess quite a bit of fun to watch for the entire family. Get your hands on this hilarious film if you can."
5,a total trip!,"This film is absolutely extraordinary. I had seen Miike's Audition and very much liked it. I knew that he made several films a year and that he had worked across genres, but nothing prepared me for this!As I left the theater I looked around at my fellow theater goers and saw sly grins, chuckles, bemusement and head shaking. We had really been thru something,let me tell you! Strangers exchanged smiles and comments. the bizarre experience had forged a common bond. We had seen the Katakuris!.I could describe the story, but why bother...see it, it is bold, original, masterly, flawed and wonderful. I can guarantee you one thing, it's fresh and you won't be bored."
5,Great book for beginner knitters as for tweeens/ teens.,"Activities like knitting just are not being passed down from generation to generation any longer. So I had to sign my daughter and I up for a beggining knitters class which was not long enough - full of other students - so the teacher could not help everyone - so this book was a huge help for us. My daughter her friend and i can know knit, cast on single stick and ending the piece.I think more activities need to be passed down as they no longer have it in homemmaking classes. I think it depends on the parent if its important to them to introduce their children to these lost arts."
2,It was just ok,The graphics were bad and the plot stupid but the game was cheap. I got what I paid for.But if you are into this stuff go ahead.
3,Love the headset but beware compatibility issues,"My company has a lot of these and they work well, but the latest set I ordered don't work well with my Polycom IP550 phones, and even with the right cord (that's important too.) I'm not sure how to order the right ones."
5,Great Sound,Ordered as a replacement to existing Plantronics and the sound quality is great! Comfortable and mic seems to be excellent as well. Great value.
4,Quality Sound,This headset works well if you need an office headset. I'm a little dissatisfied with the binaural aspect of this headset. It's not very comfortable on both ears. I decided to go to a regular single ear headset instead.
4,Good quality - ehh value,"While the Plantronics brand is always a good quality product, it is a pain that one can not simply purchase a product that can plug into the phone without purchasing one or two additional cables except for a review by another Amazon customer, I would have not realized that. Good stuff but a bit pricey and one must make sure they get the proper accessories (raising the price of course)"
3,Plantronics headset....need instruction to set it up on my phone.,I can not figure how to set it up on my phone....do you have direction on getting it to work on the phone? If so please send me a copy.Thanks
4,Can You Hear Me Now?,"Before getting this headset, I was using my phone in ""speaker-phone"" mode which gets old fast. I chose this model because of the dual earpieces as it gives me a balanced feel. I have no idea why units like this cost so much as the build quality is on par with headsets you buy for gaming on your PC. At first the set was a little tight on the ears but after a few days they have ""molded"" themselves to my head. As with any headset, prolonged use causes different symptoms. Ears get hot, headband gets heavy on the top of your head, etc. Such things go with the turf. Customers have never complained that they can't hear me and I don't have to speak loud at all. Using with a Polycom VOIP phone with coiled cord."
4,My daughter loves this costume!,"I admit when I read the first review I was a little nervous. My daughter desperately wanted to be a spy this year for Halloween and this was the only costume that matched her idea of what a spy should look like. I must admit that I have been quite pleased. I didn't have any of the problems that the other poster had with threads. The plastic parts were cheap and the inserts were too big to fit into the costume without some alteration. Overall I thought it was pretty good quality. (except for the plastic which really isn't that crucial) I even had to (hand) wash it because when we were ""just trying it on"" it got dirty. I can't see it lasting for years, but it will certainly get us through Halloween and a decent amount of dress up play after."
1,R. House Trsry of Fav Love Poems,"I'd be happy as Punch to review this purchase from Amazon....that is to say, if it ever arrives! Almost perfect timing on your part since it was a month to-the-day yesterday that it was ordered.Oh, by the way ~ ~ ~ the one-star rating was only given because I was mandated to enter something in that area....nothing more than that!"
5,Good Book!,Excellent Product! Quick Service! Would definitely do Business with again! Product came just as described! Product had great photographs included in ad!
5,Happy Music!,Raymond McLain is a master of playful bluegrass music. His genius play of strings makes this CD a gem. I can't help but smile when listening to it!
5,huge fan!,Huge fan since season 1. It gets better each season! All the Characters play an important role. All characters should stay on until the very end.
4,NCIS 9th season,"I am adding to my other seasons, I have not viewed this DVD yet but it appears to be in great condition."
5,The very best television series is NCIS.,"The whole series is available at Amazon which is where you should buy all seasons to watch - Primetime Television at it's best. Gripping, exciting, fun, informative, everything you would ever want to watch in one program. The best series is NCIS."
3,As expected. Arrived in a timely fashion. A little too expesive.,"We have not actually viewed this dvd yet, but we expect that it will be similiar to the the other seasons that we have purchased."
5,Best DVD's,My husband loves NCIS and I have bought him every season for gifts. He was very happy to receive this 9th season for his collection.
3,NCIS: The Complete Ninth Season,This complete season is really exciting in everyway. It is full of action and adventure and surprises. It is worth getting. The only problem you have to watch for is that some of the CD's are courrupted and non-viewable. That is really frustrating.
5,Wonderful,These NCIS shows I purchase for my hubby. He can watch these things over and and over again. He is anxiously waiting for Season Ten.
5,exelent,"can only be 5star, actually i would rate it more. the best series ever. would recommend to everybody not to mis this addictive series. not one episode is remotely the same...!!! ENJOY"
4,Great DVD with Slight Glitch!,"Being a real fan of NCIS I was really excited to receive Season 9 to add to my collection. I played it several times without any problems. There is now a slight problem...I am unable to play ""The Tell"". It just freezes up. It doesn't warrant a replacement, though. I have really enjoyed the shows as well as the extras. I'm looking forward to ""Season 10""!"
5,Awesome!!,The best there ever was! NCIS is one of the best shows out there. I never miss it! You can't be without the 9th season in your collection.
4,NCIS just keeps getting better!,"If you like NCIS, this episode is a must see. Especially *before* you start watching season 10. Great cliff-hanger. You won't be disappointed."
5,NCIS biggest fan,"What is not to like about NCIS? I have watched all of my nine seasons so much, I could run almost all the lines of every episode!Can't wait for season ten to come out on DVD!"
4,Good show,"Great streaming options from amazon prime. Works well with NCIS, so sad netflix doesn't have them though. That would be amazing."
5,I LOVE this series,Another FINE year at the NCIS building! I am sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to find out how they will fix the ending!!!!!!
4,Not as exciting as the previous Series,"How come that Gibbs gets involved with a dame with short brown/grey hair ?? What happened regarding his love for redheads ?? The storyline in this series is more about the characters and less about the cases they usually solve. However, I'm not complaining because it's still better than most of the TV shows seen today."
4,great,got it in great time ... thanksit was in great shape just as advertised. will definitely deal with you again.
4,NCIS,Very user friendly and easy to find any episode you are looking for. Shows are also up to date unlike Netflix.
5,NCIS Season 9,"Loved it! The chemistry between Gibbs and Dr. Ryan is fantastic, watched it several times, I enjoyed how they previewed what previously happen before each new episode. Can't wait for new season to start on Sept. 25, who is coming back and who dies."
5,NCIS Season 9,"Love, love, love NCIS Season 9! NCIS Rocks! I own every season on DVD!!!!! The show's characters are what continues to drive this show to be so well written, episode after episode, season after season."
3,"Delivery great, manufacturers packaging not good","As far as the viewing I would of rated it higher, but some of the stubs that hold the DVDs in we're to little & several of the DVDs weren't secure. Luckily the DVDs weren't scratched up. But we still have to be careful to keep them in good condition. We will have to go buy some new covers to keep them in good shape. Other than that delivery was great showed up before original due date. I think anyone delivering should do what we do even when we buy DVDs in a store & shake the box to see if they are secure. It's one thing that they get loose while shipping but the stubs were so small that they had no chance of be secured. Not the deliverers fault but the manufacturers fault."
5,NCIS series.,I purchased this series for my brother. He loves the series and was very happy with it. He said he will buy more when they are available.
5,I love it!,"I love NCIS so of course it is 5 stars, Can't wait until the next season comes out so I can buy it."
5,Great Show,"This season of NCIS is an interesting one, with all kinds of things happening. Having all the shows together like this is wonderful, as we don't have to wait a week or more before we find out what happens next!"
5,NCIS Season 9,Was hoping to buy all nine seasons together but was not available in that type of group set at time of purchase.. a MUST have for the ultimate NCIS fan..
2,review of NCIS ninth season,I am extremely disappointed with the ninth season of NCIS. It contains many reruns from other seasons. Not at all what I expected and i am very unhappy.
1,Soap Opera,"This season is way too ""touchy feely"" for my tastes. New age Tony and reflective Jethro have turned what was once a clever, stimulating show into a soap opera. I am having a very hard time watching & hope things improve by the end, otherwise it's bye bye NCIS."
1,POORLY PACKED!!!!!!,Completely unacceptable!! Packaged in only a poorly padded envelope.When paying $18.95 for postage and PACKAGING it should be done properly.VERY UNHAPPY!!!!
4,great show,"love this show!! Mark Harmon is awsome, cute and a good actor to boot. Great cast of supporting actors as well."
5,Great Show,"Mark Harmon leads a cohesive group of actors - and let's admit it, the man has aged really well - sexiest man of 1986."
5,AWESOME,I recommend this season to everyone who watches NCIS. The value is great the quality is great and I cant wait for the next season to come out on DVD
5,Awesome Season!,This is a great series. Season 9 is another great season that leaves you wanting more. I think the show keeps getting better.
5,NCIS 9th Season,"I received the 9th. season of NCIS. I grabbed a coffee and plugged it into my DVD where I spent the whole afternoon watching each DVD. It is fantastic!! The feel each actor has of their character is incredibile. Then on the Tuesday, ya baby, the 10th. season! Yahoo!!! The whole gang is back. Love you Ducky!!"
5,NCIS: 9th Season,"NCIS 9th season presented great story lines and we got to know the characters better. The 200th episode was great. A lot of the Gibbs story lines were pulled together and made sense. I have all of the dvds of NCIS from Season 1, episode 1, to the present. The stories and characters keep getting stronger. I am a true fan of the show."
5,Adding it to the collection,I just ordered season 9 to add to my collection and I will be up to date on the series. I still need to get the two episodes from JAG though since I never watched that show. My favorite episode is still the season opener for Season 7 though when they (spoiler alert) rescue Ziva. I am very anxious to see the season 10 opener to see that everyone is okay (they all signed contracts so everyone will be back). Of course I knew this after watching the season finale for last year and freaking out when (spoiler alert) when Ducky has a heart attack on the beach (good thing he was still on the phone when it happened). Ducky is like everyone's surrogate grandfather and it's impossible not to love him.
4,Profounding,"This espisode was a little hard to follow at first, but very interesting. It gave you an inside look into Gibbs' mind, making him human. It was definitely worth downloading, if you are a true NCIS fan."
3,NCIS streaming video,"We enjoy watching NCIS on Amazons streaming video. No commercial breaks make it worth the price. However, intermittently the connection is lost and we have to reload the video...which sometimes hangs while connecting. Once we have reconnected we can resume where we left off, but it takes a few minutes to get back. Don't know if this is Amazon or Google TV (we have the Amazon Droid app installed), but it is annoying."
3,NCIS is great but the DVDs are poor quality,"Several of the DVDs would skip and we could not view large portions of the video. I love the NCIS series, but am disappointed with the quality of the DVDs."
5,Pure class!,"My wife and I are in our mid 40's and entertain almost every weekend during the summer. This machine is the perfect addition to our back yard pool oasis. Don't worry about quality, this unit is both sturdy and very classy. It will make fun drinks for everyone including slushees for the kids. We even use the ice shaver for fine ice to pack around oysters,clams and shrimp. Make sure to get the carry bag, for easy storage...."
1,Margeritaville Margerita Maker,"We were expecting the machine to make smooth, thick, slushy margertias but it failed to deliver. We have tried many different combinations of ice, mix and liquor but the result is always watery and chunky. A TREMENDOUS disappointment."
4,Fun,Brings a lot of fun to a party!Larger and heavier than I anticipated.I am anxious to try making other frozen drinks.
5,Margiritaville blender,"Well made and works great, used it at a party yesterday and it was a great hit. The best price found was on Amazon.com."
5,Margarita Machine,Good product for the money. Near bar quality margaritas. Easy to clean and not an ice hog.
5,THE NAVIGATOR!,"What a great machine! Makes PERFECT margaritas every time. It is virtually impossible to make a bad ""concoction"" with The Navigator!"
1,now useless,"I bought this blender and it only lasted 1.5 years. Now the blender no longer ""catches"" and spins to blend. It was worn down because it is only PLASTIC. I called the company for replacement parts, they don't make them. They do not cover the warrenty, it is over 1 year old. They do not stand by their product. It is now useless. $[...] in the garbage. Don't waste your money. get a good blender for [...] bucks and it'll last 10 years."
5,Love it Love it!!!,The Margaritaville Machine is wonderful! We even brought it to the beach when we went on vacation and used it everyday. We made margaritas and daiquiris for the adults and then we made smothies and non alcoholic drinks for the kids. Everyone loved it and the ice shaves perfect . Thanks for a great product we will get plenty of cool drinks during the summer.Shari
4,pretty cool for parties,"This is pretty cool for parties! Otherwise, you would have to be a big old alchol fiend to get it for home use. the blender jar is very large and makes a great deal. function: it works great. does what it is supposed to, takes you to a beach!"
4,Margaritaville DM1000,"The machine itself is fine. However, I am very disappointed that I did not get the ""Changes in Latitude Party Planner"" which was supposed to be inside the box. I want this item but do not know who to contact about getting it."
3,MARGARITAVILLE MIXER,WORKS GOOD FOR YOUR SELF BUT IF YOU ADD ANOTHER PERSON OR MORE THE UNIT BECOMES TOO SMALL WICH MEANS YOU'LL BE MAKING DRINKS CONSTANTLY.
1,Not worth it,"I bought this product for a party, and I was not impressed. I could only make 2-3 margaritas at a time, which was unfortunate since I had more guests than that. I spent most of the night at the margarita machine making drinks than entertaining guests. The machine itself was very noisy. The quality of the drinks was not any better than a blender.Its not worth the money."
1,Stop...Do not BUY this product without reading this review,"I bought this machine a month ago with so much excitement and anticipation. When it arrived, my husband and I immediately took it out and went to the store to get supplies to make a great Margarita. When we made the drink, it was horrible....instead of shaved ice as the advertisement states, it made balls of sleet and chunks of ice. The margarita's it made were not drinkable as they had an oily taste as well. We packed up the machine and wrote a letter to the president of company - Cooks Plus, Hilton Head, SC, and got pitiful customer service. He refused to stand behind the machine or take it back. After repeated phone calls it is now up to me to continue wasting my time by other means to try to get my money back for a product that totally does not work. I highly recommend that you do not buy this machine and if you do, it is not through this resource of Amazon."
3,A small minus,I was disappointed to find that it did not come with the salsa dispenser I had heard about. You're supposed to pour it in the top and it comes out the bottom.
2,Margaritaville Frozen Concoction Maker,"I only used it once but I was not impressed. It shaves the ice very well, however we never got the right ratio of ice to alcohol. The drinks were very week. You could not increase the amount of liquid in the picture because then the ice will make it overflow. I did not try the recipe that comes with it. Like I said, I only used it once, next time I will try the recipe and see if it works better. I used premixed margaritas and it did not turn out at all!!"
5,PJ at UptownFlamingo.com says ...,"This item definitely lived up to our expectations! It is easy to use, fast and will be a fun addition to our pool parties this summer. Making a Pina Colada or a Margarita is simple and the machine makes the drink perfectly. The three drink maximum is not even a problem as it works so quickly, you can please any number of people in short time! The design is attractive and looks wonderful amid our assortment of tropical palm trees and, of course, pink flamingos!"
5,Hit of the Beach,"Just back from a week at Cape Hatteras with the crew. We have a total of 9 couples who have shared a house in Sept/Oct for many years now. This was the first true test of the Frozen Concoction Maker and it passed with flying colors. Probably had about a years worth of normal usage in a week and amazed everyone (and we are very serious about our margaritas - we even have a gas powered blender for making frozen drinks on the beach)Makes fabulous drinks, easy to use, and a snap to clean up. What more could you want. OK, one suggestion would be to be able to buy extra jars so that you can be pouring one while the next is in the machine. Other than that it was perfect."
3,This machine is not worth the price.,"This machine makes frozen drinks (e.g. margarita) only marginally better than a $40 blender. The problem is that it puts about 7-8 ounce water ice in each 12 ounce drink.With so little margarita mix and liquor in each drink, the drinks are very bland (almost tasteless). If you try to increase the concentration of the margarita mix/liquor, you lose the frozen consistency and have a cold liquid margarita which is not bad but you can get that with a regular blender. Save your money!"
1,good experiencce turned bad,I happily used my margarita maker for about 2 years then it broke due to faulty design. The piece that connects the motor to the wheel that turns the blender broke. And it can't be fixed.
1,Am I only one having trouble with this machine??,"I had just returned my machine for another one because it locks up after making only one batch of drinks. The shave only doesn't work at all! It worked the first time and will only blend the second time. No shaving of ice. How do i get this to stop! The machine will finally shave ice if i wait about 30-40 mins after using it once on the shave and blend setting. If I have a party and need to make six drinks, it would take me over an hour! Anyone have this problem and know what to do? There is no way i got two lemons in one week right???"
5,The Gift that Gives Back!,"This item was a gift for my son's new pool cabana, and from personal experience I can attest that the margaritas and pina coladas it makes are great!"
5,YUMMY!,This Margarita Maker is definitely worth the extra money! I could've spent $199 at Wal-Mart for the model just below this one and for just $3 more I got way more for my money! It makes yummy margarita's and daquiri's. I just put in the ingredients and it does the rest for me. And drinks never get water in them b/c their is a special drain in the back that puts the melted ice in a separate resevour. I pull out this machine at least once a week and love it more and more. So glad I made this purchase!
4,Frozen Concoction Maker,We bought this for an upcoming event plus we enjoy frozen drinks! The Frozen Concoction Maker works as advertised. We researched the machine and read one common complaint; alignment issue at the top of the picture top. This proved to be true. All other aspects work as advertised or better. Clean up is easy but be careful of the ice shaver blade during disassembly and reassembly.
5,Just love it,"Was hesitant to purchase because of price, but find the product makes exceptional drinks! Very pleased. Looking forward to using more this summer!"
5,hold onto your boots,Greatest drink machine you will ever buy.Watch out!--> what the machine does---can be addictive. It does not come with will power or self discipline as accessories!
4,Now That's a Good Margarita!,"Well - I finally broke down and purchased this frozen drink maker - and we LOVE it. Several years ago, we rented a commercial model for a party we had at our house. It was a big hit, so I thought I'd buy one. I was shocked at the price, however - about $1000 and up. I gave up.A few months ago, however, I saw this one and we broke down and purchased it after looking it over for way too long. Well - let me tell you, it makes very good frozen drinks. I mean very good. The drinks have a great texture (I was worried about ice chunks) and once I got the recipe down - a great tase. Still at about $250, it is expensive.Note that this unit doesnt make ice - you add ice to the top, the unit shaves the ice and adds it into the blender. Then the blender automatically runs and blends whatever ingredients you've added into a perfectly smooth and icey blend.So - at $250 it is expensive, but I think it is well worth it."
5,Makes a great frozen margarita!,"I am a connoisseur of the frozen margarita and this machine makes them just as well as any restaurant. When I make them at home I use tequila, triple sec, and fresh lime juice as I prefer not to use a mix. However, I have fond that this machine makes a margarita with a more frozen/slushy consistency when I use half ice and half frozen margarita mix instead of all ice. I then just add a few extra drops of tequila to get rid of that phony mix taste. I love this machine and would highly recommend it to any frozen cocktail lover."
5,WORTH THE MONEY,"After weeks of looking at reviews on this machine, I finally decided to buy one. I was hesitant and didnt want this to be like the prom. Where its hyped up so much that nothing could live up to it. Well I must say that I am so happy that i made this purchase. The machine makes frozen drinks just as well as most resturaunts. I love the manual ice shaver button, because it allows me to make my drinks really slushy! I am a 27 yrs old and loves a good party and to entertain friends and family at my house just about every weekend. This machine makes life so much easier. Be mindful that you will have to play with some recipes a few times to get the consistency that you want. I just got it on July 8th 2011 and I have used it everynight since then. The hubby and I have had some amazing nights :)!"
4,Margaritaville machine,Like most I was skeptical about this but after purchasing it was well worth the money. I am a little upset that after I bought it it went down 20 dollars but it was still worth the money. It is a little noisy but shaves ice very well to make restaurant quality drinks. Very well put together and very solid purchase with confidence.
4,Follow the Recipe,Great product. Just have to follow the directions for a great margarita or else you will end up with a weak icy one or a strong liquidy one!
4,yummy margaritas,"I ordered the Margaritaville DM1000 on Cyber Monday night. It was delivered on Weds afternoon! Talk about fast, thanks Amazon! I have used it once so far. It is very well made. The blades are very sharp. It is easy to use. It was supposed to come with a free party guide. It was missing. I phoned the manufacturer. It is being sent to me. I purchased this model as you can make drinks by the glass or by the pitcher. My drink was not quite the consistency I expected. It was thinner than the bar drinks I've had. Maybe all I need is practice. It will be fun to try!"
3,"Not totally wowed, it could be the kind of ice I used.","I've only used it twice so far. It does a good job, but in reading all the reviews before I expected a much finer grind on ice. Might be the ice I'm using from the refrigerator ice maker. Next party I'll be trying ice from a commercial ice company to see if that helps. But, on the plus side, it looks way cool!"
4,Typical for Architectural Monographs from Academy,"Projects and design of a French Art Nouveau architect illustrated by B&W and color photos, plans, sections, elevations, hard line axonometric views, hand sketches, and short text descriptions."
1,Talk about over rated!,"This book is highy over rated. I bought this book after seeing all the high reviews, and I was sadly disappointed. I had to force myself to finish this book simply to see if it would get better. It didn't.Georgia is so wrapped up in herself she claims to be unaware her daughter was being sexually molested by Georgia's ex-huband. What mother doesn't really know when something is wrong?"
3,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"The only reason I gave this book 3 stars is because amazon seems to not publish low ratings, and I deserve to be read, especially so I can warn all of you of this garbage of a book. All the reviews of this book are 5 stars, no doubt her and her friends because this book is pathetic. It is unreadable. Many people think their lives deserve a book to immortalize themselves; she is one of them. It is self-serving. BORING! The whole book is of her getting beat up by her boyfriend, cry us a river. She is an old washed up wanna-be ""model"" who is trying to hang on to something; youth or who knows what. I wish I could tell you how it ends, but I couldnt get that far."
5,Bravery,"Georgia has taken her diary and opened it to the world. It is more than admirable that she place herself on the line like this. Anyone can write a story, but it takes guts to live and then expose it to everyone. Bless you Georgia for taking courage to share your story with others and for being so open. You ARE a TRUE INSPIRATION THANK YOU!"
1,A psychiatrist's dream patient,"This woman could stay in therapy long enough to send a psychiatrist's kid through Harvard ! This poorly written book tells the story of a personality disordered woman who not only destroyed her life by living on the edge but those of her children. Domestic violence,abuse,life long friends who were sociopaths and she jumped from one ""wise guy"" to another in an effort for someone to take care of her!She would have been better off learning how to stand on her own 2 feet instead of some man taking care of her.Do not waste your time in buying this book,its a waste"
1,Gave Up,"Read 63 pages and gave up. So many books, so little time. Not bothering with any more of this one."
1,Save your money,"I would NOT recommend this book to my friends. Unless you like to hear one state over and over and over again just how beautiful she is and then read how she would let nothing, including her children, get in her way to fame and fortune, don't waste your time reading this. If you want to blame her problems on the company she keeps, then maybe one should ask why she never learned from her mistakes, but kept going from one dangerous relationship quickly into another. The book also seems to be poorly written."
5,A definite page-turner!,"What a good book! I really couldn't put it down! I had heard an interview with Georgia Durante on the radio and I learned from that interview that she would be signing books at a bookstore here in Dallas. I'm a BIG reader and the story she related during the radio interview hooked me! I tried to make it to the book signing, but...as luck would have it...I had to work late. I finally ordered her book and I couldn't put it down. I can relate to a lot of what Ms. Durante had to say, and I think that there are a lot of people (especially women) that will learn important life lessons from this book! I wish Ms. Durante much luck in all that she does! And...since I'm scheduled to take the TeamTexas Driving School at the Texas Motor Speedway in a couple of months, I'd love some driving advice!! :)"
4,Badly marketed GEM which extolls the value of SELF WORTH !,"The cover and marketing blurbs tend to undermine the true importance of this book. It is no more a story of the Mafia, East Coast gangsters and/or criminal activities (and Ms. Durante's role therein), than ""PRIVATE RYAN"" is a story of the role of the American soldier in WWII. Rather, Ms. Durante's book is an true example of the importance of SELF worth and how we make it work, or not work, for ourselves. Georgia Durante's amazing story of inner strength, and FAITH in herself, should encourage ALL of us to realize how capable we truly are."
3,I think she was foolish,"Sorry for those who admire her, but I thought she was a silly goose. I too was in an abusive relationship, but I didn't go back. She went back over and over. She didn't raiser her daughter, her parents did and then she seemed amazed that her daughter was into drugs. There were parts that I knew she was glossing over to shed a better light on herself. She partied her butt off, that's the bottom line. Now, she's older and wiser and trying to spin her story. I'm not buying 1/2 of what she says about how innocent she was."
5,triumph of spirit over abusive relationships,"Ms. Durante's book should be regarded as a ""must-read"" for every woman in our society. The book should be used as a standard textbook in every psychology class for its incisive detailing of how one can be drawn into an abusive relationship, recognition of it, and how to break the cycle of abuse. Ms. Durante chronicles in a ""no-holds-barred"", brutally candid way the price one can pay while involved in abusive relationships. Through her determination and strength of will and spirit, she demonstrates how she broke free of the abuse and began a new life as an independent and successful businesswoman. Bravo, Ms. Durante! for the courage to renew your life and the courage to come forward with your triumph detailed in a compelling, well-written book which has lessons in it for us all."
5,The Company She Keeps - Fascinating and inspiring!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Company She Keeps by Georgia Durante. The book is packed with chilling stories of struggle and abuse as well as incredible tales of courage and perseverance. Reading about Georgia's adventure-filled days of adolescence when life was good as a beautiful, young girl to suddenly, an abused woman trapped in a life of violence and uncertainty was indeed captivating. Fortunately, her unstoppable spirit helped her find the strength and courage it took to survive and become successful, silencing the disparagers.Georgia Durante is a heroine and her determination to survive and succeed is an inspiration to me. I am grateful Ms. Durante had the courage to share her harrowing stories and am thankful she has finally found the peace and happiness she rightfully deserves. Her story is worthy of being told on the big screen. The Company She Keeps is truly a fascinating and inspiring book."
5,The Company She Keeps,"Interesting....it sounds like the last review was a personal vendetta. It is easy to take pot shots at someone on line and especially when you do not identify yourself. Shame on you for attacking the author's mother and then to even stoop to criticize spelling, when in fact, you misspelled famous.The POINT of the book was to encourage other women to stand up for themselves and to escape from male domination and abuse. With determination and guts, this was accomplished against difficult and challenging odds. The book, as many other testimonials state, inspired others to overcome similar obstacles. To nit pick and attack the author indicates a narrow mind, that obviously missed the focus of the novel. Those that do, do....those that don't, criticize."
2,a exciting but drawn out life.,"I heard Georgia on a radio station talking about her life and the mob so i decided to buy her book. it started off very slow, mostly talking about herself and her accomplishments in stunt driving. I felt sorry for her in a way but she could of avoided everything if she only spoke up from the start. I would'nt say she was in the mob, she had very little ties with it. To me she hung around with people who wanted to be like the big dogs. As you read you think she would of got the hint with her first husband but she fell in love every minute through this book. if you like a long drawn out book that is predictable then this for you."
5,FASCINATING!!!!,This has got to be one of the most thrilling books I've read to date! I found this to be a great novel that grabbed my attention immediately and glued me to my chair as I turned the pages. Don't start this book at night because you won't get any sleep! You certainly will not be able to put the book down! I must say that I truly hope that Georgia Durante writes more!!!!!
5,The Company She Keeps,"I found this book very honest, exciting and interesting. Georgia Durante takes you along on her adventure and you will enjoy the ride."
4,"""The Company She Keeps""","I found Georgia's story most compelling, as I imagine any woman who had experienced abuse would. I also liked that it shows the ""mob"" for what they truly are, and not the glamorized version we often see on TV and in the movies. I'll look forward to reading the two new chapters in the latest release of the book, and to seeing the movie that is bound to eventually be made from this story sprinkled with all the elements that sell, beauty, famous people, violence and family dynamics."
5,The Company She Keeps,"Having lived in Rochester all my life, I recognized a lot of the names that Georgia wrote about, even remember her as the Kodak Summer Girl.Excellent read"
5,Glad I didn't marry in to the mob!,This is a brave book. I can't imagine going through some of the things the author went through and not have a heart attack from fear! My sister loved the book too!
5,"""WOW"" What an awesome read! Georgia's amazing","Since seeing Georgia on Montel, I ran out and immediately read her book. ""WOW"" is the words to describe how I felt after I read the book. What an amazing, strong woman Ms. Durante is. I couldn't imagine going through half of what she has been through and she is still alive to tell her story. Very inspiring for those who may be in similiar circumstances. Kudos to you Georgia and thank you for sharing your story with the rest of the world! I wish you and your family continued success!"
2,Way too Long,"This book could have been much shorter. She should have used a ghost writer too, because the writing wasn't very well done. There was some skipping around and when she started new subjects, there was no preparation, she just jumped into a whole new story. Some of this book is interesting, since most of us don't live this kind of lifestyle, however, after the first 10 chapters, I just kept wondering when it would end."
1,Just Another Breeding Bimbo!,"Save Your Money,Ever Read A Book & Think...""This Nonsense Goes On FOREVER!""?? well I'll Walk You Through It Right Here & Now.Georgia Was A Bit Too Fast & Thought She Was Just as Furious,But Her Choices Proved Her To Be Exceptionally Ignorant Of Real Life So What Does She Then Do??Start Having Kids To Pass The Bad Brain To!As She Jumped From Man-To-Man,Maniac Husbands Here & There,Then Acts Surprised When Her Daughter's FRIEND Tells Her That Her Ex Husband Has Been Molesting Her Daughter.I Guess Ol' Georgie Girl Was To Self Involved To Notice On Her Own.Save Your Money,I Had To Give It Something So It Got One Star-& I Even Want That Back!"
5,The Company She Keeps- G. Durante,What a spectacular book. Durante keeps you involved with her story and the evolution of her life. The worst part of the book is that it ends.
1,The book I don't keep!!,"Waste of time! Where do I begin?Georgia made bad choices aplenty and her kids paid the price.First off, she talked at length (and frequently) about how pretty she was and how many bookings she had. She flew here and there and was the kodak girl 60 years ago and blah blah blah. She's a gorgeous woman, I get it!And the mob? She knew some of the guys but I got the impression that she was just a pawn or some pretty thing that hung around. Oh, and the wife of one of the low ranking jealous/abusive mobsters.Finishing this book was more painful than getting whacked by Tony Soprano.My advice to her would be:**Get a fan-based website. Don't make people read a book full of name-dropping and self-promotion disguised as spiritual growth.**Beg and plead for her daughter's forgiveness for the early trauma that she was subjected to as a child and a teenager.**Never EVER write another book. Just stick to the website."
3,"Great story, poor e-book",I loved this book. It is as thrilling to read as a murder and mystery story. It is also chilling when you know it is true. One cannot imagine what Ms Durante (and some of her friends/family) went through. The book is really a testimony to the abuse and violence so many women faced and are still facing today.The downside of the book is the poor typing: I don't know the reason but sometimes up to 4 or 5 words per page are cut by a longish space making it awkward and unconfortable to read. Many times you have to return to the word to read it clearly. Better comes out as bet ter for instance.With a printed book you would bring it back to the bookshop and get a replacement....
5,I'm sorry It Ended!,"I am usually not a reader of books. I received this book as a gift. When I opened it, I truly didn't think I would read it in full. Well, was I surprised! This is one of the best books I have ever read! Ms. Durante is an inspiration to all women. She is a strong, determined woman who has been through more than most of us go through in a lifetime. I was sorry to see the pages coming to an end as I read, but I just couldn't put it down. You won't be sorry you read this book, it will stay with you for days, and with me forever!"
4,A True Survivor,"A model-turned getaway driver-turned abused mob wife-turned stuntdriver-turned women's activist hardly seems like a realistic plot, yet Georgia Durante has transformed her action-packed life into an autobiography that skids into the imagination with a brutal force. A mobster story that neither glamorizes nor condemns the underworld, The Company She Keeps is told from one extraordinary woman's perspective--it's a tale of one woman's ongoing courage that ultimately overcomes the evils surrounding her. So engulfing is the drama, you often forget you're reading a recount of someone's life and feel like you're in a made-for-the-masses saga. Georgia's writing is that of an everywoman--she speaks to her peers, embraces her shortcomings, and ultimately finds her happiness after a life-long search. The Company She Keeps is a truly inspiring story that encourages readers to relate to its strong-willed heroine. Georgia IS a true survivor!"
5,Absolutely spellbinding! Couldn't put it down!,"This book is one of my favorites, as is the author. We grew up in the same town, same atmosphere. Georgia had a determination that I have always admired and the book sure gave me an incentive to go after my dreams. Thanks, Georgia, in more ways than you will know!"
5,completely amazing!,"Georgia Durante has been through it all. Just when you think she has found her happy ending another curve ball has been thrown. I have never read a book like this, between corrupt cops, mobsters, crazy ex husbands, amazing friendships and hollywood stunts, this book has it all. Georgia has been through some hard times but has always managed to come out on top because of her attitude towards life and the love she has for her children. She is an inspiration to many and hopefully all the women who read this book who may be in a similar situation as Georgia, can follow in her footsteps. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. You will love it. I promise!"
5,A new definition for survival,"Woe, baby, you've come a long way. This is an incredable story of how one woman was able to survive deaths ugly face, not once, not twice, but several times. This is not only a fasinating read (written extremely well), but a storey with many lessons to be learned. It makes you really think. It's a look into the underworld from a whole different perpective that I found captivating. I sailed through 456 pages in two days and was sorry to see it end. Can't wait for this authors next book. She has a fan in me!"
2,The back of the book is false advertising,"The back of the book is false advertising. It leads one to believe the story is about a get-away driver for the Mob but in actuality it's about an egomaniacal woman who makes countless terrible decisions and doesn't learn from any of them; it's a long, drawn out chronical of her past relationships with men. The get-away driver parts are next to nil. If you want to indulge in a conversation with a woman who relied heavily on her parents to raise her daughter while she grew up in a bar and several marriages, this is for you. There are several other books on the Mafia that are better than this."
3,"""All The Bad Choices I Have Made""","Ordered this because my book club selected it. Loved being able to order it so cheap from Amazon. It was entertaining and I liked the pictures from her life. It was facinating, like watching a car wreck. And the kind of life that you kind of wonder, how does THAT happen? She had something bad happen that was out of her control, and then the rest of it was one bad choice after another compounding the first bad thing that wasn't her fault. I was so disapointed in the author's choices that I ended up not finished the book. I don't want to spoil the plot, but making mistakes on her own behalf was one thing, but making such mind-boggling mistakes on behalf of her daughter was unbelieveable. It made me so sad. Anyway, it was a very interesting portrayal of a model tangled up with the mob, so from that perspective, worth reading."
5,The Company She Keeps,"This intriguing novel was recommended to me by a friend and I am so glad he did. Georgia Durante's life was full of excitement and challenges. Her strength and determination are to be admired. Her story is uniqueand would be enjoyed by both men and women. It's amazing that Georgialived to tell this gripping story. The book is a real page turner.Our book club read, discussed and thoroughly enjoyed this book. We are hoping for a movie version."
5,The REAL deal...,An outstanding and riveting account of how the mob really works. A must read for a serious student of the inner workings of the underworld.
5,The heart of the matter.,I enjoyed this book very much. It's the kind of book that you don't put down until you finish it.Ms.Durante spoke of her experiences from her heart and soul. I could relate to what she was writting about because I knew the same type of people she did.
5,A Book I Did Not Want To Put Down,"If you are looking for a book that you can't put down and when you finish it you are wishing there was more, this is the book to read. Georgia Durante tells her fascinating life story that will inspire you in so many ways. Georgia Durante's story is truly amazing and that she is here to write her story is even more amazing. This is a book that I have and still can read over and over. I recommend this book for anyone to read."
5,Enthralled,"I purchased this book one day and read it all through the night, could not put it down. Great read!Riviting,exciting,one heck of a ride.Would recommend to anyone looking for a story about a women who overcame adversity."
5,A non-stop read,"I read this book in a day. I could not put it down. Through everything she came out completely inspiring! Though none of my ""lows"" were close to what she went through, there was a comfort in her voice throughout the book that made it feel like she was the familiar face next door. The warm friendly mentor that you could turn to in a time of need and get a hug or a kick in the ass, whichever you needed to get your life back on track.I will never forget the feelings I had reading this book. My boyfriend (and our cats) would stare at me oddly as I laughed out loud or burst into tears following her words. I truely hope she writes another book."
1,Very Bad Quality Product,"Very Bad Quality Product.It dissapointed me.The case doesn't fit the phone,and difficults its buttons access, bad finished quality ....The headset doesn't work..."
5,Captures essence of emerging church movement,"Kudos to Jim for a great book that captures the essence of the emerging church movement. Often times when we think emerging churches we think of candles, poetry, tattoos, and experiential worship. Future Church is a great read because it boils down the movement to the core transferrable principles. As a new church plant it was most encouraging to hear stories from other new emerging churches and their struggles. I say this is a must read for all church planters and pastors."
4,credentialed,"The author breeds and raises German Shepherds for guide dog and police work. Another book of hers, ""The Great New DOg Book"" won the Maxwell Medallion for Best General Reference Book of 1995 by the Dog Writers Association of America."
1,2 Cats Say No!,"Although I like the idea of this product, my cats hated it. One is very picky, so no surprise there, but the other eats anything! He was meowing and excited but when I put the bowl down he sniffed it and reared his head back and completely snubbed it. I can't tell you how shocked I was by his reaction. I ordered it direct from the company, so it wasn't spoiled. I have to give it 1 star because neither of my cats would touch it."
5,Grata y refrescante lectura,"Lenguaje sencillo, pero muy descriptivo. Cuentos cortos llenos de humor y de folclore caribeño. Como colombiana disfruté mucho con El Bembé de Teofilito y el relato y las peripecias de una ceremonia afro-cubana, También me emocionó Paloma Brava, con su transfondo de eventos ocurridos de la historia de Méjico y su inesperado final"
5,Variados temas,"Un excelente compendio de cuentos donde estan presentes el humor, el folclor y el costumbrismo. El autor demuestra su dominio del idioma, entregandonos varios cuentos narrados en primera, segunda y tercera persona. De entre todos me deleito la version ""rashomonica"" del cuento Tres Veces Pirindingo,en el que las aventuras del personaje principal son narradas desde tres distintas opticas."
5,I LOVE THIS CD!,"This CD is really worth hearing. The songs can be dedicated to different people in different ocasions (Boyfriend, ex, family member). Conjunto Primavera is my favorite gruop and I think that this is their best CD."
5,Necesito Decirte,"I love Conjunto Primavera's CD. My favorie songs on it are Sin Conocerte and Necesito Decirte. I reccomend this album to everyone. I love how he sings Necesito Decirte. ""Cadino, necesito decirte que mi mundo es muy triste desde que te perdi tu amor. Yo no se vivir. Que extrano tu mirar tu sonrisa y todas esas caricias. Que le diste mi alma amor con el corazon. Necesito Decirte que no voy a olvidarte aunque te fuiste porque solo soy de ti y para t"". Necesito Dercirte that this Conjunto Primavera album is GREAAT!"
5,I Love Conjunto Primavera Theyre the Bomb!,All of their Music Is great! I hope everything still goes good for them
4,Excellent!,"First heard of Black Rock on Seattle's C89.5 FM website. Excellent dance track... airey, danceable beats, and luscious vocals. CD Maxi single includes the video.I don't give out 5 stars unless I'm really impressed but you can't go wrong with this track."
5,Great player,"I love my NJB3. It's much better than its predecessor the NJB1. As long as you don't mind the relatively large size to other players (though it is still smaller than, say, a portable CD player), then there are many benefits including the fast transfer speed, long battery life, and large capacity for files. However, if you're thinking of buying one, check with the manufacturer for the correct list price...."
1,Failure to live up to potential.,"I have a 15,000 track, 23GB library of MP3 files. I got this thing yesterday and everything seemed to be going ok. However, after 10,054 files, the player neglects to write anything further to its hard drive. The controlling program on the computer, PlayCenter 3, shows that it is writing to the player but nothing is actually being written. I now have about 16,322MB of music on the drive. There is 21,811MB of free space! But the player won't use it! I was hoping that Creative would have gotten the bugs out of their product by now. I have a 20GB USB model from a couple of years ago that had similar problems as well as crashing itself, the USB port, and PlayCenter 2. It appears that they still haven't addressed their problems.If you read glowing recommendations about this product, they just haven't accumulated enough files yet. Their problems await the growth of their library. Absolutely cannot recommend this product!!"
5,My favorite MP3 player!!! It Rock's,"Hey, This MP3 player rocks. I also like the big price tag!!! I love expensive things! Any-how this Mp3 player really sounds and is Great !!!"
5,Perfect,"This is a great tea kettle. I use it all the time and sometimes leave water in it for a long time and it's never got rusty or faded. It's brightly colored and has a large capacity, but works great for just a little, too. The nice wide base really works well to heat the water up quickly."
1,not up to par,"After being shipped two of these tea pots, due to damage I would not want anyone else to order one. The pot itself is just what I wanted, contemporay, and large, but the quality associated with Pfaltzgraff was not there. They came chipped and pealing each time."
4,Beautifully haunting,"Robert Bly works hard. That should say it all, but I know you say: ""I need more.""In this collection of poems (and a single prose piece), Bly opens a world of the inner body, exposing it to the light of the reader, and exposing the reader to the harsh light of artistic lie/truth. This is Mother Earth, Earth Goddess, Woman Who Roars/Balances...Just a couple of his lines:As soon as the President finishes his press conference,black wings carry off the words,bits of flesh still clinging to them.The ministers lie, the professors lie, the television lies,the priests lie....These lies mean that the country wants to die.Lie after lie starts out into the prairie grass,like enormous caravans of Conestoga wagons...."
2,halley,Not helpful at all. The textbook just simply throws tons of mathematical equetions without any good explanation (at least not work for me). This complexity only makes all the stuff intangible. Don't waste your money on this book.
2,exposition but not explanation,"This book is almost useless if you don't know the mathematics and logic of structural equation modelling. Tragically if you know the mathematics and logic of structural equation modelling and seeking a deeper discussion this book would not help you either. Therefore it is hard to understand the target public and purpose of the author. In fact this book is a good application of a particular (and annoying) formula for pseudo-writing about mathematical concepts: whenever there is a need for rigour point out a reference, talk about concepts without any depth and without appealing to intuition and present computer outputs instead of solutions.You may wish to have this (kind of) book only if you want to have a kind of tourist guide for the realm of structural equation modelling."
3,Warm & Sincere,"This 13-year old folk CD combines some excellent elements. Winter has an expressive alto on her 4th CD release. She ranges from the Dorothy Fields/Jerome Kern ragtime opener ""A Fine Romance"" to the environmental jazz/blues ballad ""James Bay"" that boasts some sterling sax work by Billy Novick. The title track is belted out with some tasty blues riffs. ""House of the Rising Sun"" is given a bluesy dixieland treatment. ""Filter It Out"" is a sweet shuffle with an environmental topic, ""It's not a problem 'cause I've found a solution, I figured out how to deal with this pollution, a few hundred dollars for a filter on the sink & even in a nuclear war that water you can drink."" The set concludes with the pretty melody ""Short Moments."" Winter's traditional set is pleasant. The original melodies aren't overly memorable, but it has a sincerity that radiates warmth. Enjoy!"
5,Excellent,"Some rare Bach transcriptions and works here. The entire CD is fabulous, my favourite the BWV 596 concerto (Murdoch transcription),a rarely performed work, which is breathtaking!Definitely worth it."
5,TD Jakes outdid himself with this one. It's Great!,"The book really helps women look deep into there past, there present, and there future. It also helps you to achieve great balance in your life. It gives a very indepth and clear understanding of what role a women plays, in God's eyes. I appreciated the way the information that he wrote was backed up by scripture allowing you to see it in God's word as well as a writing by man. This was one of the best books I have EVER read since I became a Christian, 10 years ago. P.S. The tribute to his wife, located on the second page, was PHENOMINAL!"
5,Amazingly Insightful,"T.D Jakes has written a book that every woman should read. Each page gives tremendous insights into the needs of a woman. Quite surprising to me, was that it was written by a man. I believe though that he was inspired by God - the Creator of women.I have bought several copies to give to women I minister to from prison. There are golden nuggets within each page which will bring insight, love and healing to the reader. It's a good read for men, but may be a bit hard to understand all the emotion that is involved within it's pages.I cried often and when I finished the book, I felt loved by God."
5,"Review for The Lady, Her Lover, Her Lord","I thought this book was wonderful. T.D. Jakes is truly annointed by God. He touched the very essence of a woman's pain in this book. He got to the root of the past pain in women. This book touched me so deeply I cried when reading it. I couldn't put it down. Men don't be scared by the title, this book is for anyone who's ever had struggles, trials, troubles, or pain of any kind.--EVERYONE."
5,SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR ALL WOMEN AGE 13+,"T. D. Jakes opens your heart to all the Lord wants for us as women. This book is easy to read and his beautiful use of language heightens the wisdom he imparts with a constant flow of emotion. Being a two-time cancer survivor, divorcee, and recently turning 50, I had begun to let go of the notion that I would be blessed with new, rewarding, fulfilling experiences. Thank God a friend recommended this book. I now know that I am the Lord's Lady, that he has a Lover for me somewhere (and, if not, that's OK), and that my Lord has infinite blessings waiting to be uleashed. I look forward to working with my new ""tag team"" partner, Jesus, to let his Glory shine through my life. Ladies, its YOUR life, let Him use you and enjoy it!"
5,A must read for women striving to be the Proverbs 31 woman.,"This book was excellent. I couldn't put it down and read it in less than two days. I have never recommended a book to anyone, and I must say this book was excellent. I've never known a man to know a woman's perspective on things so well. He also added some advice so that we would be able to understand the men in our lives. I promise anyone who reads this book won't be disappointed."
3,Redundant....,"Everything you need to know is written in the first three chapters. A potentially good self-help book if that is where you are in your life. However, the author repeats himself quite often. For example, how many times does he use the twisted tree scenario?"
2,Don't let the low number of stars turn you off to this CD,"Ever since several performers from Hawaii came to the National Folklife Festival in East Lansing, MI several years ago, I have been longing to listen to well sung, traditional Hawaiian chanting/songs. This CD has it -- but only three or four tracks of it. If this were a record (LP) there would be hills and valleys on it by now. Slack key guitar makes me ill and I avoid those tracks like the plague, but the traditional chants are exceptionally well sung and make this CD one of the few that I return to over and over.Most of the other CDs that I have encountered having music of this type are either antropological or poorly sung or include the SKG (I don't want to even write it again). The few tracks on this CD that are of merit are worth playing over and over again."
2,Map doesn't match text,"I took my first walk today, taking one of the tours in the book, Greenwich Village. Although the book led me through a nice, interesting tour, it committed an unpardonable sin. At one point on the tour, the map did NOT match the textual guidance. It was only a few blocks off, but this is a mistake that should be caught prior to publishing."
1,security locking fuel cap,Could not get it to lock. Had to use the key to lock it. Requested a replacement and when received it was also defective.
5,the perfect locking gas cap,well this is a review of the locking gas cap i bought from a amazon seller and it works perfect and locks my gas pipe up tight so noone can get my gas and or put something in my tank as people have done before so this is a perfect locking gas cap and i recomend this to all my friends and family and co workers thank you for a perfect transaction and god bless all have a great day see yaaaa later........
2,Works but I have to fight it??..My wife cannot get it off,"I bought this for my Ford Ranger. The gas cap goes on fairly smooth...but getting it off usually is a struggle? I don't know why, just turn key to unlock and turn cap to the left and remove. Sometimes no problems...sometimes alot of problems. My wife has given up on it and I had to put the old non locking OEM back on. I don't know if I have a bad cap, but I sure don't want to get it stuck on and not be able to refuel??"
2,PROBLEMATIC AND NOT DURABLE,"This gas cap isn't made well enough to fall from the top of a gas pump station. I'm on my second one, because when it fell, the handle broke in half. No handle, no good. So be careful not to drop it, especially in cold weather. It's made of a cheap plastic. You don't expect a gas cap to break, even when it's dropped. If you can find one made of metal, it would be worth the extra money. Besides being made cheap, the key is diffcult to place in the slot. There is a metal cover that somehow has to move out of the way when you place the key in the slot. It can take several attempts before the key actually goes in the slot. I don't recommend this gas cap."
1,didn't fit as described,"amazon has a feature called, ""make sure it fits your vehicle"". It FAILED. i had to return this cap since it is the wrong one. i later looked at the reviews and found out i wasn't the only person to return this item for not fitting my vehicle."
5,Indispensable,"With a tankful of gas costing upwards of $60 (or $100-$200 if you have a big motorcoach etc), this gas cap pays for itself if it prevents one thief from stealing gas from you. From a mischievious standpoint it also protects your vehicle from someone putting something nasty in your gas tank.I found this product to be a perfect almost OEM replacement item. I found that I could reuse the plastic ring that kept my original gas cap tethered to my car - so the product looks like something straight out of the factory.It comes with two keys, which I just attached to each of my key rings.Overall, a great product, a simple invesment.On Amazon, I really enjoyed the make/model/year product finder that guided me to the right part - very helpful (thanks Amazon).Overall I can't say enough great things about this little product. I highly recommend it."
5,Nice,"No problems so far. I hadn't had a leak, and I feel safer with it on. Good quality and fast service."
4,Not 100% perfect but a good value.,"Pretty good value for the money. The key/lock sometimes a bit of fooling with but, overall, a decent product for the money."
1,Very odd tasting,I'm really surprised at the rave reviews on this cereal. I tried it this evening and found it to be just awful. I can only think 'cardboard' but it has a familiar taste that I can't recall right now. This would definitely have to be an acquired taste. Maybe it needs to be mixed with things. I added lots of sweetener as it didn't have any sweetness that I could tell and I wouldn't have been able to get it down otherwise. Looked for an expire date in case it was bad but didn't see one. Got mine at Whole Foods.
4,yummy healthy Cereal,"Honestly not much to say. the cereal is yummy, very crunchy, and it came exactly as I wanted. A big box with a bunch of little ones in it! great shipping. would order again for sure."
3,Thanks for the price increase!,"You just lost another long-term customer from a dedicated GF family. Was a pretty good GF cereal. There are other options now for GF cereal, though. Maybe I'll also start eating more fruit for breakfast."
5,Best cereal for an adult,"When diagnosed with Celiac Disease I really missed eating good tasting cereals. I tried a lot of other gluten free cereals and they were not filling, would get soggy, and often were so full of sweeteners, they even left my mouth feeling raw. Perky's Nutty Flax is awesome! It is filling, not too sweet, tastes great on yogurt or can be eaten alone. And it stays crunchy for a long time, an added bonus for a busy mom in the mornings. I highly recommend this cereal for anyone with Celiac Disese that used to love cereal. In fact, I need to start buying this in bulk since the rest of my family discovered it and loves it. I is so nice that my kids, who do not have Celiac Disease, eat a healthy cereal like this."
3,An acquired taste,This cereal is just ok. It is good if you want a very low sugar cereal but the pellets are so tiny. It has a slightly nutty flavor but at the same time it is pretty bland (low sugar). If you want no sweetness at all in your cereal you will like this. It tastes a little bit like grape nuts but not as dense. The way I eat it is mix it with other cereals to give an extra crunch.
5,Excellent fiber content. Great Taste. Good crunch.,"This is a fantastic cereal for gluten sensitive people. It not only tastes good--it also contains fiber, which is often lacking from other cereals suitable for people with gluten sensitivity. I hope this becomes available again soon!"
5,Love this cereal!,"I originally found this cereal at Whole Foods, but I'm going to buy it from Amazon now. I love the taste, shape & texture; and the fact that it stays crunchy and doesn't get soggy. I don't have food allergies. I just like it. I have to force myself to eat breakfast in the morning and I eat this with unsweetened soy milk and berries (blackberries, raspberries, and or blueberries). It's a delicious and satisfying breakfast and healthy too. At the top of my cereal list."
2,Yuck!,"I'm sorry to have to give this product such a bad review, but this cereal is disgusting! The taste is not good. I prefer Perky's Crunchy Rice Cereal, which is good. So you might just want to skip over this one and go for Perky's Crunchy Rice Cereal."
5,The Five Pennies,"Thank you Decca Records for the CD release of this great soundtrack. I have been waiting for 20 years,the record has been unavailable for years. I Give this CD 5 stars plus, if you are in to 1930'jazz this record is for you. Danny Kaye and Louis Armstrong are great the music is well recorded [1959]. I Hope a DVD is issued in the near future."
3,An OK Filter house tune,"Red Kult follows the trend of the Eric Prydz hit ""Call on Me"" by looping a phrase from an 80's song and making a disco-house club track. It's not bad, but not that great either. Personally I like Tina Ann's cover of ""All I Need Is a Miracle' on her album ""Situations"" much better.Similar songs - Cabin Crew - Star To Fall, Global Deejays - What A Feeling, Mylo - In My Arms."
1,Pump Just Died...,"Very dissappointed with the quality of this pump. It only lasted 1.5 seasons...(Also, in my location, pools are only in use for about 3 months per year.) For a pump that cost over $1,350 delivered and then the extra installation cost.... I would say it was an extremely unsatisfactory experience. I have been reading reviews on the web and it seems like my problem is not uncommon.The engery savings this pump gave might have covered the extra cost of it, but with only a 1 year warranty you take your chances that the extra $800 or more dollars you spend is worth it.I am a bit of a techie, but the menu to run this pump is not very intuitive. You might spend quite a bit of time pulling your hair out trying to figure out what settings you should use.You pays your money, you takes your chances. If it lasts longer than 2 full seasons, then you might have saved enough to cover the extra pump costs. My Hayward pump lasted over 8 yrs, but was not energy efficient...."
1,Don't waste your money,"This quite possibly has to be the worst mixtape I have ever seen. Headaches washed up behind needs to give it a rest. He should've stopped after and 1. Now he's doing other people's moves(skip,future) for money. There is no real gameplay here. Just some kids messing around and let him do what he wants to them. In closing the worst basketball dvd I've ever watched. Huge waste of money."
2,You can find better,"I -think- it made my hair softer and more pliable, but honestly? It wasn't a big enough difference to give it more than 2 stars. Difficult to spread, especially with thick hair. Just not worth the price for the amount you get.As a starting point for alternatives, try SheaMoisture Deep Treatment Masque instead, but sleep with it in your hair overnight instead of leaving in for 30 minutes."
1,Am glad I used the last of IT!!!,"The smell is most powerful when wet!!! I do not like the result given. Even after my hair felt moisturized the smell lingered. If you are not a FAN of avocados, PRESS the back button on your webpage..."
1,battery no good,"He loved the motorcycle, but the battery won't hold a charge, electricity goes through, so as long as it is plugged in, it goes, but take out the charger cord, and it has nothing. I got mine from Sears, and have to pay the postage to return it, hardly worth the hassle."
1,Don't Purchase It....Purchase It From A Store.,"The box was a mess when it arrived, including the styrofoam on the inside. The chrome was chipped and it is significantly smaller than you think. If you are lucky, your child can ride it until they are 4-5, not until they are seven as the box suggests. This is the type of toy you should see in a store so I do not recommend the online purchase. Our son is 3 1/2 and was deeply disappointed with the toy. To boot, there are fuses that were shot when the toy arrived and our son was never able to ride it. What a tremendous disappointment at Christmas."
4,Some headache getting it but a GOOD machine,"I don't know what had happend to this order. Usually Amazon is good with their shipping; however I odered this machine on the 24 of Aug. and recieved it on the 8th of Sep..The assembly came with some problem, the main shaft was bent and it did not allow me to place the mast inside, so I resorted to a hammer and pliers. After that everything was a breeze (it also helps if you have your own tools, it would make it a lot faster than those provided).When I finally got onto the machine, it was GREAT. I'm used to using a Precor machine at the gym, and this does not stand up to it; but for a home gym at a resonable price I'm definately glad I bought this. I have it on a level floor (that helps a lot) so it does not ""wobble"", the resistance is great, NEEDS a water bottle holder, few but effective programs, and it's quiet.I would recommend this to someone."
4,Study Guide Simplifies Understanding,"The study guide is a great help in grasoning the information from the text. Howver, it does take a little time to coordinate the textbook to the workbook."
1,Violence Against Minds and Bodies,"Bittersweet Passion is a deeply misanthropic work, in which sexual, emotional, and psychological abuse -- including rape and misogyny worthy of the Taliban -- masquerade as 'romance'. Although I am not particularly demonstrative, I began to weep in horror during the first rape scene. Then, the book worsened. It reads like a doctored account of spousal abuse, and by the time I finished, I was more seriously disturbed than I have been in years. Anyone experiencing what the heroine experiences would be expected to suffer from serious post-traumatic stress, but she, bewilderingly, doesn't seem to retain any long-term effects.I recommend this book only to people researching misconceptions about domestic violence. I strongly dissuade anyone looking for a decent work of fiction from touching Bittersweet Passion."
3,This one is quite hard to review,"This is one of those books written about one special aircraft that is beautifully done, with fantastic photos and copy, but just does not have a whole lot to tell that is interesting or holds you to your chair. The history of this aircraft is dull becuase it is such a good aircraft. It has had little go wrong, so it is really only a lot of facts and figures that you are left with. A great book for lovers of this aricraft, but little to hold you to the edge of your chair."
2,Volume not very good,"Not as good as I expected. Can hardly hear and the people at other end always ask me to speak up, which is annoying. The piece was not worth what I paid."
3,soundtracks,"This movie is my favorite western. I love the opening song in the movie, but I wish they had more of it on the cd. I also wish there were more instrumental selections. There were too many vocals. One thing that impressed me about the music, was the authentic sounding instruments that were used. I was happy to find this soundtrack because I've been looking for it for years."
4,Excellent soundtrack,"Great little album from an under-appreciated film. I first bought it on vinyl back in 1980 and played the hell out it. As the years passed, I was surprised to never see it in stores on CD. I'm certainly glad this import is available. Ry Cooder created a fine testament to 19th century American music."
4,Jack of Diamonds,"looking for Jack of Diamonds similar to version in The Long Riders.Drunken Hiccups(Hobart Smith, Tommy Jarrell).Rye Whiskey(Tex Ritter, Pete Seeger, Robert Byrd).Way Up On Clinch Mountain(J.W. Day (Jilson Setters)).If you search for Jack O' Diamonds, you will mostly find another song popularized by Blind Lemon Jefferson.I left this in a comment but realized people might not see it there."
3,"NICHOLAS RAY, OPUS 2","*** 1949. Directed by Nicholas Ray. A WOMAN'S SECRET's screenplay was an adaptation of Vicki Baum's Mortgage On Life written by Herman J. Mankiewicz. Maureen O'Hara confesses to the police that she's just shot Gloria Grahame but neither his friends neither Police Insp. Jim Fowler believe her. Nicholas Ray's second film is not as good as his first one THEY LIVE BY NIGHTThey Live by Night / Side Street (Film Noir Double Feature)but is still enjoyable. The most interesting idea of the film, apart of the flashback building, is the way Maureen O'Hara describes herself as Gloria Grahame's double. She lives through Gloria -Estrellita- Grahame since the day she lost her voice. Unsettling. If you own a multi zone DVD player, you can buy a DVD zone 2 of this film at Amazon.fr."
2,Not what was expected,This is not at all what was expected. This does not pop up in seconds like the description says. It is not the twist technology like all my other play hut items. It sets up with rods like a childs tent. Not impressed.
5,Pensamientos de Omar,"Como Pez En El Agua fue un cd muy fuerte para el Grupo Mojado y los felisito. Todas las cansiones me gustaron. Lo mejor para el Grupo Mojado en el futuro. QUE VIVA SIEMPRE EL GRUPO MOJADO Y ARRIVA MATAMOROS, TAMAULIPAS! 1"
2,'Thin Man' Wannabes,"This wasn't as good as advertised, at least in my opinion, bu it was still fairly entertaining. This movie was a ""Thin Man"" wannabe with a husband-and-wife team (Brian Aherene and Loretta Young, romancing, making smart remarks and solving a murder mystery.Some of the remarks might have been funny or clever 65 years ago but they appear dated and not as good today. And, all the ""darlings"" mouthed during the film got annoying. It sounds so affected nowadays.Except for Young, it wasn't a big-name cast but it was an interesting one with the always-mysterious Gale Sondegaard and Sidney Toler of Charlie Chan fame.Overall, it might have been ""A Night To Remember"" but it wasn't a movie to remember. However, you could do worse."
2,review of Destiny,"While the concepts behind the story are fabulous (and the reason I kept reading) the writing itself seems quite two dimensional, and the editing ... well - everything from punctuation to spelling errors to sentences that were written twice. Both this book and Redemption were difficult to read because of these issues. Such a shame - there was so much promise to the storyline!"
1,For completists only,"These new BG novels with Richard Hatch's name on them are awful. The plotlines are confused and the characters are unrecognizable. If not for the BG names (like Apollo and Baltar), you'd never know you were reading a BG story. It's like really bad fan fiction you can find on the web. This stuff is only for completist collectors who want to own every piece of BG-related merchandise ever produced."
1,"Save your money, doesnt work!","Doesn't eliminate any odrors. Just a waste of time and money. But then, I've tried many products in this catagory and not one of them can do what they claim."
3,A decent textbook,"A good book for basic knowledge on HVAC, but not so much for a reference book for those already working in the field. Shipping was prompt and the book was in new condition."
5,"Comprehensive, up-to-date, attractively printed",Unlike some textbooks which no one would buy unless they have to...this one is great if you're a technically-minded homeowner who wants to learn about your house's HVAC systems. It gives a lot of useful and well-presented information for the price. Also covers commercial systems.
5,THE HVAC TECH'S BIBLE,"THIS BOOK SHOULD BE CARRIED ALONGSIDE YOUR TOOLS...THE COMPANION CD-ROM THAT COMES WITH IT IS ALSO USEFUL AND VERY HELPFUL....IT IS UPDATED, AND PICTURES/DIAGRAMS ARE VERY CLEAR AND CONCISE...."
3,A Description,From Back Cover:Stunning young Lisa Thorpe had everything. Her father was rich and powerful. Her talent made her a world-class athlete. Her virtue led her into a convent and work for a charity hospital. But what was a lovely girl like her doing in a bedroom in a slease-bag East Bronx motel?She was lying dead in a pool of her own blood.And it was up to Detective Vince Crowley of the NYPD to uncover the ugliest secrets a beautiful girl ever left behind...
5,Fits great... Serves its purpose,Finally replaced our old ironing cover. Bought the silver coated cover which I think speeds up the ironing process since it appears to reflect the heat. Fits great. Nice and taut. No need for strap in middle.
1,Not suitable for ironing cotton or linen,"Beware - this product manages to collect, store and regurgitate moisture. It will produce wet spots on the clothes you are trying to iron. So you end up going back over the same area again and again to dry the fabric."
1,WRONG COLOR SENT,"When I came across the BOCA RATON STRIPE pad/cover, I was excited to order a fun pattern (as pictured with bold orange stripes). However, what I received was an altogether DIFFERENT brand (""Whitney Design"") in a TOTALLY DIFFERENT pattern (""April Stripe"", which is blue, yellow and green stripes). I went ahead and returned the pad/cover, requesting a replacement be issued in the correct color/style (BOCA RATON). AGAIN, I received the INCORRECT pattern in April Stripe (not even listed!). I can't speak to the other patterns offered, but if you're contemplating ordering the ""Boca Raton Stripe"" I would beware! The customer service person was rather apologetic, but I'm still out a cover/pad and have had the burden of making two trips to the post office to make the returns."
1,WRONG COLOR,"I ordered this product as shown in Flower Power. The picture is a pink/yellow color. This would work out well since I had just repainted my laundry room pink. However, when it arrived, it was BLUE!! The quality seemed fine and the price is great so I may try a different color. Here's hoping to the new one being correct!"
2,Damaged,Never used it. The foam underlayment was torn in two places when I opened it. I'll be sending it back.
2,This didn't fit my standard ironing board,I wish I still had time to return this!! It doesn't fit my standard sized board-it's just a little too short.
3,Padding a bit small.,"The color is okay, it fits my board fine but the padding is very small.Do not expect too much cushion from this iron board cover."
4,Just what I was looking for,"I had been using the same ironing board cover for 20 years. I used it that long because I liked it and couldn't find anything close to it. This cover is very close. The silcone coating was essential. The elastic band is a big improvement over the drawstring of my old cover. The only drawback is that the surface is not as slick so you really need to use two hands to reposition clothing as you iron. Lstly, I'm abit concerned about the strength of the seam on the tapered end of the cover - only time will tell. Good value overall."
4,Bliss? ironing board cover,"I ordered the color called ""Bliss"" which was blue with flowers but instead received ""Flower Power"" which is orange and green butterflies. Even the packaging it came in said ""Bliss"" on it. Weird. However, it fits perfectly on my board and is much better quality than what I had before. I like not having the drawstring."
3,Read the description closely,"Shame on me for not closely reading the description and instead, looking at the image of the items posted.The image shows a number of different calender cutouts...definitely more than the 11 that are shipped with this pack. If you read the item description, it tells you specifically which ones are being shipped. I guess I glossed over that one. I looked at the image and saw a number of different calender cutouts and assumed I would receive certain ones that I did not end up receiving.This wouldn't be a huge issue for me if it weren't for the fact that of the 11 types that are actually shipped, I already have 5. Kind of disappointing...I was really hoping to switch things up a bit more. Oh well."
4,"Reprint of Principles of NLP, 1996","I was misled by the new title and publishing date and enthusiastically ordered multiple copies. But it was disappointing to discover that it is only a reprint. Please cf. my review of Principles of NLP two years ago. It is still a very good and lucid introduction to NLP, a complement to the author's Introduction to NLP, which did not include the Presuppositions.(The book has 190 pages, not 224.)"
1,New item not at all represented!,"we ordered a New bible as a gift for a man who had never had one. When we received it, it looked like new but had a womans name ENGRAVED on the cover. There was no time to replace it before Christmas so we ended up buying him something else to go along with the bible. When we emailed the seller, they appologized and refunded $5 of the purchase price. What should have been a special gift was an embarrasing gift! I am not as likely to check amazon when shopping for items in the future. I will definately make sure I am not buying from an outside seller."
1,A lesson in the excessive use of modifiers,"This book reminded me of student essays where the lesson was ""adding color with adjectives."" The reading level is easy, but the tedium of the author's style made it impossible for me to get past the third chapter. It's as if he wrote his story and then was required to add at least 2 adjectives or adverbs to each sentence. My opinion of this book is so different from the previous customer reviews that I wonder if they are friends of the author. This book goes to the next book drive."
3,It's....ok I guess.,"This is a really cute teapot but I have a couple of problems with it. The holes in the infuser are too big so my tea is inundated with loose tea leaves. It would be so much better if it were wire like some of the other ones I've seen and used. To solve this problem I have to cut a coffee filter in half and stuff in down in the infuser. Also, the infuser does'nt seem to be deep enough to cover the tea leaves completly with water. I have lots of friends who drink tea but I probably won't be purchasing this as a gift for anyone soon."
3,Possibly a great resource...,"...but not for me. I own the Eclectic McGuffey Readers, and thought this would work for me. I liked the suggestions that were offered, but I couldn't relate them to our books, because they didn't correlate correctly. I believe the suggestions would only work with the Original Readers, because they in no way matched up with the lessons I have in the Eclectic Readers. If you have the Original Readers, you may be very happy with these--just be certain you do have the correct books!"
4,Teaching Reading,"This parent/teacher guide is useful if you look at the McGuffey reader series and have no clue what to do with the books to get started teaching your child/pupils how to read. However if you look at the McGuffey series and it makes sense to you how to get started, then you can skip this one."
5,Like a slug of whiskey for your funny bone,"Along with books on how to write, any aspiring writer should have books on how NOT to write, and this one certainly fits the bill. It is crammed with examples of the worst in crime fiction, so it is not only a good instruction manual for helping you avoid the pitfalls of bad writing but provides a boost of morale to those who think their writing isn't up to snuff. Should be on your bookshelf next to The Stuffed Owl and Damon Knight's In Search of Wonder."
5,HILARIOUS,"A wonderful collection of snippets from spectacularly bad pulp writing. I remember loving some of the authors mentioned (Richard Prather in particular, but he knew he was spoofing). A real delight for fans of those old school mass-market paperbacks."
3,Pretty,"I was a bit disappointed with this one...Out of all of things I bought from amazon...I think this has been the only one that disappointed me in terms of sizing...the bra did not fit me right; it feels too small in some places...plus the garter belt looks a bit weird. This was my favorite when I ordered and I was so sad that it looked nothing like what I expected. I am determined to lose some weight and hopefully get a better fit out of the garter belt...it feels kind of small, too. The quality of the fabric is not the best, either..."
2,HUNK O JUNK,"Not a good shape at all, wish I would have bought one more like the thigh master. Awkward to use and I am just waiting for it to bust and hit me in the face. Don't even waste your money!"
4,Worth the money,This is a great product. The tension isn't super high so if you're a fitness buff you may want to get something more hard core. But it is perfect for everyday people who are wanting to tone up their thighs. It's in great condition and you could use it practically anywhere. The only thing is you have to hold it in place sometimes so it doesn't slide off your legs.
4,Great Seller,This product arrived very quickly.I keep it under my desk at work to work out my thighs during the course of the day. I also take it with me on road trips. It is very small and easy to travel with.
2,thigh excerciser,"I DON'T LIKE THIS PRODUCT, WHY? BECAUSE IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE TO USE, IT LOOK AND FEEL CHEAP, AND I HAVE YET TO FEEL AS IF I'VE HAD ANY REAL KIND OF WORK OUT. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE REAL THING, OR BETTER YET JUST DO SQUATS OR GO TO THE GYM. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
2,Reproduction,"It's definitely not the original Thigh Master. It's a cheaper version. It's not as large, thus making it less of a stretch to exercise with. I wouldn't get another one."
3,"Surreal, tight and sometimes cryptic","About a third of the 60 stories are absolute gems, I have enjoyed so much that I read them twice just for the fun of it. Black humor at its best, cynical and surprising.Another third I found difficult to read, too surreal even for one who likes the genre.The last third...well, it's hard to decide: the prose is so tight, so concise... that it becomes almost cryptic.Overall an interesting collection of an outstanding writer."
5,This book is an incredible collection of short stories,"This collection of short stories contains some of the most original and funny work ever published. This father of post modernism, Barthelme, has a mind like no other. His creativity is endless. From the sybolism that adorns ""The Indian Uprising"" to the whit of ""Me and Miss Mandible"", the book is truly incredible."
3,Hyperbolically intransigent ancient wisdom.,"Donald Barthelme picked up on the love of words for words' sake. Words never in isolation, but rather, immeshed in complex and new ways of knowing."
2,Not what is pictured.,"When I first saw this I thought manThis is a good deal for a rain suit. To my dismay when I opened the box it was only the bib and not the jacket. The material is durable and lasted longer than most gear I have used, but understand you are only getting the bib and not the jacket as pictured."
1,Disappointed,"Wanted to know where to find the oil sending sensor, a simple fix, and this book makes no mention of it, anywhere."
4,Seems reasonable.,"I picked Chiltons up with the Haynes Manual. Unless you get a shop manual, no one manual covers everything. They sometimes offer slightly different ways of doing things. Chilton seems fine."
3,for children,I bought this for my granddaughter in Tennessee....she loved it and it helps her understand storms so much better and makes her less afraid.
4,FROM MEEE!,"well, i seen half of this video cuz i waz at my couzinz it was awesome what i saw, maybe cuz i imagined me lookin straight at it"
3,"""Distant Replay"" is for the hard-core Jerry Kramer fan only","I had been something of a Jerry Kramer fan as a child and I must say that I looked forward to this book with considerable anticipation. After all, I'd really liked ""Instant Replay"" and was curious to see what had happened to my heroes since they moved on from football. If Kramer had stuck to a review of ""where are they now"" it would have been a much better read. Unfortunately, he seems quite self-absorbed...This was a disillusioning read for me; it made me look at Kramer's previous works in a much harsher light. [Maybe that's not so bad!]"
1,Shrunk in 3 washes,"I bought this and several other shirts for my husband to wear on casual Fridays. My husband is broad-chested and has a long torso, so a shirt's ability to maintain its shape is a must. Unfortunately, this shirt shrunk so much after the third wash that it became unwearable in all environments except around the house.Recommendation: Don't bother."
5,Hugh Holton's Criminal Element,This is one of the best written books ever! Wow! It's a real page-turner. I couldn't stop reading until I finished it. Mr. Holton created awesome characters and numerous twists and turns. This book should be made into a movie!
1,bad salt,"this salt has an obvious odor of some chemicel. beware! Unless you plan on using in a bath, i would stay away from it."
3,Great,"I bought it hearing my friend's suggestion. Preciously I was fed up after using `Taste Specialty Foods, French Sea Salt' because it has some serious chemical odor though it was marketed as non chemical used salt. So, I choose this `Sayulita Sea Salt'Sayulita Sea Salt - Organic Coarse - 16 oz - by RealGoodSaltwhich adds extra dimension in my food."
1,Tatses like cough medicine,"Unlike the Trident Cool Colada, the mint and fruit does not mix too well here. Tastes kinda like Robitussin or Formula 44."
5,More than just how to sell--it's how to shape your life,"Most people in sales go from one deal to the next, always wondering if the well is going to run dry. This is a long, hard way to make a living. It's so much better to become a person of such high integrity and trust that customers come to rely on you--not so much your product or service, but you personally. This does not happen overnight. But readers of High Trust Selling will get a head-start on changing their lives from salesmen to those who seek to serve and help. Highly recommended to all who sell anything."
5,Purchased for grandchildren,"Since we are so far apart, it's nice to give the grandkids something that might corrupt them just a little since I can't alway play the pull my finger game why not send a books about a farting dog?"
3,Cheaply published,"I have been collecting the entire series since the first ""Walter"" book was published. This one was a disappointment in the way in which it was bound. The first 3 books were hardcover. This one is a flimsy softcover which will not stand up. Poor choice by the publisher...."
3,Watch what buttons you click!,"This book was a total accidental purchase. Searching for childrens books on dogs for my great grandson and somehow I must have selected this book. It certainly isn't appropriate for an 18 mo. old and, although a friend of mine laughed like crazy at it, I plan on taking it to the used book store so someone can browse through it before buying. My low star rating is entirely my own fault for not being more careful during the purchasing phase."
1,One Star for Intriguing Art,"I like the imaginative artwork. That said, why does everything under the sun have to be discussed/applauded? I agree with the previous review in that the world was a better place when there were concepts such as discretion, privacy, decorum, taste other than poor, etc. The world has LOST something. I'm no prude, and I enjoy an off color joke once in awhile, but this is too much."
1,BS,Just the title of this book gives away the apathy in America today. What could children possibly learn from such toilet fodder? Why are poor and despicable manners acceptable in light of so many books being banned because of their lack of political correctness? Because someone's feelings got hurt?! Get over it! This is BS! This deserves negative stars but Amazon doesn't give us that option.
1,Is this a Scratch and Sniff Book?,What a crass topic - I didn't think it was possbile to write and publish such a stupid book. How many IQ points do you lose if read the book? Read the others in the series? Actually waste your money on something like this?
3,Another Walter Lesson,"Our daughter is not always thrilled for the young ones to recieve yet another Walter book, especially as our grandson, now 8, delights in the 'f(art)' word... But there is always a lesson in the Walter books and this one is no exception. We have an adult friend who keeps the books in her bathroom...... so Walter is enjoyed by young and not so....."
5,beautiful gift for my mom,"When I got married I purchased necklaces for everybody in the wedding party. The fiery opal and diamond was for my mom. She collects opals. For the price this was a steal. She loved it, and thought I had spent alot."
3,never a city so real;a walk in chicago,"The author has captured what is, to me, a very accurate description of the people, modern history and neighborhoods of Chicago.The edition I bought was rated as ""LIKE NEW"" and so it appeared until I flipped through and found sveral pagesunderlined and/or highlighted. Who does this? Dirt heads, that's who does this."
1,Horrible,"This waste of ink, paper, and time isn't even useful as a doorstop. This book is not about Chicago, it is about the author's politics (which is communism disguised as liberalism.)Early in the book, the author claims that the owners of Chicago steel companies got complacent and forgot how to compete. The fact of the matter is that meeting the demands of the unions priced the steel much higher than the units arriving from East Europe and Asia. This is the first of so many instances that the author proves he is uninformed. He is also inaccurate in geography, history, and one funny instance of a math goof.Don't waste your time."
1,Not what I expected to see,"very much looked forward to getting dvd of Milton. Was very disappointed in the quality and the camera work on him. I would have liked to know before I bought it that it was not shot professionally. Maybe after this dvd, they will learn to just promote the show, and leave the other to a professional."
2,Little Milton - the Last cnocert,"I'am a huge fan of little milton's music, (I was disappointed with this dvd.layout and content). He was such a great blue singer, It only seems reasonable to believe, there has to be a complete live concert which was video'ed and stored by the various producer's/manager's of his music/career, only waiting to be assembled professionally and offered to the million's of his fan's to purchase for their enjoyment.Little Milton - The Last Concert (Collectors Edition)"
2,Boring last concert,"This concertwas not very good at all. It was a slow, boring and not the best concert for Little Milton"
1,Cross gone Chinese,"I was really disappointed by the quality of this pens' refills, as everything that transfered from USA to China lost it quality.The ink when you write spreads in a terrible way, and looks like you are writting with a 2 cent pen."
5,One of My Fav Albums of All Time,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this album. I somehow stumbled across 8mm online or perhaps heard a song on satellite radio. I had purchased the CD years ago and have listened to it so many times since. My CD was broken so I had to download another copy, it's an album I cannot live without it is that good. I burned a copy for my sister who loves it, too. She said I always find the best little known bands and 8mm is definitely one of those! The sound is sexy and relaxing with bits of drama thrown in to keep it interesting."
3,"Good storyline & characters, but needed pruning","The Chivalrous Rake has a lot of strengths. The supporting cast of characters is well drawn and contribute depth to the story. The sexual tension, misunderstandings between the protagonists, and his unforgiveable behavior (in several instances) became tedious. This good story could have been excellent if repetitive angst had been edited out. I recently read Ms. Rolls's Lord Braybrook's Penniless Bride and thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,A fun read but at times repetitive,"I did enjoy this read. I was really looking forward to Jack's book and he has been such a likeable character. Some of his actions in this book seemed a bit out of character to him. The fondness between Cressida and her father was very sweet. At times Jack was perfect and what we all would love in a man and then at times he was just so off his mark that it didn't make alot of sense. The ending was VERY good but it could have used a nice epilogue to finish it off. I especially liked that Cressida took care of the villain, instead of the man always getting all the fun."
3,A little tedious at times,"I have become a great fan of Elizabeth Rolls recently but found this book not quite as good as others I have read. In the book ""The unruly chaperon"", Rolls makes good use of the plot devise..'the misunderstanding'. She tries to do the same again here but I found it didn't work quite as well, and I found it got quite tedious at times. This is an enjoyable story but not one to go on my keeper shelf."
1,Coby DVD,"This product was defective from the moment I opened the box. The remote did not work at all and it could not be fast forwarded or anything else from the DVD player. The actual DVD player froze the movies I put in, so I sent this product back for a refund and went to K-Mart and purchased a better DVD player."
2,Just OK...that's all,"I purchased these for a 2006 Hyundai Sonata. According to the application guide, this is the model number that fits the 06 Sonata. They fit fine, but the operation is mediocre at best. They lift better that the old ones that had worn out over time, but these tend to bind on the way up. This binding causes the trunk to ""stick"" on the way up. I'm afraid to push up on the trunk because it could break the lift. I should have returned them immediately, but I didn't so forget it now. Lesson learned!Additionally, I purchased a set of these for a 2004 Cadillac CTS (not this model--see different reveiw), and they work a bit better than these. However, the lift support does not work nearly as good since the weather has gotten cooler. I'm in Vegas, so maybe its been around low 50s (not really cold), but that temperature has definitly impacted the lifting properties.I won't buy this brand again. Instead, I'll pay probably double at the dealer, and get a better product...hopefully!"
4,Good Quality,"I just received the watch today, it's a solid watch with a nice gold shine as it is not too bright nor dull. The band has a good feel to it and stays firm on your wrist. My wrist are about medium and I'm wearing the band on the last hole that is closest to the face. This is my first automatic watch and is still too early to judge the accuracy of the piece, so I'll try to remember and keep up to date with further reviews.Update March 8th: For the past month the watch has been performing well as I wear it every other day so I need to self-wind it from time to time to keep it running. It is a bit fast (30 secs to a minute) after two days, but as I said I don't wear it everyday so that might be a factor to its jump. Simple design so the complements are moderate, I don't want it to be too flashy so its perfect. The leather strap is comfortable and well-fitting. Rating is still a solid 4 stars, I have yet to review an item that deserves a 5 stars as it would be 100% perfect."
1,Disappointment,"Although I was very enthousiastic when I received this watch, I am disappointed. The watch wasn't running accurately, it runs too fast. Then I was told this that this is normal, but I should wind the watch regularly to run more precidely.It's being sold as automatic watch, and now I have to manually wind every 2/3 days. Unfortunately a disappointment."

4,This one's for the girls!,"I'm not a big fan of fraternities or sororities. (If only they really were what they proclaim themselves to be...) The title of this DVD exposes all that could go wrong when people (in any type of organization) are overcome by negativity.Of course, there are many wonderful organizations out there. Dying to Belong dramatizes only the worst that can happen with the help of some now famous faces. If you enjoy an occasional cautionary tale about girls gone wrong, you'll love this film."
3,Okay Viewing,"This movie deals with college peer pressure and sororities.This features Hillary Swank before her mega stardom days, pre- ""Boy's Don't Cry""& ""Million Dollar Baby"", it is very evident early on, as with this picture, thatHillary had major talent and was going to be a star. It also stars the sidekick to the star of the 90's tv show ""Blossom,"" Jenna Van Oy, who also gave anoutstanding performance, nothing like her flaky character on Blossom.I would recommend this to young girls, early teens, and especially parents'whose daughters are going to be going away for college, it is a must see,a real eye opener on how far some people will go just to be liked and to fitin, literally in one girls' case dying to fit in."
3,Its all good,"I thought that this was going to be better that it really was. It was good, dont get me wrong, but it just wasnt what I was expecting. It does, however, show just how bad things can get during that hazing and all that for Fraternities and Sororities"
4,You'll either like it or hate it,"Not great, but entertaining enough--geared toward teenage girls. I think what really makes it interesting are the familiar faces of Sarah Chalke, Hilary Swank, and Mark-Paul Gossalear, whose acting is decent in an otherwise weak movie. Plenty of people would hate this movie, but it was worth the money to me. It's something to watch."
2,Definite Hollywood Shoot-em-up,"The only way to catch a gopher is to think like a gopher. Or in this case, to create his exact twin. The book might as well be a the script to the movie because it reads just that way. Half the story is centered on the recruitment of Ramirez, Carlos' double, and the other half on what the CIA does to trap the Jackal. I have read better and worse. This falls into that area of purely no-brainer reading. If you don't want to think much for an afternoon, this is your book."
4,No problems,"For those of us who still iron, this is an excellent pad and cover. I hope it can be washed--I need to check into that."
2,Scorch marks,"After spraying a light mist of water on a wrinkle, this cover burned. My shirt did not get burned, but there's a large brown scorch mark on the cover now."
5,Corning dishes,Bought these to use in our travel trailer--they are light and sturdy and nice to look at and travel well.
3,Not Marked Fragile,"To make a long story short, my problem is not with the product so much as it is with the method of shipment. The product is fine, although the plates look uneven when stacked. I had two separate shipments sent due to an abundance of shattered dishes. Neither the original shipment, nor the replacement shipment was marked 'fragile.' I ended up getting a partial refund and bought the dishes elswhere."
4,Food For Cooks: Essential Ingredients for Every Cook's Pantry,Fabulous first cook book for all new kitchen dwellers
3,A Grassy and Boring Picnic,"I didn't see any instances in this film where I would consider it an ""epic"" as was tagged onto the film as it also won numerous awards. The film is rather tame and boring and doesn't break any new ground, at times its often tedious. The story concerns a gaucho (a cowboy living in Argentina) and his existential journey through suffering. The camera angles are amateurish and at times, it seems like we are just watching a bunch of extras on the screen. Most of them have the worst hair pieces and beards used in cinema. The fight between the calvary troops and the ""injuns"" is staged and not very credible. Although for the most part this film lacks any traits which would make it seem like a highly enjoyable film, there are some existential leanings that give one a sense of time and alienation."
4,"Good, cranky fun","This is one of Constantine's delightful Mario Balzic crime novels, featuring the cranky, profanity-spewing Rocksburg, Pennsylvania police chief. First published in 1983, this one is a delight, as are all of the Mario Balzic novels; little gems that need to be rediscovered. In this tale, Mario must deal with a clueless new police chief, a notorious pimp, and a double-talking black preacher. Amidst the laughs and profanity, you will find some genuine tension and heartbreak, and of course murders and burglary. Gotta have lots of crime to fuel these stories. Mystery fans should enjoy this one, and the rest of Constantine's Mario Balzic novels."
5,ITS GOOD AS *ELL,"I RECOMEND YOU BUY THIS ONE.IT HAS SOME OF THE GREATEST CORRIDOS I'VE EVER HEARD.THEY GOT OFF ON THIS ALBUM,BUT ITS NOT THE FIRST TIME THEY DID THAT.YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT DOES IT FOR ME IS THAT SOUND OF THE BANDA THAT GETS ME UP AND DANCE MY HEART OUT!VIVA MEXICO! SIGAN TRAFICANDO A U.S.A.!"
5,awesome song,this song is a true classic from Nat. The words are inspiring. Anyone with any emotion at all would appriciate it.
3,George of the Jungle taken seriously,"I kept expecting to see him hit a tree but it doesn't happen. Overall, the story isn't bad but a bit slow at times."
3,Steve Dawson - 'Pandemonium Circus' (Angel Air),"Steve Dawson was a founder and early bassist for Saxon.'Pandemonium Circus' is apparently a solo project that he had dabbled with for three years.Overall,a decent 'heavy rock' effort,as it features some demos as well as a couple of live tracks.Tunes that I was semi-impressed with were ""All I Want"",his Beatles cover ""Step Inside Love"",the Saxon-ish ""We're Giving It Up"",""2 Late"",the well written ""More Follin'"" and an actual Saxon song,a live version of ""Motorcycle Man"".Line-up:Steve Dawson-bass,Steve Johnson-guitar&vocals,Adrian Davidson-vocals,Hayda Conway-guitar and former fellow Saxon mate Nigel Durham-drums.Comes with a 12-page booklet with informative liner notes and photos.Check it out."
4,Pretty dishes and good value,I ordered three sets of these dishes and when they came the handle of one cup was broken. When I called Amazon I was told that they were out of stock. Since I really don't use 12 cups very often I asked if they could do something financially rather than sending evrything back. They gave me a 20% discount on the one set which I feel is fair. The dishes are light weight and stack much easier than my stoneware. This is actually the fourth set of Corelle I have had in the past 35 years!
4,Jannel,I really like the correlle ware that I bought. I did buy it for a Residential Care Facility so I am using them in a commercial setting. I wanted to put color into the residents dining experience. We are having trouble with the mug handles but it may be due to the how the cups are being put into the dishwasher racks and hitting them together. I may have to find a mug that will stand up better in this situation. The dishes are beautiful and the residents really like the design. It gives a more home like environment. The dietary staff like them because they are a lot lighter than commercial dinner ware when lifting the racks. We are very happy with this product as whole.
4,Good introduction to the War of 1812,"This book is a good, even-handed introduction to the War of 1812. The causes of the war, the major campaigns and battles, some of the major personalities, and the concluding Treaty of Ghent are all covered in varying levels of detail. American readers, who learned in school (as I did) that the War of 1812 was a ""second war of independence"", will find that not everyone shares this point of view.In some sections it would have been nice to have a little more detail, but the author did a good job to cover so much within the limitations of the Essential History series. The book is a good overview and provides many references for further reading. I recommend it."
2,IT WAS A BIT CONFUSING AND FAST PACED.,"I have many of Catherine Coulter's books and have enjoyed most of them. I have to admit that this book was a disappointment. I felt that the book had too many things going on. I must say that Gray was a delightful character, but he just wasn't enough to keep me interested in this elongated story. I finished it only because I feel that once I start something I have to finish it. Read it and see what you think. But I can honestly say that I do not recommend it."
2,disappointing,"What had the making of an enjoyable story line with fun and zany characters got lost in the love scenes. A difficult read. I like a love scene as well as the next gal, but I felt I never got out of the bedroom. Sorry, Coulter was not at her best this time."
1,Asinine with Vapid Characters.,"If this were a satirical view of Regency books, I might have bought the far-fetched storyline, the flat, idiotic characters, and the absolute silliness of the rather dull plot. As I rather suspect it is not a satire - Catherine Coulter being a best-selling Romance novelist - it was disappointing to say the very least. I only, I repeat, only listened to it in its entirety because I hadn't brought anything else to listen to at work one day. If you like historical romance that's fun and funny, try Katie MacAlister's book ""Improper English"", or for some more serious historical fiction, check out Phillippa Gregory's Wideacre series."
1,Ms. Coulter is slipping in quality,"Her novels used to be fun and passionate, if with perhaps a bittoo much violence toward women. Used repeatedly it seems like aneasy-to-invoke plot device.The first clue to quality slips in the Regency/historical offerings were the re-issues of shorter novels as expanded ones. The new Regencies since then are beginning to all sound alike.Every heroine's ""eyes cross with lust"". Etc.By the time I got to Mad Jack, I was totally confused mid-way through. Simply because the author kept throwing in new elements to separate her main couple. Eventually the two of them seemed like different people in each chapter. I could not imagine how Jack got from an ignorant bride (of things ""bridal"") to the wisdom-dispensing mature counsellor of her husband over the trauma induced by his mother. When did Jack make THAT transition? The story takes place over a fairly brief period of time.Slow down, Ms. Coulter. It seems like she's hurrying to the bank to deposit royalties."
2,Too much chatting with characters from previous books!,"I hate to be a nay-sayer, because I usually like Catherine Coulter's books, but I was very disappointed! There was much too much chatting with characters from previous Coulter books. If you haven't read those books, you may feel lost. I have read those books and I merely felt impatient. Where is the story for this book? The answer is that it is very thin and very contrived. Many other Coulter titles (including The Wild Baron and The Wyndam Legacy) are very good with a lot more character development and the same light tone. Read one of those! Your time and money will be better spent."
1,You are losing your readers!,"For the first time in 10 years, I threw a Coulter book out half way through it. I got the feeling the publisher was harassing Catherine Coulter for a book and this is the trash she produced. What a waste of money, but worse yet, since this is the second time I bought a Coulter book I didn't like (the first was a re-release supposedly re-written) I no longer buy a newly released Coulter romance. If it really looks interesting I will get it from the library.Don't let this stop you from reading her ""modern"" books. Obviously, Coulter is bored with romances and has changed her focus! The mysteries are great!"
2,"A weak effort, at best.","This book gives one the sense that the author was rushed when writing it. The plot is silly and totally lacking in originality. She drops all these other characters into the mix which are apparently just filler, and serve no purpose.Consider another work by this author, she is really talented in this genre. Unfortunately that is not evident in this book."
2,Boring,"Is is my imagination or has Catherine Coulter started using the same hero and heroine in, oh say, the last 5 or 6 books? This was the most boring by far. I have other Catherine Coulter books that I love and re-read over and over. This is not one of them. Ever since The Wyndham Legacy (which is one of my favorites) the characters have begun to seem like they are all the same person. Even the minor characters. They are no longer entertaining and humerous. Now they are stilted and repetitious. Of course, the last couple of her novels that I've purchased were re-written older novels that were good the first time around. Maybe she should start off with a fresh book and see what comes of it."
2,Leave the Sherbrookes alone already!,"If you were to read this without having read The Sherbrooke Bride, you would think Alex Sherbrooke is one of the stupidest, obnoxious women around, and she isn't!Jack and Gray aren't anything special, and the plot itself never grabbed me. The worst part was that I was looking forward to reading about the Sherbrookes, and it seems they've been losing their IQ steadily since I last met them."
1,Tired and worn out,"I wasn't sure if I was reading a new novel, or just re-reading one of several of the last Catherine Coulter novels I've waded through. I think that I am truly sick of the big, strong man caring for sick, injured woman bit. The story was dumb; there was no real mystery. I love the ""Song"" series and most of the Sherbrooke Brides series. This was plain disappointing."
1,This is the worst book ever!!!!!!!!!,This rating dont even deserve 1 star this book sucks!!!!!!!!! Do not waste your money on this crap!
2,"Stilted Dialog, Contrived Plot","I wasn't able to finish the book because I couldn't get through the stilted dialog which made it difficult to get interested in the story line. SPOILER: The whole Mad Jack disguise is broken within the first 50 pages, what's the point in continuing to refer to her as Jack? Or Mad?"
1,Auido (MP3) version was downright painful...,"The storyline was weak with very forgettable characters. The heroine was a complaining inept airhead and her ""Devirgination""should not take so long and then we have to listen to her complain about it for hours afterward. And Georgie? who came across as a freakish stuttering child was reenactted by the narrator in an annoying stuttering whine. One character was actually described has having a magnificent bosom what is that? I can't help but picture this poor ""regency"" woman toppling over to reach for her tea.."
1,Terrible---,I am a big fan of Catherine Coulter's--but this book was a big disappointment----I will check out her next novels more closely before I spend the money on them again--
2,BAD BOOK?,"Ms. Coulter has been one of my favorite authors for many years. So naturally buying Mad Jack (from the locate book store and not Amazon. Com) and paying full price was not an issue, until I finished the book, then I felt that it was the principal (paying that kind of money I'm going to finsh the book). I was truly disappointed with Ms. Coulter's writing. I almost could not get rid of the headaches from trying to keep up with the verbiage between the characters. I was truly disappointed that is wasn't what I am use to from Ms. Coulter, I will definitely think twice about buying another Catherine Coulter book, and full price....not!"
4,Another good book on those cold nites.,She has done it again. Another wonderful book with strong a female beating the odds
1,It was terrible,"I have ready many of Ms. Coulter novels and this was, by far, the worst. The sentences were short, stilted, and repetitive. Where was the plot, the story line? This book seemed like it was written with no effort or thought. She kept repeating the same thing to take up space. This one is going in the recycle bin! I know she can write better than this."
3,"Not bad, but not one of her best.","I am an avid reader of romance and LOVE Catherine Coulter and Johanna Lindsey. This book, Mad Jack, was not one of her best. The story line falls flat and there didn't seem to be much passion between Jack and Grey.In the beginning, he nurses her back to health and she is naked infront of him for four days and he feels very little attraction to her. I also found confusing the many scenes with a lot of the characters from her other ""Bride"" books. The sex, however, is as steamy as always. She gets an A+ for that! The mystery that is mentioned lasts about two chapters and then is resolved so that didn't add too much to the book but who reads romance for the mystery?All in all, not a bad effort and it's a quick read."
2,The worst Catherine Coulter has ever written,"Catherine Coulter is usually an amazing writer. But I think she rushed this one, not the plot line itself but I'm sure she was working under a deadline and it just wasn't working. She needs to slow down and stop trying to put out so many books."
2,Disappointing but not a total Disaster!!,I have read quite a lot of Coulter's books but Mad jack was not up to her usual high standards. The storyline was a bit erratic but the appearances of characters from the Heiress Books made it a lot more fun plus the aunt's sounded to me as if they had lived a very interesting life. Try to do better next time Catherine...okay?!
2,"Rambling, secondary characters didn't have a purpose",I was disappointed in Mad Jack. It seemed disjointed with no real reason for the secondary characters to be in the book. Not up to Catherine Coulter's usual standards.
1,Not Good,This book was a waste of time. I like Catherine Coulter's books but this is not worth the time it took to read it. I think this was a fast write book. It was dissorganized like school papers done at 2:00 am the day they are due. I am very dissatified with this. I hope her next book is better.
2,"Beautiful Print & Design, Horrible Typos!","The book is full of wonderful information that any graphics student/enthusiast should know, but EVERY page it seems has HUGE typos. Some words are even the complete wrong word ""dot"" instead of ""does"" or ""pwdr"" instead of ""powder"". This book isn't that expensive, but when I'm learning something or referring to a book for information (instead of the unreliable internet) I want to be confident in the information I am gathering. Due to the many typos I am not always sure their information is right. On a happier note, the print quality is awesome and the design work is something I would expect a graphics book to look like. So, 4 1/2 stars on the graphics side, 1 star on the grammatical portion and 3 on the info only because I am not always so confident in the information."
