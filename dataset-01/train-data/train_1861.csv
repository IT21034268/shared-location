3,The Cheapo Version of Jenga,Wood blocks for the Milton Bradley jenga are not finely finished like I have seen from other manufacturers. Jenga blocks traditionally come in a wooden box that acts as a holder for assembling the blocks. Milton Bradley's loading platform is made of thin cardboard. This low quality detracts from normally fine experience of playing jenga.
3,JENGA,Jenga is a lot of fun to play. You must remove the wooden pieces while trying not to knock the tower over. This game has a very simple concept but is still a lot of fun
5,clean up is tedious but game is worth it,"This game is fun, especially when you are a little tipsy. The blocks go everywhere and it is a pain to clean up but it is really fun."
5,Beautiful watch!,"This is a beautiful, feminine watch. One warning! It is extremely hard to put on if you have arthritis! Makes a wonderful gift."
3,Only one pirate left,"I have ""Skull Wars"", and a few others. This cd lacks power, and kind of sounds incomplete. Mick Green is the only pirate left to the band. Some of the older songs are slowed down, and are no longer enjoyable. Singing and music is ok, but sounds like a half-hearted effort. I'll keep playing the ""Skull Wars"" album instead of this ."
5,The classic cheezy icebreaker game.,"College freshmen - sometime during orientation you will be forced to play this game! Sure, it's silly, and you definitely have to be in the mood to make an idiot out of yourself, but hey - It's fun. It helps if you and your team mates share a psychic bond so you can sense what that squiggle with a blob on top is supposed to mean. For a real challenge, use the pictionary cards to play charades (ever tried to act out paisley?)"
1,Blechy Blech,"Before I begin to rant-get one thing straight. I LOVE BOARD GAMES!!! So you can imagine how bad this is, if someone like me, who owns at least 200 board games, despises it. This game is just plain stupid. Also, since I tend to get nervous when I'm on timer, hated the little hourglass, pouring sand into the bottom chamber. Please, don't throw away your hard-earned money, get yourself a fun and more worthwile game, like Trivial Pursuit, or Clue."
5,Great family fun,"My family has played this game for many years. It's been enjoyed by all the kids and adults...let's see; there are 28 of us all together. And extended family has been adding it, too, to their lists of faves. (Other family faves include Taboo, Imposter, and Scattergories.)"
4,Pictionary or Art Class?,"Pictionary is a fun, fairly fast paced game. Anyone that can somewhat draw can play. So, if your three year old knows how to draw pretty well, count him in. The object of the game is to try to have the other people playing the game guess the word from the object you are drawing. First of all you have to draw a card. On that card it says what to draw. For example, you might have to draw a potato or a dog or a police man. You try to fill up the five spaces and have everyone guess what it is before the hour-glass timer runs up. It's a fun game and anyone can play. It also teaches children how to draw and put names of objects with their name; like drawing a triangle, then they say a triangle. So it both entertaining and educational at the same time."
4,Pretty retro fan,"I own an original Vornado fan made in the 1940's that looks identical to this new one. The only visible difference is the addition of a rear finger guard. Very authentic retro style, and probably one of the finer looking fans from this era.The reason I rated it at 4 stars is this new model has a plastic blade, but is all steel otherwise. Side by side my 40's model will outperform it. With a metal blade this fan would be any easy 5 stars."
3,Cool Look...Loud Sound,This fan is really cool looking. I love the green color. I agree with the other reviewers regarding the plastic at the base. Furthermore the fan blades are plastic as well. I feel it does not push enough air (ie it should have a higher setting). I also wish the cord was attached to the base instead of the fan itself as it is less attractive. It should also have a handle to help in carrying it. The high setting to me is too loud. I have fans that push more air (allaire bought from Restoration Hardware) that are much quieter and cost the same.I would love to see them recreate the floor model of this fan. which should be easy as it is the same fan with a stand. This would be expensive but I surely would buy it!
3,"Look Great, Sounds Terrible",Love the looks and air movement - but it is not quiet. Within 2-3 weeks started with a low rumble that sounds like bearings going bad. Worst when the fan is horizontal - which is ho you'd like it most of the time.
4,Epidemiologic Methods,This book covers epidemiology beyond the basics. It is at a graduate course level in epidemiology. The book is easy to read for the most part. A general knowledge of biostatistics is helpful. The numerous examples make the concepts easier to understand. There are excercises at the end of every chapter to illustrate the topics further. I recommend the book to anyone who is in interested in an in depth look at epidemiologic methods.
5,Emmy Award winning movie !!!,Great documentary. Won an emmy for historical documentary and would agree that it is emmy worthy!!Must see for all civil war buffs!
4,True Belivers! You will love this...,"Marvel Ultimate Alliance is a great game for the pure fun of engaging in the imagination space of being Captain America, Thor, or any of the other 20+ characters included with your version of the game. Being a long time comic book reader since the 70's it was quite a trip to engage in all the various corners of the Marvel Universe including the home of the Inhumans, The Skrulls. and so many other aspects of the mind of Stan ""the man"" Lee. I also enjoyed the flexability of crossing between the various incarnations of the classic, ultimate and other graphic versions of the characters. Being able to play on the Thor's persona's ""Beta Ray Bill"" was wonderuful. I reccomend this for anyone who is a true believer! Excelsior! Thanks to activison and Stan Lee for this wonderful world!"
5,Best Gift,Husband loves games and this is his new favorite--he loves to change characters and you can have up to 4 players
3,Need to grow into,We have a 6 yo girl and she will definitely need to grow into this game. A little too difficult at the present time.
4,A good clean game,This is a great game for young teens. There is a lot of fighting but it doesn't have the gore or foul language of other games like gears of war.
3,Too confusing,"Wish it was not too confusing, would have returned it if I didn't already open it and play it."
3,SHE TRIED TO HARD,"THIS ALBUM IS JUST NOT THAT GOOD HER 2002 THALIA CD IS WAY BETTER1.I WANT U 7/10 ITS OK BUT SOUNDS ALOT LIKE JLO STYLE2.BABY IM IN LOVE/ 9/10 I ACTUALLY LIKE THIS ONE3.MISBEHAVIN 10/10 BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM REALLY GREAT4.DONT LOOK BACK 8/10 KINDA SUCKS BUT IT GOT GOOD PLAY AT CLUBS5.ANOTHER GIRL 7/10 ITS OK BUT IT GETS OLD6.WHATS IT GONNA BE BOY? 8/10 ITS ALRIGHT BUT NOT GREAT7.CLOSER TO YOU 6/10 WASENT THIS SONG ON THE 2002 ALBUM8.SAVE THE DAY 0/10 I,VE ONLY LISTENED TO IT LIKE 2 BECAUSE SUCKS9.TU Y YO(ENGLSH) 8/10 STICK TO THE SPANISH VERSION PLEASE10. DANCE DANCE 9/10 SHOULD OF BEEN A BONUS TRACK AND REPLACED WITH THE ORIGINAL. THIS SONG WAS ALSO HOT AT ALL THE CLUBS11.ME PONES SEXY 0/10 SOUNDS WACK IN SPANISH12.ALGUIEN REAL 10/10 BEST SPANISH TRACK ON THIS ALBUM** THERES TWO MORE SONGS BUT I NEVER LISTEN TO THEM ** LOL"
3,Not Her Best....,"I grew up listening to Thalia...she has a beautiful voice...however this album does not really display that. I think they were trying to create that R&B/Pop sound that is ""in"" right now...but in doing that they fell short in originality....they definately down played her vocals just to get a certain over-all ""sound""....the album is good, but I know Thalia is capable of much more....don't let this album fool you...the girl is TALENTED!!!!!"
3,Here's Thalia!,"Thalia is one of many artists that has decided to make a career in English after beeing a popular singer in Latin America for a long time, i haven't followed her back then but i think this album is a good attempt afterall. Eventhough rapper Fat Joe appears on the hit single ""I want you"" this is a typical pop album, most songs are easygoing with good melodies anf hook, half of the songs are also in Spanish. I like ""Another girl"" starts slow but with a strong hook which suits her voice well. ""Save the day"" and ""Baby im in love"" are also strong pop tracks. ""Don't look back"" reminds me of Kylie Minogue, with some more dance beats it would be cool. It's a nice album, nothing that will go down in history but a good pop album thugh."
4,Fresh,"The Album is good. Has some great beats, nice lyrics, and she puts alot of heart into her singing. I'm not going to hate on her for crossing over and ""not staying true to her roots."" She's crossing over to mainstream, and this album is a good start. Later she can bring more latin spice into the mix. Worth the purchase"
3,WHAT THE [Heck] IS THIS??,"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF THALIA SINCE SHE WAS 10 YEARS OLD, I GREW UP LISTENING TO HER MUSIC AND WATCHING HER BECOME THE SUCESSFUL SINGER SHE NOW IS, BUT, WHAT HAPPEND HERE??? THIS CD IS HORRIBLE, RUSHED AND UN-ORIGINAL IT SOUNDS LIKE 'EVERYTHING'THAT IS OUT THERE AND WHY ARE HER PRODUCERS AND HUSBAND TRYING TO MAKE HER AN R&B; DIVA??? WE HAVE PLENTY OF THEM AND WAY TO MANY TO RE-CYCLE AND FORGET ABOUT.THALIA SOUNDS AND LOOKS (SPECIALLY IN THAT VIDEO WITH FATJOE) LIKE NEWYORICAN SLUT AND SHE IS NOT,FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! WHERE IS THAT POWERFULL LATIN WOMAN ENERGY ANTHEMS, THOSE TRACKS PACKED WITH LATIN-HOUSE BEATS, THE GREAT LYRICS ABOUT BEING PROUD AND LOUD ABOUT WHOM YOU ARE?SOMEONE SLOWED THE BEATS DOWN AND IN THEY WAY, THEY KILLED HER CHANCES TO BECOME THE INTERNATIONAL STAR THAT SHE DESERVES TO AND SHOULD BE.WHO EVER GAVE THE OK FOR THE RELEASED OF THIS CD, SHOULD BE FIRED FROM HIS OR HER JOB!"
2,Thats not Thalia !!!,"Well. First I thought, wow Thalia will sing in english, why not. But I can say that this Record is not her best. I love really her music, but it is not her style. Where is the Rhythm and the flair?? All songs have the same style. RMB sounds and Thalia's voice NO!!I hope its her one and only Record in english. The first 10 songs are in english. The other five songs are the same like five of the first ten songs, only in spanish. Sorry Thalia, come back to your roots. You can sing in english but dont lose your style."
4,"A Little J. Lo, But All Together Thalia","This is a CD that you have to listen to a couple times before you actually feel her style. The first song on the album features Fat Joe, but this song doesn't reflect the feeling of the rest of it. There are a couple slow 2nd rate love songs and a couple of hip-hop feeling ballads. It's basically a CD to play when you feel like dancing around in your house with your socks on or having a girls only sleepover. Worth trying, but you might want to listen to it before you buy it."
4,Thalia is the best!,"Thalia is the best! Her new cd is really great althought I prefer her singing in Spanish.My favorite songs are I want you,misbehavin,another girl,tu y yo english and toda la felicidad."
2,Colorless as the album cover,"What is a Latin superstar married to a hotshot producer to do in order to break into the overcrowded American pop music market? Why, make an English album of course. Despite my limited espanol, I've been a Thalia fan for quite a while. Her latest crossover album, however, is bland and uninspired. Her best songs are still sung in Spanish, because they were delivered with the confidence and sureness that the English songs lacked. It is a real pity that, nowadays, an artist have to sing what she thinks the public likes and not what she's good at in order to sell records. We've seen it all too often before with Shakira, Paulina and even America's own Jewel (Kilcher). At least those records aren't bad. I guess I'll just go back to listening to Juanes and Fey."
2,Diva (Fill in the Blank).....,"J.LO, Ashanti, heck even Kylie Minogue...the comparisons are apparrant and justifiable. The most important thing to be remebered, in fact the only thing that should be said about this album is this...It lacks personality!!This, coming from an artist who's known to inject that ""special little something"" into her music! What made her previous releases so compelling was the fiery, sharp-witted, self assured delivery and soul that was so full of life and joy. She seems to be going through the motions on ALL of the ENGLISH tracks, not till you get to the second half of the disc, the SPANISH half, do you sense why Thalia is one of he biggest stars in Latin America, making this relase all the more disappointing. for what its worth, the pictures in the booklet are GORGEOUS...."
4,It's kind of good,"This ablum is okay, but I think that people who are very interest in Latin music will love it so much. But if you wnat to buy and CD that does not contend beats...please select another CD. The most update song in this CD is ""I want to""- featuring Fat Joe. But after I don't like it that much because maybe I am not really interest in listening to Latin music...but it is good enough. I think you might want to try it!"
1,What happened?,"Did Thalia just turn 15.....I discovered Thalia a few years ago and have been blown over by her last few albums. More fun than Shakira, more of an artist than Paulina....but what is this crock? I feel like I bought a new CD by Mariah or Christina...not my beloved Thalia. And what is with this new look...she serious looks 15! And since this is her 10th CD I am sure that she is a few years older than that.....Thalia....I want the old you back!"
1,Thats not Thalia !!,"Well. First I thought, wow Thalia will sing in english, why not. But I can say that this Record is not her best. I love really her music, but its not her style. Where is the Rhythm and the flair?? All songs have the same style. RMB sounds and Thalia's voice NO!!I hope its her one and only Record in english.The first 10 songs are in english. The other five songs are the same like five of the first ten songs, only in spanish.Sorry Thalia, come back to your roots. You can sing in english but dont lose your style."
1,WHAT A DISMAY?,I ACTUALLY GOT DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS NEW ALBUM SHE BETTER STAY SINGING IN SPANISH. I DON'T LIKE IT ITS A WASTE OF TIME LISTENING TO HER.SHE'S JUST ONE THE OTHER TRYING HARD.
1,"She is a real disaster, but at least is beautiful","The CD is really bad, the lyrics are bads, she doesn't have voice, the music is anything but original, but I have heard worse cds. Actually this is better than the english cd of paulina rubio. At least Thalia look very beautiful in the cd, so you can buy to help her and forget about the music."
1,Typical Thalia material,"Rip-off material with little substance - typical Thalia. This diva is no singer (and no actress either). This material probably wouldn't even make it on a J-Lo or Paulina Rubio production. Nevertheless, even if it's critically trashed and a commercial flop the U.S., the Mexican press will, as usual, turn a blind eye and deaf ear (as they've often done with everything she does)and hail her as a crossover hit, money talks and Tommy M has that along with enough clout to force that kind of publicity. But to be fair her English pronounciation is good. One star, take away her ""singing"" and perhaps I'll add 2 more."
1,she sucks big time,i got 2 spanish cd of her in both suck!in what is she trying to do be the next j-lo will she cant she has no ass in is very ugly her voice sucks i would kill someone instand of hearing her sing in english dont buy this cd
5,Love it!,"Great album. Thalia delivers in English and a few in Espanol. Nice groovey beats with her pretty, sexy voice. Reviews are usually based on expectations and I got what I wanted. Others might have been better served by listening to the snippets available for each song. I only needed to listen to two before I knew I wanted the album. I think people who didn't like the album can be a bit melodramatic. If you don't like this style of music and can't do a little homework before you purchase then it's really on you. Thalia is great in English or Espanol. Can't wait for her next album."
2,Maybe Next Time Thalia,"One thing I must say I think that it was great that Thalia would switch over to english. I think my problem with this album the most was the lyrics and sme beats that sounded similar to other artist that had hit songs out at the sametime. On one song she sang about ""I can do this, I can do that, I can pull a rabbit out of my hat""......Ummm ok. Then ""I don't need no rock to be off the block"" I think she was trying to mock Jennifer Lopez. On the track ""What's It Gonna Be Boy"" that song sounded oddly fimilar to Brandy's ""What About Us"". I think the lyircs were not strong. She was just ryhming to ryhm. There was no feeling or heart into it. I think maybe next english album she should put more heart into the project instead of just singing in english. I've had this album for years now but it's going to the donation pile."
1,I hate it!!!,"I prefer to listen Shakira, or Paulina, or Natalia Oreiro... or the original Jennifer, but Thalia -en english- is terrible !!"
2,Not the best crossover album,"All I can say is that Paulina Rubio Can Breathe Normally Again. She is still Mexico's Hottest offer to date. Who needs to buy Thalia's album when we could get Dangerous in Love, Chapter II, and Mya's new album to hear the same with a better-trained voice.Thalia says "" Nada "" with this album."
1,THALIA ENGLISH DEBUT WITHOUT MUSICAL PERSONALITY,"Musicly, this compilation has nothing new and exciting to offer, she is an entertainer that has no direction, the only virtue she has, is her beauty and her ability to make people feel sorry for her, trough her constant media exposure, fake news about her personal life and excesive publicty.Her musical career has gone nowhere after marriying to mogul Mottola, ex of Mariah carey, the difference is that Mariah has a REAL voice. Thalia's english debut is the less Thalia cd, trying to sound to Minogue or Lopez or Rubio.Another quality of this latin star is to do FARSE in the spanish soap operas, her career is a complete farse, a REAL PRODUCT. Honestly i would not buy this HITS not even download it from internet, it may cointain a virus.But she still PRETTY. Kisses Thalia and all her fans."
1,"It gets worst as her ""career"" goes on!","One of the worst albums ever released, Thalia tries extremely hard to gain the American public. Her songs have weak lyrics, her voice sounds like a kitty being strangled and the r&b beats are fake. This is a true waste of studio time, composer time, and our time. True waste of plastic, paper, and energy. Spend your money on something else, as this is a true hit& miss by the very untalented Mrs. Motola."
5,Greate Cd!!! Great Thalia!,"Oh yeach, It's the best Thalia's album! I hope, that I WANT YOU, her new single from ""THALIA"" will be the biggest hit of the Summer! Go Thalia Go !The best tracks on the album are ""Closer to you"", ""Don't look back"" and ""Save the day"". I love this album it's better than the 2002 Thalia (but ther's nothing better than 'No me ensenaste')."
2,closer to.....................crap,"This is thalia's second full english album. the first one was released only in Philipines and on it was included some tracks in english. this album lost all Thalia's scent, this is not her typical music, her spanish album THALIA is her best work to date. This english album failed on sales everywhere it only came gold in mexico (70.000 copies) and failed on the us (180.000 copies sold) in Japan came gold too . but that's itPaulina's Border girl sold more that 1.5 million copies and the truth is she did'nt left her roots back , she used them on her english debut, at least better than thalia.(Border girl became Gold in the us more than 600.000 copies sold) so don't waste your money on this mediocre release, instead buy the spanish version wich is excellent"
1,The worst crossover...,"MTV Latin American named Ricky Martin as the most successful crossover artist in Latin America, that has opened the doors for the young wave of latin pop singers. Enrique Iglesias came second, for being the most talented of the crossovers. Then Shakira and Paulina Rubio, the first one for being the most successful female, and the second for being the first Mexican crossover. Thalia did not made the list and was named the worst crossover out of all, and was called the unofficial mexican edition of Jennifer Lopez. She only sold 180.000 albums in USA and only have a million worldwide."
2,hmmm....,"Okay, now I'm puerto rican and I'm sorry but I see nothing going for this album. I like the three first songs 'I Want You', 'Baby, I'm in Love' and 'Misbehavin' but that's about it. She doesn't suck, I mean she did good for a first English album but she can do better. And for that one person, Thalia isn't ugly at all. She probably looks better than you but yet I don't judge women. In conclusion, it sounds like it went from J.Lo to Britney."
5,Love Vietnam,"This book is very great for who had exiled and escaped from the communist (I hate Communist). I like this book because it tell me everything about Vietnam, i can see landscape, cities, and more and more..."
4,Good product,"This is a cool looking piece...I was hoping that the effect would be more pronounced, but it;s a neat sound!"
2,dano slap echo pedal,"this pedal is awesome!!! when it works this is the second one since i had to send the other one back because it only made feedback noise. this one does the same thing after i play it 4 10 minutes or so kina junky but when it works it really sounds good. i guess i'll try to have to find another model that works better. to bad it squeels like that its like a wire is crossing in it or something, don't know how to fix it."
3,Echos of dissapointment,"I watched a guitar training video of Jimmy Dillon who was talking about his set-up in which he uses a Danelectro Slapback Echo unit. However, trying to find that particular unit to purchase myself was a bit like hunting for the proverbial needle. I did find this unit and sent for it hoping it would be similar. Try as I might, and I have spent hours doing just that, I cannot get anywhere near the results that Jimmy Dillon suggests and can only surmise that there are far less similarities between the two than can be judged without trying it first. That is my advice to anyone else thinking of buying this echo FX box; find some way to try before you buy."
2,Where is the sand paper,"After reading reviews on the poor quality of the hook and loop model 333, I settled on the adhesives back model 334. The local hardware store and the home depot don't carry the 5"" 5 whole paper. The only place to buy the sanding disk is here on amazon.com. Porter cable didn't supply a device for punching holes in the whole less paper. I guess I could by a paper whole punch and make my own holes. To do again I would by the model that uses standard sheet paper and the unit also comes with a paper punch. The manufacture recommends not to leave the paper stuck to the pad for long periods of time. You can't take the same disk on and off to many times. The best part of this model is the suction created from the spinning for the dust collection."
1,"Genesis: Translation and Commentary by Robert Alter (Kindle Edition - Sep 17, 1997) - Kindle eBook",Was enjoying Mr. Alter's work but this Kindle Edition is so full of errors I got frustrated and returned for a refund.I wonder that authors don't make an attempt to ensure their works published via eBooks are free of blatant errors such as paragraphs being cut off and pages being out of order.
1,Excellent Translation - but a better deal is available,"This translation is wonderful - but note that it appears to replicate Genesis in ""The Five Books of Moses: A Translation with Commentary"", also by Alter. I have the full version, and the pages I compared in the preview are identical. Don't buy this edition - but definitely buy the full version for little more money."
5,Stunning,"A revelation for the first time as well as 100th time Genesis reader. It honors the Hebrew language, articulates the beauth and poetry inherent in Genesis, andclarifies with fidelity uncertainties and puzzles in the narrative. For bothbelievers and agnostics this becomes divine literature."
3,Genesis Translation and Commentary,I don't think that the author has achieved all that he claims. His translation is quite similar to the New Revised Standard Version which I use. The introduction was apparently aimed at highly educated scholars. It was necessary to keep a dictionary at hand to decipher the writing.Mr. Alter does provide some informative footnotes which I have not found in other materials.
2,Genesis,"Genesis is a difficult read in many ways. The writing style is over a thousand years old, this combined with the density of the material makes it a very time consuming read. The text requires a lot of analyzing and critical thinking while reading. While it is a hard and dense read, in the end it is a very rewarding one. You cannot claim to have an understanding of literature until you have read Genesis. Being one of the first true texts and the guide to life for many, many great novels have drawn connections both to and from it. Robert Alter's translation of one the greatest texts ever written is magnificent. He uses a great deal of footnotes to help in the translation and explain the old Hebrew. Genesis is truly a work of art."
1,Alter's book deserves better than this (ebook version specific),"Alter's translation of Genesis is superb and he provides an exhaustive level of insight into the source material. Too bad the publisher didn't treat such scholarship with a little more respect--this Kindle version is appallingly bad. Typos, bizarre alignment issues, improperly placed footnotes and a lack of definitive page numbers go well beyond the typical ebook translation errors. This should not be sold in its current ebook format. I will be asking for a refund.DO NOT BUY THIS IN EBOOK FORMAT"
5,Well Done.,"One can judge a translation by the vividness of the characters, the careful delineation of the moral issues, and the reasonableness of the choices the translator makes. Alter has done a wonderful job bringing GENESIS to life. The moral dilemmas facing Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph are deciphered from a nuance in the language or the placement of a noun or verb. The notes reveal a translator in full mastery of his material, though at times the discussion becomes a little too technical. Nevertheless, this is a great achievement. Recommended."
4,Good but could have been better,This was a good book. But if you're looking for juicy stories you won't find many (if any) here.
2,Could have been so much more.,"I bought this book because I love hockey. I am a player, coach, board member, and on-ice official. It was mediocre at best. Given the amazing experiences and long history of the subject this could have been so much more. Unfortunately, I hear better stories at our local board meetings than I got from this book. Disappointing."
1,A big let down...Scampy held back,"I really looked forward to reading this book over the Christmas holiday.However, it's very painful for me to say that this book was a complete and total let down. Based on Scampy's tenure in the NHL, I would have expected so much more, but Scampy held back. Clearly, Scampy didn't want to do a ""tell all"" book, but this book was so poorly written and organized with weak stories and annecdotes. Scampy certainly had better material that he could have shared with us. Perhaps I can't blame him for not wanting to get into more details on topics the average hockey fan would want to know.Scampy was the best linesmen I ever saw and his career spanned so many years. It's just too bad the book did not get into the level of detail and stories that Scampy must surely have filed in his memory banks that we all would have enjoyed reading."
5,Exceptional Results First Time,"Putting the 810-7080-8 together took about 45 minutes using the tools suggested in the instruction booklet (flat head screwdriver, pliers). I plugged it in and let it 'burn off' or 'season' the smoker as suggested (degassing any solvent, etc. left by powder coating, painting, etc). The next day I tried a pork loin roast and half a brisket (with an herb/seasoning rub) on the lower rack (just above the water pan) and a whole chicken on the top rack with mesquite chips soaked for 2 hours. The smell from the deck was incredible! After 3 hours, I had soaked more chips and added to the lava rock bed. 7 total hours (brisket was probably finished after 4; it was a little overdone) the chicken was the best I've ever tasted and the pork was just about as good (the cut was a little fatty on the inside; no fault of the smoker). I can't wait to try the smoker on ribs next time."
5,Sweet deal.,"I, like many, was planning on building a terra cotta smoker after seeing Alton Brown's demo online.When I got to Home Depot to purchase supplies, I found this smoker for $79.00, which is probably just about what I would have spent making my own, or even less.I read all the reviews and a lot of people complained that it got too hot or not hot enough. Mine held 250 perfectly for the 12 hours I smoked my first pork shoulder and two racks of ribs.Couldn't be happier. Great product, especially for the cost.Also, one of the grates had a loose bar that was close to breaking off when I opened it. I sent a quick note to Brinkmann and within a few days they informed me that a new grate was in the mail. Great customer service."
4,Great smoker but....,"The electric element will eventually burn out. A replacement can be purchased, but they are somewhat hard to find and are about $30. Look online to find one. Otherwise, the smoker does a great job on about any meat. Keep water in the pan to regulate the temperature. Brinkman claims the smoker maintains a constant 250-degrees. Briskets, chicken, ribs all turn out perfect. You can also use a grill directly over the burner to grill hamburgers."
4,good entry level,"This is a good entry level smoker. The price, compared to Lowes, is about 2x more here. I got this smoker as a gift and after a few tries I'll say this - once you smoke, you'll never want to go back to grilling. Preparing the meat (see brine recipe) and controlling the temp is the key to making it great smoked food. Make sure you monitor meat temp to know when to take it off the smoker.Some cons:- The smoker is alittle flimsy. Mine came shipped slightly bent so the cover is sometimes not on all the way. I'm sure a more expensive smoker will be better made.- The heat is hard to control and takes some practice. A better grill may provide more of a means to control temp more. Using charcoal, not gas, will take more practice.I would probably spend more $ to buy the weber smoker rather than this one had I bought it but if you want an entry level smoker to try this is a good start but find a better price."
4,Excellent Smoker,"This is an excellent smoker for the amount of money that we paid for it. We smoked a ton of meat and and it turned out really good. One suggestion, make pre-made aluminum foil packs of soaked wood chips to ensure constant smoking about every 2 and 1/2 hours."
3,Nice but missing parts,"Took about an hour to assemble while watching TV. Ended up it was missing a part that holds the rack (V Clip). I called Brinkman to get a replpacement part but they never returned my calls. I emailed them and finally got someone there to order the part for me. Now, just waiting for the part to come so I can grill."
4,Still Learning,"Have had mine for a couple of months now, got it at Lowes for a great price. I went with electric so I would have the consistent temp. I am still learning how to cook with it but have had some sucesses. The chicken and pork roasts have turned out very good. I am still far from good when I attempt ribs. The only issue I had when I got this smoker was the lid not fitting very well. I understand there needs to be a gap at the top for the smoke to escape but mine needed some gentle alteration with a rubber mallet. Overall a great product, I just need more practice, practice, practice..."
2,item damaged and re-painted,"I ordered this item for my parents and had it sent directly to their house. After they had it mostly assembled, they realized the grill top has a dent in it and the water pan is dented and looks like it has been re-painted in places. Overall, the grill is still functional, but I am very disappointed to receive a damaged item (obviously not shipping damage) that was sold as NEW but looks more to be a fefurb.."
2,"Good performance, bad quality","I ordered one of these because we wanted to try smoking, but weren't ready to jump into a $300+ smoker. Our first foray into smoking was a huge hit, and the pork roast we smoked was delicious. Unfortunately, when I went to clean out the smoker the next day, I noticed there was already rust in the charcoal pan and the base. While I am sure I sloshed water when I refilled the drip pan and dripped when adding new woodchips, I certainly didn't think it was enough to result in the unit rusting after ONE USE! Very frustrating."
1,BRINKMANN'S MISSING PARTS.,"I AM REALLY UPSET. THIS ""GOURMET' BRINKMANN SMOKER DID NOT COME WITH THE 2 GRIDS TO PLACE THE FOOD ON AND I PAID EXTRA TO HAVE THE COVER. IT DID NOT COME WITH THE COVER AND GRIDS. SO MUCH FOR THE TURKEY I WAS GOING TO SMOKE ON THANKSGIVING DAT.BRINKMAN'S CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON EXISTENCE SO NOW I AM STUCK WITH A USELESS SMOKER. I DEFINETLY WILL BUY THE MORE EXPENSIVWE OTHER BRAND SMOKER.I AM VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THIS PURCHASE., WAA"
2,"Not very good for smoking, runs at 250f, no temperature control","I'm not happy with it at all. I wanted to smoke my pork loins at 180f, but it has no way to control the temperature, so it runs at 250f by design. The hotter it runs, the faster the meat is done, and the less smoke flavor it gets as a result.I should have looked more carefully at how it worked and what was included instead of just looking at the avg review number of stars."
4,Takes practice,I purchased this at Home Depot last week. I smoked a 5 pound chicken today. Hint: remove the skin. Cooking at 225-250 degrees will leave the skin rubbery. the cooking suggestions stated this chicken should cook in 5-6 hours. I used an electronic temp sensor with remote. The thigh meat (which is where you want to take a temp reading)got to 180 degrees in 3 hours. I used 4 baseball sized mesquite wood blocks that lasted the 3 hours. Chicken had a nice smoke flavor. Do yourself a favor and monitor the meat temp accordingly.
3,Brinkman Smoker - horrible packaging,"First - this smoker works pretty much as advertised. The biggest problem has to do with the packaging. When delivered, the package was partially open. Upon initial inspection, a ""ding"" was discovered on the lid that did not appear really significant. Since my wife planned upon using the smoker that day, we decided to use it. It became apparent after using the smoker several times that several pieces of the smoker were dinged enough to cause the lid to not fit correctly. This probably is the reason why it appears to take longer to cook items than expected. Although the flimsy original packaging by Brinkman certainly did not help, I believe that Amazon should have recognized the Brinkman packaging as problematic and packaged this item appropriately rather than trying to save a few pennies by using Brinkman's packaging. So - three stars for the smoker doing its job and no stars to Amazon.com for shoddy packaging and handling."
4,Great Smoker,"I have had mine for 3 years now and love it. The assembly is minimal and the seasoning prcedure makes all the parts stay in great shape. I do a fair amount of smoking of meats (weekly) and it has been performing well. I have not modified it and manage the internal heat by using the right amount of charcoal and monitoring the unit every 20-30 minutes. Having worked with experienced Pit Masters, they all say the same thing. You have to pay attention to your fire, lift the lid as little as possible, monitor the temp, add more as needed. The only downside, true for all the water-smokers (hence 4 instead of 5) is adding can be challenging but not impossible. Patience is required. Would I buy it again, yes. Most of my smoking is done between 200-225F, and it does from ribs and whole turkeys very well. Even smoked a meatloaf! MMMMMMMMMM"
1,WORST PACKAGING *EVER*,"Item arrived in a ""box"" that had two sides missing. It's a gift, so I'm just hoping that all the parts are still with the product, which is assembly required!"
3,Turkey took too long to smoke,"Can someone else comment on how your turkey turned out? I tried to smoke a turkey but after 9 hours, I gave up and finished the 15lb bird in the oven. The internal temp of the smoker stayed at 200'-230' and yet the bird's temp only reached 150'. Far less than the 180' cooked temperature required.I also noticed the thing ate wood chips. My bro-inlaw has a weber bullet smoker and only added 1 1/2 cups of soaked chips over an 8 hour period, whereas the Brinkmann smoked up 3 cups of soaked chips in 2 hours. I think it has to do with the design with the smoke escaping at the opening of the loose fitting lid.I was disappointed because I thought the Brinkmann was a great value for a low maintenance electric smoker. I returned it.Now looking at the old smokey...."
3,Smoker is great - shipping was bad,Smoker meets my needs and especially like that you can lift the smoker from the base to add more charcoal. The shipping was not good as the smoker came dented (bought one for sister and it too arrived dented). Brinkman service finally did replace both but they will not talk to you when you call - they call you back - 2+ weeks later!
3,Terrible Packaging,"Can't really review Smoker, as it is gift for son, but was very worried because when box arrived it looked like a reused, damaged and retaped box that was still unsealed in some places. Smoker appears intact so will update later as to whether the smoker works as promised. Should add that item arrived on time."
4,Worked perfectly for Thanksgiving,"I now want to try slow smoking beef ribs. Easy to put together, the fact that the coals are in their own, detached container, makes this so much easier than the older version I replaced."
3,Not as efficient as my old one,"This is a well made smoker and, if it is anything like my old unit, should last twenty years. I like the access door for adding wood and water, but the cooking chamber is so big that the heating element doesn't provided enough heat. My older unit was smaller and would smoke a full load of ribs in five hours on a warm day. This one took nine hours. A twelve pound turkey will take a good eight hours as well. Consider the shorter smoker."
2,Quality has gone downhill,"I purchased this smoker to replace the ""Cooking Cajun"" smoker that I had used for over 20 years before it finally rusted out and became unusable. This smoker which is supposedly a ""step above"" in quality from the ""Cooking Cajun"" is much ""tinnier"" and does not fit together tightly. There is actually a gap of about 1/4 inch around the top and the body. The steel is also of a MUCH thinner gauge.My recommendation, shop at a retail store first before ordering any smoker from Amazon. On the positive side, shipping was fast."
2,Quality Control,"The smoker came with a bent handle that i had to straighten out and one of the grill prongs is not attached on one side. Very disappointing, I love the smoker and it works great, but buy it from the brinkmann website"
1,"Worthless, save your money","I agree with the above reviews. I am using it as we speak (Thanksgiving 07) & it sucks. It is hot for about an hour, then drops off. I will be fighting it all day. I'm sure that we will end up outting the bird in the oven."
5,who should test?- use the checklist!,One of the best things about this book is a handy checklist for who should be tested for celiac.One of the celiac support groups has posted this to the web:[...]
5,The Best Book on This Subject,"Get this book first if you think you might be having a problem with gluten. I haven't read any other book that is better than this one. Easy to read, and gives all the information you are going to need to get diagnosed correctly, as many doctors don't understand how to diagnose celiac or gluten sensitivity. You can take this book with you to the doctor and avoid arguments- Dr. Green is a top doctor in his field at Columbia University Medical Center, so your doctor should give weight to what he says. If you are newly diagnosed, this book will also provide you with a good understanding of the process of the disease and how to manage it."
4,Celiac Disease : A Hidden Epidemic,"This is a very informative book - I learned a good bit about celiac disease that I didn't know. Dr Green has really helped the celiac community with this book, especially the newly diagnosed. It is right up there with other helpful books I've read since I have been diagnosed."
5,Celiac Disease: A Hidden Epidemic,An excellent explanation of the disease and how to follow a gluten free diet. Helpful as a reference when friends/family don't fully comprehend the need to be strictly gluten free. I highlighted certain passages and gave the book to nonbelievers to read.
5,"Comprehensive, well written and human","Having multiple food intolerences that went mis-diagnosed for years, I am quite familiar with this genre of writing. From this background, I will unequivocably say that this book is incredible. It gives a wealth of information about celiac disease specifically as well as a much-appreciated, comprehensive overview of the background to it--the complexity of the digestive systems and how they work and can go wrong. It is written beautifully with a blend of anecdotes and scientific fact that is a pleasure to read. The authors are obviously very familiar with the difficulties, stress, and pain that can accompany all stages of learning of and living with a gluten-free diet. It's tone is honest, extremely positive, and uplifting. I recomend this book to all interested in this topic, celiacs and non-celiacs alike."
4,Great Game But Too Short,"Ocarina Of Time is a great game but it is to short. There are only about 9 levels, but each is challenging. The great thing about this game is turning into an adult. The game is more fun when you are an adult. Even though they arent that many levels the game still took me a long time to beat. The only down side of the game is some parts are really hard. The water temple in my opinion is the hardest level because you have to find too many keys. Some parts in the shadow temple are hard too. Overall it is a great game and when you beat it you will want to start the whole game over and beat it again."
4,"Good, but VERY difficult","Its a really good game. Great for people 11 or older. I got it when it came out when I was 8. I couldn't even get through the first dungeon without my cousin and his strategy guide. I just recently got it out again and played it. It was MUCH easier. In short, the perfect game for teens and/or if you have a strategy guide, not as good if your little."
4,"Great game, probably one of the best","There isn't much you can say that is bad with this game. For it's time it had excellent graphics, excellent game play and sound. This game is truly one in a million that I am sure any person can enjoy, BUT, if your a Zelda fan (and have played all if not most games from the beginning) you'll notice some of the things in OOT are recycled. For example, the Kakariko town music is completely recycled from Zelda: A Link to the Past. In fact this game borrows a lot from Zelda: A Link to the Past, though they do manage to change some things in OOT here and there. Still for what it's worth Zelda: OOT is still a pretty darn good game, though I think the story should have been more original."
2,It's just not Zelda,"While this game does hold together on its own, it just isn't Zelda as we know it. It's far too dark and serious, and the playing style is nowhere near the first four Zelda games. Those of us who remember the early NES Zelda games as children and teenagers will be heartbroken after being exposed to this game.On another note: How did Ocarina of Time get an ESRB rating of E? After playing this game and feeling how dark it is, I think it should get a rating of T (teens and up) instead."
5,HOLY MOLY!! THE PERSON WHO WROTE THE REVEIW JUST RIGHT BELOW ME IS RIGHT!,"This game IS fun! The reveiwer below me, I took his advice... AND I DIDN'T REGRET IT!! I'm addicted so much that I'm already on the Shadow Temple boss, Bongo Bongo, on the same day I got this game! I love this game like a wife! NOTE: Bongo Bongo is a really tough boss. He's the toughest boss so far... I still haven't beatn him!!"
5,THE ULTIMATE GAME!,"There are no words to describe this game,it's simply perfect! It's surely THE BEST GAME EVER! In any console!I don't know where to start from!The great graphics!,the beautiful music,the amazing gameplay,the awesome story,the magical places that LINK goes to?EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME IS PERFECT! The only bad thing about it is that you can't get the Triforce(probably).Plus that it will take you ages to finish it! This game is really HUGEEE! It makes Tomb Raider look like a fuzzy and realy old stupid cartoon! Banzo Kazoie doesn't stand a chance and Mario is nothing compard to THIS! I would rate it with 1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 if I could! That's all I have to say about this game,it's just perfect! Simply a masterpiece! The sales say so!Almost 10.000.000 copies all over the world are sold until now! And still going! Ohhh and don't forget the new Zelda game that comes out this November and it's calledThe Legend of Zelda:Majora's Mask"
5,Forty-something housewife really liked Zelda!,"I became hooked on RPG's playing ""A Link To The Past"" on SNES. ""Ocarina of Time"" is a worthy follow-up. In brief, if you liked ""Link"", you're going to love the added depth, difficulty, and improved graphics of ""Ocarina"". Not too difficult for first time players, nor too graphic and scary for children, yet interesting and challenging enough to entertain older, more experienced players for many hours. Riding a virtual horse is great fun! Use the rumble pack if you've got it. You may want to make sure you have the game book handy though if you want to enjoy everything the game has to offer since some of the clues are obscure and certain items would only be found by chance if you didn't know they were there."
4,Not as good as the hype,"I got this game because every person said it was the best game ever. For 1998 it is, but now it's just good. Not as good as wind waker or twilight princess. The level design is good. Parts are 3d, others are resident evil camera. In short it works okay, but I screwed up many times becaus of it. the graphics were good several years ago, but now they are muddy and polygonal. Aside from that, it's zelda. Nothing new. If you buy it, don't expect it to live up to all the hype."
5,Nintendo's Best,This was actually purchased by my son and he says it is simply THE best game Nintendo had for the N64
5,This is a 10 star game.,"Beyond a shadow of a doubt this is the best game in the world.Link is back and beter than ever.His adventure in Ocarina of Time has to be the best yet.The graphics on this game are awesome.The role playing gets you caught up.You have fun fighting spiders,dragons,witches,hands,phantoms,and monsters 20 times your size.You have time traveling.You have buying and selling goods.The fun in this game never ends even after you have beat it.This is just an over all good game.You have to buy this one before any other."
5,The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time review,"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is an excellent game for any age. Kokoris are humanlike creatures. They thrive in a forest. If they leave the forest, they will die. Kokoris have their own fairies. One Kokori named Link, does not. One night he has a terrible dream. He is outside a castle one stormy night when a princess comes by with someone else on a horse. They run past. A man in clad black follows. He asks Link which way they went. Link drew his sword but he was knocked out. Then he woke up. A fairy, called Navi was there. She took link to the Deku tree which created the Kokori. A curse was put on it. Link went inside and broke the curse. He was told that he was not a Kokori, but a Hylian. The Deku tree died.This game has wonderful 3D graphics. The storyline is great. The animation isn't jumpy."
5,Best Game Ever is an Understatement,"Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the Greatest game ever. It has incredible graphics, awesome sound, and perfect play control. The Story, although Generic, is done very well and is the main factor that draws you back to the game. You will have fun coming back and playing this game long after you have beaten it. If you arent one of the 8 Million people who already own this masterpiece, then you should be."
5,"a legendary game, timeless fun.","This game is one of the finest Video games ever produced, while its graphics may be some what dated by today's standards its epic story and play control are arguably better than many of today's titles.I cannot recommend this game enough."
5,Best Game Ever Made,"Amazing. This one word completely wraps up this game. Everything about it just stuns anyone who plays it. The soundtrack is one of a kind. The game play was the first of its kind. I played this game when it came out, and i still come back and play through it. You can never get enough. It was voted Best Game of the year by several notable magazines and other company's. The lowest rating it got from everyone who rated it gave it a 97.48%. You can never go wrong with this classic and what i would say is the Best Game Ever Created. Thank you Shigeru Miyamoto for creating such an amazing game and experience!"
5,Simply the best game,"Everything about this is perfect. The only thing thats wrong with it is the occasionally un-translated background item or so, but that takes nothing away from the game. The controls are easy to learn and fun to master; the graphics are amazing; the music and sound is great, but all that would be useless, unless the game also had a great story. In the editorial review the pro that the game is light-hearted and so on is right on the mark. I had fun, but I was challenged. I can find nothing to critize, but much to praise, too much to fit in here."
5,NICE NICE,"YA hEarD meThis game is excellent. TOday is 10-11, and I purchased this game at least5 or 6 months ago and I am still playing. Everything in this game was great, and the graphics and music are true masterpieces. Anyone who likes Zelda, or even people who don't particularly like it should go out and purchase or rent the game."
4,fun!,"I have zelda at home and i thought it was really bad at the start because me and my brother couldn't even get past the first level. But once we passed the first level we started to think it was really really good. Once you get the hang of it it is easier because my 5 yr old brother is now able to pass most of the levels. It has good graphics and is challenging but not so challenging that you want to give up, if you are unsure about this buy it because the violence is not that bad at all."
5,The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - Pure Dungeon Fun!,"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is definately a must-have if you have a Nintendo 64 Video Game Console.Pros:- Explore dungeons- Collect weapons for battles- Won the 1999 game of the YEAR!Cons:NO CONS!Graphics: 9/10Gameplay: 10/10Sound : 10/10Music : 10/10Difficulty: Medium to HardIf you don't have this game for your N64, You're missing all the fun!"
5,One of the Best Games Ever,"From the moment you first wield the Kokiri sword to the time of your final battle with Ganandorf, this game is amazing. As you explore and battle as Young Link you learn about the controls and characters of the game. Than playing as Link really kicks it into overdrive. The puzzles are harder, the monsters tougher, and the bosses can be very difficult. The graphics are amazing for the N64. The landscapes are all majestic. The music is classic. I would highly recommend this game."
5,Zelda: Ocarina of Time,"Just another reason why the 64 is a pinnacle of my generation. Its challenging, has a great story, and can make you angry. But thats what the best video games do! :-) Definitely a must have."
4,LoZ OoT Review,"This game was a wonderful experience.It's a wonderful starter if you just got this as a first Zelda game, and even 13 years after the release, people are still finding things out! Wonderful graphics, amazing storyline, tough dungeons, and exclusive moves make this game a must-have.If you liked this game, I would reccomend the sequel, Majora's Mask, or the enhanced version, Ocarina of Time: Master Quest, for even TOUGHER dungeons."
5,Was hooked at first play...,"Was hooked at first play and the only thing to break the addiction was to complete the game. My wife and I played this game about 5-6 hours every night for twenty days straight until we finished it. During that time I lived in two worlds: the real world during the day and in Zelda's Hyrule at night. I loved the story line and the expansive realm to explore. I also enjoyed the passing of time within the game where different things discovered at night versus the day. Some of the puzzles were not the easiest to solve, but my wife and I have different ways of seeing things which enabled us to solve enough of them to finish the game. I would recommend this game for anyone who has a lot of time on his/her hands."
5,The Mystique of Zelda,"I've heard many people talk about how good they think Zelda is and how bad Final Fantasy 7 was. I'm gonna make this short and sweet:If so many people like Zelda because it's so awesome, so great, so unifying in nature, so incredible, so brilliant, so incredible that the game world turned on its heels and so few people appreciated Final Fantasy 7......then why is it Zelda 64 hasn't been converted to a PC version? Surely the PC players who don't own N64s are ""dying to play Zelda"" right? It's probably within the realm of acceptability that Zelda could run fine on a Pentium III system. The demand to convert the game must be incredible, right?Wrong.Zelda 64 wasn't as good as we all hoped it would be. And the PC conversion spot is only reserved for the most popular games.Looks like Zelda failed."
5,Zelda is the best ever!!,"When I first heard about The Legend of Zelda Ocaraina of Time, I thought that it was some stupid game that would be too hard or too easy. But then I rented it over and over and over again until I bought it! It was awsome. The graphics are wonderful, the temples are beautifuly desighned, and the colors just put me in awe. But, as you get older, the worlds get harder and harder to conquer. You must collect keys, and beat bosses of all kinds. You can talk to the many different races of Hyrule, and ride the wild horse Epona. You will learn many different songs on your ocarina, and earn many different weapons. You must collect (well you don't have to) hearts to keep up your energy, and visit the Great Fairy of Power to get spells that will help you in your journey to defeat Ganondorf and save Hyrule. If you arn't planning on buying this game still, then you should at least rent it!"
5,Best ever!,"It is a great game I just got it Christmas 1999 and I love it!The Gorons,Zoras,and Kokiris are so cool."
1,The harbinger of Zelda's downfall,"This is the installment with which started the hideous trend of decay in the Legend of Zelda series. The number of good games to which the Zelda label applies, currently totals 4 (I'm talking about the first four, natch). The others are pure [crud], and I blame OOT for starting it all. It and Majora's Mask are guilty of the first cardinal sin of Zelda: setting it in a 3-D environment.It does NOT belong there! (As for the ""Oracle"" series, it's guilty of the first cardinal sin of RPGs: don't ever let Capcom create an RPG. But that's another story.)Really, I ask the world, what in the name of all that is holy was Miyamoto thinking when he conceived the idea of a 3-D Zelda game??"
1,horrible game,this game is one of the worst games ive ever played. i dont see anything good about it. it has awful graphics repetitive gameplay frustarating controls. i cant even metion one good thing about this overated [stuff]. youre in an ugly cave with dumb... bad graphics trying your pueny little knife a billion times at a monster. the controls are bad the sound irritating and the graphics disgusting. everything abuout this game is terrible. and why so many people like it is far beyond my comprehension. it is irritating repetitive lacking looks like ... . and has you doing the same thing 1000 times in one little cave. i have to say this is the most overated game in history. dont buy or rent this trash dump your n64 and get a playstation 2 fools.
5,Wonderful Game! :-),"Hello, this is a girl who luvs video games. Video games are life to me, so you'd better believe what I'm saying. This is a wonderful game for those of you who are older than 7. It is quite puzzling, but it is still my favorite N64 game. It's been my fave since the day it came out."
5,Addictive and fun for everyone.,"I'm probably not the typical video game player, a 38-year old mother of two daughters, but I must admit that I absolutely enjoyed ""Zelda, Ocarina of Time."" My daughters loved it too; we played it as a family with each of us trying to help the others. We have had hours and hours of family fun. There is some violence but it is fairly mild and there is no gore. I recommend this game to anyone of any age and any gender."
4,great but confusing,great game but it can be extreemly confusing and unless you play it 24-7 you'll never understand
4,Enchanting!,"I got this on the GameCube Collector's edition and really, it's confusing how they DIDN'T make this the best game of 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003. They DID make it the best game of 1998 and 1999 but anyways, there's a master quest version out there for GameCube. The sites are beautiful. And when u get inside the Deku Tree, let the action/fantasy begin!"
5,My Favorite Zelda Game Ever!,"This game is so different than the beginning Zelda games which were obvioulsy great as they are now classics. Ocarina of Time utilizes every button on the N64 controller which makes the controls fullfilling and easy. There are so many extras that make this game amazing. (My favorite is Epona and not having to walk all the time!) Being able to be grown up link, who considering the fact that he is a video game hero is super hot, and young link who is adorable, is great. The mini tasks are fun and mentally refreshing. I have just received Wind Waker however so this, my favorite, may have to take second place."
4,still a great game,this game is really awesome. As a long time Zelda fan this is my favorite game of the entire franchise even more than the NES version.
5,Best game for N64,"This was the best game made for N64. The action is incredible, the fighting is awesome and the bosses very well created, realistic and hard. The journey through the game is adventures and the temples are fun and confusing. The graphics are stupendous and Link and Epona are awesome characters. The story in the game is very imaginetive and it gets you into it. A wonderful story about a kingdom, a princess and a hero. The Legend of Zelda will always be one of the best games made for Nintendo."
5,Great Game!,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. I love the gameplay. It was easy to control the character. I also enjoyed how it wasn't a very easy game. When a game is challenging, I play it more and more. In fact, I still play this game today. Very good game."
5,The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,I really should have the kids writing this I think they liked this game but yet there was something lacking in all the zelda games
5,Love this game.,The game came in really good condition. It works just fine and it reminds me of when I first played N64.
4,Loved it!,"Brought back a lot of fun memories, i simply loved it! And that's it. Oh, the music, the gameplay on itself. The bosses and the unique character development that won't be topped ever even with the wii and all that ""new"" stuff"
5,"Come on guys, it's not that tough","I'll tell you one thing real quick, this is the best single-player game ever made. But it's not as hard as everyone thinks. Yes the Water Temple got me a little mad at times but its not hard. Shure it's challenging but not hard. I beat this game when I was 10. Im 13 now. I have played harder games. But anyway, this game is a MUST BUY. If you don't have it, make this your next game in your collection. It got a 10 out of 10 by MANY magazines. What does that tell you? Just go buy it. You won't be dissapointed."
4,what I think of this game,"This is a great, and I repeat GREAT GAME![.]It has awesome graphics, strange yet okay sound, and the best gameplay EVER!If you don't know what N64 game to buy, I definitely recommend this game. I give it three thumbs up! (even though I don't have three thumbs.)In short, BUY THIS COOL GAME."
3,Too much thinking for a video game.,"This version of Zelda doesn't quite have the original feel of the ""Link to the Past"" game available on the Super NES. This game involves too much thinking, I look for games that are easy to pick up and are fast paced, like 007 or Perfect Dark for example. The bottom line is that this game is good for those of you who are in the mood to think and have patience."
3,"Well, good, but . . .","This was a good game. It was. If you look at it by itself, not expecting anything, it's a fine game. However, I'm something of a classic gamer, and I suppose I expected to get the Super NES version, but better. I found myself horribly disappointed by this 3-D (well, duh) thing. I suppose it is much like the Super Nes version, just 3-D . . . and I just didn't like it. If you don't like the world of 3-D gaming, you probably won't like this one. But, in the interests of being true to the Zelda series, try out a friend's. You may like it after all."
3,Sorry,"DO not get me wrong. I am one of The BIGGEST Zelda fans in the world. and I bought this one as soon as it came out with the gold cartige and all.But this Just isn't a Zelda game....Its missing the Fancy tunes, the story just doesn't seem that addictive.WHen you first get the game its great and it looks to be one of the best games. but then after you beat it.... its kinda boring...Zelda games should never get boring! Zelda NES I STILL paly that damn game.' Link Not as good as the first but still I like playing it. Zelda A Link To the pass on SNES is the BEST Zelda game.I just cannot love this game.. it did horrorble for a Zelda game."
5,Zelda is the Best Game Ever,"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is probably the best game ever made. The graphics are stunningly realistic. The environments are huge. It feels like you are actually living in the land of Hyrule. You can do many things like riding horses to catching ghosts. There are many things to do in this game. The story is so dramatic and emotional, it's hard to believe it's not real. There are many characters to interact with. And there are many enemies that try to end your quest. The AI is quite good. They can ambush you if they ever get the chance. The challenges are quite hard too. This game will take you a while to beat. Overall, this is the best game ever."
5,THE GREATEST GAME EVER CONCIEVED!!!!!!!,"Whta can I say? There really isnt much use for words when a game this perfect is released. If you don't buy this game, you need serious help."
5,Best videogame ever?,"Quite possibly, if you don't know why then you haven't played many videogames ;-)"
4,Zelda: Great Game or Confusing Peril?,"I have Zelda: Orinca of Time. Even with the strategy guide for this game, it is still confusing. I am now having to start my game over now because I did something in the wrong order and I am in the middle of the game. I'm going to have to do the game over. It is usually fun, though. But, you must take the risk of having this game be your obbsesion and talking about it all the time. It is a really great game though."
5,I will Remember the Magic,"Thinking back on the times of Zelda, have got me thinking. The game was absolutely breath taking, I remember how fun and exciting it was, and it was so good, because of the challenge. If there is still anyone who has not played and beaten this game, please get it, it is totally worth the money. Then in 4 or 5 years, you too can think of what a great game Zelda was, but then you will feel bad for neglecting your Nintendo 64 and playing your PS2, but PS2's time for neglection will come in a few years also."
5,THE GUYS WHO DON'T LIKE IT ARE JEALOUS!,"The Legend of Zelda is a GREAT game. Excellent storyline, amazing graphics, and a well thought out plot. I suggest playing and buying it....even the console system itself is worth playing this masterpiece! I read some of the negative reviews below by some weirdos like that Squaresoft supporter (please write me if you see this) and all I have to say is JEALOUS. Some people are avid fans of Final Fantasy. I LOVE FF but I hafve to give kudos to Zelda. They're completely different genres and games and to compare only shows the negativity and naivety of people like the reviews below who gave it one-two stars. How pathetic you guys are to trash such a great game. Let it stand on its own rather than comparing constantly. Just enjoy it! It's amazing."
5,MORE THAN JUST A VIDEO GAME.... A Legend!,"This title is the most incredible video game experience you could possibly imagine. The characters in it each had their own personality that you grow to love. You really grow as a game player, taking time to think carefully at each new challenge. The game's graphics were unmatched and the originality is incredible. When you finally finish, you just look back at what you started as, and how much you have developed as the Hero of Time. An N64 owner without this game has no sense of adventure. Simply, the greatest expirience on a Video game System. Truly a Legend"
5,"Watch out Ganondorf, Link is here to kick your butt!","This is the best game ever made on the N64! When my friend let me borrow it I was amazed sice the only games I had played were Golden Eye and Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire. I wish that I had the gold pak though. Great strategy. The game play is great. I suggest not using the Player's Guide until you've tried everything once. When you beat the game and you want to complete the game (i.e. getting all upgrades, Gold Skulltulla tokens, and Heart Pieces) then you should also get it."
5,This is THE best game,"This game is extremely fun. It has a good plot and storyline. It is my all time fave game for N64, and with good reason. If you don't have this game, I suggest you GET IT! It's really enjoyable and addictive. There are many many secrets etc. to find and it keeps you busy for months."
5,A Must have for Zelda fans!,This is a very fun game. You will probably spend a lot of time playing this game. The graphics rock and Link has a lot of cool weopons. I had a lot of fun while I played this game. It took me about a month to finally beat it. I would suggest buying this game if you like an adventurous game!
5,Coolest addition to the many Zelda games out there!,"I am a player and winner of all the Zelda games. Each has their own unique quality to them. Zelda64 is by far the most well put together Zelda sagas out there. If you don't own this, I recommend you go out and buy it today. ----Also, buy a rumble pack if you don't have one."
4,Great Game,"This game was a tad on the easy side for the most part, but it was still great fun. One of the best Zelda games. Cool places to explore and neat items to find."
5,The Most Fun And Most Challenging Action/Adventure Game Yet!!,"The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time is amazing!! The plot and storyline are superb (there are some cheesy moments, but not many). The graphics must be seen to be believed and the best I have ever seen on the Nintendo 64. The music is great for a video game. There are enormous bosses at the end of massive dungeons. The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time has great replay value; I have beaten it at leatst 20 times and it has not gotten old. If you are going to purchase this game, however, I strongly recommend purchasing a guide booke. A guide book is almost essential if you want to get all the extras this game has to offer, like the horse, all the heart pieces, gold skulltulas, biggoron sword, etc. A guide book is also very helpful because a few dungeons (namely the water temple) are a little frustruating if you do not know what you are doing. I hope you enjoy this wonderful game!!"
4,Pretty Challenging,I was always a fan of Zelda when it first came out for the original Nintendo. This is a fairly challenging game and I got bored with it quickly. There isn't a lot of violence in this game but I think it's too advanced for kids to play.
4,The Most Fantastic Game Ever!,"This is the best game ever made. I am not just shellshocked either! I beat this game an year ago and I still absolutley love playing it! If you ever buy a game, buy this one. Period."
5,simply breathtaking,this game will take your breath amaze you.. take you on all kinds of emotions.. i first purchased this game back when it came back in 98 i was 14 then.. and still to this day im in love with this game.. the music is memorable.. the story line even though simple still gives you something to go for.. i think the best thing about this game was finding different items .. the level bosses are really dissapointing though after a fthis game is one of the greatest games ever made a definte must play for any video game fan
4,One cartridge of nostagia coming up!,The game was all i hoped for. The game its self is in great condition no dings or scratches came earlier than expected... Arrived before the console. The game play is rad (as far as function) it doesnt freeze works just like i remember from my childhood.
5,The Best Game of All Time?,This could be the best game of all time. What else needs to be said? If you haven't played this game before and still have a working N64 you need to pickup this game. If you haven't played the game you can also find it on the Wii Virtual Console and an upcoming remake for 3DS.
2,not what its cracked up to be,"very upset over this cd, they are rerecorded songs, not the same ones from the album, lynn anderson is a great singer but she should have left them the way they were , there was no need to update such classic songs"
4,"Dark, twisted East Bay Hardcore....","""The Beautician"" is the third album for Bay Area punk band Dead and Gone. Like their previous releases, this album showcases the band's spooky, discordant style of hardcore. The music is best described as a cross between The Birthday Party and early Neurosis. This is what hardcore punk is all about: no tough-guy stuff or macho mosh parts, just fast, heavy punk rock."
5,If you don't buy this Tune you are a mug....!,This is one of the best UK dance tracks of 1998 now remixed and re-released. If your a fan of UK dance music/culture then buy this CD you wont want to stop dancing once you've heard this....believe me..!
1,Doubt this is Real Green Tea; Serving Count Inflated,"I drink a lot of fresh-brewed green and black tea and have also tried several instant versions of both. This stuff looks and tastes far more like instant BLACK tea than green. I strongly suspect that they either start with a mix containing black tea, or more likely are using very crude extraction or concentration methods that oxidize the polyphenols, producing a 'secondary' black tea extract with very little EGCG and other *green* tea polyphenols.Also, the dosing instructions claim that a half-teaspoon serving contains 0.8 g of their 'proprietary blend,' giving 156 servings per 125 g bottle; however, I weighed out a level half-teaspoon of powder using a measuring spoon and a digital scale accurate to 0.1 g, and it's actually 1.2 g, so they're inflating by 50% the number of servings a bottle provides.The manufacturer is either incompetent or dishonest."
5,The Best Trading Commodities Game Ever,"I tried persuading friends with the title, which didn't make much headway but once I they finally sat down they couldn't get up again. This game is not for the mild and timid. It is a great get to know you game because when you get loud and boisterous it seems that those awkward moments are forgot. You can also take the game on the road, minus the bell, just have players slap the table in the middle when they've cornered the market. So much fun!"
5,Loads of Fun!!!,The best game I've played in quite some time. If you live in close proximity to others be careful because the game can get very loud and roudy. Have fun!
3,Pit Game,I bought this as a Christmas gift. I have not tried it. Delivery was very prompt. The price was excellent.
5,Great Family Game!,We have been playing this game for at least 20 years. We wore out 2 games already and are on our third. It's fast paced but very simple. All ages can enjoy it. You need more than 2 or 3 to have fun so it's a great game to play when you have friends or family over. It's not a game to play if you need to keep the noise level down. It get kind of noisy!
5,Great game for ages 6 and over,This is a great game. We bought it to replace a very old set and my kids absolutely love playing it. They have some updated categories for the cards.
5,Pit is not the pits!!!!,I remember this game from a long time ago when I was a kid. I bought the updated version for our high school youth retreat and was pleasantly surprised to find that nothing had changed but the bell! The kids absolutely loved this game. They were so loud and so animated while playing that it was as much fun to watch as to play! My husband - who does not ordinarily play games - did play and had a blast! It is a great game for up to eight people and loads of fun - and you can almost imagine a day at the stock exchange!
5,Great card game excellent for all ages,"I have been waiting for a year to get this product. I played the game at my daughters home with four grandchildren - it was great fun, one of the few card games that is appropriate for all ages."
5,"No turns, constant play, barely any rules...","Pit is a great game to liven up an evening with family or friends. The rules can be quickly and easily learned and there is absolutely no waiting for your turn! The great thing about this game is that everyone plays as fast as they can, at the same time until there is a winner. END"
4,Great party game!,"This is a great game to play with both family and friends. I have played it with anywhere from 4-8 people and everytime it has been fun! Loud, exciting, and fast!"
5,Great party game,"Deluxe PitI bought Deluxe Pit for the Christmas Holidays, the ""Deluxe"" part is the bell that starts and finishes the game. I played it at a friends house on a deck that was 20 plus years old, there were about 12 of us, so we couldn't all play at one time. Our ages ranged from 16 years to 78 years and we didn't all know each other, but after a few rounds of Pit we all laughed together and clamoured for more. This is a fun and fast game for all ages (that are able to read). It's very uncomplicated and you are able to play it on the first try. I thoroughly recommend this for parties and family entertainment."
3,downgrade in the product,"I bought this game last year an I really loved so I gave it to my parents and I bought other one this month. The product I received the second time is not the same, I would say it is lower quality now since the cards are not different in color any more so it is difficult to play and not as fun anymore"
5,It Does Exist!!!,"I first played this terrific game ten years ago and have loved it ever since. A great way for kids to understand the stock market, I had always wanted a copy. I scoured toy stores to no avail and was once told by a supercillious greasy-headed know-it-all adolescent manager that ""there's no game called Pit. It does'nt exist."" (Perhaps he thought I referred to his I.Q. score) I should have skipped the hassle and come here first! Threethreethree...three cheers for Amazon!!!"
5,"A ""must have"" game for the family","I had played this when I was a kid, so when I saw it again I got it assuming my kids would like it too. Boy, did I hit a home run. I'll put it this way: we took it camping with us. 14 kids stood around a picnic table for almost 2 hours waiting for a chance to play. After bedtime, 8 adults sat around for 2 more hours having fun with it. The game can be taught to anyone in less than 5 minutes, tops. The only thing be aware of is it will get loud as people yell out their trades (if you consider that a drawback, which I don't). Overall, for the money this is a game that you have to get. It literally will make your kids more popular, as their friends will ask ""is so-and-so coming over and can he/she bring ""Pit""?"""
3,Ok game - but not as enthusiastic as everyone else !,"The family has gotten hooked by card games. We're playing mille bornes, Five Crowns, Uno, Loot, etc. We bought Pit at the same time as the other games. My 6 year old loves it the best as, like reviewers will tell, lots of yelling and trading cards. For the rest of us, including a 10 year old, the novelity wore off in a few days.Each game only takes a few minutes with 4 players. The object is to keep trading cards until you have a complete set of 9. It's not very hard to do and is mindless - just trade away the cards you don't need. The yelling and the bell does make it as fun as this game can be. But, for a longer, more involved game, with a hint of using your brain, there are far better choices than Pit. We'll still play it for laughs, but it certainly won't get the play time of the others we play."
5,A classic for all ages,"Deal the cards, start trading and try to corner the market. There are no turns, just pure pandamonium, like the commodity exchange pits! I can remember hands in which we could not go on due to uncontrollable laughter! This game is fun for adults or kids (kids who are old enough to hold cards, be quick and very vocal).I was disappointed to see this was out of stock, but there is a 'Classic Pit Tin' offered for the same price here on Amazon. The same game offered in a swank antique 'tin' box. Check it out."
4,"""Pit"" card game.","This game was loads of fun for my kids and me; ages 7 to 55 years old. Fun and exciting, fast paced and never boring."
5,Fun for People of All Ages,"Pit is a fantastic game. In Pit, you try to corner the market on different commidities such as wheat, coffee, and oats. Once you corner the market, you win that round. Not only can people of all ages play it but they can all have fun doing it. I highly recommend the deluxe version over just the standard edition. The bell is of good, regulation quality and really comes in handy when playing the game. Older people will not have an advantage over the younger kids and the game is easy to get the hang of. As stated in other reviews, Pit is not boring at all. It is a fast-paced game with tons of fun and laughter invovled. The game normally does not take very long to play. Pit is perfect to be played in parties and special occasions. Since it is easy to learn how to play, new guests will be able to indulge in all the fun. The guests will be wanting to come back to your house after playing this game. Overall, Pit is a great game everyone should have a chance to play."
2,Poor printing,"The contents of the book are as advertised, but the quality of the book and printing left a lot to be desired. Some of the pages were printed too large around the corners, and were then just folded into the book before they wrapped it up. A few of the pages were even torn, which detracts from the book. Of course for a book of this price, I expected a much more professional printing and packaging. But like I said, the actual content of the book is great, as described."
3,Not all the paintings are in the book!,I bought this book after visiting the Orsay in November 2012. I wanted a picture of one of Cezanne's still life flower vase paintings. It WASN'T in the book. Thank goodness I bought a postcard of the painting. The overall picture quality is okay. Some pictures of the paintings are blurry or look out of focus.
4,Bravo!,"Not knowing exactly what to expect when I listened to this CD for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised. It is an interesting mix of various sounds and music. The more I listened to it, the more I was able to distinguish from the different layers.I look forward to future releases by this artist!"
1,Please beware,"This book is a reproduction of the original but the size of the page has been scaled down from that of the original by almost a factor of 2. This makes the book almost unreadable as the font is too small (must be 6 pt or less in LaTeX language, definitely smaller than than the font used for footnotes in 10 pt LaTeX documents). This makes it too tiresome for the eyes. That's a real pity as it makes the book unusable (at least to me).The book is so nicely produced, with nice paper and a nice paperback cover, and sold at a very low price. The publisher could have kept the font at its original size, trimmed down the margins (quite wide here) and sold it more expensively. We would have had a very useful book at a not-too-bad price. The way things are now, the book is very expensive, as I have paid money for something that I cannot use."
5,Great Family Game. Combination of luck and skill,"My brothers, father and I have been playing Parcheese for years. After I got married, my wife and I began. Am looking for a well crafted wooded board and pieces. This is a cardboard gameboard, plastic pieces. Gets the job done, but I'd like to be playing more elegantly!"
4,parcheesi,"I have been enjoying parcheesi as long as i can remember. It is a game that takes a beating. the only thing that i would make better is the board it doesnt last as long as the pieces do. I have taught my kids alot with this game. They learned to count, to not get frustrated, and also how not to be a sore loser i think every family should own one."
2,Parcheesi is cheesy!,"Parcheesi is a fun game for 5-7 year-olds, but for anyone above that age it's a bore. Even after the first 3 or 4 games of a young child, Parcheesi becomes repetitious, and no more fun. The entire game consists of basically all luck, with a very little bit of strategy mixed in. If your idea of fun is deciding whether to move piece A forward 4 spaces or piece B forward 4 spaces, Parcheesi is certainly for you. If not, I would strongly recommend not buying this game from a store, but instead getting it for a quarter at a garage sale."
2,Lacks The Inspiration Of Her First Book,"This book is written entirely without the unique style and inflection that I cherished in her first book. It's almost as if her editor commanded her to write another book, and therefore the story and approach feel uninspired.I find her word choices slightly lazy, and even repetitive, and her metaphors, in my opinion, feel forced. She constantly compares things to natural images of the coastal South: beach, shore and marsh motifs, but it's done almost slavishly, and this gets tiresome after awhile. (Not exactly ""Pilgrim at Tinker Creek"".)Since I'm a writer myself, I may be a little more picky than other readers. Yes, I demand a lot from the books I read. And I don't think this one lives up to the reviews. Still, the story line itself is just juicy enough and down-to-earth to keep your interest. And Patti: sorry to be so harsh. I still admire your honesty and creativity as a writer."
5,Simply Outstanding,"I highly recommend this book to anyone. Especially people who feel they don't make enough money to live their dreams. This book shows you how it's not how much you make, but what you do with what you have. It is simplistic in its style which makes it perfect for one not knowing how to handle money. Giving you basic everyday principles to apply and think about. With great examples of how we take our money for granted and use it poorly and how not to. Covering setting goals, budgeting, purchasing cars, real estate, insurance, investment, traveling and more."
5,thule carrier,"This is a great carrier. We are a family of skiers. This carrier was easy to install and I have put in it two snow boards, two long sets of adult skis, two pairs of kids skis, and poles for the whole family. This allows us to take a better gas mileage vehicle skiing and still fit all of the gear, or to have room for groceries in the van when we come back down off the ski hill."
3,Review of Frontier ES,"Although identified as fitting a Highlander Hybrid, it does not. Thus new keyholes had to be drilled to install.Did not create any road noise, even at 70+ mph."
4,Practical and Accessible,"I thought this book was interesting and easy to follow. Ms. Berkson, gives us the information and practical advice on how to avoid exposure to these psuedo-hormones that disrupt the body.The print is an easy size to read."
5,very useful book,Anyone who is interested in pollution and environmental issues: read it. It is really worth your time and your attention.
2,This is NOT a 5-Star Book!,"I don't understand how the other reviewers could give this book 5 stars!The book IS definitely comprehensive.It is poorly edited. For example the author does not know the difference between effect and affect.It is repetitious. Many sentences/paragraphs are repeated throughout the book.Worst of all, it is dull.It is NOT a bad book. But it's not very good, either. Strictly mediocre."
5,Excellent summary of human anatomy and physiology.,"Phillip Pack's ""Anatomy and Physiology"" is a comprehensive and well-organized summary of the subject of human anatomy and physiology. It should be very useful for students seeking a brief overview of the subject, as well for instructors who do not wish for their lectures to be tied down to a particular textbook."
3,Got a different product,"I purchased something via serial nomber and model number. This was the item.When I got it, it was something else.The voltage was not exactly what I needed. It worked. It worked just fine. But it was not what I ordered."
1,Wrong chords,"A couple other reviewers noted that the chords here are wrong. I figured I would give the book a shot anyway, thinkin I could just transpose it or use a capo. No. I've had to pick out the correct chords and just write them in. I guess it is good ear training, but it is not why I bought the damn book. As was said before, you buy it for convenience. If you want lyrics and rhythm go ahead and buy this book, if you want to be able to play the songs approximately, but in the wrong key, buy this book. However, if you want the songs as ol' Bobby wrote 'em, this is not what you are looking for. Nor is Bob Dylan Anthology for that matter, also by Amsco. Dylan needs to cancel Amsco's rights and let Hal Leonard put out a songbook for him like they did for the Beatles. Alfred would be even better."
2,Intervals right but that ain't 'zactly how Bob plays it...,"This is a big book, and on the surface a good value -- although there are some very critical omissions IMHO.But the biggest problem I have with this book is that it's not ""as played"" accurate -- and therefore not ""definitive"". Yes, you can whip this book out and start playing and singing Dylan songs for your friends and 98% of them won't know the difference. But if you want to play them right -- the way Bob plays them -- you will have to use your ears.This is a common problem with chord/tablature books, and is not limited to this one... but what the publishers of this type of books should know is this:Anyone who is interested enough in Dylan to buy a book like this will also probably invest in a capo!"
4,Please Read!,"O.k I got this book and on almost all of the songs have the right lyrics, but i have checked on one of the songs, the song ""I Shall Be Free,"" is wrong some of it is right but most of the lyrics goes like this ""Well, the funniest woman i ever seen is the great grand daughter of mr. Clean. She Takes about fifteen baths a day, she wants me to grow a cigar-(wrong supposed to be ""Mustash"") on my face she's a little bit heavy-(wrong suppossed to be ""she's insane!"") I don't know where they got those lyrics from but they're wrong"
5,it's pretty much all here,"from ""one more cup of coffee"",(valley below)"" to ""knockin' on heaven's door"". you'll find everything you need in this songbook. a bit hard to keep the pages open,(get a big clip)and enjoy the ride song after song!"
5,I love his music,Barry Phillips teaches me new things about what it is possible for a cello to do. He has been very inspirational to me as a music student. Check out his album Trd too. It's great.
5,Maximum Historic Berg,"I would also like to add, that along with Louis Kraner's playing of Berg's Violin Concerto, which he commissioned, we have here a recording featuring the conducting of Berg's close friend and fellow Second Viennese composer Anton Webern. Here is preserved for following generations a performance of one of the signal moments in 20th-century music. To hear Webern conduct is a blessing.The recording of Berg's Lyric Suite for String Quartet is of lesser impression audio-wise than the violin concerto.Alban Berg is my favorite composer, and I'm excited about traveling to New York to see the Metropolitan Opera performance of his great opera, ""Lulu.""Michael"
3,Frees up one hand,The button to retract the leash sticks a little but gets better with use. I thought this leash had a pouch for carrying doggie waste bags but it doesn't. The flashlight is great for night walks. Wouldn't recommend this leash for anything more than a 30 lbs dog. But all in all it works OK.
3,Nifty but not great,"The flashlight on it is handy and is great for nighttime walks. However, the leash is a little too short for my liking and the locking mechanism isn't very strong (comes unlocked if my dog pulls hard enough). Great price though."
3,good leash,"I bought 3 of these, al the same. We needed a lighted leash and selected these. Functionally these are fine, the light and lock buttons could be a bit easier to operate, but hey, its a dog leash.... with a light... that works."
1,Very Disappointing,"While Ajami's analysis is engaging and literate, the author's bias shows throughout the book. Ajami refuses to call the terrorist group Hizbullah by its name, instead referring to it in translation as the ""Party of God,"" and thereby hoping to deflect the reader's attention away from the true nature of this organization. He also translates jihad as ""struggle,"" again in a revisionist attempt to bury the violence that certain sects of Islam have engendered in the name of holy war. He refuses to call the Yom Kippur War by its accepted name. Worst of all, in all of his references to the terrorsit mastermind Dr. George Habash, Ajami never once informs a reader that he is writing about a man who bombed school buses filled with children. This kind of selective ignorance has plagued many Arab accounts of the Middle East for years. Unfortunately, Ajami's work is no exception."
5,Nothing Remotely Funny Here,"Yep, I thought Ann Coulter was right. Get it? There is nothing remotely funny here, at least until you find out what ""wanker"" means. Unfortunately, ""Tomorrow"" is too good a soothsayer. The book reads of deja vu all over again. And, yet, we still never learn. A stable Iraq grows nearer... Outch! And, we still live in fear of giant lizards that shoot laser beams from their eyes. Biting humor that deserves to be printed in mainstream periodicals."
2,Very bland.,"This book isn't funny at all. Mr. Tomorrow's comics have appeared in my local paper for years, and today, in 2006, he's as predictable as ever. By the time you've read the third panel, you know what will happen in the last one. I'm all for well-done satire of the Bush administraton (see Colbert, Stephen), but this is not an example of such. I give this book two stars instead of one because there are people out there who will laugh at any attempt to make fun of the Bush administration, regardless of whether or not such ""jokes"" possess wit, humor, good taste, or freshness."
5,Funny because it's outrageous; sad because it's true.,"I'm a regular reader of Tom Tomorrow's comic online or whenever I can find a paper that carries it, so I'd already seen these comics. I bought the book because I wanted to support his work which I usually see for free. I am so glad I did. While I may have read all these comics as they came out, it is not the same as seeing them collected. There's a much stronger impact reading them together, and I'd forgotten details of many of them. Also, I really like seeing them in color.I'm constantly surprised, not to mention disturbed, at how true many of his satirical, tongue-in-cheek comments and predictions are. It's sad that the things that seemed so outrageous at one time are actually happening now, while so many people just look right past it.Definitely buy this book; you won't be sorry."
5,Hell in a Handbasket is another good'un,"Tom Tomorrow has done a fantastic job of putting humor into a political situation that one would think impossible to find humor in. ""Hell in a Handbasket"" is a further example of Mr. Tomorrow's ability to mix biting political satire with the funny bone. He can cut through much of the non-sense that is allowed to float around out there and make that hypocrisy painfully evident. God, I hope he gets some joy out of his own writing and cartooning, because I would very much hate for him to disappear from the shelves. Buy this book if you are leftie, just to keep the insanity away. Buy this book if you are a winger, just to cure yourself of the insanity."
5,Great game for the entire family,this is a game our entire family can play and enjoy; we range from ages 7-42. It's easy to learn so anyone can join in!
4,A fun game for young & old,"I purchased this card game for several members(ages 9 and up - male and female) of my family over the Christmas holidays. Most of us had never played the game before; but after figuring out the rules of the road, we had a blast, plotting to put up road blocks, accumulating miles and fixing flat tires."
5,Great Game,"This is a great, simple, easy to play and learn game. It is very fun, and very addictive. Even non-competitive people can enjoy playing it - not too much ""thinking"" involved."
2,Worst rules ever,"Nice game. Fortunately, I sort of remember how to play it from when I was a kid; the rules are frustratingly confusing and unclear. If you try to play by following the printed rule sheet, you will run into many contingencies for which you will have to make up your own rules."
5,Great Family Game,My children enjoyed this game and now I have introduced it to my grandchildren. It's easy to learn and can be played in teams or with just 2 persons. I purchased this game online as I had not seen it in stores but have since seen it in Target for $[...].
3,card game,"I did receive this in a timely manner, but I thought I was getting a card tray with the card game. The original versions which I had bought many of years ago always had a card tray included. I was a little disappointed. The game itself is lots of fun and timeless."
4,Great Introduction to MySQL,"As a beginner to MySQL I bought this book to gain an insight into the how's and why's of using MySQL. Overall having read the book from cover to cover ( a first for me as far as computer books go ) I can thoroughly recommend this book to anyone new to using MySQL. The layout is clear, the text easily readable, not too techie at first but still a great deal of examples for you to get up and running.The writing style is easy going but not preaching and all topics are treated in an easy to grasp manner.The only down side is that it doesn't cover programming MySQL using Visual Basic although several other languages are covered well.Overall a great book for the newbie and intermediate user."
3,Needs a new updated edition,"A very complete easily understood overview of design criteria for MySQL. A great book but sadly out of date. A new updated edition focused on MySQL 5.0+ is sorely needed as there have been so many changes from previous versions of MySQL. Still a useful relational database overview of basic MySQL design. If the book were current, a definite 5 star review but age drops the rating to 3 stars."
4,"Good for basics, not up-to-date for recent releases","As a working professional database developer/DBA, I should have noticed that every other review about this book is at least three years old, most almost four. This book was written to be used with MySQL V4.0, with look-aheads to 4.1 and 5.0. Version 5.0 has been released for almost two years now, and V6 is on the near horizon. A lot has changed in terms of optimization and feature sets. I sincerely hope that the authors will consider updating this work so that it is more current in terms of tuning and features. If you are new to MySQL, use the book as a basis for solid SQL and design principles; if you are more experienced, perhaps just reading and studying the 5.1 and 6.0 docs from MySQL AB would serve you better.Lee Parmenter, CMA"
5,"This Guide Will Help You Tame ""The Beast""","Whether you are a graduate student, intern, novice clinician,or a veteran, you know from experience that the DSM-IV-TR is a beast of a book in terms of navigation.Dr. Fauman has provided a cogent guide to help you tame this beast. What I find most helpful are the clinical vignettes and the way he attempts to tease out over-lapping, and/or mutually exclusive diagnoses. I am using this book (by recommendation) to review for my state's counselor license exam as I was told that this resource would provide more than adequate assistance for this purpose.The only downside to this text is the price. APA books are just plain bloody expensive, but like anything else, you get what you pay for. The information contained in this book while a tad overpriced, will be worth it in the long-run, I feel."
5,Great help guide,"I have a class that required this for a text, but beyond that, it's been pretty useful in correlation with the DSM-IV-TR. My item came in great condition."
4,Review.,Good read and very helpful guide.It helped me to learn the DSM 4 quickly and efficiently. I would like suggest this book for clinicians.
3,It was okay...,This book was okay but I'd recommend reading one of Jan's (Mr. Urban Legend) other books instead of this one....lame urban legends in my opinion.
2,Cult Book,"Brunvand has made himself a cult figure with his attacks on urban legends. Unfortunately, he has spawned a cult of know-it-alls who see the debunking of urban legends as the only end of folklore studies. Brunvand misses the point: people often do not believe urban legends anyways, but enjoy the clever twists of fiction. Debunking is not enough to appreciate the tales he relates."
2,"Constant jamming, though a nice looking toy","This is a very good-looking gumball machine, with a nice glass globe and metal parts. I paid the higher price for this unit because I thought it would look good, work well, and last a long time. My 5-year-old was delighted when she opened the box. The gumballs were easy to put in. My daughter used pennies to get her gumballs. After the 5th penny, the unit jammed and I had to take it apart, pry out the money, remove the gum, and finally shake it in various directions to get it unstuck. After putting the whole thing back together, it jammed after 3 more pennies. I am very frustrated that I paid so much for a toy that so quickly jams. It's ridiculous and I wish I had not spent so much money for it."
4,Good choice,"I purchased this item as a gift for my boss. I haven't given it to him yet, but I had to open up the box to check out the merchandise and it is very well made, metal and glass, NOT a cheap plastic replica. I can't wait till he opens his gift, I filled it with gumballs so that it's good to go. I give this machine two (2) thumbs up!!"
5,More Classic Cantelli,"Had Guido Cantelli not died in an airplane crash in 1956 at the tender age of 36, he would undoubtedly be known today as one of the world's most famous conductors. As is, collectors regard him as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th Century, and these vintage EMI recordings, reissued by the Testament label, show why. ""The Debussy Recordings"" collects all of Cantelli's late mono performances of the composer's works with the Philharmonia Orchestra -- two of the three ""Nocturnes"" (""Nuages"" and ""Fetes,"" 8/55), ""Prelude a l'apres-midi d'un faune"" (6/54), the Fragments symphoniques from ""Le Martyre de Saint-Sebastien"" (6/54) and ""La Mer"" (9/55). Cantelli made a surprisingly large number of recordings for EMI in the early 1950s and most of them have been reissued at some point on CD (by both EMI and Testament), yet many of them are now out-of-print. Classical fans curious about Cantelli's considerable skills should pick up this title before it suffers a similar fate."
3,Quality not so great for the price,"I bought this sheet set for my daughter and it did help her transition sleeping in her own ""big girl"" room but I am disappointed by the quality of the sheets. The colors have not run and the stitching is holding up but the fabric the sheets are made of is not very comfy at all, its actually rather rough and uncomfortable. If I was going to do this again I would buy nicer quality sheets for the same price without the characters on them and just buy the comforter, that way my little girl would still have a backyardigans looking bed but wouldn't have uncomfortable sheets =)"
4,Backyardigans Sheets,"I got these for my toddler when he gets in a ""big"" bed - to help make the transition easier. He loves the Backyardigans and wanted to play with the sheets after I opened them. He has not used them yet, but I have washed them and the colors did not run and the stitching held up. I would recommend these to others."
5,A must-have for musician Beatlemaniacs,"I love The Beatles records and have since my Dad purchased ""Meet the Beatles"" in 1966. The first records I bought on my own, as soon as I had a paper route and spending money, were The Beatles' LPs, in order of American release. I even knew the exact running time of every Beatles song and couldn't imagine that there were people in the world who didn't know every Beatles song. If you're like me, the revelation of the details of the recording of every Beatles track, as detailed in this book, will be a thrill to pore over."
5,gratebook have 2 copies of good photos goodinfo etc,hello from ca ive got 2 copies of recording sessions book i like it soft bound had hard at one but had to sell it a real good story the history of the beatles recording sessions the real story behind each track from love me do to let it be the real story of eric clapton onwhile my guitar gentlyweeps no clapton did play side by side his solo was overdubbed intothe trackgood photos etc bring it back yours ron
4,A very good reference,"This book makes a very good reference, however some of the info is not completely accurate and should be updated."
5,"Great Book, get it if you can","I have had this very cool book for over 20 years now. I got the hardcover when it came out and it is looking worn but I still love it. This paperback version came out in the late 90s and was only $9.99 at most book stores. It was on their bargain book tables and I thought about getting a new copy but never did. Now as of Feb 6 2010 someone is selling it for $129.00 new and $59.99 used, WOW!! I sure wish I had bought 3-4 of them but who knew that there would be a market price that high for this book and it's a reprint soft cover. Like I said above get this book if you can but not for these prices.I love the chronological order of each day they are in the studio putting down their classic tracks. The author is real good at describing certain things going on in the studio, studio chat and the many takes each song went through before the final. This book and the Ian MacDonald book are must haves if you want to know about how the songs came to be."
2,Won't stick to plastic,These struck me as old stock. They were quite stiff. They fell off my sheet covers right away. I imagined larger ones.
4,2000 Miles of wilderness,"When Bill Bryson decided to hike the Appalachian Trail, he clearly had no idea what such an undertaking would require. This book details the efforts of both Bryson and his out of shape, recovering alcoholic companion, Stephen Katz, as they struggle to come to terms with the scope of their challenge. Along the way, we learn about the history of the Trail, as well as bits of history and trivia about the places the trail touches. This is both an entertaining and informative glimpse of Appalachia and America, with a generous dose of humor along the way. I never particularly felt called to hike the Appalachian Trail, and now I'm certain that its not something I want to do. Luckily, I don't have to, because Bryson did, and wrote this book so I don't have to..."
3,"First 100 pages FANTASTIC, the rest? Well......","The first 100 pages or so were incredible; telling of a journey that only a true hiker can appreciate. I was so into the book; the book drew me in and kept me in for a little while, but then it deflated, kind of hte like Bill Bryson did when he decided he didn't have to do the whole Appalachian Trail but would just do parts of it, and sleep in town whenever instead of camping. He never even finishes the trail!!! I say this not to ruin the ending, but to prevent the misery. It's like he had a good story and could have told it in the first 100 pages but felt he needed to ramble just a little more. In the end, I would recommend this book...just don't bother with the end."
3,"funny, informative, and yet...","this is not a trail guide. this is most DEFINITELY not a how-to manual. this is a funny, informative book about a man, a writer, who has never backpacked before, who decides to take on the granddaddy of America's long-distance trails. a ridiculously out-of-shape, almost-forgotten friend from his past joins him. as a backpacker myself, who faintly dreams of one day trying the AT, i found the hiking narrative incredibly funny. i laughed out loud quite a few times.Bryson does frquently detour into historical anecdotes about people, places, and events that relate to the history of the trail. i was fascinated by a lot of his fact-gathering, and felt the history enriched the legend & mystique surrounding the trail.BUT, once the hikers have left the trail, the book falters. Bryson tries hard to keep the book knitted together, but the rhythm gets screwed up & even when the two misadventurers get back on their feet, it never regains the fun of the first half."
1,"horrible, negative inaccurate portray of southerners","As an avid Appalachian trail hiker, I was given A Walk in the Woods as a gift that took me four months to read because I was so angry at Bill's depiction of Southerners and condition of the trail. Bill rants about facts that he got from the Wilderness Society handbook that I have seen first hand as factually incorrect. He talked down about the people that he met and was negative about the whole journey. I had a goal of finishing the book so that I could give an honest depiction of the book. I love the trail and southern culture, and there are many great tales far better than A Walk in the Woods such as the story of the blind man who walks the whole trail,Blind Courage by Bill Irwin."
2,Boooorrrrriiiinnnnggggq,"I tried, but this is the most boring, slowest book on CD! I gave up before one disk! I haven't even tried the other two books of Brysons. The Thunderbolt Kid was great, butit seems to have gone downhill after that."
2,Poor tribute to a great place,"This is a guide for what not to do on the AT. Having hiked it myself I did not recognize much of what the author spoke about and I agree with other reviewers that I am suspect of his motivations. He obviously doesn't know what the AT is all about. To his credit, the book is well written and he makes an honest attempt at humor but that isn't enough for me to give him a pass on his blithe treatment of the AT. If you have zero aspirations for ever seeing the AT and want o enjoy it vicariously through someone who shouldn't have been there either then this is the book for you."
5,Wonderfully Versatile,"A Walk in the Woods is a book about two novice hikers taking on the 2,000 mile Appalachian Trail. This is one of the most versatile books I've ever read. At times it reads like all of the following:- A comedy- Trail guide- A novel- A memoir- History book- Travel book- Buddy ""film""- A lamentIt seamlessly transitions between each of these genres, hilarious the whole way. I'm a big casual hiker and this book sums up very well what life is like out there on the trail. At times you may think the characters in A Walk in the Woods are far fetched and out there, but believe me I've run into crazier!"
1,Negativity Reigns!,"Bill Bryson hates everything; the South, Southerners, other hikers, the Park Service, the rain.......you get the drift. Yes, he's a very expressive writer but why he chose to write about an experience which he found so overwhelmingly negative is beyond me. There are funny parts, but DON'T read this if you're a hiker with a love of the wilderness looking to read about a similar person's experience."
1,Not an accurate discription of the Appalachian Trail!,"Yes, this book may be funny, but that's all that it is. I've thru-hiked the AT and absolutely hated this book because in NO way does it properly describe the trail, community of it, or what it is like to hike it."
3,"Mistitled, should be A History of the Woods","This is my first Bill Bryson and will undoubtably be my final. I am being generous in giving it the 3 stars. Take out all the historical drivel and the ranting against the government and this book could easily be published as a short story in some outdoor magazine. In fact thats where it belongs. The title suggest a ""rediscovering"" of America. Exactly what was rediscovered is not ever disclosed. I suggest passing on this book and read ""Walk Across America"" or ""Travels With Charley"" instead. Both are delighful reading."
3,readable but he has done better.,It is not one of Bill Bryson's best. I have a struggle to keep track with his walk in the woods and more of a struggle to find any humour. I shall be generous and say there were the odd bits that make me smile.
4,My Summer Reading,"I had to choose a summer reading book out of a list of 5 books, and I came across this one. I read the excerpt of it, and it sounded very good. Boy was I right. I absolutly love this book. Bill Bryson is an excellent author, and his book really shows what him and Katz went through. I definitly recomend this book to anyone wanting to walk the AP trail, or who just wants to read a well written novel."
3,A journey not to be trivialized,"I have rated this book 3 starts mainly for one reason. The author wanders into some lengthy detail that seemed unnecessary. While I loved the general level of detail be prepared for long side tracks on the history of trees in areas.Listening to the authors account of traveling onthe trail makes me respect thru hikers even more. Finally a book that tells it like it is. Hiking that amount of distance is not a piece of cake, there are serious things to worry about. I love that he even lets his friend (really out of shape one at that) join him on his quest. And even lets him rejoin...I enjoyed his accounts of the other hikers, what foods people crave, and the dangers of wandering off the path.A good read (especially if you are reading and can skip the side tracks) and one that should be read by all that are going to hike the AT."
4,Just funny.,"Great book. There were several parts where I thought I would pee my pants. Bill writes VERY well. If you want to do some serious hiking, this book is great for the beginner or average hiker. Plus it's just funny."
3,No Barry or Chaucer here,"""A Walk in the Woods"" is OK, but I found much of the humor off target and the natural history lite and shallow. There is no Dave Barry, Garrison Keillor, or Chaucer here for me. The book really loses focus (at least my interest) when our heros drop the AT with two-thirds of the book remaining.I saw nothing funny about a middle aged man who could not, would not, cook for himself, or make the simplest precautions for his own safety."
5,I just love this book!,"""A Walk In The Woods"" is my all time favorite book. It makes me feel like walking and walking to see what adventures I might find.A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail"
5,A walk in the woods,"A brilliantly written tale of a real hike on the Appalachian trail, this book is hilarous and moving at the same time. It makes you laugh and worry and wonder about human nature, fears, strengths and weeknesses. I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor and a love for the natural world."
2,A walk in boredom,"This book would have been one star, which for me means I abandoned it, except that it's my book club choice so I am dutifully reading it. There is a bright spot here and there - mostly due to interactions with others - but, unless you love reading about the history of the AT, you may be as bored as I am."
5,"Superb writing, simplicity at it's finest","I very much enjoyed listening to this unabridged audio CD of the book. As cluttered and complicated life is, this was refreshing, very enjoyable. It reminded me of another documented journey, this one on film, taken by Richard Proenneke, from the PBS story on his simple life spent up in Alaska.Unlike that solo journey however, Bryson's story brings to life a host of colorful characters, my favorite being ""Chicken John"", who was famous for unintentionally drifting off the Appalachian trail, and had a constant puzzled look on his face. Highly recommend this book or CD"
3,I would give 5 stars for the first half and 2 for the second.,The first half of the book is quite good. It's informative and hilarious! The second half is boring. It seems Bill had a commitment with his editor to write a 400 pages book and filled the last 200 pages with random stories on how he drove the second half of the trail.
4,A Humorous Appalacian Adventure,Well Bill decides to hike the Appalacian trail and with a wry eye and a steady or not so steady wit recounts his journey. This was a fun read with landmarks on the trail noticed and curious looks at fellow humans encountered. One scene I think of every time I think of this book. But I won't tell ya which one. Have fun!
5,A walk in the woods,Enjoyed the hard copy so much that I decided to read it again in a more convenient form on my Kindle. The people on the plane next to me as I laughed through the chapters on a long flite recently must have wondered what all the mirth was about. Love Brysons wit and his talent as a writer - he is my favourite
3,A Reverent Look at Nature,"I have read a few of Bryson's books. His humour is often irreverent, so I was surprised with the reverence he showed towards the great outdoors. He still manages to inject offbeat humour into his adventures ... I laughed out loud! His own adventures are interwoven with the history and interesting facts about the trail."
5,What a trip!,"I had bought this book as a gift for someone who enjoyed it so much I bought a copy for myself. What a gem! Other than CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES, there has been no book which made me laugh out loud, time and again. Seeking more of Bryson's keen wit, I read (available on Amazon) NOTES FROM A SMALL ISLAND, a similarly-written account of his sojourn through England. Not as laugh-out-loud funny, but a funny-bone tickler nonetheless. If you liked WALK, you'll like SMALL ISLAND."
4,Misery Is Great Company,"Bill Bryson's wit is reminiscent of J.D. Salinger's, and that's not bad company. The book almost always kept me in stitches, laughing out loud. I found his tellings of some of the tragedies of the AT a bit disturbing, especially because they were sandwiched between humorous anecdotes. On the whole, though, this is a magnum opus for all to read. It was like hiking with Holden Caulfield. A great read!"
5,Hilarious,"This book is a riot! It is also very sad, especially when he talks about the evils of the forestry management in this country, the death of the trees and the birds, and the ugliness of civilization. I couldn't put it down. I feel sorry for those humorless sourpusses who gave this book any less than the wonderful review it deserves- you missed out on some great laughs and some wonderful writing. My husband kept telling me to be quiet I was laughing so much."
3,This Book Got Off The 'Path',"Parts of this book were pretty good, but the author gets 'off the path' when he dwells in geographical and historical events such as how the AT was formed millions of years ago, etc. At that point, the book became boring."
5,A favorite,"I really enjoy reading Bill Bryson (and listening to his audio books in the car). But, alas and anon, I am from New England, and if you aren't from around here, you aren't going to get all his jokes. Its that dry sense of humor thing. Plus, the man lived in England... where the humor and whisky only get drier. The book is a tad slow in the 3rd quarter but overall I really liked this one. If there is a little bit of naturalist in you and you can laugh at yourself, you'll have a heck of a time laughing at Bill and his bud as they take on the mountain trails. Bill reminds me a bit of Peter Mayle, whose books I also heartily recommend."
3,"Starts hilarious, ends mundane...","This book had me laughing out loud in the first 30-50 pages, then, it tunred boring--like reading someone you don't know's diary. Blah, blah, blah.Where did the humor go?"
4,5 Stars for Part 1 & 3 1/2 Stars for Part 2,"There are 2 parts to this book. Part 1 is awesome! It is a great story of 2 men hiking part of the Appalachian Trail and the ups and downs they had doing it. It's funny, witty and well written. Part 2 however lags a bit. The author drives part of the trail and walk parts of it in day trips, not nearly as exciting as part 1. The only thing in my opinion that save part 2 is the history and facts the author talks about. Especially about Pennsylvania and the Delaware Water Gap. Overall I gave it 4 stars. It could have been so much better if he hiked the whole thing, but overall was still a very good read."
2,more like a documentary,"I really applaud the author form his clever writing, but this book is just not what i wanted. If you are expecting a story about hiking the AT then its not that, you will have to skip to the story parts like i did. If you want a well written history about the AT and a description of the types of plants, trees and animals then that is what you have got! I prefer the juicy details about survival in these lone areas, otherwise i would just buy a geography book."
4,Love this guy!,"Bryson is my favorite author and having read almost all of his other books and admittedly not being much of a nature lover I knew his pros would be an enthralling read! I wasn't wrong. Peppered with his usual wit and uncanny knack of finding himself in very amusing situations, it's a great read of the perils and rewards of coming out of your comfort zone."
2,Bryson is disappointing this time.,"I have read several of Bryson's books and have enjoyed them all, except this one. If i wanted to know how messed up the government is, there are plenty of other books that will tell me. I wanted this book to be about a novice's adventure on the Appalachian trail, but half of it wondered off into places I didnt want to go - at least in this book. Sorry Bryson, but you've done much better."
2,Kinda mean..,"I have to admit, some parts of this book made me giggle - Bryson's dry humor can be very funny when he isn't turning it against almost everyone he meets along the way.Maybe I'm biased (he skipped most of my home state because he just 'didn't want to be so far south' for any longer), but he spends way too much time making fun of southerners, including a complete plot outline of ""Deliverence,"" which he delivers with assurances that it could well be accurate. Geez, would you treat the natives this way if you were in a foreign country?Get this one at the library."
1,A book about the AT from someone who didn't really hike it?,"I picked this book up based on library review site as a ""Librarian Recommended"" and boy, what a disappointment. I have read several other accounts of AT hikes and this one was the worst. If Bryson had anything positive to say it was lost between the complaining about everyone he met along the way, the ""politics"" of the agencies/people involved with the trail, and/or scaring the pants off of people who have never hiked the trail with bear maulings/massacres by people/lightening strikes. And, given the fact that the author barely hiked any of the trail to begin with was never mentioned on the front/inside cover. He skipped beginning parts of the trail because he had nothing but derogatory things to say about anyone from the south and was disappointed in the price of a cheeseburger. There are plenty of other wonderful accounts of the AT - skip this one!"
5,Fantastic and highly entertaining commentary!,"This book is hilarious and educational at the same time. Bryson is very adept at weaving a truely heartfelt tale of his days on the trail while also taking time to educate readers on the history of this country and its natural resources. It is evident that Bryson feels very strongly about some of the pressures facing the natural resources of this country, but he does not preach. The intuitive and descriptive prose used to illustrate the various characters he meets during his travels is wonderful.This book makes you want to quit your job, grab a pack, and hit the trail. My copy will be dog-eared and battered. The most satisfying read I've had in weeks."
5,so funny,"This book not only walks you through the woods but takes you on a funny adventure through the Appalachian Trail and everyone they meet on the way. It is full of interesting facts about the trail and wildlife. It kept me laughing with the two of them and helped me invision what it would look and be like out there on the trail. Its definately one of my favs. I own both the Kindle version and audiobook version. I recommend the audiobook version as well, it is even more entertaining to hear him tell you the story."
4,Entertaining,Great book. Author surprised me with his intelligent and creative flow leaving it hard to put down. Very detailed and leaves you with a sense of what to truly expect while attempting this thru-hike.
1,"A ""Ride"" in the Woods","If you like ""hiking"" stories with a lot of car renting, hitchhiking and cab riding, this one is for you. This guy is supposed to be hiking, but for some reason, he just can't stay out of automobiles. I would have enjoyed an audio book about serious hiking, or a self-effacing book about humorous hiking misadventures, but this guy actually considers himself an accomplished hiker, even after quitting the trail. And it's all delivered in a condescending tone toward Southerners, the poor, The Forest Service, the Park Service the Boy Scouts and anyone else he doesn't care for. This book is supposed to be funny, and it is. Sadly, I was laughing AT the author, not with him. I can just picture this LL Bean wearing latte sipper and his fat buddy, stumbling through the woods with little notebooks, making enough noise to wake the dead, all the while keeping a keen eye out for a Holiday Inn Express. I highly recommend skipping this."
1,Very disappointing,This is a very disappointing book I couldn't even finish it. I was hoping it might be an iformative book for someone thinking about thru hiking the AT but instead its about an out of shape fat ass who gives up at the very beginning and knows a lot about the history of the AT. Please don't buy this book. Bryson needs to quit his job as an author and think about maybe flipping burgers I think it would be a better suited job.
1,If you love the Trail skip this book...,"Back packers are an interesting lot. Through hikers on the AT come from diverse backgrounds and range from college students to retired postal workers to returning vets. They are, however, connected by a common bond: a love of hiking and the hope of self-discovery. Bryson undertook his hike with the stated purpose of writing this book. He chose an over weight, out of shape, obnoxious ex-college chum as his trail mate. His purpose was not to discover the trail or himself or the simple joy of wilderness but simply to write a book. His book may well be a financial success but his vision of the trail is one the reader might expect from a commodities broker and not one who hikes because of some higher purpose. There are easier ways to gather material and better books on the trail than this. The real surprise is that the AT Conference puts this book in their catalogue."
4,"Great book, but first half is better","I really enjoyed this book. But like others, I thought the first half was fantastic, the second half not quite as good.It begins with all narrative, which is easily to follow and usually funny. Then Bryson begins to interject environmental lectures, which sound though they may be are hardly as entertaining as the narrative. Then the hiking narrative itself became less interesting. He began just doing day hikes from parking lots and while he explains (and I understand) his reasoning for doing so, it simply just isn't quite as entertaining to read about.Overall, it's a great book and well worth reading. But I do think Bryson could have put a little more effort into the second half."
4,A walk in the woods...,"First off, it would be a mistake to view this as a travel guide to the AT. It isn't. It's a middle-aged elitist(that's okay, I'm an elitist too) who decides to try something grand and fails to make it. Obviously hiking the AT isn't for everyone, and I would keep that in mind before throwing the book away in disgust after realizing that Bryson ""merely"" hiked 800 miles.Reading some of the other reviews I wonder if we read the same book. Rather than taking his cracks at Southerners for what they are(a Yankee perception on anyone South of the Mason-Dixon) they choose to take them seriously and ignore the friendly folks they meet along the way. Another strange complaint is the profanity. It's on the order of something that you see in, say, The Simpsons, and the F-bomb is dropped only once(while his hiking partner is truggling with substance abuse, so context matters kids). In other words, it isn't much. Of course, I was in the Navy so I may have a higher threshold"
4,Now this is a cool job...,"What a cool job... do what you want to do (hike the AT) and then get paid to write a book about it! I'm way jealous. Great story and information about the Appalachian Trail. Funny characters and situations. Gets a little soap-boxy at times, but still a good read."
3,Great potential...but falls flat,"This book had moments of true hilarity, but unfortunately didn't maintain any one tone. The first 50 pages or so are especially funny, but throughout the story, Bryson's preachy monologues about conservation intrude every time on the moments that his story almost takes off; he can't seem to stick to any one subject or thread, and as a result, none is fleshed out. And the book petered out limply, leaving me wondering what really motivated him to make the trip (totally unprepared and ignorant of the upcoming trek, honestly it was dumb luck that he lived to write about it at all), what he got out of it, and certainly why he wrote the book."
2,A disappointment,"If you are looking to be inspired by someone who thru hiked the Appalachian trail then dont read this book. If you want inspiration by someone who actually accomplished something amazing then read something by Dean Karnazes or by someone who actually thru hiked it. Bryson quit a fraction a the way through. Then hiked bits and pieces of it with his car and lunches packed by his wife the day before.Plus he criticizes nearly every other hiker on the trail including his out of shape, poorly chosen hiking partner. He also criticizes nearly every organization on the way from the Forest Service to the Army Corp of Engineers.Bits and pieces of the book were funny. I actually like Bryson's works but this book was a huge let down.So if you want to know what its like to thru hike the AT then this is NOT the book to read.Disappointing"
1,this book is a joke,"Although a very descriptive book, Bryson acts as though he knows all there is to know about the AT. Bryson showed that he did know one thing, and that was how to quit."
2,"A bad, bad read","I picked up this book at the library because I heard it was good. I did finish the whole book but do not understand why anyone would want to waste their time and money reading about a quitter. It must have been nice to hike the AT, quit, and still make a ton of money. The book is only mildly funny and if you want to read a book about a real pilgrimage about finding ones self you should read WALKING HOME by KELLY WINTERS."
3,Good read but it could have been better.,I originally thought this would be a story about a thru hike of the Appalachian Trail. It isn't. They don't even finish the last segment they attempted. Why anyone would go on a life changing adventure with a guy like Katz is puzzleing to say the least. It is an interesting book for what there is of it. Could have been a lot better.
3,Not to Expectations,"An amusing book about two non-hikers walking the Appalachian Trail. This book contains many good sections dealing with the history of the Trail, its geology, ecology, famous hikers and folklore. These are the high points, and its quite good. The author makes one realize the beauty we have missed from the effects of acid rain, the decimation of the Elm and Chestnut trees to disease and the loss of the virgin forest in general. The problem with the story is that it dwells the majority of the time on the inane and tedious conversation of two hikers. Another disappointment with this book is that they sampled the Appalachian Trail and did not actually hike the whole trail. I thought I was going to read about the tenacity and mental toughness it would take to tackle the whole Trail. All in all, it was a worthwhile read for some of the knowledge gained, but it must be gleaned from the passages in between the conversational sections."
4,"A funny, entertaining read","Bill Bryson's book is a quick, entertaining read that starts off with page after page of laugh-out-loud material. The book drags in the 70 or so pages that Bryson's friend Katz goes back home. And while the book picks up steam for the home strech, it never regains its comic voice. I also got the sense he finished his hiking in the trail merely for finishing his obligation for the book (to give back a book advance is far harder than walking the AT). No matter. I recommend the book."
2,Disappointed,"I had to get this book for a class. It was highly recomended by everyone that I talked to that had read it, including my teacher, so I was exided to read it. Now that i have completed the book i only have one thing to say, Over rated. The beginning was enjoyable, but after that... Boring."
3,A pleasant read if you can wade through the smug,"I enjoy Mr. Bryson's craft of writing. His description of the trail, and his attempt at walking it capture the imagination. Never mind that he doesn't finish the trail; it's his story of his attempt. The descriptions are vivid. It's an inspirational read, and reignites my love of hiking and makes me want to attempt a long, put-off goal of x-country skiing a hut trip! My complaint is his constant snide remarks about his walking partner, others on the trail, the towns he visits, the simpletons who inhabit the towns,and government agencies who oversee the trails and make decisions for towns. It gets old and sounds a bit whiney and snide after awhile."
5,Bryson's walk in the woods is fall down funny.,"Just as Bryson stopped and started his long trek in the woods, I tried to read this book in tiny bites just to make the fun last longer.In taxis and on airplanes, I scared people laughing out loud at his bullet-to-the-heart hysterically funny observations about turning 50, the humiliation of a beginner buying unfamiliar equipment and the wonderfully zany real characters living in the outermost boonies in America.It's a wet your pants funny book."
3,A wlk in the Woods : american Style,"Bill Bryson is a US citizen that has lived too long in England. For a Brit who knows BB's style , unlike his other books, this book is not a laugh a paragraph. But when you read about the awesome distance of the AT as well as the amazing lack of interest the US has for its wonderful countryside you realize that it isn't so funny. The only country that doesn't understand global warming is responsible for 50% of it. !!! Few US citizens would find anything humourous about his social comment about his own country. Not for the 99% parochial US reader. But as the saying goes ' A poet in his own country......'"
4,Laughed out loud!,"Like many other reviewers, I laughed out loud while reading this book on planes and in other public places! My favorite thing about this book is that Bryson does not take himself too seriously. While I have loved many other outdoor books about more serious mountaineering trips (like ""Into Thin Air""), this one was enjoyable because it was so much closer to my backpacking experiences - I could relate to it much more.I recognized many of the characters in his book - his companion Katz is not unlike one of my own sometimes hiking companions. The stories of shopping for the gear and packing it nearly made me cry! He also captures what it's like to be out there for days on the trail - grubby, tired, and seeing somewhat the same thing day after day. He is just captivated by the vastness of it all, like so many of us."
5,"Hilarious, informative, and superbly written.","I absolutely love ""A Walk in the Woods""; I have read it several times, and it always puts a smile on my face. Bill Bryson seamlessly mixes travel narrative, humor, history, harrowing outdoor stories, and educational information together to make a book that is endlessly interesting and completely hilarious. Some negative reviews for this book are based on the fact that Bryson did not complete the entire AT. Thus, if you are one of those people who take themselves and life so seriously that not finishing a 2,000 mile trail is considered a failure and a fatal character flaw, then this book is not for you. However, if you like to laugh and learn while a masterful writer takes you on a lighthearted attempt at long distance hiking, then you will love this book."
4,Great humor,"I found myself laughing out loud, which is when I know I'm reading great humor. Bryson throws in a good mix of history along with this tale, which I also liked. His buddy on the trail, Katz, was a great character and I enjoyed this book the most when he was along for the ride. Short, easy read that made me want to spend more time outdoors. Looking forward to reading more of this authors work. Yeah, he's smug and judgemental, but come on folks, it's just a story..."
5,Bryson takes on the Appalacian Trail and America's Love of Nature,"Bryson chronicles his trek along the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine with his characteristic combination of engaging historical, naturalistic, and cultural poignancy and his hilarious anecdotes. Bryson perfectly captures the beauty and power of nature, and humanity's confused, affectionate, yet destructive love affair with it. He also perfectly captures the triumphs, pains, and indescribable need of hiking. Brilliant book, though Bryson does tend to contradict himself (scolding the AT for being too much protected wilderness and also being not enough). Addicting, brilliant read. Grade: A"
2,Couldn't finish reading it..,"This book started out really well, very funny and you settle in for an exciting adventure... THEN, the adventure ends halfway through the book and it becomes a text book teaching you about salamanders, many species of plants, song birds, warblers, and never ending history of....""stuff"".. Not to mention they give up and the author decides to drive the rest of the trail, not even making it to Katahdin..How can you live in New Hampshire and not even make a DAY TRIP to Katahdin?? Really?What a let down..I advise, if you have to buy this book, do it on Amazon for 7 bucks and don't make the mistake of paying $15.99 at Barnes and Noble like I did.. What a waste.. Never finished the book."
3,He shoulda stayed home,"Most of us who read a book like this would love to have the opportunity to get paid (and very well) to hike the AT and write about our experience. For Bryson it was clearly just a job and an unpleasant one at that. Generally very readable (his ""A Short History of Everything' is very good), Bryson just slogs through this. Grumpy, cynical, and sarcastic with almost every step, it is a curmudgeon's tale of woe on the trail. From that standpoint it is unique and worth reading. But he's such a morose toad that by the end one is almost glad he was so miserable."
3,O,"I thought it was going to be more about the actual hiking of the Appalachian trail. His descriptions of the areas were good. The book was a little slow for me. I enjoyed Wild a lot better, about a woman the hikes part of the Pacific Coast Trail."
5,An excellent read,"Few books, or any medium for that matter, have the ability to make me laugh out loud and often. This book, an excellent story, is wrapped in humor and razor sharp wit. Buy it now. Buy it for a friend.ONE WARNING: Be prepared to undure the quizical stares of the people you live with as the look at you and wonder why you are laughing like an idiot."
3,"OK book, clean up the language",Sorry but I found his use of four letter words tiresome and less than funny. Clean it up and it would have been much more enjoyable.
4,A good read,"People either love Bill Bryson or they hate him. Seems to me, after reading this slew of reviews, that if you take yourself (or your pursuits, like hiking) too seriously, you're not going to appreciate Bryson. Although it suffers a bit in the middle, when, after having given up on thru-hiking, Bryson attempts a series of uninspired and uninspiring day hikes, the bulk of this book is solidly funny as it makes some serious points. As to complaints that readers were somehow misled into thinking he hiked the whole thing--where on Earth did you get that idea? Nowhere on the cover copy (or in any review I've read) does such a claim appear. At any rate, I heartily recommend Bryson's work, and you can take that from a gal that grew up in Waynesboro, VA--the town with no sidewalks. As a matter of fact, Waynesboro DOES have sidewalks, plenty of them. They just don't lead out of town to the K-mart. I love Bill, anyway!"
2,Arrogance shines,Ok the first part is funny. But my god he is forever putting down other hikers and the locales. Then once he leaves the trail he becomes insufferable. Some parts of the trail aren't really worthwhile (my god why bother with Pennsylvania ). And then for some reason his day hikes become some real adventure.His putting down of other hikers is ridiculous and the put down of technology is laughable.I truly think th author did something which was admirable ( hiking 10%) of the trail and then got a very overblown sense of his achievement.Btw- before you attack me as a wannabe I did hike thebPacific Crest Trail in 98-99.
2,Allmost fooled me,"This is a very entertaining and fun to read story until the half way point. If you want to read a book about hiking the appalachian trail, find one written by someone who didn't quit halfway through."
3,There are no bears in this book!,"Don't be fooled by the bear peeking out from the bottom of the cover of this book, like I was, and think you're going to read about an adventurous bear encounter somewhere in this book. You never will! There are no bloody bears in this book! I found the book to be a fairly enjoyable read, but not really what I had hoped for (maybe something more action packed). I also thought it kind of lost steam in the second half and had somewhat of a let down of an ending. Plus, there was some harsh language I wasn't expecting. It wasn't a waste of time to read, but it wasn't the most satisfying experience.Most of all, I was mournful of the lack of a bear. Just look at the cover and make up a story in your head when you get to feeling that way.Edit: For all of the people who are dissing this review, you KNOW you wanted to see a bear in the novel too!"
1,Not a book to buy! Waste of money!,I ordered this book in anticipation of reading valuable insights of someone who enjoyed the AT. I've done quite a bit of hiking all over the country and was thinking of trekking the AT since I'm now retired and able to have the time. But this little piece seemed to be written by someone who continually dribbles on with anything on his mind and only occasionally mentioned something regarding adventure on the famed footpath.He starts off with a theme on the dangers of being attacked by wildlife ad nauseum. Then starts into vulgarity at being scared $hitless and continues in this vein that makes me want to cringe with embarrassment for actually reading it.I like to read a lot and I've read plenty of mostly good and sometimes bad books. But this was the first time I felt the strong urge to write a review to possibly prevent another reader from making the same mistake I did in buying this trash.
3,OK but a bit cynical and preachy,"I have a love/hate relationship with the Bryson books that I have read. I enjoy the history, information and humor but I grow tired of the negativity and cynical view he seems to have for everyone that doesn't seem to fit into his view of ""propper"".Not being familiar with the area of the Appalachian Trail, I enjoyed hearing about the trail and its history. I also enjoyed hearing about the history of some of the locations along the trail. The humor is also good - to a point!! Eventually I grew tired of the negative attitude towards most things. He is also needlessly hard on many of the well-intentioned people who provide, maps, information and maintenance on the trail.One more thing: His view of our National Forests, and most people who manage, uses or make there living from them is, at best, uniformed (coming from somebody who lives surrounded by national forests)."
5,Some Kind of Funny Pleasant,"What I truly admired about Bill's walk in the woods, was not having to rationalize any gratuitous strife or hardships to appreciate this account. In other words, Bill made this walk fun, educational, and I must add, full of expectations that (graciously) never happened.As many have pointed out, the beginning, and spots here and there throughout, are absolutely laugh out loud hilarious. There's also a peppering of other hiking accounts, (such as Brenner's account), that adds the realism element to what the near 900-mile walk (just rounding things off), fortunately for Bill & Katz lacked. Add this factor onto the massively impressive historical references to forests, geology, and geography, and it just about sums up the walk.Quite a relaxing read."
2,Disappointed,"I had high expectations about this book. My friend said he was laughing out loud all through the book. I never had that experience. I found the first half to be entertaining. Just as I was tiring of the story halfway through, (almost dreading reading it as they were of their hike)Bill and his friend decide to quick the AT. What a disappointment! Instead of reading the rest, I skipped to end, but by that time, I had lost all interest in the story. I, too, was waiting for a great bear story, but it never materialized. I agree with several reviewers that Bill is quite full of himself, but what I found odd from this man who enjoyed the outdoors, and was saddened by the environmental damage being done to our forests, is that he and his friend smoked while on the trail. I decided, right there, this man is full of it."
1,NOT a book for REAL backpackers,"This is absolutely the most ignorant book I have ever read. Not only does this fellow have no idea what he is doing on the trail but he has no apparent respect for it either. Anyone who is interested in the AT or backpacking in general should Stay Away as this book gives the reader NO concept of the true experience of backpacking. I am almost embarassed to admit I read this book. Above all else, I was crushed by the disappointing ending to the book and his travels. My advice? Don't waste your time if your are genuinely interested in wilderness or travel writing. Try some Abbey."
4,Great Start - Great Ending,"I must admit, I read this book in under 10 hours because it was so good. BUT, the middle section was a bit 'slow' (to say the least). In my opinion, too much history, not enough hiking. But WELL worth reading!"
4,Laughed out loud on the plane,"Which is pretty embarassing. This book is about how everything -- pathos, humor, love, respect, trees -- is involved in something as simple as a walk outdoors. And it's a hoot.Take this book for what it is. To all the through-hikers appalled by this book, Bryson never claimed to be the Appalachian Krakauer. Though maybe he is. Both write simply and well about our curiosity to discover, and our capacity to redefine, our own limits. I just imagine that Bryson has more stomach (and legs) for the discovery than the redefinition. In other words, don't expect ""A Stroll in the Snow"" followup (though lightening up the Everest literature wouldn't hurt, either)."
3,Yes and No,"Without a doubt Bill Bryson is a good writer. I've read other books of his and enjoyed them very much. ""A Walk In The Woods"" is hilarious and informative in many respects. However anyone who has done any degree of hiking and/or backpacking will find much to poo poo about this book.In the vein of Dave Barry his anecdotes are great but as a factual account of his ""adventure"" there is a lot to question.It is obvious the author's intent is to make a good yarn and this he achieves. To take the account as indicative of actual hiking experience is a leap of faith.There is much historical data and descriptive material but ""Steve"" is a figment of the authors imagination, fortunately, for no one should ever be put through the rigors Steve, in his corpulent condition and lack of conditioning, is forced to endure.A fun book to be taken with several grains of salt."
5,contributer,Hillarious. Great adventure and full of off the wall facts. Makes you want to go for a hike.
3,Lighten Up People!,"This book has some extremely funny laugh-out-loud parts. It is NOT meant to be a technical hiking book for crying out loud! So what if he doesn't complete the trail? Should that prevent him from having a sense of humour? There seem to be those who find his sharp looks at the people of a certain area too critical. I say again: lighten up! The first Bryson book I read was ""Notes from a Small Island"" in which he casts his critical (but loving) eye at the British people, and as a Brit I can say it was all pretty much spot on, and damned funny to boot. The reason I gave the book only three stars is because it does drag on a little, especially when Katz is not there to buffer Bryson's angst. Nevertheless, worth a read. Keep 'em coming Bryson."
1,"contrived journey, mean-spirited reportage.","As an AT thru-hiker, I have about a thousand problems with this book -- the least of which is that Bryson didn't hike the trail. (He hiked the first 300 or so miles, decided it was too tough, and then drove around the rest, occasionally getting back on to do bits and pieces here and there.)"
5,A Great Book,"This was a very enjoyable book. I would also recommend ""In a Sunburned Country"" by the same author."
4,"Good listen, dissapointing, informative, funny","I like this book. I like that it is read by the author. I don't like how it all turns out. I love all the facts and information. All very useful for any hiker. Also, environmentally conscious, very nice."
3,Witty yet wordy,"Like some other reviewers, I felt that the first half of this book is wonderful....then, as soon as Bryson quits the trail, it seems as if he quits the book. When off the trail, the book becomes more of a quasi-scientific/ecological/historical mish mash of drolling babble....and if you buy the hardback, please tear out pages 171-172 before you get started. The obvious inacuracies there spoiled my entire AT experience with Bryson and Katz."
4,Bill Bryson always makes me laugh,I love Bill Bryson's work. He always makes me laugh. The fact that I have lived close to the Appalachian Trail only made it better. I have to say I liked Notes From a Small Island better but this one is pretty good. He does get alittle preachy on environmental topics but the laughs make that worthwhile.
3,"entertaining, preachy, and true","Having done a little day-hiking on the AT in New England. and knowing those who have hiked much more, I really enjoyed the first half of the book. Unfortunately for the reader, after Bryson and pal leave the trail, the book goes down hill. Worth borrowing from a friend. If you're contemplating through-hiking the AT, definitely worth reading."
3,2/3rds of this booka re funny,"i picked this up cause I was in the mood for a funny read. This book is funny - for about 2/3rds of it. The rest of the book is padded with lots of data about national parks. If I had known it would be so scholarly on that front, I probably would have skipped it alltogether. The first 2/3rds is really funny though."
4,Great First Half,"Bryson should have ended this book after he and Katz finished their hike. In the first half of the book Bryson describes how he prepared for his adventure, and how an old friend, Katz decided to join him. The two were an unlikely hiking duo, which made the story even funnier. Bryson humorously describes the people and the wildlife they met on the trail.Though the trip ended halfway through the book, Byrson continued writing about AT history and the day trips he took alone. He missed Katz...and so did I. The humor and excitement ended with Katz's exit. Only in the last few pages did Katz return, and the two briefly revisited the AT. I would have preferred it if Bryson had expanded the first half of his book and left the second half on the cutting room floor."
2,"""It isn't what I expected.""","Bill Bryson has a comedic gift and adds just the right amount of embellishment to make the story fun and compelling, in the beginning. But, when he gave up on hiking the trail, the tone changed in the book, and I gave up on wanting to read it. It could have been so much more, but the fact is, it isn't. Left me sorely disappointed and the ironic part is ""It isn't what I expected."""
5,absolutely entertaining and informative-Highly recommended,"This was my first experience with a taped book and it has made me a convert! I shared it with two other newcomers who also loved it. Witty, informative, descriptive, the author captures the realities and allure of hiking and of the fun and foibles of sharing such a time with a friend. He also weaves in interesting stories about the history of the various Parks and the Trail. I loved his command of the language and went on to read and enjoy ""Notes from a Small Island""."
4,"A never ending supply of surprises, on and of the trail","Bryson does an excellant task of entertaining the reader while sneaking in a never-ending supply of facts and anecdotes about the appalacian trail, those who surround it, and those who have attempted to conquer it. Bill's own experience is delightfully told, his true love for the outdoors comes through in every page. His writing fluctuates to reflect his own emotional state as progresses the trail and even leaves it for a period, only to inevitably return. I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever hit the trails anywhere in the world!"
5,Bryson does it again!,"I have read Bryson books for years. I love his point of view! This is his best book yet! The Trail was such a great subject for him to base his book on. All I did was laugh, except for the bear and murder sections. I want to walk the trail now! Even when he was having a terrible time, the book was still funny. It was also wonderful that he was accompanied by his childhood friend Steven Katz. I hope that the go on more adventures togeather!"
4,Hilarious,I laughed out load more times than I can count. I even laughed uncontrollably until I cried at one point in the book. I could picture all the people and places as easily as if I were there with him. This is a great book!
4,A Walk in the Woods-a good book,"In ""A Walk in the Woods"", Bill Bryson took me on the Appalachian Trail himself. He made me feel like I was walking along with him and Katz. He put the book together so well. It was funny, adventurous, and informational. I learned so much that I could not get out of an ordinary textbook. Even though this book is basically for adults, children would like it too. Bryson took a story that could be boring and bland and turned it into a great adventure. He made me want to take the trail myself. It seemed like it changed Bryson and especially Katz's life forever. They got through something that they didn't think they could get through at the beginning of the trip. Bill Bryson could be a true role model."
3,Good for few laughs,"Although the characters in this book made me laugh out loud the story lacked something. He didn't finish the thru hike. He has way to many tangents (polical, historical, evolution, etc).It just seemed to me that the guy walked the trail to have a book to write."
5,Enjoy life more,"Having been on several excursions, both hiking and in cars, I can truly say that this book captures the essence of the journey. The people who are critical need to realize that this book is neither a survival guide or an itenerary of hiking the AT. It is a great story that goes deeper than just the physical pursuit of completing the trail. Sit back, enjoy it and realize that part of an adventure is what happens when your plans veer off the beaten path."
3,"Disappointing Story, Yet Entertaining at Times","At the beginning of the book Bryson gives the impression that he did, indeed, hike the entire AT. After 100 pages, though, you realize that this is not the case. I found this ""false advertising"" to be incredibly frustrating.At times, the ""save the planet"" motif gets a little thick -- I found myself wondering where I managed to lose Bryson & Katz in the plot. For all of his preaching, the duo are *not* low-impact campers. At one point, Katz ""tosses an empty pop can into the undergrowth"" before going to bed.Bryson, however, is rather entertaining and I laughed out loud during one or two funny sequences.I would not recommend this book to friends without first warning them that he doesn't even hike half the AT."
4,A fun read and hard to put it down,"I am an avid backpacker and have been so for over 40 years. It is obvious from the beginning that he wasn't going to be able to thru hike the AT but I could certainly relate to much of what he wrote about. As to those in the previous reviews who put the book down because they were offended or overly self righteous, I would say, get a life. This book was written for those of us who can laugh at ourselves. Any who doubt that the Forest Service isn't clearcutting the land to the detriment of the environment and the best interests of the outdoor citizen should spend some time in the state of Washington. 'enough said. I loved the book, it took my mind off the foolishness going on in Washington D.C. Thanks Bryson."
3,A funny yet flawed account of the hiking experience,"This was an easy, page turning book by a very witty and informed writer. Yet, as a hiker, I felt that Bryson is in the early stages of maturation as a hiker himself. He did not seem to ever get the sense of tranquility and simple joy of living that comes from hiking. He seemed to be too stuck in the competitiveness of ""how many miles"" rather than enjoying the beauty and wonder that all that hiking brings. He seems to make a lot of rookie mistakes too like not having his waterproof gear with him in one case. And he never even saw a bear! I think that Bill should come hiking out west on the Pacific Crest Trail. He could fashion a journey of a week or so covering 50 miles and he would have more fun and see more beauty than he seems to have found on the Appalachian Trail over 870 miles. Plus, what the heck, he should have bought Katz the beer."
4,Bryson and Katz provide great entertainment,"A light hearted enjoyable read from beginning to end. If you're a modest outdoorsperson, you'll really relate to the author."
2,A whiner's guide to the Appalachian Trail!,"Like a hiker on the trail itself, the author starts out energetically, but about 100 pages into the book, he begins to tire and gets cranky. The longer the book goes on, the crankier and more arrogant he becomes. Everybody else is stupid, except him. His constant denigration of his hiking partner leads me to the conclusion that I'd rather hike with the partner, than with the author. And he parrots all the politically correct notions of the eco-elitists. All that said,however, the book DOES give some good practical insight about hiking on the trail, if you're planning such a hike. But otherwise, this snob's graceless bitching and sniffing made my head ache. The AT deserves a much better book."
2,A good half book,"I can deal with the fact that Bryson did not walk the entire Trail. This does not mean it should be a bad book. In fact, the most humerous parts of the book are those with his friend, Stephen Katz. However, half way into the book, the narrative turns into a grandstand for Bryson to unload all his problems with Americans and the Environment. When this happens, just turn the pages to where he picks up the Trail with Katz. Another unappealing aspect: Bryson has a very ""The National Park Service is Stupid"" stance, which is unfair and rather boorish. Leave the Park Service alone; they have a very large, important job to do with very little bugetary support. Where was the editor when these diatributes against the Park Service (which run for pages) were printed?"
2,He didn't hike the AT!!!,"The first half of the book was very good. Even a little witty. However, he quit hiking! You don't write about hiking the AT when you haven't done it. I haven't done it either but, I'm not writing a book about it. There are many other good books about the AT,, take a PASS on this one."
2,Interesting subject but irritatingly smug and sarcastic,"The subject is interesting, the descriptions are evocative and many of the observations are apt. I happen to share a lot of his views on the shortcomings of the Forest Service and the Park Service. But I quickly tired of the curmudgeonly, petulant, sarcastic tone and the impression Bryson gives of himself as the only intelligent and sane person surrounded by a sea of inanity and incompetence. The few pleasant, friendly people he meets are dismissed with a few words, while the majority with which he finds fault are heaped with scorn at length. It was made even worse by the fact that I chose the ""Talking Book"" version, which is read by Bryson himself. He is clearly enamored of his own wit, laying the sarcasm on thick in his delivery just in case the dull reader might miss it otherwise. I finally got sick of it and didn't finish the book."
3,Katz makes the book.,"As reported by many ""A Walk in the Woods"" is a laugh-out-loud book. If one is looking for a how-to book on the AT, this is not it. If anything, it's a how-not-to book on the AT. The author, Bryson, and his less-than-trusty companion, Katz, represent anyone who has painfully longed to do something which one is completely and utterly unprepared and unqualified to do. With all due respect to Bryson, whose idea it was to hit the trail, Katz is the funniest and most interesting character. Without him, the book would have been (and is between the pages of 163 and 235) substantially less entertaining. The reader labors through Chapters 13 to 19 without Katz. The book picks up again in Chapter 19 when Katz returns to the trail with Bryson but by that time the momentum of the first 163 pages was lost and the book never really regained its humorous and interesting form."
4,Very Entertaining,Bryson's stories of his trip up the Appalachian trail were amusing and brought a smile to my face as I read. His story made me want to grab a backpack and head out for a day-hike. I also found the background information on the history of the trail very interesting. This is a must-read for anyone interested in taking on the trail.
2,There's a Much Better Book Available People,"This book was written by an author who wanted to sell books. Dennis Blanchard's ""Three Hundred Zeroes"" is about five times better and is an honest, amusing account of the Appalachian Trail. Plus, it's a whole book, not a short read with Bryson's long teaser about his next work at the 75% point. Arrgh. Skip this and buy the Blanchard book. It's full of usable info from an older guy who actually hiked the whole trail, didn't skip in and out, and faced some serious challenges along the way."
3,Enjoyable,"I learned a lot about the A.T. as Bryson calls it. And I loved Katz. Bryson is a bit boring by himself. When he wrote ""I missed Katz"", I replied to myself, ""Yeah, me too."" It was well-written. But I guess in the end it just fell flat for me since they cut so much out of the trail, he took daytrip hikes, and they fell short of Mt. Katahdin. I wanted a bit more about how they managed the wilderness than I got. But hey, I will read more Bryson. Some parts were LOL funny, and I did learn a lot all the while."
3,Not what I thought,"This is a travel narrative. It will not provide you any useful information about hiking the AT, or hiking in general.The worst part, and far from necessary, was the repeated negative, stereotypical comments about the South and those who live there. Is it really necessary to reference the movie Deliverance just because you're hiking in Georgia. The generalizeations and prejudices became offensive."
2,Audio review,"I listened to the audio tape (abridged version) read by the author. It was recommended as something that was very funny. However, while humerous in some spots, I though the book was wordy, the author whiney, and overall dull. While it passed the time away while I was driving, I could not imagine sitting at home and listening to it."
2,It would have been better as a short story,"I am very happy that I checked this book out from the library instead of buying it because it is really only half a book.The book starts out well, but it takes a bad turn when they quit hiking the trail. The book should have ended there, but instead drags on and on. I stopped reading when Bill begins to drive back to the trail for day hikes, so if the book gets better after that, I will never know."
3,"Hilarious, but pedantic in parts","In this book Bill Bryson is at his best when he describes the comic adventures which he and his buddy Stephen Katz experienced while hiking the Appalachian Trail. Unfit and woefully unprepared, the two men set out on a 2,000 mile adventure. Creature comforts become real luxuries as they slog along the trail fighting heat, cold, insects, muscle camps, and blisters. There are a few instances of real or imagined danger, but mostly they are two city boys who find out what the woods are really all about. The book bogs down a bit as Bryson lectures about the geology, flora and fauna of the areas he's traversing, and his carping on environmental issues becomes downright tedious at times. This book is definitely at its best when Bryson gives his wry view of his personal hiking experience, especially when in the company of the intrepid Katz who is his perfect comic foil."
2,50-50,"It appears that after masterfully completing the first half of the story, his editor told him to wrap it up. Wait for a 50% off sale or split the price with a friend and you'll get your money's worth."
4,"Very entertaining, yet poignant & informative as well","I loved this book. Bryson is a humorist, and a good one, but I was struck by his awareness and respect concerning the American wilderness. Funny or no, this book doubles as a plea to all Americans to REALIZE what we have, to APPRECIATE it, and to respect and conserve it. We live in a lovely country, and Bryson realizes that it's up to us to keep it as such. Right on, Bill Bryson!!"
4,Good but not his best...,"I really enjoyed this book. I love Bryson's whit, and view on life generally. I also like the little snippets of history he always weaves into the narrative. His love of the landscape and his dislike for the National Parks Service are both funny and touching. Going along with his old friend Katz was inspired!As is usually the case, the first two thirds of the book move along at a good pace, the last third seems to drag a little.If you're new to Bryson this is good, but look at ""Lost Continent"" or ""Neither Here Nor There"" for his best stuff travel stuff. His histories of language are also excellent!"
4,A Walk in the Woods,"Bill Bryson makes it clear that hiking the Appalachian Trail is brutal and tough. He leaves it with mixed feelings: ""I was weary of the trail, but still strangely in its thrall; found the endless slog tedious but irresistible; grew tired of the boundless woods but admired their boundlessness; enjoyed the escape from civilization and ached for its comforts."" Now I am not tough, not at all. And yet I found myself texting a friend ""Want to hike the Appalachian Trail?""...I wrote more at my blog: [...]"
5,Fantastic,I had never heard of Bryson before and this was the best possible introduction. Just a pleasure to read and reread.
1,This book was a HUGE disappointment!!,I read through this book with a light heart. It was nice in that it took it lightly and can make anyone believe they can hike. HOWEVER - after having read through it - I was annoyed to find that these 2 didn't even complete the trail. I have done sections and my biggest triumph was getting to the top of Katahdin. They did not. I was waiting to hear how they did it and what they thought of it. It seems they just decided one day to stop hiking and walk out. That was not what I read on and on to get to at the end!!!
1,Bryson has had his nose stuffed up English ass for years.,"Will take far fewer than 1000 words to review Bryson. Or maybe not. It is telling that this Anglophilic ""arse"" sniffer is on the best-seller lists in the UK. He loves all that is Brit <witness his constant use of Briticisms when writing for an American audience - undoubtedly a smaller one than in the UK> and his exaggerated and hopelessly phony sounding renditions of encounters with his fellow Americans <he cringes at this>. Beehive hair-do's and cat-eye glasses - such is what this hapless Europhile endured, allegedly, all the while fatuously catering to the Islanders who have thus far so awarded him their readership. Theroux is honest. Jan Morris is honest. This fawning sycophant chucklehead is the biggest fraud since Milli Vanilli....only comparison I could think of. Is one star as low as I can go?"
4,Unique Story Telling,"This is a good book on many different levels. Bryson is a great humorist, but he also tells a poignant story of redemption."
5,A must for anyone who hikes,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. if you hike, camp or backpack and have a sense of humor, this is the book for you."
5,"If you get dragged on hikes by spouses, read this book!","My husband is an avid hiker. I merely follow along, often unwillingly. Don't get me wrong, I love the outdoors, but when he insists on dragging a deaf woman with no sense of balance on a night hike to a particular spot, which turns out to be a swamp...well,I understand how Bill Bryson felt in many circumstances. This was an absolutely hilarious read. I commiserated with him deeply even though he let himself in for it (don't we all at some point?). I've been on the Appalachian Trail myself and recognize some of the spots he talks about. I also recognize the people you meet, and how often people are very nice and patient when outdoors. This is an extremely good summer read. Take it with you the next time your spouse drags you into an uncomfortable situation! Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh"
5,Hilarious and fun to read!,"I heard someone mention a book by Bill Bryson. Curious, I checked Amazon for Bryson's book but ordered this one instead (I love the outdoors and have been on parts of the Appalachian trail).Was I pleasantly surprised! I found myself laughing out loud from the start of the book to the end. The book is a great blend of writing about the outdoors, people, history, and adventure. On a serious note, the book is a lengthy critique of how we pretty much systematically trash the world and the peculiar way Americans relate to nature (and to living our lives, really)."
3,Packs plenty of laughs,"I must admit that this is one of the funniest books I've read in a while. Unfortunately, much of the humor was at the expense of people who Bryson encountered along the trail. In the book Bryson often went for the cheap laugh. As a Georgia resident I took offense at his Georgia bashing. His criticism of places like the mountain town, Hiawassee, was incredibly unfair.Overall the book is well-written and informative, but I think Bryson could have accomplished just as much if he'd been a little less critical."
3,Not as good as I had hoped.,I finished the book (on Kindle) and was disappointed that he did not walk the entire trail. I thought that he had from the way the book is presented but he didn't and I feel that he should have been up front about it or not have written the book. The book was somewhat entertaining in parts.
3,"Entertaining, But Severely Dramatized","The book is engaging, funny, and, at times, informative; but the attentive reader will quickly notice that Bryson's tale is impossibly fantastic and, in all probability, not one that is typical of the realities of a march across the Appalachian Trail. Most of the characters are so overwrought in their actions and mannerisms that they mirror cartoon entities.It is a fun book to read, but don't take it too seriously."
5,Great Read,"The author does an excellent job keeping the story upbeat and humorous, a must read for anyone who likes the outdoors."
4,He walked more than I have,"I sought this book out at my local library. It started out fantastic, upbeat and humorous. I like the author and his walking partner a lot. Then something happened about the time they start skipping sections of the trail. The magic was gone. The story meandered off into geology and sociology lectures. I didn't want that! I wanted a vicarious hiking experience. It is probably what happens in the majority of AT hikes. Even so, I am glad I read it. Thank you, Mr. Bryson, for walking the AT."
4,You will laugh and shake your head,"A quick,easy, humorous read! Learn about the immensity of the Appalachain mountains and how the mountains and the trail were formed. Learn of the origins, diversity and extincion of flora and fauna of the Appalachain mountains. Read about climates along the trail, from rain and snow to sticky, hot, humid heat, sometimes in a matter of minutes. Envy experienced hikers and laugh out loud at less experienced hikers, such as the pair in this book. Feel disappoinment at the infractions, disregard and neglect of our forefathers and currently, us, in dealing with natural sites in America. Yes, the author wants to raise our awareness of nature. If you are opposed to such suggestions, this is is still a funny account of a hike on the AT. In any case, I was inspired to add the AT to my ""bucket list"" and resolved to add composting to my recylcing efforts in my own little green space of home!"
4,laugh out loud episodes,"This is the second time I have read this book. It is the perfect book to read while traveling...unless u crashed, all travel hassles are small compared with BB crazy funny suffering on the AP...this is a great read to put all in perspective....enjoy!"
3,"With Bryson, You Know what You're Getting","Bryson is a fun writer, although I find his humor to be a bit too sarcastic (bordering on mean-spirited) at times. As a history and general description of the trail, this is worth the read. I was actually surprised how much of the trail Bryson and his friend did - almost half if my math is right. Along the way you get plenty of insight into not only the natural beauty of the AT, but the social strata that it touches. Not a masterpiece, but an easy one-day read."
2,Good book but.....,I enjoyed this book. It presented an enjoyable picture of what may be expected on a hike of this nature. Insights and observations are keen and delivered with humor.This would be a 5 star book for me except for the fact that the publishers chose to make it not lendable. It's what people do with good books and it helps to get the word around.I am going to look for this in the future and will be less likely to purchase an ebook with the restriction.
5,Thoroughly enjoyed it,"When the author and his old friend take on the wild and wooly Appalachian Trail, we are the lucky ones. We get to hear all about the grit, splendor and interplay between two unlikely travel companions through Bryson's wit and keen senses, from the comfort of our armchairs. It appears there's a film adaptation in the works: [...] Looking forward to it!"
2,I thought the author would never reach the end of the trail,I have read all of Bill Bryson's books and enjoyed them all immensely but I have been disappointed by this book. Despite some hilarious moments the book is overlong and very repetitive.
2,Joe Average goes hiking,"Mildly amusing, a little flaky. Besides not being able to fulfill his promise to himself, except for losing weight (which in his other books, I guess, is a very important thing to him - even to the point of judging other people) the author has done a minimal amount of research. History, geology, and life-sciences are alluded to in an abridged way in little lumps easily digested by slightly-better-educated people.Emerson he is not. The only character worth anything is Katz, a part-way companion. One gets the feeling that, by inserting 'Ecologically correct' paragraphs, he knows his nearly blank experiences (minus Katz) will sell the book by themselves.Hopefuly the author isn't just another ""Tell them what they want to hear"" hypocrite who knows how to sell books...anecdotes with 'changed names', as written, seem contrived on occasion."
2,Someone needs to go and pick up Katz's trash!,Many of you have covered the necessary points in reviewing this book. I however wanted to make loud and clear that the author and his buddy Katz have an evidently blatant disregard for nature and the environment. The book was funny in places BUT I cannot seem to wash my mouth of the foul taste left by the fact that these two guys walked around littering the forest. And then to market it under the pretense that it is somekind of environmental or nature-loving novel? Boo.
4,Journey to the heart by foot,"This book gives a descriptive insight not only into the history and aspects of the Appalacian Trail but also into the culture and requirements of what it is that makes one a true hiker. This book adds hilarious comic relief to the seriousness of hiking this 2,200 mile trail. Although dissapointing at some points, Bryson and Katz are wonderful traveling companions and eventually prove themselves as ""mountain-men."" The book does have an overflow of history and triteful facts that may become slightly repititious, but overall the book is wonderfully written and completely inspiring to all those who wish to mix up their carpool and Starbucks orientated lives."
4,A Hoot!!!!,Seriousness spiked with the humor of every day observations made by Bryson. One of the best books I have read this summer. The book does slow down in Part 2 but it was a great read that I didn't want to put down.
4,Benchley on the Appalachian Trail,"This is the first book of Bryson's I've read, and I'm looking forward to reading them all! Bill Bryson reminds me very much of Robert Benchley, although it's difficult to imagine Benchley on the trail with a big pack. My very favorite parts of the book were when Katz and Bryson were hiking together; I missed Katz when he dropped out for a while to work in Des Moines. While missing Katz, though, I enjoyed Bryson's pull-no-punches discussion of the fate of the AT, and the ham-handed role the national park service has played in its existence."
4,"Typical, comical, Bryson..........","Bill Bryson is one of the most humorous travel writers of our time. His light, whimisical, and, sometimes, devestatingly acerbic wit, makes each of his efforts a page-turner. In A Walk in the Woods, Bryson recounts his failed attempt, with the hilariously incorrigible Steve Katz in tow, to traverse the Appalachian Trail from south to north. Though Bryson and Katz are unsuccessful, this book, like all his others, is a joy to read. If you're looking for a fun book that can be consumed in short order, try this or any other of Bryson's books."
5,Laughing All The Way,I read this book aloud to my father on a trip to Virginia right after it came out in Hardback. It had us laughing out loud and heartily all the way there and back. If you are in the least bit interested in the Appalachian Trail you will eat this up. Bryson does a wonderful job of mixing comedy in with fact. One of my favorite books of all time!
4,Armchair traveling at its best.,"I found A Walk in The Woods entertaining and that is the point of travelogues. I read it during a 2 day snowstorm and it took me away when I was ready to go nuts. Bill Bryson shares his experiences of his decidedly wild hair-ish type expedition to go on a hike of a lifetime. Only trouble was he hadn't hiked like that before and didn't have anyone to go with him at first. That doesn't stop his determination and the result is hardwork for him, and enjoyment for us who would never experience such a thing otherwise.What it isn't: it's not a guide book for the Appalachian Trail. It's not a how-to-book for hikers; it doesn't have any maps or trails. It's a travel memoir, nothing more. If you are looking to do a little traveling in mind only, then it will be enjoyable. If you're wanting more hard fact information and details on the trail itself, then this isn't what you're looking for."
3,Very entertaining.,"If you are a hiker or a wanna-be hiker this book will keep you laughing. I do alot of hiking and lead hikes, the chapters with ""Mary Ellen"" are easy to relate to when I consider some of the people who I have come across on the trail. The book will bring a smile to your face long after reading it."
2,definitely NOT one of his best,"A Walk in the Woods is by far Bryson's weakest book. While enjoyable and well researched it lacks the incisive wit and keen eye of ""Notes from a Small Island"", ""Neither Here Nor There"", or ""Mother Tongue"". Best borrowed from the library or bought in a money saving paperback edition."
4,Bill and Katz excellent adventure!,"A real fun read. Bryson is funny,determined and hopeless all at the same time.His hiking partner Katz is a combination of every hiker I've brought along my travels from boy scouts to high mountain treks. I don't know how many times I laughed out loud while reading Bryson's account of his friend on the trail. On the serious side the book is an excellent story of the bonding that occurs when people enter the woods on a hike together.You can know someone for years, but go on a extended hike with them and you'll come away with a new feeling about them. Bryson does a nice job telling about the trail, it's history, beauty & vulnerability. A must read for outdoor enthusiats."
1,Not About Thru-Hiking,**********SPOILER********If you're like me and you hope to someday hike the AT then you were probably hoping for a story about what it was really like. THis was not it.**He rambles on ALOT about history and facts about the trail or the area.**At the end he totals up his miles and it comes to around 800 (the AT is more than 2150)**He leaves after a few weeks and does a bunch of day hikes. Skipping parts he doesn't like**He gives up on the 100 mile wilderness after a few daysI read Becoming Odessa first. She does a little slackpacking and leaves the trail a few times but makes it the whole way. From blisters to the first poo in the woods. I was hoping this book would be more than that. I was hoping to hear another perspective on what goes on. What you have to overcome. I want to know what it was like actually thru-hiking the entire AT.
3,Whine - Whine - Whine,"I was disappointed with how the Appalachian Trail (AT) was portrayed. The author projected a ""better than thou"" attitude and was obviously miserable. He also spent way too much time writing obscure history lessons. There are a few humorous notes, but if you are looking for a book that describes the impact the AT has on thru-hikers then this is not the book for you."
2,So what was this book supposed to be about?,"This book definitely did not meet my expectations. If there was any humor intended (as the jacket suggested), it was completely missed on me. What I did hear was: whining about the forest service, whining about fat people, whining about Southerners, whining about people who talk a lot, etc. Just count the number of times Mr. Bryson said something nice about someone he mentioned in the book. Go ahead... You're right. If you are not just like him (with that snappy British accent), you are pond scum. When I read a book about the AT I expect to hear about the natural beauty, the adventures, the grueling hike...NOT about how stupid everyone else is and how the author disagrees with every decision the government has made since 1930. A waste of money in my view."
3,A long walk,"This is a not so much a story about a hike on the appalachian trail as it is a comment on how America takes care of it's natural resources. I studied forestry for 2 years and often while reading this I felt like I was back in the lecture hall. The part of the book that was about his actual hike was funny even if it was a bit crude. But, much of the book was a bit preachy. I found myself skimming parts of the book much like he skimmed part of the appalachian trail just because I didn't want to hear anymore from someone who clearly doesn't like a lot of things about America. No wonder he lived in England so long. If you want real outdoor humor, read something by Patrick McManus. If you want a glimpse of appalachian trail hiking life, this isn't a bad book."
4,A Walk in the Woods,"This is not a reverent account of hiking the Appalachian Trail, and it doesn't come even close to a gear and procedure report. Bryson inclines to the humorous, moreso in early chapters, along with patches of solemn ecological lectures and explosive sneering scorn at what he sees as stupidity. His hiking companion is a literary simplification for comedic effect. I sense Mark Twain's Roughing It far in the background.Bryson is an excellent writer, but if this is what hiking the Appalachian Trail is like, I'll pass."
1,Mr. Bryson...Bloody Arrogant,"It is quite obvious while reading ""A Walk in the Woods"" that Bill Bryson thinks quite a lot of himself and very little of anyone else he comes into contact with. Unfortunatly for him, the most pathetic charachter in the novel is himself. He is a laughably poor hiker, he spends most of his time driving around hiking small sections of the trail before moving on. Most of the humor in the book is unintentional as Bryson vainly attempts to defend his multiple blunders and his miserably inadequate attempt at a long distance hike."
1,Not a good book,"The book is humorous in places, but most of this humor is at someone's expense. The author's superior than thou criticism for anyone or anything south of the New Jersey border gets old fast. In his view all southerners are inbread idiots, those who help him are uneducated morons, and the towns that befriend him are ugly places where demented banjo players are eyeing him for the kill. When he's not slamming those who help him along, he gives long and boring history lessons on the region, before he moves on to let us know why God doesn't exist and Darwin is a hero. He also quits the trail after 71 miles when he gets to Gatlinburg, TN, coming back to it infrequently to hike a day in PA here, or a couple of days in ME later. To me this was a sad book of failed dreams and cynical opinions, full of his lack of faith and insulting stabs at those who would help him along. If you want a book about the AT that will help you quit, this is it."
2,"A trifle amusing perhaps, but take it with a grain of salt..","I couldn't finish this book.As an avid backpacker (with a somewhere over a thousand miles under my belt by now...) I was looking forward to reading a humourous account of an AT thru-hike. But after the second chapter, when Bryson's dsicussion of black bear behavior was just flat *wrong*, I couldn't read anymore.Sorry folks, there's such a thing as creative liscense, but Bryson stretched the truth a bit too thin in order to make his jokes for me. If you enjoy his work, and don't enjoy the outdoors, perhaps you'll enjoy his book. If you do enjoy the outdoors, I'd recommend skipping it."
1,"If you backpack, don't read this book","The most interesting parts about this book are the little tangents the author goes into (the American Chestnut, the history of PA mining, mountain lions, and deaths on the AT). The thing is, you can learn all about those things in more depth in better books. This book? This isn't the spirit of thru-hiking in the least. If you like thru-hiking, internet blogs are one of the best sources of personal experiences from people who have a positive view of nature and appreciate the athleticism of hiking. If you want a better book about someone who is less into the challenge of hiking, Cheryl Strayed's ""Wild"" is a better book."
4,GREAT!,"Bryson's sarcasm and ability to laugh not only at his peers but himself is a refreshing way to share what could be an overwhelmingly informative and weighty story. I could really relate to Bryson and his companion, Katz. I found myself laughing out loud repeatedly. The way history and issues are woven in to one man's journey is wonderful."
3,A funny if opportunistic book.,"The book is an interesting and funny read. It's best when being funny; tiresome when being moralistic. I do fault Bryson for quitting the trail and then writing about the experience. It's like taking numerous rest stops and long breaks during a marathon and writing about what it's like to run a marathon. All in all, an informative and funny read, but too glib and opportunistic for my taste. Will he next write about doing an open heart surgery after stopping in the middle and not sewing up the patient's chest?"
3,Bill's Walk,"I love laughing out loud with Bill. Once again he cracked me up. I found this book slightly more tedious than all his other ones because of so much factual history and details about the national parks. But over-all, I appreciated his candor, relished in his irreverent wit, and laughed out loud. Thanks, Bill."
3,Entertaining,"Though it had its share of disappointments, I did enjoy this book. Bryson tells his story of hiking sections of the Appalachian Trail with creativity and humor, though I must say I appreciated his description of preparing for the trail even more than I did the trail itself. At some points he incorporates too many historical and geological facts into his writing, which may bore readers. Whether he is justified in claiming that he did actually hike the AT can be argued. Many times I felt the book to be abrupt and jumpy, skipping for trail to suburbia and back to trail again in a matter of sentences. I'm not sure if the portion of the title referring to ""rediscovering America"" is appropriate: I expected Bryson to develop deeper relationships and make more meaningful evaluations of those he met on the trail, rather than resorting to stereotypes. Nevertheless, I was entertained by this book."
1,Save your money,"This book could have been titled, ""Complaining About the AT."" Bryson puts down the towns near the AT. He gripes about the shelters and the trail conditions. Everyone he met on the trail was either crazy, rude or stupid. He second guesses decisions made by the Forest Service decades ago. It is a good thing he hiked only a third of the trail. That fact probably saved his readers triple the grumbling. This book seriously tested my resolve to ALWAYS complete every book which I start reading."
5,LIONS AND TIGERS AND BEARS,"Bill Bryson is not just a humorous writer. He doesn't write just to entertain or inform or both. He writes out of the sheer love of the language which is what makes this narrative/local history succeed. When a writer works this hard at the craft, these other things just happen.I had been told to steer clear of this one by serious reader friends as is often the case with books that are enormously popular. But it turned out to be the best summer read. There are numerous laugh out loud sequences in the narrative and Bryson's delving into historical backdrops is mostly informative without sacrificing too much of the narrative momentum. I highly reccomend this exceptional prose stylist."
4,A walk very much enjoyed...,"This was my first venture at a book by Bill Bryson. Suffice to say, it won't be my last. I find his writing clear, clever and constantly entertaining. Though I did find a bit slow point about 3/4 of the way through, it did serve a purpose as I needed a break from laughing. I hope you enjoy as much as I did."
3,A trip worth taking,"This isn't Bryson's best or funniest book (""Neither Here Nor There"" wins on that account), but it may be his most sincere and heartfelt. He captures that peculiar joy of long distant walking, where simple things -- a cold drink of water, a candy bar, a warm place to sleep -- take on the glow of supreme pleasure. Where the view from a summit obtained after great effort has the crystal clarity of a primal vision. And he doesn't skimp on the difficult parts: the ache of a heavy pack, the sweat of a steep climb or the monotony of a long trudge through unfamiliar woods. He effortlessly weaves in the fascinating history of the trail (bears, disasters and all) and leaves the reader wanting more. Best of all, he has Katz! What a great hiking companion. I sympathized with him at every painful, gasping step. More cream soda! This is a great book for anyone who has ever been in the woods or thought about it. Makes you want to put on your pack and take a hike!"
4,Dry humor and lots of useful information,"Bryson's book is one of several dozen that thru-hikers (or would-be thru-hikers) have written about the Appalachian Trail. What distinguishes his book is the marvelous dry humor, refreshing self-deprecation, and abundant information about the history, geology, and ecology of the areas he visited. Of all the books about the trail, this one is by far the most entertaining and the best piece of writing. I would not recommend the book highly for the general reader, but for someone interested in hiking or the Appalachian Trail, it's a must-read (IMHO)."
4,Fun but...,I found this book very funny and fun to read as well. The only thing that I didn't like about this book was the fact that he really didn't walk that much of the trial. He is a great writer and I wished he had walked the whole thing so he could have written about it. I guess maybe he'll do a sequel.
4,Rip-roaring fun until the hike stalls...,"I would concur with a lot of readers in saying that what starts out as a gut-busting book starts to fade in the end. Once hiking partner Katz leaves the story, it dulls to common prose. I read the last part of the book anticipating Katz' return, and leafed through to see if his name pops up again, but Katz has hung up the boots for good. I did finish the book but don't be afraid to stop once Katz leaves the trail. You won't be missing much. Nevertheless the first half is highly HIGHLY recommended. That first half earns 5 stars, 2 for the bum ending."
2,How not to discover the Appalachian Trail,"This book has obviously appealed to many readers. Some seem to be attracted by the humour, others by the subject matter and many by the writing skills of the author himself. There are some interesting factoids buried in this book, and some descriptive passages were terrific.This is the first of Mr Bryson's books that I have not enjoyed. The antics of Messrs Bryson and Katz, two middle-aged, ego-centric and totally underprepared hikers, irritated me enormously.I am glad that this is not the first of Mr Bryson's books I have read. If it was, it would almost certainly be the last.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
2,Overrated and Diluted Entertainment,"As an avid hiker with a good sense of humor, I expected this book to be right up my alley. But, halfway through the book, I found each page to become heavier than the last until I had to set the book down for fear of slipping a disk.To sum it up, the anecdotes were lame, the description of his experience was lackluster, and I felt more pity for the writer than a sense of comaraderie.I believe I would rather have enjoyed an AT book written by someone who had hiked the trail for the experience, instead of the book publishing potential."
2,Don't buy this book It starts very strong finishes very weak,"This book is quite amusing until Bryson betrays his readers by getting off the trail. I thought I was going to read the reflections of a thru hiker and I felt misled not only by the book but also by the pre-publication promotion of the book which led you to believe he did. It reads like Bryson actually runs out of things to say once he has quit hiking but still has 100 pages to fill as part of his contract with his publisher. I would not have bought the book if I knew so much of it was him DRIVING????? to various parts of the trail and remarking on what was there. Hell , I can do that myself. The first 100 pages are laugh out loud hoot but most of the rest is disposable filler material. Don't buy this book, borrow it and send its author and the publisher a message about putting out half finished writing and misleading the public. I wonder what the author has to say about how his readership has been misled?"
4,great fun--if you're not easily offended,"this is a hilarious book! as usual, bryson's great sense of sarcastic shines throughout his adventure. i thought his explanation of the origin of the AT was almost reverential. . .he gave a respectful account of how it came to be. that he didn't hike the entire thing seems almost irrelevant: hooray for all those thru-hikers who DID make it. . .bryson didnt make it but, hey, lighten up-- he gave us many laughs along the way."
3,Kind of funny,"Bill Bryson's book made me snigger out soft,its a tale of two overweight , out of shape, wannabe hikers who plod through approx 30% of the AT.Its littered with cruel,mean and kind of funny comments on fellowhikers,rangers and a lot of others whom he encounters on his hike ,and includes his buddy Katz and himself.There is also a lot of statistics wedged in, on the Appalachian Trail .If you are not a dedicated hiker,who may find the frivolity of the book and the ineptness of the author and his buddy who gave it up well before they attained their summit upsetting, the book is a good read .At the end of it this is something I'd like to say to Bryson, (in his own words )about the rediscovering America bit ""You really are shitting us aren't you?"""
5,Great for those who have experienced the AT.,"Some 22 years ago, as a recent high school graduate, I and a few of my classmates hiked a portion of the Appalachian Trail for the first time. It was one of the best experiences of my life and Bill Bryson has allowed me to relive my youth. I am at that tenuous age (do the math) looking for that ""City Slicker"" adventure and just might consider embarking once again on the AT.Before I do though, I am going to stock-up on other Bill Bryson titles."
3,"A great start, but a weak finish","I was hoping for more personal interaction with the people on the trail in this book. He speaks on the environment (verbosely) and barely grazes the depth of the characters he encountered. There are some gems in here, but could have been better."
4,A Walk In The Woods,I think I'm going to miss Bryson and Katz. Bryson blended facts and figures with a great story to describe the AT. It was a great tale of two ordinary guys taking on a great adventure.
1,Pitiful tale,"I was excited when I saw a book about the AT. A few funny incidents, unfortuately the rest of the book whines and Bryson contradicts himself usually in the next chapter. If readers want to know about the AT, many great books out there, unfortuately this isn't one of them!!!!"
3,It could have been a great book. Could have been.,"This book starts out really great, laugh out loud comedy great. It doesn't remain great. Bryson feels the need to weave negativity into this book at every chapter. I kid not the man basically blames acid rain on the National Park Services. Actually he blames everything on acid rain and the National Park Service. ""The weather is unusually warm, must be due to some park ranger.""Don't get me wrong there are parts of the book that are great, can't put the book down great, but then he drifts off into his opinion of something and ruins the book. So if a good read laced with negativity is your thing, dig in, otherwise look for another book."
2,"Great start, but fizzled out","This book was recommended to me by a friend and fellow nature enthusiast. He was part of the way through the book when he told me how much he enjoyed it. A few weeks later I decided to buy the book for myself. I reported back to him my purchase, but it was too late. I was adamant about reading the book but did not want any details from him as to the nature of it. The first third of the book was an interesting story of the authors' experiences, but shortly after that, the book took a turn towards a more historical view of the trail. To be brief, if I wanted to learn about the history of the trail, I would have bought a history book. I gave the book the extra star because I did enjoy hearing about his journey, but at the end I was left feeling unfulfilled."
1,"""Brysoning""","Amongst this year's thruhikers, when one messes up or does something un-clever on the trail, they are said to ""Bryson"". Example: ""I really Brysoned when I turned the wrong way at the side trail this morning."" ""I really Brysoned when I mistook my fuel bottle for my water bottle.""For a more realistic view of hiking the AT, read something other than this book."
5,A sense of humour is lost on some people,"This is not a guide to hiking the Appalacian Trail. It is not a how-to book in any way, shape, or form. It is, as it's supposed to be, a very, very funny read about a mis-adventure on the AT between two guys with an awkward and recently-renewed friendship. Bryson's wit is sarcastic, caustic, self-depreciating, and his phrase can turn on a dime. [Or a pound Stirling, possibly -- he spent 20 years living in Europe and speaks fluent British and American English.] If you are a sensitive and fragile reader, however, who starts pearl-clutching at stereotypes or perceived criticisms, you should probably steer clear."
1,Do Not Bother Reading This Book,I was very disappointed at this wimp's view of the AT. I can not believe that he had the audacity to write the book under the pretense of walking the whole thing and he did not even walk one third of it.
3,Grammer mistakes galore!,"I loved this book but I'll be darned if there wasn't at least one mistake in the translation to the kindle version every few pages. One or two misplaced commas I can deal with but not the thirty+ mistakes that I alone found. It became distracting after awhile and it is obvious no one proofreads these Kindle versions before they are uploaded for folks to buy.C'mon Amazon, if you want this Kindle thing to succeed, you're going to have to at least give these things a once-over.Otherwise, loved the book. Great story and appreciated the author's humour."
4,I like Bryson but this is not my favorite,"Typical Bryson- witty, insightful, well researched, and tangential (in a good way). This is a good read and worth your coin. You will find yourself laughing out loud from his observations and perspectives. Who knew the Corps of Engineers and the National Park Service could be so funny (but not in a good way)!So far I've read A Brief History of Nearly Everything, this, and The Thunderbolt Kid. I would rank them in that order for favorites also.I see many people tag this book as about hiking and backpacking. I'm not sure I think that's the best tag. The book is much more about the human condition and what makes people tick. I've read many adventure books and am an outdoors enthusiast, and I definitely do not find this to fit into that genre at all (after all he skips most of the trail)."
5,"Funny, Eye Opening. A book of love.","Bill's use of humor to describe his experiences on his hike of the AT was quite refreshing. In several parts of the book, I actually broke out in very loud peals of laughter -- not just in one but many parts of the book.I especially found his description of some of the major sites and our impact on the environment quite eye popping. He describes parts of the country that I would probably never read about in a general visitors' guide because of the lack of commerce and access routes. However, his description of these places shows the love that he has for the land that he is crossing.While it is true that at times he seems to be a bit finger wagging, I found that it is well warranted and educational. I learned so much without realizing that I was being educated.Overall, I would personally love to undertake parts of the trip, just to see those same sights. But if I do, I'll be sure to pack an extra set of Pop Tarts for trading currency."
5,Walk in the Woods,"Excellent. Well documented and organized. A must read for anyone thinking about doioing the trail, but even good reading for even a virtual walk int the woods."
4,Amusing,"This was an entertaining book, Bill has a way with words and is a good humorist. As far as him claiming he hiked the trail, that certainly isn't true. He takes a month break, drives through hundreds of miles of it and cannot even complete the last 100 miles in Maine without backing out.Other then that, there is a great deal of information and insight on the Appalachian Trail."
2,Fair,"I am personally familiar with the Appalachian Trail and disappointed that an out-of shape middle aged man would even attempt such a hike and then dump on its difficulty. Exactly what did he expect? He drove from Knoxville to Roanoke, missing my area entirely . . . missing the mighty Roan Mountain and its Rhododendrun Gardens and wild strawberry patches. The end to end walkers are rarely heard about today. Either it is not done or it is no big deal for those who do it. The last I remember was an 18 year old who set a record of 2 months +/-.His style is overall negative toward the AT but I doubt few people and none I have ever known, had the objective of end to end. As an instructional book it works as in ""Don't try it"". Otherwise the tale is one of pain and no discernible pleasure. After a Chapter or two the story gets monotonous"
1,"Snore, man","My question is-- if he couldn't walk the entire trail, why did he write a book about it? I was disappointed that they gave up. I would have rather read an inspirational tale about how 2 out of shape guys pushed themselves to walk the AT from end to end. Who cares?"
1,I wanted to throw this book across the room.,"If you are a Christian person and love the great wilderness that God has given us you will dispise this book, although I do have to admit I was taken in with it for the first seven chapters. In the eight chapter I lost all respect for this man. Mr Bryson bashes the great state of Tennessee for trying to pass a law to prevent the teaching in their schools of EVOLUTION. At the same time he decides to rent a car and skip the trail from Gatlinburg, TN to Virginia. In my opinion, which I rarley ever give, I would have kept my personal opinions about religion vs evolution to myself. He also belittles every single person that is mentioned in this book with small exception of the lady at the AT Conference office/store in Harpers Ferry, WV. This is the first book I've read by Mr. Bryson and it will be my last. I'm just sorry that I spent 25.00 for it."
3,A Walk In The Woods,"A Walk In The Woods is a personal account of the author's adventures on the Appalachian Trail, or AT. The author, Bill Bryson, humorously recounts his mishaps, triumphs, and encounters on over 500 miles of this 2000+ mile trail. Not an experienced backpacker, the author and his friend, Katz, heroically adjust to trail life, and in very little time fall into the backpacking routine: walk, walk, walk, rest, eat, walk, walk, walk, eat, sleep, lather, rinse, and repeat.The author peppers his tale with interesting facts about the U.S. Forest Service, the history of the trail itself, mankind's abuses of nature, and information on various areas that he passes through.While I would have enjoyed a bit more detail at times, I was very happy with the overall content of the book. It is a very quick and enjoyable read, not to mention funny, and has a broad enough appeal for a very general audience. I can easily recommend this book to anyone who would enjoy an easy, relatively funny read."
4,A Good Read for Someone with Experience,"I read the book before I started backpacking and used Bryson's descriptions for making my decision on where to tackle a section of the AT. I went back later on to read it again, and enjoyed it more the second time. If you have gone through the same sorts of experiences on the AT, met similar people, been in the same areas, and delt with the same problems, its an excellent read. Granted it slows down in part two, but if you're interested in some history and background of the AT it doesn't matter. Part one a must read for those who would like a taste of the AT. Bryson is honest and at times very hilarious about his experiences and lack of skill. You should not read it if backpacking or the Appalachian Trail is of no interest to you."
2,"As a hiker, the author Cheated","Hello. I was enjoying the book until about 1/2 way through, when the author and his companion decide to rent a car and drive from Knoxville to Roanoke. That's a distance of 259 McNally altas miles, but who knows how many Blue Ridge Mountain AT miles. This (driving instead of hiking) is like a football player selling a book about his experiences in the Super Bowl, but by the way he decided to sit out the second quarter because he was tired.So, you may read this book for just the fun of it, but don't expect to learn about hiking. To be accurate, the title should be ""A Walk and a Drive and a Walk"", but then who would buy it."
3,Mixed messages,"Bryson tries to come across as environmentally conscious, but he finds humor and satisfaction is smashing mice with a metal cup. By the end, I really didn't like him, even though I agreed with some of his views. His humor is that Stephen King style--male, adolescent, and firmly based on denigrating everything within sight. He seems to try to elevate himself by tearing everything else down. He does a good job with the background ""lore"" he provides, though. When he doesn't succumb to the temptation to be cute, he's a good observer."
3,A Partial Walk through the Woods,"I was disappointed by this book, mostly because the first 20 or so pages are enjoyable (reading them at the bookstore convinced me to buy the book) but the story loses steam fairly quickly. If you're expecting the story of a neophyte that becomes a capable hiker, you won't find it here; rather, there are more hotel rooms and shortcuts than I expected."
5,The quintessential travelogue,"Bryson's book is what all travelogues ought to be. Part informative, part adventure, part humorous, and part introspective. He doesn't get too bogged down in any one of these, but provides enough to make this a well-rounded look at this unique piece of America. His travelling companion, Katz, is one of the most entertaining characters in this or any other book in this genre. I hope he travels with him more often in future sojourns."
4,humor-based education,"Bill Bryson's A WALK IN THE WOODS is extremly informative and humorous at the same time. He makes very valid points about the status of Americas environment and the danger it faces. If you want to learn more about the politics involved with the maintanence of Americas beauty, and be entertained by an author who is not shy to poke fun at himself and his travel companion, then this is definitly for you."
1,False advertising,"An okay book....On the surface, you assume it is written by a guy who claimed to have hiked the entire AT. After reading it, you realize he was a stuck up ideologue who was basically lazy. He shows up in the Gatlinburg area (A tacky area in and of itself), sees some headline on a newspaper about the Scopes Trial, decides there are too many Christians in that town, and takes a taxi cab out of the area to the next point on the trail... later he gets tired of hiking and decides to go home and hike the trail on the weekends... or when he has time, until he has covered it all. I liked the guy at the start of the book... by the end I felt like he swindled me out of the cost of the book,"
1,Hiking??,"Having only recently finished this book, the antagonism it bought me is still fresh in my mind. A hiker myself, I was a little surprised at the whole 'eating in restaurants and sleeping hotels' thing...its one thing to go hiking, its another to stop in for a bit of 3 star luxury every week or so. And he calls himself a hiker.The incessant paragraphs/half chapters about the ins and outs of the trail's history, nature and scientific breakdown drove me up the wall. If I wanted to know about the flora and fauna of the Appalachian Trail and the greater part of North America I would have purchased a book on the subject. I found myself thinking that if the actual trail-log parts were the only parts to be published (and I must say they WERE well written and DID bring a laugh), it would amount to about 50 pages and could have been read in a few hours rather than days.All in all, the sarcasm and humour were well written, but it was a somewhat frustrating piece of reading."
1,Elitist and arrogant,"I have made it to page 84 and I don't think I can read any further. At this point in the book Bryson is in Franklin, NC. ""Late on the third afternoon I stood in a Burger King and studied, with absorbtion, the photographs of the manager and his exectutive crew (reflecting on the curious fact that people who go into hamburger management always look as if their mother slept with Goofy), then slid one pace to the right to examine the Employee of the Month awards. It was then that I realized I had to get out of Franklin."" If you find this sort of elitist humor funny, then this book is for you. Also this book reads like fiction. Too much of it is not believable and appears to me to be written to make the story more interesting and therefore more publishable."
2,Like hiking the trail... tedious,"I'm giving this book 2 stars because that's pretty close to the amount of the trail he actually hiked (and hated, if I remember correctly, because he only liked Virginia and the bulk of what he hiked was the southern part of the trail). And if the book isn't about hiking (and smoking and littering along a wilderness trail), but about rediscovering America, then he gets two stars as well. After reading this book, I would believe that Americans (especially those living in the South), are inbred, stupid and have incredibly ugly towns. He is at once arrogant and narrow-minded, somehow believing that he is the only intelligent being on the planet.I liked the first half and even laughed out loud, but it became increasingly tedious (much like hiking the trail according to him- I would have liked to drop out of his narrative like he dropped off the trail)... and it's not about hiking the AT, nor is it a fair representation of America."
4,"A quick, entertaining stroll","The humor of Bryson's book, an account of an unathletic amateur attempting to hike the AT, is a welcome relief from the clannishness and superiority that distinguishes the modern cults of extreme athletic performance (and much of modern athletic writing). Some of the critics of Bryson's book have fixated on the fact that he did not finish the trail. Their petty outrage and derision only reinforce, in my mind, a concluding thought of Bryson's: numbers are a poor tool for measuring human experience. Besides, and perhaps more importantly, Bryson remains one of the very few authors able to write about bodily functions in such a self-deprecating and unusual fashion that I cannot help but laugh out loud. A quick and entertaining read."
3,A laugh-out-loud book about hiking,"Despite all the references to people dying on the trail, reading this book made me want to hike the Appalachian Trail. This book is a hilarious travelogue of hiking in the Eastern United States. It also includes interesting information about the history of the trail. Recommended for light entertaining reading."
4,Truly an Armchair Getaway filled with fun,"I bought this book never having heard of Bill Bryson, (being 24 and fresh out of the college scene, may I be forgiven?) and desperately needing to kill time at my meaningless desk job, this was the perfect escape. Your on a trip in your american outback with a witty Bill. I learned so many interesting otherwise unknown facts about the states which the trail passes through. And in between the funny moments and zany characters that cross Bill's path on the trail, there are shocking, creepy moments of bitter truth about the murders and disappearances that took place on the AT. I never truly gave much thought to the threat of bears anytime I went hiking, and this book definately made me give it second thought.Why does this book deserve a read? It is simply fun and interesting, and as I said, it took me away from my desk job and onto the trail, as far as Bill had gone. I left this book wanting to hear from Bill, to ask him where we would be going next..."
4,The Bill Bryson audiotapes,"I have become addicted to Bill Bryson tapes and CDs for listening entertainment while driving here and there for shopping and errands...have now gone through In a Sunburned Country, Neither Here nor There, Notes from a Small Island, and currently A Walk in the Woods. I find myself extending the drive home from errand-running just to listen to the latest Bryson adventure. I shouldn't admit this on an Amazon[.com] site, but all of the CDs and tapes I listen to are courtesy of our public library system. However you get them... I highly recommend the aforementioned Bryson titles for your driving pleasure!"
4,"A simple, entertaining read.","As a former backpacker, I read this book not as a tutorial, or as a grand statement of purpose and dedication, but to be entertained for a few minutes every day. That is exactly what I got. An enjoyable read without any pretense or attempts at grand statements. I sent it to my brother and he enjoyed it as much as I did.I came to AMAZON to look for other Bryson titles."
3,"Funny, light reading","A light, quick read with a lot of laughs thrown in. Sure, the ending is disappointing, but it's hard to get bored with any perspective of the AT."
5,I laughed out loud,"I laughed out loud at times, so some of the humor is that good. Bryson is at his most interesting when he describes things that bore him. His descriptions of dull dismal towns held me more than the descriptions of beautiful trees and mountains. Reading the employee of the month plaque at a Burger King was one of the best moments. He makes his greatest characters out of the most ordinary people. Some of the geology and geography and history was quite good but not great. McPhee does that stuff better. I preferred his account of his walk around Britain in a way, although it's not as funny. In that he does not digress but continuously narrates the journey. I don't suppose you could do that with the Appalachian Trail."
3,Half a Masterpiece,"Such a great start to the book. It read real well up to the point where Bryson got on his soapbox and couldn't step down. The journeys he and Katz took in the first half of the book where great. Then Bryson decided to editorialize as he stumbled throught the rest of the AT. If he would have continued the format and dialogue of the first half of the book, this clearly would be a classic hiking read. Instead, he interjected his agenda on all things environmental and got off the path (pun intended)! Not that I don't enjoy getting background info on the changing topography of New Hampshire or now extinct bird species, but enough with the generalizations! I enjoyed his wit and shared multiple laughs with him until he lost his way. I still would recommend reading it, even though it slows down considerably in the second half."
3,Disappointed in the Walk,"I was initially excited about reading this book as a humourous outdoor adventure. I was disappointed that it is more the tale of an elitist's bumbling experience in the woods.A walk in the woods is entertaining at times but likely more interesting for people who have little interest in ever hiking much less trying to hike the AT. Much of Bryson's insight from the experience was worrying about wild animals and further stereotyping ""backward hillbillies"" (of course all in the south) which means he missed much of the experience that would make this a great story. Wavering between extolling solitude and lamenting that there were not more facilities and services on the AT is bewildering. I'm sure this was a great experience for Bryson and that comes through in the story, but it is somewhat hard to correlate that with constantly not achieving any goals and goofing on the people he meets.....that is not really ""rediscovering america"""
4,"Camping, and Walking, and Bears. Oh My!","A Walk in the Woods is about 2 men who walk a portion to of the Appalachian Trail and find the untamed beauty of the trees. The author, Bill Bryson, captures how the trail looks and feels from when you take your first step to the last, tiring day of the trail. He incorporates humor and history into a best selling novel that captivates audiences. I really liked how you could learn facts about the trail, animals, plants, and how the trail is becoming a shopping mall if we keep doing the things we are doing to it. Bryson's experiences with his friend Katz are laugh out loud funny. From being scared of a bear to running from some ugly lady's husband, this book is a must read.I must say the second part of the book focuses more on the history of the trail and is disappointingly not as funny as the first part is a really good fun part.A Walk in the Woods is a great outdoor book for young adults to adults. I really enjoyed this book and I think you will too."
3,Okay,"I wasn't blown away by this book, nor was I totally put off like some reviewers. I just thought it was okay. There's some humor, a lot of sarcasm, and a bit of profanity - it's true. I enjoyed the details about the Appalachian Trail, but probably not enough to read it again."
5,Appalachian Trail - great book,Needed book for report in Geography Course at College.Actually good for all ages - great story and information - enjoyed
4,This was a selection for my Book Club,"A Book club selection by a husband of a member. Easy read, informational for some with no knowledge of the subject. This author knows a great deal of information about the workings of the parks system."
4,MUST READ,"Laugh out loud funny. A must read for any would-be hiker, which is why I read it. Thought provoking, funny, and informative."
5,A Honest Look at the Peaks and Valleys of Hiking the AT,"A Walk in the Woods was filled with many interesting and entertaining stories of the life of long distance hikers. It also provides and enlightening look at the histroy of the trail. Be warned, however, as it not only makes you want to go hike this trail youself, but also mentions snickers, buffets and ice cream a lot, which leads to cravings."
4,A Walk in his Words,Bryson is such an amazing writer. How he explains his small subtle problems on the trial with his friend makes you laugh and at the same time makes you curious on how the predicement will end. It's one of those books that you can really get sucked into by the description of the natural and the plot.His descriptions of nature is one of the reasons this book is so fantastic. He makes you feel like your actually there expierencing the cold weather and beautiful scenary.The only problem is that Bill Bryson has such a great knowledge of the Appalacian trial and although some of the facts are interesting they take up chapters of the book which can ruin the book for some.Overall if you are into adventure stories with humor this would be the one to read and if your someone like me who skims through the facts cahpters then the book is even more exciting.
3,I walked the Appalachian Trail too!,"I've done maybe a couple of miles of it in West Virginia and a few miles around the Delaware Water Gap, so I hiked the trail. If Bryson can get away with his absurd claim after skipping two thirds of the AT, then why shouldn't I get away with mine?Oh, well, the book succeeds as slapstick. Plus a good primer on the reasons, preparations, and companions NOT to have on a hard effort like the AT."
3,Was expecting more humor,"Don't get me wrong...I did find humor in this book, specifically the idiosyncratic Katz, but it was not the gut-clenching hilarity I had been promised by friends. I did enjoy the historical side-bars Bryson took that helped me form a clearer opinion of the U.S. Forest Service."
1,witless,"This reads like a book written just to get something published.Bill Bryson constantly reminds the reader of the difficulty of completing the trail. I felt exactly this way obout the book, only finishing it in the hopes it would get better, and then just because I knew it couldn't get any worse.Bryson's observations are bland and his humour has the air of someone poking fun at America for the benefit of foreigners. There is no passion for the subject or the experience."
1,Save a tree,"The work is just disappointing as a whole. Bryson quits the AT just south of the Smokies and from that point through the remainder of the book, his failure is reflected in his writing. He proceeds to criticize the park service, forest service, and various subsets of our (american) culture. He has the brass to end the book by stating that he did indeed complete the AT. I recommend seeing the AT for yourself rather than through Bryson's ill-tempered rants."
4,I enjoyed this book,"the first half of this book is just wonderful, in the second half he seems to lose his determination and a bit of the thread. I'd recommend it, but I can't quite give it five stars. I don't mind that he gave up. I just wish the story ended with the same punch with which it began."
2,"Heavy Going, but a Light Read","The book begins on a strong, humorous note but simmers down after a few chapters. I found Bill's chatty style to be tiresome about a third of the way through, however A Walk in the Woods does give the lonely Appalachian Trail a real personality."
2,Not up to scratch with his previous masterpieces,"Great, except for one complaint - too much history. All he seems to have done is hiked a bit of the way with a really fat, lazy person and had such a horrible time that he decided that he had better fill in all the boring details with historical facts. For a good historical book by Bryson, read Made in AMerica.One thing is true of all of Brysons books, you can pick any page and immediately be envelopeed in the story -t is captivating and humourous writing"
2,Not funny - just negative,"I have trudged through about 170 pages of this book, on the recommendation of my wife, who enjoyed it. I certainly hope I never have to share a trail shelter with someone this negative. Everyone is stupid, from Stonewall Jackson to the people he meets in his travels. Everything is worse than it was a year, a decade or a millenium ago. He talks environmentalism, yet shows no concern when he or his partner leave trash along the trail.I understand that some of this is meant to be satire, but I have found something funny perhaps three times. Yes, I laughed out loud once, but mostly I was annoyed.I certainly bear Bryson no grudge for not doing all of the trail. I hope he doesn't mind that I won't finish the book."
2,Misleading Discovery Along the AT,"The Appalachian Trail has a mystique...a soul journey on an American wilderness trail. Mr. Bryson's ""walk"" on small pieces of the trail misleads the reader. His sarcasm and criticism of the AT's purpose leads the reader to believe that the experience just is not worth it. From joke filled fears of bear encounters and murder in the dark shadows of the southern portion of the trail to biting accounts of his side trips through rural and poor towns near its path, Byron creates his own trail mythology. And, his message is, don't walk it. If scarcasm and ripping apart the essence of the wilderness hike is your thing, read it. If reflection on the beauty and personal journey on a preserved piece of American wilderness is, don't."
3,"entertaining, but not very focused","The book is a very good introduction to what hiking is really like for the average person. Some nicely-detailed moments give you a real feel for the experience of hiking the Appalachian Trail. I appreciated the honest tone, especially the comparison to hiking in Europe.However, the book veers into lame comedy at times (Bryson is not a ""comic genius,"" despite what the flap says), and at other times gets jarringly morbid with tales of childrens deaths and ecological hand-wringing. Some scenes, like his ex-alcoholic partner's lapse into drinking and subsequent excuses, seem very out-of-place, and don't help the narrative or the theme.The author tries too hard to make buffoons out of people he runs into, and his ""jokes"" about Deliverance-style hillbillies are childish and a bit telling. But that all said, it's still a fun read, and certainly a welcome change from the usual religous writings about hiking and camping."
4,Excellent eye opener for those unfamiliar with the AT,"This was a very humorous and enlightening book. This is probably not for serious hikers or those wanting hard-core material on the AT. This is an insight to the adventure taken by two men on the AT. Yep, they took shortcuts. Yep, they wandered off the trail. The book, though, is very insightful about life on the AT and those you encounter. Very well written, very funny, easy and fast to read."
2,A real teaser that only partially delivers,"Bill Bryson's ""A Walk in the Woods,"" has an excellent premise -- it looks to be a descriptive and subjective report on the Herculean adventure of walking the Appalachian Trail. When it does that, the book is enthralling. The problem is Bryson ""fills"" his book with too much narcissistic reportage about what he did when he was NOT walking the Trail -- mundane stuff like examining tourist traps and sophomoric humor about his travelling companion's quest for female companionship on their trail stops.Essentially, when Bryson writes from the woods -- the journey is fascinating and enlightening -- but as soon as he hits the pavement the level of interest plummets.Bryson wants to be Dave Barry when he makes a better (although more down-to-earth) John McPhee."
2,"Disappointing, Sarcastic Fictionalized Version of Trail Walk","This book is a great example of how ""creative writing"" kills a great story. Bryson is a good writer--but his sarcasm, constant profanity and insulting humor get in the way of what could have been an interesting story. He also has an arrogant attitude that demeans other people, including those closest to him. There will probably be Bryson fans who like this, but I came away not believing almost any of it--and not liking it."
2,misleading,"While there were some interesting and humorous stories in this book, overall it is a bad joke! Bryson basically had a book contract to write about his journey on the trail. He realized he had bitten off much more than he could chew, so he spent most of the book rationalizing how, via day hikes, he really, well sort of, well maybe, hiked the trail. His attitude towards and description of other hikers and local folk was also incredibly ethnocentric! He came across as a New England Yankee snob.He did not even come close! Sorry, but his publisher should have told him, ""hike the trail or no book."""
4,"Laugh Out Loud Funny at Times, Then Moving","I Highly recommend this enjoyable book. Bryson's ironic sense of humor is laugh out loud funny at times, but then as the book moves on the humor becomes less frequent and an almost meloncholia sets in when his co-hiker Katz leaves for a few months. Thankfully Katz returns and it is what happens next that is most moving. Cheers to Mr. Bryson. I will indeed be reading his other books."
5,One of my Favorite Books,The audio is worth the purchase of the CD in addition to the book. Very funny.
4,"Great, hangs a bit just before the end","I love Bill Bryson's writing. I'm about 90% of the way thorugh this book of his about walking the appalacian trail. When I was in Australia I read his book abotu Australia, In A Sunburned Country and loved it. It's been a long time since I've laughed outloud as many times reading a book as I did sunburned country. I liked it so much I immediately bought several of his other books and read them. A walk in the woods is second in my opinion behind sunburned country. Most of it is very funny and informative especially when he's hiking with his long lost buddy, it does slowdown a bit just before the end. He leaves the trail and breaks the whole flow of the book."
4,loved it,"I read this book to my family while on a road trip. We all loved it. The first half is very entertaining with comical passages about the author's apprehension about bears and people he might meet on the trail. The description of Gatlinberg made me laugh till I cried. Unfortunately, the author put all his creativity in the first half of the book so the last chapters were boring. Still a good read. sp"
4,Very Funny,"Haven't finished the book yet, but I've bitten through a great chunk. It's absolutely hilarious and has got me flippin' pages like a madwoman. This book was recommended to me from a woman at the gym (ironic?) and I didn't think it would be as funny as she had told me it was. Bryson has an amazing sense of humor, and knows a lot about what he's writing about. On a side note, the bear looks all cute and cuddly before you begin reading, but after you read about the bear accounts, you'll be wanting to hide from it... much like I did."
3,Highly entertaining--most of the time,"This was the first book I'd read by Bryson. I read it on the plane and laughed out loud a few times. The chapters written about hiking the trail with his friend are great, really funny. I really wish the book had been pared down to just that part of the adventure--about 3/4 of the book. His friend is seriously hilarious.He gets a little didactic when writing about the history of the trail, and I got a little impatient with that and scanned through it."
3,Moe and Curley Take a Hike,"After I read ""A Brief History of Nearly Everything"" I decided that Mr. Bryson was one of those rare writers that could teach and entertain at the same time. Unfortunately he fell a little short in both areas with this effort. The humor was clever but just too caustic for a southern boy like myself. He would readily admit the shortcomings of both he and his goofy companion but just as readily go into ""Deliverance"" jokes about every person he met on and off the trail, even taking a cheap shot at the Boyscouts! He did a fairly good job explaining the challenges of hiking the AT but had too many wanderings into political musings about the environment, the government, etc, etc, etc. Interesting read, just not great"
4,"Not a hiker but ""loved the book""","I read a review on A Walk in the Woods in the main newapaper in Boston, MA, from a literary club. I had not heard of Bill Bryson or the book but was so enticed by the review that I got the book from our local library. It was wonderful, I laughed, wanted to cry sometimes and encouraged my husband to read it. He, too, enjoyed it almost as much as I did. The bottom line is, I am ordering a copy for our library so I can loan it to others and, read it again."
3,"both funny and serious, an informative story lightly told","an interesting, informative story with hilarious moments and serious times told in a sincere but casual style, concentrating on the present events with only a little background history to make it cohesive"
4,Good if you like the outdoors,"I haven't finished this book yet but I'm almost there. I like to hike though I must admit I prefer day hikes to packing multiple days' worth of stuff on my back. For the most part, this book didn't disappoint me- it was both funny and informative.Some things do bug me though... Bryson and Katz can be surprisingly arrogant sometimes, and their sarcasm sometimes passes over into pettiness. For example, stealing another hiker's bootlaces is pretty immature, even if they are rude to you, as is making snide comments to an acquaintance's attempts at friendly conversation, which both Katz and Bryson do quite frequently. I also wish Bryson would tell us where he got some of his information. He says the average American walks something like a mile and half each week, and I remember reading somewhere else that it was seven miles a day... so who, if anyone, is right?Still, Bryson does a great job of weaving anecdotes with science, geography, and history. It's an entertaining book."
5,strongly recommended,"This is one of Bryson's best, and that says a lot. His careful descriptions transport you to the place and to the feeling. Bryson researches many facts related to his experiences on this hike and teaches about history, animal behavior, and biology with his own informal humor.Bryson's ""At Home"" is still my favorite, but I strongly recommend accompanying him on this very wonderful walk in the woods."
5,just to make sure this is mentioned...,"I always find it comical (?) when people who exercise are smokers. To Clarify, it's ALWAYS good for people to exercise as compared to Not Exercise (provided common sense is invoked). This book (1998) compared to today (2012) was a contrast in the above, I'm wondering if Bryson has ceased smoking (and, I hope he has).the Book, for me, is nicely divided between their narrative about their personal experiences (What time was that appointment with Beulah?) and factoids about the AT.A perfect summer read as I contemplate doing the I-90 to U.S. 2 section of the PCT."
4,Babes in the Woods,"I've always been fascinated by hiking the Appalachian Trail from one end to the other. It's a grueling journey, and even 30 years ago I knew deep down that it was beyond my abilities. Given my knee injuries, that's even more certain.Amazingly, Bill Bryson decides to try the 1500-mile trail. He finds that he isn't ready to do the entire hike, and that his hiking companion could barely make it through the first day. They both persist long enough to say that they gave it a good try, and Bryson's hilarious book is a highly entertaining account. It might dissuade the casual reader from trying the Appalachian through-hike, but the reader will have a great time anyway! Highly recommended"
4,Even my teenagers took off their headphones to listen!,"Perfect audio book for a long road trip to Yellowstone Nat'l Park. Entertaining, with lots of laugh-out-loud bits with some history and science snuck in here and there!"
2,Entertaining but misguided,"Parts of the book were very funny, but there were many more parts of this book that I struggled with.1. He spoke of the majesty and beauty of Mother Nature as though this were all an accident and never once gave any credit to God the Creator.2. HE NEVER FINISHED THE TRAIL. HE SKIPPED MAJOR PORTIONS OF THE TRAIL.2a. He met up with a Christian couple who gave credit to God for the strength to COMPLETE THE ENTIRE TRAIL and proceeded to mock them. Really? How about you do half of what they did and then mock please?"
1,A lovely book- but he spoilt it by being petty and intolerant,"At first a wonderful read, until page 250. The author is conversing with a christian couple. He asks them if theu have ever thought of quitting (the hike). Their response: ""we had a couple of low moments in the early phases but we put our faith in the lord and His will prevailed"" The wife adds ""Praise Jesus""Then the author writes:""I made a mental note to lock the door when I went to bed""Now what posessed him to make such needlessly unpleasant remark IN PRINT about a decent couple he met briefly. This book is going to be pitched in the trash."
2,yankeegetreal,"Well, lets see we have two clueless yankees that can not hike more than five to ten so called treacherous miles in March in Northern Georgia and Tennessee without of course (finding a hotel and resting a couple of days. And lets see everyone in the South is ignorant if they are not saving the behinds of these two moroons. Oh yes, walking ten miles and complaining. In mortal agony. Did not even know how to put up a single man tent. Scared to no end from black bears and wolves????from georgia????? Yes they made it 30 percent of the way, of course, half that was taken admittingly by a taxi cab. And yes, they are smart, and everyone from the South is like a idiot. Kinda of got a luagh out of it myself. Since I walk around my back yard- more than they did on this excursion. Thought I was getting a book about hiking the AT, what I got was a moaning book about how Iam out of shape and cant hack it and yes like people from the south is idoits. Didn't buy it. Didn't Finish it!"
4,Terrific must read for Americans: Conservationists or not,"I was so sad when this book ended because I had found a friend. Bryson has an ability to view and tell in a way that is spectacularly engaging and informative. I laughed out loud...a lot. On the communter train even, a crime in New York! I miss him now that the AP is over...tell him, finish the 100 miles in Maine. Get Katz, he needs it, you need it. A Fan"
3,Like Bill himself it faded as it wore on,"The first few chapters had me chuckling but as the book wore on I grew tired of the duo and when they ran out of trail so to speak I ran out of patience. Some nice insights, a bit too much ecospeak(some of it was indeed poignant though).In the end a nice idea but try and keep the laughs more evenly spread in future!"
5,"Great entertaining book, easy to read, can't put it down.","Great entertaining book, easy to read, can't put it down. I live near the AT but haven't been on it in years. But associated the places he explored with the places I have been to like the Smokies, Shenandoah, and Maine."
4,Humorous and informative. Down to earth!,"My wife and I enjoyed reading about Bill Bryson's experiences with his friend Katz. Their interaction is what makes this book so funny. We now feel better prepared for our own AT adventure and know what to expect out there. We could have done without the geography and history lessons, though."
3,"Lazy Hiker, Lazy Writer","Bryson wrote this book with the same dwindling committment with which he hiked the AT. Starting out with energy and wit, he gave up half-way through. Besides his hiking partner Katz, it is clear Bryson made little effort to meet and write about other hikers on the trail. Those he does describe, he finds as useful fodder for his sarcastic, occasionally mean-sprited satire.This book is funny in parts and is a fast read. But if your looking for a good guide to the AT, this is not it."
5,A must read for anyone wishing to discover america.,This book was a fantastic read. I to have explored the AT tosome extent in Tennessee and North Carolina and this book brought backmany great memories. Welcome back to America Bill and please finish the AT another day and by all means please write a follow up book regarding the AT !!!
1,A funny waste of time,"I don't know why everyone loves this book so much. The book was hilarious at times, granted, but the author doesn't come anywhere close to completing the trail, which is what it's supposed to be about, right? How can you rediscover America on the Appalachian Trail if you don't hike the Appalachian Trail to begin with? What idiocy!"
2,"walk in he woods, skim through the book","I started out really enjoying this book, the first half is pretty funny. The second part, not so much. Bryson contradicts his words with his actions. He berates the forestry dept.(often with good reason) but writes about his friend Katz leaving a trail of trash as they walk the trail. The part where he gives up and drives a portion is boring and negative. The second and last parts seem to be filler, making a longish short story in a book. The author didn't seem interested in finishing the book and frankly neither was I. Borrow it from the library and skim the last part."
2,what is wrong with america is people like byrson,"I enjoyed the book until about page 50 when he decided to abandon his quest of thru hiking and take the lazy 'city slicker' attitude of driving to spots and day hiking and trying to convince himself that he was fulfilling his goal. He cheated himself and he cheated his book by not truly hiking the trail.What is even more maddening is the fact that he has the audacity to make fun of people or point out their flaws of the hikers that start out to thru hike, but turn around after a few days or weeks. Bryson, here is a news flash...you are one of those people.Also, i really hope that bryson shared a portion of his profits with 'katz', because without his anecdotes the book would be absolutely miserable. when you decided to portion hike the trail it persuaded me to portion read your lousy book."
4,Not Unabridged and Bryson isnt Reading It,"Other reviews deal with the subject of this book at length, and I vaguely recall reviewing the book version myself years ago, so this is by way of a brief update. My husband and I checked this out of our library for a recent car trip. We have both read the book, and we both noticed things missing from this ""unabridged"" edition, despite its many cds. I'd like to know why it's billed as unabridged when it is definitely not. I'd also like to add that I wasn't crazy about the reader, but the reader isn't Bill Bryson, as so many other reviews seem to assume. Even with these flaws, the story is still a great one, although it definitely appeals more to those who aren't hard core hikers. Those of use who would never use ""unreasonable"" to describe a fear of bears or put ""only"" in front of a ten mile hike will enjoy this story of two men, no longer young, who dare."
2,Idealistic start with an abandoned goal - a metaphor for the unsuccessful hiker,"Read chapter one and was thoroughly engaged. I set out on the journey to read this book like an idealistic hiker approaching the AT. Found myself laughing out loud at Bryson's interaction with characters along the trail before reaching the Smokies and ""going off trail."". After that I feel as though the whole book lost it's purpose. Instead of intriguing interactions on the trail I got pop shot critiques of towns along the way. I get the feeling that Bryson only returned to the trail out of contractual obligation as his writing went from wanderlust to drudgery. The whole book is a metaphor for all those who start well and lose sight of their destination early on. I read the whole book. Didn't skip sections because they were less than expected. And like Bryson, when I reached the end of the journey I was relieved to get off the trail that he constructed. Disappointing."
3,Entertaining but too much political comment,This is a humorous book but periodically for many pages he author goes off into a rant about acid rain or global warming or some other ecelogical problem. Most of the adventure is pure fiction as anyone who has ever been a backpacker can readily see but still the book was entertaining if one overlooks the political comment and treats it as fiction.
5,Intelligent & Funny,"I love Bryson's wry self-depricating humor, his perspecacious wit, and amazing ability to bring me into his experience. This is a great summer read."
1,The author celebrates his own stupidity.,"If you set out, intentionally unprepared, to a place that you know is unpleasant or dangerous, and have a miserable time when you get there, then you are not entitled to whine about it!This book consists of snobbish, patronizing whining. ""Look at the funny natives"" interspersed with ""Gosh, this is hard. Guess I'll quit for a while and stay in a comfortable motel.""Bryson is on trademark form: self-indulgent and offensive. Don't waste your money."
2,How does that work?,"As an outdoors person I kept waiting for the triumph, the agony and the glory. Well it wasn't there. I am disappointed by a book about hiking the AT by someone who never hiked the AT. There was some nice background but that all came from research done in the library on on the net. After spending my life in the outdoors I have encountered plenty of humor but very little on this trip."
1,TWO FAT FAKE HIKERS,"I read this book as part of a Book Club - the selection was not made by me. I went in not knowing anything of this writer Bryson nor of the AT. I came out thinking what an incompetent writer and that the AT is probably a lot better than this whinger suggests.As for laughing out loud, I wonder at WHAT? Who would do this??? One reviewer answered this perfectly for me: Bryson is from Comedy Kindergarten.Give this book a PASS. Don't even bother to borrow it from your library. I'm sorry I wasted good Australian $$$ on this one."
1,It stinks !,Yes I have read the book and I don't think it was well written. The story is quiet simple and the language too basic. If you are looking for excitement this is not the book for you...
5,Great book...,This book was both entertaining and educational. Thought provoking throughout and 'laugh-out-loud' funny. There were parts that I couldn't wait to share with others as soon as I got through them. Great BOOK... a wonderful read!!
5,"Fun, Entertaining","This is a great getaway book that gives a fun, fast paced, and humorous account of hiking with a little knowledge sprinkled in. A nice escape from my everyday life at home in the 'burbs and at the office."
3,A bit amusing; not too accurate,"We bought this book on tape to listen to on our trip to the Shenandoah National Park (which we visit at least ten times a year). We heard Bryson's rant about the Big Meadows store not having trail mix, etc., five minutes after walking out of the store - and viewing the trail mix display, which has been there for years. Made me wonder whether he really went to all these places.Agree with him that the Shenandoah mountains are glorious; they really are. We never get tired of visiting. Knee problems keep me from going back on the AT now, but there are lots of other places to hike there, even if you can no longer handle the hills.And yes, there are lots of bears. We saw four this weekend."
3,"Entertaining at times, but could have been better","Well, perhaps I went in with too many expectations. The book was at times laugh out loud funny, but more often then that, it was a bit slow...it seemed like a regurgitation of the same story over and over. How many times need I read about his friend dumping gear because he couldn't handle the extra pound of weight? I found some of the idiotic things (like throwing out water and food) to not be as amusing as the author intended."
3,"fun at times, but...","I realized this book is for armchair travellers several pages into the book, so I give it three stars since it has funny stories and some background materials which are written in a humorous way. But I'd say the author is an utterly inexperienced hiker and it shows in the book. Not only did he have many ""adventures"" which could be easily avoided, but also he concentrated a lot on the discomfort of the hike/how many mileage he's done/people... Hiking is not about these, it's about seeing the beauty of nature! I hardly hear real hikers brag/whine about the hardship on the trail, they normally talk about how nice the view was, how bright the moon was, etc etc."
4,Good read,"As one who has not, nor expects to, walk the Appalachian Trail, I found this book to be a painless way of taking the trip. Bryson has a good voice, and better yet, a sense of humor. It kept me going without a break (usually I read two or three books at one time) and I was not looking at the last page to see how far I was from finishing it. Bryson is a good Iowa boy, and I will read more of his stuff. He's a keeper."
4,Bryson is excellent,"The book moves, is enlightening, funny, and educational. If you have ever walked in the woods, it might not look the same again!"
2,"Pop a beer and sit by the TV, Bill!","At first I wasn't going to read this book. I'm an avid hiker--having hiked the AT across New England--and it didn't seem like a hiker's book. But after many recommendations, I read it anyway and discovered my gut feeling was right: this is not a hiker's book. It's a couch potato's book. Sure, it's amusing in places and I enjoyed those sections; in other parts the guy is obviously having a miserable time...and so did I."
4,"Lite easy read, nothing to take seriously","This book has the perfect traits of a book one reads just to relax. I don't find it insulting as some others have, nor do I find it to be a work of art. It is just a good relaxing book about one regular guy's trip into the mountains. I would suggest it to anyone who likes to read for fun."
3,"A sometimes funny, ultimately disappointing read","As a sometimes hiker who has contemplated hiking the Trail, I purchased this book with the hope of being entertained, informed and inspired. I was entertained to some extent, and laughed out loud many times. But generally, I was disappointed with the book, as the second half of it seemed labored. For some light entertainment and a few laughs, this is fine. For anything else about hiking, the trail, the countryside, wildlife or the people who make the AT a draw for so many, don't bother."
4,SEX! SEX! and more SEX!,"Just to get your attention. Anyway, good story by Mr. Bryson. One msut admire a man who is willing to take on such a task just to write a book. Quite educational. It does lag near the middle and some of his rants about being environmental seem hypocritical due to the fact that he and Katz left a good deal of trash along the AT! Funny book though. Definitely reccomend it."
4,A delightful romp along the Appalachian trail,"Bill Bryson has again written a funny, erudite, informative book about one of his travel experiences. His previous works haven taken us to ""civilizations"" in Europe and small-town America; this book takes us through the anticipation, execution and aftermath of a personal odyssey by a 40-something, less-than-athletic writer who faces nature, companionship and bureaucracy along the way. In the course of the book, we learn the history of the trail and the geography of the areas it traverses, as well as learning about ""trail legends"", his fellow-hikers, and the ""locals"". He also raises thought-provoking points about the current and future status of the trail in this day of developers and budget cut-backs."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining,"This book was my introduction to Bill Bryson, and I'm sorry that I have missed him all these years. A Walk in the Woods is a real pleasure to read. The images Bryson conjures up of his hiking buddy's complaints and troubles on the trail, including tossing cans of spam into the woods to lighten his load, are hilarious. The best things about the book are that he doesn't hike the whole trail, he doesn't take himself too seriously about it and he leaves you with a realistic appreciation for not just hiking the AT but for hiking anywhere. READ IT AND ENJOY."
3,"A good read, but...","I enjoyed this book a good deal, but Bryson comes across a bit too arrogant for me. He spends an awful lot of time complaining about too many people in certain areas of the AT, and then chastises others for not enjoying nature. If we all had the time or resources to do what Mr. Bryson did, then his complaints would be better served. BUT, I did enjoy his book and must say I am jealous of his journey!"
3,Too Impatient to Get Southerners,"While I enjoyed the book and loved Katz, I couldn't help but notice that the author seems to hate the deep south, and loathes southerners, or thinks they are all just ""dumb"". I think he is too impatient to ""get"" the south, as is evidenced by the fact that he got in a car in Tennessee and drove to Virginia to get away from it."
2,Humorous yet offending,"I was really starting to enjoy this book until he came into the Smoky Mountain part of the trail. He described Gatlinburg Tennessee in a hillbilly manner. As everyone knows,because The Great Smoky Mountain National Park is the most visited place in America,this is not the case.He speaks of Eastern Tennessee as if he hiked the trail in the 1800's. It's funny how he found no problem insulting these people but did not like being questioned about the reasons he hiked the trail although he was a fat out of shape cry baby. (Sleeping in hotel rooms and eating at restaraunts) Well, I've given my 2 cents worth and can see that in this forum he has friends that rate the bad reviews as unhelpful. I see no reason that this will not change. Just remember Mr. Bryson, our ""smarts"" here in Eastern Tennessee may not be up to your standards but we never forget."
4,Great first half,"The first half of this book was really funny and I even laughed out loud at a few parts. The only problem was that it did get a bit tedious at sevral parts of the book. I am only twelve, but I read the the complete sherlock holmes when i was 8 and almost every main classic that you can think of ,so i think that ive had a fair exposure to literature. Because of that, I think that it is fair to say that some parts a re a bit stretched out.STILL WORTH THE READ!!!"
3,Family Read,My family is enjoying this book. I ordered to read myself and ended up reading it to my family in the evenings. Katz and Bryson's experiences on the trail bring us to laughter. The history explained in some places is fascinating and even leads us to look up facts and pictures. We are disappointed about the disparaging remarks about the habitants of Franklin and other areas of western North Carolina and most definitely appalled at the use of language. Even though the use of foul language may be common with hikers it has no place in writing. When reading aloud I had to pause to come up with another description to not bring discomfort to myself or my listeners. It would be great if there were another edition edited so all people could enjoy the adventures on the AT.
3,A Walk in th Woods/by BillBryson,"He starts his book in New Hampshire where he discovers a sign that states Appalachian Mountains. These mountains extend from Maine to Georgia. It covers 14 states and brings a great surprise to all who did not know that Appalchians covered so much territory. (It reminds me of finding out about the head waters of the Missouri River starting in the state of Montana.)The book has a few laughs,tell a few facts,and pulls you in.The book should be titled ""A stroll in the woods"" not a walk,since it does not go far on the Appalachian Trail nor does it go far enough in showing the riches or vast array of life that exists there."
4,Classic,"My grandkids loved it! Superb quality product, nicely priced, well packaged, arrived quicker than expected. Could not be happier. (word)"
2,Flimsy,"I don't like the way they make twister these days. The seller shipped it out on time, nothing bad about that. But its the actual product which is inferior. My son managed to break the dial the VERY same day that he got it. I've also seen this product for $10 dollars at a lot of stores and I not knowingly paid $20 dollars for it. So needless to say, I definitely would NOT recommend it."
4,oldie but a goodie,I was surprised when my kids wanted this toy. They like playing it and I'm sure you already know the game since it has been around for quite some time.
3,Old game is new again,"Just purchased another ""Twister"" game for the grandkids.It is still fun, but I do think that years ago, teenagers used this game for a fun and innocent (?) contact sport. How timeshave changed! The plastic is a bit slippery........butfalling down and tumbling over each other is part of the fun."
4,Twister-4 1/2 Stars,"Twister is a very nice, fun, calm game. If you have any sort of party with friends this is a great game to play. And it's not really any age limit, just as long as you know your right from your left."
4,"A more ""girly"" game, also age consuming",The main thing you need to make sure for is your balance and speed. Also it need spinning and determination. That's about it.
2,Even Classics Have Their Flaws,"My one complaint is the lack of spaces between the gamers.Everything else is quite nice for non active kids of this day, and age. Though I would recommend an open area to play. The bigger the better, and soft for falls.Carpets verse hardwood or title floors. If, playing, outside keep mat on a level surface. Avoid locations with tripping hazards, or little room to move."
3,This is a 0.3 Megapixel Camera,"Buy this if you want a cool-looking and very portable, digital camera that you'll use primarily outdoors to take low-quality, low-resolution pictures which you'll never print.As I write this, the product description says that it stores 400 ""high quality photos"" and that the pictures can be converted to ""1.3 Megapixel quality."" Both statements are dishonest. Philips itself never makes these claims in its documentation or on its website. While it can store 400 photos, this camera does not take ""high quality photos.""It takes VGA pictures, which is 640x480 (307,200 pixels, or 0.3 Megapixels). And while the included software can enlarge the photos (to 4 million pixels) and soften the pixelation, the quality is still that of a 0.3 Megapixel camera."
2,Just okay,"This is the cutest camera, but that is about it. The pictures are not very clear--lots of pixels. You can't take pictures in moderate light. You must not twitch or the picture will blur. The focus is off. The lens isn't dead center, so you have to adjust your position for a centered picture. The print out is low quality. But again, it is cute and very James Bond looking. It also works like a jump drive and you can transport files (word docs, pictures, etc.). I would have preferred to pay about half of what I did, but it will make a fun gadget on Christmas day and to keep in the car as the just-in-case-camera."
2,"Nice Idea, Bad Quality","This seemed great...portable and compact, recharges via the USB port. But the picture quality was way below sub-par and no flash makes it hard to take a good photo anywhere but in extremely direct light. Very disappointing, and with photophones coming down in price, it is not a streach to buy a camera-phone and get something more usefull. The only reason I gave it two stars was the looks and the size."
2,Oy,"If you want muzak, buy this cd. If you want the sound of water lapping against a sailboat, and wind in the sails, skip it. This series is a disappointment."
4,Scripted murder mystery kit,"This was my first murder mystery kit and hosted it with a friend. The introduction that came with the kit described the flow of the game but wasn't as specific as I'd hope for. As the game started, I thought the only clues that could be revealed were under the ""reveal"" section of the booklet for each round. By the time I got to the 3rd round, I felt a lot of information was missing and something just wasn't right. After looking carefully again at the introducation and all the materials, I realized I could conceal information if asked by other characters which were noted on the ""conceal"" section of the booklet for each round. This could of been clarified in the introduction book."
5,woodstock revisited,"This is definetly a period game. It was our fifth ""How to Host"" party and without a doubt our best. Costumes were easily obtained and elaborate and with music ranging from Ravi Shankar to the Beatles, the stage was set for this very funny and very plot twisting murder. No one guessed who the real murderer was and laughter dominated the the entire night!"
4,Fun but hard to win,"This was a hilarious game! It was however very difficult to solve, and would have required paying more attention (our group was having too much fun & everybody kept talking at once!) and taking notes. Not for kids (unless they're really hip) but lots of fun to dress up for too!"
1,Silly and Self Important,"I received this book as a gift, the author is a silly and pretentious clown, an intellectual lightweight who can neither write nor think. I remember seeing him hugging Mickey Mantle's coffin to try to get himself some kind of credibility in the game. He is worse than George Will. If you want writers who know about baseball and can write, try Bill James, Peter Gammons and Roger Kahn. This book and man are monuments to our semi-literate and shallow times."
2,Disappointing and Obvious,"In less than 200 pages (with very large margins) Costas says practically nothing. Salary cap, revenue sharing, yada, yada. At the end of the day we all know what SHOULD happen, but how can we MAKE it happen? If Bob takes up the mantle as baseball's next commisioner, I fully support it. But for now his book is a waste of paper. And please don't tell me how Pete Rose belongs in the Hall of Fame."
2,Costas Hook Slides Into the Bargin Bin,"That such a slim (and I mean that in both the physical and intellectual sense) volume could boast a retail price of $21 seems as implausible as the fact that Brady Anderson once hit 50 home in a season.Both feats are freakishly true.The book is essentially a collage of old ideas for improving the Grand Old Game largely by tinkering with its economics -- salary caps, revenue sharing and a smattering of other financial fixes. None of the ideas he forwards are bad. Nor are any of them uniquely his. If you are a baseball fan (and you'd have to be to even consider purchasing the book) there's probably very little here that you haven't heard elsewhere.If you are one of the legion of Costas fans and are determined to buy this book, follow the advice heard by forlorn Brooklyn Dodgers fans of the 1950s : Wait 'Til Next Year when it's reduced to bargin bin pricing."
2,Costas Should Stick to Broadcasting,"Although he makes many good points, a majority of the book is spent listening to Bob Costas whine about all the things wrong with baseball. I don't think the wild card is a great idea either, but I don't need to read an entire chapter devoted to hearing that with no solution. A quick, interesting read if you can get through the whining."
4,Great price for a good read.,"If you have no knowledge on how a manual transmission works or how to modify it, this is the perfect book for you."
3,Gear'd Up,"It wasn't what I had expected. The details are good to excellent for the 2 manuals featured, but I was after more on the ""Modify"" side of transmissions. This maybe more my problem, expecting more could be done with a tranny but none the less it covered the topic at hand with success. A good ""journal"""
3,Decent book that focuses on the principles,"I was looking for some info on how to rebuild a T-56 6spd transmission and this book came up in the search. It only mentions the T-56 a handful of times. Aside from that, the ""principles"" of rebuilding a transmission were covered very well. The only thing I would improve upon would be to add more picture diagrams of the labeled individual components."
1,Very poor quality,"Don't waste your money.Very poor quality. Doesn't help to cool very much.Difficult to refill.I tried using it for my bedroom which is pretty average sized, and my fan worked much better than this. Do not expect the cooler can cool your room in the summer."
1,Poor Quality,"Stool arrived in one piece however we ordered this unfinished stool to paint. As we simple started painting it the legs that were weak to begin with broke off as well as the horizontal spindles.Very disappointing, if I had not started painting it already I most definitely would have returned!"
4,Long awaited police memorabilia collectors price/I.D. guide,"First comprehensive price guide for this popular collectible. 192 pages of great pictures and information about badges, patches, vehicles, license plates, billy clubs and nightsticks, uniforms, restraints, call boxes and much more, even toys! Features 550 large, sharp, black and white photos, and 65 large, full color photos. Provides a brief history of badges and enforcement collectibles. A comprehensive listing of over 1,000 Hallmarks is included, with the maker's mark, location, years, city and state. Very interesting and useful book."
1,Item not as described,"I decided to purchase this item because I was looking for an inexpensive pump that came with a sports ball inflation needle. This item was described as ""Sport ball inflation needle stored in handle for easy access."" However, the item did not match the description. What I received was a ""Bell Airstrike Bike Pump"" (it didn't have ""1800"" on it) and it did not come with the sports ball inflation needle in the handle. I returned the item to Amazon."
1,Absolutely worthless,This pump is a complete waste of money. This model could barely inflate a basketball. I replaced it with the same brand but a different model which failed outright by bursting where the hose attaches to the base. The 1800 isn't worth the cost of the material it is made from.
1,Do Not Buy This Pump.,The adapter to fill presta valves (road bike tires) is poorly designed. After a frustrating 20 min. I could not get the adapter to seal tight and align correctly to fill even one tire. Will be returning this pump.
1,save your money/the hose got broken in a couple times...,"save your money/the hose got broken in just 4 0r 6 times...this pump is made with plastic is pretty bad,,pay a little more and maybe got something much better"
1,Terrible pump!,This pump filled my tires once... the rubber cracked and the air leaks out of the tube.What a disappointment!
1,This is the worst pump imaginable.,"Save your money. This product WILL NOT inflate your bicycle tires!!! This product is very deceptive because it looks like a bike pump and it is marketed as a bike pump, but it is in fact just a cheap hunk of plastic that will cost you ten dollars and a lot of frustration and never ever ever fill your bicycle tires with air."
1,piece of crap,"plastic, falls apart. I think someone else makes this and puts Bell's name on it, as no one in their right mind would put out such a piece of crap and want their name on it. It has to be someone who hates Bell who made this. I will never again buy a Bell product. I would have given it no stars, but they won't allow me to."
1,Nothing good about this pump,"My experience with this pump is down there with the worst of them. The hose cracked after a very short time. The valve inside the pump was not reliable from the beginning, and on the odd occasion that the pump did work, it was not easy to make a solid connection to the tire stem. Bell products, these days, are quite variable in quality. Some Bell stuff is good, other stuff isn't worth it at all."
4,Santo y las momias,"This is quite possibly the coolest film in existence. Masked wrestlers, zombies, kidnapping rings, evil cults, mad scientists...the list goes on! If you love b-movies, Mexican wrestling flicks, or cult films , this one is for you."
2,Badly written with little imagination,"Reading some of the former reviews I was looking forward to reading a great escapist novel. Well it was not. Writing style was not good, lots of logical faults ruined what seemed in the first place a good idea. The timeline is a mess, and the ending not that good. Want to read about man becomes woman, read The Sex Gates trilogy instead."
2,Sometimes you can judge a book by its cover.,"The cover should have tipped me off on this one. It looks like someone did it on photoshop with little thought behind it. The book is the same way. It starts off with a boy using some magic power, given by God or the devil, who turns himself into a model in a Walmart ad. The girl turns out to be some child model on her way to being famous. The problem here is Walmart uses no pro models in their ads. All the people are family of employees. The rest of the book is just as bad with unrealistic dialog, characters acting in ways no rational human would and a timeline that makes the whole thing just stupid."
4,"good hot reading, qualitative prose, and imaginative topics","flesh and the word 3 is an excellent book about all the different nuances and possibilities of gay sex and erotics. it combines stories of the realistic tradition with stories of a more experimentalist or postmodern type. the whole range of american contemporary fiction is in a way combined with passion, erotics and obsessions. anybody interested in reading and interested in sex between men, should absolutely possess this book."
4,"Flesh and the Word 3, solid buy.","As a good book that reaches a broad range of tastes in gay sex this is a good buy for the collector of anthologies. Some of the stories are wildly erotic and some are less that desiring, but overall the book contains quality stories.I strongly suggest it to an adventurer or the collector."
4,Erotic and hardly anything else,"But, you didn't click on this for the literary prose did you? Still, half the book I've read so far are very much well-written (though smut talk pops up quite often, but, like I said, you're probably not looking for a Noble Prize winner).The scenes are steamy and great, if you don't mind some of the more ridiculous lingo, haha."
3,"Works great, if you get the right bits","I have used one of these units happily for a year and just ordered a second. I often ride on a multi-user path right under high-tension power lines (can you say interference) and it soldiers along quite well. The one I just ordered came in sealed original Vetta packaging just like the first one, but the wireless receiver/handlebar mount is the wrong one. It is the receiver for the TX2 ""torpedo"" model that measures cadence, and it is incompatible with the VL110HR WL.I have emailed Vetta customer service to attempt to arrange an exchange. I will update this review once I get a response."
2,"No temperature, no HR","The heart rate function didn't work the first time I tried it. Also, this unit does not have any temperature functions, contrary to what is stated in the description here on Amazon.It does have a really nice light, though. I like the light."
3,Vetta Bicyle computer,This is a good product that I have used for several years. I found the Vetta people quite responsive to warranty claims and the computer does everything it says it does very well. The mileage is very accurate. My only negative observation is that the batteries have to be changed more than once per season in regular use.
5,Better than any prescription for asthma!,"I have all of the inhalers and prednisone...BUT, this is what helps an asthma attack. I really shouldn't be telling anyone. I couldn't get it at my local Vitamin Shoppe because I told too many people how amazing it was ....so, I had to order online. I ordered in bulk because I can NOT be without it. It is a MIRACLE!"
5,Perfect gift for an 10 year old granddaughter.,We have the original Mastermind and out grand daughter just loves to play it. She's 10 and very smart. She plays it with her Uncle (a MENSA member) and can win regularly. So we want to buy one for her to have at home.We are very please with the purchase and it came as advertised. New and the box never even opened.
5,Straightforward fun!,"This classic game has been around for decades, but it still provides good old-fashioned fun. No lights, no sound effects, just one player trying to stump another.One player hides a combination of four colored pegs in a particular order and the second player tries to guess it. The first player provides feedback about the guess and the first uses deductive reasoning to attempt to guess the pattern of pegs before they run out of guesses.This is a great game to play with children and allows parents to teach their children about the use of deductive logic.I adore games that provide fun while allowing children to learn while they go."
2,Really bad quality components,"Mastermind the game is a good game, but Pressman makes the worst quality components of any game manufacturer, and this game is no exception. The box is really flimsy and the colored pegs do not fit in the plastic container. Better to find an electronic version since it works better as a 1 player game."
4,Needs Tweaking,"I had the original version years ago, so when I saw the new one, I bought it for my grandson. He loves the game, but I gave it 4 stars because it's not as durable as the original, it's hard for big fingers to maneuver the pegs, and the colors are horrible. They're all pastels and the yellow, gold, and white are so similar it's hard to tell them apart in bad lighting. Still, a very fun game that teaches deductive reasoning."
3,Hate the newer version-Love the game!,"I just purchased this game for my kids as I remember loving it as a kid myself. The newer version is so flimsy, I don't enjoy playing it as much. The game itself is wonderful. I love that it helps my kids build their thinking skills. Love the game, hate the aweful quality of the new version and wish they had just kept the game as it was 30 years ago."
2,Poor design,"A poorly conceived design. The pieces do not fit inside the attached storage compartment. Buy someone else's design. Great game that teaches great logic...but why do we keep designing products that break, fall apart, do not store well, etc?!"
3,"Great game, cheap model","Mastermind is a great strategy game; my wife and I really enjoy playing it. Unfortunately, this particular model of the game is made very cheaply. The base was a very thin plastic that was warped upon arrival, but not unusable. The flimsy covers for the code and pegs feel like they will break very easily. The section to store all the pegs isn't even big enough to fit all the pegs in. Also, we aren't huge fans of the peg colors. These pegs are neon pink, neon orange, white, purple, yellow, and neon green. Not very easy on the eyes.Aside from the nitpicking on this being a very cheaply made product, the game is still very functional and we will enjoy the hours of use we can get out of it. It's a good purchase if you're just looking to get a good game to play between two friends or family members."
1,new and cheap version,"I had Mastermind as a child and loved it. For our wedding, we registered for this - the new version.The box is CHEAP - it will fall apart very easily. It is also way too big for what is included inside.The plastic board is also cheap, and the wall between the two types of pegs does not keep the pegs from mixing, so you end up picking the different pegs out of the other slot - time consuming! Plus, the trays are so poorly constructed that it is almost impossible to close the lid without getting pegs stuck so that it can't close.They should have just used the same construction as the old sets, and they'd have been much better off."
1,I used to love this game!,"I absolutely loved this game as a kid. Honestly the only disappointment I have with the one that was shipped to me is the fact that it's missing the red and white pegs.I understand sometimes things are missing (not Amazon's fault), and that wouldn't be too bad if when I contacted the manufacturer of the game if they'd ever gotten back to me.Love this game, hate the fact I have it and can't actually play it. I don't know where to purchase replacement parts as the manufacturer doesn't sell replacement pegs on their site. They're so easy to lose to begin with!"
2,"Cheap, flimsy thing.","The game concept is good, and I'd heard it was very fun, but this version is made on the cheap. Extremely lightweight and flimsy, the base doesn't feel like it would survive an accidental drop. I might get an older copy that is more substantial, but I do not recommend this game."
4,"Simple, inteligent and engaging","Deductive reasoning at its best. Awesome and absolutely brilliant. I got this for my 8 year old daughter and my hisband and I have taken turns to play with her, and we have been late for dinner many times--- not anting to get up till we finish the game. I recommend it highly for parents who want to spend some quality time with their kids."
2,There is a much better way to play Mastermind,"I loved this game as a kid, but I always had to play it when my Dad was available to be the pattern police. Now you can just play Mastermind solo on the computer or ipod, and get a new pattern and all your pattern clues without having to tie up someone else's time. I hate to encourage electronics over a real 3D toy, but in this case it absolutely makes sense. No parts to get lost that way, either."
1,Great game - poorly made,"I've been playing the Mastermind game as a kid and I liked it a lot. I was excited to offer the same to my children. However, this particular edition turned out to be very poorly made. The plastic is ugly and cheap - doesn't even have consistent color throughout the board. Some of the small pegs are too thick to put them into the holes, some other are loose, most are too hard to pull out for my kids. Colors of the big pegs are dull and are hard to distinguish from one another in ambient light.Returned to store."
4,"Great game, crappy packaging","I have always loved this game. I used to play Mastermind for hours with my siblings. Now, I have shared this game with my kids. We got this new version since my original game has been long lost. This version seems to have some design flaws though. The storage compartment is difficult to close and is always getting pegs stuck in the tiny holes on the side. I have given up using it and store the pieces in a separate bag. Also, it is hard for adult fingers to put pegs into the code maker section. Otherwise, it is a terrific game."
3,Always liked the game but design lacking,I remember playing this game when I was young so I had to get it for my kids.This particular model is made of fairly cheap plastic.The built-in storage container is a nice idea but this one doesn't close well. I can't imagine picking up 100s of pieces off the floor.The game is great but this model is not worth the price. I would have got a better model at a local store if I waited a bit longer.
2,NOPE!,"Contrary to advertising this shower head does not give strong flow at low pressures. It is a decent shower head, but only with a substantial amount of water pressure."
2,It leaks!,"Brand new - right out of the box and installation's a breeze but I can't get it to not leak. If I tighten it so tight that it won't leak, it's not adjustable. If I loosen it so it can move left-right etc., it leaks. What's a person to do?"
4,"The album that became ""Small Gods""","Swati ""Swati"" is the locally released version of the album that was later released as ""Small Gods"". Of ""Small Gods"", the artist says ""[It's the same cd [as ""Swati""] with the exception of one song replaced and one song being remixed."" The songs were also remastered and put in a different order for ""Small Gods"".If you are choosing between this edition or the edition released later as ""Small Gods"", I'd suggest getting ""Small Gods"" because it sounds much better and has a better song sequence.The song 'Into the Sun' is exclusive to ""Swati"" and the song 'MF' is exclusive to ""Small Gods"". 'MF' is an essential song in the catalogue, but 'Into the Sun' is not so much, at least not in this recording (it probably sounds better live).I'd give this version 4 stars, and ""Small Gods"" gets 5."
5,"Well, very cool collection","Amazing that Ginette Neveu is mentioned only casually in all of the reviews below. She DID beat David Oistrakh, the ""king of violinists"" at the Wieniawski violin competition. Her playing is of the top caliber.In any case, this disk is interesting as both a historical artifact and as a wonderful recording. It is a good sampling of Hassid's lush playing, but doesn't begin to cover Nevau's carrer. You can get her recordings elsewhere.Another brilliant violinist who died young, Michael Rabin."
2,A bit disappointing...,"my opinion mirrors another reviewer who said it was good until the teenage nigel shows up. he started out as an elitist little snot and i was hoping for a bit of maturity and understanding from nigel and his stepmother to come out as the film went on.i didn't know this was based on a true story until the end; even so, i still don't get why he was so mean to her. it's not like she really abused him in any way and she obviously loved his father very much. i can totally understand why she was that way to him because he was just a little sh*t to be around who obviously looked down on her from the very beginning.anyway, hbc totally rocked and nigel as a boy was well acted. just didn't care for the end and honestly if this is a true story, nigel slater doesn't come out in a very favourable light."
3,"Helena Bonham Carter never seen like this before, egad!","Parts of story are well told, Helena Bonham Carter is outrageous, making me laugh out loud several times, but in the long run the movie runs out of steam. We never find out why Helena, as Mrs. Potter the cleaning lady, can cook so divinely yet doesn't use those talents as a professional cook. She'd rather be a drudge and scrub floors? Really? Helena's character goes from being a swinging, smoking, amusing hussy of a housekeeper to a competitive and mean spirited step-mother, vying with a teenage boy for his father's attention by out-cooking him. That might be accurate based on Nigel Slater's life, but it doesn't make for an interesting movie. I thought all the actors were pretty good, it's great to not recognize most of them, and you have never, ever seen a fat, frowsy, fierce Helena Bonham Carter behaving like this ... it's mind-boggling."
2,Simplistic,"As it usually happens, we fell victims of a perfect trailer. Reasonably good acting, would have made a great short story for one of the morning shows."
5,Love this film!,"I loved this film in the theater and now I've shared it with friends who love it, too. Such a wonderful story situated smack dab in my youth when none of us knew how to get through and the grown-ups were no more adept than we were. And then there's the food. And Dusty Springfield. Wonderful."
2,Bonham Carter the only real reason to see this so-so drama ...,"Really love Freddie Highmore, and REALLY love Helena Bonham Carter ... but beyond Bonham Carter's terrific performance as Mrs. Potter, I just couldn't get into this film. Set in Britain in the late 1960s, this one's about a young boy named Nigel (played by Highmore, as an adult) who has always doted on his mother - whose cooking is so bad, her best meal is toast. Nigel grows to have a fascination with food and cooking, and when his mother dies from asthma and his father soon after starts dating the cleaning lady (Bonham Carter) - who can cook like a professional chef - Nigel takes up the gauntlet to out-do her. Highmore's performance here is so sterile and one-note, it's hard to even like the adult Nigel - perhaps the film's biggest weakness, and why I give this one only two stars."
2,Boring Book,"I just adopted a 5 year old deaf girl. I've had a hard time finding a book that she can relate to. I was hoping this book would focus more on being deaf, wearing hearing aids, showing the kids using ASL, what makes a deaf child/school different than a hearing one, etc. Instead it's a boring book about going to school, typing a letter on a computer, and learning to sign ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"". Boring, Boring, Boring! I am so happy that I only bought this one ""Moses"" book and I will be returning it tomorrow."
2,Doesn't Sound Like Haydn,"Hamelin play so fast that the ""feel of Haydn"" cannot be detected. When I first listened to this CD my thought was that Hamelin's playing was about Hamelin and not Haydn. If you want to hear Hamelin you'll probably like this. If you want to hear Haydn, your best bet is another recording.There is an old saying in golf that you ""drive for show and putt for doe"". Hamelin is playing for show. His own."
5,It is a great game for get togethers!,"Taboo is a fabulous game for young and old. It is a fun game to break the ice as it allows people to ""let their hair down.""By the way, they do put out refill cards. We own a set! END"
5,You'll laugh for hours,"This is the best game to play with your partner and a group of close friends. Once you learn how to communicate with each other, you realize how much you actually know about your relationship!It's just like $25,000 pyramid, only better!"
5,A total blast!,"My friends and I have a ""total blast"" playing this game. We are in our 50's and we have never laughed so much in our lives. I would highly recommend this game if you like to have a lot of joy and laughter in your life. I've even played it with my children, who are in their 30's, and they love it too."
4,can be fun depending on the group that it's played with,"taboo can be a fun game but the better you know the people you're playing with, the easier and more fun it will be. it has to be the right kind of group to play this game with."
5,There needs to be some refill cards!!,"I absolutely love the game, but we've played it so much that we know all of the cards by heart. I would love it if the company would come out with some refill packs of Taboo cards so we could continue playing the game!!!!"
5,Best Small Party Game Ever Tried,"My husband and I used to give small dinner parties (four guests and us) every week. We played Taboo at someone else's party and had so much fun, we decided we HAD to have it for our own. The wonderful thing about it is you can play with any number of people, the teams do not need to be even numbers, and it doesn't matter if you are best friends, or half your party has never met before. The game stimulates your brain and involves everyone. Even shy people find themselves yelling out answers and laughing at awkward explanations."
5,The best game to bring to any adult party.,"I bring Taboo out at all my parties. It's a great way to get a party rolling, something that both men & women enjoy. I bring it to every party I go to. The more players you have the more fun it is. Buyer beware, this game is addictive."
3,Fun only so many times,"This game is GREAT fun the first 4 or 5 times you play, however, after that, it is boring and looses it's appeal. You become able to guess the word on the card before the person even gives you a full description because you remember the words from previous games played. Unlike Monopoply or Scrabble that have a different outcome each time you play, Taboo becomes very repeatative and too predictable. We have come to use Taboo as a ""last resort"" game to play at our get togethers. I would recommend that you play the game, but not own it for yourself. It takes all the fun out of it."
3,Mild melting,"Another worthwhile release from the underrated exotic composer does suffer from thematic (itself easily enjoyable) repetition and extended ambiance, but still provides plenty of inspirational, engrossing notes for thought."
5,AUTHOR PETER TELEP IS GREAT !,Author Peter Telep made me more of a Descent Fan. By reading the Descent: Stealing Thunder I got more involved with the characters and the story line. Peter gives clear understanding in the world of Descent.
1,Don't Buy this book!,"This book is Awful....Its advice is not real helpful...more importantly many of its practise problems have mistakes (typos, answers C & E are identical, forgoten words etc.), its explanations are useless, and its answers are often wrong (They say things like: Answer is A. Statement I allows you to eliminate choices A & B. Statement II allows you to eliminated C & D. Answer is A.)Buy the Kaplan book, by the official guide, download Powerprep....if you want more problems maybe buy Princeton Review...but NOT THIS BOOK!"
5,MUST READ,"I was searching for a book that had edge of your seat suspense and thriller action, and this book delivers on every level of entertainment. If you are reading this and are searching for a book that will keep you turning the pages, you have found it."
4,Home Alone for adults,Dave Elliott is an adult version of Kevin in Home Alone whois after all of the bad guys who are trying to kill him forreasons unknown. The backdrop is a fifty-story building justperfect for all of his adult booby-traps. Could there bea Vertical Run 2 in the future?
4,What a knockout!!!!!,"I read this book for a book report and I couldn't put it down! This guy goes to work and is wanted dead by everyone he knows, I mean suspense dosen't get any better then this!!!! If you have enough free time, pick up a copy of this, because you won't be marking the pages!!!!!"
5,One good book.,"Couldn't put it down.Just as good as ""Thirteen Mountain""by John R.Reed.As a matter of fact I think Garber & Reed are two of the best action writers of today.Hope Dave Elliot returns."
4,The movie should be fantastic,"A thoroughly enjoyable book, if somewhat of a cliche. The story is thrilling, but I found the flashbacks to be not very creative; it's been done thousands of times already! Still, the story is intriguing and much more compelling than most thrillers. Just hope the movie isn't merely a knockoff of Die Hard."
4,Different but good,Good story with continuous action...............Kinda wierd but hides the secret well until the end.........Still somewhat mysterious at the conclusion.............Worth your time..........
2,"uh, what's so great about this book??","I was surprised at the number of good reviews that this book had. I found it to be silly for a number of reasons. The whole plot itself, for instance. The silly dialoge, and silly characters are another problem. And what's with these stupid Vietnam flashbacks? This story couldn't beat Die Hard if tried."
2,"A total ripoff - fast paced, but unoriginal","This is a total rip-off of three stories all rolled into one lame, predictable story. Die Hard: He's a hero with marital trouble getting hunted through a sky scraper setting traps and shooting people. Outbreak / The Hot Zone: He's been infected with a mutating, airborne virus that will kill everyone on earth. Jacob's Ladder: He was given a mind-bending drug in Vietnam that makes him extremely paranoid."
2,"Too Many Climax's, and a shaky story line.","The book is like a bad action movie, with no story line, and very doubtful stunts. I laughed at how fake the story was, and how unintelligent the enemies where."
5,WOW,I have been looking for this book for a long time. Not only did it arrive in a timely fashion but in pristine condition to boot. for only a penny. YOU ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A+++++++++++++++++
4,Fast paced action,"In a manner not unlike the young Australian author, Matthew Reilly, Garber has set out to write an action novel which doesn't let up. Well, Ok, it would let up for a paragraph here or there... The story is largely set in a high rise building in New York but what initially keeps you turning pages is how absolutely everyone seems to have turned against the our hero - The enormous ""Why?"" combined with non stop action means its about half way through the book before you can even pause (to go to sleep?) before resuming and galloping to the finale.Although I felt the story unfolded in a standard non-stop 'action' way, comparable to the moronic bits of fluff Hollywood calles 'blockbuster movies' nowadays, I was impressed with plot - it was quite rich without stepping into the unbelievable until the final page (yes folks, don't read the epilogue...). Its a cracking read so if you are feeling like some 'blockbuster' reading, you can't go far wrong with this book!"
2,Written to be a movie?,"This book felt like it was written to be made into an action movie--plenty of stunts, gruesome events, running running up and down, climbing outside the building, implausible events, questions to be answered at the end. I found it uninteresting."
2,Uninspiring paranoid fantasy,"Joseph Garber's ""Vertical Run"" was a mindless supposed action thriller that fortunately was a very easy read. The plot was a pale and predictable rehash of more polished examples of this genre.47 year old Dave Elliot is a high ranking executive of the Senterex corporation, a successful conglomerate, with offices on the 45th floor of a New York skyscraper. Elliot, a former Green Beret that served in Vietnam, while at work, without warning inexplicably becomes the target of all those he comes in contact with. This bewildering cat and mouse game commences when his boss, owner of Senterex, the pudgy Bernie Levy pulls a loaded gun on Elliot. In short order Elliot discovers that a large mercenary team has been dispatched to find and execute him. Elliot, as expected, uses all his military guile and cunning to evade his pursuers and determine why he has been targeted.Garber certainly did not come close to enticing me to pick up any of his other work."
2,Completely absurd.,What happened in this book would never happen in real life. It was wrong on so many different levels. If you can completely suspend your disbelief perhaps you will like this book. There is a lot of action and the story keeps moving.
4,A terrific read,"Ordinary businessman and Vietnam vet David Elliot goes to work to discover everybody wants to kill him for no apparent reason. He must use his military training to fight for his life and uncover the truth. You can call it Rambo in a Die Hard situation. Despite its fairly weak ending, Vertical Run is fast-paced, exciting, and fun. I highly recommend it."
4,"VERY WELL DONE BOOK, I WAS IMPRESSED!","Excellent book. Tons of action, great detail and description. There were very few parts I was critical of. Overall, it was outstanding. I highly recommend this book to all those who love the action/adventure, special forces/green beret type novels."
3,"Great concept, adequate execution","The concept behind Vertical Run is ingenious, and sets up a tense and dramatic initial situation. However, once the reasons behind that situation have to be explained, the book's momentum can no longer carry the story smoothly over the potholes in the plot. In addition, the hero's method of finally dealing with the lead villain is so ludicrous and out-of-character as to be funny, which is not at all in keeping with the rest of the book. (And I can virtually guarantee you that it will be changed if the movie is ever made, as I can't see any of Hollywood's romantic leading men agreeing to a script involving such a scene.)It's not a bad book, but the excellent concept deserves a better one."
4,action packed and high tension,"This book was a great action packed novel. I saw in the one reveiw that the rights were already picked up to be a movie...I'm not surprised. Can you say , Bruce Willis? It was very much a Die Hard kind of action and suspense book and the actual sequence that the title refers to was absolutely brilliant. I got a flashback of McGuyver during the stairwell scene....it was inguineous. The pace kept up through the whole book and had a beleiveable plot. It kept you guessing what was real and what wasn't throughout. The way it was written gave insight into the main characters mind and levied a little humor at his expense. It was refreshing to read a book that kept you both interested and chuckling. I definetly would recommend it to all my action fan friends."
2,An author should write about something he knows.,"Mr. Garber appears to have watched a re-run of Die Hard and tried to write a variation. He failed. He knows nothing of a combat veterns thoght process, emotional makeup or civilian adjustments yet attempts them all in a Zane Gray style. The ""green beret, badest of the bad"" now top corporate executive and favored by all comes head to head against his ex-Nam compatriots, now set on killing him. They convince his boss to try first. Mid 60's, fat and emotional ... who is this succesfull corporate take-over guy? Who then, in a burst of self pity committs suicide. Now a team of around fifty (50?!!!) hardened killers fill a downtown NY office bldg and begin leaving dead bodies everywhere. Of course the family, friends and press all agree that our hero is just a ""Nam syndrom freak"". No problem."
5,An action classic,"One of the bestn thrillers I have ever read! I borrowed this from a friend originally, then had to go out and buy my own copy! Fluid writing, fast-paced action sequences and a main charcter you can identify with. Dave Elliot wakes up one day and finds his well-ordered life (job, wife,e tc.) turned upside down as his boss pulls a gun on him and he's trapped in his office building with people who want to kill him! Don't start this unless youre prepared to finish it! Highly recommended!"
4,Good read!!,"I have just put this book down after a marathon reading session. WOW. If you like action type books, get this. If Steven Seagal doesn't get the film rights to this book, there is no justice in the world, the part of Dave Elliot is perfect for him. Get the book, a bloody good read"
1,Awful. Just plain awful.,"Ok... for all potential readers of this book, allow me to offer you a scene directly from the text (in my own words of course). Our hero has managed to get his hands on one of his enemies' two way radios. When the enemy realizes that our hero has been listening, he offers our hero a chance to speak his mind. Our hero takes this opportunity to address his foe, and do you know what our author has the hero say to the man who is trying to kill him? ""Up your poop with an ice cream scoop."" That, my friends, is what you can expect from this piece of crap. Ignore the five star ratings. This book sucks."
2,fast-paced thriller lacking substance,"A quick read if you don't mind a lack of characterization and richness in plot. I had this around a 3.5 star rating halfway through the book...however, it never did turn the corner and take it to the level I thought it could've reached. I may be considered picky, but I like good character development and a plot with good context and I found this novel lacking in both. However, I did read just about the entire book so it did enough for me to get through it for the most part. I lost interest in the character and plot 3 quarters of the way through, though."
3,Its a pretty good book,"It's a pulse pounding story that has a strong plot, there is no real theme and there is no character development outside the protagonist. Overall the book is not boring so i would recommend reading it."
1,Die Hard revisited?!?!?!,"When a high profile movie such as Die Hard comes out, about terrorist taking over a skyscraper, and the author; Joseph Garber comes up with story about a man trapped in a building with terrorists types what's the big deal? That's not original. Anyone can take a movie change it a little and take credit as original. Give me a break, write about something original and stay away from high profile movies. What's next the hero Dave Elliott will land on a train and the same bad guys will trap him there!?!?!"
2,Mediocre writing,"I'm a huge fan of Stephen Hunter and James Garber was recommended to me as an author who is a close second to Mr. Hunter--WRONG. This book has an extremely linear plot, ridiculously one-dimensional characters, and absurd stilted dialog. I couldn't believe how silly some of the characters sounded. Scott Thatcher talks like a cartoon character. David's wife is a horror that makes you wonder what he was thinking to hook up with her in the first place. Ransome is supposed to be an intimidating villain but is just predictable and boring. There are no surprises in the plot. This is the second book I've read by Mr. Garber--there won't be a third."
5,SanDisk What Else Needs To BE Said,"I am a huge believer in SanDisk products. This card did not disappoint. I use it in my Canon 7D and 1D MarkIV camera bodies without any problems. Being a wildlife photographer I need a compact flash card that is fast and this card works for me. I do not like putting ""all my eggs in one basket"" so I don't use the larger cards like the 32gb, 64gb, etc. cards. Two thumbs up for this card."
3,Check camera compatibility!!!,"It's great to have a card of this capacity, however, be sure that your camera is compatible with it. I have a Canon EOS 5D and the camera will only take an 8 GB card or less!!! Not a lot for 13 megapixels if you're shooting in RAW. Go to the SanDisk website and you will be able to see if your camera will support this card. I've been extremely happy with past SanDisk products and I'm sure this card is fantastic in the right equipment... When I first put the card into the camera, it showed it would shoot 977 RAW images, but as soon as the card was formatted, it wouldn't shoot more than 499 images and the available space on the card was indicating that it was an 8 GB card. Very disappointing, but again, not the fault of SanDisk. I called Canon and, presently, there is no ""fix"" for this."
2,Not so great,"Nothing to do with the seller, who was very prompt. Card works fine, but I get the impression that it is actually slower, substantially so, than the Ultra II card I replaced. There is a noticeable pause while the camera writes the image to the card. The Ultra II card had a slight delay as well, but nothing long as this one. Of course, I am using an older camera which was not designed to use a high capacity card like this, but I can't believe the delay is because of that. My impressions are based on a week-long session with the card and over 500 snaps. I would seriously consider using a camera that uses an SD card instead, seeing as to how the other camera we use does not have a noticeable delay using the SD Ultra II card by Sandisk."
4,"What, are you kidding me?","First review?Well, this was one of those bands that you remember through a fog of booze and smoke, and swear was the best thing you had *ever* heard. Alt-country wasn't even a word yet, and the first time I heard them I didn't know what to think of the funkified rockin' country twang just killing the room in front of me.Then Again is the cleanest representation available (only?) of that music, and still gets regular rotations in my player next to Son Volt, Wilco, Damnations, Freakwater, Jayhawks and Tom Waits."
5,Can't beat the price,"Came on time,as good as the ones twice the price at parts stores perfect fit easy to install with right tools would recommend great find."
2,eh....,"Its funny I guess but after the first 2 episodes you've pretty much seen them all. There also isn't captioning, something that i look for in movies, especially in things like this because the audio isn't great. Its a funny show but I think for the time and money I'd rather watch AFV"
4,Scare Tactics is Scare Funny,"I always loved hidden camera shows from Candid Camera to Punk'd, but this stuff hosted by the hilarious Tracey Morgan is just too funny for words. I laughed out loud so many times i can't keep track.You should check this dvd set out for your own viewing, just silly good."
3,Entertaining,This is pretty funny. The junkyard and Satan's baby clips are pretty good. I've seen a couple episodes in the past but this one makes me want to check out more.I'd buy it again.
3,They're ok,"The characters are a little small. I did read the size,, but they still seem smaller than I was expecting. They are a thin coated cardboard. I used them to as decorations for my sons first (dr suess) birthday party.. and I probably could have not bought them and it wouldn't have made much impact on the party."
2,Looks nice but...,This bat looks very nice and solid. Pretty much like a leather cricket bat. That's where the good things end. It's way too heavy to be a softball cricket bat and a bit overpriced as well. I play heavy tennis ball cricket and this bat has been a headache. I tried playing with it since I did invest a bit of money in to it. But it's too heavy and my fav. shot being the pull shot.. I still got hit in the chest more times than when I played with the average softball cricket bat. The bat speed you can generate is pretty slow unless you got matty hayden forearms. The handle is a bit smaller than other bats too.
2,Disappointing fit and finish,"The bat has a nice heft to it, but I was very disappointed in the finish. The wood is only sanded smooth and not sealed or finishd in anyway. The biggest detractor is that the sticker decals were applied in a poor fashion with multiple wrinkles in the decals. My 8 year old could have done a better job. I would not have purchased this product had I known about the poor quality of the finished product."
3,The bat is not finished very well..,"Pro: Structurally, it's a sound bat, a bit heavy though and the shipping was fairly quick from the seller.Cons: There was mold inside the plastic wrapper of the bat and on the surface of the wood. I'm assuming the warehousing/shipping of the product is pretty dank for this to occur. The bat was not sealed in any manner. The decals are not applied properly."
4,Possibly the greatest achievement in modern day equipment manufacturing,"All I needed was a cheap replica cricket bat for my Halloween costume (Shaun of the Dead), and Reebok delivered in full. It feels and looks like the real thing, and I am in love... I haven't actually played serious cricket with it, but I can tell you if looks are what your going for, buy it!"
4,a few issues after 2 years,"This has worked perfectly for about two years.Recently it has flickered when plugging it in or not showed the picture on the TV a few times.When I stepped on the cable while going to unplug it, it started working again.Since then it's worked great.For the price, I'd buy another one."
5,Works just fine,I use it to connect my computer to a 720P projector and I've never noticed any problems with the connection.
4,"Beautiful watch, reasonable price","I have not yet worn the watch. It is a Christmas gift my wife is giving me. I played with it a bit before it got wrapped. I think it is beautiful. I have not had an automatic watch in years, and I own over 20 watches, so I may have to buy a winder. Anxious to wear it on a daily basis."
2,"Boring, yet not bad enough to stop in the middle of it.","Jane could have been interesting, but her obsession with Darwin and his travels and theories actually controls this book. Martha does not come through at all as a character. The only thing that pulls you through the numerous discourses on species is the need to know the family ""secret""."
3,2 stories that should have been 1,"The title and setting of this story is what attracted me to read it. But once the underlying story began, of Jane's childhood, I wished that the entire novel had been on that topic. I enjoyed the lush scenery, and the descriptions of the Galapogos, which is what made me choose this book in the first place, but I think the two plots would have been better had they been separate. And to be honest, the flashback sequences were what I enjoyed most. There was too much of a gap in between stories. One minute-- Jane is 14, then she is 25. On the whole, I enjoyed the book, it was a great summer vacation read, and a fast one, but I was looking for more. Intertwining the two stories into one meant leaving out details. This was the only disappointment. Read it and I think you'll agree."
1,A Mirthless Disappointment,"""Evolution of Jane"" was a tremendous letdown, a short story inflated to book length. Besides lacking any of the wit of Schine's earlier books, the plodding narrative reads more like an essay with occasional illustrations than a novel. Jane (far and away the story's least interesting character) revels in a narcissism so unbearable that Schine's superficial asides on Darwin are easier to swallow than Jane's agonizing over lost friendship. And the heroine's ""evolution"" doesn't begin until a page or two before the end, making for a quite unbelievable revolution. To paraphrase a character from one of Woody Allen's middle-period films, ""We liked your earlier, funny books better."""
2,"Not very deep, a bit contrived, but didn't bore me","Most of the reviews hereunder were very negative, one reader even cringed at the thought of actually finishing this book. I didn't think it was that bad, it was entertaining enough to make a West/East coast flight go by quickly. But it was nothing brilliant. And I don't recommend it (there are too many wonderful books out there to waste time on one that is only so-so)."
1,"Buy the ""Origin of the Species"" in the original .","It,s fascinating to read the variety of reviews-everthing from ""I hate it"" to ""I love it."" Afraid I'm on the dislike continuum. I bought the book because I heard Cathleen Schine speak and thought she was witty and charming.Was I disappointed. I thought the characters uninteresting and boring (glad I wasn't on that trip,) and the stuff on Darwin didactic and boring.If I wanted to know about evolution I'd go to Darwin direct andIf I wanted to know about lost friendship I think I'd search the Internet. ButI will read Rameau's Niece(great title) to see if I'm being too harsh."
4,Wanted to read more about the dissolution of friendship.,"I liked this book about Darwin's ideas and how they relate to human relationships. I loved the way Shine played with the meaning of ""species"" which emphasizes the notion that our categorizations are somewhat arbitrary, and often, overlapping. I liked the descriptions of the Galapagos Islands and their flora and fauna. However, the theme of lost friendships, especially during teenage years, is really worth a much deeper treatment than we can get here. I do not feel that Jane is being narcissistic but she that she has suffered from the abandonment of her childhood friend and still does not understand the reasons for it. I think that the bonds between friends at that age are important to our interpretation of other relationships later in life and contribute to our self-image as a social being. I really liked the book but I wish this theme were explored more fully. I found Martha to be a ""flat"" character and hard to understand."
2,But Jane doesn't evolve at all,"The book was very well written, and the descriptions were wonderfully done. However, the characters are so shallow and so unlikeable I could only finish it in hopes that something awful would happen to them, especially Jane. I was drawn to this book having both lost a childhood best friend to unknown circumstances and being a student of evolutionary science,so it seemed to be a perfect fit. Unfortunately, it was not. But perhaps it is just a testament to the talent of the author that she was able to make such a strong characterization of Jane as to repel me. I just wish there had been more of a meaning to the story and to Jane's life."
1,"boring, disappointing and unlikeable","My entire book club was disappointed in the book. The idea was terrific, but the author failed to flesh out the characters and the plot. Even once the reader uncovers the secrets of Jane's family, who cares??? There are too many analogies and it feels like the author ran out of things to say after page 10."
4,provocative and quite interesting....deeper than most!,"I'm quite surprised by the number of negative reviews of this book, but I quite frankly found it very interesting. Jane, who is recently divorced, goes on a trip to the Galapagos where she finds that the tour guide is her distant cousin/estranged best friend from childhood. What follows is a convoluted tale of relationships, the evolution of friendship, species and families. For those who have developed a blind-sided aversion to Darwin and the theory of evolution, this is probably too much to take, but for those who enjoy the process of scientific thought and analysis and spoofs thereof, this book is a treat. But then, as a scientist by choice and vocation, I'm probably biased (grin)."
3,The Evolution of Jane is slow & sure.,"As something to do to get over her divorce Jane sets sails for the Galapagos Islands on a tour, where she finds her erstwhile best friend, rekindles her passion for botany, new friends & has an epiphany about her life. Jane is a reader, observant of life around her. Unfortunately she has little humor still, this was a strange & different read, filled with absorbing details about the person who penned the works that did & still does cause major tectonic shifts in the ways we think about ourselves, our lives & all living things. I relished gleaning so much about Darwin & the momentous ideas for which he is now an icon. END"
2,don't know why just didnt like it,just was not the kind of book i read.I really tried just could not get into it i could not even finish reading it.
2,It is why I live in the Northeast,"The word ""relax"" does not belong on this CD. The sound of a rattlesnake hissing and shaking its tail is not my idea of peace and RELAXing. Good for keeping rodents away maybe. The wind was ok but did not leave it on long enough to really hear it that well. If you like the sounds of dangerous reptiles lurking about while you rest then get this CD. Good thing scorpions don't make noise. They would have put them on here too."
5,Bose Speaker Wire Adapter - Perfect for the Acoustimass,Got this within days of ordering and installed it in the drywall. It was easy to wire the speaker wires on the back of the unit and it works great for the Bose 5.1 system I purchased.
4,A superior thriller!,The first thing that strikes the reader is the quality of Cannell's research into China which afforded him a very natural environment for his characters and his plot.One minor complaint:Wheeler Cassidy's persona could have used a stronger touch of the dramatic.
3,Relationship could have used more development.,"I thought ""Riding the Snake"" was interesting in its telling of the slimy underbelly of international politics, but it got a bit too technical with the descriptions of weapons. Another problem was that the relationship between Wheeler and Tanisha was not developed enough. How weird is it that Tanisha would hate him one day and like him a few weeks later? Wheeler's mother was a real @#*$!. When she called Tanisha ""one sadly confused little Negra,"" (or something like that) I wanted to scream! If I were Tanisha, I would have kicked Mrs. Cassidy in her prim and proper mouth! Anyway, I would like to have seen Wheeler and Tanisha get married. Of course, being that Wheeler has only had three unsuccessful years of college, I'd like to see what kind of job he will get. Maybe the former Prankmeister will open a novelty store where the main products will be joke-related items."

2,A disappointment after King Con,Characters were one dimensional and plot was ridiculous. King Con was a great read. This was boring.
2,Needs technical guidance,"This is a fairly well-written and somewhat interesting novel, but it suffers greatly on the technical side. The author should consult someone with firearms expertise before publishing his next novel. It's hard to maintain an interest in a book when details don't ring true."
2,Some improvement,"There is a real novelty in this book: for the first time ever in Cannel's cosmology, a Latino character (Ramón) is not directly associated with crime, dirt and grease altogether. Well ... he is an illegal immigrant, but hey!, you can't have it all."
4,Pretty Good,"This is my first Cannell ""book"" although I have watched and enjoyed many of his TV shows. I am a very eclectic reader and am hardly ever without a book at hand -- I thought Ride the Snake was a pretty good story line. It would do well as a made-for-TV movie or even a big screen. Like one of the other reviewers I would like to see a sequel. I really liked the change in Wheeler and to hell with his mother and her money! I think he made the right choice. Good quick read."
3,Okay story that could have been great.,"This story moved along at an exciting pace and the two lead characters were likeable. Still, I found myself disappointed by how quickly Wheeler Cassidy and Tanisha Williams overcame their cultural differences and conquered their own personal demons. For me, this lack of character development made ""Riding the Snake"" just an okay story that had the potential to be great."
5,The wisdom of our mothers and grandmothers,"At last, some down-to-earth, straight talking advice for women in real life marriages! This book is wise and witty, and packed with useful information and good stories. People who bitterly object to the ideas of the book may not have read very far beyond the title. Read Judge Judy's intro at the very least, critics. We all have the right to provide for our future and that of our children."
1,Don't purchase this product,"These blades feel like they are USED and repackaged. They are very disappointing, I am going to consider the purchase a loss and never go back."
1,Wrong Item,"I paid for the one day air service and it came in two days instead of one, then its the wrong item... the grill on da picture doesnt matches the grill i recieved."
3,"""Ultimate"" is a misnomer","this is definitely not the best single-disc survey of Merle Haggard's career by a long shot, since it barely touches his greatest 60s/early 70s Capitol recordings nor his popular 80s Epic singles, but instead dwells on his late 70s MCA songs...to date, by far the greatest single Merle Haggard purchase is the ""Down the Road"" box set, and it is the only one that adequately covers his entire multi-label career"
5,Best Sound,"What really distinguishes this from other Hag CDs is the sound quality. The detailed sonics enable you to hear each instrument in the band clearly (and what a good band he always had). And Merle's wonderful voice comes through better than any of the Merle albums I've heard. I refer to this CD as ""my country music collection"", since I don't often listen to any other artist in the genre. 'Cuz it's got more soul than ""soul music""."
2,A nightmare of false assumptions,"I have been a user of Microsoft Money for a number of years, and have finally decided to return to Quicken after spending countless hours (on more than one occasion) debugging bizarre issues and unwinding transactions that Money has decided (often mysteriously) to name or categorize FOR me. I spent three days tracking down a vendor who had apparently charged me $490 over the course of a month only to discover that the transactions were normal ATM withdrawals that Money had just decided to import from the online bank as being from that particular vendor. As a small business owner, that sort of stuff is just way too scary to tolerate in any software package. Stay away unless you are a super-basic user, or super, super advanced and willing to deal with it."
1,MAJOR CODE ERROR IN LIFETIME PLANNER,"BUYER BEWARE!I spoke with 3 Microsoft support technicians and never did get a resolution to a major problem with the Planner section. When attempting to prepare a phased Retirement Plan, the program apparently has a mind of its own and would insert its own version of retirement $ inflows in downstream years. I stepped through the program with various technicians so they could see that the program really does spontaneously insert its own versions of retirement $ inflows. The support technicians seemed to recognize the problem, but offered no resolutions.From my point-of-view, the program code/algorithms are unreliable and not to be trusted. What internal miscalculations are happening in other sections of the program? I plan to dispose of this program and purchase an alternative."
1,Quicken owners beware,"I bought the current 2003 version and previously the 2001 version in hopes of getting a new perspective. I have used Quicken since it's begining and was looking for a change. In neither version of microsoft could I convert my quicken files. In fact the 2003 version locks up my computer whenever I try to convert. I have followed the instructions and could get no help from Microsoft. I again resorted to upgrade my Quicken software and I'm giving up on MS Money forever. Twice bitten, etc."
2,MS Money 2003 - Don't bother,"I bought this program as a replacement for an ageing version of Quicken, but I am beginning to wish I had not bothered. I have had corruptions in which I had to export all transactions from all accounts, create a new file, then re-import. Just lately though, Money keeps dropping transactions or adding its own. The result is that what Money says I have is completely different to what my online bank statement says I have. This happens even after I have reconciled against my latest statement. The reconciled balance changes completely and I have to back track to find what transactions Money has dropped or added, and all this when I have set it up to automatically download transactions from my banks online banking facility."
2,Online quotes just stopped working,"After using Money 2003 for a year the online stock quote update function just stopped working. No warnings, no message, no nothing. After searching the web and reading the fine print I discovered that it will stop working 1 year from the date of registration or first use. Typical MS tactics. I am going to pick up a copy of Quicken."
3,Warning for Pocket PC 2000 users!,"I use Money in conjunction with my Casio Pocket PC and was more than happy to upgrade to the newer, faster, stronger version of Money which I do yearly. One problem: the Pocket PC version of Money 2003 only works with Pocket PC 2002 users! Bummer! This won't matter to 90% of you out there, but for those of us still using older pocket PC's, this is very important information. Either stick with an older version or shell out some big bucks to upgrade your Pocket PC."
1,Regretful Switcher,I switched from Quicken to Money this year. The [money]I saved is not worth it AT ALL. I have had nothing but problems since - bugs and errors. I am switching back regardless of the price.My advice: stay with Quicken and don't look back!
3,"Useful software, has its downsides.","After using Money for some years (previously Money 99 FS) upgraded to 2003 Deluxe. It would not read my previous money file saying it was corrupted. After countless hours with support (they did continuously keep me updated) they said the upgrade was not supported. They even looked at my 99 file and couldnt find a reason why it wouldn't read in 2003. Anyways, I did the upgrade the hard way - export/import. Currently everything seems to work good.One botheration which another reviewer pointed out is that the shares purchased should be rounded to 3 decimal places instead of six. It always messes up the sale if you have partial purchases like DRIP etc."
2,Money 2003 is a disaster,"Money 2002 had problems, but 2003 is far worse. The initial install refused to use the Money 2002 backups, or archival files. Worse yet, when we deleted 2003 and reinstalled 2002, we found that 2003 had corrupted all of our backup files, and none of the 2002 backups (5 of them) could be read. As usual, Microsoft support was useless... they said what we already knew.... Yes thats a known bug, and you'll have to recreate everything from the beginning. Big help. Stay far away from Money!"
1,Beware - MS Money 2003 Expires after one year!,"Please read the EULA (end user license agreement). Microsoft, in their usual sneaky fashion, have inserted a new clause that makes certain online update features expire after a certain period of time forcing you to purchase the next version of this software in 2004."
4,A Big Performance Gain Over Money 2002,"My favorite version of Money to date has been 2000. It had a clean user interface with lots of useful features that didn't seem to go overboard. Subsequent releases of Money have been plagued with ""featuritis"", as the war with Quicken continues. Money 2002 is by far the worst victim of this disease. Microsoft added so many new features with little concern for their cost on performance. It got so bad that entering and editing data become almost as slow as handwriting it in a checkbook and using an abacus to calculate the results.Finally, with Money 2003, Microsoft has begun to marry features with performance that returns to the speeds we loved in Money 2000. The interface and bells and whistles are similar to 2002, but the performance gain is exhilarating. If you've waited to upgrade and passed over previous versions, but have been itching to use some of Money's sophisticated online banking features, Money 2003 will be worth the leap."
4,It's a good product,"I upgraded from Money 2001 and this really worth the change. Now your accounts are in a more intelligent interface and you can see quickly your last puts.The investment section is also the best part. Now you can arrange many details and see exactly what do you want from your stocks and investments. The only deception is that it's too slow to download quotes and sometimes the software gets halted.The planner are a little simple and need a little customization but in general they are good and useful.If you need to have control of your money, to see how you owe, what you have and how does the flow of your money goes you must try a financial software and Money is a good shot.If you are happy with Money 2002, don't upgrade. And if you are with Quicken 2003, stay where you are."
2,You get what you buy.,I have been a quicken fan for many years. Money has some nice additional features. One reason I will not go with Money is they will not allow you to define and assign my own group. Microsoft defines the groups and will not let you change tham. I want the advantage of definging the groups that make sense in my life and run reports based on these groups.
5,I absolutely love this book!,"This should be a requirement for anybody who wants to know about how soul mates relationship work. In addition it also has a wealth of information on other occult topics such as the akashic records, energy healing, spirit attachment and how to prevent such occurings."
1,Ripped Off,"The person who sold me this book ripped me off. It was in such bad shape that the pages were falling out, the jacket was disconnected from the pages, and there were water stains on the pages. It was almost impossible to read through as it kept falling apart in my hands. This book belonged in the trash not for sale."
5,Real insights into mental illness,"I found this film to be poignant and moving, having had a younger brother who experienced a similar fate and who died in his mid-40s. I still struggle to understand the loss of such a brilliant mind, and shares the same feelings of hopelessness through the entire ordeal -- letters to the President about a family conspiracy against him, breakdowns and institutionalizations, living on the streets at times, living on handouts, refusals to stay on medication, and at the same time, brilliant prose and analysis and a deep understanding of language and literature. And a real compassion for the victims of discrimination on account of race, religion and creed. And such a burning, unrequited need to be loved. Yet, despite a giant intellect, and periods of lucidity, he was drawn down the vortex of mental illness, and never achieved what he otherwise might have been destined to do. Very few days go by when I do not think of him, and the pangs of guilt of the survivor. MHRIP."
1,No English,Ditto other comments... Nowhere does Amazon state that this is a Chinese DVD movie without an English option or even any subtitles. Why it has been returned.
1,Bad Info,I really enjoy this movie but it was not clear when I ordered this version that it was in Chinese. Fortunately I had not broken the seal on the package and was able to send it back in exchange for the English version. Just be aware that this version is in Mandarin Chinese which I later found out.
1,No Human,"Nowhere does Amazon state that this is a DVD, well, actually they did but I didn't see it. I thought it was odd that Amazon would sell an actual emperor when you can't even sell body parts (much less an entire human). Well, I was really disappointed when this was just a flimsy piece of plastic. Can you imagine being able to purchase an actual emperor? Think of all of the stories he could tell you and your family. Well, I need to start thinking more realistically. The movie was interesting."
1,Disappointed,I am an Adidas lover but for I am very disappointed of this particular shoes. It leaves your foot still moistured and the shoes wear out really fast. Do not wear it if you run on wet surfaces because the clima cool texture allow the wet inside your feet will get soaked in no time. Additionally the shoes lack support.
2,Works but not very well.,"This unit is what I would classify as just above a toy. The sounds are OK for a beginner but for any seasoned professional there will be some disappointment. I was very fustrated when I tried to play CD's that I burned myself. Only after looking in the manual did I find out that it doesn't support CD-R/W and some CD-R type CDs. Oh well, needless to say I returned it. I've since ordered the Alesis Guitar Playmate. I'll just see if their attempt at a simple concept turns out any better."
4,Ghost Story with US Ethnic Cleansing insights,"Second Glance is great at explaining the origins of the 20th Century ethnic cleansing programmes. The ghost stories are useful in helping to solve the cold crime committed in 1932 in Vermont. It was captivating and loving. The factual documents illustrate how normal this barbaric behaviour was in this part of the world in this period (pre-World War 11). Nazi Germany carried these principles a little further. What humans do to one another in the name of civilisation! Well done, Jodi!"
4,Another Winner from Picoult,"I am a huge Picoult fan, and Second Glance only served to reinforce her status as one of my favourite authors. Jodi has an amazing knack for tackling dicey and highly emotive issues with great empathy. Her characters are human with all the attendant vulnerabilities, frailties, weaknesses etc.I found the plot in Second Glance was more convoluted than her other books, and I confess that it took me a while to see where it was ultimately going. Nonetheless it was an enjoyable journey for me, and the outcome was credible and satisfactory."
4,"Ghosts, Inner Demons, and So Much More","Jodi Picoult explores life, death, the afterlife, and the enduring quality of love in her novel Second Glance. When a developer wants to build a strip mall on top of an Abenaki Indian burial ground, suspicious circumstances lead the town folks to believe the land is haunted by the spirit of the Abenaki. Ross Wakeman, a ghost hunter, comes to the small town to visit his sister and quickly becomes embroiled in the situation. He is hired by the developer to find out if the property is haunted or not. What he finds on the land will change the rest of his life.It is truly impossible to not be smitten with Jodi Picoult. I have the hardest time putting her novels down. Unlike most of her other novels, Second Glance does not involve a court battle, which was a nice change of pace. This novel is so complex that it is really hard to describe. All the many stories are interconnected. It's complicated, but thrilling. I highly recommend it."
3,it was OK....,"This was the first of Jodi's novels that I've read. After reading all the wonderful reviews, I have to say I was a little disappointed. Maybe it was because it was built up so much. It was entertaining, but not a ""great read"". I don't think it is one that I would re-read. There is nothing to pinpoint my disappointment, other than it just wasn't as exciting, or emotional, or intense as a really great book is. Because I keep on seeing that this is one of Jodi's best books, I'm wondering if I should even bother with the rest of her books."
1,Utter Disappointment,"Typically when reading a novel written by Jodi Picoult I find that I can't put it down. The exact opposite was the case for Second Glance as I found myself struggling to continue after reading a mere 35 pages. All of the elements for a fantastic read are present as is Picoult's spot on writing technique, but the mark was missed by a mile. Another reviewer said that she kept waiting for something to happen and I couldn't agree more. Page after page I was waiting for that ""it"" moment which brought it all together but that moment just wasn't there. This novel just did not make sense."
4,Interesting twists in this one~!,"Love Jodi Picoult stories, and this one really had me guessing about where it would go. I liked the depth of all of the characters, not just the few leads. The paranormal portion could have been 'too fake', but it worked well with the personalities in the story- just the right balance of mystery."
4,Compelling Look at the Supernatural and Eugenics,"I like most Jodi Piccoult books, especially the ones covering supernatural and spiritual topics (Keeping Faith is a favorite), so I wasn't disappointed in this one. I think it is a fascinating tale exploring the idea of ghosts, the relativity of time/space, and - as an added bonus - the dubious field of eugenics. She is even-handed in all these areas, indirectly covering both sides of the issue through characters that represent different viewpoints. And as usual, no one is indisputably 'evil' - Piccoult is much too subtle for that. I didn't quite connect to the characters as much as I usually do in her books, which may just be because this books has so many characters, and jumps between two time periods. But I still couldn't put it down, and felt like I learned a lot about these topics to boot."
3,"imaginative and entertaining, a bit predictable","This book has ghosts, romance, character growth, and family bonds. I'd definitely recommend it for light reading. It was an interesting idea but I found the main premise that the main character can't die a little unbelievable. I was also disappointed that I could see where the story was going in places. On the plus side, it did keep me up at night and spooked me out a little bit. Overall, an entertaining story, not necessarily amazing literature."
2,"Well crafted, but contrived.","Jodi's books have good plots, a twist, a nice legal battle and enough emotion thrown in to make for a great beach read. It aint literature, however, nor will it change your life. Second Glance was just that--good, but not great, it didn't flow that well (I could pinpoint structure and plot changes and character set-ups, sometimes it was like reading an example from an eleventh grade writing class) and the predictable love story was unbelievable and boring and just 'ugh' inducing. (Like most of her novels, including her latest 'my sister's keeper)I recommend it for a beach read, and to rent out of the library, but don't spend good money on it."
4,I loved this one,"Not only was it a great chance to escape from reality for a while it also kept touching on and teaching about a little known (well, at least I didn't know about it) piece of our history. I had never even heard of an eugenics project until I read this but it has me searching for more information. The story itself was fascinating. At first, each character seemed so disconnected from the other that I couldn't even imagine where we were being taken. By the end of the book their lives are so intertwined...amazing. What a wonderful way to tell a great story."
2,Disappointing,"Jodi Picoult's research into the history of the eugenics movement in the United States made for very interesting reading. Unfortunately, the plot which surrounds this research lacks believability, depth and emotion. The characters are very difficult to keep straight, and the love story is just too rushed to have much impact. Finishing the book felt like a chore."
5,I loved this book!,"I only picked up this book because I love Jodi Picoult and was not expecting to like it, I am not into ghost books. However, as I read this book, I fell in love with the characters and I was captivated! I enjoyed the history and the love stories so much. I cried hard during one part and stayed up really late just to finish the book. Read it, its wonderful."
4,Great escape reading,"The book begins with a lot of characters being introduced and confusing the reader. But if you keep reading and don't worry about who's who it all makes sense. I'm not sure if the ghost elements work. Somehow the woman sees the man who later sees her as a ghost or as a sort of visual echo of the past. The amount of coincidences is stunning and everyone ends up with someone. As she does in all her books, Picoult explores a social theme. This time it is eugenics. While it would be agreed that a eugenics policy that calls for cleansing unwanted genes (people) from the society's pool is horrific, the case for genetic testing is less clear.While the amount of coincidences is stunning and everyone ends up with someone, the book is great escape fiction with lots of happy endings."
5,Ghost with a Mission.,"Ross Wakeman, ghost hunter, fails to kill himself several times before he ends up clincally dead then revives to shock a doctor. Jodi Picoult's ""Second Glance"" with it's maze-like introduction of characters; keeps you turning the pages as each one falls into the scheme of her complex plot. She builds her story around the little known movement in the US during the 1920's and 30's of eugencis. Racial cleansing through ""voluntary"" sterlization was conceived in Natzi Germany based on an American practice.Ross is lead through the maze of fable and fact by one of the most intrinsic ghosts in current fiction.Each new addition to Ms. Picoult's literary work is greeted with anticipation.Nash Black, author of ""Taxes, Stumbling Blocks and Pitfalls for Authors 2007"" and ""Qualifying Laps."""
1,Not my favorite Jodi Picoult novel,"To be fair, I should probably wait until I finish this novel before reviewing it. Like several reviewers I have been struggling through this one. It bounces between present day, back 70 years, then back to present day. The detail about the characters, etc in the present day is just too much, simply uninteresting, perhaps irrelevant. I am still reading and waiting to see, hoping for a satisfying ending, but wanted to read other opinions to be sure I wasn't alone, because this is so frustrating! Actually, I very much enjoyed the foray into 1930's eugenics, and this section had stayed with one character so I found myself riveted to this part. Now back into the present day, I am again, though much more interested and vested in the outcome, just so frustrated by the painstaking detail."
5,Ooo! One of her best!,"Ah, the book I have been hinting towards and definitely one of my favorites. This is a lovely ghost story and a book that does not in any way carry that court-room formula of the majority of her work.I love the tie-in to American Eugenics - it adds a lot to have that history in there. Mostly, I love how neat the story is and how all the characters come back to each other and are just so interconnected.It picks up on the ghost-hunting that is a sideline inPlain Truthand the way ""insane"" women are treated like inKeeping Faith: A Novel. This one just might be my all-time favorite of her books..."
4,Several Glances Back,"For anyone who has read a book by Jodi Picoult, it is no surprise that you are completely wowed by the ending of the book, Second Glance was no exception. Second Glance is a fantastic mixture of love, sorrow, history, and ghost stories. Every time I thought I figured out the ending, Picoult threw in a new twist. I felt like I got to know all of the characters and every time I read about a ghost, I felt like one was in the room with me. She made me believe that spirits live on and you never know when you might meet one. The description on that back of the book doesn't even begin to tell the story that Picoult embarks on. Second Glance brings the reader into another world and takes you into a dark spot of America's history. Once you pick up the book, you will not be able to put it down and if you do, you just might feel a chill in the air."
1,I tried so hard...,"I feel like a failure. I tried sooooo hard to get into this book, but it was the literary equivalent of pulling teeth. Tonight was it... I finally gave up. It was the first Jodi Picoult book I picked up and it will probably be my last. I've had this book for over a month and every time I try to pick it up I start nodding off with in an hour of reading it. I can't seem to get in to. I feel awful because everyone keeps saying what a great read this is; I wish I had the same experience. She seems like an awesome writer, but the pace at which the plot/ characters is unveiled (coupled with the storytelling style) makes this just too difficult to get into."
3,Second Glance Review,"Being a huge fan of Jodi Picoult, I give this book 3/5 stars. It took me about 200 pages into it until it got fairly exciting. This was probably one of my least favorite of her books - alot of her books I will go back and read a second time, however this will not be one of them. It was still entertaining enough to want to finish it to see how it ended."
2,Yawn,"For some reason, Jodi Picoult's books sound alot better when I read about them instead of actually reading them. This book just dragged on and on, and just didn't provide any real suspense or excitement. Moreover, the characters were somewhat boring and unlikeable. Good reading for the insomniac."
1,You need a lot of patience to get through this!,"I don't. I find Picoult's writing underdeveloped, pedestrian and the plot contrieved. Wouldn't recommend it even if you are desperate."
1,"""I see dead people!""","Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors, so I recommended Second Glance, her newest novel, for my book club to review. Bad idea. First, The Sixth Sense has been done! Enough of the kids seeing dead people already! It's really getting tiresome. Second, two of the characters were called by three different names, which was confusing. Cecelia was also Cissy and Lia. Grey Wolf was also Az and John. (I think all those names are right--I gave my copy away as soon as I finished reading it). I really had to struggle to finish this book."
2,Condition of book,The book was advertised as 'like new' but it was more like 'fair' but the price was low and since I bought it for my daughter and she didn't seem to mind that the pages were a bit yellowed and bent at the corner it is ok.
2,Too many characters,"I love this author, but couldn't finish it. Too many characters to keep track of. I read in small chunks, so I gave up about 1/3 through. Disappointing. I've loved other book of hers I have read."
2,Not one of my favorites..,"I have likes many of Jodi Picoult books but this is my least favorite that I have read to date. I listen to many audio books on my drive and I'm usually looking forward to getting in the car to here the next ""chapter"". This one didn't grab my attention. I had to force myself to finish."
4,Intriguing read,"I really liked this book. Let it be known that I think I have read all of Picoult's books, since she was recommended to me by my ""apple doesn't fall far from the tree"" Englihs major daughter.There were many things that attracted me to this one, not the least of which was that it is an earlier book that had not yet fallen into the ""courtroom"" trap that the later novels have.The first third of the book is perplexing at best. So many characters and potential plot lines. My interest started to wane, but I persevered. . . The middle section is riveting, and then everything comes together in the final third.If you have ANY interest in the paranormal, history, eugenics, and/or mothering, then I think you will enjoy this one."
5,Love this book!,Love most all Jodi Picoult books and this one is no exception. Jodi keeps you guessing and wondering throughout her stories. Love the little twists and turns!
3,suspenseful,I like the learning aspect of Jodi Picoult's books. This one discusses Eugenics and discrimination in a way that keeps you interested in the history while you're caught up in the story.
2,look away,Maybe if I had read this book of hers first I would have a better opinion of it. But I thought it droned on and on.
4,"Slow Start, Great Finish","It took me nearly 200 pages to really get into this book, and if I didn't have faith that Jodi Picoult would take the story somewhere I might have given up. It begins with a lot of characters, many different stories, and a seeming lack of direction. However, she manages to tie all of the characters and plots together beautifully in a compelling and unique story.Although the last couple of Jodi Picoult's books have been let downs to me, this one lived up to my somewhat lowered expectations. Picoult delves into an unchartered territory of ghosts and Indians in Vermont, alternating from an unsolved mystery of the 1930's with present day Vermont. Despite somewhat predictable relationship dramas, the rest of this book, it's rich historical basis as well as compelling characters, make for a great read."
3,Second Glance...not quite.,"This story was just barely above a snooze-fest for me. 3 stars is being generous. The main character was not very likeable and it was hard to identify with his perspective on life and why he chose the profession of ghost hunting after losing a great love. The story can be confusing at time and may turn readers off in the first part, getting lost in various characters that you don't quite get their purpose in the story. It all comes together in the end, if not a bit contrived."
4,Very entertaining,"I loved this book. I liked all the characters and the way their stories/life were entertwined. For some of my friends they did not like that there was so much jumping around and said it was hard to follow. Not for me, I highly recommend this book it is hard to put it down."
3,Jodi always AMAZES,I have read so many of her books and felt this one was out of her comfort zone. Although a great read not exactly one of my favorites of hers. Ending came quick but a little too far fetched for me. She never disapoints tho.
3,Second time for second glance,This book was copyrighted in 2003. Why is it being presented as a New book? It's a good Picoult book but most of us who are her fans have read it!
4,Good Service,Book arrived in good condition a few days ahead of schedule. Seller let me know shortly after order was placed shipping datel
5,What a READ! Read it!,"I started this book on a Sunday afternoon, and after getting the characters straight (it doesn't take THAT long) I could not put the book down. The twists, turns, and surprise ending keeps you enthralled - Jodi's characters come to life! I thoroughly enjoyed Ross, who seemed to live a charmed life. And the kids - wow! It is so refreshing for me, as I am an AVID reader, to find an author who has the ""gift"" to keep her reader up till 3 a.m. to see what happens next! Great book! Read it!"
4,Second Glance,"Comtosook, Vermont is a sleepy little town that has suddenly been thrown into turmoil over a development battle on what the Abenaki Indians believe is a sacred burial ground.Ross Wakefield is investigating the ghosts that the Abenaki feel have been disturbed by the construction. In doing so, he will stir up many secrets within the community and Vermont's history of eugenics as well as some unexplainable phenonmenon.As usual, Jodi Picoult tells a captivating story that has the readers questioning what they believe. There were a few loose ends in this one as the cast of characters is large, but a great read on interesting subjects."
2,Not impressed,"I am a huge, huge Picoult fan. I think her writing is fabulous, and her plots are usually riveting.However, I found this book so cliched, I could barely believe that it was written by the same author I've loved for years. It was juvenile and predictable, even though she tried to add plot twists. The metaphors and similies were overused. I almost didn't finish it, but decided to give it a chance. Sadly, I was disappointed."
2,Wake me when it is finished - no target audience here either,"There is nothing ground breaking or even new in this book. It is reminiscent of the late 60's and early 70's ""I feel yah man"" approach. I'm obviously no youngster and I'm definitely not in the target audience either. It is an okay book but one I wouldn't recommend."
1,40 Unforgettable Dates with Your Mate,20 Unforgettable Dates with Your Mate was forgettable. Was looking for some good ideas but this book really did not provide me with any. I would not recommend this book.
4,Good Idea,I got this for a wedding gift recently for my friend. Sometimes I'm looking for something creative to do with/for my husband and ourSimply Romantic Nightshas good ideas. I thought this book might have even more.
1,No god stuff for me thanks.,"I appreciate my fellow seculars giving me the heads up about all the christianess of it. I dont belive, god is not real just something ignorance uses to explain what they dont understand."
2,Equal partnership or male headship?,"Although this book is free, your time is still valuable. Therefore, before deciding to download, you should be aware that this book is aimed at Christians who believe that there are essential differences between men and women, and that men's particular characteristics make them better suited to lead. These assumptions shape the book in ways both obvious and subtle. For example, both husbands and wives are advised to make a date to participate in their spouse's hobby, but the dates are framed differently: husbands should help their wives, while wives should learn from their husbands. If these beliefs reflect your own, go forth and download. If not, well, there are still some potentially useful date ideas and discussion topics, albeit nothing you couldn't come up with on your own."
3,Good,"This book has some good ideas. It is a bit dated, but much of it can quite useful. I recommend it as a starting place."
3,Seaplane Operations,A reprint of a comprehensive seaplane manual that has been updated. Good for todays operations and a glimpse of history.
5,Awesome,"Best CD I bought in a while, really up beat and motivating. perfect to listen in the car before going clubbing, especially pete tong's cd"
3,Cluttered format. There are better Korean books out there.,"This was my first Korean cookbook and I am not that impressed with it. What is good about it is that there are many photographs (step-by-step for most recipes which is very nice), the recipes are all lowfat and healthy, and the recipes are very representative of what Koreans actually eat. Many Asian dishes are very Americanized these days. Anyway, my main issue with this book is that some of the ingredients are going to be impossible to find unless you live in an area that has a substantial Korean population and Korean market. I find the organization of the ingredients and instructions for each recipe to be very cluttered. The pages actually look too ""busy."" I also prefer my ingredients to be in list format and the ingredient lists in this book are in a paragraph-like format. There are much better Korean cookbooks out there. Get something else."
3,Acceptable,"The book was is good condition and I received it in reasonable time but it said with listening comprehension audio CD, that were not included."
1,2nd time ordering- hope you get it right.,"I ordered this book and CD set; but only recieved the book without CD. It was an incomplete order. I sent the book back in hopes that you can get the whole order right as discribed on the information page. EXAMPLE---Destinos Student Edition w/Listening comprehension Audio CD, 2nd Edition. Thank you!"
4,good deal,"This product was shipped to my son, who was very pleased. The packaged came with everything that was advertised. It turned out to be a good deal."
5,Excellent Spanish Text,"This book is an excellent text for studying Spanish. It doesn't tell where one can access the online video episodes. If I hadn't previously known, I would have been very upset. Otherwise it is an excellent text and the practise CDs that accompanied the text are very helpful."
5,Absolutely LOVE the Series - A Mom & Kid Review,"I am offering a review about the VHS tapes on the series. Currently, I am checking them out at a local library...fantastic! My son and I have learned so much and enjoy the storyline! I highly recommend them."
2,Destinos Text,"This is a nice book but without the cd's its usefulness is greatly reduced. This book was misrepresented as in the order it showed the cd's as part of the package but when I received the book the invoice noted ""missing cd's"". I realize the book was very inexpensive but I was expecting the cd's from the description of the order."
2,ridiculous,"One of Elmore Leonard's greatest talents is showing fools go wrong. But most of his work is within the realm of the possible. This book goes so far over the edge, so fast, that it whacks the reader over the head. Almost didn't finish this one."
1,Please Read - These Blocks are Terrible,"I'm not sure how these blocks got any positive reviews. Most important to me...all the blocks with the pic of an elephant are misspelled and read ""elerhant"". The pictures over all are not great. The grapes look like cherries...have you ever seen candy apple red grapes? The apples look like red pumpkins. Some of the blocks have pictures but the corresponding letter has been replaced by a symbol and other letters...confusing to a child trying to learn. Additionally, the quality of these blocks is not great as the paint was already scratched off on a few when they arrived and the wood is frayed on some. They have a strong odor (kind of like clay). Lastly, they are quite small as others warned although the size is clearly written in the description. I expect to see a set like this at a dollar store and would not recommend."
3,"Great blocks, but sharp","My daughter loved playing with these blocks. They're good to stack, or put in and out of the box. My only issue is that they are very sharp if you happen to step on one and sliced my foot open. But just sitting down playing with them was totally fine."
2,Blocks mispelled,"My daughter received these blocks for her 1st birthday. The word ""elephant"" is spelled ""elerhant"". How are we to teach our children anything when their toys are misspelled?"
4,Nice toy,"I like that these blocks have a nice wooden box to stack them in when play is over. But could do without the plexiglass lid. My son loves to dump them out then load them into his train or stack them. They are colorful. But I have noticed that the paint and or wood is chipping on some of them. That worries me a bit as I don't want them to become to sharp or give splinters. Other than that, the blocks work well."
5,Wooden Blocks,"Perfect for a toddler. Mom & Dad build, toddler knocks down. Then toddler begins to build. Wonderful for imagination."
3,Not a bad product,"These blocks were overall everything that was stated in the listing. I maybe should have looked at the finer print because the blocks were much smaller than I was expecting. I would not recommend these for any kids younger than 3 yrs, as my 22 month old daughter is still at an age where she could hurt herself or someone else with the blocks. The corners are sort of on the sharper, pointier side, and I would rather they were not quite that sharp. The price is not bad but I do know you can find some better choices at some of the chain stores for about the same price, $10, give or take a few dollars."
4,Good product,"Got this for my grandaughter. It is smaller than I realized it would be, but they are sturdy blocks and I'm sure she will play with them often."
3,smaller than I had hoped,just the right size for tiny little girl hands right now but awfully small to try to stack and build.
1,Misspelling on alphabet blocks?!,"I bought these blocks last Christmas even though my child was too small for them. Eight months later, I brought them out and he enjoyed playing with them. I was happy until I looked at the blocks more carefully. Each block has a picture with the name of the object below. Unfortunately, all the words under the elephant picture say ELERHANT. Do not buy these blocks."
3,I don't really recommend it.,"It's kind of a take off on Encyclopedia Brown or the Hardy Boys - a young kid who wants to be a PI and solves murders in his town - but it's not very well written. I think the writing style might appeal to kids because it's very conversational, but it's also very juvenile - which again might appeal to kids but it didn't to me. The author is big on pop-culture and regional references, which I was told not to use in a creative writing class I took, and now I see why. Plus - and this is the funny part - the 'hero' is always passing out, like some Victorian damsel or something. He gets scared and passes out. Several times per book. It's weird and funny."
2,"Looks great, feel great....not well made, customer service stinks","This watch looks great and feels great. I receive compliments on it all the time. It's fairly well made, but it has started to fall apart after about 3 years of use. The pins have both been replaced several times. The watch clasp has been repaired. One of the minute marks on the face of the watch came off, which got the watch jammed and now the hour and minute hands are off. I have tried to call customer service multiple times. Sometimes I get through, sometimes I don't. When I finally did get through one and requested a replace band part (it broke, too), they sent me the wrong part. I called again. This time they just didn't send anything."
4,nice album (old-Cash Money-style),"good album, tight beats, average lyrics.best tracks are ""Get Ur Roll On"" (firrreee), ""My Life"", ""Stuntastic"" and ""Big Tymers"".if U like the old Cash Money sound (not the new [stuff] like the Birdman or Boo & Gotti), this is a must-buy"
2,Not worthy of the Cash Money label,"I was really looking foward to this CD because I think Cash Money Records is the one of the best out there, no one will ever compare to Bone. But unfortunately this CD did absolutely nothing for me. I can't stand the Big Tymers. They are definately the weak link in Cash Money and shouldn't be on anyone elses tracks let alone have their own CD. The best parts are where Lil Wayne gets to shine because he is the best Cash Money has. The beats aren't anything special and a lot of the songs sound the same. Too slow and extremely boring, avoid this one and buy Lil Wayne!"
2,This album is garbage,"I hate this album so much it gives me a headache! The only tight song on the album is ""Big Tymers"". The first two albums sound nothing like this one. I want my money back!!!! I can't wait til a new B.G. album come out."
3,Big Tymers is ok,Big Tymers is ok but they need to do sum more work into dis album. Ony thing that i got to say GET YO ROLL ON is off da heezy fo sho. Dat is my theme song when i hit the street.
2,DISS IS WACK!!!!,"DISS CD IS JUST PLANE BAD!!!,.,.ALL THE TRUE CASH MONEY FANS ARE GOING TO SAY ITS OFF THE HOOK BUT IT AINT THE ONLY THINGS I LIKE BOUT DISS CD IS THE COVER!!!"
5,better than the us copy,this is a must have cd. though i lost the track list to mine-ill probely sell for the right price
5,THIS CD STUNNTIN OUT OF THIS WORLD,"I DIDDN'T KNOW THE BIG TYMERS COULD LAY STUFF DOWN LIKE THIS, BUT YALL CAN'T BEAT THAT TURK ALBUM, YOUNG AND THUGGIN HOTBOY"
1,The Perfect Example of Mainstream Junk,"I don't mean to be spoiler to anyone who has this CD but this CD is just mainstream hype. To put it bluntly, it's trash. The beats are pretty phat, but the lyrics are simple, unimaginative, repetetive and definitely one of the worst I ever heard. Turk is the only rapper that deserves some credit for his flowy lyrics. The rhyme schemes are ridiculously simple, like rhyming ""do"" and ""too"". The message is the same stupid one that is swarming the mainstream rap scene of (...), dough, gatz, only magnified times 10."
1,this is one of the woprst of 00,cash money once agin produces anothger coaster for you to put your drink on this is one of the worst albums of 2000 i can't believe people like this come on this ain't even quality shit
1,GARBAGE,this is the worst cd i've heard in my life. Casymoney is garbage. don't get any of there cd. this cd is just a waist of money.
3,A Pretty Good Follow Up,"This is a very good CD with super tight songs such as #1 Stunna and Big Tymers. However, it can't match up with their previous release, How U Love That Vol. 2. If you think this CD's tight, then definitely pick up How U Love That Vol. 2. I gurantee you that it's twice as good."
5,******A MUST-HAVE! ******,"If you want to listen to some good beats while cruising in your truck or car, the Big Tymers will definitely get your roll on!"
5,Great Album,"It's me from Chucktown again telling you that this album is worth getting. It's all good for this album, especially Get Your Roll On and Snake. But overall the Big Tymers did great with this CD and you should check it out."
5,Da Best CMR Yet,"This CD is off tha hook i think it is better than 400 Degreez! Get Your Roll on is awesome! Along with 3,4,6,7,10,13,and all of dem dare! Keep it on lock wit CMR woday!"
4,Game Spittin' M.F.,"If you like game spittin' then get this album. Some tight tracks are Get Your Roll On, #1 Stunna, We Hustle, and 10 Ways. A Cash Money classic."
5,Great for the price !!!,I've had this belt for about 5 months now. Very high quality for the price. I use it everyday. Does the job well.
4,Need Sizing Chart,"I am a 36"" waist, and the medium belt is snug at the last holes in the belt. If you have a 36"" waist, you need a ""large"" belt."
1,Not a proper weight belt,"Basically the problem is this, if you don't know. The function of a weight belt is to give your abdominal muscles something to push against. The belt is tight and offers resistance so that the abs can push harder and therefore brace the torso/spine more effectively. That's what a belt is supposed to do.Now, it makes no sense to have the belt be six inches tall in the back and 2 inches in the front. This is just poor design. A proper belt should be 4 inches the entire way around. Look into Inzer Belts, they are quality. Yes, you're going to pay more for a quality belt but any belt that is bigger in the back and small in the front is just improper design and won't function as well as one that is designed properly.Save your money and put it towards a belt that is designed by people who actually understand the function of a belt."
4,Very good product (review in spanish),"Muy buen cinturón, soy talla 34 y el ""m"" me va perfecto, super resistente, el colocarlo es medio engorroso cuando está nuevo porque tienes que apretarlo mucho contra el cuerpo, sin embargo a pesar de no tener el ajustador que traen otros productos mas modernos este se va muy bien porque es imposible que se ruede en media actividad física, recomendado!!!"
4,Great belt,"I haven't used too many lifting belts but this one fits very well. Make sure you pay attention to the sizing chart someone posted. I think if I didn't see that chart, I'd have gotten one that was too big. That's why I took off a star cause something that works so well should have a chart. That one reviewer saved me a lot of time.The belt is made of leather. Not sure what kind but it's very sturdy and pliable. I expected some issues since the front is smaller than the back side but when I used it, my abs were definitely snug and I can feel my back supported. Great belt."
3,Be aware dip attachments wont fit ...,"This is a great quality belt, however, due to the width of the belt in the front, you can not attach a dip chain for adding weight."
4,Better Than Nylon,"I purchased this belt after a nylon one. I did not like the nylon as it did not provide enough support for me. This belt is comfortable, does the job and not only provides support but forces good posture while lifting. As usual, Amazon is great!The belt is stiff, but that is normal and will break in with use. Careful on sizing, it tends to run bigger."
3,"only okay, creases a bit","I've used the belt around 15-20 times. Already though, the leather has creased a bit near where the prongs go through the holes that I'm using. I suspect that over time the holes will crack and expand into the crease, and eventually tear.I started using a belt a bit too late, only after injuring my back. I'll definitely be using one belt or another from now on. If and when I replace this one, probably sooner than I would have liked, I'll be willing to spend more for something that I think will be more durable."
1,Good Support Terrible Quality,I actually did like this belt when I first bought as it did provide good stability but now it is less than 6 months later and no more than 30 uses with it only heavy lifts (85% and above for minimal reps) and the leather is already ripping where I put the prongs. I can still use it barely but it will rip all the way soon and it will be useless. Look to Inzer for a quality belt. Buying this is like buying anything cheap. It may work well for some time but you will have to replace it. I didn't even get the chance to break it in.
1,"A ""Flat"" Biography","""Tempest in a Flat Hat"" (2004) offers nothing new on the life and art of Buster Keaton. The book merely represents ""a fan's notes"" while regurgitating material from other Keaton biographies. As Groucho Marx would say, ""Some writing feat."""
2,Go watch his movies instead...,"I just finished this book and I found little insight to Keaton as a person. I wouldn't really call this book a biography. It's more of a chronological synopsis of each of his films with anecdotes of his life splashed here and there. It's a great book if you really want to know about plot lines and what happened on set. If you want to know about the man, choose another book."
3,Sci Fi lite,"A collection of about 30 short stories (10-12 pages) that involve alien visitors to the Draco Tavern (located in Siberia). Each story is based on one interesting idea, however, the treatment is pretty superficial and the repetitive descriptions of the tavern and the recurring alien species gets a bit tedious as you read more of the stories."
4,Interesting thoughts,Al always there are interesting aspects to the Nive storries. The reasons for not rating it with 5 stars is that stories are a bit short (Just as my mind starts thinking it is already over.) and then the difficult names of the persons involved makes it difficult to give the story a place in my mind.
2,I have NO idea what Niven is trying to accomplish here . . .,"Niven has been a major sf author for decades and his work is usually of high quality. Unfortunately, very little of that quality appears in this collection of twenty-seven very short stories, all set in a bar on the edge of a Siberian spaceport that hosts a wide array of alien visitors. These aren't shaggy dog stories, though, or whimsical character portraits. In fact, it's hard to tell just what they're supposed to be. Each story introduces one or more aliens in conversation with (usually) the bartender/owner, Rick Schumann. So they schmooze, and the alien tells a story, and that's it. I kept wondering whether the end of each story had been omitted, and that was why they were all so short. Sorry, I don't see the point."
2,No cal/no nutrition snacks,"Long time fan, but didn't get much out of this one. Stories were cute. Didn't finish it, not worth more time."
2,Don't buy this for the business features,"I have used MS money for several years, and found it to be an acceptable product. This year I upgrade to the business edition to help manage my small business. Unfortunately the program features provided for business are not complete enough to be useful. The limitations of the invoices are a good example. There is no way to record a discount given to a particular customer. Also, there is no way to record the credit card fee subtracted from each transaction. Finally the invoice is so rigid there is no way to annotate particular items with explanatory notes.Also, several of my financial institutions are set up to interwork with Quicken, but do not interwork with Money."
1,"Congratulations, you've found the biggest waste of money!","If I ever had a recommendation not to buy a product this is it. The questions you may have of course will be passed and passed around Microsoft support until you have absolutely no answer. I am taking this disaster off my computer and burning it. Do yourself a favor, go buy a ledger and pencil before you waste your time on this software."
1,"save your money, buy a different program","Frustrating program, frustrating help system. Most features do not work. Worthless for business."
5,A Marriage After God's Own Heart,"This is an excellent book to give as a wedding gift.Encourage the newly married who invited God to their wedding to also invite Him into their marriage!Kim Parker,Richmond, Virginia"
5,I read this book and wanted it to go on...,This was a pretty great book! Although the title didn't really fit the contents of this book. I liked the friendship between Bruno and Bailey. It seems like something that is meant to be. I really felt like this book should have went on and that it was unfinished. I would enjoy a sequal to this wonderful book!
5,Very good product,"This CD is really recommendable. My favorite on it was the ""Liadov"". I mean that Cherkassky is not reached by modern Pianists - or for me he symbolizes the good old time?"
3,not the greatest book,"Although the publishing date is stated as 1979, this is just a reprint of a book from 1942. While learning the basics of carving hasn't changed much in the more than half a century since this book's first publication, the patterns and designs in this book are somewhat dated. A book with more and more modern patterns and ideas would be a better choice."
1,I thought you were supposed to learn real Java,"It is too bad that this is required reading for a Java course, I think this book would be more effective lighting a fire than teaching you Java. It screams at you about keywords then fails to correctly use them itself.My biggest problem with this book is the packages it uses. It doesn't bother actually using any standard java package, it uses a couple of third-party tools to try to teach you everything. Something called TerminalIO for the command line, and BreezySwing for gui. I'm surprised they didn't try to create their own System.out object for use especially with this book."
4,Ecco Sandals,"I have worn Ecco shoes for years, and am pleased to find that their sandals are of the same high quality -- excellent workmansip, good appearance and real comfort."
1,Anecdotal. Not for serious buyers of business.,"This book just does not seem to get to the heart of the matter. I was looking for an indepth guide to the buying and selling of businesses. This fell well short of my expectations and I am sure most professionals will be thoroughly disappointed. The chapter on business valuations is a joke, and the chapter on ""Steps to find buyers and sellers"" is even worse."
3,More Sex Than Spanking,"I was hoping for something between instruction and porn. This is definitely skewed toward porn, with far more time spent on non-spanking foreplay and intercourse than on ""Spanking 101"". I would've preferred several couples demonstrating different techniques and talking about their reactions. Nina's interview (how she got her nickname: ""Spanky"", which role she prefers, etc.) was FAR more interesting than watching non-spanking lesbian action."
5,Pleasantly surprised by the value of this special friend.,"""Wormy"" is our little girl's nighttime friend. This toy has slept in bed with our little one for almost a year. He is quiet in bed, but livens up when you crinkle, squeak, or rattle his colorful segments. We didn't find all of his hidden qualities initially, and we have been surprised by all of his tricks. There is one quality, though, that has been priceless. He makes a wonderful positioning pillow. He isn't cushy, heavy, or in any way a suffocation danger as some pillows are. He is slender and soft and fits neatly (much like a body pillow) down the full length of our child. She sleeps quietly with him tucked in place -- big enough to keep her from rolling over, soft enough to be comfortable, loveable enough to help her sleep. ""Wormy"" has become mother's helper and baby's friend."
5,Great toy,I bought 3 of these inchworms for Christmas gifts one of which went to my daughter who was 3 months old then. At that age she really liked the bright designs and colors on the worm as well as the crinkle noises. Now at 8 months old she likes to play with the little legs on the worm. She also enjoys the face on the inchworm.
4,a great friend to have,"My daughter, who is 3 months, likes to look and bat at her inchworm. She gets excited when she gets him to rattle. The only negative thing I have to say about is that I wish more of the sections did stuff. Only 2 crinkle and one has a squeaker(which is kind of stuffed too far in, not that she could do it yet anyways). Four of the sections don't do anything. The head and tail have rattles. It may sound like enough but when you have it out in front of your baby you have to move it so the section that crinkles is right in front. Otherwise is a durable and pleasing bring a long friend"
1,Not so great....,My baby (nine months old) isn't the slightest bit interested in this toy - and hasn't been since he was two months old. There are betters toys out there......
3,Lamaze Wiggle Worm,This has been our daughter's favorite toy since day 1. Shae has spent hours staring at it. She is now 8 months old and loves chew on the strings and make it rattle. She still enjoys looking at its striving visual patterns. She has formed quite an attachment to her inch worm.
2,mediocre,"i am glad that i bought this cd used, so i don't feel that ripped off. the mixing is decent, but the tracks are a bit boring. nothing on this cd really stands out. if you like frankie bones, then you may find this worth listening to."
3,2nd two episodes are great,The first episode has a somewhat low density of information. You might want to skip it and then come back or just use clips from it if you are using it in a class room.
3,Has some good points,"I purchased this video to enhance my students' knowledge of numbers and shapes (the first two scenes). The numbers part was quite boring. I fell asleep. It wasn't even interesting. However, once I started watching the shapes part of the video, I truly enjoyed it! This video leaves me asking why there is nothing out there that really puts the pieces together for an average Math person that simply enjoys Mathematics."
2,Not the same book as shown in pic,"The book I received had the same title but was not the book shown in pic and definitely not the book I wanted. I am highly didpleased.From the reviews, it looks like this has happened before. This gives this place a bad name."
4,cool cool,"i don't actually have the cd, but i've heard some songs off of it. for a first cd they are pretty good, but i think they're a little too heavy. i'm more into punk rock, so it suprised me that i like apartment 26. my one big recommendation is to make some bass solos."
2,so much potential...,"Apartment 26 strike me as a band with a lot of potential. Unfortunatly, Hallucinating isn't all that great. On the plus side, it is a moderately experimental blending of metal and electronic music. However, there are few songs that are really worth listening to. They all just kind of run together into a relatively bland mess of distorted guitar and computer bleeps. The only song that really stands out is the hidden instrumental track at the end of the CD. It seems to be the only actual realization of the unique creativity hiding just below of the surface.While Hallucinating is a somewhat weak effort, I still believe it to establish Apartment 26 as a band to watch for in the future."
3,"Interesting, but something lacks","I cannot deny that Apartment 26 has delivered a very interesting debut album. This mix of techno and hard rock is something that is still a very fresh and original sound. However, I don't feel that the songs on this album are up to par w/ the music's unique sound. With the exception of ""Backwards,"" which is an exceptional song, the songwriting is average. If your interested in taking a listen to some fairly unchartered musical territory, this might be for you. However, I really wouldn't recommend it on any other level."
4,Top class industrial,"Rare combination on certain songs: DnB combined with metal.These guys not only get away with it, they manage to sound very good. At first they reminded me of ""sacrifice"" from ""razed in black"". The thing that sets them apart, is that they managed to keep the rough edges of their sound whereas ""razed in black"" sounds smoother. This comes down to a matter of taste but I prefer the rough sound."
4,Their Fifth Best Is Still Pretty Good,"I have been a Bonzo fan for more than 30 years, having discovered them right after they disbanded. Bonzo's witty lyrics and stage antics distracted many listeners from their high degree of musicianship. The performances are very strong and the songs are catchy and memorable.The first four Bonzo albums are all masterpieces of dada pop/rock: get Gorilla, Urban Spaceman, Tadpoles and Keynsham (and yes, I recommend that you should buy them - each deserves five stars) before you buy Anthropology. Anthropology is mostly demos for Tadpoles and Keynsham. If you get the Cornology box set plus Anthropology then you will have almost everything."
5,unbelievable talent,and so deserving of wider recognition. he's on the road playing in Melissa Etheridge's band right now. . crank this LOUD. . . it is a really fun album
4,Hop on board the Peace Machine,"You're probably thinking ""Oh great - another guy playing a worn Stratocaster thinking he is Stevie Ray Vaughn"". Wrong. What drew me to this CD was that the songs were fresh and fun and had no trace of the cliches that can make this music boring - and the playing and musicianship is outstanding."
5,Great blues rock CD by Philip Sayce,"Philip Sayce is one of my favorite guitar players. He has an unique guitar playing style with traditional influences from Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and so on. This CD shows what he is capable of in terms of guitar playings and song writtings. I like his guitar tones, arrangements of songs, singing techniques and so on from the CD. Even though, the price is high for a CD, I highly recommand this CD."
5,Great looks and performance,"I leave this kettle on the stove top permanently, it's so pretty. I've had it a few months now, and it performs perfectly. The whistle is loud and reliable. I can hear it across the other side of the house on the next floor up."
1,Absurd and Sloppy,"I watched this movie with high exepectations due to Mr. Liu's previous films..However I was very diapointed, as the quality of the film wasn't even up to the kind of kung fu films that make fun of kung fu films..The plot was implausable and at times disgusting with lots of peeing on each other... The Kung fu itself wasn't even run of mill... to sum it up ridiculous.. don't wast your money..."
1,Not my music...,"One word only: ""awful"".There is nothing else to say,wrong music for the wrong buyer.There is nothing else to say.I willnever buy something like this."
3,Almost Perfect,If it's almost perfect why just three stars? Well the design can't be beat. Especially the fence and the ingenious means for supporting the workpiece beyond the table top. I've also found the adjustment gauge very accurate. With all these positives though the motor must keep cranking and that's what it didn't do. In the year I have owned this saw it has seen some weekend work but nothing like what it would go through on a job site. The motor quit on me while ripping a 2x4. I am returning it and replacing it with the Bosch. A strong motor is more important than the 'Nice To Have' features. Also while reading the reviews on the Bosch I discovered I'm not the only one who experienced this problem.
4,Nice little workhorse,"Among all the portable table saws I've used, this is the best. Although the DeWalt has some quirks such as the fence getting out of alignment, these are easily over come. Even though this saw uses the traditional sidewinder motor, it's performed flawlessly, never bogging down even under the thickest stock, fresh or old. If you routinely throw this in the back of your truck and take it to a job, you'll probably need to check to see that the blade is square and the fence is true, but very little else. Never had a problem with the switch (as other reviewers indicated). Recommended above all other portable table saws."
3,A Table Saw with a plastic housing,I have used the Dewalt for about 3 years now. The 744 has a good motor but that is the best part. In the last three years I have had to adjust the fence about 10 times. The body is made of plastic and has some cracks. I keep the saw on the table stand and wouldn't think of transporting from job to job. I have had to cover the fence with new material. The miter is hard to set and the mechinisms have to be cleaned and lubricated constantly.
5,It Cuts it Up!!,"Not too shabby for the price. But you do get what you pay for! If you're considering this for general carpentry or some beginning woodworking, go for it. However, it's a bear to get and keep the blade parallel and there is no lock for the blade height. So if you're planning some serious woodworking ... hold-off 'til you can afford a better tool."
5,Great Portable Tablesaw,"This is one of, if not, the best portable tablesaw you can buy. It's fairly light, powerful, accurate, and the included base just makes it that much better. I have had mine for about 9 months and the only problem I've had was replacing the blade. The fence is so accurate that you don't need to double check it with a tape measure. If the tape on the fence say's 19 15/16"", that's exactly what you'll get. The saw will cut sheets of plywood in half without a problem. If you want a good tablesaw for home or work, or if you don't have room for a larger saw, this is the saw to get."
5,Couldn't live without it!,"Sure, you can spend a lot less money, but I've used the ""cheapies"" before and no thanks!The stand is excellent the way it folds flat and has tabs to quickly lock the saw in place. The built-in hand holds make moving to the job site a breeze. Especially handy is the built-in dust collection port that attaches to a standard wet/dry vac.The single best feature would be the fence. It rides parrallel to the blade, operates very smoothly, extends over 24"", has a very nice reading scale, and lifts off easily for miter work.I am a cabinetmaker and installation contractor and this is my job site saw. If you are a hobbyist with lots of room in your shop buy a big saw. But if you need a small saw for occasional use or if you need something to set up where you're working, don't cheat yourself-buy this saw."
4,Clever design; so-so mitre gauge,Things I like: compact design; powerful for its size; light weight; brilliant rack-and-pinion design for the fence.Things I don't like: Mitre gauge is relatively flimsy; hard to remove blade guard for dados and tenon cuts.
1,"Don't buy this, Amazon has the same saw cheaper!","I purchased this saw for $499 with free shipping and then did a search for ""Dewalt"" later on to see what I could find. I was shocked to find the exact same saw for sale on amazon for the exact same price, but with extra accessories! Just search for ""DEWALT DW744SB Heavy-Duty 10"" Portable Table Saw with Stand, Out Feed Support and Extra Blade"". I cancelled my original order and ordered this one. I just thought I'd give everyone a heads-up."
4,Best fence for price,"We use this saw for residential carpentry. The fence is the easiest to align and keep straight for consistent cuts. We own several dewalt table saws and they have been consistent performers with little to no issues. We used to use grizzly saws but they were too bulky and not residential electric friendly. I can recommend this saw for plywood, composite boards and cementitious siding (with appropriate blades of course). I would give this 4.75 stars if I could, I'm very picky about giving a perfect rating."
3,"""not quite""","I've owned Dewalt tools for quite a while and after using the 12 inch mitre saw I was impressed,so I had no problem picking the Dewalt over the Bosch. The Dewalt table saw has the nice features,and is a precise tool, but I bought it to use on the job site, and you pay a premium for the portability in a table saw, but the Dewalt lacks the ruggedness to go along with the riggors of being on the job site. Thats why I only give it 3 stars."
1,"Not dependable, a real pain to deal with!","I thought that I was getting my husband a very reliable product for his construction projects. After using it only 2 times, the saw keeps shutting down on him. They tell us the brushes need cleaning. Well, try cutting a few sheets of wood and then having to take the tablesaw apart to clean it so that it will start up again. Don't get too comfortable in your project......it all starts over again after a few sheets of wood are passed through. I am really sorry I bought this product. I still think that I got a refurbished one that someone else sent back!"
4,Wow what a fence!,"I've owned the Dewalt since it first came out. So far I haven't had any trouble with it. I cut oak, walnut, etc. without any problems. This isn't a cabinet saw, so don't expect it to cut through thick materials all day. It works fine for about anything else. The miter that came with the saw is pretty cheap, I replaced it with a better one. My only complaint with the saw is that the blade is so close to the front edge that it makes cross-cuts on anything wider than 4 or 5 inches a hassle. It does have the best fence adjustment system that I have ever used. After you have used the Dewalt rack&pinion fence system you won't want to use anything else. My advice...if this is your only saw save your money and buy a bigger more powerful one like the Delta Platinum. If you lack space or need portability, this is a nice saw."
2,dissatified,"I am a trim carpenter(40 Years).First bought this saw when it first came out(4or5years ago)loved it and worked well.Tilting the blade became a little worn.Back end started trailing 1 or 2 degrees.Bought a new one and was very disappointed in the new one.The quailty was not the same as the old one.Tighten the blade insert and the back end rides up, so blade hits on 45 degrees.The stand is whats the worst, it wobbles. Legs come in pieces and are bolted together, bottom of legs has no cross bracing like the two models before.First one was really heavy duty, real stable.Contacted dewalt and sales representative recieved no satifaction."
3,Pretty good saw,"Pretty good saw for its size. set up went quickly after I sent the first one back. Absolutely could not square the blade with table. I could square up the blade on the replacement saw, but just barely by really forcing the blade against the stops. Appears this model needs another 1/6"" play in adjustment. Fence is a good one. If you replace the so/so blade that comes with it you need to shim the blace out on the arbor or it will rub. Even the one that comes with it has 0 clearence."
1,LOOK ELSESWHERE BEFORE YOU BUY THIS SAW,"I INSTALL KITCHENS AND COUNTERTOPS FOR A LIVING SO I USE THIS SAW JUST ABOUT EVEYDAY,ITS A YEAR AND A THREE MONTHS OLD AND THE SWITCH WENT OUT OF IT,THEN TWO WEEKS LATER THE MOTOR BURNS UP IN IT,I WOULD'NT RECOMEND THIS SAW TO MY WORST ENEMY!!!!!! AND AFTER EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS DEWALT WONT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT...SO I SPENT [MONEY} ON A PIECE OF JUNK JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER DEWALT TOOLS I USE THAT ARE BROKE .....MY ADVISE---BUY A DIFFERENT BRAND !!!"
4,"DEWALT DW744S 10""","The saw was not in working condition when it arrived at my house. The motor was not positioned properly. I called Dewalt and they really could not help me. I took the saw to a service center by my house. They worked on it, but it was still not right. I then put a spacer on the blade shaft. It now works. I do like the saw just wish it came in proper working order."
2,Fell apart in 3 months,"This is an aesthetically pleasing piece. The edge design allows birds of different sizes to easily get to the water level.However, there is one major problem: the connection between the leaf dish and the stake is not good. It rusted and broke after just 3 months of gentle use! I am still using the dish - I just put it on the ground between bushes. But now it mostly serves squirrels and opossums...There is another problem, this time with the design. To keep birds healthy, the dish needs to be washed every time prior to refilling it with water. The easiest way to do it would be to remove the dish. To accomplish it with this bath, one needs to unscrew the dish or the remove the whole thing from the ground. Both are quite cumbersome for a daily procedure. My advice is to buy the bath that has a dish which can be lifted from the base."
3,Matches made in video heaven.,"Back Cover description: If diehard bachelor Tyler Fortune was being forced by his parents to marry, he'd darned well do it on his own terms-even if it meant securing a bride through a dating service! Mousy Julie Parker seemed the perfect candidate. In return for becoming his wife, all the shy librarian wanted was a baby. And Tyler thought marriage wouldn't change his life much at all. Until his sweet bride had a glamorous makeover and they got down to making a baby the old-fashioned way....This would not happen in real life. It is an enjoyable story if you can get past the plot. Both Tyler and Julie grow and learn in this story. The reason I didn't give it 4 stars is that I hoped Tyler would call his parents bluff and Julie gets a new haircut/clothes and becomes beautiful."
5,Higher Quality than expected,"For the price, I thought this cable would be very thin like other cheap optical cables I have purchased. It is actually thicker and more substantial than I expected. Didn't have the cable attached covers like shown in some of the pictures, but covers are unnecessary in my opinion."
2,Major flaw,"First off, these work fine. Where the problem lies, is that when I plugged the cable in, it broke the little door that swings open in the optical port. This can be a major problem since that door is one wall of the port, and helps hold the cable in. It broke both the door on my cable box and my stereo."
4,good one!,a nice optical cable for a lower price..does it work very well...iam very much satisfied with the price and my purchase...
4,Take Caps off!,"Works fine, just take off the protective caps! Was not working at first....because I didn't remove the protective caps! I almost order a much more expensive one, but then I read another review....so yes take off the caps works perfectly!"
1,It's not male to male!,"I just receieved this cable, and one end is actually a TOSlink male end, but the other end is a 3.5 style male! it actually fits 3.5mm females.I will put up a picture of the ends, so you'll know not to get this and it will prove this cable will not work!"
2,Not As Pictured,"Cable received is not the cable in the photo. I received one with a much thinner cable, and end caps are not attached to the cable to prevent them from being lost. I posted a photo to this product's page."
5,Excellent cable,"Exactly what I purchased. I was initially concerned about the recent negative reviews when I placed my order but when I receive the product (very quickly), I realized those claims where baseless. Very happy with my purchase."
4,Great Cable,"This cable works great and the connectors fit securely into every port I have tried. The cable I received did not have the plastic protectors as shown in the picture. It instead had small plastic caps on either end. They protect just as well but I'm sure they will be lost soon. The cable is relatively thin and I would not trust it in high traffic areas. However, it works very well."
3,not sure if it even works,"In all honesty, I'm not great at audio equipment. I connected it to the components but I don't notice any difference. It could be working great and I not even know it."
5,Works Well,"The product is well constructed, clicks in the optical port well. Never had a chance to use it for sound, but the fact that the light emits through it means it works. Have it hooked up to my PS3. Great price."
2,not so good,I ordered this toy for my 6 month son. I gave him the toy. He was not interested. I tried to show him how to squeeze the squeaker but it was too hard. He dosen't like the toy because it dosen't do anything and the squeaker is too hard for him to push. It's great for him to throw or chew on. But other than that I wouldn't recommend it.
1,One of Lamaze's few not-so-great toys,"I've purchased virtually all the Lamaze toys for my baby (except for the Knottie Babies), but have found that this was one of the very few duds from a company that generally makes really great baby toys. The problem is that this toy doesn't really do anything. I know it's intended for newborns -- who don't do much of anything themselves -- but the star basically hangs there. The squeaker is too difficult for an infant to activate, and the toy's mirror is really tiny. If your infant needs something bright to capture his attention, I would suggestperhaps buying the wrist rattles and hanging those from his carseat, etc. Later on, those wrist rattles can be used for actual play as well. Skip this toy in favor of other Lamaze successes!"
1,In the toy box,I must agree with your other customer when she said this toy was a total dud. Like her I have bought toys from Lamaze and have found them to be most stimulating and fun for my little boy. When I read the description on the box it seemed like there was so much to do with the toy but I really don't know what they were thinking when they invented this toy as the squeezer is really too difficult for the baby to activate and even though I tried to point out the mirror or the patterns on the star by singing or shaking it there has not been a time where he showed any sign of interest. I bought the toy to hang on his stroller but it looks like I'll have to buy a more stimulating one!
2,My baby didn't like it,I have heard that Lamaze toys are excellent for babies but I felt this one was a waste of money. I think the star is quite heavy for a baby to play with and my daughter always picked up something that was lighter and easier to hold than this star. In the end I used in our car for her to look at while we were out and about. I'm not sure if it really held her attention - she always seemed to be attracted to other toys if given a choice.
3,"Great book, but not for beginners.","This book describes well all hardware-stuff, but there is missing all good 3d-stuff, like drawing polygons, shadings, and stuff like z-buffering, etc. It isn't very good for a beginners, because it describes well matrices and others, but it strangely jumps to a dot product,etc. that isn't described in the book, that requires some highschool-math."
3,This book is wonderful if you are a begginer.,"I came to this book after programming in C for about a year and I had just started learning game programming. As far as the 2d 13h section of this book, it is well written but you really have to have Borland's compiler, (DJGPP (gnu) is a better compiler). His 3d section suddenly becomes very confusing and impossible to grasp, not to mention useless today. (This book is out of date and is not his fault now.) The other sections of this book on general game programming are great, and the extra sections such as sound programming don't go into any detail and teach you basically nothing. This book was five stars in its time, but now is held back to three in modern times."
2,Maybe a good book if you are a beginner,"As a freelance programmer, i read the book and found nothing new, the information in the book is very basic, standard, and out-dated.i wouldn't recommend this book if you already know some things about game programming."
5,Great for starter and informative for customed,"This is one of my early book when i started to write game for fun. The technique discribe in the book isn't exactly up to date, but it's a good start. The book covers vast area that are needed to build a working game. It's a good book, if you want to get a hold on the basic, then you should buy this book."
2,"An excellent resource for beginners, yet seriously outdated.","This book provides you with the basics of game design, development, and 3d graphics. It seemed quite good until I reached the part on 3d graphics. It starts out talking about the many forms of 3d grahics engine, yet only discusses one, ray casting. It shows you how to make a Wolfenstein 3d type graphics engine, which was fine at the time the book was written, yet dosn't cut it anymore. It donsn't even touch z-buffering, lighting, fog, or any other particle affects, and dosn't give you a clue how to display any graphics that are up to todays standards. The bottom line is, good for beginners, but very outdated."
3,"oldies but goodies, but....","I don't really understand why people rate this book so high. I'm pretty new at game programming and I knew this book is old but I gave it a try anyway. Now, many portions of this books are useless in windows environment. (But as others stated it's not Andre's fault.) General concept of game programming is good. But, even I know it's not being used now, if there is one thing I should learn from this book, it should be ray casting engine. And I don't feel he was good at explaining that. It's possible becasue I read it traslated into Korean, but I felt I could explain it better and easier. Another gripe is that he basically omitted texture mapping section.(Or is it a matter of version again?) I felt I missed two most important things I wanted know. bottom line : Now, in 1999, you don't have to buy this book. Period. Some good infos the writer have are spreaded in all of his books. So, one book is enough."
5,Amazing.,"I bought this in my local drug store a few days ago, and I've only been using the product for 3 days. I can already see a difference in a 4 year old scar. Not much improvement (yet) in a couple of older scars, but I'm super impressed with the results I see so far."
4,its good,"it takes time for it to work, and it itches when u put it on ur face, donset smell great either, but it works, fades away some black spots from acne but it take time."
1,mederma scar gel,I do not see any difference on the C-section scar after having used the gel regularly for more than 3 months
5,Great for scars,"Had thyoid removed and use Medera everyday on small scar on my neck, seems to be working. Price is right, Walgreens wanted $29 amazed at price at amazon. Great purchase."
2,Not that all,we ordered it because we read that it helps out scars on face but it didnt work even little .
3,Does the job. But leaves another.,"This product does what it promises. It does fade scars. It just doesn't tell you what it leaves behind after that. This product burns your skin. Well, it does mine. It might be some kind of bleach that helps it fade scars because it surely burned me. Not burned like fire to your face now its black and torched, but it felt like it was on fire. It made the area red and puffy and it was extra sensitive for more than a week. You have to put it on 3 or 4 times in a day which is probably why it had a burning effect. Be careful if your using other products along with Mederma because it might and will cause some kind of reaction that you don't want. It's very watery. It's not a cream it's a step higher then water. It makes the area sticky afterwards and when it dries you'll get some white flakes."
3,"Mederma Scar gel, 20 grams","It was not the Mederma Advanced as pictured. It was the regular Mederma that you need to apply 3-4 times a day. I really wanted the once a day application because I am forgetful. Not much success with this product, but it wasn't used as directed."
4,I was skeptical...,"Thanks to an accident at the river I ended up with a large scar at my wrist. I have scars over most of my body so it didnt bother me. What did bother me is going to hand cashiers money and them looking down at my wrist and looking back up at me with that ""oh my he tried to"" looks. The mederma has smoothed the surface and reduced the red shade by 2/3 after 4 weeks. I'm going to continue using the product for another 4 weeks and see how much better it gets."
2,The gel is not as effective as the cream!,"I bought Maderma Scar Gel because I have noticeable scaring on my face that I want to get rid of. This product was horrible. The gel was sticky and so when I tried to rub into the skin it balled up and didn't absorb very well. Because of the fact that the gel is so thick, when I used it as recommended, it caused my skin to breakout due to the fact that the gel didnt allow my skin to breath. I will be sticking to Maderma cream from now on!"
4,works well but don't expect magic,"just a precursor, i only used it for about 2 weeks continuously. but it definitely makes a difference, whether it be small or big, it just depends on the type of scar. i used it for a dark bug bite scar and it lightened it up a bit. i'm not confident that it will completely disappear but i'm happy with what it has done so far."
4,Maderma,"Maderma is a product that works. It does take time for results to show, but be consistent with the usage and results will follow."
2,Did not help to reduce the look of my scar,"Simply did not help the look of my scar. Disappointing. I since read up on scar creams and found that the active ingredient is onion and the studies I read say onion does not work to remove scars. It said it works no better than petrtoleum jelly. Very upset I paid 24.99 for this. I have since found other scar treatments that have helped tremendously. Onion, seriously?"
4,Good Reference Work,"I read this as a title for a graduate class. It was difficult to read all in one sitting because there is so much information about so many different places. However, as a reference tool it is invaluable. Ever wanted to know what all the islands in the Pacific did for decolonization? Rothermund tells you. Some of his information is simplified and therefore slightly incorrect, but that is understandable in a sweeping work such as this. I am glad to have it on my shelf."
4,Good,Easy to install and does not cost as much as other filters. Works good so far but its one of those things where you can't really tell if its working or not! My water didn't smell like chlorine or anything before so I cant really compare it to that.
3,I'm a sucker,"Everything regarding the seller and shipping is great!, the only thing I don't like is the actual product. Don't notice any difference in water quality, and my chlorine meter reads nearly the same as well. Coulda saved a few bucks and just stuck it out and used plain old city water."
3,"Works, I guess","Works great on getting out chlorine, but I gave this a 3 star because this product leaks really bad. I've tried everything to install this correctly, even my neighbor who is a plumber came over to try and stop the leak but it still leaks. Which isn't good when your renting, because now I have water damage up the side of my wall almost onto my ceiling. It does what it claims, but buyer beware that it may leak"
2,Good at First,This filter seemed to work well at first. Doesn't leak and is half the price of the previous Johnathon Water Filter I was using. However I think it needs to be replaced far more often then recommended which becomes an expensive pain.
5,Good stuff,"I guess the biggest difference you could tell is when I shower, I put the water in my mouth, and it tastes just like the filter water that I drink, instead of tasting bitter or chemical.I use to live in this horrible dump of a slum farm in middletown in MD, and the water had so much iron in it, you had to run the water at least 10 minutes before the smell went away. But with this filter, that smell reduced significantly. Not all of it, but enough that I could bare. I moved out of that dump and went into a real apartment and it works great. With the high pressure shower head, I think it actually helps with the water pressure a little bit.Overall, it's worth the purchase. I don't think I could shower without one now."
4,sprite shower filter,works pretty good but does have a small leak showers are alot better now take the chlorine out of the water well.
4,Why Not,"I did not need the white housing for this filter as I was replacing the original filter that already had the housing......maybe I could have paid less for jut the filter? Anyway, think about a full year of showering in water laden with chlorine, absorbing into your skin, scalp and hair- then think about a year of showering with no chorline in the water. I choose no chlorine as it smells better, and without scientific evidence, I believe it is healthier- I have had problems with bumps on my scalp, and this filter seems to alleviate that problem.Who knows what happens to the chlorine absorbed into your skin? I don't, but I just like the idea of that not happening."
5,good filter works,"I have been using this filter for over a year, and I can tell a difference in the smell of the water. It is cleaner and no chlorine aroma anymore in my water. There is only and very slight slow down of the water pressure. But for some people who is having a problem with their water pressure, maybe its your shower heard, try replacing it with a better one. Or sometimes maybe the stuff in the filter is too squeezed up, slowing down the pressure, try removing the filter and shaking it a few time, or even reversing the front/back end occasionally."
3,Shower Filter,"In my case, it reduced the water pressure in GREAT measure. I have to spent twice the time taking a shower now. It also has a little problem controlling the temperature. Despite this, I feel the difference in the water."
5,Dry Skin Relief,My daughter recommended this product because I have skin allergies that create much itching and discomfort. I was reluctant to try yet another product but I finally did and what a relief - after only a week my skin is improving in looks and comfort. For those of us with skin problems - hurry and try the Sprite - it's worth every cent.
3,Too early to tell,Have been using the Sprite Shower filter for almost a month. Still too early to tell about its effectiveness. Certainly it has taken out some of the chlorine odor we have in our municipal water.
1,Waste of money!,"I am returning this tomorrow. It made my skin even drier than it was and made my hair disgusting. It was so dry and tangled I couldn't get a brush through it. I'm pretty sure this was the exact opposite of what was supposed to happen. I showered with it twice but the negative change in my hair made me take it off before I showered tonight. I am 25 with long healthy hair and it made it dull, lifeless and impossible to manage. What a mistake."
2,Sprite High Output Shower Filter,"Product slightly helps the dry patches on my arm. However, I can't tell if there is a big difference. If you can dish out the money to purchase a water softener for your home, I would much rather recommend that instead."
3,water filter,this one does the job but who knows if this really filters out all those bad chemicals not sure if I will rebuy this
5,Excellent so far,"We have hard water and this is working really well to remove the rust. My hair had taken a toll over time and it has already seen improvement over the last week. We don't mind the bit of rust everywhere else, but not so good over time in the shower.Suggestion to others looking to improve hair: Also replace the shower head. We found a lot of rust built up on the inside and saw more improvement after replacing that also. Also, use a clarifying shampoo after you've replaced both to get all the built up nasties out of your hair. For me, it seemed to make this filter all the more valuable!!I'll try to provide an update on longevity in a few months."
3,Say Goodbye to Chlorine,"These filters work great in getting chlorine out of the shower water. (Important for my diabetic skin!!) They are rated for 10,000 gallons. The filter in the housing can be replaced (a money saver). We replace it about every 6 months.My gripe is that it comes with teflon tape that is used to seal the connection and hubbie can never get it to not leak a bit.The plastic filter unit can crack over time (one of ours lasted about 1 1/2 years and the second about 4 years).The replacement filters should not be that expensive, in my opinion.No problem with the water pressure dropping very slightly. I hardly noticed it."
5,Just what I needed,Needed to replace longer version of the Firestone Air bags when I lowered the rear of my truck 2 inches. Worked like a charm!
5,Unmissable,"Ravel's fantaisie lyrique is an indisputable masterpeace and this unsurpassed first performance presents the music at its greatness. The singers, although with no stars, make an outstanding team and the mono recording (1947) conveys the voices very firmly. Warning: After listening to this CD you will try to get Ravel's L'Heure espagnole. You need not bother as not just it is not as imaginative as this opera, it also has a very strong declamatory line and there are no regular arias as on L'Enfant."
3,Fun if you like goofy humor,"This is a light-hearted but rather simplistic book. The characters are good-natured but not well-rounded, and the plot, such as it is (one long chase), depends primarily on the H & H's foolishness. I didn't hate it, but I did find it boringly childish, dependent on slapstick humor rather than wittiness and characters' enthusiasm rather than their intelligence. It's not badly written, so your enjoyment will depend mainly on what you find amusing. I just like more complexity in my humor."
5,A Truly Wonderful Tale,"This is great story about a boy in the old days of stagecoach travel in the 1830's in New Hampshire. Daniel Drew an orphan boy ends up working at a Deptford Tavern called the Fox and Stars, and the reader is treated to rich descriptions of what life was like back then before the automobile. Trouble stirs and Dan is involved in a hunt for an evil troop of highwaymen. This book is deep in adventure and I find it amazing that it is out of print. It is one of the best children's books I have ever read."
1,avoid,"stay away from this cable. i attempted to connect a laptop to a tv and it would not recognize the the output. so i then connected a dvd and we had green artifacting. switched to another cable, laptop and dvd both worked perfectly."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"I have to say that I wasn't sure about this product based on a previous review; however, I decided to give it a try and extremely happy that I didn't pay attention to the negative review. This product works perfectly with my MS Outlook and prints out daily pages for my day planner without having to separate them into single pages as indicated in the other review. I'm so thrilled with this product that I'm going to order another package. There are only two things that would make this product even better -- a heavier weight of paper and different colors."
1,Poor Quality,"If you possibly can, avoid this stock pot at all costs. The pot itself is cheap, poor quality, and lightweight which causes it to slide all over the burner. The lid is atrocious. Looks like and feels like it was made from recycled soup cans. As the previous reviewer mentioned the handles do get hot another indicator of poor design. There are much better choices."
4,One of my best purchase till date,"Hi,I purchased this product in 2007 & I believe it was one of my best purchase till date!I love video-graphy & this cam helps me capture everything crisply & clearly!!!Pros:-1> Hard disk storage (60GB)2> Great Zoom (25X)3> To some extent shock resistant (I did lost few clips due to shaking of the product)4> Perfect - ergonomically5> Battery does stay long enough & do not decay so fast (as compared to other products)Cons:-1> Loss of data if the product is shook badly (i.e. if it fells from your hand)2> Night mode capture is not that great3> Pictures taken are of very low quality (until it is shot in high sunlight)4> Wires (charging wires) dried out soon5> No/feeble image/video stabilization-Rajat"
1,This product has moving screen problem,"I have bought this product in 2007 and suddenly last year, it's screen is moving and I cannot record anything. I have checked on youtube and looks like it is a common problem. When I checked the cost of servicing, it is $211 dollars. It looks like Sony has a manufacturing or relaibility defect of this product. I am very disappointed."
4,Great camcorder...as long as you use the Sony software,"The capabilities of the camcorder make it a very good buy, but the largest downside is the files it creates require a special 5.1 Audio CODEC that Sony will not provide a version that works with other software like Winamp or Windows Media Player.The sad part is the 5.1 audio is lost with the built in microphone, but if I wanted 5.1 audio I would have purchased a different camcorder.The night vision works great for closer shots (10-foot max) because the infrared source only goes so far. If you are in low light situations, like Pirates of the Caribbean (see review titled ""Great camera for a great price"" by spongebob) it does work pretty good but not great.Given all the use this camcorder has seen in the past year, I would definitely buy it again along with the Sony NPFH70 battery pack."
3,Outstanding camera - if it works,"I purchased this videocam to record the birth of my first child. Unfortunately, when it arrived I had to return it. Straight out of the box, I encountered ""buffer overflow"" and ""data error"" messages after less than 3 minutes of recording. Reformatting the harddrive did not work, and Sony customer service was less than helpful. Eventually, I managed to return the camera and secure a working model - which I have used successfully.However, in the dark corners of my mind I will forever worry that the same errors will crop up in the replacement unit. For peace of mind, look elsewhere."
2,Poor DVD Quality,"I did not care for this product. The video looks great from Camcorder directly to TV. When I transferred the video to computer to DVD the quality was really fuzzy. I even called Sony tech support and they were unable to help. It was very frustrating and time consuming.Also, the lens cover does not automatically close when you turn off the camcorder."
5,Very good Camcorder,"Pros:This is my first camcorder and i am very happy i made the right choice. Excellent video and audio quality, very easy to operate, very decent photos and nice software to browse videos and photos on my computer. The camcorder is so small and fits perfectly in my palm, my friends hardly believed it is 60 GB and holds 21 hours of video.Cons:I wish there was some improvement on the battery duration as the battery on full charge comes for 90 Mins. Also the night mode shooting is not that impressive."
1,Terrible CamCorder,"I never review anything, but I felt I needed to make a review of this product. We purchased this camcorder just before Christmas. Normally Sony makes great electronic equipment, but this camera has been terrible from day one.For a long time I thought ""Well, maybe it needs perfect lighting"" or ""Maybe the boys were moving to fast"", but then I realized that our ancient camcorder - also a Sony - NEVER had a problem with these issues.This camera almost never focuses properly. It's off just enough that you rub your eyes thinking maybe its you, but its not. If you watch through the view finder, you can actually stand there and see the picture go in and out of focus - and I'm not even moving.I like the video to disk thing, but it's not worth much if you go to video you little boy's school play and get home to find everything is out of focus.It's up to you, but I for one would never spend anything on one of these cameras again."
3,"Good Item, But noprice diff on Thanksgiving day too",Item is good. But could not find any price difference though bought on Thanksgiving day.
2,Excellent Quality - but still big and bulky,"I really like the product and the output, but I wish the software was more helpful with the burning DVDs, making movies, and uploading smaller files. The files are HUGE. If you have the time, this is a good product. But it takes forever to do anything."
3,***COOL GADGET WITH FEW DISAPPOINTMENTS***,"I was very excited when I received this camcorders. It's the most convenient handicam I'd seen. very compact, and easy to manipulate. However, it just did not live up to my expectations or the hype I had heard. I noticed that the quality of the video, even in HQ setting is grainy and a bit washed off. To make things worse, in low light or indoor setting the video captured is very disappointing. You can see yellow and green spottings throughout the screen. Also, when you move the camara, the picture drags behind you. The voice quality is very poor. While you can hear the person taking video, you can barely hear the people you are trying to hear unless you are in a very quiet setting. I just didn't expect that one of the newest sony products out there would give me similar results as my panasonic camcorder that I had bought 10 years ago.. SORRY SONY, THIS ONE DID NOT LIVE UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS."
5,As fun as any great spy novel,"I read this book out of curiosity because I had once bought a house from the author. I thoroughly enjoyed A Secret Life. The book reads like Le Carre or any other good cold war spy novel. And, it is a fascinating, true story to boot. If you have any interest in how the spy game really worked behind the Iron Curtain, if you want to learn about a little known, but as it turns out, hugely important and courageous Polish general who contributed to the fall of Eastern Bloc, I recommend this without reservation."
3,Funny and entertaining,"If you, like me, believe that society has gone way out on a limb with the obsessive need for political correctness, then I highly recommend this humorous and witty book.I laughed at the tale of Rudolph The Nasally Empowered Reindeer who started a union because of Santa's exploitation of male/buck reindeer and vertically challenged elf populations.Frosty the Persun of Snow gathered a crew of fellow snow persuns and marched on Washington, DC to protest global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer.The author has a wonderful way of poking fun at all the political correctness done in the name of good intentions."
2,meh,"Retellings of ""Frosty"", ""Rudolph"", ""A Christmas Carol"", and ""The Nutcracker"" with PC speak and a snarky attempt to be ""inoffensive"", as in, without religious or judgmental tones. Rudolph starts a union, Frosty fights against global warming, etc. Not really particularly funny or meaningful. Very meh. Grade: C"
4,The Most Amazing Book! A Review By Rylei,"In Roald Dahl's The Witches a young 7-year-old boy named Luke has to live in a hotel in England. Soon, Luke goes into a ball room to train his mice, and it suddenly gets filled with WITCHES! He wants to escape, yet he gets turned into a mouse! Read to see how Luke plans to get his revenge. Will his plan work? Will he get caught? Read to find out!I really loved this book. I recommend this book for people who are on an intermediate going on to advanced reading level. This book was very suspenseful. I liked when Luke was turned into a mouse, it kept me at the edge of my seat. I loved that it had lots of magic like when Luke could still talk when he was a mouse. If you are looking for a suspenseful and action-packed read... this is the book for you!"
2,Thompson's literary equivalent of a Who reunion tour.,"Just like other rock n' rollers of his time, Thompson has served up a watered-down version of his original intensity. Thompson heaps his usual amount of scorn on the deserving pols of the '92 campaign, but he doesn't give us the real feel of what was out there. This is probably because most of the book seems to center on faxes he received and finding a way to use the word ""bubba"" on every page. Thompson used to put substance behind his politician roasts. Now he just roasts.Pete Townsend used to lose chunks of flesh off his fingers as he played guitar. He is too old for that type of thing now and the Who aren't as good because of it.In much the same way, Hunter S. Thompson has opted to stay at home next to his fax machine instead of putting his teeth to the asphalt and giving us the wonderful literary journalism he may or may not be capable of putting out anymore"
2,"A failed attempt to rekindle the spark of ""...Campaign '72""","Normally, a new release from the Good Doctor is cause for intense celebration; indeed, that was the mindset I had when I first read this work. Sadly, the party turned into a wake about one third of the way through.It is a limp look at the Presidential campaign for 1992; mainly reproductions of faxes, a lot of inside jokes and just the lightest smattering of the Famous Thompson wit. The saving grace is the Tribute to Richard M. Nixon...I'm not sure if that's worth the price of admission, though.Certainly for dedicated Thompson fanatics. Others would do well to checkout the classic ""Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas"", ""Songs of the Doomed"" or ""Hell's Angels"".Don't worry, though, doc...I'm still counting on you to come through with 1997's opus. See you in September, or in jail. I'll bring the whiskey."
4,Still makes you throw your head back and laugh,"It is crude, straight to the point and sometimes very cruel. But thats life isn't it ! It will be remebered for how to teach you chirldren Nixon and Mr. Clintons eating habits"
3,And you're no Jack Kennedy,"OK, so sex is not what it used to be, and Dr. Thompsonis getting older, but has sex really sunk below politicsamong the guilty pleasures? For shame. Dr. Thompson opensa vein for us on the titanic '92 battle of Clinton and Bush,which is not exactly the same Good and Evil slugfest as lastseen in his '72 classic of McGovern vs. Nixon (Fear andLoathing on the Campaign Trail). But Dr. T. can still workup a feeble flow of bile for both Billy-Bob Clinton andGeorgie-Porgie Bush. But be warned, Stephanopolous isno Maurice Stans either. Dr.Thompson, please, gather yourbile and let loose, the evil is crawling up your shirt,stamp it out in '96!"
2,What Happened Gonzo?,"I was drawn to this book after having read ""Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail of '72,"" expecting to find a similar tale of '92. Alas, I was sadly disappointed. If ever there was a candidate to take aim at, it was Bill Clinton but for some mystical reason, Thompson let him drift out of his sight. Strange, since Thompson let no one escape his unmerciful eye in '72."
3,"Boring Race for the Election, Futile Attempt","I was in college during the Clinton/Bush campaign of '92. I was rash and following the economic collapse of the Mid-west following the Reagan years was ready to vote for anyone but Bush. I was interested in the campaign and the book brought back many memories from my studies of it at the time. It also reminded me how little actually happened. This is where the book is untimetly doomed. HST tries his best to inflect some humor, charisma, and turmoil into the electoral process but in this case there is just too little to mine. The first true ""Anti-election"" also spawned the first very average HST book."
4,Still Gonzo After All These Years...,"Let me start by saying that if you have never read anything by Dr. Thompson before, do not start with this book. Rather, start with some of his earlier material (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or one of his many articles for Rolling Stone).I don't recommend this book to first-time Thompson readers because it is so disjointed that the reader, without knowing Thompson's style, may give up on Thompson before discovering his other great writings.This is not one of Doc's greatest books, but its entertaining, none the less. Its almost worth it just for the funny pictures/faxes and the vicious jabs thrown at all of the canidates.I rated this book with four stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I enjoyed it so much because I am a Thompson fan and eat up almost everything he writes. Other people, however, would be better off starting with something written a little bit earlier in Thompson's career."
3,Gonzo Political Coverage,"Dr. Thompson's coverage of the election of the first rock `n roll president is a hoot and a half. From a hapless George Bush reeling from the loss of strategist Lee Atwater (RIP) to smooth Bill Clinton's hustling his way into the voter's hearts and minds, Thompson was a fly on the wall for it all.Thompson went out of his way to make himself a part of the whole story, whether anyone wanted him to or not. It's clear by many of the memos and faxes reproduced here, many didn't. But that's part of the fun. Thompson can make politicians wiggle on the hook like no one else can.Better Than Sex is a fantastic time capsule of the 1992 presidential campaign--even predicting that women just might be Clinton's downfall. Included also is an unkind obituary for former President Nixon and the legacy he left behind.The book is subtitled `Confessions of a Political Junkie' and it is required reading for any political junkie."
5,HSTs Most Scathing Pol Journal Yet!,"In reading Better Than Sex, I found a calmer, older & wiser HST. A writer more astute to the 21st Century realities of politics and a writer tired of traveling. It seems as if HST wrote this book just for the fun of it (and he does have fun...probably his funniest work to date); rather than trying to meet a deadline, craming pages into the Mojo Wire as the book is being printed. This book is especially poignant now that we see with the hindsight of the Clinton presidency and of the political realities of the late 1980s and early 1990s. This is a great companion read with Primary Colors by Anonymous; a combination I created by accident.In short, I was skeptical of this book, but as a card-carrying Hunter-Head, I gave it a chance. As a result, I've found my new favorite (Non-Fiction) HST book. ""When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro."" Selah."
2,"okay, BUT TRUST ME, GET IT AT A CHEAP PRICE!!!!!","Great to unlock 5 or 6 quick pointless minigames but the game is weird.I was expecting a cool platformer/party that you would want to play multiplayer. But The multiplayer mode always breaks on my ds! ( I sware brand new ds no scratches, nothing!)I like the idea of changing elements, and even the poor graphic looking granny helmet, but all in all let me show you my opion:Pros* minigames don'tsuck but don'trock either* gameplay makessense, kind ofCons* I like the ""raving rabbids""to be devilishly cute like thewii version,(which still doesn't have a good example of what i'm saying)but this version they look happishly evil and theweird graphics ruins the feel* platforms are tinier than the character!* litterally, all you can see is the projectile the enimiesALWAYS hit you with and you always die randomlyBut with all this negativity I guess the game wasn't a COMPLETE waste, because it is a fun way to pass time....."
1,Returned it,My 8 yr son didn't care for this game at all. He said it was boring and hard to play. I didn't question him as he is the DS expert in the house. So we returned the game.
3,"OK rack, a couple of shortcomings.","Have had my rack 6 months. It is reasonably well made and sturdy. Bikes go on easily. The rubber frame holders work well with my hardtail bikes. A couple of bungees or the included strap should keep your bikes from swinging; you don't need the struts or fancy clamps.Two problems: first, the locking-bolt hole for the 1-1/2 inch bar is too close to the end, causing the bar not to fit all the way into the receiver (poor design) and making the rack stick out at least 3 inches farther than it should on my car (Subaru Forester). Why not have two holes, like my old Saris rack? I had a machinist drill and tap another hole in the correct position. The Thule customer service (joke!) people would never admit this design flaw, although their website addresses it.Second, to fold or unfold the crossbars (that the bikes go on), you have to remove/replace a bolt with a nylock nut, requiring 2 wrenches. This should be a tool-free affair with a carriage bolt and a big wingnut."
3,"Decent rack, replace the straps, have a wrench handy","This is a quality rack. Biggest complaints:1. I have a couple bikes with wierd bulky frames (sq tubes, shocks/springs in the way), causing me to stretch the stubby stock straps to mount the bikes. When you use the rubber straps (on any car rack), they should only be snug but NOT STRETCHED or you can lose a bike. I know, happened twice, watched it happen the second time and saved the bike. So I bought longer Yakima ""Replacement Rubber Straps for Yakima Bike Racks w/SwitchBlade Cradles""; neither Thule (nor Amazon) have any so bought them from [...], [...]. Twice as long w/ round holes but they work. Warning: Even so, don't trust just the straps, buy a ""12 foot lashing strap"" (w/ easy clamp) and wrap it around the rack and bikes and cinch it down: [...].2. The rack mount on the hitch is goofy, requiring a wrench. I guess it tightens it all up though. Might want to get the lock for it."
3,A little disappointed,"The 956 Rack that was sent had not been properly machined so the parts would not line up to receive one of the bolts. The rack was effectively a really large paperweight! After looking a little closer, the part that goes into the car's receiver was also screwed up a little but functional.Thule customer service was really polite and told me that I could ship it back and then they would send me a replacement. This probably would have worked if our family was not 700 miles from home on vacation...sigh.Stuff happens, I guess. Off to find a hardware store and fudge the job. I'll machine it when we get home.Other than a little quality control issue and some poor timing... the rack is okay and not a bad buy for the money."
2,Not quite right,"Had this rack for 5 years and just sold it at a garage sale for 50$. Well built and sturdy, but way too heavy and awkward. Even though made for 4 bikes, 2 mountain bikes nearly filled it. Mountain bikes frames, especially those with full suspension do not fit well at all. Three bikes was a chore to cram on with pedals and handle bars interfering with each other. Requires bungees to secure the bikes from swinging and handle bars from turning and banging into each other. The rubber supports for the bikes were difficult to fit the tight frame of suspension over. Many comments about the hitch bolt. The reason there is a bolt on the hitch and not a pin is to tighten the rack so it doesn't wiggle around in the receiver. I had the Thule lock on the hitch bolt which worked well although it is hard to get to in the tight spaces between the bumper and the receiver. Storage of the rack when not on the car is also awkward as it is very heavy and ungainly to hang or set against a wall."
4,It's me not the product,I'm pleased with the product although I am missing an endcap on the upright/bike arm assembly. My only problem has been getting my bike strapped down. I have an older model TREK bike that is very heavy and the bars are bigger around than the newer models. Other than that I am very pleased with my Thule hitch mount rack.
2,Not totally happy,"I was excited when i opened the box and installed it, was not happy to see that the arms that holds the bike can't be lowered down, you have to remove the bolt before you can do it, some models is just press and two arms goes down."
4,Good but not great - but some easy upgrades,"Hate the fact that I had to pay a ton extra for the Thule lock but other thoughts:1. Definitely buy something like: www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054ZQL36/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00 to make this easily convertible into a fold down unit. Super simple.2. I don't have a ton of experience w/ bike racks and not much to compare but it is not easy to get kids bikes onto these racks. My bike (35+ yr old male) fits perfectly but my son's 20"" and my daughters toddler bike w/ training wheels make it a bit more complex.NOTE: Got the 4 bike and 2"" hitch but ultimately roughly total of $200 for a 4 bike hitch carrier that folds down and locks isn't so bad.Just feel like Thule can offer a better product."
3,Not as easy as I had hoped,"It will hold four men's bikes easily, unfortunately this was a family purchase so four bikes isn't as easy with the various shapes of kids' and women's bikes. To fit all four I ended up having to buy additional cross bar adapters.You can pull a pin to tilt the entire rack down but to lower the main arm you have to remove a bolt and nut. My plan is to install a pin there to make that easier and from other reviews it sounds like I can do that after drilling the hole a little larger."
3,It works,"I have the 2 bike version. Positives? Easy and quick to put a bike on it. Bikes seem stable. Fold away mechanism is easy to operate. Negatives? Installation on hitch requires a bolt...could be easy for someone to steal the whole assembly. I use a hitch lock on my hitches and hitch cover...doesn't work with this bike rack making attaching and detaching a chore (you have to have a wrench or socket). Also, the rubber mounts holding the bikes move which is nice for setup, but they also move slightly while driving (wind pressure hitting the bike tires). Positives outweigh the negatives though."
2,Thule Parkway,This rack is pretty cool. It holds four bikes. Then you read more and find out that it holds four men's bikes..... and you have a wife and two daughters. Then it kind of sucks.
3,Pretty good,This rack easily holds 4 bikes safely. We drove from Pa to Cape May to Rehoboth Beach and back. No problem.The 1 (big) problem is that the rack doesn't fold down while on the vehicle. So the arms stick out a couple of feet. So we had to return it for one that does fold.
5,Sometimes older is better...,"Amazing performances of both works...once again Testament gets it right...and no weak part of the programme...OK, the sound isn't perfect, but we're talking 1950 here...don't let that scare you...the Schoenberg is scary/atmospheric enough...Penguin top 100 Guide is right on here."
5,More successful than expected,"I bought this book for my son as it was recommended reading in his homeschool program. My son is not really ""into"" books but he really loved this one. He loved it so much that he wants to learn more about Vincent Van Gogh and see more of his works. (My son is only 7.)This book is a great way to introduce your kids to Van Gogh and several of his most popular works."
3,Mixed reactions to this book...,I thought the illustrations were well executed. The graphicreference to Vincent's suicide would be upsetting to younger children.Why should his suicide be mentioned at all? He left a legacy ofbeauty. END
4,SuperbSunflowers,This is a great stroy for young children. It gives good insight into the life of VanGogh at a child's reading and interest level. The illustrations are great. It is a great lead into an art lesson.
4,Camille and the Sunflowers,"This book has beautiful pictures and a nice story. When ordering I did not realize that this edition is extremely large (about 14"" x 17"") and is way too big for a home library. It would be much better in a classroom situation where a teacher can hold up the book and all the children will be able to see the pictures. There are study questions included. I returned this book and purchased a smaller edition that is now called Van Gogh and the Sunflowers but is the same story and pictures."
4,a good starting point,"This is a very well written and illustrated story about a young boy who encounters Vincent Van Gogh and befriends him. It is based on a true story. While it is well done and my children love the story, I was a little bit disappointed that it included only imitations of Van Gogh's paintings and not actual pictures of them. I felt that even though there is a sad element to this story, the author did an excellent job of making it suitable even for small children, and sparks their interest in learning more about his life and works. We will be using this book this year for our homeschooled kindergartner and preschooler, and I am sure that this will be a great starting point for further learning and discussions. I give this book four stars and highly recommend it."
4,Scornful Fun,"What I love about this book is the unbridled rage towards poets and academia. Weinstein is full of hate and rage -- the good kind. I couldn't put this down. Funny and in its own way, wise. I just hope it doesn't get reviewed by some pompous poet or stick-up-his-(rear) academic. This will be a cult classic."
4,Thoroughly wonderful,"Weinstein captures not only the life of a budding writer in the world of academia well, she also hits all the right notes in the relationship between her narrator and the poet Z. It's an engrossing book that's hard to put down and I was impressed with the fresh and sly tone of the entire story. Although the conclusion is appropriate, I wished for more and would've liked just a few more twists and turns before having to close the book. Still, this is one of the better novels I've read in the last few years and I highly recommend it."
5,Exposing Academia,"Debra Weinstein has written a fresh and funny tale of the misuse of an undergrad assistant by her famous poet professor. Takes place in the 80's before computers, so we can assume that academics no longer take advantage of their brilliant young students by picking their brains!!! Seriously, this is an entertaining and charming first novel."
5,Rate Diabetic Dog Treat,Dog loves them. Great replacement from her regular treats before she became diabetic. Our dog also got SARDS which left her blind. She is 10 years old and other wise in good health. So this product really helps her quality of life.
1,not a toy!,"I bought this as a doll for my daughter, but it really is meant to just be a decorative piece. The doll is supposed to stay atop the stand, and the stand is supposed to rotate, and play music. It doesn't rotate consistently, and when it does it goes soooooooo slowly, one can barely tell it's actually moving. The worst part is that the seller kept it somewhere smokey, so the product, and the box STINK of stale cigarette smoke."
3,Ok at first but gets boring.,When I first bought this game I was really addicted to it for a whole week then after that it just got boring.I liked the fact that you could mix animals together but there were some flaws that I could see.When playing a game there is a high demand to be fast about making your army.The random map mode is very hard I have not won once since I bought this game.(...)
4,GREAT TOY BUT KEEP OUT OF THE TOY BOX:,THIS TOY IS GREAT WITH IT'S COLORS AND NOISES THAT EACH RING MAKES. WHAT I REALLY LIKE IS THAT THE BASE IS ALL ONE SIZE SO THE CHILD CAN PLACE ANY RING ON AND THEY ALL STACK UP NO MATTER WHAT THE ORDER. WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE TOY IS THAT THE BASE CAN EASILY GET BENT. AND SOMETIMES MY DAUGHTER HAS A HARD TIME GETTING THE RINGS ON BECUASE IT BENDS SO EASILY.
3,"Attractive, Safe, But Could Be More Stimulating","My infant likes the rings, but the noises each one makes is too muted or hard to activate for her to keep-up interest. It would also have been even more clever if there was some visual or auditory reward when each ring is placed on to the spindel itself. Otherwise, the only way the baby builds up an interest to try placing the rings on the spindel is by having me demonstrate it over and over and over again and then coaxing her to try it. Nevertheless, I would recommend this toy because it is both attractive and safe, and does allow for some fun interaction. END"
3,Where's my squeak?!,"All the reviews talk about the sounds the toy makes and my daghters just rattles and crinkles. Actually only one crinkles and the rest rattle. Nevertheless this toy is OK. It is soft and small so it doesn't take up much room and it doesn't hurt if you step on it! Other than that there is nothing to say about it, it's nothing special."
5,#5025 model from Polar Lights,"The item for sale here is Polar Lights kit #5025, Original sculpt kit, premiere release, and this box was on the market in 1999. If someone is selling it here new, it is from unsold stock, and very rare. Nice kit, comes with paper instruction, all parts, and ready to be painted. It has some parts that are already chromed. As finished it is 8 1/2"" in height. Robby is from the 1956 movie ""Forbidden Planet"". There is a newer version of this robot in a model kit released recently, but I prefer this classic style look and box and am glad you can still find it at Amazon."
5,A very different and great aproach to Yoga,I love this book. It is one of a kind. Easy to use. There are 12 spiritual muscles to work with. You can use the book in the order you wish. The author encourages you to make your own yoga posture. A treasure of a book.
2,Pass on purchasing this book,I bought this book because one my friends told me about it and it seemed like the plot would be interesting. NOT!! First of all the book was dragged out far too long. I wanted the problems resolved quicker than they were. A lot of characters were left somewhat undeveloped and the book just seemed to be about a black man realizing he was gay which isn't exactly a genre that I am interested in. Perhaps if this subject was presented differently it may have been more enjoyable. If you still feel you must read this book borrow it from the library or a friend.
2,I Don't Think So,"Although I did find this book entertaining and somewhat hard to put down,it was only because I was reading just to find out what happened. Harris just tells a story. Nothing spectacular; hiswriting is far from intriguing. I even hated most of the characters; all of them, except for the angelic Zurich,were extremely self absorbed and had too many unrealistic 'secrets.' This book should have been published under a black 'harlequin' label, and Harris should hardly be acknowledged as a literary genius. For the readers who feel this is the best book you have ever read--I feel sorry for you that you have not been exposed to mind blowing literature.Do not limit yourself to Harris' drivel."
3,"Caution, Agendas Ahead!","This is my first Harris novel and wasn't sure what I was in for. I really appreciated getting a black perspective on life and found the topic of homosexuality an interesting twist. However, the agendas that being gay is biblically acceptable as well as the idea that you can be convinced that you are gay are definitely visible. (If your twin brother is gay then you must be gay too. How just is it to feed on someone's self-doubt and insecurity?.) In real life Zurich would have been straight. I had to roll my eyes at the ending. No doubt it couldn't have ended any other way with the agendas presented. Read with caution if you are straight. Definitely a fairy-tale for gays. No pun intended."
2,And this too should have passed,"I wasn't feeling this one. I couldn't get into any of the characters. I assumed this book would answer some of the questions left from the other. Instead, it started with a whole group of new characters with what I felt, was an unbelievable storyline. Mia, who no one in their right mind could feel sorry for, or like for that matter, Tamela, who acts like a spoiled brat after finding the perfect guy, then Sean, who wasn't ""man enough"" to tell Zurich how he felt, instead ""acting like a little girl."" Then there was MamaCee and all of her faith. I just wasn't feeling it.The one thing I'm starting to feel is that Harris must have had a thing for his own version of Basil, because I can't understand how he, of all characters, continues to pop up, and every man that comes in contact with him finds him irresistable. GIVE ME A BREAK! I think this is Harris's feelings for someone in his past. I kept saying... Why Basil? What is up with that Harris?"
3,Shall pass,I always admired E.Lynn Harris's book. This one was good. But I enjoyed his first two a little more.
4,it flows easily and the characters were seemingly real,"I thought the book introduced some important aspects in the reality of gay life and the thoughts that progress in the minds of the real people and how they deal with their problems, lifestyles, and the loves in thier lives. Mr. Harris keep the feelings real and made the reader much more intuned with the characters by being able the empathize."
2,One of the more disappointing books I have read.,"After hearing all the ""hype"" I decided to buy this book and I was quite disappointed. I felt the book was written based on a formula, i.e., A will lead to B which will cause C to happen and will end up with a conclusion of D. It was very predictable and I found myself wanting to change the entire ""story line"" of the book. I did find ""Just As I Am"" to be of more interest, however I read it AFTER ""And This Too..."" which made me even more disappointed with it. I tried to read ""Invisible Life"" AFTER ""Just As I Am"" but was angry because Mr. Harris killed off my favorite character, ""Kyle"" so I just couldn't get into it, knowing what was going to happen to him. While I would not give it a ""10"" I felt ""Just As I Am"" was a better book. I have not been inclined to read Mr. Harris's current book, ""If This World Were Mine"" after browsing through it in the bookstore. I feel it is more or less for the 21 and under age group and not my age group, 40 and over."
3,This novel was no where near as well-written as the others.,"I thought that the novel was extremely predictable. It was also a little too unrealistic that so many of the characters ended up being gay. I loved ""Invisible Life"" and ""Just As I Am,"" and I look forward to his latest, but ""And This Too Shall Pass"" was a big disappointment"
5,Wonderful book. A definite must read-for everyone.,"This was the first book that I ever read by E. Lynn Harris-and it was totally by accident. I was in a bookstore when I saw the book. I had never heard of Harris. I decided to take a chance on the book and I've been reading his novels ever since. He is a skillful master of articulation. Thanks so much for allowing me the chance to become a part of the lives of your characters. It was a wonderful experience. The newest novel ""If This World Were Mine"" is just as wonderful as all the rest."
4,Harris just doesn't disappoint you,"Mr. Harris is a very good writer, and I enjoy almost every book that he wrote. I like seeing all these intricate dynamics into the macho and supposedly all straight world. Also, I really like the romance in it. All in all, it's a good read and I would recommend it."
4,And This Too Shall Pass is a powerful piece of fiction,"And This Too Shall Pass by E.Lynn Harris is a powerful and thoughtful look into the intracacies of African American love in the late nineties. Harris accomplishes this through four vivid and realistic characters who all experiece their share of joy and pain throughout the course of this moving story. Harris is particularly effective in the areas of figurative language and social commentary. Harris' great descriptive ability shines through in the potent and overwhelming sexuality in the novel. Readers should be advised that homosexuality is a major theme in this book and may be offensive. Overall, this is a rousing success for E.Lynn Harris."
5,Another Great Book by E. Lynn Harris,I think the author does a great job developing characters that seem real and believable. It's amazing how the plot thickens as you finish each chapter. MamaCee is such a great person!
3,I failed to see what the uproar was about. Good reading.,"I like reading the book but I did not see the substance.. Althoug Harris is a very good story teller and writes with a great deal of feeling, I am inclined not to reccomend this book for young adults. Was it just me or did the stories in the book validate the confused state homesexual people are in?"
3,Can't Relate,"Being a former athlete and a current sports enthusiast I dove right into this book anxious to read a storyline with characters I could relate to. The story was fast and easy reading until I read the first romantic scene...male and female. It didn't ring true. Something was missing. As I read further and it dawned on me what was happening I had to force myself to finish the book. Reading one mans lustfull description of another mans physique left me noxious. Mr. Harris did an excellent job of developing the characters and it is a good story but I'm sorry, men lusting men is just plain disgusting."
3,NOT THE BEST,BEING THAT U HAVE 2 READ ALL OF E LYNN BOOKS IN ORDER U HAVE NO CHOICE BUT 2 READ THIS 1 IF UR GOING 2 CONTINUE WITH OTHERS OR UR GOING 2 B LOST. THIS WAS THE WORST 1 THOU NOT A BAD BOOK IT WAS NOT THE TYPICAL EXCITING PAGE TURNING BOOK. I GUESS E LYNN HIMSELF NEEDED A BREAK :-)
5,"Sexy, funny, and refined",My favorite of Harris' work. He reaches a new height with this story.I loved the characters! This is a must read!
5,I found this book to be very diversified to the black race.,This novel was a very good passtime enjoyment. It helped me to picture different lifestyles within the black community. It also let me identify with some of my own needs and insights concerning different beliefs and attitudes in my race.
4,Good work,"The most rewarding part of this book begins in section 2. I understand that the theory part creates the base analysis, but I have to say that the reader will understand the models without reading section 1. Not so profoundly, but good enough to grab the idea of this book. If you are in a hurry, skip section 1.All in all, this book is an excellent book for those who want to understand the structure of mobile industry and the way it is evolving. Mr. Vesa has done good work in capturing the characters of a dynamic and constantly evolving industry. Though, this book is published in this year, some of the information of this book is already outdated; this tells much about the dynamic nature of mobile industry.Great book!"
2,Not their best,"Inkubus Sukkubus is one of my FAVOURITE bands. They are absolutely wonderful, and I listen to them EVERY DAY. I was thrilled to have stumbled upon them. Since then, I have shared their enchantment with a few friends who also agree they are fantastic.HOWEVER, with utmost respect to the group, this is not one of their best albums. I find myself only listening to two songs on here: Samhain and Belladonna. Many of the songs sound similar to one another, without their usual unique ring to them. I STRONGLY encourage you to check out a different album of theirs. Personally, I enjoy ""Wild"" - it is much more true to how good they really are. If you have never heard Inkubus Sukkubus before, check out the ""Wytches & Vampyres: The Best of Inkubus Sukkubus"" album - you'd be getting the Belladonna & Aconite song on there, too!"
5,Better than expected,"It's a book that isn't in print any more and the quality said ""good"" or ""fair"" so I wasn't expecting much, but when I got it the book was in almost pristine condition. There was a single scuff on the cover, but other than that no pages are even creased."
5,HackMaster Basic and Advanced HackMaster,HackMaster was a great game lot's of fun. Be aware there is a new and completely revised edition of the game now from the same publishers.HackMaster Basic was released a few months ago. Check it out!
4,I want to get it...,"I want to get this thing a lot. Part of it is that it seems like fun, also that I'd enjoy seeing some of the stuff in here since it can be converted to 2nd edition etc. My group refuses to play though because I found the field guide and after I mentioned leperosychauns they said that they would not play."
3,book Review,I am reading this book now. Parts of it are useful. the book describes a lot of feelings and observations but the process of her spiritual practices are not detailed. It would be fairer to describe them as a series of essays documenting her personal observations.
4,Microsoft Works software,"The Microsoft Works software worked fine and was exactly what it was advertized to be. I am happy.Thank you,Jay Nelson"
3,Works 7,"I ordered this to actually replace Works 4.5.7 does not have the feature, as far as I can see, to load up files automatically when opening. 7 just opens one at a time.I went back to 4.5.Thanks,PercmanDotCom"
1,MS Works 7.0,I had to upgrade to MS Works 7.0 due to Y2K issues. I am not nearly as satisfied with MS Wortks 7.0 as I was with MS Works 4.5. I am now searching for a replacement.
4,"Under-rated, over-criticized","I have used MS WORKS from about the time it was born, when it was quite primitive and sometimes unstable. But I have continued to use it, primarily for databases, because it has become progressively more stable and easy to use. These are not all small and simple databases--many include several thousand items, each with 20 to 30 fields of data. It is easy to ""find"" single items or to assemble groups of items (""filter""), and to print customized reports. So if you don't need (or want) the super sophistication of ACCESS, I have found WORKS to be a friendly and helpful--and inexpensive--alternative."
4,"Very Nice, Very Cheap","I put MS Works on all systems that I make for other people. It has everything they need, and it dosen't break the bank. The only thing I don't like is that there is no Presentation software, or PowerPoint clone. Then again, if they included that, MS Office sales would go down A LOT!!!"
3,I'm On This Album...,"Peace. I want to start by saying, only underground heads 21 and over will respect this album because most of you punks don't know who Erick is anyway. Although, it's not one of his greatest efforts, it still shows as a pioneer he surpassed many of his peers. Furthermore, I'M ON THIS ALBUM. I kept it real by rating it a 3. Sy Scott is one of the illest up and coming emcees in the field. Check Lyricist Lounge II for further reference. And as far as I'm concerned, until you sit down and write a rhyme instead of email chatting, you can kiss...[off]. Just playin. I love ya'll. HIP HOP LIVES!!"
3,aaaaiiiiiggggggghhhhhhhhhtttttt,"Its a Good album if ure more of a old skool fan, i'm a new skool fan so I wasn't really feelin it. But with guests like Slick Rick ,Too Short and Xzibit its listenable to me"
5,"Sam, as ""Always"" the best","I've been a Sam Harris fan and supporter for 20 years. I've watched and listened to him grow as a singer and performer. This 2 CD is nothing short of his best at touching your soul. His versions of ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"", ""Wind Beneath My Wings"", ""Get Here"", and""Love Me Tender/Always"" are vintage Sam. He knows how to take your emotions to various places. If you're looking to complete your collection of Sam Harris music. Don't hesitate tobuy it. If you've heard about Sam's performances on the Oprah show, be prepared to be blown away. ""Always"" is a 2 disc set that you'll be listening for Always.RickOshkosh, Wisconsin."
5,Sam Harris - Always - A 5-STAR review!!!,"Sam Harris just keeps getting better and better. I love the arrangements of all the songs he sings and the mix of songs on this CD! Sam is fabulous and if you ever get a chance to see him perform live, do not miss it! You can hear his soul in every song he sings. Do not miss this CD!"
5,Simply the BEST!!,This CD personifies Sam Harris at his best. The wonderful piano accompaniment compliments his powerful voice. I highly recommend this CD set; a MUST for any Sam Harris fan.
3,Dispensable,"Sam Harris has a pleasant and agreeable, but not a great voice. (Although he can sing a lot better than I can). As I listened from track to track, I kept thinking, ""His version is okay; but 'so-and-so"" does it better."" So while Mr. Harris sings in a very committed and sincere manner; I cannot, in all honesty, recommend this set to the casual listener."
3,Disappointing,To be fair- I haven't listened to the whole CD- mostly because I was disappointed with the songs I did hear. Sam's voice was very mellow- not at all showcasing the breath-taking long high notes reminiscent of Over the Rainbow.
2,"Elevator Music (that does not ""elevate"" anyone)!","He is soooo bland (from his looks to his voice to his arrangements) that he actually manages to completely suck the life and charm out of many great songs, turning them into a puree of non-offending, crowd-pleasing but deadly boring experience...I don't know why this guy isn't more mainstream...he certainly deserves to be heard in every Wal-Mart of the world!"
4,Bare Bones,"This book is exactly what it says and nothing more. It is an extremely concise development of tensor math. It is only basic in the sense that it has no frills, for it covers several advanced topics. (Riemannian space, Lie derivative, and the Riemann-Christoffel tensor to name a few)If you are trying to learn tensors for the first time I wouldn't recommend this as a first book. It will tell you the bare bones of how tensors work without examples or problems along the way to check your understanding.This is not a bad thing if you already have some working knowledge of tensors and want a succinct review. For that purpose this is a great no-nonsense treatment of the subject."
4,Good Reference Book,"This is an excellent little reference book. It is divided into very short chapters with each chapter devoted to a single concept. At the end of each chapter there is usually a white space where you can jot additional notes. I first learned tensors from Schaum's ""Tensor Calculus""; I covered them again in Schutz's ""A First Course in General Relativity"". Oeijord's book is a great summary of what I have learned and has a good index for quickly finding and reviewing a concept. Add to this my notes in his white spaces and I have a great piece of reference material on tensors. On the other hand, I would not try to learn tensors from this book; the explanations are lacking and there are virtually no examples or problems to work."
1,very upset,i received my package and once it was opened i got 6 pages of various objects and codes i need my PHYSICAL tool not the catalog one this was a big waste I'm very upset
5,great and simple,this is a book that lays out relationship problems in very simple terms with a simple theory that rings true in each case. it is really true what he's saying!! easy to read. i recommend the book to anyone with family or friends!
3,Good book for the laymen,"It seemed a bit simple. The author took one concept and beat it until a book came out. But good for those that aren't into CBT or therapy and need to learn to shut their mouths. It is an entertaining read, as far as self help books go. I honestly think this book could help certain people, but most would be better served by a meatier book like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Dummies."
4,Great Resource On Hymn Writer Aunt Fanny Crosby,"In the work the author takes the reader through the life of Aunt Fanny. He talks about the Puritan town she grew up in, and her first poem at 8 when she talks about the blessing of being blind. The Author gives great background into the many people that shaped her life, and the lifes that she touched. It is amazing to know that the author found her 204 pen names, and many of her 9,000 hymns. A great work about the Amazing Faith of a Sweet Little Woman. I suggest this as reading for any Christian, Musician, Poet or Teacher."
5,Excellent toy,"My three year old asked for this toy for her birthday because she likes playing with it so much at school. It's amazing. Hours of fun, both building the gears and using the pieces for any number of other games. It's a terrific toy - providing educational entertainment for multiple aged kids and adults. Highly recommended."
4,Christmas present,So I don't really know how it's going to hit the kids. Bought it for brothers: six and almost three.
3,a bit unfair,"This review is a bit unfair, because my child (4) has not played with it much. May be toy overload, and that he was familiar with it, but has barely played with it."
5,Hours of fun,"I gave this to my 3-year old grandson for his birthday. He played with it for over an hour and has since, according to his mom, continued to be fascinated with it. I recommend that future customers read reviews and follow the advice that the Beginner's Set is the best for children under 5 years. My grandson is not yet able to grasp the building capabilities of this toy, but enjoys stacking the gears like Legos, and spinning them by hand on their base. His mom is thrilled that other sets can be bought to add as he grows (I'm already thinking about the spinning monkeys for Christmas!)Super toy! Wish it came with more than one handle to spin the gears."
2,i dont understand where the 3 yr old comes into play?,"I bought this specifically for my home daycare, thinking it would be a big hit with my 4 and 5 yr olds, especially.. but it definetly wasnt,they cannot play with this toy by themselves at all.. which is fine, i will sit and play with them with it, and I do, but at 5, you should be able to play with this, and alot of the pieces you have to shove onto the other gears. i think its definetly for older kids, maybe 6-9?"
4,Gears for years.,"My daughter received this as a gift over two years ago when she was four. She loves it and has played with it at least once a week if not more. She builds many different things with this set, it is easy to change around so she never gets bored with it."
3,"Great for teaching kids mechanics concepts, and unique play","I purchased this for my 4 year old son and he doesn't really like it. He used the attaching pieces to make things like he would with blocks; the gears just lay on the floor. I personally think it is a great toy to teach kids mechanical concepts. I did myself have trouble figuring out how to place attaching pieces in multiple formats, so it is a good idea to guide your child with this toy so that they can see how creative they can get with this. Maybe my son will get into it later, I think it's worth hanging on to."
3,A little boring,"This was a gift for my 4 yr old for Christmas. He has played with it once. If you have a small toddler they would enjoy it, my son was a little too advanced for this."
1,Dangerous!,"I have a 3 1/2 year old son who LOVES to build things. He loves toys that move, and he loves toys that constantly change. When I saw this product, I thought for sure I had a jackpot winner. We had a Groupon, which brought the price down to $5. Had we paid any more than that, we would be a lot more unhappy than we are. $5 is even too much, I think.The cheap plastic green base is REALLY hard to put together. Tonight, my husband was attempting to snap the pieces together, and it sliced his thumb, and sliced another finger bad enough that he was bleeding pretty heavily. The connectors & pillars are also REALLY difficult to use. You have to push them really hard to get them on & then when you try to remove them, it's very difficult. Maybe an older child would be able to, but my toddler can't use this toy by himself.We've had this toy for under a week, and it's held his interest for maybe five minutes of playtime. Will be donating this to the Goodwill."
3,"Great concept, lacking design","These sound like a really great building set with lots of educational potential. Unfortunately, the pieces are not designed very well. Many of the pieces are difficult for little ones to put together, much less to pull back apart. Also, the way the pieces work together is pretty limiting to how you can build and get the gears working together. Various pieces interconnect, but they don't all universally interconnect, and if you connect some with blank spacer connects and others with the gear axle pieces, they come out different heights and the gears don't line up. Ideally a set like this would be designed with universally connecting pieces that would allow for things to easily line up and work together. There's definitely fun to be had with this toy, but it could be much much better had more thought gone into its design."
1,we hated this.,It just wasnt fun. It didnt come with enough pieces for the price they were asking but we tried it anyway...along with magnalinks..Magnalinks won us over in comparioson. I really dont even know what happened to theses gears..they were hard to snapped together my 3 year old and 4 year old and even my 8 year old had no interest in them.If you like this kind of stuff i recommend the magnalinks!
3,there are better toys out there,"If you are interested in manipulatives there are many on the market and this one just doesn't get much milage at our house...conceptually, it is very educational but it really lacks the fun factor after you've played with it a few times....perhaps it is just limiting with a small beginner set, but really , I can't say that I will be investing in new sets just to get my kids interested in the one they already have..."
3,Looked like fun but....,"My 4 year old son is really into building and seeing how things work so I thought this starter set would be a great toy, but it fell a bit short for us. My son found it a bit difficult to secure some of the additional pieces to the gears. Every 2 seconds I'd hear ""mommy I can't do this please help me!"" Perhaps getting a bigger set with more options would've been a better idea."
4,With A Bit of Difficulty,"Just like the other review, its a bit difficult for a 3 yo to put together the green plates without my help and at times even I am having a difficulty putting them and pulling them apart. Also when all the gears are connected, there are times when its hard to crank them up or roll them all together. The plates easily slide too which make turning the gears extra difficult. One tiny hand has to hold a small space in the plates to keep them in place while the other tiny hand attempts to wheel the gears. Would have been more fun if these issues are going to be addressed. But I have high hopes for this toy bec once we get past those issues, its really fun playing with it."
3,"I really wanted to like it, but it it is hard for little kids to put together","This it the type of toy that looks great for 2-4 year olds to work on spatial perception, cause/effect, etc.You can set the gears in several configurations to figure out which parts will move or not. With this specific set you can't build a lot of different contraptions, but you can set gears in different spatial configurations.Conceptually, this seems great for young kids, but something that is somewhat limited for older kids. The pieces are durable and of high quality. The problem is that the pieces fit too tight, so it is really hard (nearly impossible) for little hands to do the assembling and manipulation. If the adult needs to put together the toy, and then help the child move the pieces then, in my opinion, the value of the toy goes away. Now, if they could only modify the pieces slightly so little kids could actually play with them (instead of just looking) this would be a wonderful toy."
4,Creative spin on Black Metal.,"What makes this band somewhat interesting to listen to is the fact that some songs are barely guitar driven yet manage to come off as a perfect mix to the rest of the songs. This band, well one man band, has really managed to catch my interest in the fact that the sound is so diverse. I hear all sorts of different world style musics, but at the same time still get my black metal fix. A bit bland at some points, but don't let that discourage you from buying this album. A lot of songs lyrics are in german, not to say that makes it any less interesting for some it's an added plus. It's a real personal call on this CD my friends have given me mixed reviews, but I for one give it a solid 4 stars."
2,Don't use on dry cough,"I used this because I had laryngitis and thought I might end up with a throat infection or bronchitis. I took it twice - 4 hours apart - like antibiotics. I ended up with the worst dry hacking cough, painful in the chest and back. I can't stop once I start - and it just keeps coming on. Goldenseal is only good to dry a wet cough. Do not use if you do not have a wet cough. And use sparingly!"
1,Not Good,Tried using it to hook up my Motorola web-top application with no success.. I just had to purchase a monitor with HDMI port
3,Doesn't pass HDCP,"Apparently this doesn't handle the HDCP issue when trying to go from Apple TV to and older HDTV using DVI. Some standard resolution gets through, but all HD is blocked."
5,worked great,shipping was slow but product worked great. used for an old sony HD projection. my cable box only had HDMI out so this was perfect.
1,Product Does Note Work,"This seemed like a simple enough purchase, and the low price seemed right. I got what I paid for. I purchased the adapter to output video from my computer to my monitor. The device did not work. Also, one of the screw seemed to be very bent and did not spin freely. Buy an adapter from somewhere else. For the $1.88 that I paid, it isn't even worth the hassle to return it."
1,Did Not Work,"I bought this to hook up a PS3 (with an HDMI cable) to an LG computer monitor. It didn't work--no signal at all. Maybe I received a faulty product. Maybe it just doesn't work with PS3s for some reason. I didn't care enough to troubleshoot with other output signals. In any case, this purchase was a complete waste of money for me. But at least it wasn't very much money..."
5,Comcast,"Just know if you're trying to use this for a Comcast cable box for HDMI you won't be able to get any sound. The video looks fine and I imagine even the sound would be fine if I were using it for anything that could actually play sound, but I am not."
5,What a bargain,"My Sony HDTV is one of the first HDTV's to hit the market, and didn't have an HDMI port, it has a DVI-M port instead. My new Blue-Ray DVD player has a HDMI output, so I searched for an adaptor. Most I found cost anywhere from $30-40, and then I came across this one for $4. It works great, and now I can use my Blue-Ray player with my TV even though my TV doesn't have an HDMI port. I spent a lot of money for my TV when I purchased it a few years ago, and it still works very well. Imagine how crazy it would be to have to buy a new TV just because my older TV didn't have a HDMI port. This adaptor has saved me several hundred dollars, at least for the time being."
2,if it worked the price is great,First one came defective so i decided instead of taking another gamble i would just pay a little bit more and get a name brand one. The price though had it worked was awesome i just didnt have time to waste if i got another defective one. But amazon shipping was great and the item got to me in 3 days which was pretty fast for free shipping it was just unfortunate that the guy didnt work.
1,PIECE OF JUNK!!,works just as advertised except for the bar that moves from left to right across my tv this thing sucks DO NOT BUY THIS!!
2,No go,Didn't work when I tried to connect my HDMI splitter to my DVI monitor.Belkin PureAV AV54007X DVI-D (M) to HDMI (F) Video Adapter worked instead.
5,Works as advertised,"A simple device...works as indicated...great service from vendor ""tianadeals""...great price...very reasonable shiiping charge...quick delivery!"
2,Not so great...,"I will say that I typically do not like buying expensive name brands like Monster when looking for cables. I bought this for the low price and I eagerly hooked it up to my brand new monitor.So far so good as I laughed about how suckers bought the Monster adapter. However, after about a week I noticed that I was getting green and red dots on images.I first believed it was my video card, and then the monitor itself. However, after I replaced the expensive Monster adapter, the problems ceased.Perhaps I had a defective adapter, but that is my experience and I thought I would share it with the potential buyer. Buyer beware."
2,Misleading description,"The description says ""HDMI, the hottest high-definition digital audio/video standard, is compatible with all digital video connection, DVI"" and kind of implies the converter carries audio. It doesn't, and was useless to me. If you need audio, do something else.If all you need video, this is good quality for the price."
4,Great for connecting Laptop to your TV,"I have a Macbook with a mini-dvi outlet. I use a mini-dvi to dvi connector for that and then use this dvi-to-hdmi connector for connecting to my TV (which does not have a dvi input). I have had it for 2 years without any problem.Picture is great and I use a ""Belkin Audio Y Cable Splitter 1-Mini Plug/2-RCA Plugs"" for the audio connection."
1,Best thing about it is the price,"The connector arrived slightly bent, and would not fit on to the DVI port of my computer.After bending it back to shape, the connector failed to send a video signal from my MacBook Pro to my Sony HDTV. The computer recognized that a Sony TV was connected, but no video signal came through. At least it was super cheap so I dont feel so bad."
4,HDMI - DVI,Worked as advertised. Very pleased with purchase. This adapter does not carry audio however the video is fantastic. You can do a work-around on the audio by adding an additional cable (RCA Jack) to carry the audio signal.
