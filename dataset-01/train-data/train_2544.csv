2,disapointment,"I don't enjoy using this pillow. I have a king size bed, which makes the size not a problem for me. But I feel very restrained by the pillow and my arms become numb in the morning when I wake up after using the pillow. It didn't help me to relieve my back pain either."
2,Not very happy,"I wouldn't say I am very happy with this pillow. Maybe that's because I am not used to very thick pillows and it hurt my neck after I tried to sleep on it. Also, it's a little bit short and I cannot place my legs comfortably. The cover is made of polyester and everything sticks on it, and it was very unpleasant in summer - cotton would be much better and healthier. But I sewed cotton covers myself. The only 2 points I am giving to it - it gives great support to my back when I sit - I am experiencing some lower back pains during my pregnancy, and for that purpose it is great. So, I hope I can use it much better when I will be breastfeeding my baby - at least it would not be waste of money then."
1,Terrible!!!,"I bought this pillow early on in my pregnancy thinking it would be a life saver. It wasn't. The pillow comes in a case that is very rough and as far as I know you can't buy an actual pillow case for it (only replacement cases which I assume are also very rough.) I tried making my own by cutting the end off of a regular pillow case but it would never stay in the same spot. This is not a comfortable pillow to lay your head on. The neck support is terrible. In the end I ended up throwing it away. I'm using a ""pregnancy pillow"" now and love it. You get back and belly support without the neck pain."
5,Leachco Back 'N Belly - Contoured Body Pillow - Ivory,Good to have this pillow to have a good & comfortable night sleep during your pregnancy. Initially my wife found the pillow not so great but one day when she slept without this the next day morning she was having body pains and was uncomfortable and then from that day she never sleeps without it.
5,Back 'N Belly,"Hard to say for sure what is really responsible here, but before we purchased this item, my wife had severe pain from lactic acid build-up through the night, during her pregnancy. She was using every pillow in the house on Doctors orders to keep her head and arms elevated with limited success. Upon the first night of using this product, that pain was limited, enough so, that she could sleep through the night. In addition, she is able to sleep in several positions much more comfortably, then she can with out. Finally, this product will help when she is nursing and cuddling the new born."
5,Money well spent,"I am so happy my husband convinced me to just buy a pillow! I cannot believe how much of a difference it makes in my sleep and ability to be comfortable. Plus I love that it can be used for several other things, like nursing, using it to keep your upper body more elevated, etc. All those extras are on the insinde of the package, and its just a matter of changing the position of the pillow. Right now I am loving that I can make it hug my body. I am usually a back sleeper so sleeping on my side is still hard to remember. Great price on amazon too."
4,Great for Pregnant Women,Great pillow. The only thing I don't like is how tight the fabric is at the top where your neck goes. You almost need to cut a slit in it or something.
5,This pillow is saving me,"At first the seam was a bit tight but after about a week of using it I got used to it and the seam loosened up a bit. It's amazing to not have to move your pillows every time you roll over. I've had this since about 6 mos. pregnant and had tried lots of other pillows before that (snoogle, boppy, etc) and this is the WINNER. I could NOT sleep without it! I sleep soundly with the exception of having to get up and go to the bathroom. I crave this pillow now. I had to go away for a few nights and had a sub-standard boppy with me and suffered the whole time! It is a large pillow but I have no issues with someone else in the bed (California King) and sleeping comfortably with it. It's amazing for my back and hips. I highly recommend you try this FIRST because it has all the components of a perfect pregnancy pillow."
3,Not bad... not perfect,"Well I needed a body pillow because my hips have been hurting since early in my pregnancy. After reading reviews I decided upon this one.I like it, but after about a week of use, my neck was killing me. The pillow is so thick it really doesn't work for a head pillow. However, my husband suggested I flip it around (the ""U"" piece at the bottom rather than under my head) and then I can still use it for my hips. That worked out well; I am back to my Tempur Pedic neck pillow which is far more comfortable.It *does* take up a lot of room in the bed though."
4,Better than I expected!,"After reading the previous reviews, I was a bit concerned about the tight stitching some users mentioned, but I have to say that it does not bother me at all! Everything about the pillow is very comfortable, the size, thickness, shape.. only the fabric could be a bit softer, but it doesn't really matters that much to me.The back support could also be a little bit improved, but overall I have to say I was surprised to find this pillow to be so comfortable, and at such a great price.I will definitely use it even after my pregnancy! (I have found my husband sleeping with it a couple times so far)"
2,It's Ok,It is very large and takes up a lot of space in the bed. It is soft and comfortable but it did not help my back pains. I need something firm to support my back at night. I went back to using couch pillows.
5,Too comportable~!!,This pillow is too comfortable so that I can't get out of my bed!!!Addicted to this pillow~!!!Very nice~!!
5,How did I ever sleep without this?,"Wow, this is the most amazing pillow ever! I am 18 weeks and have been using this pillow for the last week and half. I wish I would have discovered it sooner. As an avid stomach sleeper, the transition to side sleeping was miserable before this pillow.While it is large, I much prefer the full U style to the pillows that are only half of this one...this allows you to switch from the left to the right and back without ever having to move the pillow.Originally I thought I would appreciate the support on the front and between my legs, which I do, but the relief that pillow provides for the back is unbelievable. I would 100% recommend this pillow to any pregnant woman seeking a full night's sleep!"
2,Returning It,"I really, really wanted to like this pillow. It's perfect in every way, except for one. Unfortunately, the one flaw is a dealbreaker.The pillow wraps perfectly around your body. You can position it in dozens of ways while sitting or lying down. However, it is not comfortable to sleep on, and sleeping is what I bought it for. The seam running around the interior of the pillow is very tight and stretches away from the padding, biting into your flesh. (If you want more details before you decide whether or not to purchase, Mel's 1 star review is definitely worth a look. I read it before my purchase, but decided the pillow was worth a shot since it had such great reviews on average. I should have listened to her!)"
5,Best flat iron I've used,I've had this flat iron for about 6 months and it works perfectly. Using in conjunction with a shine spray (spray hair then flat iron) makes my hair very sleek and shiny. I've had many ceramic flat irons before and this by far is the best.
5,High Quality,The time it will save you is worth the money. It heats up in literally 1 minute. Other straighteners I have used take about half an hour...
1,Defective Product,"The flat iron that I ordered quit working after 2 weeks of use. I was not satisified with this. The price was good and the shipping was free, but I sent the product back after 2 weeks."
2,Not pleased,I am not very please with this item and was sent ridculous return guidelines from the seller so I am stuck with it.
1,Too Hot to Handle,"I bought this straightener through NoCurls on Amazon. After one use, it fried itself and would not light up at all, even after I switched outlets and tried to reset them. It worked pretty decent the one time I tried it but I went against the advice of my friends who told me they had them too and they only worked one or two times before overheating. My ceramic one from Walmart has been working just fine for over a year now.Oh and I suggest that you DO NOT buy this or anything from NoCurls. They have absolutely terrible customer service. First they wanted to keep 30% of what I paid to restock the defective product. Then they threatened not to refund my money after I had already returned the product because I wrote bad feedback about their customer service. After I removed what I wrote and two months of unreturned emails and waiting for my refund, I finally had to get Amazon to assist me with the refund. Please be aware."
2,Very Disappointment with Product and Amazon,"A friend of mine has this hair iron. When on vacation I used it alot. And fell in love with it. It made my hair so straight and KEPT it straight even through all the humidity. So when i got home i ordered it from Amazon. It worked great for 1 month and then all of a sudden it just stopped working all together. I called Amazon and they said no refunds and to call the manufacture of the iron. I called them and said that the guarantee is not valid if purchased online. There was nothing they could do. I called Amazon back and told them and asked for some help, but they just pretty much told me there was NOTHING they could do. Now i am stuck with this $100 hair iron that is good for nothing. So beware when purchasing this product. If you decide to, I hope you have better luck than I did."
4,HAIR STRAIGHTENER,"HEATS UP QUICKLY, BUT I HAVE ALSO OWNED THE REGULAR CHI. I'M NOT CONVINCED THE TURBO IS ANY BETTER FOR THE PRICE. BUT THE CHI HAIR STRAIGHTENERS ARE THE BEST!!!!!"
1,It Quit Working,I purchased this product back in March of this year and it hasn't even been 4 months and it quit working!!!!
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"I bought this straightener one year ago, I didn't even use it every day, and now it doesn't work at all. It will only get warm now and even after leaving it on for 1 hour I could still touch the ceramic irons. I will never buy a CHI product again."
2,Thanks to Amazon,"This was a Christmas gift that did not work after a few months. My granddaughter liked the flat iron ,but it is too pricey to not last a year. Thanks to Amazon they replaced it so my granddaughter was happy."
5,Terrific Flat Iron,"I previously had the 2"" Farouk model and switched to this one. Just as good and much lighter in weight!"
3,"works good, but dries out hair","I'm not a huge chi fan. I find that the chis work really well, especially when first using them. However, this product really dried out my hair over time, making it brittle. So, it works, but does cause long term damage."
5,"Have been using it for over three years, LOVE IT","I recently bought this product for my mom because she, too, has fallen in love with the magic of the CHI. I have been using this tool for over three years, and it works just as well as it did when I first took it out of the box. It makes my hair so sleek and so glossy, everyone always asks me if I've had it done, even though it was only 45 minutes of my own time (I have thick curly hair). It is worth every penny, and it will become an indispensable part of your hair routine. I do not straighten my hair everyday, but I usually straighten my bangs and I see FAR LESS damage to my hair than my friends who use metal straighteners.I am a proud convert to the cult of CHI, and I can never go back to regular straightening irons. My friends have ceramic ones that work just as well, or better, but my hair stylist used this on me, and I can honestly say that this is my favorite hair straightner.It's worth it! Love this thing!"
5,Excellent,"This flat iron is by far the best I have ever used. I highly recommend it for all types of hair but especially people with short hair, such as myself."
3,CHI Turbo Flat Iron..,"This one does not pull on my hair as much, but it does nto get as hot as the other one. It has a temp gauge and the velvet liner. I would buy the original vs. this one."
5,Awesome...,This product is a salon quality product. It takes my wavy hair and very quickly makes it straight. Hasn't damaged or dried out my hair.
5,Farouk CHI Turbo Regular 1 inch ceramic flat iron,This was a birthday gift for my daughter. She thinks it is the best ever. It came fast and perfect. Thanks!
4,Great Product!,This flat iron is great and I received it in one day after ordering from Amazon. I have used other flat irons and they do not work as well.
3,Great Product!,"Great product! I had the older version & this one seems to work better. I highly recommend the chi, they are sooo worth the money!"
1,broke after one week,"This morning my CHI simply would not turn on, even after pressing the reset button and trying multiple outlets. I'm returning it to amazon and going back to the FHI iron. (I've had a FHI for 2.5 yrs and while it is still working fine, wanted a new one on hand in case it dies one of these days.) I would not recommend the CHI."
5,Ceramic Flat Iron -- Excellent addition to my morning regime,"The Farouk CHI GF 1583 is the perfect counter to combat the Wild Woman from Boreno look. I has tamed thick, coarse, wavy hair into soft workable hair that moves. I love it!"
2,The straightener broke less than 3 months after purchase,"I don't recommend this product because I purchased it in May and it broke in August. I tried to contact Farouk to get a replacement but the warranty is void for straighteners purchased over the internet. However the good news is that Amazon will replace the product.To save yourself the hassle of all of this, I recommend you purchase a straightener from another brand."
3,Works great until it breaks,"The chi is an amazing straightener. I live in humid Florida, and this straightener gets my curly hair pin straight and it stays straight until I wash it. Unfortunatly, my first one just stopped working and farouk refused to take it back because ""Amazon in not an authorized dealer so your warranty is void"". Luckily, Amazon replaced my straighter at no charge and I didn't even have to pay for shipping. This is a great straightener and its worth its weight in gold (when it works), but at $120 dollars you are taking an expensive risk."
2,Problem with shorting out,"I first bought the original CHI iron and it did a great job on my hair and I loved it. However, after about a year, it shorted out and would not heat up. I then bought the CHI Turbo thinking it might have a sturdier power cord. It only lasted 4 months before it too shorted out. I know several others who have had the same problem - this product is too unreliable for the high price and it seems like a problem that the manufacturer could easily correct. I am now purchasing the Sedu - we'll see if it lasts longer."
3,Great at first,"I bought this flat iron after seeing my boss's hair-wow ! I loved it- used it everyday for shiny, smooth hair. After 2 months it died and now I am upset. We will see how hard it is to be repaired and how long it will take. It is going to cost me $15.00 plus shipping to have it repaired- after buying it for a total of $127.98- you would think they would eat the repair costs."
4,"CHI Turbo Regular 1"" Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener","my hairdresser recommended chi flat straightening iron for my curly hair and so far i am very happy about the results since i have a very unruly curly hair this product work wonders for my kind of hair. it is a little bit pricey but, it is worth the money."
2,Don't Bother,"I had the old Chi iron for about 5 years and it was great. When it finally quit on me, I decided to buy this new and improved iron. Boy was I disappointed! It doesn't get hot enough, it's heavy and I really didn't like it at all. Within two weeks I got a new Solia iron and it's wonderful!"
1,No support or warranty from manufacturer,"I thought this was a good quality product, seeing as how it cost so much, but it broke after my daughter used it for a month, after which time it was too late to return. The manufacturer will only repair or replace it if it is sold through a professional salon. So, even though you buy it through Amazon, a respectable place to buy things, you won't get any support for it after 30 days. You won't find this out until you read the pamphlet that comes with the iron."
1,DISAPPOINTING,i bought this item in early april. it's now mid-july and the thing just quit working. i went to turn it on the other day and it wouldn't heat up. so that's a lot of money to spend on something that worked for 3 and half months! the store wouldn't return it either since you can only return things within 30 days! don't waste your money!!
1,Buyer Beware!,"I bought one of these for each of my daughters (two total). My daughters knew these were really expensive flatirons and were very careful to not wind the cord around the unit or kink it in any way. After 6 months one of them seemed to acquire a short in the cord and would only work sporadically. No problem, I thought, it's still under warranty. I called Farouk and they REFUSED to honor the warranty stating that I had bought it online and, therefore, that voided out their warranty! The customer service rep said if I would have read the warranty I would have seen this. I pointed out to her that this would have been impossible since I didn't have the warranty to read until I had already bought the product. Her response was that I could have gone to their website and read the warranty before I bought it! Who does that? So, although the product itself is wonderful when it works, I would caution everyone against doing business with this company."
1,Where's the heat?,"When I received this straightener, I used it one day and it worked great. By the second and third time, it wasn't as hot, even though the setting is at high. It heats up quite a bit significantly less than it did at first.Now I have to send it back.... and do I want to go to all this trouble again with this same product? No, I'll go back to the cheaper straightener that I bought at Target."
1,Beware!,"Careful guys, i bought this straightener and it literally crapped out after five minutes. And for the five minutes that it it did work it burnt my hair. It is all singed and discoloured. So much for grad photos. As you can tell i am angry. BEWARE of this product i do not reccomend it to anyone who values their money!sincerlycat"
1,it was a christmas gift...!!,"I bought this flat iron 2-3 weeks ago...we did use it 3 times and its broked...dosent work!!! and I dont now what to do... do I going to loose my money???? dont have the recipt, no box."
1,Don't buy this!,"I have a Chi Turbo flat iron that I bought full price several years ago. It is perfect in every way. When my daughter left for college I bought another on Amazon. The product that arrived on my doorstep is nothing compared to the real thing. It is a cheap, imitation of the Chi Turbo! It does not heat up as high as my original one and is very tinny and cheap feeling. It is definitely not a real Chi Turbo. I am very disappointed!"
2,red chi,"i got this chi after my pink chi broke after less than a year after it was purchased. i havnt used this chi for a long time, but i dont think its as great as it sounds. it takes a few times to flatten the hair, and it doenst curl that well. it does leave your hair with a smooth and sleak look afterwards. i wouldnt recommend this chi to someone with thick, wavy, or long hair. this iron doesnt style very well, but it makes ur hair very nice and sraight. but i would recomment to try a different chi, as the chi irons are usually very good products."
1,WOW... had i known,"i am finally enlightened! after purchasing 5 various CHI straighten irons (over the past 4 years or so) i have realized... it's NOT JUST ME.every one of these 1 star reviews have been my exact experience. the CHI irons work well for awhile then nothing, in each case i thought it was something i did.thank goodness i didn't waste the time or energy persuing a refund, it seems fruitless and frustrating.well, the time has come and i need another one, i will looking elsewhere. NO MORE CHI for me."
3,worked for 2 1/2 years!,"My daughter loved this Chi. She said it is the only product that has made her hair straight and shinny. It has held up for 2 and a half years. The cord is now giving her problems. If she doesn't ""hold"" it a certain way, it will shut off. I have contacted Chi several times to send it back. The warranty states that when out of warranty, they will repair for $35. However, you must first contact them for an RA#. Well, they never contact you back! That is their scam. Also just an FYI, these are not really warranted as they claim. If they are purchased anywhere other than thru a Salon, if it had broke in the one year period, they would not have repaired it, read your warranty.. it clearly states that. Chi seems to run a scam when it comes to warranty's. Their products are great while working, but they do not stand behind them once they break."
1,mine quit too in less than a year,"My daughter uses almost daily, and the first one lasted a month. Amazon was nice enough to replace it, but now that one has died 8 months later. I realize they don't last forever, but for that kind of money, I expect several years of use, and according to reviews, this appears to be a common problem."
3,Not worth the price,"I bought this for my teen daughter because I have heard and read so many rave reviews about it. While it works well enough, I don't think it works that much better than the $25.00 ones we already owned. It heats up quickly and does straighten hair, but again, I and my daughter did not find that it straightened hair better and did not find it worth the extra expense."
5,Excellent,"This is the best straightener I've ever used. My hair is thick, wavy and long and within about 10 minutes it makes my hair smooth, bone straight, shiny and silky. I have owned the exact same model for use in the UK for 2 years and it's been brilliant, and I recently bought this US one to use while I'm visiting my family in the States. That's how highly I rate it... I just can't go a couple of weeks without it."
4,Works Well,"This is a good product.I had a cheaper flat iron from another brand and it worked just as well, but my hair smelled like it was burning even though that too was a ceramic flat iron. The other flat iron also pulled out pieces of my hair.This product leaves your hair shiny, smooth and smelling like your conditioner rather than flat iron like burnt hair. I recommend this one."
1,VERY BAD FOR YOUR HAIR,"I've been straightening my hair for 10 years now. I understand the damages straightening can do, however I did not actually see the effects until I purchased this particular straight iron. After a couple months of use, my hair started frilling and falling out. It gets your hair pin straight, sure, but not without the cost of severe unsightly damage. I've discontinued straightening alltogether to grow parts of my hair out, and will then never purchase another CHI hair straightener again."
2,Too much.,"Although the Chi is supposed to be the best in hair straighteners, I have had difficulty using it and am returning to my old flat iron. The Chi straightened my hair so much that it would just stick straight out and I could not control it to get the look I wanted. I am NOT saying that its quality is bad, or that it is a bad product; I am simply saying that I had difficulty using it successfully and have decided it's not for me."
2,Farouk Chi hair straightener is really not worth it,"I used to have a basic CHI and it worked pretty well so I ordered this one thinking it would be better because it has temperature controls. Unfortunately, it only goes to 350degrees and apparently that is not hot enough. It doesn't keep the frizz away and it doesn't make my hair stick straight--only ""not frizzy"". I'm bummed I spent so much on this one and it doesn't do what I want."
3,stick to the original,purchased this ceramic flat iron because it advertised it could also curl by wrapping your hair around the outside along the red flet material. Curls turn out funny. Id stick to the original chi for flattening hair.
5,Chi Turbo GF1538 works great!,Bought this product for my daughter. Tried other brands but this one seems to work the best. At a retail store it cost about $30 more. I would not hesitate to buy this product again!
2,CHI TURBO 2'',"this item is grossly overrated! i bought this item to replace my old flat iron because it was falling apart from everyday use for years. what a poor replacement, def NOT worth the money, i wouldnt take this iron if someone gave it to me for FREE. very little heat, my Gold N Hot is wayyyyyyy hotter than this. save your money, do NOT buy this, btw i have thick wavy/ curly hair and i have used many irons before to straighten my hair, this does not do the trick. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
5,Worth the money,"This is my second CHI flat iron. The first one I purchased from a salon probably 10 years ago & actually gave it to my niece who is still using it. This one is a bit hotter, the contoured handle makes it easier to maneuver & the swivel cord is great. I have thick, coarse long hair which MUST be flat ironed. Fortunately I can get away with washing it two - three times a week otherwise I think I would have to cut it off. If you've tried other flat irons in the past & have been discouraged I would certainly recommend this one."
2,"For it's short life, it was great","I purchased this August 13th and got it a week later and it worked great until this morning, 12/26/08. It will not heat up now and I did not even use this daily! For the $100 it is not worth purchasing for only 4 months usage...my advise find something of better value. I will not be purchasing a CHI again. I called Amazon's customer service and they will only take care of this matter in the first 30 days, so I'm not impressed with Amazon's customer service...and I think I was speaking to someone in India. I could not understand him and it seemed he was calling from far away."
1,Chi Straightener- service bad,They took my $20 for expedited shipping and sent it ground. It took 2 weeks to arrived. I told them I wanted a refund for my shipping expense and they did not respond to my conplaint.I rate customer service as bad although the product was exactly what i wanted.
1,Cancelled Order,"Ordered as a gift for my daughter for Christmas--received an email on December 17th, telling me that the item was out of stock and it could be February before I was to receive said item. So, I cancelled"
1,bummer...,"I got this for my daughter as a late Christmas gift. Requested for a gift message which DID NOT happen--bummer #1. It arrived, and to our disappointment, the thing just didn't get hot enough to properly work. Her hair is fine & has a slight natural wave with a tendency to get frizzy without tools or product to help, and any straightener she has used in the past has been able to get her hair nice & straight fairly easily, until now--bummer #2. The packaging itself was horrible--the boxed iron had no support in the Amazon shipping box; it had plenty of room to be banged around during the shipping process (perhaps contributing to the cause of it not being able to get hot?)--bummer #3. So, this has been returned to Amazon for a refund--hopefully there will be no issues with that."
2,Defective,"The Turbi Chi arrived in the expected time, but when I gave it as a Christmas gift we immediately noticed that the light was not in the correct position then when it was plugged in it did not work properly. We were able to return the Chi and did receive a refund within a few weeks. The main reason I have given a low rating is because I paid for shipping both ways which should have been reimbursed as well since the product never worked."
1,Worst impossible,"Asked a model and received a different and more expensive and doesn't work now, and charge in my credit card more than I authorize"
5,Super Reliable,Have had this straightening iron for 5 years and is still the best product I've had. Well worth the money.
3,Chi Flat Iron,"This is a nice product, but I am not sure that it is all that it is cracked up to be and for the price, some of the cheaper ones work just as well."
2,Sophisticated Tin Can,"Remember when you were a kid and you tried tying two tin cans together with string to make a ""telephone"" system? Well, Samsung has faithfully recreated that tin-can sound with this phone. It looks and feels slick and smooth, but hey, doesnt a cell phone first and foremost need to be used to converse?! A real disappointment!"
1,"If I could give this 0 stars, I would","This phone is absolutely terrible. Sure, it looks pretty and has cool features, but the one feature it is missing is a little thing called being a good phone. I have been through 5 of these phones already, and every one has a terrible echo. T-mobile has been terrible in that they have not let me get a different model phone without paying for it. So basically, coming from someone who has gone through a good percentage of T-Mobile's stock of 3-E315 phones, stay away."
2,Very poor signal,"Had this phone for 2 months now, since my E715 crashed. The signal reception is poor and spotty when compared to my E715 or the V300. Also, is too easy to turn on the camera accidentally by touching the side switch. All other features are nice though. Would not get this phone again."
3,Good Looking but not enough reception,I liked this phone's appearance verymuch as it is so sleek and beautiful but it had very bad reception power.I have Nokia 6610 and I recently bought this Samsung E315. I used to feel Nokia 6610 had very poor reception of T Mobile (in my home) but this new E315 has worser than Nokia 6610.My recommendation : If you have a strong T Mobile signal in your area - It is the best phone to buy (ofcourse it does not have blue tooth & speaker phone).International (esp. INDIA) : For those people who wants to use it in INDIA - you can go for this phone as it runs on 900 MHz (which matches with AIRTEL / BSNL / IDEA ...). HUTCH can not be used as they run 1800 MHz.Also please check GSMWORLD.com for different International GSM carrier frequencies and compare them with the phone that you want to buy.
2,Great phone but...,"This phone has given me nothing but problems. I'm in a great T-mobile service area, but it has disconnected over half of my calls. It's very sleek and stylish and the camera feature works great, but the dropped calls are unbearable. I'm sending it back for another model. I recommend you not buy this phone."
5,Great phone!!!,"Mine has great reception. I suspect the poor connection problems others have reported have more to do with with cell tower availability than with the phone.I use the camera daily during my property evaluations and thus end up with a pretty high volume of photos. I avoided the T-Mobile picture messaging charges by connecting the phone directly to my computer with a data cable I won on Ebay for only $0.98 plus shipping. Here's the Ebay listing:FOR Samsung E315 E316 E317 D415 x427 Data Cable+CD+MoreI then downloaded a free e315 data handling program from the Samsung web site. The program is:Samsung PC Studio II PIMS & File ManagerI connect the cable to my USB port, fire up the program and download the photos into my computer.By the way, Samsung sells the cable and software as a kit but they charge $80."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PHONE,"I bought this phone about a month ago. I have had Samsung phones in the past and loved them. I upgraded to this phone because of the camera. The camera works great. Unfortunately, I miss several calls and get the messages days later. The phone either does not ring, or I can't call out. Once I finally make a call, the signal is lost and the call is dropped. I called T-MOBILE and they sent me a new phone, that one didn't work either. I sent it back to T-MOBILE and they sent me a third phone. That phone beeps constantly for hours at a time. It's enough to drive you crazy. T-MOBILE will only replace this crummy phone with the same exact phone. This phone is not worth the frustration. Don't buy it and don't use T-MOBILE!! Samsung only sends out refurbished phones...no matter what. T-MOBILE does not back there merchandise, they blame the problems on the manufacturer. Try cingular...or Sprint....BUT NOT T-MOBILE or SAMSUNG!!!...EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING!!"
2,Bug in the Samsung e315 phone,"The speaker in the handset sounds distorted, just enough to be annoying. But the bigger problem, is that there is a software bug in the current version of the e315 phone which I'm sure will be fixed in a later version. You cannot ""add entry"" when trying to store additional phone numbers under a phone book entry name. For example, if you have entered a home number for ""david"" and later scroll to ""david"" wishing to add another entry for his cell, it will not associate the cell number with his name, showing both a home and cell number for ""david"". There is a longer painstaking way to do it. But the bottom line is that the ""add entry"" does not work the way the book or the menu indicates it will. Samsung technical support agreed that it doesn't work and their response to me was ""too bad for you"". I'm sure they will fix this in a later version regardless of their attitude about it to the customer today."
1,good phone but always drop calls,"This phone really gave me good time that I like it very much, however, it often drops calls without any reason. Tmobile offered me another two new phones twice, but it still have this problem. I think, either the phone is not good or Tmobile offers very poor service."
1,Samsung phones break after 2 years - cheap phones,"I have purchased two Samsung phones in the past 5 years, and have had to replace each one after two years. The last Samsung phone I purchased, the Model SPH-N400, only two years ago in July, the flip on one arm broken off/separated from the hinge. WHen I called the warranty department about this issue, I was told that I would be responsible for getting this fixed, and it would cost be about $100+ dollars to fix the phone. What a joke when the value of the phone I bought 2 years ago was $134.99. I will never buy a Samsung phone again, and I recommend that no one elase does either."
4,QUESTION QUESTION,"Does anyone know if there is a way to change the T-Mobile text that appears on the internal screen? Want to edit it, but can't seem to find a place within the phone to do soThanksOther than this the phone seems to work farely well and looks decent"
1,Flimsy import from south korea,"This South Korean phone has very poor reception on the T-Mobile GSM network and is very flimsy. The battery door is not latched properly and can come off easily. The screen is smallish and dim, and the keypad feels just cheap and insecure and unresponsive. User interface is confusing, and the ring tones are too soft (even at the highest volume) for most situations. The built-in camera is capable of VGA resolution but has very poor image quality, worse than the competition. The silver styling is classic but not a stand-out.For T-Mobile, consider the cheaper and much better Motorola V300."
2,Battery life needs a lot of improvement,"This phone itself is fine, but the battery life is extremely short. I am not for sure but seems like its battery is one of those which need to be completely drained before recharging. Otherwise it develops memory and then slowly its life becomes very less.Camera is not very useful because of resolution. But otherwise the phone looks sleek.Depending upon coverage there may be delays in how fast you can make phone calls. Coverage in my area is not very good. So often this phone loses service and I have to wait for a minute or two to be able to make phone calls. This is not a completely this phone's fault though.When the phone loses connection, it goes into an automatic network search mode. It displays Searching for a long time. Even after connection, my phone takes about a minute to load the phone book.The display is not readable in bright sunlight. I think that is the problem with most of the color display phones."
2,Fairly OK phone - Didnt like it too much,"I took this phone after having my Nokia for a year and a half. My friends always seemed to be telling me about how bad T-Mobile service is - but I never seemed to be having problems with it at all when I had my Nokia.But soon I realized it, the service is decent - but the phone was awesome. This phone comparatively not good at all. I get so many call drops and never seem to get decent service. Features are good and the phone looks sleek - but I guess its not providing me the service that I need most - to place crystal clear calls w/o any drops."
2,definetly wouldnt reccomend,"its a cute phone, has good features but..IT SUCKSi am in a t-mobile area and i never have service. i drop calls all the time and can lose service for up to 10 minutes. my sister had the free little blue samsung and it always had service.. i bought this for 100 and it never does! unless youre ready for dropped calls, i wouldnt reccomend it."
1,Crappy phone,"I got this phone, and after taking a video it would not shut down. It broke because I took a video. This phone is not a very good phone at all and I would not reccomend it at all."
1,Samsung let us all down again,"I've had this phone for 9 months and here's what I think about it:Pros: compact...and that's about itCons: poor sound quality,poor reception,it shows 6 bars but when you open it to make a call it magically drops to one bar or none at all.Adress book is so complicated that after inputing close to 100 numbers in I still find it hard to use!Software on this phone is horrible considering any featureNo bluetoothOverall...crappy phone!"
1,"Cute Phone, Horrible Reception","I've had this phone for nearly a year now. At first I was very excited because this was my frist flip phone. My previous Samsung phone had excellent reception, so I figured this would be the same. It's cute, small, and has many nice features on it. Then I began noticing how many calls it was dropping and the horrible reception. I have 2 friends with the same phone and all have the same issue.Yesterday I was talking with one of my friends who has the same phone, and within a 10 minute conversation the call was dropped 4 times! After dealing with this phone for so long, I am fed up. I just got my tax return and I'm going to get a new one today!"
3,Eh.,So-so phone. I had to replace it twice. Friends complained of a static-y connection when I used it.
4,very good basic phone,"this phone is a very good basic phone. it has many qualities that set it apart, including the LED service light on the outside that blinks when service is available and blinks at a faster pace when you have a new voicemail or text message. i really like that feature because it enables me to know if i have any messages or missed calls waiting without even opening my phone. the signal with this phone isnt all that great. the camera quality is nice and basic but nothing that will blow you away. it has good video capabilities but they are very choppy. the customization is cool and the keypad is very easy to use. my only other complaint is that it lacks a password protection feature for text messages. overall, its a decent phone."
5,I brought the Samsung e315 after a Motorola V300 ...,"I had a motorola v300 while I still miss that phone I happen to like the e315. I brought this phone about 4 months ago and I am still liking it. Although I see that they are giving it away - that was not the case for me :( Anyway, let me first say that this phone takes VERY good pictures, just like a digital camera would. You can also take pictures of yourself but closing down the flip and pressing the camera button. I LOVED that. You have caller ID pictures that are displayed externally when somone calls if you choose to do so. You can also record like 10-15 second video clips. I also like that feature. I don't get any dropped calls, and I get pretty good reception.The cons to this phone. You cannot individually assign ringtones - I just found this out today. I didn't like the ringtones that came with the phone and I WISH that this phone was a speakerphone. Other than that I like my phone and don't see myself getting a new one anytime soon!"
3,My phone review,Pros:1.Good reception ( unlike sony ericcson T610).2.Ultra light weight ( unlike some motos).3.Decent battery life(but not like some motos).4.Vivid screen display.5.Lots of internal memory.6.Loud ringer.7.Attractive graphics in the main lcd display.8.Photo caller I.D9.Different caller groups and associated ring tones.Cons:1.No speaker phone and Bluetooth.2.No voice dialing.3.Software bug in the phone book entry editing.4.Horrible buit-in ring tones ( u should download good tones to hear something pleasant).5.Picture from camera appears to be a long shot alhtough it's taken as a close-up using the screen/view finder.6.Phone switches off itself sometimes without any low-battery warning/display( when there is atleast 1 bar in the charge indicator).6.The center button in the menu navigation is somewhat larger than the up/down/left/right keys.
5,Works great as a phone.,"Pros:-Phone is small (virtually smaller than any other phone on the market)- sound quality is amazing, no static at all.- price+contract. it should be -100$ after mail in rebates, which is excellent. It implies you virtually have 2.5 month free.- I do not like all the bells and whistles, but phone camera is great and easy to use.- I HAVE NEVER HEARD THIS PHONE TO BE DISFUNCTIONAL (it is the main reason I have bought it). Check other phones and you will see complaints about phones.Cons:- no regular phone rings. (I really miss my old cell phone ringing tones. New phones are packed with funky ringtones, but it is a problem of every modern phone."
5,Best Skin Care On Earth,I have used this product since 1970. Bought it because it looked lighter than baby oil. Indeed it was. The rest is history and nothing but love. I buy 4 or 5 of the 32 oz bottles a year because all my girlfriends expect it for Christmas. I keep two for myself. People ask what I have on my skin to make it look so healthy. I was in heaven when I could buy the double pack 32 oz bottle for $19.99 at Costco. Those were the good ole days. I always order before the holidays because the price tends to creep up during the season. This really is the best skin care on earth. I use it after every shower from head to toe. I have a special no spill travel bottle just for my oil. I don't leave home without it.
5,neutrogena body oil,I have used this items for a very long time and i love it use it in my hair and on my body this item works greati am in my 50s. Its not to oily its a great item to use i love the way it makes my body feel.
3,Switched product.,"I ordered the original scented body oil and received the sesame formula. I was really disappointed. But now that I have used the oil, I like it too."
4,Moist,"This body oil I use after shower with neutrogena body shower, feeling moist not oily, light for my skin. Does not clog my skin"
5,"Have used this for over 30 years, and nothing compares to it. It also makes my cologne scent deeper, and longer lasting.","It is not staining also, which means it doesn't mess up your great outfits! It's light, and also comes in a fragrance free variety. The light sesame smell is not obnoxious or heavy at all."
3,Smashed,"Box the product was in was crushed (not shipping box), but product was in tact. Since it was a gift it was a little disappointing."
5,Love this stuff!,I have been using the body oil for years now and it is a wonderful product. It's now greasy or heavy on my skin. I tend to have very dry skin and this seals in the moisture and makes my skin glow. Great product.
1,DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is a waste of money and time. It took me less than a day to finish this game, on the hardest setting. This game is straight shooting game, and dumb flashback to vietnam then back....DON'T WASTE MONEY & TIME ON THIS STUPID GAME."
2,GOD BLESS AMERICA,"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, DIDNT KNOW IT WAS ONLY A SINGLE, ADVERTISED IN A MISLEADING WAY"
4,They dynamic duo strikes again,"You had me at ""Click Clack Moo"" and my son still breaks down into hysterical gut busting laughter every single time he reads ""Giggle Giggle Quack"".Imagine my surprise when I hear my husband laughing hysterically while reading my son a story. I said what is going on and he says ""It Duck!"" He could not even hold it together to give me the gist of the story. It was entertaining and educational (sneaking in a little social studies).Thank you for creating a wonderful family experience. Also now, my son wants to run for president so he can get out of chores.But we have to save that five star for Giggle Giggle Quack."
3,Duck For President,"This is a fun and enjoyable children's book. The book's humor makes it interesting and funny. Duck for President can teach about how fun the electoral process can be.It is an educational storybook for kids. It includes duck campaigning, winning over voters, and being elected. The book is silly because it is so unreal. A duck on a farm becomes the president of the United States of America. Duck for President teaches you to never give up and to follow your dreams. Duck made a good campaign, studied his opponent, and came away with the win.This is a fun and enjoyable book that teaches you a lot about the electoral process. It is very silly and teaches you a lesson about how to follow your dreams. It will be a quick read that could give you some laughs."
5,WHAT A CLEVER IDEA ... SO TIMELY!,"This book is a wonderful spoof on the electoral process. It's very clever and the illustrations are wonderful.If I were a cow (there are some who may say I am), I would definitely strike for electric blankets before I gave them any more milk ... or voted for a president who wouldn't promise me at least that much.This author is very talented ... as is the illustrator. Duck already has my vote!ONLY IN AMERICA!"
5,from publisher:,"Our fellow Americans,It is our pleasure, our honor, our duty as citizens to present to you Duck for president in 2008. Here is a duck who began in a humble pond, who worked his way up to farmer, to governor, and now perhaps the highest office in the land.Some say if he walks like a duck and talks like a duck, he is a duck.We say if he walks like a duck and talks like a duck, he will be the next president of the United States of America.Thank you for your vote."
3,What does not kill me makes me duck,"Battle not with ducks, lest ye also become a duck;And when you gaze into the duck, the duck gazes into you."
3,A Good Book but..,"I love Cronin's other books. This one is definitely for older kids (age 7 plus) and while it is a good intro to the electoral process there are things in here that scream ""Bush stole the election!"" if you ask me. I just don't want that whole drama in my children's books. I am keeping it though because it is a good book to begin explaining our system and one that can be referred back to as the child explores the study of politics later."
4,He's Baaaaaaack!,"Ok - I love Duck. His manipulations, his pencil - I love it all. This book has our favorite quacker reaching new heights. While I would give the first two books in this series 5 stars, Pres gets 4 simply because the prose seemed to be lacking something. Click, Clack, Moo and Giggle, Giggle, Quack flow better when read."
1,Very Disappointed,"It is too repetitive, and my son was soon bored with it. Miss Cronin's books have gotten progressively less entertaining and more gimmicky since Click Clack Moo. The pictures are still the best part of this series. This is the last book I'll buy from her."
3,not all it's quacked up to be,I kept hearing great things about this book. I was told it went into great detail about the political process. I found the book to be highly repetitive. he wants to run for office On the next page is the election. He loses. Then there is a cow who sits on two ballots. He wins. He finds that being in that office is hard work. Runs for another office. Same scenario. Buy Kapow instead.
1,Funny? Delightful? How about depressing and disheartening?,"America has a broken electoral system, a polarized electorate, and a dysfunctional Congress, yet somehow this book is amusing?The book could be construed as funny if we ignore the fact that we have a representative form of government. When we remind ourselves that we're a self-governing society, we are reminded that what we now call Duck is what we used to think of as a citizen in public service.In a representative democracy we are all Ducks. And while it may not be fair to judge a light-hearted children's book on the basis of underlying sociopolitical assumptions, it's our responsibility as citizens to accept that we are ultimately responsible for the what's wrong in government, not just teach our children to blame it on Duck. We have met the Duck, and it is us."
3,I love this book- but...,"I love Doreen Cronin's work, and this book is no exception- I absolutely loved Duck for President, as did my parents, and my little sister (who is in high school). Cronin's humor is quirky and fun, and her books are always as enjoyable for adults to read as for children.The reason that I didn't give the book more stars is this: My 6 year old niece, who loved Click, Clack, Moo and Diary of a Worm was somewhat less than enthusiastic about Duck for President. I don't think she quite got the humor of it. I still think it's a great book... But- for the age group that it's aimed at, it's a little off the mark."
5,"Running a Farm Is Very Hard Work, But Duck Did It!","Duck for President is a very good book. It should have won the Caldecott though. It definitely deserves the 5 stars I gave it. Duck for President is a book about a very hard working duck that wants to make his farm a better place. He runs against the leader of the farm, the ever famous Farmer Brown. This book is a very well written book while also being a very funny and well drawn picture book. Duck wants to help his farm and you can help him by reading this book. -Haley"
5,Adults will love reading this to the little ones!,"Cronin books always tickle my funnybone, so it's fun to read them to the little kids, especially since we will read them 1000 times over the next few years!"
5,The Key in the Satin Pocket: An Exciting Book!,"In The Key in the Satin Pocket, Nancy buys a blue satin jacket at a vintage clothing shop. When she models it for Hannah and her father, she discovers a brass key sewn up in a pocket. Further investigating reveals that the key opens a safe-deposit box - and someone wants to steal the contents! Nancy finds the rightful heir to the box, and solves yet anothe case."
1,"karate breaking ....No, just deformed Hands my friend","Pass this video bye. Very little to learn, unless deformed hands are what you are looking for. First 20 minutes are video takes from Mr. Reeves ESPN World breaking Demo. After the 3 or so different ESPN and parking lot video clips are viewed. Sensei Reeves then goes on to show how to punch the makiwara. With little to no hip motion used to punch the makiwara, Sensei Reeves goes on to show (little to no hip motion) basic self-defense application.With 20 years of karate experience (JKA/Shotokan) I saw very little in this video that I could recommend, TO ANYONE!FYI to George Alexander: When you go to an interview. You need a suit. Not some ugly button down summer flower shirt."
3,Only moderately groovy,"This is the third-and, I fear, the weakest-of the Groovies' three Sire albums. If SHAKE SOME ACTION is an ""A"" (and it is), and NOW! a ""B+,"" JUMPIN' is a ""B-.""Yeah, the Byrds covers (""It Won't Be Wrong,"" ""5D,"" ""Ladyfriend"") are pretty cool, and ""Down Down Down,"" ""Yes I Am,"" and the title track are strong originals. But the Dylan and Zevon covers are, let's face it, kinda wack, and the rest is filler. Groovies freaks will have to have this, of course, but this ain't the place to discover a Groovies kinda love."
5,A beautiful album - very uplifting,"I want to tell you how much I enjoyed Singer-Sower. Last year, I got The Roar of Love because I read the Chronicles of Narnia. It hooked me and shortly thereafter, I bought Singer Sower. The Lord really spoke to me through it. The words to Ocean Liner really lifted my spirit. There was something in every song that helped me. Even my sister liked it, which is a miracle because she is very picky about music groups. Very much worth the money."
3,Good Christian Music,"I ordered this CD to replace a very old cassette tape. I've been enjoying The 2nd Chapter of Acts since ""contemporary Christian music"" popped into the scene in the 70's. While this is not one of my favorite albums, it's nice to listen to one of the classic Christian rock bands."
2,tomjordan,"Should have stayed on the harley, not my kind of thought patterns connected to sailing stories, brash descriptions, had I not been to several of his locations I would have had a tough time visualizing to any degree of accuracy his surroudings. It seem the author is more inclined to get drunk and get layed than anything else with the execption of his obsession with his own size and the fact he is covered with tatoo's. I was able to stick it out and complete the book hoping it would get better but not unlike his generator, it never got better........I give it two stars, one for his will to go, and the other for having to much to say about so little."
5,Excellent product!,"I've been using this product for years, and had been unable to find it at my local stores. I was thrilled to have found it on Amazon! It's perfect for sink and countertop cleanup jobs."
5,Excellent!,"I enjoyed this book immensely. I really felt the characters' pain and confusion, and I could imagine the setting--Alaska and the saloon--so clearly. I liked that a real-life character (Soapy Smith) was part of the plot, as well. Hoping to see more from this author."
1,Typical ...,"Nothing Ms. Berlin says in her introduction allows us to escape the fact that Ada Bacot, while pretending to assert her independence and find her self-esteem, simply came to the front and did what Dorothea Dix feared women nurses would do ... find another husband. How pathetic."
3,Nice but I wonder how easy it would be to teach to children,"The cover is enticing and the pictures inside are very appealing. The instructions are clear and concise but I get the strong impression that to achieve this level of detail you need quite a bit of experience at it and an older, or more patient child to do this with. If you have a fair amount of experience handling wool and fibres this may not be such an issue as you can probably work quickly and not need to remove or rework you pieces which always frustrates children so. There is also a lot of ironing and some fine stitching in this method which means a lot of adult input in my house.That said, my six and half year old really wants to make the Cinderella picture!"
5,Shepherd of the Wolves,Great read. This is the first of the novels written my William Slusher that will be re-released under a new publisher. Can't wait to read the new and revised version of Shepherd of the Wolves and get reacquainted with Sheriff Lewis Cody.
5,One book that tells it like it is.,"Slusher is fabulous! He doesn't pull any punches with his writing style. His read is witty, sexy, full of suspense and down to earth. I read about 4 to 6 novels a month and this book was one of the best I have read. Very entertaining!!!"
4,Reframing a volatile issue,"Racism has been an impediment in living up to our ideals as a democracy. It will continue to be a sensitive and volatile issue here in America unless we make an effort to eliminate it. The authors have done a formidable job in reframing the problem in a way to help us trancend it, come together and work toward a solution to what W.E.B. DuBois called the problem of the 20th century. It's a difficult book but well worth the effort!"
1,Why this book fails,"Guiner and Torres write pedantically with little organization or cohesion. Although the anecdotes were interesting, the authors' arguments reek of indolent emotionalism rather than theory and sound policy.I realize this is a critical review. I try to be fair to all viewpoints, but this vacuous work warrants these harsh words. Gerald Torres was a visiting professor at Harvard, where his indifferent attitude to his own class and examination live on in infamy. He is not proficient at conveying information.In short, while Torres and Guiner intended to write a mentally stimulating book, this work is instead mind numbing. Spend your money on another book. For alternate reading on race theory, try ""Unequal Treatment: A Study in the Neoclassical Theory of Discrimination"" by Lundahl and Wadensjo."
4,Wolf's Rain Manga is great,"I read this book and pretty much really enjoyed it. Though i've only seen one episode of the anime, i know the story and the manga has pretty much the same things in it. Though the differences are just some of the scenes and some minor characters. What i liked most about this was that they showed where each character gets his personality from and tell something on their background. In the back,they have a section that the authors wrote to tell you about the differences and how the characters were created to suit the manga. If you buy from an actual Waldenbooks or Borders store (for $14.99), you get a box set that comes with Vol.1, and a slot for Vol.2 which comes out in Feb.2005. I hope this review was helpful to you."
4,really cool!,"ive only read the first book, but a wolf that can disguise itself as a human! thats wild! anyone who likes wolves should give this manga a try. but i havent seen the anime tough either so im not a devoted fan."
5,One of the BEST shows on TV --- ever...!!!,"My husband and I could hardly wait each week to see this show. We totally believe it is one of the BEST shows ever. Geena Davis does an AMAZING job acting out her role and character. What class.I agree, some of the problems and their conclusions may not have been exactly realistic, but hey, who wants total realism?? Take a look around gang... check it out. Our ""real"" government has so many crooks running things, it is just refreshing seeing how it SHOULD be done. I would NOT have watched this show if it had been written and portrayed as things are now in the political world.Let me also say that I am proud and thankful to be an American. A citizen. I am thankful for the freedoms we enjoy in this country. Seeing this show makes me want to protect it even more.I agree, the cover art sucks. It looks cheap and B-rated. This show was a class act, and I too, hope that someday it will be picked up by some cable channel and continued. Can we vote on that?"
4,"""Women's Answer to West Wing""","""When we heard there was going to be a series on a woman US president we watched it. When getting DVDs of West Wing we saw we could get DVDs of Commander in Chief.We thought Geena Davis was excellent as the president and Donald Sutherland was at his smarmiest...maybe just a little too much. The kids weren't very believable to me. They were a little to risque for high school students in my opinion. I like to think they would have higher morals."
3,Unhappy that the series ended...,"I loved this series (not as much as the west wing), but was extremely unhappy that they split the first season into two parts (forcing two purchases). I was also unhappy with the season ending.Overall, Geena Davis was great. The plots were great. The funny aspect needs work, and the other characters could have been much better.If you are a politics fan, you will enjoy it. If you are looking for a good drama, there are better ones out there."
4,more of this series?,"I was watching this series here in Australia on weekly showing-a few years ago- then just before the last few episode's were to show the channel removed it -I ranf TV staation asked ""why"" as it was top series in america? I loved the show & thought Gena Davis wonderful part- so was delighted to get the DVD"
2,Beware my copy is dvd-r,"The workout itself is very good. However mine is a dvd-r and has started skipping around. I was only able to do the upper body cardio, the upper body with weights and the floorwook. That clocked in to be around 30 min. Also if you try to watch this dvd before actually doing the workout, you can get motion sickness. I don't know what the cameraman was thinking with the weird angles but that also takes away from the workout."
4,"Great workout, but poor production quality","Wow. I just finished working out to this DVD, and I am really glad I bought it. My entire body feels good and worked hard.I am so sorry the quality of the DVD is as poor as it is. They had to send me a second DVD, because the first one I ordered stopped midway and just wouldn't continue no matter what DVD player I used. The second one has serious sync problems with sound, and the digital images stop and start abruptly throughout. If I didn't feel so great from this intense yet safe workout, I think I'd have to shelve or return it. Sue should redo this one. It is truly one of the best overall workouts for both strength and flexibility I have used. I have back problems, but this workout is fine even for my tricky back. I really do feel like I worked every muscle!"
1,Great Kicking Distracted by Bad Production,"This DVD could of been better served if the production crew spent just a few more dollars in making it right. The drills and content is fine, thus getting one star. However, you get a headache and distracted by the weird angles of the show. It really looks like the camera-person is kneeling on the floor and shooting upward. This gives an odd perspective to seeing how the drills are to be done. It is also quite silly that you can see the camera person walking around the lead lady because of the floor-to-ceiling mirrors at the front of the room. Do not purchase this DVD and waste your money."
4,Excellent book for every musician,"This book explain the theory behind many aspects of music ,focusing on the perceptual ,""sound"" aspect, rather than presetning theory in a completely abstract way. It lacks only deeper explanations and references when it presents harmony and it's relation to frequencies.A little more mathematical treatment or just some references to those interested in going deeper in the subject would be good,even thoguh it's not the main goal of the book. The best part is that the ""sound"" section of the book wich is just marvellous, inciting insights in the very essence of music.The tritone subject had excellent coverag,and provided me a needed knowledge. It helped me a lot in understanding music and widening my perception. Almost every musician can make a good deed to himself reading this book."
1,Better than a sleeping pill,"I can't imagine anyone trying to learn music from this weighty tome. I was ready to open a vein slogging through the confusion. One gets the sense that the author is trying very hard to show just how gol dang smart he is, and I suspect the glowing reviews are from his friends. This book is anything but reader friendly. Fine books on learning music abound-- sadly this isn't one of them."
5,On Target,The product provided for me or any student all the information needed to successfully take both these test. Excellent!
1,Doesn't prepare you for current Service Packs/ Windows settings,"I just finished my 2nd try on the MCDST 70-271 exam and got the same score as my first exam. This book has loads of information, but none of it is geared towards today's mcdst questions. Your better off finding a book or webservice that has questions more related to the test. The questions in this book are very tricky and very detailed. The questions on both exams I've had, are much more vague and harder to answer. I'm throwing these books away and looking for something that works.."
1,"Amazon nimnews don't understand the meaning of ""bundle""!","I have ordered this item twice and each time the jerkwads who work for Amazon would break the set and only send half of it, just the study guide for the 70-270 exam leaving off the guide for 70-271. It may be a good product but I've learned to only buy books that come in singles from Amazon."
1,****ALERT****,"What is up with THIS??? I mistakenly bought this thinking it was a new Gravediggaz album. I put the CD on and it sounded oddly familiar - That's Frukwan all right but it's the Frukwan solo album that came out last year with the same songs same mixes but mysteriously the songs have new titles but they are the same EXACT songs as the Frukwan album. Does Frukwan even know about this??? This is a blatant bootleg of Frukwan's ""Life""- the songs are ina different order, the names have changed - Who do they think they're fooling??? This is a blatant misrepresentation. They buried the Gravediggaz with this one one - 6 Feet Under indeed!! Couldn't they even think of a more original title? C'mon what the #$%* is up with this? I can't believe it. BUYER BEWARE"
1,New Gravediggaz CD,"I have to agree with WESLEY JONES, the 1st review of this album DECEPTION 6 previously released nightmare in a minor tracks with changed titles added to Frukwans solo work released on Empiremusicwerks which is deceptive. Now released on Cleopatra and X-ray records?? you say who do they think theyre foolin? misrepresentation? sure it is but what your calling a bootleg is the work of the man himself, of course he knows about it. I must add that its also disrespectful to the moniker and the memory of now deceased rapper Poetic"
1,Infringement,This is yet ANOTHER infringement. Releasing without consent or permission to gain profit or for any other reason is NOT according to Poetics wishes.
3,"Big Book, but it gets easily and often sidetracked about general dv filmmaking","I was suprised by the size of the book, in fact it was a little daunting at first, I felt overwhelmed at the amount of information. The content was good, but I think the book fell into the trap of trying to cover everything about filmmaking and as a result, it often diverts from HDV to cover general filmmaking. I specifically wanted to know about HDV and I found myself having to skip over many sections to search out the information that related to HDV. Overall I found it to be an interesting read, but I would have preffered a dedicated book about HDV as the title claims."
4,Comprehensive guide to Iceland,I went to Iceland in September and thought that this was a very good guide for those staying close to Reykjavik. We used the book primarily for references in and around Reykjavik. The information was accurate and thorough for our purposes.
3,"Good Book for the Average Tourist, not Good Enough for Me","I chose the Lonely Planet book on Iceland without hesitation. Well, it was a mistake.The book talks mostly about the places that everyone knows about. You just need to pick some pretty brochures up at the airport or in your hotel upon arrival, and you will have most of the information about the main sights as in the book, plus pictures (that are rare in the book).The not so well known sights are obviously not known by the author either. The information about the few mentioned is inaccurate. For me these hidden treasures are the reason to buy a tour book. Why spend money on a book for widely available information? I liked the author's good sense of humor, though.Iceland is fantastic! With this guide book, or without it, you definitely should go and visit the peaceful country and its nice people."
2,Outdated,"This book was written before 2010, therefore it's missing a lot of important cultural hallmarks in the city, such as the Harpa that was built in 2011. Also, several of the recommended restaurants have closed in the last 2 years.Could use more pictures."
3,C+,"The maps in this book are so small that I had to get out a magnifying glass, something I doubt I will take with me when I travel. The general information is helpful. I found a bed in the recommended guest house and their recommendation saved time. As an overview from which I can seek out further information when I am there it is useful. The maps are the real downfall."
1,"Hard to read, poorly organized (April 2004 - 5th edition)","I have been traveling all over Europe and usually Lonely Planet is the guide book you want to get. However, the book for Iceland is quite aweful. Most of the maps in the book are so small, I don't know how they expect anyone to really read them, much less the small font printed throuhout the book. Also the organization and lay-out of the book are highly lacking, which is usually one of the best features of the lonely planet books. I recommend anything else but this."
3,Good Content; Oddly Organised; Requires a Separate Map,I've just returned from a week tour of Iceland. The info in the book is quite comprehensive - only it takes some time to find it (the index is appalling and the sections are oddly organised). The maps are hopeless if you're driving. However the Insight Guide's flexi-map makes a good companion to the Lonely Planet Guide.
3,The colors are off,"The canisters are definitely cream when in the picture they appear white. Also, the lids are brown when they look black or blue in the picture. I was a little disappointed, but they have great seals in the lids."
2,Fun??,"It is hard to believe this book was written by an adult professional. Some of the activities suggested involve encouraging the dog to behave in undesirable ways, such as barking excessively, running wildly through the house, or attacking your shoes. Others, such as ""walking lessons"" where you grab the dog by it's legs and force him to walk, seem to border on abusive. I was looking for more activities to do with my Lab, and didn't find one."
3,OK but not Great,"I have large dogs and was not very impressed with this book. Most of the tricks require more than one person to assist in the game. I think the tricks would work better for someone with small dogs and small kids. I liked ""The Idiots Guide to Dog Tricks"" - I thought it had better instructions and more ideas than this book."
5,Not for those too serious to have fun with their dogs,"If you're looking for a very serious book and have absolutely no sense of humor, look for some other book. But if you're looking to have fun with your pooch, look no further. Coile writes some great books and Beyond Fetch is a great book for someone wanting to do fun activites with their dog.Some of these games are downright silly. Mind games, backyard games, and party games -- what did you expect? Vacations, outdoor adventures, and organized sports are all covered as well. Coile also covers dog toys and the best ways to relax with your pooch.Have fun, enjoy yourself, and have a howling good time!"
4,Pro sports caper fast-paced and twisty,"Gar Anthony Haywood, author of the superb P.I. Aaron Gunner series, used the pen name Ray Shannon to write FIRECRACKER. This story centers on Raygene Price, a superstar playing for the Dallas Cowboys. Contract negotiations are coming up, and Raygene has to keep his nose clean or else the NFL will exhile him. Reece Germaine is pregnant with his child and seeks support payments. Raygene balks. But Reece has a betting slip for the Super Bowl and a shot to win 1.25 million dollars in a payout if her team wins. Shannon moves around a large cast of complex characters (including Raygene's God-fearing body guard), and the boisterous climax in Las Vegas over the Super Bowl weekend is probably spot on. Well-written, deftly executed, and convincing dialogue, FIRECRACKER favorably compares to NORTH DALLAS FORTY and SEMI TOUGH."
1,this is a piece of crap,These shirts are so thin that you can see directly through them thats how cheesey it is.
3,in-depth knowledge of vampires in literature,Mr Frayling delivers a very entertaining analysis of the vampire in literature. I recommend this book as a starting point for deeper research
1,Too wide for my house,"This is not 28 inches wide as stated in the discription. This is the third one I have ordered, the second one I have given away as I am unable to repack it and return it. It is getting to be a very expensive propostion."
5,Great investment,My mother-in-law gets along great while pushing a cart at a store but struggles to walk at other times. We purchased this and she loves it! She goes to the park with us and just rolls right along. We had tried others at a few of the local stores and they were smaller. The seats were small and made of hard plastic. This one is quite comfortable. The tires on this are also large which helps when going over bumps. The smaller wheels were not at sturdy and she felt like she would fall. I would recommend this product.
3,I've had better,"I purchased a NOVA ""Mighty Mack"" 4216 Rolling Walker before I purchased this. I wanted a second roller for my yard and this was less expensive so I got it. It's not nearly as nice as the Mighty Mack. The Mack is more compact even though it can hold 200 more pounds. The legs on this roller spread out more than the Mack so it's hard to get through doorways. The seat flops around when you fold-up the roller which can cause you injury while handling the folded roller. The Macks seat doesn't flop around. The bottom line is: unless you are on a really tight budget and can't afford to spend more then spend the extra to get the Mack. It is a much better designed roller."
4,Very good,"Excellent, sturdy, comfortable. It is big . . . but it for big people. Difficult to fold up and get in a car . . .in fact it probably won't fit in anything but a big car or SUV. And it is too big to go through many doors. Having said that, it is an excellent product . . . but not for small spaces."
3,Sweet Potatoe Pie,"I was very satisfied with the flavor of this pie. Some of you bakers will think you make better, but it truly was delcious and delivered in texture and flavor. I would buy it again!"
1,A Total waste of time,"Installing the unit was very easy but getting it to work was fruitless. I moved it around, slot to slot with varied results but only once received a picture. Informed there were NO conflicts, but only twice had an OK from the test program. The only time I got video, was constant lock-ups of system, Having to go ""SafeMode"" and remove software to even get my computer to run, and after each re-do, lock up, again. After 4th card re-shuffle (once necessitating an ISA card move, to make room for a PCI slot). I finally removed the card, and packed it back in box. This was the second card (exchange) after numerous contacts with tech support on 1st card problems, who were of little help."
4,Good Software Ok quality,Althogh it has **GOOD** software I have seen much better quality what would have made me not care about quality is if would have came with better software like Avid Cinema. The Price is ***AWSOME***. If you buy this TV tuner card then you should also buy Avid Cinema!
3,Good video capture but lousy software,The .avi file produced with Studio PCTV can not be recognized by Avid Cinema v1.5 although they can be played in the Microsoft Media Player.
1,Stay away from this TV card if you use Win2K,"I have had nothing but problems with this card. The only piece of hardware in my machine that DOES NOT WORK. It will randomly lock up your machine. As for support, good luck. You might as well ask a monkey to help you. Don't believe me? Check out Pinnacle's forum for yourself."
1,software is terrible - harware only ok,"The included software is amateurish, poorly documented and buggy. Installation is difficult. The most common function, TV viewing, is barely supported and has poor channel controls and no preview pane. Other TV tuner cards include a remote control. Buy one of these for just a few dollars more."
3,Works fine but do not use Windows ME,"The card works quite fine for the price. Great if you only want to watch TV! I own a Pentium I 200Mhz with a S3 Virge (2MB) graphics card and 32MB RAM. Watching TV works really nice with this setup. WARNING : If you have Windows ME installed it won't work at all. I had Windows ME on my PC but had to downgrade it to Windows 98 for it work at all. On Win 98 there are still a few glitches though: 1. It's slow when capturing snapshots of your TV screen, it will actually do some disk paging and will get the picture but not the one you saw when you clicked the button but the one corresponding to a few seconds later. 2. It hangs when trying to capture video. ADVISE : You probably need better hardware than what I have. BEFORE YOU BUY : Check your graphics card is supported by Pinnacle. Not all the features (such as video capture) work with all cards."
1,This card has TONS OF ISSUES W/ XP,the pinnacle pctv is not good enough under XP environment. don't take my word for it. go check the product discussion group at (...) the customer support- anyone who ever called them knows this very well-is one of the worst you will ever encounter. all the gimmicks to keep you on hold and then they sometimes abruptly hang up on you .
1,Not good under XP,"Bought it for video capture, but never got that far. Only set up the TV funtion. Works great for a few minutes, then loses sound. Change channel sound comes back for another minute or two. Repeats over and over again.Using Windows XP, AMD Athlon XP 2500. Tried two different sound cards, including SB Live. Same results.Wouldn't recommend."
4,Surprised it works as advertised!,"I got it for [$] after rebate at CompUSA. Running it on a 2Ghz Pentium 4 with Windows XP. Installation and configuration was easy and the directions were pretty clear. Everything works, like time-shifting and recording. A tip: I created a separate partition on my drive just for video recording and caching. This way the data doesn't get fragmented and munged with all your Windows system files and you'll get a much smoother experience. The only problem is that in Windows XP, when you switch between users without logging out, the screen hiccups and it stopped recording. I think the picture quality is great; I see some noise patterns but then I also see them on my TV/VCR so I'm not blaming this product."
3,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for.","It works, but if you expect much more you may be disappointed.The PCTV features no deinterlacing at all, leaving image quality in the poor bin. Even on slower moving video it can become annoying. For basic functionality it works. It features RF tuner, s-video, and composite inputs all which work fine.If you're strapped for cash it will work, but if you can stand to spend a bit extra, the money may be better spent on an ATI TV Wonder or competing product. It's hard to rate it too low despite the image quality for the...price, so I'll leave a Three behind with a word of warning."
2,Free Unofficial Guide Is Better!,"This official guide rehashes most of the information included in the game manual. It does include some mechanics (like how scores are calculated) and strategies for the individual scenarios.If you want winning strategies that can be applied to most cases, download the very good Unofficial Tropico Strategy Guide from gamespot.com"
1,Disappointing strategy guide,"This strategy guide is a disappointment. Apart from strategies for the individual scenarios, the book is almost a complete re-hash of the game's manual. If you're looking for slightly more detail (or better proofreading) than in Tropico's manual and can't be bothered to look for the information online, then this book is for you. Otherwise, spend your money on something else."
4,"An engaging, quick, entertaining read","More party conversation facts that you can expect to collect from 99/100 other books. A great story, well told. Professionally and rigorously researched. Fun to read."
1,Not as advertized,"This was advertized as Neon Red coding labels, instead they were Neon Orange. We will use them but I feel deceived about what I ordered. I was looking for red and orange is not red. If you are looking for Red labels these are not what you are looking for."
4,Actually Going Fishing with Jesus,"Relates apathy in the church of Christ to story of his young son learning to watch a baseball game only by looking at the scoreboard (which the boy was so proud he'd just learned) without paying any attention to all the action on the field.Thus, out of stands and into the game, Christians. Good work on letting Jesus use each and every believer as a witness to their friends, relatives and acquaintances in our lifepaths.Great advice on focusing on salvation and not letting our witness get sidetracked and off-course with other doctrines initially with unbelievers.Liked his last chapter ""on helping rookies,"" the much needed talk about integrated new believers into the life of the church and congregation."
3,"Nice shape, but rather stiff and uncomfortable","These Florsheim shoes are a bit more modern looking than the old Florsheims of past. They do look relatively nice on the conservative side. However, they do not fit as well as Johnston & Murphy shoes (nor their craftsmanship can match those from J&M). The sides are a bit too high and often cut into the outer ankles when taking long strides. Just not very comfortable. Foam/gel inserts are highly recommended should anyone decide to buy them."
2,Seventy Scottish Songs,I was disappointed in this book as it did not have any of the well-known Scottish songs that I'm familiar with.
3,Mediocre at Best,"These flip covers get the job done, but they're very fragile. The spring, that keeps tension on the flip cap, had gotten loose within just a couple weeks of light use. I tried fixing it but I lost the spring when it flew out of my hands. I'm going to order a second pair. If they fail again then I'll give up on Butler Creek flip covers. I rather pay two or three times as much for a more durable product."
4,"Seen Better, Seen Worse","Product worked well, fairly cheaply made- but price was good. Quick shipping!A couple things that could be improved are the way it holds onto the dash- there is only 2 tabs at the top and one at the bottom to keep your radio in there. its pretty shallow so it makes your radio stick out a little and not properly ""latch"" into the radio cage. the vents are pictured but are not included, so be extremely careful when removing them from your factory dash,On the plus side, it was an extremely quick install, and easy! i would buy it again!"
4,Good overview and introduction,"As someone who works in marketing and understands HTML, WML, and CSS, I needed a good overview that would let me start to get my head around XML and its related acronyms. I think this book delivered on that pretty well. It's not really as long as 350 pages since there are a couple of long code listings.One thing that is very nice is the clean typography and layout of the O'Reilly books. The other publishers could take a lesson from them. When dealing with new, complicated subjects, whitespace really is your friend.I agree with some of the other criticisms in previous reviews but for the most part, this is a good first book."
2,"Describes XML, doesn't teach you to write XML","I was hoping for more, but this book does a good job describing all of the elements of XML. Not a book on writing XML."
2,who is this book intended for?,"Most O'reilly books are praised for describing computer programming concepts in a very readable way for an educated audience. Although, Erik Ray's book is engaging enough, he has left out so much detail in the language definitions and real examples that, after reading this book, it is not possible for even an experienced programmer to actually use the material. For example, the book explains the definition of schemas (without enough detail) but how do I use a schema in a project? The intended audience for this book appears to be people who already use xml that want a refresher at an elementary level. Very disappointing."
4,A good book for people interested in learning XML...,"I consider Learning XML by Erik T. Ray to be a first-rate book. I thought it was easy to read and full of useful information. This is an excellent book for people interested in learning about XML, not a book for experience XML users. This book introduces the basic XML concepts very well and has excellent examples to reinforce these concepts. It introduces the more complex concepts involved with XML but does not elaborate fully on them. Again, this is an introductory book."
2,Learning XML a review,"I purchased this book because (1) I want to learn XML, (2) I have a great many other O'reilly books and generally they are extremly informative. However, overall I was very disapointed with this book, I must say that I am still reading through it, but so far.. too much woffle, not nearly enough examples and those that are present dont appear to work correctly. Nothing is more fustrating than typing in both XML and an accompanying stylesheet, to find that either the XML will notvalidate because of unrecognised atributes, or that the page will not render sanely. I admit I am using Internet Explorer.. version 5.5 but the XML non-validations using a registered copy of XMLWriter are most fustrating.The ftp site examples also fail to validate or execute correctly.In addition.. am I the only person who has yet to see a practical example of XML in action?? ...All in All.. learning XML is a disapointment."
4,Great Book for Learning XML,This book taught me a lot about XML and how it is used in the digital publishing world. XML is not limited to web sites and is a great resource for businesses institutions and other publishing needs where a common format is needed for each and every document.I recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn more about XML and how it is used.
2,OK for XML; no help for Xpath or XSLT,"Decent introduction to XML with somewhat interesting historical tidbits thrown in. The chapters on Xpath and XSLT, however, are horrendous. You are likely to finish these chapters with less understanding of these topics than when you started."
4,"A nice enough book, but...","As with most O'Reilly books, the production/editing of this book is excellent. It is a great introduction to the technologies around XML, but doesn't really give you enough to get started with XML.For example, there is a great introduction to current XML parsers out there for XML, but you never really find out how to use them (granted, this may be the topic of a more advanced book...). What exactly do I do with an XML file? I'm not sure this question is really answered.Now don't get me wrong, I'm glad I bought this book, and I know this book will be a good reference source in the future. I'm just not sure this is the first place to stop in learning XML."
3,Well organized and thorough intro plagued with errors,This is a very good introduction to XML. The author provides good background explanations for the topics that need it and uses many good analogies and examples. Unfortunately there are many errors. Some of them are serious and obscure enough to confuse the intended audience. Do your self a favor - buy this book then visit the errata page listed in the preface. Make sure to read both the confirmed and unconfirmed pages. The editors need to be taken outside and pelted with donuts.
4,Good overview,"Learning XML provides a relatively useful overview of the topic, though it doesn't go that much in depth.I'm giving 4 rather than 5 stars because I found the discussion of entities and notations somewhat confusing."
2,"bad book, too much nonsense","full of nonsense in whole book.For example, xml schemas chapter is from page 108 to 164 about 60 pages, but realy useful w3c xml schema only take less 8 pages, others, useless, forget them.Hi my dear author,you have a lot of work to do, from simple to complex, how can you just give a long example and finish. Do you know ""learning"" means ***FOCUSING ON CORE***"
1,Review for CRAM101 - not for textbook itself - Don't buy!,"This review refers to Cram101 textbook outlines for Learning and Behavior by Mazur.This product is useless. Instead of summarizing the major keypoints of the chapters, it lists definitions of random terms in the textbook.The terms must have been selected by a computer and not have been reviewed by a person, as defintions for terms, such as cocktail party or anecdote, are listed. My personal 'favorite': Chapter 2 of the book discusses ""single neuron doctrine of perception"". The cram101 review defines ""Single"" (""in relationships, a single person is one who is not married, or more broadly, who is not in an exclusive romantic relationship"") and ""neuron doctrine"" (the latter definition does match the textbook definition)."
1,Nonmagical Venice Video,"While ""The Magic of Venice"" contains moderately interesting information, it is a somewhat amateurish affair. The film quality is poor, and the narrator mispronounces a good many Italian words. Suggest the price be lowered to a more modest $9.99."
5,"An empowering ""read"" for happy and healthy living!","An anthology of the profound wit and wisdom of women througout the ages; a ""must read"" for all women and a ""should read"" for all men who want to 'be in the know' about all women! A ""5 star"" book!!!!! Especially enjoyable because of its easy-to-use format of quotations arranged alphabetically by subject headings such as attitude, change, courage, faith, and friendship; especially inspirational because one should ""never be less than they are to earn another's love!"""
5,My Favorite Book!,"I just got this book and i have already become obsessed with dreams of building my own Rolling Home this summer. The photographs are all very beautiful, and the book is also full of great drawings and diagrams. Not much text, but what's there is very well written. This book has inspired me to live my life in a whole new, fun way. This is definately worth buying!"
5,Outstanding,"Have owned this book fot 15 years and always enjoy comming back to it. Touches the soul and keeps the dream alive. Makes sane, supposidly professional poeple contimplate alternative lifestyles. A keeper."
1,MAJOR RIP-OFF,I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.I PAID 30 DOLLARS FOR A BOOK MARKED $7.95 ON THE COVER AND $2.99 INSIDE.THIS BOOK IS NOTHING MORE THAN A COLLECTION OF OLD PHOTOS OF HIPPIE VANS FROM THE 70S.HAVING BEEN IN MY 20S DURING THAT ERA THE BOOK WAS HARDLY ENLIGHTENING.I WOULD GUESS THAT MOST OF THE VANS SHOWN HAVE LONG AGO VANISHED.I GUESS SOME PEOPLE WOULD FIND THIS BOOK WARMLY NOSTALGIC.I JUST FOUND IT BORING.
2,A let down- with uplifting prose,"Hey. Okay the writing of this book was beautiful, but besdies that, there isn't really much I can say about it.I thought the book had good possibilities, but some aspects of it were so random- like the ghost of her dead lover, why was he even there? Sorry. I liked the original idea of showing what a women with a geishas soal would be like in modern american society. But. . . that was really the only poignant idea in the entire novel! Sorry I just didn't think it was very good. I guess I'm to used to reading classical stuff."
2,"Shallow, indulgent...","For a good take on a character being haunted by a former lover, I recommend Scott Spencer's Waking the Dead. That book had its flaws too, but it did a good, convincing job of conveying that sense of being haunted and making it real yet unreal at the same time.As for this book, the haunted plot just sort of felt superimposed on a rambling tale of a self-absorbed girl who goes on a little too long about family stories, about all her own lovers and about how taken she is with her own body. Ego comes through but anything a little bit deeper is missing. For all the Geisha and Japanese-American details, this book felt to me like one of many that portray the twentysomething life in New York. And it was not one of the better ones."
2,English Mastiff DVD - Not great!,"I had a Mastiff some years ago and thought I would see if there was something new to learn since I just got a puppy. I found the DVD to be disinteresting and it seemed to be made by someone with a home editing program, instead of a professionally made flick. It may be useful for someone who has never had a large dog, but don't get it looking for anything unique. I thought the host was borish and the presentation was poor."
1,Way to much fluff not enough info,Well if you like your DVD to be real cheesy then this would be the one. There isn't much information about the breed on the DVD let alone they talk about the size the breed can get to but never show a full grown animal to compair. Was very disappointed in the DVD. I could have found more info on the breed by watching Turner and Hooch then the DVD.I would highly NOT recommend this to anyone.
1,Absolutely Awful - A Complete Rip-Off,"I threw this DVD away after watching it last night. Only 19 minutes address the Mastiff, and what little information is offered is a highly abbreviated version of what can be found in any book on the breed. Worse, only two Mastiffs are shown: a brindle puppy and a fawn puppy. The brindle sits on a table while the amateurish narrator talks about the breed and pets the puppy, and the fawn is shown padding around in a park (and taking a bath). The background music made me want to pull my hair out. If I could give this video zero stars, I would. This is the worst video rip-off I've ever encountered. Don't waste your money."
2,not worth the purchase,"I bought this thinking we would learn more about the breed itself, help w/ training trips, and learned basically nothing more than a normal puppy..."
5,Best Children's book,"This is my daughter's most-requested book, and it is so enjoyable I truly don't mind reading it five days in a row. I can't say that for any other book we own. The illustrations are beautiful, the text is very inspired, and I like the theme of perseverance. Ignis's personality seems so real, as does the little girl Cara's. With two children, I've bought or borrowed countless children's books, and this goes at the top of my favorites list. I wish Gina Wilson and P.J. Lynch would team up for another story."
5,Ignis Is a great read.,I have read this book and really enjoyed it. I have also read this book to a grade 1 class and they really enjoyed it. I feel that this book is great for all ages. I love the story-line and the fabulous illustrations. This will be a great addition to any collection.
4,Very Good Book,This book is excellent for the beginner spanish student who wants to improve his/her basic grammar knowledge through exercises or the intermediate student who wants to review basic principles. I found it a helpful supplement to my beginner spanish course.
3,Lots of editing mistakes,"Don't get too frustrated using this book. It's a good book for learning Spanish, but there are a lot of small mistakes which will make the process frustrating at times. In some places there are quiz questions related to words which weren't presented earlier in the book. However, it does contain good explanations of how and when to use different phrasing. I also appreciated the explanations of some patterns for irregular verbs. The real test will be when I travel to South America in a few weeks...!"
4,Great Survival Language/Grammar,"Good survival language books in Spanish are hard to find. This one combines practical language in everyday situations with grammar and dialogues. While the author must be Spanish, it still works very well for Latin American situations."
4,Just fine. I needed it for a class I am taking. It is the required text.,I like this particular text. As the title suggests it is very practical. Wiley does a good job with this type of thing.
4,Wonderful memory book,"It asks all the right questions to include in a memory book for a child. I bought it because it's in a 3 ring binder and I can add and remove pages. My only complaint (a very small one) is the cover which didn't appeal to me and the fact that there are no envelopes for stuff (i.e. hair from 1st hair cut). But because it's in a 3 ring binder format, I just added what I wanted."
2,very disappointed.,"I really couldn't stand this CD. It's full of half-truths, stereotypes, simplifications, and a few outright lies. They couldn't even spell many of the Beats' names (Peter Orlovsky as Peter Orlovski, Michael McClure as Michael McLure, Ann Charters as Ann Chambers, etc.). There is an annoying soundtrack that's too loud at some points. They really trash Kerouac. The commentary - which comprises half or more of the CD - is not up to par. There's really not much here to like.The only thing that keeps me from giving this one star is that it does have recordings of the Beats speaking - there are audio clips of Kerouac, Ginsberg, Burroughs, Ferlinghetti, Anne Waldman, etc. But the sound is murky at some points, the speakers are not identified well, and there is no listing of what each clip is and when/where it was recorded. And if you're into the Beats, you've heard much of this before.There are way better Beat CDs out there than this one. My advice is to buy one of them instead."
5,Excellent book,"This collection of short stories explores the nature of desire and attraction in a changing society avoiding the excesses of many writers in this area. The stories are well-written and the characters are memorable. I look forward to reading his novel, and I highly recommend this collection."
5,Superb Book,It's a great book that portrays the social reality of Nepal in a story form.Congratulation to Samrat for the superb book that he has given to us. I look forward to reading more of his books. Good luck!
4,TEACHING GUIDE,"I have worked with dozens of people from Nepal and know that they are very spiritual people and forms of God are present with them all times. The author gave me insight into how they were raised and how their society is changing but is still very traditional and interlaced in the old ways. Their dancing and festivals are wonderful right here on Saipan. I liked the book and the writing was strong and clear. In the stories, there are tenderness, love, confusion, anger, compassion, mercy, guilt, and all the other emotions and feelings that all humans experience in their lives. I have now added Kathmandu and the Himalayas to my travel list."
4,"Good story-telling, even if somewhat simplistic","The first three stories (chapters) were very engaging and quite enjoyable. By the sixth and seventh story - though each was different - it felt too familiar. Not necessarily predictable, but too much the same as before. The final story switching to first-person was strange and jarring at first, but by the end of the book seemed to ""work"". The book is definitely entertaining and makes Kathmandu and other areas of Nepal ""come alive"" even for those of us who have never been there."
2,"Tedious, hard to finish.","I love world literature and was hoping that I could get swept up in this book this summer. Unfortunately, I found it repetitive and a burden to finish. I got about halfway through and had to set it aside for a few weeks. As another review pointed out, the stories were approached with a similar voice that became tedious. For me, this was unbearable. I eventually finished the whole thing, but found myself counting the pages to the end."
2,not the best but keeps moving,"Though this book exlpores the changing face of Nepal as other readers have suggested I thought most stories weren't especially real. The stories did not really sink in. In contrast I would definitely recommend his other book ""The guru of love"". The short stories chug along but in fits and starts and don't seem too close to home. It seemed as if the the subject of sexual attraction was not delved into correctly. The characters seem to have the sexual attraction all of a sudden rather than transitioning smoothly over time and over the course of the story itself.The author seems rushed to finish his story in some cases."
3,Follow up and previous review,"This tape set is the same as All the Spanish you'll Need which I purchased about 6 months ago. After studying spanish here and in Costa Rica and re-reviewing the tapes they do contain flaws. The content is good for someone who wants to learn basic phrases and sentences. However, if you want to really learn spanish I'd go another route. The main flaw that I see now is that the pronuciacion is not correct, especially the V sound which on the tapes are spoken as a V...very bad and the inconsistant and excessive use of person pronouns (yo, usted) need to be fixed."
2,Disappointed,"This book is an excellent example of how to take a wonderful story and turn it into something close to [junk.] William Jordan is a decent writer with a fairly decent story. However, Jordan manages to spend most of his time trying to convice us of his intelligence. I don't know how many times he pointed out that he was a biologist. Big deal. At one point he brags about how his cold intellect allowed him to sacrifice the lives of animals all in the name of science. He also feels the need to recount how, as a child, he tied a dog's leg to it's tail and the dog became paniced and ran (painfully) away. I got as far as page 97 before finally giving up on this book. Sorry Mr. Jordan, I just can't buy this garbage you are trying so hard to sell."
4,A COMPLEX STUDY,"Biologist/writer William Jordan's exploration of his relationships with two beloved rescued cats, Darwin and Hoover, make for interesting, if complex, reading, with high and low points aplenty. Though Jordan is not without serious flaws in his treatment of cats (and, in the past, a dog, and other animals), ultimately, this book is a tribute to the cats who penetrated his scientific detachment and, as he himself admits, turned him into a human being. For anyone who does NOT love cats and cannot understand those of us who do, I recommend this book -- it just may result in your wanting to find out for yourself what it's all about, and if that is the case, you'll never regret it. For those who already love cats, A CAT NAMED DARWIN is an unusual and unique look at the relationships of one man and two cats, told in a style unlike any other. In either instance, I recommend the book."
3,A biologist gets a pet,"I'm not sure why I can read books about cats when a similar book about people would probably bore me to death. But that's just the price you pay for owning a cat (or two or three). Surprisingly, A CAT NAMED DARWIN ends with a sentimental hallucination that defies credulity. In fact, he has several hallucinations throughout the book (which aren't so mysterious when you realize he studied at Berkeley in the 60's and 70's). It's an entertaining read though, and you might compare it to Peter Gethers' THE CAT WHO'LL LIVE FOREVER."
5,GRIPPING,"A brilliant and intense confession, this book examines the tender and deeply personal process of learning to love a cat as a totally life changing experience. It is at times an insightful, humorous and poignant journey into loving and losing a cat. A true story and fascinating read from the mind of a scientist who attempts to explain and demystify our deep connection with cats."
4,Two completely different CDs,"While arguably quite the most addictively playable compilation in quite a while,these two CDs make rather strange bedfellows.DJ Spooney mixs disc one,which is a load of invigorating club tracks,most appealling of which are SFA's pleasant,catchy track Flowers,Roy Davis's haunting Gabriel and Dreem Team's The Theme.On the other side of the coin,Steve 'Smooth' Sutherland hosts the second disc,which,if you're expecting more of the same thing from disc one,will completely blow you away.Anticipating more swinging anthems,it is instead a baffling assault of hardcore gangsta-rap songs,sentimental tunes from the late '80's and soulful R'n'B numbers.It is all,however,great fun to listen to and well worth buying."
5,Going Home to Landscape,"I'm glad to find this book in Amazon.com and was able to get it for a very reasonalbe price. I bought the used copy as I almost always do. The used ones come in good condition and are delivered soon enough.Going ""Home to a Landscape"" by Filipina writers makes me proud to know that there's a group of good Filipino women writers who are able to produce a book about Philippine culture. I'm a Filipino. I'm proud to be a Filipino. Like my husband, I'm a good American too. Good books like this by Filipino American writers contribute a lot to the arts of both countries. Keep the good work, Ladies. Mabuhay!Fini Jordan"
3,Poor Design,"Before ordering this product, I called Pop & Lock to verify that the PL2310 would fit my 2004 Ford Ranger. Everything fit find until I tried to unlock the tailgate and could not remove the key. The recess portion of the tailgate handle was keeping the Pop & Lock from turning all the way to the unlock position. In order to get it to work I had to grind a section of the tailgate on the right hand of the handle so that the PL2310 would unlock properly and the key could be removed. After this modification, the PL2310 worked perfectly. If Pop & Lock would redesign the lock bracket and lower the lock by 1/4"" on the bracket the need to grind the tailgate could have been be avoided. Other than this, I am very happy with the product."
3,Fair.,The Device is Fairly effective. However it would be better if the lock engaged both latches rather than just one.
4,Pop & Lock 2310,"Bought this for my 2004 Ranger Tremor. 25 minute installation, using basic hand tools, flat head screwdriver, 10mm socket wrench, #30 torx wrench. Only had to modify the lock by filing down the lock blade to fit perfectly. A medium to small metal file may be needed to make the ""fit"" just right. Overall I really like the product and the ease of installation."
1,Not for Metal Handle Latches,"Only after reading the instructions did I discover that this is the wrong model. The picture and the description for both models is exactly the same. The correct model DID NOT appear on the list when I found this model on the website. I cannot exchange this for the correct item and must pay an additional fee for a refund. Because this is not my fault, I will take my business elsewhere."
4,No Appendectomy Needed!,"Many English Bible versions are reviewed, but the best article in my view is Appendix 1: Zeal to Promote the Common Good (The King James Version) by Roger A. Bullard. Bullard suggests that the use of charity instead of love in 1 Corinthians 13 ""might be the influence of the dogmatic Andrew Downes, who had come over from the Apocrypha committee and joined the group doing the Epistles"" (p. 190). Also helpful is Appendix 2, A Comparison of Versions by Lloyd R. Bailey, Sr. Under ""accuracy of translation,"" it ranks by percentage of correctness among ten versions, including the KJB, NASB, and NIV, on Isaiah 7:14."
3,A little disappointed but functional enough,"The real measurement is 18"" [the longer tray side] x 2.5 x 13"" (expandable to 23""). I was disappointed that it did not fit my drawer the way I intended leaving extra space and not arranged the way I desired, none of the measurements in the descriptions seem to match up. It's made of decent enough wood but it's definitely a little flimsy. Every time I open the drawer, it expands sometimes throwing utensils off, I suppose that's because I couldn't get it to fit the way it's intended. I am considering returning it because of the measurement problem and I don't know if it would hold up if I could fit it the right way."
4,good product,"Perfect for my drawer. Only one problem - the vertical space wasn't long enough for my butter knives. Had to use the horizontal space. Other than that, sturdy and good looking."
4,Worked out great but not as intended,"We bought this intending to use it in our cutlery (and accessories) drawer but found the rectangular compartments in the center to be too large for cutlery storage. Not only was the cutlery moving around when the drawer was in motion, but it was taking up more space in the drawer than was necessary. (Form-fitting storage trays are better suited for cutlery, so that it can stack.) We did use this tray in our cooking utensil drawer however, and it's working out great. Amazon delivery was on time as usual."
4,nice but fragile,"I like the look of this tray a lot - but unfortunately one side of the wood came off when I was adjusting it for the 1st time right out of the packaging. I believe it would have been easy enough to glue but heck, I paid for a new undamaged one so I returned it and am awaiting a replacement from amazon. It looks good & the description of size (large) is accurate, just be careful when you maneuver it before placing it into your draw... I'm sure once it's in my draw I won't have any issues with the thing breaking"
5,Good product,"Fits great in my drawer, it's much larger than I expected - make sure you get out your measuring tape. It's not amazing quality or anything, but it seems pretty high quality for something that resides in a drawer."
2,Cheap,"Cheap, sides disconnect from the middle section and seems to take up more space in the drawer then its worth"
4,good for us,"This was the perfect thing for us, we had a very wide drawer that was always a mess and a bulky style of silverware that didn't fit traditional trays we..."
4,"Nice, though taller than expected.","It is a nice organizer. Looks and feels high-end. However, I was stupid and didn't measure the height of my drawers and it was too tall for the original drawer I intended. But, liked it so rearranged some drawers so I could keep it and make it work. The expansion is nice and also provides flexibility to change width of the two outside areas, in case you wanted one bigger than the other."
3,"Neat idea, but knives get stuck underneath dividers","I really like the fact that this tray expands to fit different drawers, etc. but this also has a drawback: thinner items (like knives) slide underneath some of the dividers, and get jammed there. This makes them fairly hard to get out, and I find it annoying. I've reorganized my cutlery several times in order to put the knives in the compartment where they get stuck the least.Not the end of the world, but if you're easily annoyed by design flaws, this might bug you on a daily basis."
1,Fell to Pieces,Item arrived with one of the adjustable trays needing to be fixed[no problem]. Once being used in a drawer on a daily basis the unit start to come apart again and again. I used this to replace a rubbermaid plastic tray but had to return to using the former. I would guess that this tray can not hold any more utensils than is shown in the product picture.
4,perfect organizer,"Love my flatware organizer ... In fact, I'd give it 5 stars except for the fact it's not all that deep. Works perfectly, well built, and does the job."
2,Error- filled analysis,"This original article has now been made into a book. The aim of the article was to expose the Israel lobby as major determiner of an American foreign policy. The major contention of the authors is that this pro- Israel influence has led to a disastrous American foreign policy including the war in Iraq and generally sour relations with the Islamic world.The article is filled with errors of conception and perception.It misconceives the nature of radical Islam, the world-wide terror threat to the U.S. It systematically ignores the major contributions Israel has made to U.S. security operations in the Middle East. Israel may not as General Keegan has said be worth five C.I.A's but it has provided 'intelligence' which has helped keep moderate pro-American regimes in power. The authors also deride the historic US -Israel moral alliance based on common democratic values.A shoddy and shameful piece of work."
5,My mother enjoyed the movie.,She is old favorite of my mother. I grew up watching my mom gloved this movie she has watched over ans over.
4,Good advice for business owners,"I first came across this book at my local library. I decided to purchase my own copy after reading the first few chapters and realizing that the information was applicable to my consulting business. Overall I found it to be a very good book with many useful ideas and techniques to grow my business. The only thing I did not like was the authors use of simple diagrams scattered throughout the book. I found them distracting and often hard to interpret. This is a good book for any professional that may be good in their given field/profession, but maybe not so good at marketing or networking themselves."
5,"Excellent, well written, practical guide",The author has a great style and offers much more that theory.This is a well written pratical guide on how to... read it!
2,Very Unconvincing!,"Palma does an excellent job outlining the Classical Pentecostal position; however, you can not take one verse at the exclusion of another. The bible contains twenty six accounts of Holy Spirit baptisms with only three references of speaking in tongues. Even with all the big words, I am unconvinced (write to express not to impress)."
4,Harmonic mid-60s Pop Sound,"The reviewer who cites this as a ""pre-Beatles""-sounding group is mistaken. The Symbols have an obvious Beatles-Hollies influence in their vocals, with a bit of The Association thrown in. If you like strong group harmonies with a late-60s production sound... here's your album. P.S. anybody who buys a disc because the cover shows the group dressed in psychedelic fashion expecting to hear something like Pink Floyd needs to learn how to audition before buying! Dear child of the 90s: EVERY group dressed like that in 1967!"
3,THE GREAT JOHNNY ACE,HE WAS THE GREATEST R&B SINGER I EVER SAW PERFORM AND I HAVE SEEN THEM ALL.R&B WAS JOHNNY'S MUSIC & STYLE IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE BLUES WAS OR IF YOU NEVER HAD A CASE OF THE BLUES AFTER YOU HEARD JOHNNY SING YOU KNEW ALL ABOUT IT.

4,Just Awesome!!,"My Kid has had it for over 6 years and still loves it.. He does not play with it, but keep it close to him.."
3,Son was never interested,"My son got this toy for christmas, but he never really played with it. he just spit up on it. I have put it up for another baby just in case our next might like it."
4,The wife is happy - so I am too.,"Seems to be a good hair straightener, wife says she can do her hair 20 minutes faster now. I believe her."
1,Don't waste your money,Not worth the money --- I tried 2 of them --- had to return them both. Buy the Ceramic Tools unit at $35.00 --- Its so much better and lighter to handle.
3,Chi Turbo 2-inch,"Just what we ordered but wife now says she wished she ordered the 1-inch version as this one is ""too thick"""
4,Great!,"Well, funny thing. The first few times using this iron, it wasn't really making my hair straight...then I noticed the temperature control. Even though it was at the highest, I moved it to the lowest temp then back to the highest temp, and it heated up fully. LOL! Now it works great! I love it."
4,Chi review,"My daughter has extremely thick and curly hair and it was taking her over an hour using other straighteners and then having to go over her hair again the next morning. With this Chi Turbo, she is only taking 30-35 minutes now and has to only take one session."
5,Great Product,This was a really good purchase. It was for my daughter who has a thick head of hair. It works really well for her and is extremely well made and very heavy duty. Worth the money.
5,Nothing else compares!,"I got this straightener as a Christmas gift in 2007. The 2"" flat irons are hard to find. I use it at least 4 days a week and it straightens my thick, wavy hair incredibly fast and leaves it straight and shiny. Dropped it numerous times, once even cracked the plug and repaired with electrical tape. I suspect that the plug is shorted inside the straightener as it stopped turning on, but I also wrap the cord around to store it so most likely my fault. If this is a ""fake"" Chi or coated ceramic, then they definitely have me fooled. Tried to replace it but honestly nothing else compares!!"
1,FAKE. NOT WORTH THE MONEY,Unforunately I recently bought this Flat iron. It seemed fishy to me so I contacted the Chi company directly. They do not make this brand and so this is a fake product. I certainly didn't pay 100$ for a fake brand. In the process of getting it returned. Thanks for letting us know it's real or not
1,Straightener,It gets hot but doesn't straighten my lhair easily.My 1 inch that cost me $40 works better. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and we were both very disappointed.
1,NOT NEW,"I would leave a zero if I could. It is missing the side round peices that say CHI, and I have had four Chi Irons now and this on is definately not new. So not happy!!!!"
3,Loved it while it worked.,"I would give this product 3 1/2 stars if I could. I had this straightener for about 2 1/2 years before it stopped working. It worked amazing while it worked, but it always seemed cheaply made. This was my first Chi product and was surprised by the low quality of it. However, as I said it worked very well when it worked."
1,Chi failure,I bought this for my wife. Happy wife happy life. She was not happy . Product stopped working after 25 days. Would not turn on. I would not recommend this model. Supplier is sending a replacement. If it had not failed within 30 days would not have received a replacement more than likely.
1,STILL WAITING FOR MY PRODUCT,"It is now March 14, 2011 and I have not receive THIS product. I ordered this on Feb 2.......unless it's being ship from JAPAN there is no excuse. My emails have not be answered. Amazon SHOULD REMOVE them from their web-site, how irrisponsible can a company/person be! This makes Amazon just as LIABLE! Don't you verify credentials and ethics of a company on YOUR website.I should have heeded the previous opinions."
4,Very Pleased,"I bought this flat iron after deciding that it would be less expensive to do my hair as opposed to going to the salon. I have not had any problem with this flat iron and it works very well on my hair. I have not noticed any damage, but I also use a heat guard spray by CHI on my hair before I flat iron it. I would highly recommend this flat iron to anyone but especially African American women who are interested in quickly straightening their hair."
3,2 times a charm,"Bought as a Christmas present for wife. She used it the first time and it quit working halfway through. Half her head was straight as a board, the other half curly as hell, which resulted in me having to go to walmart at midnight to buy one for her to finish with. Amazon replaced it with a new one shipped over night; I had it the next day before lunch. Very impressed with Amazons customer service! The replacement is working fine now."
1,Cheap knock off!,This was a big FAKE! The first day I used it the velvet pannels started to slide off making it a big gooy mess! I was very dissapointed I really thought I had totally scored! I did request for a refund and sent the flat iron back but have yet to receive a credit back. I am very surprised Amazon allows these companys to sell to their clients. I have bought many items but have never in the past had this bad expirence!
1,Don't buy from them,"Yes the Chi Straightener is awesome and well worth the money, but do not buy from this company. I got the turbo 2 inch and when it arrived it was broken. I had a replacement sent to me but when that straightener came in... not only was it the wrong (1 inch instead of 2 inch) but it was ALSO broken like the first. They sent me a full refund once I returned both straighteners...But my point is buy this product from a more responsible company."
1,Not a happy customer,I purchased this CHI flat iron in June and it has already quit working. I learn today when I check return policy that the return date expired in July. I am very upset because this is not a cheap flat iron. We are not talking fifteen dollars we are talking $100.00 dollars. I will never purchase something like this again on Amazon. I will go through my hair stylist from now on. So in other words I have thrown 100.00 out the window.
2,old style was made better quality,I owned a 2 inch Chi (the exact same one) for 6 years. It lasted me so long and I loved it! I even convinced about 10 of my friends to buy one. Now 6 years later when mine stopped working I had to order a new one. I am not sure if they produce these irons in bulk but the materials used on the iron I received was poor. Holding the two next to each other and playing with then you can tell the difference immediately. It feels like it was cheaply made and not as solid. It also did not get as hot as my old one did. I used to love the CHI but i am not sure what they are doing with their production now 6 years later. I had to send it back. I now have moved onto a GHD 2inch and seem to like it so far. I wish I liked the CHI I got but it just was not the same as my old one. :-(
2,Not Happy,"I purchased the Chi for my sister, she is not happy with it at all. For some reason hers does not got hot even on the highest setting. She wants to send it back. She has purchased a CHI in the past and it worked 100 times better. i love my CHI which was also purchased on Amazon. Maybe hers is defective."
1,Threw that money away.,"I bought this as a replacement for almost identical CHI. Almost being that things appeared cheaper and the logo a little different. Thinking it was just a silly thing I kept it. As of 1 week after the return deadline the iron stopped working. I tried in different outlets, tested the button on the plug and it is dead. I feel ripped off and hope no one else will lose the $100 on this item."
4,Good flat Iron,"I'm black with natural, kinky hair and this flat iron definitely does what it's supposed to. The only downside is it doesn't last for long. Overall pretty good product."
4,Chi Straightener is A-ok,"I think this is great, the size is amazing, however it does't heat up as hot as I would like, but still does the job. When my hair is still a little damp it doesn't sizzle like others did which is nice. My last flat iron was an infrashine and that was much hotter."
4,"Good, but weighs hair down","It does what it is supposed to. Hair is pin straight without much effort.However, maybe its better for people with heavier, more kinky hair. Mine is wavy but soft and gets oily after a day of being 'chi'ed' and has no volume at all. But in comparison to all other flat irons I've tried, this is by far the best."
4,Seems to work fine. Does a fast job.,Bought it for my girlfriend She likes it. Works good for her. She has long thick hair and it good does a good job.
1,Horrible experience!,The first iron I had melted my hair and burnt out on the first use...the replacement also burnt out the first time I used it. I do have bad luck but...this is rediculous. The only upside was the great customer service by Amazon (even though I had to pay to ship both irons back). Do not buy CHI products.
1,crap! Don't buy,This product is a piece of crap! I had it less than 2 weeks when it burnt out. Save your money!
1,do not rec,"I purchased this straightner last dec for my 21 year old daughter. We have used chi products for years, so we are familiar with the brand. Bought this with the idea it would last for years as chi typically does. within 7 months my daughter called and said the plates were sliding off the handle and glue was everywhere. Of course she didnt keep the box,and looking at the website it was too late for return per policy. I was excited to get such a great deal, but im thinking this was not a chi product, but a knock off. $120, is alot to spend on a straightner that only lasted months and not used regular."
2,Not half as good as original 2 inch Chi Turbo flat iron,"I thought I was happy to find another 2 inch Chi Turbo flat iron to replace the original one I have owned for at least seven years. BUT this one is not as heavy as the original, therefore, the paddles do not grab the hair as tightly. The paddles also move back and forth like they are loose. I am disappointed with it! But since my hubby fixed the electrical cord on my original 2 inch Chi Turbo, I will keep this one as a back up. I have extremely thick and fuzzy hair so must use a 2 inch flat iron to cut the straightening time in half."
2,CHI Straightening Iron,"I love this straightener, however, I would not advise buying the Turbo. Why? CHI continually has problems with the cord connection. Sometimes it stays on, sometimes not. I am continually frustrated with making sure I hold the iron in a certain spot so that it heats up quickly. The regular CHI does not have this problem. I've had 3 Turbos and all did the same thing. However, when the red light stays on, it's a great iron."
1,Buyers Beware!,I have never been inclined to write a bad review nor ever thought I would. But I think it would be so helpful to people that want the 2 inch CHI flat iron.* buyers beware: I called CHI and they told me that they no longer make the 2 inch version of this flat iron.[...]I was extrememly dissapointed to find this out as my authentic CHI 2 inch flat iron was the best flat iron ever. I have long and thick hair and the 2 inch straightened my hair perfectly and I could do it in about 20 mins. as opposed to a smaller iron. After it lasted about 4 years plus it finally stop working so I wanted to order a new one. I looked for a good deal and came across this seller. When I got the flat iron I was so excited but then disappointed greatly at the results. It was not working nearly as well as my 1st one after a few times I got curious and checked the Internet and made some calls. Verdict: You can order a fake CHI flat iron and CHI no longer manufactures the 2 inch flat iron.
4,2 inch Turbo Straightener,I have been using the 2 inch straightener for less than a month and for the most part am satisfied with the performance. I like the safety feature of suede around the edges so you don't get burned on your scalp or face when you go for the close to scalp hairs. But what I don't like is the fact that I cannot get more of a curl at the ends now because of the 2 inch width. If all you care about is straight hair...this is a good product and you will like it. If you want more flexibility...stick with 1 to 1 1/2 inch straightener.
5,The best flat iron I have ever used,"I have been straightening my hair for about 15 years and have tried many different flat irons. I am african american and my hair is about 4 inches away from being to my waist. I got this iten yesterday, flat ironed my hair today and it looks just like it looks when I leave the shop. I have very curly thick hair and have never been able to get it as flat as the shop does. The problem with the shop is, they charge me extra becuase my hair is so long. This is worth every penny, and it will save me so much money. The last ceramic flat iron I bought pulled and snagged my hair, this was so smooth. amazon offered a great price, the retail store by my house had it priced twice a much."
5,Great!! FIVE STAR!,"LOVER IT. i got mine today and i was so excited, rite now im sitting here with great hair, can't wait to use it when school starts. Order the 2 inch if you have thick long hair and 1 inch if you have medium hair. worth everypenny, only thing i don't like is that i need a high heat to straighten fast which makes my hair feel hot for a good 10 secs so i can't touch it w/o feeling like im gonna burn myself, but if you don't have thick curley hair like me you prolly wont' need the high setting=] very happy"
3,worked once maybe twice,"Gave this to my daughter for Christmas and she used for a brief time Christmas day and then when she went to use it the next day it never turned on again....Bought another one, same model from another vendor and she says it works great."
4,Good product at a reasonable price,I bought this for my 12 year old daughter after researching many different models and brands. She has hair down to the middle of her back and it is on the thicker side. She is very happy so far with this straightener. I asked my hair salon about this brand and they had good things to say about it. They did recommend buying a protective spray to put on her hair before using the iron to keep the moisture in her hair. I did this and so far we are very happy overall.
3,Not the best choice for medium length hair,"This flat iron did not do well with my medium length hair. I think the 1"" would have been a much better choice. but I found this one on sale at Amazon for $74 and couldn't pass up such a bargain.It does heat up super fast and is very lightweight and feels good in my hands. If you have longer, thicker hair I think this would be an excellent choice."
5,Well Worth The Money!!!,My college-aged daughter asked for this item for Christmas - I'd never heard of it. She let me try it.... Whoa!!!This is an iron that is worth every penny!!! Straightens hair smooth and shiny in a very short time.
5,Great Flat Iron,"This ia a fabulous flat iron, better than any you can buy at your local store. Expensive, however Amazon's price is a bargain. Straightens hair beautifully. Very pleased!!"
1,Farouk CHI GF1539 Turbo Big 2' Ceramic Flat Iron,"I purchased the Chi Farouk 2"" flat iron for my daughter for Christmas. The flat iron did not work at all and one of the ceramic tiles was set crooked. I'm not sure how this item passed any inspection. Very poor craftsmanship. My daughter was very disappointed."
3,A bit disappointed....,"It does not work as well as I had expected, especialy for the price you're paying for this product. You could probably find a cheaper one that works better."
1,It's a fake Chi!,"This Chi Turbo is a fake Chi. I returned it and got a full refund and the people from the company are really nice, but don't waste your time ordering this product b/c it's not real."
2,Not worth the money,"This straightens hair but doesn't smooth as well as hoped, especially considering the cost. The one I've had for 4 years does a better job."
1,Don't Believe The Hype,"This product may be good for others, but was HORRIBLE in my opinion. The iron did not get very hot and it didn't get my hair straight at all. I sent this product back immediately for a refund. I will continue to use my Maxi-Glide and get fabulous results. The CHI is a no-go in my book."
5,Farouk Flat Iron,Item arrived quickly and well packaged. I love the Flat Iron and it really was worth the price.
3,Not the highest quality,The on and off switch was on reverse and sometimes didn't shut off unless I unplugged it. The unit didn't close on hair completely causing alot of hair pulling. I returned it.
1,A complete waste of money,I thought I would save a few dollars buy buying this cheaper version of the CHI; however i ended up throwing money down the toilet. this is obviously a fake/knock-off CHI and has the straightening power of a the cheapest flat iron you could pick up at wal-mart. BOOO!!!
5,excellent flat iron,"this is an excellent flat iron. the first time i used it i could see the difference compared to store bought flat irons. it left my hair straight and soft, no fly aways or dryness !!!! salon quality from your own home : )"
5,The best!!,"I love this straightner! I have very thick,coarse hair and it took forever to straighten. I took a chance on the CHI straightner and it easily cuts my straighting time in half. It was well worth the money, even though it much more than I've ever spent on a straightner before. From now on, I'll only use this straightner!!"
1,NOT WORTH IT!!!,It worked well for about three months...It will not heat up at all after that...Bad investment!!! It is not worth the money. I would not buy another one. You can buy the regular one for $15 and it will last longer.
3,It heats up but that is all I found acceptable.,"I don't really like the 2-inch size. I thought I would prefer it because it would be a faster process, however the handling was difficult and awkward."
3,Chi straightener,"I'm a teacher so spending over $150 on a hair straightener was a lot for me. It does leave my hair silky smooth and it doesn't leave a burning smell in my hair. However, it definitely doesn't get that hot so it takes me longer than usual to straighten my hair. I feel like with today's technology and spending so much money on it, it should get a little hotter. Shoot, for over $150, it should straighten my hair and turn it into 18k gold! Not quite worth the money. My $20 Conair straightener didl as well in half the time."
2,NOT LIKE MY OLD CHI,"I had previously owned a CHI. So after five years when it died, I bought another. It WAS NOT like the old one. There were misspelled words in the directions, the felt on the outside was peeling and kept catching my hair and it would not stay warm for longer than three seconds before it would need to heat itself back up. So I returned it and bought a Baybliss and am very happy with it."
5,"Remarkable Collection, Incredible Career","Amazing collection of some, but not all of The Killer's best. The major draw for a Jerry Lee fanatic is the 1952 recording; the first appearance, the 'rookie card' of recording. From the teenage Jerry to the full fledged Killer you cannot think Rock N' Roll without Jerry Lee Lewis and later on you cannot visit a Honky Tonk without hearing his gut wrenching vocals. Face it, this is an easy purchase --- this is Jerry Lee Lewis how can it be bad?"
3,The Killer,"This set is over billed and is missing a lot of hits also the sound of the sun material is not good they sound better on the coletable set but well worth it for the rarities should have been a four disc set where is ""Hot Damm I'm A One Woman Man"" and the ""Rock And Roll Medley""?"
3,"useful and detailed, but tedious and over-explained","Roughly summarized, Readers, Teachers, Learners is a useful book with well-chosen accounts of different techniques for introducing topics, activity types that help make information stick, making the most of writing, guiding reading and research well, etc. However, it's a bore to read; when laying down VERY BASIC important concepts, it drones on and on about the obvious. Approximately the same amount of detail is used to explain activities and techniques, which is sometimes useful (but one still wonders what reading level and maturity level it's designed for). In short: good content and no concision."
5,Excellent book,"This is an excellent introduction to hyperbolic geometry. It assumes knowledge of euclidean geometry, trigonometry, basic complex analysis, basic abstract algebra, and basic point set topology. That material is very well presented, and the exercises shed more light on what is being discussed. Plus, solutions to all the exercises are at the end of the book."
4,An Oldie but a goody,"I just discovered Laura Van Wormer's books in a dusty little corner of a cozy used book store.Picked up several and put them in chronological order andRIVERSIDE DRIVE was the first.The author's debut it turns out.What a good solid read.Characters, colorful and fully drawn. The flavor of the city.The news biz. The ugly face of alcoholism.The warmth of friendship. The joy of new love, thesadness of love gone bad.A grand soap opera, but with a realness to the characters, their reactions to life's slings and arrows.This was written in 1988 and is perhaps a wee bit dated in someof the attitudes. But if you can let yourself timetravel a bit, you won't notice:}"
5,Elaine Landau,A terrific dinosaur book that any young child would love. The obviously gifted author combines a fascinating text with fabulous illustration. This book is a favorite of mine and my 10 year-old son.
5,"For best results, view repeatedly","On first viewing I was torn between fascination and frustration with this video. Horrendous editing of excellent songs (e.g. cutting the last 20 seconds off ""great cop"" and giving us only the first and last notes of ""smallpox"")seemed designed to disappoint their fans, and mar what is otherwise an entertaining and thoughtful look at what is probably the most interesting American rock band. But as is typical of Fugazi recordings, a second viewing expanded my original perceptions and I thought maybe the director was right to cut the hits and focus on the instrumentals. The third time through I realized this video is priceless. Although I still want the last 20 of great cop."
3,Way Over-Directed,"Fugazi is one of the best live bands ever. This doc tries way too hard to mimic Fugazi's arty rhythms. When the band is rocking on stage; all is right. Everything else in this piece is fuzzy and aggressively tweaked. When this movie cuts away from the onstage action, it struggles to find a point. A live-performance piece would have been more powerful. This piece kinda flops around. Ian almost uses political-correctness as a kind of goofy performance art. Still, Fugazi was the best live show I've ever witnessed-and this film shows a bit of that. Fanatics need only apply"
3,format hassles,"i wish this was available in a format that would enable me to watch it, having bought the soundtrack six months ago."
3,The Grateful Dead of Punk,"Well, it starts out with good footage of a show in Washington state. They then hack off the end of the song they are performing. Everything in this film segways into something else. After a while it gets on your nerves. While this is going on Fugazi is trying to shove their left leaning politics down your throat. There is one scene where a woman in her 40's a guess dosen't know anything about Fugazi, but is at the show because she heard about them on NPR. Sheeesh. One scene that is interesting, is when some kid spits on Ian MacKaye and the kid is dragged from the audience by Ian, and is asked to apologize for his actions. The kid dosen't apologize and he is promtly booted from the show. This could have been a great dvd, unfortunately egos and so called art got in the way. HEY FUGAZI, shut up drink a beer and play the music that I like. Leave the politics to the corrupt politians."
5,Excellent deflapper,A heavy duty unit that can stand up to prolonged use. A bit heavy but not enough to be a problem when installing it. It's worked perfectly and my only regret is that I didn't get it sooner.
2,Doesn't hold up,"These deflappers are okay if you have mild breezes, but then you don't really need deflappers for that. I'm a fulltime RVer and live in the desert. My awning is out all the time with a screen room attached. These deflappers will not hold up to the winds we get here. The strap rips in two. I have gone through two sets of these with the same results. The company makes a smaller version of deflappers that hold up much better but you have to use twice as many. Since the smaller version is half the price of the larger ones the net cost is the same."
3,Well made.,"Well made, but too heavy. Too much material in the clamp, weights down the awning. Several of the small clamps would be better."
3,Knobs stripped excellent otherwise.,"We owned (just sold it) a 2003 Trail Lite and I purchased this to help keep our awning tight and secure. The first couple of times I used this they were great. But the knobs are very cheap. This weekend, when setting up the camper for a potential seller the knob on one of the units twisted right off leaving a bolt as the only way to tighten the clamp. Granted I used a small crescent wrench and it accomplished the mission but I was very disapointed in the product. If they could fix the stripping problem, as identified by some other reviews, I think this would be a five star product. Now I need to find another set as the buyer took these, stripped and all, with the old camper."
3,awning flapper,"The item is okay, but does not allow for sufficient adjustment to put tension on the awning."
1,Complete crap!,"We put these on in a no wind situation just to see how they worked, both broke instantly. Made of cheap plastic. I would not recommend this product."
3,Not For The Layman,"I would like to preface this review by stating that I bought this book as an introduction to a topic I know nothing about. So the fact that it didn't grab me may have as much to do with my expectations of it being an introductory book to anarchism (which it clearly isn't)than anything else. The author obviously has a deep understanding of the theory and history of anarchism but the reader must have at least a fundamental understanding of the topic before jumping in.In my experience a good author can make a difficult topic easily understandable but he failed to do this. I gave this book 3 stars because, in this case, the failings were equal on the part of both author and reader. I would be interested in suggestions other readers have on a good introductory book to the topic because,as the title states, this book is not for the layman."
4,solid intro,"This is a very good introduction to anarchism. It covers all the bases. Granted, it's a bit messy structurally, but it doesn't detract from the read. This will also point you to tons of other texts. Its a great place to begin and to keep on hand if your friends, or enemies, have questions!"
5,A Brief History of Anarchism,"Wonderful overview of the ideas and actions of anarchism. Includes commentary on the Russian Revolution, Spanish Revolution, the distinctions between libertarian and authoritarian socialism, and the words of such essential thinkers as Proudhon and Malatesta, to name only a few. Also includes a brief but enlightening introduction from Chomsky that serves to place anarchism and its historical development in a broader and historical context. All in all, a worthwhile and valuable contribution for those searching for information on this neglected (at least in the United States)component of political/philosophical discourse."
1,Product misidentified,"Product misidentifiedThe web page describes the product as Eau De Parfum Spray Deodorant but is actually, I'm very disappointed.Upon receipt of the package it back"
5,Tresor,I was very pleased with the product AND the delivery time regarding this purchase. A VERY good seller! I had NO problems whatsoever and will definitely be a return customer!
1,Bummed,Spray pump stopped pumping after about 3 uses love to know if anything the manufacture/or sales can do? Will determine if purchased again.
4,Smells Great! Great Value!,This smells great. This was a great value compared to the prices that others have. It looked exactly like the picture - even the packaging.
3,tresor,Bottle was only 75% full. Am a little bummed out about that. Guess I should expect that considering it was a bargain?
2,Lousy customer relations,"Delivery of this item was promised between Dec 23rd and Dec 29th; however, the seller (CP Cosmetics) did not have the item in stock, and did not inform me of this (via email msg) until Dec 28th. As a result, I did not receive this Christmas present until a week after New Year's Day. Bummer."
5,Great Price for a great product!,"I just love the smell of Tresor and am always looking for a good price for it, as it is normally quite expensive...well, i finally found what i was looking for. it's a delightful smell, not heavy at all. it came relatively quickly which i appreciated..also, i signed up for an amazon card, which came with a bonus of $30.00 which made my purchase less than $5.00!! Thank you Amazon.com!!"
3,change or reformulation,"Did Tresor change or did I? certainly from 20 years ago I have changed. It was magic, magic, magic: soft wonderful apricot, rose, floral musky beauty. I worked overtime to afford it. A whole shift back in the day, 8 nasty hours on one's feet. It was worth it. Fast forward 15 years: I bought a large bottle and its just not the same. Boring, generic stuff. The bottle certainly looks authentic but perhaps the juice has been reformulated. I'll probably give it away, sigh."
2,"Incomplete, poorly written, disappointing","Look, if you're a Ramones fan, you may want to pick it up anyway, but really, all the best bits in here are covered in Legs McNeil's stellar PLEASE KILL ME; which covers the punk movement in its' entirety, and much more effectively than this whining, complaining, finger-pointing tome of malcontent. Dee Dee looks back on his time in the Ramones without a trace of the humor and insightfulness that made the Ramones so unique, and there are many unfortunate and confusing omissions, most strangely no mention (not one!) of his earlier marriage. Trust me: leave this one behind and pick up PLEASE KILL ME. (and no, I'm not the author of that book)(I'm not even related)"
3,New York Rocks!,"Dee Dee wrote a great book! for more on the downtown NY rock scene, get a copy of Jayne County's ""Man Enough To Be A Woman"" from Amazon, the real masterpiece on the down town NY scene"
3,"Love the Ramones, this book could have been better","I know that this book was written in a true Punk sense, but it still left me hanging. I wish Dee Dee could have dished the dirt a little more (especially about the lyrics to 53rd & 3rd) I wish it could have been longer and a little more detailed."
2,OK book,"I was dissapointed with this book. While it was interesting at times, I wanted a little more about the ramones and their history, all through their carreer with Dee Dee. I would also have liked to hear what dee dee had to say about theri albums and what not. Instead it mostly talks about his drug habit."
4,Looks = tone?,"This guitar is gorgeous. Drop dead gorgeous. The beautiful gold hardware really sets it off nicely.And it has the signature ovation ""sound.""I tried this out at the local guitar store, and the looks totally won me over, but the tone did not. Thin, tinny, and flat sounding isn't really my cup of tea, but I'd say this would be a fantastic live instrument, as the body is quite feedback-resistant..just don't bring it into the studio.To reiterate, this is a beautiful guitar, with outstanding live capabilities, but an unplugged tone rivaling that of a $100 small-bodied guitar."
3,Good guitar but...,"Guitar sounds good even without amplifier (although not my Martin). A big problem I had with the preamp uses a 9V battery per day. I have to disconnect the battery every time I stop playing, otherwise discharged every time."
1,awful guitar,"If I could give this guitar less than one star I would, but I am required to give it one star in order to post my comments. The guitar arrived very quickly as promised and my son was SO excited to get it. It made a terrible buzzing sound even after being tuned and adjusted with the allen wrench that came with it in the box. Do not waste your money on this cheap version. We had to return it and it was a huge disappointment for my son-since this was the only gift he wanted for the holidays."
3,Good,"Good, however when exposed to high temps like in summer, gets a strange and strong odor. I'll try also Vanilla scent."
1,Use the Internet,"A waste of money. A waste of bookshelf space. Outdated as soon as you look at it. Prices are so flexible- you can thank or curse eBay-that it's a waste. Books on Collectibles are out-dated if you're searching for a price for your gramma's antiques. If you're interested in BROWSING or taking a few minutes to relax, then these books are okay. The internet is the only way to ""know your collectibles"" I'm afraid in 2010."
2,Barbara Stanwyck,"Barbara Stanwyck deserves better than this. The author tells the reader no more than a newspaper article would. Ruby Stevens' traumatic childhood and her chorus-girl period are the best parts of the book, but the rest is dealt with so routinely that the author gives no hint of having even seen her movies. Stanwyck is underrated, considering her versatility and, in the early years, her subtlety. Now that more of her 1930s films are being seen, it is time for someone to set this book aside and write a fresh one."
3,The Biorgraphy of Barbara Stanwyck by Al DiOrio,"I enjoyed the book titled The Biography of Barbara Stanwyck by Al DiOrio. However, I agree that it was a cut a paste account of the life of Barbara Stanwyck. The book did not give too much more information about Barbara's personal life and career than I already knew from both the internet and from the book Starring Miss Barbara Stanwyck by Ella Smith. Since I am such a big fan of Barbara Stanwyck and am eager to find out more about her, I am eagerly waiting for the Barbara Stanwyck biography by Virginia Wilson which is supposed to be the definitive book about Barbara's life and career. Hopefully, Virginia Wilson's account of Barbara Stanwyck's will be released soon and all of her fans will finally know the real Barbara Stanwyck."
2,Large Pressure Drop,"The claim is an approximate 3gpm pressure. I put it on and it was a tremendous pressure drop, so much that I had to remove it. I guess I will just use it as an emergency backup to the filter I have been using. Wish they would have been clearer about the effect on pressure."
5,Simply Spectacular!,"I have been collecting opera DVDs since I was 16. I am particularly in love with the bel canto opera movement. I have quite many different versions of La Cenerentola and I have to admit that this DVD became the most important peace of my collection! Everything is SPECTACULAR!!!. Visually it is as good as high def, which I don't have. The singing and acting are as good as it gets. All the principals are in their prime and the acting is a model for future singers to learn from."
5,Cinderalla,"This is a GREAT La Cenerentola! Elina Garanca does a wonderful job of interpreting the role and of singing. Her voice is pure, clear, sweet, acrobatic and pitch-perfect. The production is just right, with minimal costumes/make-up and scenery. The ugly step-sisters (beautiful women who used facial expressions, costumes and body movement to make them appear unattractive) are hilarious, as is the step-father. Although he is a real buffoon, he is frightening when threatening Cinderella and pushing her around. Lawrence Brownlee does a charming job as the prince and can really sing coloratura. I didn't like this opera much the first time I watched it because I'm not much into buffo, but watched it a few times because I like Elina Garanca. It has become one of my favorites!"
1,"Read the ""Editorial Review"" with care","Buyer be advised: this series is ""designed to dispel anti-Christian myths of historiography"" where ""a fundamental principle emphasized by each speaker is the providence of God and His sovereign direction over every fact of history.""In other words, this is history from the Christian point of view. If that's what you are looking for, enjoy; if not, beware. By no means is this an attack on any historical perspective. It's merely a clarification of this series' content."
1,"Not history, but an example of neo-con neofundamentalist revisionist history","This isn't a history series at all, but rather the rantings and ravings of the fringe neo-con neofundamentalist reactionary Evangelical lunatic fringe, served up in pseudo-academic disguise. It has no value in terms of learning history, however it might be useful if you have a pedagogical need to demonstrate how objectivity and historic fact can be subjugated to political expediency. I use excerpts from this following lessons on Nazi Germany and political propaganda, racial scapegoating, and then follow up on this with a critical analysis of pseudo-news and the neo-con movement in the 21st century. Otherwise, don't waste your money or time."

5,Move Over Karate Kid,"This movie is great! It dipicts a great story, that many people can relate too...The acting is great. The action is superb. The fighting is AWESOME.It is a similar movie to Karate Kid, but updated for the times, and has a hotter girl in it compared to karate kid!Not convinced by my review yet? Then watch the movie, and you will like it...Thanks..."
4,Great movie,It's a great movie I will watch it over and over I just wish I could import this video to iTunes so I could put it on my iPhone but o well
4,Awesome Movie,"This movie is awesome. I was expecting it to be a knock off of other fighting movies with a plot that would bore me. I was delighted to find that not only was Never Back Down different from the other fighting movies the plot didn't completely evolve around a cheesey tournament where our hero and villian will meet for a final showdown. I don't wanna spoil the movie, but the ending is a shocker and I was pleased. Also the fighting scenes are great for a movie with a PG-13 rating. I was shocked that they allowed as much blood and violence as they did, and kept that rating. I dont add many movies to my ""recomend to friends"" list, but this one made it."
4,My opinion,Its a little violent but just what my son in law is into. If you liked Fight club you'll love this one!
4,Homage to the montage,"Get a blender, mix Karate Kid, Rocky 3&4, add a touch of Indiana Jones and Best of the Best, the sport of MMA, and this is what you'll get.This movie is exactly what it was intended to be, an updated guy movie cashing in on the UFC's popularity. Much of this film (lines, scenes, plot) is directly derived from the movies I mentioned above, almost like the director is paying tribute to the training montage. Sure it's formulaic & predictable & cliche', it's well done for what you should expect.I had to laugh when the student beats the teacher in a footrace at the beach, kinda like when Rocky beat Apollo in the Rocky 3 montage. That's one example of the many times you'll recognize the other movies' influence. It's fun just for that."
4,Surprisingly Good Movie..!,"I purchased this movie because a relative helped make it - I feared it would be 'just another grade B fight flick'. Instead, I enjoyed a fast-paced, crisply-edited movie. While the story is somewhat of a cliche, it is a very well done production - something that reminds us why this sort of story became popular enough to be a cliche in the first place! Think Rocky...! While obviously a violent movie, it doesn't wallow in unnecessary blood and gore."
4,OK,Reminds me of the old Karate kid movies from the 80's but with MMA. I would watch it again if nothing else was on
5,Great.,This movie is awesome and the price rocked. I loved the fact I was able to find it in Blu-Ray and how it got here fast. Thanks.
4,good movie,"I bought this for my teenage son for Christmas and it's right up his alley. Exciting, not girlie, and of course, there's fighting involved!"
2,Could Have Been Good,"No shot lasts longer than two seconds. The director (influenced alas by last year's trendy faux ""realism"" of Blair Witch and Saturday Night Live) jerk-cam seems to think lots of viewers will tolerate constant jitter, zoom, shaky camera, and rapid two-second-long shots. Well, honey (director boy), most great directors create realism via dialog, acting, creative pacing, and a steady, normal camera. Unless you're on meth, your kind of filmmaking can easily make viewers either sick to their stomach or just annoyed. People don't view the world this way, honey. Meth-cam is old news and the reason this wasn't a pretty good flick. Good acting for the most part, and an interesting story idea. Ruined by the stupid ice-cam jitter-shot. Some people talk really fast, to show that they can put sentences together quickly and, thus, must be smart. Think about it."
4,Never Back Down,"This was another purchase for my son. I didn't think I would like this movie, but it turned out to be a well made movie. I liked it. My son loves it; he's watched it a lot!"
4,Good MMA movie,"Never Back Down is a fun movie to watch. The plot is very generic, and is completely predictable, but still fun to watch. The fight scenes are constructed well and shows some good MMA action. The special features on the disc are enjoyable. This movie was reviewed once as the mix of Fight Club and Step Up, so if you liked either movie or both, this is a good choice."
3,Mediocre,There was nothing special about this DVD. It really is what it is. OK price could have gotten it in stores for a cheaper amount.
1,Garbage movie,"A disgrace to mixed martial arts. Basically what it does is take karate kid and fast and the furious, add in anything in pop culture that would be considered the in thing, add in horrible acting, and you have a movie designed to just make a quick buck. Movie is complete garbage. Avoid it at all costs."
1,worst movie ever,"this movie stinks. thank god i didnt buy it. its so unrealistic....too high school like with the drama issues. the guys just take off their shirts to show off their toned bods. and the ending...what was that? we fight and kick each others asses, breaking bones and stuff and we are ""cool"" with each other? plus after u beat the ____ out of someone, no cops come and no one files any sort of lawsuit? seriously? and only two friends visit u at the hospital? i guess thats why its just a movie, right?"
5,Koala bears go to a costume ball!,"The bears of Koala Park in Australia all become angry and stop speaking to each other. This bothers the wise old bear so he decides to throw a costume ball, where they can become friendly again not knowing who they are talking to. Beautifully illustrated by the author, this was a 1951 Caldecott Honor book."
5,At Last!,"Sometimes it seems like 12-step programs have taken over the world! Their adherents zealously insist that the 12 steps/AA is the ONLY way to cope with alcoholism. This book presents a welcome escape from the tyranny of 12 steppers. In a thoughtful, balanced way, the author reports that there really are other answers for alcoholics, answers that might suit some of them much better than abstainence programs do. She carefully examines all sides of the abstainence argument and details a variety of alternative programs. In addition to the very readable narrative, the book contains an extremely valuable appendix that describes more than a dozen different programs/organizations and gives contact information for each as well as a list of therapists who offer moderation training."
5,Great look at options other than AA,"I liked this book because it describes different options than the only one I knew about before I read the book -- Alcoholics Anonymous. As a person who is not particularly religious, the idea of giving up drinking completely AND beginning a new religion at the same time was never going to happen. Now I have some ideas to help me try to cut back, and see if that will work for me. If not, maybe I'll try one of the other groups mentioned in the book. Easy to read, too! Also liked all the web addresses for help and research."
1,Very Disappointed,"Let me start by saying my laptop is a Dell Inspiron 8200. I wish I would have read the previous reviews before purchasing this product, as I would have seen that it wouldn't have worked.I was very disappointed with many aspects of the product.(1) No mention of any incompatabilities whatsoever.(2) No software or drivers were included (except for Microsoft Streets & Trips, which is a completely separate product)(3) Minimal documentation, and NONE concerning the setup of the PCMCIA option.(4) Pharos website, www.pharosgps.com, has a terrible support area and no relevant downloads or information for my problem.Needless to say, this is going back in the morning, and definitely not recommended for Dell laptop users."
1,Adobe blows,"I wouldn't know how good this item is because Adobe made it nearly impossible to transfer the license over. No negative against the seller. He was very patient and accommodating, it's just Adobe put up so much red tape that we both gave up. I had an older version of Dreamweaver from Macromedia. I would've liked to have seen the new features from this but I guess Adobe doesn't care to help it's loyal customers."
5,Perfect Companion for Any Neuroscience Course,If you want hi-yield facts then this is the book for you. The book is clearly written. Useful for any graduate/undergraduate neuroanatomy text or for a medical school neuroscience course.
3,Same as BRS Neuroanatomy,"This book is nearly identical to the BRS Neuroanatomy. It is the same author and same publisher. You'll notice that chapters are nearly identical. The phrasing has been slightly modified in areas, but it has roughly 99% of the same content. The BRS has practice questions and answers at the end of each chapter, which the High-Yield does not. So, if you already have the BRS, don't waste your money buying this.Some of the illustrations have the footnote ""Reproduced with permission from BRS Neuroanatomy"", which I couldn't figure out because the author and publisher are the same, so why would they need permission from themselves to duplicate their work?"
3,Too obsolete,Essentially no revision from 2nd edition. Information is little out of date. Please make revision and really new edition for me.
5,A great overview book!!,"This book contains all the essentials for Neuro for STEP 1, get it and read it!! The introduction by Dr. Fix includes high points that can be used as a quick run through of the entire book or a last minute review of the whole text. Almost all in my medical class used this book for the Boards."
5,The best you can get.,"This really is a little gem. It is easy enough for a beginner. Don't get me wrong, you will still need to spend a good amount of time learning the material, but this book is probably one of the best ways to supplement class notes. It is very, very brief and is filled with all the stuff that you need to know. It also makes an excellent review for USMLE step 1 because it is so brief."
3,its not about a guy that gets caught selling dope.......,this book is really about a guy who get busted for weed and then trys to help is brother get off dope and away from a bad gan calle dthe coppers.
2,"Not UL listed,","This device is NOT UL listed, or at least it gives no indication of it. The housing box that the wires will be housed in is a folded metal construction, and the seams are not welded. So there is an air gap on four of the corners.I am quite disappointed in the construction of the box. The switch quality seems OK, but I'm not sure I even want to install it due to the housing/box.FYI, the one I received was gold colored, to answer a previous commenter."
2,Malfunction,"I bought 4 of these light buttons, only 3 out of 5 are working properly. One of the switches was defective and closet light only goes on randomly. I tried to contact the merchant to see if he would send a replacement but so far I have not heard from him."
2,Unreliable,"I installed this switch less than one year ago. Until recently it has worked well, but it has started to be unreliable over the past few weeks. Now the switch does not function at all and leaves the light on continuously. I would not recommend this product."
2,You get what you pay for,"Broderbund is very deceptive when they say you can save your files as PDF's for bulk printing at your local printshop. As someone who works for a print shop I can tell you we CRINGE when we get these files. All pdfs are not created equal and there are invaribly problems with anything created in this program that is not going to be placed on the glass and copied.You want home publishing, get MS Publisher. ..."
3,Good Enough,"I have enjoyed using this program. I haven't had any problems with it. There are plenty of graphics, with more ""free"" ones available online. The photo tools are nice and east to use. If you want a straight-forward print program to make signs, flyers, cards, envelopes, newsletters, etc., this is for you."
1,exasperating,"The standard version is just a teaser to get you to buy the upgrade to the ""Deluxe"" version. After getting the software installed, you then find that it can't even change the paper size. The on-line instructions aren't customized for each version so you'll spend a lot of time wondering why selections aren't available. Of course with the deluxe you get video editing, which if you don't need it is just software bundling at it's worst."
3,If I made a print package: this would not be it..,"I borrowed this from my sister in-law, and should have known something was wrong when she said, ""keep it"". It's time consuming and lead's to alot of frustration. If you only want basic, simple project's, this might work. I was dissapointed in it's overall capabilities."
5,love and leprosy,"Narrated by Robin Williams, this 60-minute film tells the story of the Flemish priest Damien de Veuster, better known as Father Damien, who followed God's call to serve the leper colony on the Hawaiian island of Molokai. Beginning in 1866 the government segregated lepers to the barren island of Molokai where they were abandoned to hostile, isolated and horribly primitive conditions, with no housing or even potable water. In 1873, at the age of 33, Father Damien arrived to serve the 600 dispossessed people. Passionate, driven, and the object of baseless criticisms from Protestants, Father Damien provided for the material needs of the people (housing, food, medical care) as well as their spiritual needs. He even built their coffins and dug their graves. Sixteen years later, in 1889 he died there of leprosy. In 1995 Pope John Paul declared Father Damien ""blessed"" (beatified), which is the second of three stages to canonization as a saint."
5,Check out SIMPLE COURAGE documentary,"If you want more, the other documentary available at Amazon is my other documentary SIMPLE COURAGE, which was a PBS doc that explored the leprosy epidemic in Hawaii in the late 1800s and Father Damien's courageous and compassionate intervention. Written by me, who also produced and directed it. It was an EMMY winner. This piece is not a bio about Damien but more of a social history that looks back in this age of AIDS to ask what have we learned in 100 years. These two disease have social parallels. Fascinating and important history."
3,AN`UNCOMMON KINDNESS;FATHER DAMIEN STORY,"IT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. I THOUGHT IT MAY BE SIMILAR TO THE MOVIE MADE ABOUT FATHER DAMIEN STARRING KEN HOWARD, WHICH I SAW SEVERAL YEARS AGO, HOWEVER, IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE."
5,Isabel Bishop,"This beautiful book is an excellent collection of the work of a little-known artist. It includes a detailed accounting of her life in art, as well as many full-page color illustrations of her paintings and numerous examples of her preparatory drawings and sketches."
2,Alternate,"3M Filtrete furnace filters fit perfectly, as they are slightly smaller than the stated 24x12x1. I get them at the local hardware store and they are labeled as a 3 month filter for allergens. If you are in the store, hold them up to similar labeled filters, and you will see that they are slightly smaller. $12."
3,Don't be fooled,Based on the product description I thought I was purchasing a Jet branded replacement filter. These are not made by Jet but are by another company which fit the AFS-1000B. I have yet to use one but the filter portion does not look as well made at the Jet branded filter. Time will tell how they perform.
5,Hands free,"This was not my first cell phone purse, but it was one of the best. I purchased an extra one for a friend of mine because she started having memory issue and couldn't keep track of her phone. She loved it and even went online and purchased a second one in a different color. She uses it constantly. I always kept mine attached to my purse for the most part and I also love it."
4,Bad shipping mentods,"The product (Lifesavers) arrived in a short amount of time, BUT the packing and shipping method was horrible. So far every roll that we have opened as been broken. Not one lifesaver is whole. Some are split in half and others and just crumbs. We were not satisfied with the shipping. Please correct for the future. Thanks. dsf"
5,"Excelent sackpack, works perfect as beach bag","I used as beach bag, and works absolutly perfect, fit my towel and all the extras that I ussually takes with me, recomended 100%"
3,Not as good as the TV episodes...,"The Keys of Marinus is one of the best First Doctor adventure. I love the details, the sense of a quest, the feeling of danger towards a whole planet. Too bad that does not come out in the novel form of the story. It lacks the feeling of detail, the complex characters, the whole feeling of a epic story has been tossed out the window."
4,good value,"The brackets are well built, cutting and putting the green house to gether was done in an afternoon approx 4 hours.Have had windy days and the green house is still solid.I would purchase these brackets again, for other projects."
2,It's plastic,Don't even think about this product if you have any kind of wind. The flimsy plastic will crack and the wood will break like tooth picks. Spend your money on metal brackets if you need a stronger structure. This is more of a temporary structure.
3,Shabby Treatment for a classic film.,"MGM Vintage Classics, known for their bare minimum approach to the release of the many fine films in their library (NO extras, not even a paper insert outlining chapters), strikes again. This time out, the print of the film is heinous, including a warped sound track. There is simply no excuse to mar an Oscar winning film in this manner. Better prints exist! I've seen one on Turner Classic movies. With just a little effort, it could have been presented so much better. The only logical explanation is a pact with one of their sister companies to make their offerings as bad as possible, wheting the desire for a Collector's Edition later on. There ought to be a law. 5 stars for the movie, 0 for this dvd edition."
4,Drama,"Burt Lancaster plays the role of an unscrupulus individual who will grab at anything just to make a buck, until reality jumps up and bites him. Faining something he really isn't, opens him up to an achievement that he no way deserves. These prsonality traits and the results are portrayed by a notably cast."
3,hollywood's cynical take on Christianity,"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYBurt Lancaster seemed to delight in portraying anyone to the right of his liberalism as degenerate fools. So he is right at home as fake preacher Elmer Gantry. The book of the same name was Sinclair Lewis' attempt to discredit evangelist Billy Sunday and any others who dared to preach the Gospel.Not satisfied with one character to promote the predominant worldview espoused in the arts, Hollywood brought in Jean Simmons to play an evangelist that is a thinly disguised portrayal of Aimee Semple McPherson, and Arthur Kennedy as a cynical, agnostic journalist. Shirley Jones won an Oscar for best supporting actress as a prostitute who got her start thanks to Gantry; Lancaster won an Oscar for best actor.53 years after Elmer Gantry's release Hollywood continues to demonize Christianity but not Bhuddism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism or any other religion."
1,Elmer Gantry,Video would not play. Error message. The person I gave the video too was very disappointed I would have sent it back but thew everything away. Never had this problem before.
4,Elmer Gantry,Powerful performances by Burt Lancaster and Jean Simmons. Thinly veiled tale of selling salvation for money which is as relevant today as it was back when the film was made.
2,"my Worst, for quite some time...","Apparently, I usually have better luck in choosing entertainment. I think Cecil B DeMile said: ""If you want to send a message, use a telegram"". This movie might appeal to religious fanatics, but that's about it. It's highly contrived, and the 'accidental' fire ending was a Poor Plot Escape..."
1,A movie about bible thumping,Elmer Gantry was a shifty movie that bounced around between religion and prostitution. The acting was great but the content was as exciting as watching paint dry. Over all Elmar Gantry is worthless hype.
2,"Not bad--but not great, either","I found this book to be interesting in that the author addresses numerous issues that most writers would not dare to address in terms of African American race intra-relations. Unfortunately, she does a poor job with analyses about her own self-perceptions and choices she made in terms of dating and close relationships. It's evident that she grappled with how she fit in the broad scheme of things (i.e., the BLSA at HLS, other African Americans in the Air Force, etc.), but the book offers little closure on these issues, really. I would recommend that the author take notes from ""White is a state of mind"", by Melba Patillo Beals. This author fully addressed her choice to marry a white man, internal struggles with regard to relationships in general and men in particular, and choices she made throughout her life as it related to her career, etc. I really enjoy memoirs overall, but Dickerson left me hanging."
1,did you really say that barack obama wasn't black enough?,how is it that you can write a book about racial unfairness and then make proclaimations about someone else's 'blackness'? how are you any less of a racist than those people who unfairly judged you?
4,interesting,I found this book to be very informative. Debra is an excellent writer who makes it easy for the reader to follow the verbal path that she lays down. As an African Amerian college student I found her story of courage and triumph to be both inspirational and motivational.
1,"Prolonged, tedious navel-gazing whine","Typical whining Harvard Law School brainwashed product, nothing to say and says it poorly. (I know, I graduated from HLS). Avoid"
5,must-read for book groups and individuals,"Dickerson has written a searing story of struggle and success. Her narrative voice is engrossing, appealing and emminently readable. Her journey from sharecropper's daughter to Harvard Law School graduate kept me marveling at her continued accomplishments. But she doesn't stop there...Dickerson also offers extraordinary perspective into her own behavior and the behavoir of those around her. At every turn she analyzes her motivations and separates out issues of race and personal identity. With sparkling insight, she digs right to the core of human behavior.Book groups and other readers will find themselves mulling over such topics as obstacles to maximizing personal potential and to what degree our race/religion/ethnic identity affects our life choices.By the time I finished this book, I felt as if I had just completed a soul-searching conversation with an old friend."
5,Terrific,"A wonderfully smart and moving read. Dickerson's writing is lively, touching and smart. Her story is remarkable (particularly on an underexplored fact of American race relations: the way that the military helps minorities advance), and told with pitch-perfect tone. Finally, a memoir from someone who's actually done something interesting--and brave--with her life."
2,Not bad,This is just a really small piece of something like a laminating sheet. When I put it on a hair got stuck and when I pulled the sheet up to remove the hair it left a line of air across the middle. I guess it's okay but I don't think it was worth $10. For future reference I'd just buy those self-laminating sheets for under $2.
5,Cool,"Resolve has an awsome chorus. I enjoy listening to it! I hope the rest of the singles for this album are from the second disk, that is the true point in this double disk set that should be recognized. The Foo's are great at doing what they do. What they do is put out kick ass hard rock/clever pop which has the power to bring together music lovers of all kinds. However, never before have the devoted an entire album to softer cuts. I believe that the record company managing the Foo's should stop choosing JUST the singles that ""will sell"", and pick some nice, mellow tunes represented on this album. I would recomend ""Cold Day In The Sun"" or ""Razor"".Anyway, Resolve is a cool tune that is lots of fun and a pleasure to listen to."
5,Very pleased,We bought this DVD player months ago and haven't had any problems! It was easy to set up and works well--we haven't been disappointed.
2,"Nice unit, but may completely die","I have had 2 A120 units for about 5 years. One started acting up a couple months ago, with display problems. Now it just says ""NO PLAY"". I opened up the unit and it is dust free; I don't think there's anything I can do. No info at Panasonic web site.So these units seem pretty good, until they're not."
1,Panasonic DVD players are so-so,"I originally bought a Panasonic AU-115 DVD player. It would occasionally freeze up on certain scenes while playing a movie.I exchanged it for a different one,same model.Same problem,with the addition of skipping while playing a CD.I returned it and got my money back.Later,I bought a Panasonic AU-120 DVD player.Guess what? Yup,same problem!I returned that one,too.I might try a different brand later.I'm concerned that this freezing problem may not be confined only to Panasonic DVD players.I've heard that it happens to all brands of DVD players,and if this is true, I'm going to stay with VHS until they fix the problem with this format.At least movies on VHS do not lock up,and they[in many cases]cost only about 25-50% of what movies on DVD cost.And you don't have to sit through the stupid anti copy warnings,either!!!That is soo irritating!!!"
1,in a class by its self,If there were a lower grade I'd give it to this product. I received this model for my birthday and had it up and running the only problem was there was no picture even though all the connectors were right on. As I see Panasonic has a poor reputation on their players and customer service so I will be returning this product inmediately.
2,Buyer Beware,"Panasonic is a respected brand with a high reliability rating. However, this particular model is sometimes in need of a firmware upgrade. The problem may not crop up at first, but soon you will notice problems arising with various discs. (Pixellation, picture freeze along the most common.)I've noticed it on two titles personally although some owners have reported more. Panasonic has a nasty habit of being in need of upgrades and it is a chore to get them done."
5,A good choice,"I have owned this DVD palyer for over a year now and have been nothing but pleased. It has great everything!! Never had ANY problems. My 2yr old son wedged a toy credit card into it, and after we removed it, It still was like NEW. I think it is a good choice if your looking for a great quality, durable DVD player."
1,worked fine... for one year,"Bought this about one year and one month ago, and I've played an average of about 3-4 discs a month. Worked fine until now. Now I'm getting severe pixellation on a lot of discs, and it can't even read other discs. After checking around on the web, I've found this to be a common problem, and that it's likely the optical pickup that failed. Since it's just out of warranty, and the part costs $..., I'm chucking it. Avoid Panasonic DVD players like the plague!"
2,"Nice player, but failure-prone","I purchased one of these about 6 months ago. I was initially very pleased with it, but it now tracks really poorly, leading to annoying pixelation, even on brand-new disks. I wouldn't recommend it given the failures mentioned in other reviews."
1,BAD CHIPS IN PANASONIC DVD players!,"It seems there is a trend here. I also loved my Panasonic player until it melted down - just like the others in these reviews.The repair guy says he can order a new board (as the chips aren't replaceable) for $150 - total repair price over $200.I bought it exactly 13 months ago - so much for a one year warranty. Panasonic won't admit to any problem with these chips and won't repair it under warranty.If this many machines are going bad with exactly the same symptons (pixelization, sound cutting in and out, then locking up), shoudn't Panasonic step up and recall them or at least honor the warranty one month over the date?I am buying a Sony and will never buy Panasonic again."
1,Panasonic Lets You Down With This Player,"The other comments about problems with this player are all true. Give this one a miss and buy another brand. I bought a Sony and are very happy after numerous problems with the Panasonic, including pixilation & lockups leading to total failure. Panasonic were totally unresponsive so I cut my loses!!!"
1,Junk,"I have had the same experience as many of the other reviewers on this forum, pixelation and freeze-up. I have had mine for less than one year and it has now failed for the third time. Panasonic is absolutely no help and will not recognize that they have a faulty product. I will never purchase any of their products based on the service I have received"
1,Don't Buy This or Any Other Panasonic DVD Players,"I had one of these and just like one of the other comments here, it was faulty and Panasonic were no help. There are apparently common problems with Panasonic DVD players that involve having to replace the laser assembley. This costs in labor alone, around $100 and the warranty with this player is only 90 days on labor and 1 year on parts. Take my advice and avoid this until Panasonic sorts out these quality problems. There are web sites dedicated to people that have experienced these problems, listing hundreds of named dissatisifed customers. Amazon should not sell this player!"
1,Makes a great doorstop.,"I was once Panasonic's biggest supporter, always the first to suggest their products to those in quest for quality electronics. However after purchasing this DVD model, I can no longer. After one year of faithful service (coincidence that it's the same date the warranty expired?) the optical pickup went south on me, and now the player will only play 1/3 of my discs (and even then not very well). I picked this model because of its high reviews, so it was all the more shocking to me when I saw other reviews here about the same problem, but if your considering purchasing a Panasonic DVD player, be forewarned."
5,great picture quality and features,"I have bought this player and are completely satisfied by the image quality and sound it produces. For what it worth, it has more features (like virtual surrond sound) than most other players for the same amount of money."
4,It's a good player for the price.,"Hi I recently purchased the A120U Panasonic DVD Player. This is my second player for my bedroom, it's a good little unit with its little surprises like playing VideoCD (i have a few imports from HK) and it was that feature for the price that drew me in. I'm happy with it except as mentioned before it does seem to have some problems playing a couple of discs (Lodoss War & SFII). My only recomendation is if you're a movie fanatic (i.e.; you own a laserdisc, dvd, SVHS, dolby decoder etc like me! :)) stay away and opt for a more expensive model if this is your first player I dont see why you shouldn't pick up the A120. Dont forget to get some DVD movies as well! Amazon has a GREAT selection for newbies!"
4,good machine...,"This machine has impressed me. It has a large number of features thatmany other machines of its price range don't have. I have also runmovies in excess of 3 hours long and have had no problems. partly, I have only had the machine for a month but the machine has been in use for about 2-3 hours a night. I am pleased with this machine and I highly recommend it to anyone...."
2,NO PLAY Problems & Frustrating Solution (Won't Always Work),"After about 2 years of use, my Panasonic DVD A-120 also started displaying ""NO PLAY"" on its front window, along with the message, ""This Type of Disk Cannot Be Played. Please Insert A Different Disk"" on my television. It started out only effecting a few rental movies, but now effects a majority of disks. I am going to buy a newer JVC or Panasonic DVD player to replace it.I have found many DVDs will play if I open and close the DVD tray several times. When this works, the DVDs play without any problems with all DVD functions available. For some disks, it takes an intolerable number of open and close cycles to get lucky. For others, it never works."
1,Defect-ridden,"For shame Panasonic. It's quite obvious that there are serious flaws ridden in this DVD model. Just as with so many customers, my A120 went sour after barely a year. It refuses to play discs, even brand new ones, with the message ""No Play"". The ones that actually do play often have pixelation issues. Avoid."
1,Stopped working after 7 months!,"I thought I was buying a nice DVD player, one that wasn'tcheap, but not expensive. I bought it in September, and here it isjust April and it has stopped working! I kept it in an entertainment center with a glass door covering it, so I know it is nothing I did. When I put a DVD in, it says ""NO DISC"". It won't read the disc. Please, if you get this player, get an extended warranty, at the very least."
1,This skipping and freezing bug plagues my favorite DVD's!!!!,"My most recent purchases ""The Matrix"" and ""Heat"" have had nothing but skipping and freezing. The picture skips around while the audio fads out. Acts kind of like a VHS tape that has been twisted (the film inside the tape) until it eventually freezes. I like Panasonic products but I wouldn't buy another one of their DVD players for this reason. I bought one other for a Christmas present (at the same time I purchased mine) and it has the same issues. My roomate has a Sony which I asked him to play both of these movies and he didn't experience any problems with both movies."
3,Be a little wary of Panasonic DVD players,"I received a Panasonic 105U model for Christmas last year. The picture is quite good and the audio fine. The unit began freezing and skipping till it would eventually only play about 20 minutes of a film before locking. It took Panasonic about two months of phone calls before they finally repaired this for me. (I received e-mails from other people from a review site who had the same trouble). It works now (since July) with one exception. It does not play certain DVDs, such as Criterion's ""High and Low."" It's not about bad discs. Something about how the disc is being mastered being incompatible with the decoder Panasonic uses on some models. I read another review recently where someone else specifically mentioned this disc. Criterion told him it would not play on that model. Again, I'm happy with the picture. When it works, it's very good. But it caused me a lot of trouble."
5,Great Player,"I've had my 120 for about 2 months and have watched about 30 DVDs(sometimes 2 or 3 in a row). I have had no problems or glitches at all. The picture and sound are excellent. After a lot of reading it seems to me that many dvd players from all different companies have their problems. I don't think you can say all Panasonic or all Sony DVD players suck based on a few defective players. Most people have horror stories about at least one of the major brand names. I always get an extended warranty anyway just to be safe. By the way, I've checked a lot of other sites and this seems to be the only forum with any negative things to say about the Panasonic 120. Anyway, I love my 120 and recommend it without reservation."
2,"Plays DVDs well, otherwise unremarkable","I purchased this new in 1999 for $420.Pros:- Rarely had a problem playing retail DVDs- Never had any problems with optics or electronics -- still works fine 8 years later.Cons:- Awkward form factor. Fairly large (tall) and yet fairly shallow. It's too tall to sit on top of a TV, yet too shallow and light to stack another components on.- Does not play CD-R discs.- Does not play CD-RW discs reliably (lots of skips)- Problems playing DTS DVD-A discs. Not sure why, but I get no audio on some DVD-A's when using DTS mode.Don't know why anybody in 2007 would ever have reason to purchase this. It's a fairly mediocre DVD player."
1,Stops Working After One Year,"This DVD player worked great for one year. The problem started slowly -- it refused to read the dvds, but after opening and closing the tray a few times, it would read them. Now, it never recognizes a dvd, even after opening and closing the tray many times. Seems like this is a common fault according to the other reviews. Since it no longer works, after only a year, I cannot recommend that anyone buy this product."
2,The panasonic pick switch,"Ok, let's be serious here. Any player you buy is going to havean amazing picture. Likewise, the sound on any machine will make VHSseem pathetic. So what you want is ease of control, and reliablity. This is an OK machine, but after trying both, I settled on the Panasonic DVD-A320 over this on for a few reasons. First, the 6 channel discrete output for Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS that you can't get on this model. Unless your tuner has a decoder, this feature is worth the extra coin. On the 320, you can adjust the dB level of every individual speaker output. <NICE> The remote is very intuitive making control an breeze compared to the confusing Hitachi and RCA button butchers. I've experienced absolutly no pixilation or skipping as others have on this model. My only complaint is that they couldn't be bothered to throw in a lousy s-video cable with the package like they used to. A small loss on a great machine. Pay the extra and buy the A320 model."
1,Not Made to Last :-(,"I owned a Panasonic A110 for 16 months. For that time, the unit functioned flawlessly and I was very happy with it.Then the OPU (Optical Pickup Unit) failed like everyone elses (cost to repair: $225!). This is a well documented problem with the A110, A115, A120 and A310 series. Most newer players have a corrected OPU, but watch out.I have since purchased a Sony S550D which I have been very pleased with!"
2,Optical pickups die on these units,"Watch out, buyers. Panasonic's A-series of DVD players will work great for a year or so, then the optical pick-up will stop working. Then you can't watch any more DVDs without spending $150-200 in repairs. It is a flaw that sent my unit into the shop, just outside of the warranty period. If you are going to buy this unit, be sure to buy an extended warranty with it. Boo Panasonic."
1,Is a waste!,"I like it in the beginning, it function correctly it so happen my phone line tag or pull by my kids it break so easy than a regular phone line jack I have 5 of this in stock. I hope this last jack it won't break. I should have buy the best that last. Is good but be very careful using it breaks easily have to buy some more an is a waste of money."
4,2nd in Series and 2nd Best,"I absolutely loved David Skibbins debut novel of the Tarot Card Mysteries, ""Eight of Swords"". I could not put it down. The characters were extremely different and quite multi-faceted, the mystery well-plotted, and rapidly paced. ""High Priestess"" was good, but it lacked the vitality of the first book. The historical references were somewhat overwhelming and at times dragged down the book's action. The characters were not as well-drawn as they had been in ""Eight of Swords"" and Sally, the returning love interest played far too nominal a role in this story. The tarot card reading at the beginning of the book was nicely done, as were the descriptions of the tarot cards, and the Berkeley area. I definitely want to read ""The Star"" but hope to see more character development and a bit less political history."
2,Nah....,"If you saw Ong Bak or the Protector, don't be assuming your going to see that stuff here. I still haven't been able to watch more than 20 min because even if you listen to the Thai audio track, the mouths are out of sync."
1,WTF???????,"Im a big fan of Tony Jaa, he's almost up there with jackie Chan(not just yet). But this is my second time falling for the photo shop, up to date promo cover. The first time it happened with ""Spirited Killer"", and Tony was barely in that as well, this movie...... I'm use to horrible Dubbing, but this movie, I was done with the movie, when the big Australian dude came into the picture and when he started talking, they gave him a voice of what sounded like a(n) old asian man that spoke broken english. I couldnt stomach watching the rest, I was seriously disappointed."
1,Even kids are used to better,Oh gosh this is terrible. Poor quality all around and nothing but running around and shooting and fighting. Hardly a script. Inexcusable photography. Why are there special features? I must admit that I was so turned off that I did not look at them. I was in no mood even to be amused.I liked a lot of things about The Protector and decided to give this a try. But any similarity was unrecognizable.Not a keeper!
1,It's so bad it's funny...,"Oh, this film is terrible and is nothing like the quality of ""Ong Bak"". A minimal plot about the rescue of a archiologist/treasure hunter from a large group of drug-smugglers, pitiful dialog, simple photography, and weak action scenes make this film worthy of the trashcan. Much of the climactic battle at the end is done with gunfire and small explosions (with the exception of the guard towers - they explode into fireballs) instead of Thai martial arts. I did have a chuckle at the cringe-worthy conversations between the characters but otherwise this is not worth wasting either time or money on."
3,Der Unttertan in archaic typeface,"It's a great book from a great writer, but the reproduction of the 1914 edition is-- of course-- printed in the ""old-time"" typeface used commonly before the end of WWII. I never saw it much when I lived in West Berlin and only encounteed it here when looking through family heirlooms.The archaic typeface has slowed down my reading of the book and might be a problem for other Deutsch-als-Fremdsprache readers as well."
3,"OK, but not great, and kind of expensive for what it is.","Didn't fit perfectly, Screen cover thing is cheesy. So ""grippy"" that it is hard to get ipod in or out of my pockets. Don't use this anymore. Plus it is kind of expensive for what it is. Ended up just using a ""naked"" IPOD. works better that way."
2,Buyer Beware!,"This case is for the 5G 60GB Ipod. It is way too large for the 30GB. This case will offer scratch protection and that is about it.If you want a really nice, high quality case for your $300 investment go to www.vajacases.com. These custom made leather cases not only look REALLY GOOD but they offer protection from scratches and falls (in case you drop your IPod). They are made-to-order and take appox. 45 days to received once ordered. The cost...$70 well spent dollars!"
1,Amen to the anonymous customer's review!,"I got the book as a used book, minus the CD-ROM, and for only $20, on Amazon Marketplace. The skimpy 70-page book isn't really even worth $20. I've seen much better books around for reasonable prices, and I rather wonder why the publisher expects anyone to pay nearly $100 for the book. As the anonymous customer who reviewed it earlier said, perhaps if you really want the CD it might be worth putting out the money, but as a reference on musical temperaments, even $20 is too much."
2,"Read ""Too Big To Fail"" Instead","I get that other folks enjoy that this movie gets the details right, but it's a poor ripoff of far more interesting history.If you've read Too Big To Fail, you'll find this movie unbelievably dull and slow.If you absolutely must have a financial crisis movie fix, go with Margin Call instead."
2,Wall Street Money never sleeps,This film was good but nowhere as good as the original. Just did not hold interest like the original. Disappointed to see Charlie Sheen in his cameo role.
3,Almost a Success,Sequels generally have a hard time being as good as the original movie and this falls into that category. The story is good not great; the acting of Michael Douglas is also good but it is not one of his best; and the other characters did not offer enough charisma to carry their part of the story with the exception of Frank Langella who is killed off far too early in the movie and whose superb acting is prevented from making the story more entertaining.
4,Pretty good,"Not as good as the original Wall Street, but it was a pretty good follow up,I liked the way it tied the plot into the 2008 financial collaspe and Gekko's still a great character."
2,Not so great,it was a big disappointment. the background story was too simplistic and déja vu.The movie is too predictable. I wouldn't pay to watch this ...
4,Interesting take on the current financial crisis,"Nice job with the remake of a classic, just in time for the current financial crisis. And actually a likable performance from Shia. He's not usually my favorite, but he fits this role well."
1,Socialisim is the solution to our insanity?,"A movie claiming that freedom (or free market) allows us to do the same things over and over consequently claiming freedom is insane. Also claimed in the movie is that the option is Socialism. There by claiming Socialism is the solution to our insanity. Its very frightening when you think about how many people buy in to this ""slavery to save us"" mentality.Patriots, they will not need to take our guns. We will give them up willingly. The threat is real."
4,GREAT,"This is was purchased for our personal finance classes, students enjoyed. Recommend for business classes or social studies. We find it to be very educational"
1,Wall St Never Sleeps,"Poor DVD, will never purchase one again. The film was OK but dark at times. The disk itself was crap."
2,M. Douglas plays himself again,"This is an ok Oliver Stone flick really much more enjoyed ""Natural Born Killers: Director's Cut"" more action more blood, but i understand that this is not an action movie it's more like a drama/suspense. But once again M. Douglas plays him self all the time: All about money & power can't say if i can take him seriously as an actor, my mom don't like him at all. etc. it's ok not great or so wonderful or whatever they say."
4,A Decent Sequel,"This is a pretty decent sequel of the original. I would give the original 5 stars, but I only gave the sequel 4 stars."
1,Save Your Money !,"This movie is nothing like the original Wall Street. The plot was awful and the movie was a total waste of time. If I could have given it 0 stars I would have. I don't recommed anyone buy this movie, it is definitely not worth your time to watch it ! Like the title of my review, save your money, don't waste it on this movie. It is simply terrible,"
4,Wall Street for the modern day,"Wall Street was a film that captured the late 1980s world of finance. It exposed how the rich were getting richer and how they are doing all they could to prevent from getting caught. Years later Oliver Stone, who has kinda been struggling in making a good movie went back to his roots and gave us 'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps'This follow-up is not as great as the first one, but as a person who has a career in finace and knew about what was going on in the economy from 2008 until now it was a great thing to see it all incorporated into this film. The cast is what saves this movie. Michael Douglas gives a great performance returning as Gordon Gecko. Shia LeBouf is great, Josh Brolin is deliciously evil and Carey Mulligan is amazing. I am still waiting to see people finally realize just how great she is.If you are a fan of the first one chances are you will accept this sequal for what it is. Not as great as the first one, but it still follows the origonal quite well."
2,Snoozer,"The original film was riveting and thought provoking, however the sequel was predictable and riddled with half baked story lines. Disappointing...This film felt rushed to me."
2,A soapbox dud,"Given the fact that the original movie Wall Street is one of my favorites, I was excited when I first heard there was going to be a sequel. Imagine my shock at watching this dud.This film is lacking in just about every area imaginable. The story and performances certainly are forgettable (except Michael Douglas), and to me, it's a crime to relegate Michael Douglas to little more than a supporting role, while trying to cash in on his name.Oliver Stone loves to stand on a soap box and point fingers in judgment of others, and there's no shortage of that here.We all know that greed got us into the current financial mess we're in, tell us something we don't know.I've seen better made documentaries on the subject.I really wanted to like this film, but couldn't. I gave it an extra star for being able to see Michael Douglas, a master at his craft, perform so well despite the material he had to work with."
3,imagination + bull (market),"Michael Douglas and KerryMulligan take Lebief to school on acting. Whats so crappy is what is left out: The Freddie-Mac Fannie-Mae meltdowns which were denied up until 2008, in order to allow a panic stricken people to elect a pro-maoist/pro-islamic enemy as President. Funny how the Democratic head of Ways and Means gets a pass in this film. Barney Frank, the man-in-charge of Fannie and Freddie, ignored Bush's concerns, and said in June 2008 Freddie and Fannie are fine, when he knew there were trillions in mortgage money that wud stink to high heaven.Gee whiz, funny how left-wing Hollywood left that out."
3,A little unfocused,"Gordon Gecko has been released from prison and gets back into the game, while the strained relationship with his daughter is also an issue. The daughter is involved with a young man who is developing a future with her, but Gordon Gecko's presence presents problems for them. If it sounds like there is a lot going on here, there is, and that is the problem. The film doesn't know if it wants to be a story of family relationships, about the corruption that caused the financial crisis, or a film about deal making and dishonesty. Strong performances from an excellent cast help, but the storyline is a bit unfocused. A cameo by Charlie Sheen is a highlight."
3,worth a watch,"it was okay. usual average role for Douglas. he pulls it off. i think Shia would of been the better actor here though. he def to me out-shined Douglas. His role is a big step up from 'crystal skull' w/ Ford. What i don't understand is why they casted Shia's character to ride a motorcycle in the movie.. he is spose to be some hot shot wall street man and here he is on a cycle.. i would of thought they'd at least cast his character into a nice car.it was an okay movie. a little slow moving cuz i fell asleep towards the end, but i went back to finish it up. ""Solitary Man"" w/ Douglas was better."
4,Enjoyable!!!,Nice to see a sequel to Wall Street. Great cast! New York never looked so good. Worth the price of a rental!
1,This is some damn lazy filmaking. do not waste your time,So much more could have been done with this as Gekko was such a great character. the fairy-tale ending is not what I expect from Oliver Stone.
4,Worthy successor to Wall Street,"This long awaited sequel to the Gordon Gekko saga proves that Michael Douglass still has it. Check out ""Solitary Man"" for more proof. Gekko is released from prison after an 8 year stint and tries to put his life together. The only thing important, other than money of course, is his now grown daughter Winnie played by Carrie Mulligan. She wants nothing to do with him because of his crimes and the fact that her brother/and mother? (I forget) committed suicide. She blames her dad for that. There's a lot of financial mumbo jumbo going on here which will likely turn off some, but I found interesting. All of the actors hold their own in this worthy successor to a classic."
1,Sequel Schmequel,"This sequel is a huge letdown considering the brilliant original and the fertile connections with recent economic history it could mine. Shia Labeouf is unconvincing as a wall street up-and-comer, he seems more like a high school senior. The talents of Carrie Mulligan are wasted on a one dimensional character and Michael Douglas is the only actor earning his/her keep reprising his Oscar winning Gordon Gekko role.Avoid this clunker at all costs!"
2,sleep inducing,"the original, prescient wall street was razor sharp, and it's unfortunate this limp, crippled sequel was forced into production when the true gekkos, the reaganonomicists who were unleashed by bush & son (and yes, even abetted by clinton, who had, and passed up a chance to nix derivatives) to rig the markets to and beyond the point of strangulation, finallly closed in for the kill...making it so TOPICAL...but such would seem to be the case...the ending is one of the most unconvincing i have ever seen...the rest is no better than ordinary...the topic is as historical as they come, but the flik wanders vaguely between gekko's family troubles and, oh yes, the collapse of the world economy...oliver stone hasn't made anthing watchable, documentaries aside (i do not know them) since the delightful u turn 15 YEARS ago, reaching a possible all time nadir with the insipid W. don't go there, people...it has a little meat on the bone, but the rest is nothing but scraps."
1,Nothing like the first,The movie seems to have built around what Hollywood thinks happened with the financial crisis and the movie Wall Street is in the middle of it. This did not feel like a sequel and at times Geco seemed like a weak character. The film lost the edge it had in the first one. Watching it for less than $4 is probably ideal. For those hard core fans that saw the first one...you are warned!
1,Nothing like the 1st one,Bought for my husband for Christmas. He couldn't wait to watch it. Boy was he disappointed. He is a huge Michael Douglas fan and loved the first movie. This one was awful. He wishes he could return it and get our money back.
1,"Sadly inconsequential, not coherent, great production values.","What a disappointment. Great cast and production--the acting is good, but the movie just misses its marks. I don't feel the screenwriters/producers really had a handle on what they wanted to say. Although I am educated, working in the legal field, and have some understanding of how/why the economic sector has taken such a beating, I didn't get a coherent sense of what was going on with this movie, which seemed to pull its punches all the way through. Shila LeBoeuf, good actor, not well cast here. James Brolin, pretty forgettable, although a good actor normally. Carey Mulligan did a great job in a part that could have been played by any number of actresses. Michael Douglas is perfect in this role. The whole movie coulda, shoulda been better. Too bad."
3,Watchable entertainment but does not measure up to the original,"This second installment of the ""Wall Street"" saga does not do badly, and certainly is good entertainment. Those of us who enjoyed ""Wall Street"" will likely enjoy this one as well. That having been said, this one lacks some of the zip of the original. Mainly, that is because this one really does not have too much to say. The original ""Wall Street"" constituted essentially an allegory of the excesses of the 1980s stock market boom, insider trading scandals, and the like. This one reminds us that such things still go on today, but it delivers its message with less punch and no real panache.Having said that, this one is worth watching. Michael Douglas, as always, dominates, but the supporting cast is not bad, and all of this adds up to excellent movie entertainment. RJB."
2,Wall Street,This was not as good as the first. I am glad that I didn't pay full price at the theater.
2,Terrible is being kind!,"When I take a look at the actors, the potential for the movie and what they did with it I can only say...shame on you. You had the chance to take what happened on wall street for real and use it to make an incredible plot and movie. Instead it was ""a waste of time"". I have never given a 2 star rating before. This hopefully is my last. I won't go into details. I will let you draw your own opinions."
5,"Money, morals, story","I loved it. I am so glad and would reccomend that you watch the first wall street flick to really get the zing of Michael Douglas's character. Fantastic story, great acting and in the end a moral flick even if it takes the long way to get there."
2,Unbelievable Characters Make For Movie Gone Bad,Shia LaBeouf's character is too unbelievable to be able to sit through this and Emma Stone has too expressions: happy and sad. Michael Douglas' characters narcissistic personality disorder throughout the movie makes the ending unrealisic. I was very dissapointed and suggest you watch something else.
2,Too Contrived,"The original Wall Street had a suspenseful script & was loaded with great acting. The sequel also has great acting, but the story is too contrived. For instance, encountering the stooley Bud Foxx had no purpose other than to remind us of the original movie. In another instance Gordon Gekko just happened to write a book in prison predicting the current economic chaos. I will not provide other details as I do not wish to give the plot away. I have watched the original several times over the years but doubt I watch this one again."
2,"Good idea, very poor execution","The original Wall Street was a great movie, and I'm a finance junkie, so despite the mediocore reviews, I thought I might still enjoy this one. Despite my low expectations, I was seriously disappointed. The two biggest problems were the robotic, emotionally devoid acting and uninspired script. Douglas, LaBeouf and Mulligan gave subpar performances. They either looked like they weren't trying at all, or like they were trying too hard. LaBeouf, especially, looked totally lost playing his relatively simple character. He looked like a little kid who was trying to play a wall street trader. At the same time, the script did not give them much to work with, with cliched dialogue and complete predictability. This movie was boring and ultimately not worth the two hours of my life."
2,disappointed,"Mr. Stone is growing more and more political in his films which I suppose expressing your views throughart is why some direct or write, but this is a sequel to a great film and while the cast is supreme, andeven most of the story is useable, especially the first hour with frank langora and gekko exiting jail/book speechtheres good substance, but the second half is like Stone had no idea where to go with the movie. Maybe idont get it and we are all supposed to be entertained by the oh fatherhood and love is what ultimately savesthe soul and investing in our children blah blah... i don't know. Either way, it could have been better."
4,Wall Street Delivers,"I think Wall Street 2 delivers. This movie was well acted. Michael Douglas was terrific. I think that the story focused on Shia & Carey too much. I would have preferred more excitement in the stock market which Wall Street 1 depicted. After all, greed is good.On another note, I pray that Michael Douglas recovers. He is a fine actor."
1,Pointless,"Like many other reviewers, I loved the original movie. However, this movie is about as unwatchable as anything I've seen in a long time. I've been a finance professional for the past 22 years and I could hardly follow the disjointed logic of the underlying money issues. Add to that the pointless relationships between most of the characters and this turns out to be a movie I couldn't wait to see end. Too bad, too. Gordon is an iconic character who deserved much better following his time in prison."
2,A powerful dud,"There was a long list I read once of great movies which resulted in terrible sequels. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps falls into that category. It's not the morality story of the first one and gives us stiff and wooden actors. The old timers like Susan Sarandon, Frank Langella and Eli Wallach are great as always. Michael Douglas seems to just be floating through the movie and Shia Labouf is once again proving why he will be a movie of the week actor by the time he is 30.If you don't have to pay for this movie then don't!"
1,Very bad sequel,"Caters to people who want to blame everything on the banks. Movie for the masses.You are way better off watching the inside job. Also it is clear that they don't know a single thing how Wall street banks work, what they do and how they operate.Totally opportunistic movie to ride the way of the the financial crisis. Shame.... the first one was simply amazing!!!"
5,Mr. Douglas,Glad to see him in action again as Gecko. Fits the type casting to a t. Great to see he survived the throat cancer. What would life be without the Douglas' still acting.
2,Bad Script very predictable,I saw this move a few months ago and on reflection it was probably design as a piece of money making properganda.In this tale the good Jewish Banker is the victim of a scheming psycho goy !But the Jew makes good and they all live happily ever after.Douglas mast have been offered a percentage to go alone with this. Very disappointing and it had the potential to be a great movie alas art and Hollywood is not synonymous.
1,most boring movie on the planet,"The ads for this made the movie seem like it would be great. It has great actors like Michael Douglas and Shia Labeouf, but it was THE MOST boring movie I've ever endured watching. While in the theater, I contemplated leaving at least 10 times, but I kept waiting for the movie to get good. I was hoping it just had a boring first half, or an amazing ending. No, nothing like that, just extreme boredom, for both me and my friend. I can't believe I spent $12 on this movie, such a waste!"
2,Dull Series of Interviews With No Particular Focus,"This documentary basically consists of dozens of brief interviews with people from the San Francisco Bay area who have posted on Craigslist. The ads include a ""diabetic cat support group"" and ""seeking models who wear glasses"". Of course, there are alot of eccentric characters here. But the low quality of film making makes this doc more mundane and tedious then interesting.Part of the problem is that the film seems to have no purpose. The interviews are not especially funny, dramatic, inspiring or even informative. Also the segments are so short that you don't really develop an attachment to the people being interviewed. The camera work is shoddy and the whole project comes across as neither artistically credible or entertaining."
4,Informative and Interesting,"I bought the documentary to show in my college course about Human Communication on the Internet. The interesting scenes immediately give a sense of what Craig's List is and how it operates. I was surprised that there was no documentary-style information like I expect from a news report. The film simply shows people and what they say about their experiences as they use Craig's list. Some of the scenes are quite entertaining, and the piece is thought-provoking regarding our consumerism.My students seemed fascinated by the type of people who use the Internet this way. We have much to learn about how people use the Internet. I would think anyone interested in understanding the Internet or who is considering developing an Internet business could gain ideas from this documentary."
1,Absolutely worst and most boring documentary I've ever seen...,"Holy geez! I love craigslist and I had such big expectations for this movie. Very disappointing. Too bad they don't have a ""0"" rating. :(It was poorly produced and is recorded on what seems to the most crappy pixelated camera ever.Please do yourself a huge favor and don't go through the trouble of watching this horrible film. And especially don't purchase it!!"
3,Random B-day Gift,It's a pretty interesting look at the inner workings CL before the negative press. I bought this for a b-day present for a friend who is actually in the movie...weird seeing him but still cool I suppose...I didn't pay the $20 + dollars they're no charging for it though.
2,:S,"An interesting idea for a documentary: What happens in 24-hours on Craigslist? Or at least this is the repeated message on the box, previews, etc. Unfortunately, it's not so much about 24-hours on Craigslist (which could have been kind of awesome) as much as what happens on Craigslist and who the hell Craig is (or isn't). I enjoyed the film enough I finished watching it and couldn't resist the temptation of visiting my local branch of Craigslist. Beyond that though - eh, a bit of a waste of time."
3,"Good, kind of fun,","It was kind of fun to watch. Not awe inspiring. I bought it mostly because I like the website. But if you like people documentaries, you will like this. If you are a techie looking for more information about craigslist, this movie doesn't have it. It's about the people who use craigslist and not craiglist itself."
4,Very Good Album,"Buy this album, it is well worth the money. The songs are catchy, fun, whitty, and upbeat. Its kinda punk, but I really wouldn't describe it as a punk album, especially with a large number of solo tracks. For 20-some odd tracks at [the price] this album is a steal. I have been humming ""Since you been gone"" in my head all afternoon. ""Unpack your Adjectives,""""How'd the date end?"" and ""Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah"" are also among some of the other great tracks on this album. I don't know much about Mr. T experience, but I know this is a great CD!"
1,Experienced Print Shop user,"I bought the print shop deluxe version 15 because I had been very pleased with its previous editions. Well not with this one. It installed only part of the program, I uninstalled the whole program and started installation again, but the program insists it is already installed. So here I sit with a new program that is useless. Have contacted Broderbund but have not had a reply. Have had the computer checked out and it is the program not the computer causing the problem."
2,not up to standard,"I upgraded from Printshop 12 to Printshop 15 and am very disappointed. It brought my projects up but I can't access them. The ""Create Stationery"" creates stationery but, even tho' you insert a text box, you can't print in text. And, finally, when you create a greeting card you don't get instructions on when or how to re-insert the card to get it printed on both sides ... it automatically starts printing before you have a chance to re-insert. I've been corresponding with Broderbund tech help but nothing helps. Great graphics, tho."
2,"Access is ""iffy""","I've owned previous versions of this product, and I enjoyed using them. I found switching CDs a little annoying though, and welcomed the idea of one disk, with most of the art stored online, without taking up space on my computer.The art is wonderful; my real complaint with the program is the website access. All too often, I find myself in the middle of designing something when suddenly an object cannot download. There appears a blurb from the manufacturer telling you to try again later. Sometimes ""later"" is just a few moments later, other times it can be quite a while. Also, I find that the thumbnails are a little slow appearing, making scrolling through the art time consuming. I would give this product a much higher rating if it wasn't for this unreliability. I like the PrintShop, but I just bought Version 20 Deluxe, to be installed when I install my larger hard drive. I haven't installed it yet; I'm reading reviews here to see if anything else sounds more promising."
5,gift,"It is a Great movie, ordered it for a Christmas gift and it was loved. It arrived on time with no flaws."
3,A good beginning dictionary,"This is a very good beginner's dictionary (stress on ""beginner""). I think that if a student were to learn most of the words in this dictionary, then he could confidently count himself as possessing a ""functional"" Japanese vocabulary. By ""functional"" I mean the ability to do most daily tasks at their most rudimentary level (i.e. ordering food, asking directions, etc). I recommend those currently at the beginning or beginning-intermediate level to use this dictionary as a supplement to whatever instruction you are receiving (or for self-study)."
3,...,"its nice but it does not tell you how to SPEAK japanese.so i think its fine,ok,not what i was hoping for."
3,Useful but not enough entries listed,"Useful Japanese to English dictionary, with lots of examples and grammar stuffs. Though not very good for further referencing as its collection of words are just tiny."
4,"I tell my friends ""it's like Chicken Soup for the Wallet""",It's small and handy and I refer to it all the time. I even took down some notes in the margin.
1,"recorded in PAL, not NTSC; music is background to narrative","Bought through Amazon, listed as region 1 - what I received was ""suitable for all regions"" according to the DVD jacket. But when I put it in my Toshiba DVD player the message was ""Not NTSC -error"" and it would not play. Beware!!! DVD players for the U.S. recognize NTSC; PAL is for European players.Subsequently I played this on an all-region DVD player from Pioneer, and it will play the PAL. But ....... the name of the DVD is misleading. This is a travelogue with continuous narrative, music mostly very much in the background. Small snippets of many locations in Ireland, filmed almost entirely on sunny days(now THAT also is misleading!!!). So, if you want a narrated travelogue and have a DVD that will play PAL(U.S. is NTSC), then go for it. But if you want primarily music then this might not be your choice."
4,Better than the first movie,"I own both of these movies and I would have to say that the Return of Count Yorga is much better than the first movie. There are more vampires, a bit more eerie and some pretty good action. For a cheap movie like this one is...it's not all that boring.The only thing that I really hate about this movie compared to movies nowadays is that vampires died pretty easily to humans in the past..especially the 70's where there were vampire movies galore...and this is one of them. Overall, for a movie 30 years ago, I'll give this one 4 stars. This movie is better than some of Christopher Lee's Dracula movies (Dracula A.D 1972 and the Satanic Rites of Dracula...BOMBS!!)."
5,For fans and audiophiles.,"I've been an avid Ellington afficionado for quite some time, and I must say this collection is the holy grail for any Ellington collector. Aside from the historical significance of these selections, the expert musicianship and previously unavailable bonus material, the remastering is impeccable. I don't believe that any available material by Ellington exists with the sonic excellence of many of these selections. For those who have never heard the Duke live in person, here is the closest you are going to get. For beginners, there are other compilations(eg Sony's centennial 3CD set) that offer a better intro, but for fans of any intensity and audiophiles this is a must own."
3,Companion Piece To The 24 CD RCA Box,"I was just looking this up on Amazon & noticed the other reviews. What no one seems to have mentioned is the main purpose of this release was to fill the few holes in his RCA owned masters that were left out of the 24 cd boxThe Centennial Edition: Complete RCA Victor Recordings.This could have easily been a single disc or at most a 2 cd set, as Tanglewood & Eastbourne are on the 24 cd box & Mosaic has the Mary Lou Williams piano festival recordings available on a single cd called ""The Jazz Piano"", but again this set is aimed at DE completists who bought the 24 cd box & were not given quite his complete RCA catalog as promised (there was a bit of an uproar among DE collectors at the time regarding this issue). Though far from essential, The Reader's Digest sessions were especially hard to find before this release.Nice mastering also."
1,avoid,Arrived in loose packaging that didn't prevent the nonstick coating from being dinged and chipped. Sides were warped. It is REALLY big. Would take two burners on a conventional sized Whirpool gas range to adequately heat the cooking surface area. Returned for defects mentioned.
3,"Beware, VHS Edition!","Ensure that you get the 2003 version of this book. I mistakenly ordered the 2001 printing, which came complete with two VHS tapes. If the DVD is required for your class/curriculum, ensure that you pay attention to the year and description."
2,don't get this one-- get the green one it's your move--tough puzzles,the green one is brilliant-- i couldn't put it down. the positions in the blue version make no sense to me and ward doesn't explain much.
2,after just 2 questions,"after just 2 questions i'm disappointed.My initial fide rating is 2017.i've started with the 1st question in a waiting room, and i found the correct answer immediately (but didn't check if it was the right one). It was a strategic question. Then i go home, i put the position on the board, and after a long analysis i found that another answer, a tactical one, was strategically wrong but it wins too. The author think that this winning move is the worse of them all, becouse it's strategically wrong. This is really questionable.In the second question i have another surprise. The first choice of the author is ok, but the second (tied) loose some advantage, and it looks weaker than 4th choice.I know that it's not easy to put in order 5 choice in a won position, but i was expecting something more from the book, since there are just 50 questions."
4,Good Content But Mediocre Presentation,"This should have been the definitive guide to Crusade. From the point of view of content, it certainly was. The plot summaries and critiques were well-written and comprehensive. There was little left out that should have been there. However, the book itself left much to be desired, beginning with pictures. Most guide books to television series, as The Watcher's Guides of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel: Casefiles contain numerous pictures, usually in color. There were NO pictures in this book; at least there should have been pictures of the cast and the basic sets. The printing itself was too dark; spaces between paragraphs were too small, making the book less easy to read. I feel that the publisher did not do justice to what could have been an outstanding book. I actually give the book 5 stars for content and 1 star for publication."
4,Beer Swingin Fun,"Blood Or Whiskey are far better than the overrated Flogging Molly.They have a pure irish sound that just makes you wanna jump up and skank around like a lunatic.This has to be my fav. irish influenced cd.The standouts on this baby are the songs ""Chloe"" and ""When You Sing"".""Chloe"" just wants to make you sing along to the chorus of it.And ""When You Sing"" is THE BEST song to sing along to if your sad or mad, the catchy chorus ""Let your pain just leave you when you sing she said"" is like therapy for a hurt soul.However the reason i gave it 4 stars is that it is SOO much irish influenced that it might turn some people away.If your thinking that it is like ""Dropkick Murphys"" or ""Flogging Molly"" you might be dissapointed because it does not have barely any regular guitar in it like the other 2 bands i said.Download the 2 songs that i stated above and if you dont like those two i wouldnt say this cd is for you.Other than that its a great pick up for getting drunk and singing along to."
3,if ur in the mood,"Well, if ur in the mood for some ol' timey backwoods Irish folk rock, than this is the album for you. If u want something a little more hardcore, stick to the fail-safes....such as Flogging Molly or Dropkick Murphys. The Pogues are always a good choice for the in between. As for this album...only listen to it w/ a bottle and some heartache."
4,REAL Irish roots music,"If you like real Irish roots music ie. The Pogues, The Dubliners, buy this CD. If you're more into over produced pseudo punk bands like Flogging Molly or Dropkick Murphy's, then don't. Blood or Whiskey are very good songwriters who mainly play trad Irish instruments. This is great drinking music, and is perfect for arond St. Paddy's Day and all year long."
2,TERRIBLE!,"ok...well if you wanna waste $11.98 than buy this cd cuz thats all you'll be doing is wasting it. I suggest you go out and buy Drunken Lullabies, Swagger, or Within a Mile of Home by Flogging Molly. Blood or Whiskey may be irish but they need to think up a better career...i was very disapointed, especially after having listened to dropkick murphys and flogging molly and then listenin to them..."
1,Is this a joke!,"For being ""one of the greatest guitarists of all time"" (right!), the music on this recording is about the most cliché and simplistic music ever writtten save for perhaps the most introductory and basic studies any amateur guitarist could play. Don't waste your time or money unless you'd like a laugh. (The one star rating is because you can't submit zero stars)."
3,"Works w/ iPhones, but not iPods!",I ordered this item with the hope that it would work both with my iPhone 4 and iPod classic. But this one does charge the iPhone but not the iPod. A bit disappointing. But charging the iPhone works fine...
1,"Car charger for ipod, nano 3g, ipod classic, ipod touch","Car charger stopped working after 3 1/2 months of use. Use caution when ordering. Charger was left in same place and take care of. When contacted the company for refund or to get another, i was declined."
1,Product not what is pictured!!,Be very weary of Blue Harbor Online. The company sent me a product that was nothing like the description or what was pictured.
2,Warning! This item doesn NOT work with iphone 3GS,Warning! This item does NOT work with iphone 3GS. However it will power a older style ipod. I mistakenly purchased this charger (can't beat the price) but it does not work with the newer iphone's
3,works but had a weird affect on my ipod,"This product served its purpose as an iPod charger, quite nicely. But if I was to plug in a dead iPod, it would cause my iPod to totally reset."
2,Low quality.,"I found that I got what I paid for. Item is of very low quality. If the phone is already juiced up a bit, charger will work fine. But if u try to charge when ur phone is switched off, it doesnt work. And charging time is very slow!"
2,Annoying buzzing sound,"I bought this to charge my iPod in the car. Unfortunately, it adds an annoying buzz to anything I listen to. The buzzing is very loud when the iPod backlight is on, but drops down some once the backlight turns off.I had intended to leave the iPod plugged into the charger all the time, but to avoid the buzzing I only plug in the iPod when the battery is low.For all I know, this might happen with any charger I buy. In case it matters, the car is a Toyota Prius.The charger was only a penny plus shipping and handling, so maybe I shouldn't be complaining."
3,okay,"It works. Shoddy chinese workmanship but it does the job... If you got a few extra bucks get an American version, otherwise, this does the job for the time being."
1,Not Compatible With New iPods,"Apple's new generation of devices (the 3G iPhone, the 2nd gen iPod touch and the 4nd gen iPod nano) no longer support 12v FireWire style charging, they only support 5v USB style charging. This adaptor will not work on the above listed devices. Apple has been slowly dropping FireWire support from the iPods, so expect this to be the case will all future devices as well."
1,dangerous product,"We bought this for a road trip with our children. It worked for the first day. The next time we plugged it in, it started smoking. This product isn't even worth the low price."
2,It Broke!,"The cord broke a month after buying it. It worked great up until then and I was very pleased. However, I was hoping for it to last a lot longer."
4,IT does the job and it works with the iphone 4,"Feels cheap but hey, for the price, i cant complain. It worked with our Iphone 4, 3GS, 3G, and 2G. We happen to have all the iphones models. Cable is not short but it ain't long either."
2,Did not work....,didn't work with my verizon iphone4. I liked the white color so gave it 2 stars other than that it would have only got 1 star from me.
3,Not compatible with 3rd Gen iPod,"I ordered this because the description says it is compatible with the ""iPod 3G"". I have the third generation iPod and it does NOT work with the adapter I received. The adapter I received has a label saying ""FOR 3G iPhone"". I do not believe the adapter for the iPhone 3G is the same as the adapter for older iPods. When I tried it, my iPod just froze up and did not charge. I contacted the seller three times but they refused to acknowledge their error and send me another adapter. Either they sent me the wrong adapter or the adapter does not work as advertised. Do not do business with these people."
3,only if it fits,"Good product, it does work but only if it fits. It doesn't fit phone with otter box, GOOD GRIEF!! I'LL TAKE A KNIFE AND CUT THE SIDES TILL IT WILL FIT. MORE THAN ONE WAY TO SKIN A CAT.:)"
1,"not as advertised,",It did not work or was the wrong charger. I have an iPod Classic and it would not charge on the car charger I was sent.
4,Finally ! It is safe to buy new music !,"I love instrumental music. I actually heard about this guy on an MP3 site for New Age music. I visited his MP3 site and loved the music. The reason that I am only giving 4 out of 5 stars is due to the fact that there is not enough singing on this album. I really liked the stuff on his MP3 page...Friends, Child Without a Name...but, the album is unbelievable. I am no longer afraid to go out and try new music !"
1,Kinda disappointed.,"The last 2 cd's have been a disappoint for me and will most likely never make it into my cd player. The album ""The company you keep"" was great, but both of these seem overproduced. You can't hear enough of his guitar playing and the song writing seems like he is just throwing words together that seem to rhyme instead of actually writing a song with meaning. Note to John: You turned me on to guitar playing so that is what I prefer from you. No horns or piano. It just muttles up the song. Take a little more time between records if you need to because the quality of songs seems to be going down the faster you pump them out. Until you have at least 4 great songs on the cd, don't put it out. Sorry if this sounds harsh, but you are too good of artist for this."
4,nice club experience - hence the title,"Well, just created this amazon account and bought this album today. Dunno what to say, simply put, a pretty nice trance cd. It may get pretty repetitve and also has some nice collection of vocal songs. 4 stars but almost 5, just an opinion from me..."
1,Bad Chick Flick!,I bought it for my girl friend we watched it and it will probably never be opened again. Movie was boring and the characters were not very interesting.
1,"Worth a Dollar, No More!","Purchased New for $1.00 at Wally World. That's all it's worth. Very poor transfer to DVD. Plot, storyline and action are okay, but audio is terrible. You get what you pay for!"
5,European music at it's best!,"If you've been to Europe and spent some time going dancing or just hanging around at night in a bar or found yourself walking down the streets filled with people just having fun, This music is for you. Tino Casal is a great artist and although his music is almost two decades old it is still the best! So pop in the CD and enjoy life. My favorite songs are ""Embrujada"" and ""Stupid Boy"". I feel like i'm back in Madrid everytime i listen to this CD."
5,Does this book contain recipes?,"Sorry everyone, this is a question, not a review! I just purchased Dr. Pitcairn's holistic health book, and this one looks like it is a great companion to that book. However, I was disappointed by the lack of recipes in the Pitcairn book-- does this book contain recipes?If not, can anyone recommend a good recipe book for homecooking?Thanks!"
3,Common Sense,"I had to buy this book for college, and it was boring. Most of it is common sense, and the course was boring."
3,Sharp cash register with scanner,"Cash register works ok. Bar scanner does not work at all in the sunlight! We bought it to use in a fireworks tent, and had to create dark shade to get it to work during the day.The logo feature is not very good for the register receipt. It never comes out like you want it, and it is VERY limited as to what you can do."
4,Great For Small Stores,"I purchase this from Costco almost 2 years ago, never had any problems. Very easy to use and very easy to set up. Programming items to scan was the most easiest part. I have never seen any register that is so easy to set up.The only problem is I can only programme 7,000 items, it seems a lot when I first purchase it but 2 years later memory is full and I am stuck with this register. I finally upgrade to a ""unlimited"" scan item pos and this will be up for sale.Long story short this register is highly recomended for a very small business/retail store. But if you sell lot of items and get new items on daily basis you should look for a better register. I am giving 4 stars because I never had any problems with this, I wish it can programme more than 7,000 items."
1,Stone age,"Ecr is useless for computerized inventory control. Software reminds me of old DOS, and just as useful. Not compatible at all with vista. Even the use of the SD card is useless."
1,Cash register,"The first shipment I received on this order was the wrong register. It was an XE-A102. The shipping ticket had XE-A505 in the description, then XE-A102 on the line below it, which I assume is why the packer picked out the A102. I immediately returned the items and requested a replacement. Much to my disappointment, I got the exact same WRONG register again with the same problem on the shipping ticket.When I called about the problem, I was told that since the customer service rep I was talking to could not solve problems at the warehouse, my only solution was to have my money credited back to me. So I ended up ordering the register from another company.I think there should be some way that an order can be tracked to a particular warehouse and they should be made aware of packing problems. It seems that anyone who orders this register will have this problem and it should be investigated and corrected."
3,does not seem like the old Battlestar Galactica,This isnt Battlestar Galactica the way i used to remember it.This reminds me of Galactica 1980 for some reason.That show didnt have the original cast and characters and it left the viewer with thats not Battlestar Galactica.This book has the original characters and the feeling i get is the same. not like the old galactica.How can Apollo and Sheba hang around together for so long in the tv show become just friends in this book.They hardly spoke to each other.In Armageddon{ i love that book} they were going to be sealed.Now its Apollo with cassiopeia.no way thats Starbucks girl!Bojay and Sheba messing around.I always thought they were related!This book should not have been written this way.to much change for me .I love the cover thats why i give it three stars.I hope Richard Hatch writes the next book set back in the past just like the tv show and without stan timmons.
2,oops,"I am a die hard BG fan. I also adore Richard Hatch, or at least Apollo's character. I read all the reviews before I bought teh books, but honestly I didn't want to believe they were bad. I chose to believe the one optimistic review. My mistake. The first two books were okay, a little slow in the action and kind of beating one event to death. But the last book was horrible. All of the characters were suddenly out-of-character and the action failed to keep my attention. i continued reading only because i prayed that something would improve. It didn't. I don't believe I will be buying the last book. The memories I have and the way I believe the characters are from the series will sustain me more than one of these books will. It is only with the deepest regret that I do not endorse these books."
3,Great SCI FI book,This is a good book if you liked the old battlestar. Worth the money but it is a short book that will only take you a weekend to read.
2,Mediocre writing kills the story,"This is one difficult book to read, even for a huge Galactica fan such as myself. I found the first book (Armageddon) to be very well written and plotted, while the second (Warhawk) was well written but not as entertaining. But the writing this time around relies too much on exposition. It's tedious when each line or exchange of dialog is followed by one or more paragraphs of background or insight. It just happens too frequently in this book for my taste. I'll leave the actual story review to others who had less of a problem with the writing style."
5,This is a great read.,This book is more interesting than the Titanic. The icing is the scholarly tone and the sophisticated literal agility of the Italian author.
2,The hinges have definitely fallen off this Gate,"Sadly, despite some decent creature effects ranging from an actor in a demon costume to old school stop-motion animation, Gate II offers very little to the viewer with it's sub-standard storyline and dull characters. One never really feels that the four teens are in that great a danger...and the low budget seems to have had a greater affect on the production this time around. A surprisingly disappointing sequel (considering that the 1987 original was so well done) that is recommended for the unwavering, die-hard Gate fan only. Gate II was filmed in 1989 but sat on the shelf for three years until the resolution of distribution problems earned it a limited (yet ultimately unsuccessful) theatrical release in 1992.RATING: ** out of *****"
2,Gate 2,This was a good quality DVD but not the best movie. It would have been better with Stephen Dorf. Stick to watching Gate the original.
3,"Short, but interesting","This is a relatively short book, but interesting to anyone researching Liszt at all.It's depressing to find such a great human being could be so coldly treated at a very vulnerable time of his life.The commentary by Mr. Walker is very interesting also.Not a fluid read, but noteworthy just the same.I guess these things happened to many people in history and were very much kept hush-hush for obvious reasons..."
3,3 stars for 4 good songs,"This album wasnt what I expected. It seems more bland than the others. The only songs I like are # 2,3,7,and 11. 7 reminds more a eurotrash. 2 and 3 are more of there new sound and 11 is new too. Overall this album was more of a dissappointment to me because I really like the other 2 cds. Hopefully future releases will be better."
1,How lame!!!!,"I don't know why great bands think they have to change their style and turn emo, but it seems that so many of them are doing that these days. First to go was Apoptygma Berzerk, than Godhead, than Zeromancer, and more recently even Marilyn Manson slipped into this lame style of music. This album was sooooooo dissapointing. For a Zeromancer fan, words simply can not explain the emotional dammage I suffer. I feel entittled to a lawsuit against the band for bringing me back into depression. I hate it when bands sell out and try to appeal to the pop masses of floppy haired emo kids and silly little bubble gum teenagers who wouldn't know good music if it landed on their ears. This album royally sucks and it's not worth the price of butter. Don't even bother unless your into sappy indie music with little to no point. If your new to Zeromancer, start anywhere prior to this record and you'll be quite satisfied with some verry well done coldwave metal."
4,Good Episode,"This was your average good story. Though he isn't in it very much, it's great to see everyone's favorate Cobra agent Storm Shadow wiping the floor with US Army soldiers in the Pentagon and then later doing the same to two of Scarletts brothers. Storm Shadow doesn't have as many major appearances in the tv series as Destro and Cobra Commander but he is one of the more popular ones. Sort of like BoBa Fett in Star Wars."
1,As bad as the Complete peachtree with fewer features!,"We are not in an industrial age any more! We want better software, much easier to use, and better interface. Why Peachtree is that hard? Remember DOS? How hard it was when Windows came about? Now peachtree is like that if you have used better software: Old tech."
1,Want a refund..............,"I am totally disgusted with this Peachtree Accounting 2005. Bought it in December, have not used it yet cause it is so darn complicated. Been reading the ""User's Guide"" that comes with the software and finally made a call to the tech support (it was still free-not charging me yet)to ask them. Told them we were a small company, I wanted to know how to enter our employees and let ME figure their paychecks without entering tax tables or buying their tax service. The tech told me how and I asked him to give me a page number in the ""User's Guide"" so I could look it up and follow along. Well, guess what?? It is NOT in the ""User's Guide""!!! Not sure what good a ""User's Guide"" does for me if the company only puts in instructions that benefit THEM-they want you to sign up for The Peachtree Payroll Tax Service, which of course, is NOT free. Also, talked to our personal CPA and he said you almost had to be an accountant to be able to use it. So I have given up!!!"
2,Beware of Registered Peachtree Products,"Once a Peachtree product has been registered, you cannot legally sell it to another person. I know this fact from experience. After migrating to QuickBooks Pro, I contacted Best Software to find out how to ""unregister"" my Peachtree Accounting 2004 in order to sell. The customer representative informed me that once I registered my product, it had become mine, PERMANENTLY. At the very least, the only option available to me was disposal.So before making your Peachtree purchase, make sure the seller has not registered the product. Also, keep in mind that Peachtree software must be registered after fifteen uses, or else you will be locked out. And once you register, Peachtree is yours FOREVER!"
2,"Not Bad, but there are better alternatives.","Peachtree is ok, but I do not recommend it for several reasons:1. It has a very old interface. Make you tired and bored after a while!2. Very complex. For example, you have to type 10.00, instead of just 10!3. Old technology: Now we are in 2005 not in 1990!And other thing I did not like.I would personally recommend Small Business Manager (SBM) from Microsoft http://www.microosft.com or another alternative and less expensive is Quick Business Manager (QBM) from Business Aim http://www.bisaim.com. There other software I could recommend but it seems that these two are really using great technologies such as Microsoft .Net and SQL Server. Good Luck."
4,Kids areNondivorceable,This is a good book to have as an addition to your library. It is helpful in letting children know they are not alone and that thy are still loved even in the face of divorce.
3,Skippy,"I like it because it holds so many more pics, but when you go to take video, and play it back on the camera or the comp ot the tv, it skips like crazy. It is not my camera, because I checked in two of my others. It still did it.But so worth for the many more pics."
5,Great Buy!,I have the Olympus E 500 and this card works well for it. My suggestion is to buy two of these if you don't have one. The 512 MB are small and fill up quickly. You could save money buying two of these instead of one larger one. My point is there are great cards but for those who shoot a lot you need more space then just one of these cards.
2,Disappointing,This item does not work in my HP Photosmart 9060 printer so I am unable to download pictures trhough my printer.
5,Jeep Fuel Guage,"This Fuel Guage is what I needed to fix my jeeps factory guage,that did't work.If your having trouble with your factory guage get this one.Price was right and at a good price!I put this in my 1977 jeep cj5.Thanks for reading."
1,Utterly horrible,"After we played this CD, we found ourselves having to comfort the neighborhood children who were convinced that an animal was dying a painful death in our house.It's really awful. Are we sure this isn't a joke? Maybe it's some kind of ""Weird Al"" take on lounge singers ...Keep the day job."
3,packaging,The product was a 2-CD package. The plastic holders for each CD were broken upon arrival. The holders were either broke before shipment or during shipment. The mailer the product was sent in could have been more firm and secure.
4,Strange But...I can't stop listening,I saw these guy's about a year ago and bought this album at the show. I liked them alot. I put the cd on and it rarely leaves the changer. Not earth shattering but I can't stop listening to it.
5,Comfortable glasses,"These are really lightweight and comfortable glasses. They are not terribly dark, but I wasn't looking for dark glasses. They do a good job at cutting glare and brightness without compromising visibility."
2,Not for use as a rug,"I bought one of these intending to use it as an easy-to-wash rug/floor mat in a kitchen where we need to dry up water spills. It is not good for that purpose at all. It doesn't lie flat enough to use as a rug. The bumps in the surface and around edges cause people to trip on it. It may make a good horse blanket, but don't attempt to use it as a rug. I guess I would consider this my mistake for trying to use it for a purpose other than what it was intended for."
1,beautiful but very fragile,"i bought this watch for my wife for christmas. it is very beautiful, however, within a few months the face was so scratched that you could barely tell the time. she is kind of rough on watches, but it seemed as though sliding the face across a pillow would scratch it."
3,Audio killed the silent screen star,"A memorable composite biopic about a silent film comedy star who has trouble handling success, and then falls afoul of the advent of sound. The film quotes scenes from other famous movies. For example, the main character voices-over his own funeral, a la _Sunset Boulevard_. But it is a memorable production for its own sake. We follow the comic from success straining his marriage, to his star on the wane, to attempts at a comeback, until we leave him as a pathetic wreck, old and full of regrets, watching one of his old films on late night TV. Affecting stuff..."
1,"Unfortunately, disappointing","I looked forward to seeing this, but have to say that it was disappointing. It seems superficial, with the acting just passable. I'd guess that Carl Reiner's writing and direction are the problems. No subtlety, or cleverness. Dick Van Dyke does his best, but the material seems very thin. Too bad."
2,Fooled Again!,"I was not inspired by this book at all!! You want to be inpsired and learn fusion buy the dvd by Carl Veyners Interal Rock now that will inspire you and show you how to play such fusion licks, not a book of scales theory and a jazz backer!Or I recommend to buy Don Mocks Matercalss turarounds learn a master meolody and go with it!"
1,Misleading name and irrelevant content,"This book provides detailed information on the modes of the major scale and melodic and harmonic minor scales with 3 note per string and in position-CAGED style fingering patterns. Unfortunately, it provides no specific information for fusion guitar. The title is misleading and the content has nothing to do with the fusion guitar style. If you are looking for some sort of a condensed guitar scales encyclopedia, you can benefit from this book. This was not my aim when I purchased it, therefore, I consider it to be a waste of time and money."
2,Disappointed,"After reading the reviews I expected more. I'm sure there are nuggets in the book and I will continue to work it into my practice. However, it's not very practical in its presentation. The CD appears to be an after thought and is never referred to in the book. Only a little index on the title page identifying the tracks. When explaining a specific mode scale it would be helpful to be directed to a specific track number on the CD. The tracks on the CD are short, canned and only the backing vamp. Since the essence of modes is the sound a sample of each mode played over the vamp would have been very helpful. I like books that instruct and inspire. Sorry but this was weak on both."
3,Mostly Theory,"The book is fine, but perhaps doesn't have enoughripping solos. Also ""beware"" the other reviews,many of them come from Utah which is wherethe author is from ( a little fishy? )!"
3,no eroticism but dark and creepy film work.,"Nagisa Oshima's follow up to his hit IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES is some wath of a disappointment, but is good too, making it so so film (a lot of them). But I do not know why TLA VIDEO AND DVD GUIDE calls it ""erotic ghost story of unremitting passion"". 1 could be that there was some sex scenes cut from the film (the video cover says it to be 180 mins but TLA says 110 mins), but as IMDB.com recalls that there are no missing scenes reported. Or 2 can be that film reviewers these days have forgotten wath real eroticism is, because there is nothing sexy at all in this film, and the only sex scenes in the film are too dark to see and not that nice to look at. Any way the story line is that a man and the woman he has had a affair with kill her husband to be together, but with a horror twist put into it as the man's ghost comes back to haunt them. Dark and creepy themed film.1978. Fox. 108 MINS.Rated R for General Tone and Some Sexuality."
4,Sexy Countryside Melodrama,"At last, Oshima's movies were produced on DVD with reliable info on English subtitles: all the previous stuff just combined Japanese, French and Chinese wording, misleadingly mentioning a range of language options available.Although contexts of these movies are understandable even without text ( Ai no corrida- (""In the Realm of the Senses"" is a nice soft-porno work exploring mutilation and incest much prior to other Japanese movies of the end of the last twentieth century), The Empire of Passion (L' Empire de la passion / Ai no borei (Original Japenese with French Version Included - No English Options)) is a simple story of lust and love in the Japanese countryside of the ninetieth century fall, where emotions and traditional local mysticism emphasised on a backstage of sexual explorations.Beautiful cast acting convincingly adds to positive comprehension of this ordinary melodrama."
1,This is the same movie as Empire of Passion!,"This is the same movie, albeit not as good technical quality, as Empire of Passion. Do nbot make the same mistake I did, thinking this was The Realm of the Senses."
3,It saddened me.,"This film contains so much violence, paranoia, and madness. The story is kinda slow, but the ending is quite heart-shaking and depressing. The cinematography is almost like film noir."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"Completely unwatchable drivel. In the Realm of Senses pushed the envelope with its sexual themes and graphic depictions of sexual acts. In the Realm of Passion seems to want to capitalize on that, but it fails miserably. No real plot (some sort of insanity and a ghost story of some kind), sex, and nothing interesting or engaging at all here. Do not bother with this."
3,Pretty Good,"In the Realm of Passion is the companion piece to Nagisa Oshima's ... In the Realm of the Senses. The film is a ghost story, dealing with guilt and revenge. Several good scenes. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS."
3,Good for beginners,The color pictures and good care advice make this a useful first book on turtles. Some incorrect information is mixed in (e.g. the Asian box turtle[tropical and aquatic] is said to be cared for like the Chinese box turtle [temperate and terrestrial]). And the lack of an index makes it useless at a quick resource.
2,dated,"INteresting and beautifully presented,but some informations are utterly dangerous,as the advice to give tortoises(Vegeterian) canned dog's food.This can provoque some shell deformation and food deficiences.These informations are dated and misleading for a new owner.Beautiful photos,though,and good understanding of turtles ' behaviour."
2,Could be better,"It does not cover most of the turtle species, little information on breeding and important stuff, it is more like a magazine than a book, good pictures though."
2,Not Quite...,"I got the Razr for it's sleek styling but this cover, which I was hoping to be a slim fit leather, made the phone quite a bit bulkier. I thought the production quality was rather cheap. There were uneven stitches and crooked seams.It does it's job, but not a product I would recommend."
3,Good quality for the $$,"My original shield from the AT&T store was a bit better quality, but this is ok. It doesn't look too ""cheap"". I've had it for 3 months now and the black plastic around the camera part had broken off, not a huge deal. The clip works really well."
3,Good monitor...if it works,"I've had this monitor about a week. Upon getting it and hooking it up I was very impressed with the brightness of the screen and the quality of images. Although when using the web text, particularly smaller text, is very fuzzy and looks like it fades.However, today I encountered a major problem. DO NOT use the highlight feature. While exploring what my monitor could do I pressed the highlight button to highlight a portion of my screen and it seems to have blown out the backlight on the monitor. Now everything is nowhere near as bright as it was when I purchased the monitor except for a few seconds after returning on the highlight feature. My IE pages now appear off white unlike the brillient white they were just earlier today.I'll be returning this to Samsung for a replacement."
1,Too good to be real,"Without a doubt the picture quality and features are excellent. The size, flat screen contour, price, and picture clarity make this an excellent value monitor. Unfortunately, I only got 4 weeks use out of mine averaging 15 hours per week before it went kaput. I am being told that an IC on the CRT board has failed. I get no picture whatsoever, although the on-screen prompts for picture settings are visible. Undoubtedly this deal seemed too good to be real. Alas, it was not real at all."
1,"Run, Don't Walk","As a computer professional I have purchased hundreds of monitors over the past 10 years. I have never purchased a worse one that this. I see that many of the problems I experienced have been documented by others here. I'll recap:1. Blurry text. It was almost unreadable at the edges of the screen2. I had the choice of the screen looking like this ( ) or ) (. No amount of playing with the controls would change it.3. The top left corner was ""scrunched"" and again, nothing could fix it.4. The whole screen was rotated about 5 degrees. And as with everything else, it could not be fixed.Run, don't walk, away from this monitor. The one and only redeeming feature is the price."
5,Awesome,"i can't belive how much of a diffrence this new monitor makes. I went from an old 17"" Dell monitor. this new 19""(18"" view) is great. words cant decribe how wonderful this monitor really is. i love it."
1,Read The Reviews!!! Fuzzy Text is Coming!!!,I have had this monitor for 2 years and the text is unreadable unless you have it set 1t the lowed DPI and the refresh rate low. so beware!
2,Blurry till it has been on for a few hours,"I don't know if the monitor I bought is defective but have never had a problem with picture quality before and as soon as I hooked this up I saw the screen images were blurry. So much so that I could not use it. I hooked it up late at night, saw the screen and left it on overnight thinking I would unhook it and ship back for refund. In the morning it was ok basically, not great picture but not blurry. What's the deal, piece of junk?"
3,Good Image--Noisy Tube,"The SyncMaster 955DF is a great Shadow Mask monitor, and is especially sharp with text. 3 stars only because it is an exceedingly noisy monitor. It's tube emits high frequencies but not high enough for human ear. I returned the monitor to the merchant. The noise might not be heard in a noisy showroom but will (considering you have a good hearing) in a quite room. Overall, if you are hard of hearing, or is not bothered by a high frequency buzz (not the type a regular TV emits, but much louder and lower in frequencies--I would say, in the 15,000 Hz) then get this monitor."
3,You get what you pay for,"This monitor is not for people who are perfectionists and must have everything perfect, this monitor just does not have what it takes for these people. Yes it has a flat screen, but it is not possible to make it geometrically square and text is less that satisfactory. Does look good for games however. This is a middle grade monitor for a decent price."
5,Great Monitor,"This monitor is great. I was skeptical as it was a samsung instead of a big name monitor company but pleasantly surprised. It would be my top choice for a 19"" monitor on a budget or even as a mid range choice."
4,"Great price, good monitor, not spectacular","I bought this monitor for a great price, and it is plenty big and plenty flat.My old comment stated there were problems with my monitor; I've since found that they were problems with my KVM switch and its capability to drive this monitor at high resolutions. Any modern KVM switch would have no problems, mine is *old*."
3,"it's a ""decent"" product","to all consumers shopping for a pc monitor! Samsung Dynaflat Syncmaster 955DF 19"" CRT Monitor is decent monitor. It's not the best of quality but it's suitable. I've only used it for a couple of days and realize it has some problems with full mode view. It seems to function well with high quality JPEG and MPEG. But with low quality it has extremely poor imaging. I've use windows media player 7.0, and view files at full mode, and gotten worse quality compared to my old regular dell CRT. With high quality files, this monitor enhances the beauty of the images, so it's not a complete lost nor great bargain. It's a fair valued item."
5,Wow,"This monitor is the best that I have seen. I have friends with the expensive trinitron, Dell, Compac, and HP. This monitor is clearer than all of them. I first bought one for my mother on Mother's Day and loved it so much that when i got my new computer I had to get one. It's just as crisp and clear as hers. Photos are brillant and the text is crisp as can be.The monitor is BIG and requires a lot of space but at this price and having the best picture, it's worth the large size. You won't be sorry."
1,don't buy it.,i bought 2 same model monitors..they are worse........bz i don't know that much english..don't know how to explain. but i know little about computers.....my first one monitor i found a ditc on it...then second is the worest one...the electric gun is broken down when i was arrive.DON'T BUY IT.
1,blur text drives me crazy.,I bought this monitor April 2001 and now its blur text drive me crazy. Playing with the control doesn't help. I am disppointed and will dump it.
1,bad monitor - very fuzzy,"Don't buy this monitor - after a couple of years of use, the graphics and text are so blurry it's impossible to read anything. Several attempts to ajust color, focus, etc. resulted in no improvement. Samsung support was of no help."
3,Joanna LIVE,"Joanna she's begin her career in 1979, nowdays whitout questions she's had a influence in her interpretations, she singer like Simone and Maria Bethania. And offcourse is better listen Simone and Bethania than Joanna, but she has her own value, bye the way the best song is when she singer Milton Nascimento.But also you can hear Milton's song in Simone and Bethnia CDs."
4,inspiring,"Whether this is the 'authentic' voice of Eckhart or not, it is an excellent book about spirituality and the approach to God. it makes God accessible. Rather than treat God as only worthy of being worshipped from afar, it brings the creation in intimate contact with the creator. One with Him. And the new way of looking at the Bible and Religion from an intimate perspective, branded Eckhart as a heretic. Of course, often in Religion you were burned or considered a heretic if you got too close to God. I loved this book and thought Matthew Fox did a wonderful job of bringing these ideas to modern english language."
5,"25, great boyfriend, successful, and still searching for his folks approval and love",Very good read. Michael is 25 and is sitting at his folks dining table enduring his 16 year old sarcastic 16 year old goth sister and his knucklehead older brother along with his mom's clueless wish to fix him up with a friends daughter... when he is finally able to get out the words (barely) that his friend Dan who is also sitting there... is his boyfriend. Yeah oh by the way I'm gay folks. Shortly after this bombshell is dropped his mom receives a call letting her know that their favorite aunt has died... this initiates a gathering of the clan and the drama builds.
1,"Nice in theory, terrible implementation",The latch is pitiful. The phone fits nicely but that latch is NOT secure. With in 30 minutes of having it my phone came out and hit the tile floor at a customer's house. Tons of fun watching your $500 PDA hit the ground and the battery come flying out.Phone is ok but the case is getting replaced ASAP!!DO NOT GET THIS CASE!!
1,The cheap plastic clip makes this case overpriced.,"I have no issues with the case itself, but, as with some of the other reviewers, I, too, had the plastic clip break on me after just a few days' use. Very disappointing."
2,"Protection, with drawbacks","Advantages:1) Superior protection: I have dropped my phone twice onto concrete and there has been no damage to phone or case.2) All buttons accessible, though a bit difficult to get to in cases.Disadvantages:1) Signal quality is worse when the phone is in the case!2) Belt clip useless, since the case can easily open, spilling out the phone when on one's belt.3) Side ""ok"" button difficult to press, same with top two front front buttons (above ""start"" and ""ok"" buttons).Summary:Usable only for protection during transportation, and does this well.Phone should be removed from case during usage."
4,"A little bulky, but does it protects the phone","I recently purchased the black metal case for my 8525, and have had a few problems w/it. First the belt clip is kind of small and broke when I tried to clip it to my belt. Second the aluminum case isn't the sturdiest, so now it's sort of bent (referring to the hinge, I guess I've been really rough on my phone), but I just bend it back to where it's supposed to be (referring to the hinge). But the case does what it's supposed to do...my phone looks and performs just as the day I got it. When I informed the vendor that the belt clip broke I just wanted a new clip, instead I recieved a full refund, so that was a pleasant suprise. I actually liked it so much I bought my wife one when she got her phone."
3,Great Looking Case but...,"This case looks great. Fits is good and all exterior buttons are accessible. However there are some major limitations. The design of the belt clip makes this thing sit pretty far off your belt (noticeable even with an untucked shirt). Additionally, I have no confidence in the latch that holds the front and back together. It is very easy to get open. If this happens while you are carrying it on your belt the phone will go scattering across the floor.Look elsewhere if you belt carry your phone. If you pocket carry, like I do, this case works fine."
2,"cheap, cheap, cheap","2 of the 4 U bolts cross threaded, and had to cut them off with a grinder. I had to go to the part store and buy more bolts. I tried to get the threads on the bolts to work, but no success. A one hour job turned into a three hour job. Before the project, I wanted to give them a five star rating, because how could you mess up 4 bolts and a block? Now I'm worried the cheap chinese steel is going to fatigue and break, resulting in an accident."
1,Did not work for my....,I bought this to lower the rear of my 2004 Dodge Dakota Quad Cab V8 2 inches to level it with the front. The U bolts aren't big enough for my axle.
4,Very good,I originally bought this book as I worked with her son.I was very satisfied with the story as well as amazon'sservice. Worthwhile reading
2,poor,I was very dispointed with the product I received. I didn't get what I ordered. I ordered enamel over srainless burner covers and received tin ones. If I wanted to buy tin ones I could get them anywhere. I will be sending them back.
5,"Great book, speedy delivery","Nice to be able to find what you need at Amazon. All the books are excellent, and delivered speedily."
5,wonderful book,"Love this book, great illustrations and very educational. My 3 year old loves for me to read this to him it is one of his favorite books. I would recommend this to anyone."
2,Thought it was a set. Wish I would have read more carefully.,Thought it was a set. Wish I would have read more carefully. Nice product otherwise. Wish I had all three towels.
3,You only get one towel,"The picture is a little misleading, although if I had really read about this, I would have known it was only one towel. I bought it because I thought the SET would be pretty in my bathroom. The towel is pretty, although not worth the price when I thought I was paying for a set. If you like the towel, buy it. Just beware that it is ONLY ONE towel."
2,Holiday Towel,"I too thought this was a set and felt deceived by the photo, my fault for not reading more carefully."
1,awful quality,"I washed the towel according to wash directions on the item, but the green and red bled onto the beige towel part - they are ruined...but as my husband said - we'll just fold them to cover that up!"
4,Steep Canyon Rangers,"I like this album. Sounds like traditional Blue Grass to me. I bought it after buying the ""Deep In The Shade"" album. I prefer the ""Deep In The Shade"" album, the material sounds more original to me."
4,this was very revealing!,this is one of my favorite documentaries on the subject.Its mostly interviews but has great footage as well.Worth getting.The only down side is the cross eyed alien abductee. Couldnt the aliens help him to see straight?LOL! worth getting!
1,GARBAGE,"There is absolutely nothing compelling, or thought provoking about this movie, If you are familiar with the folks in this DVD then you will simply hear them give a rehash of info you already know!!!!A good UFO DVD convinces the sceptic!! and you cannot do that by not explaining which scenes are just some CGI filler crap to make the movie go along or are these scenes actual verifiable UFO footage.Most of the material(DVDs,Videos) from Germany and Eastern Europe, does more harm to the serious study of ET phenomenon then supporting it!!!!!"
3,Good Music Bad Image,"It is very good With Berliner Philharmonic, but the quality of the DVD is very bad. I think is because of the DVD record in 1990."
1,Didn't work,"I was so excited to play this game again, but it didn't even work on any of my computers. :("
1,Does not appear to work with XP,"Tried 98 compatability settings, but still won't run under XP.Upgraded the kid's computer, but this game won't run on the new one. Dual Boot OS's for a 9 year old is a little much."
4,pretty kool game for kids!,Barbie magic hair styler is a cool game you can pick a barbie and pick wait she she will be and do u can make it a date wedding carrer and other stuff. i have hade this for a cuple of years now but it is still fun.
2,Grill top,"Very light weight and hard to clean, hard to fill with water and not spill all over the stove. If the product was a heavier metal, it would work a lot better, plus the top is a little rounded, it should be flat to cook the meat an even space from the stove top. I would not puchase this again"
1,Get what you pay for,"I thought it would be a great deal to get this, compared to others that cost up to $100, but in reallity is is not good at all, those grill marks on the picture do not happen, it ends up working almost like a bowed out skillet. Not happy at all with it, just added to the clutter in my kitchen."
5,Quedate,"Excellent song, specially the melody, plus soap opera is one of he best ones I have ever seen. I love the entire CD."
2,NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO PUT IT ON.,"This product was delivered broken. I would put 25% of the blame on FedEx Ground, but the product had absolutely no shipping protection of any kind inside. The shade did look quite bulky compared to the one I put on my 2003 Silverado, and it appears to be a little outdated, but I was ordering it for a 2002 dodge ram. Not bad, but I'm sure there's better options"
4,Easy to learn social research,"I was dreading taking this required course in collge, ""Methods of Social Research."" This was the required text and it has made my life easier. I could actually understand the concepts. I highly recommend this text book."
3,A good book but bad publishing practice,"I use this book for my method class for a long time. The content of the book is good. it does a good job of explaining complex concepts. The problem is that the book keeps having new editions in just a few years even if the content has little update, and each new edition has a higher price for my students. This practice creates unnecessary financial burden for my students. Now I have to think about dropping this book for my future teaching."
2,Low Printer,"Before I bought this printer, I had a similar one (an HP2420) that began to mal-function after using it for about a year. I thought it was just a ""bad egg among a bunch"", so I bought another one: this is a HP P3005. I bought this printer because it is a low printer that fits in my shelf where I station it. After using it a few months it began to make a similar noise and problems as the previous one. After resetting it a couple of times it is still working, but I would be cautious to buy another one of these models."
1,FAIL!,"I work at a hotel where we have 3 of these printers and ALL of them have the same problems. First, the paper frequently ""jams"" in that every 20-30 pages printed it stops printing because it detects a jam; when you open up the paper tray, however, you find a page that the printer has attempted to feed but failed - it's not even really jammed in the traditional sense. The ""jam"" happens less often when the paper tray is full so even though you can put a whole ream of paper into it you have to fill it up constantly so it won't ""jam"" as often. One other thing: when the pages feed out of the printer they do not collect together anything close to neatly. After a few pages, the pile quickly becomes a jumbled mess with some pages almost coming off the pile. Do not buy this overpriced piece of plastic."
1,DO NOT BUY,This is the first HP product that I was disappointed in. It jams frequently. I purchased two of these printers and after 2 years I had to throw them away.
4,Printer,We have (3) P3005 printeres in use. They are efficient and capable of handling even our heaviest workloads. We are pleased.
4,Expressive,"Saying of the Soul comes from deep within the author Syieve Locklair. He brings out the emotion of personal experience and gives voice to the often unspeakable. It speaks of love, loss and all of the stuff of the human experience in between. When an artist can open their hearts, bring us in with them and help us feel so deeply, it is a rare gift. Thank you for sharing this Mr. Locklair and keep writing your truth!!"
3,very slow,"The pacing of this DVD is very slow. I cannot imagine anyone sitting and watching the whole thing. Maybe it is designed to be a music video to play in the background while you are doing something else.Picture quality is not real sharp. If you have a big HDTV, the image quality will be pretty blurry compared to broadcast TV."
2,No inserts included and quality is erratic,"Ordered these in two sets, and it took a pretty long time to get them - about 2 weeks. Should've just bought them locally because this was a ripoff. I got the plastic holders, but no labels so had to spend time making my own. Not really a deal breaker, but the deal breaker was the quality of these. It's like they were rejects or something from a big office supply place because sometimes I couldn't even insert the plastic label holders into the slots. Would never order from this seller again."
5,hanging folders,"You need normal hanging letter sized folders? these are them, but pretty colors. Buy American wooo hoooo! Well maybe this is made in America, at least it's not a generic brand, pay a little extra for the brand name, but hopefully the profit is for an American company."
4,Functional and cute - conained one defective folder (per box),"Hanging folders are exactly as described. Buyers should be aware that each folder has the PendaFlex stamp on one side (which should be turned to face the back). Also, one folder in each box (I ordered two) was ""defective"" On one side (on both) the folder was folded over the metal hanging strip *very* crookedly - enough that the hanging strip did not lay flat in the filing cabinet and the top of the folder stuck out at a funny angle."
3,Ignore the picture,"While available in a variety of colors, as shown in the photo, this item is sold a single color at a time. Imagine my disappointment to open the box and find black, and only black, hanging file folders. I can't blame Amazon, as it says ""...Colored Hanging File Folders, Letter, 1/5 Cut Tabs, Black, 25/box"" in the description. Next time I'll look for the word ""Assorted."""
1,"poor quality control, lousy company, cheap product","Like some other reviewers mentioned, this company ""Pendaflex Essentials"" seems to have a HUGE problem with quality control, namely not including enough tabs & inserts into their hanging folders. I bought this box of 25 (product #81602) and there were not enough of the little plastic tabs, only 16 included not 25! There were 30 of the paper tabs to write on, but not enough inserts! Pretty pathetic if you ask me - Pendaflex is shorting their customers by doing this, and somebody needs to put a stop to it and call them on their deception."
3,These look like counterfits,"Every Pendaflex folder I have bought for the past 30 years said Pendaflex on it, including folders with recycled content. These have no markings at all. They are okay, but it looks to me like they are selling counterfit off brand folders as Pendaflex."
5,As described ..,"These work great with my filing cabinet and if the picture shows black then that might mean your getting black, don't know why others are making a big deal from it saying ""colored"", but if you step back a minute, black is a color and these types of folders usually come in the ugly yellow/white color, if that can even be called a color. So anyways, if you need some files I feel that these are a great buy."
4,Just what I needed,"Good price and just as advertised. The labels for the tabs are about as cheap as could be (just slips of paper to write on), but what do you expect. These are basic no-frills hanging folders.At any rate, these are a great deal if you want to feel like a Bureaucrat on a budget, as if there is such a thing!"
3,Caution! No Tabs & Inserts Included,"The Pendaflex files themselves are great. However, there were no tabs and inserts included in the boxes. The boxes clearly state that they are included. I had to go and buy them separately. I wondered why they were so cheap. I got my answer."
4,Loaded with information,"This was purchased as a gift and it fulfilled that purpose marvelously.There are lots of Colorado facts which are interestingly presented.This publication is out of print and dated, but it made a very pleasinggift. It can be also recommended for anyone interested in the greatstate of Colorado!"
3,owner,"The adapters work well, but the red and blue tag was just tape and came off after first use. Not hard to keep track of, but cheap solution to marking item does not work."
5,R12 to 134 Manifold adapters ATD-3525,These adapters worked as advertised.No problem with them.Quality appears to be good.
4,Baby is durable,I bought this same doll for my granddaughter when she was a baby and it never leaves her side. Needless to say it looks pretty worn so I bought her this new one because she loved the old one so much.
4,Good movie for children!,This is a nice adventerous movie for kids.Caty and her brother Thomas are kidnapped by the Lenape Indians and taken from their quiet Quaker circle.Caty learns as she lives with the Indians that they are not savages as she has thought but a people diffrent from her with feelings and souls just the same!
3,Second one was right,"...first video was damaged but Amazon's replacement service was exceptional. Second video works beautifully although there are a couple of historic points which are not accurate...the screw top for bottles was a 19th century invention, and due to the variation in the thickness of the tree bark at higher latitudes...the birch-bark canoe was occasionally used by the Lenape in the upper part of NJ. The dugout canoe would have been more appropriate since the setting of the story is supposed to have been in and around the Trenton-Philadelphia area. Clothing and habitat of the Lenape is accurate."
1,Too small and Too slippery,"The bag is narrow and difficult to fill. You invariably end up with a mess which gets even more messy because the bag is made from a very slippery plastic. I had no luck using this bag, even though I gave it two chances."
1,hard to use,this product really sucked for me and thats all I got to say it cost way more than it was worth . Postage was ridiculous and the box was huge for such a small item. BIG RIP OFF
5,RAP CLASSIC,"This is most possibly the illest rap cd to ever hit stores. The two headed monsta Black C and Mr Cee, along with company, Cellski and Hitman put together pounding beats, sick flows, and sweet hooks. The rhymes are very creative. The highlights of this album be ""Blue Bird"" best track on the LP, ""Bounce to this"" gets your pumped for the album. ""I Got my nine"". ""Niggaz on the jock"" ""M.N.O.H.P"" ""Pass the zig zags"" and ""Dedication"" but all the tracks pound. This gem from RBL Posse is a must have for any west coast rap fan."
2,Experimental scent,"I read all the reviews on this perfume thinking it would be great. However, from now on I think I won't chance buying online and instead going to a store and finding out how it smells on my skin. My body chemistry didn't jive with this scent."
3,question: corporate personhood,"I haven't read this book, so to those of you who have here is a question. Does this book address corporate personhood? I believe one of the greatest misinterpretations of the Constitution, and one of the most significant threats to our democracy is the current situation which gives corporations all the rights of ""persons"", free speech, privacy, etc. Does this book weigh in on this question?"
5,A two year old FAVORITE,"When my oldest daugher was two, we read this book at least once a night. My second daughter listened to it from age 2-3 twice a night and even brought to school (and the teacher read it 7 times in a row because of the constant 'again, agains' from the class). Now my three year old son is in love with this book. We read it at least twice a night and thanks to the constant repitition, he 'reads' it too! He loves this book so much he thanks Jesus at prayer time for 'Pizza Pat and the mice'.We have probably over 400 kids books and I swear this is the most read!"
5,nephew loves it,My nephew moved across country and this was his favorite book when he was in my daycare so i sent him this copy and he loves it.
4,Got What I Paid For,"This tile cutter came in and it feels like plastic. The customer ended up not taking it so i am stil sitting on it but for the price i paid, i got what i pad for."
1,Flimsy,"Tried to cut a 4"" tile. The tile would not snap, and wound up bending the front of the unit up from the floor, making it unusable.Do not buy..."
2,"All Good, No Bad...not necessarily good.",This book is good for the basics but it doesnt say much about the two most difficult things I'm dealing with with my baby hedgehog...nipping and litter training. I got much better advice online so if you read this and expect your hedgehog to be perfect and wear little hats in the garden as pictured in the book haha... you may want to do some more research first :) otherwise its good for basic info!
3,Decent information guide on Hedgehog care,"The book was an easy read and contained much information however, most of the information found in this book can be found on hedgehog community websites maintained with contributions by veterinarians, breeders, and life-long hedgehog owners. I read this book after spending time on a community website and didn't find that the book had anything new to tell me."
5,Must have for all Hedgehog owners,"Anyone interested in having a hedgehog as a pet, or just wants to learn about them needs to have this book. It's easy to read and very informative. As a hedgehog mom, I have been thankful that I've had this book on hand when I had a question about the well-being of my hedgie."
5,Best Hedgie Book Around,"I've read many books on hedgies in preparation for buying one, and this is the best. We got our little guy from Dawn who has never given us any bad information about raising a happy and healthy hedgehog. She spent a lot of time with us, so we'd have the right hedgie for our family and really knows her stuff. So many books have bad informtion in them. If you're thinking about adding one of these little characters to your family, this is the book to read before doing so."
1,Not so great advice,"The book has a lot of great information but also has a lot of bad information. For example, a wire wheel should NEVER be used for a hedgehog. And pine, aspen, cedar, etc. style bedding is also really bad and can result in a UTI or URI. Aside from that, there is more helpful and correct information than not, just do not use this book as your only point of reference and information."
2,Reader un America,"S-Three Squared is a fantastic novel about life, politics, global economics, global warming, love, religion, and sex in the White House after the Bush Administration. It was slow to hook me, then suddenly I could not lay this book down! Now I can not stop thinking about it and what John P. Turner really did communicate. His take on the death of Ernest Hemingway was most interesting because it really made me re-think the events of the 60s. Turner is a master storyteller who has proven that he can write for men, women, conservatives, and liberals alike. He definitely understands the issues or our federal government bureaucracy."
5,Waylon is Hangin' Tough!,"I've had this album/CD since it came out and listen to it quite frequently. It is good; no matter what the critic from Emap Magazine indicates in his review. I definitely did not perceive it as being pompous, humorless and out of date. Waylon was hangin' tough when he made this recording and still is. A great addition to any Waylon fan's collection."
2,Incovenient to use,"I chose this product because I wanted something that had a microphone (to take cell phone calls) and supports noise-cancellation. Audio quality is good, but the noise-cancellation is so-so. More than everything, the noise-cancellation casing (the rectangular box seen in the picture) makes it very inconvenient to carry around. Because of that, I have not used these ear phones much in the approx 5 months I've had them. I used them only when absolutely necessary, vs. every time I would have otherwise used them."
5,Just as advertised.,This is a discontinued fragrance. Bought it for my fiance for Valentine's Day. It is her favorite. She was very happy. Received it on time. Price was good. No problems.
2,Attraction? Smells more like Repellent!,"Attraction should be called Repellent because I could not get it off fast enough. It's a sweet white floral musk with a prominent vanilla note. A little goes a long way, and it was cloying on me in the dead of winter. I can't imagine wearing it in warmer months."
5,Good Product,"Hi, i bought this for my girlfriend because she loves it and it was great, presentation was very good, the box was in perfect state, everything ok by me."
3,"Useful, educational, a little harsh in tone","New style educational video, there are three modules and these are good for either high school students or young adult vocational students who need to learn about basic domestic money management, investing for retirement and so on. More humorous, more interesting than the more traditional, older videos, on the other hand, the brash, music-video style presentation is sometimes a little grating."
4,An enjoyable time travel,"This book is very easy to read, and one I totally enjoyed because of the feitsy yet intelligent heroine and a nice (if rather bland) hero.I finished the book with no major complaints, only that the 'evil father' character is way over the top. Why can't the hero just move out of the house and live his own life? He is in his mid-30s after all. As it is, he seemed a little of a doormat."
3,I found this book really enjoyable,I got this book out of the school library. The story is about horse named after the title of the book and a man who is a deer culler. The man and the horse become good friends.
5,Used it for 1 month,This product is excellent and I have tried several other brands. I would recommend this to anyone.TX
4,Bosch Quality Continues,"This drill has sufficient power and stamina to get the job done. I used the drill to install rain gutters on a house without recharging the battery. The reason I did not give this drill a 5 star rating is because of its weight. 6 lbs. is heavy for a drill, but the weight is directly related to the quality of the tool. All metal gears, in my opinion, are worth the extra muscle needed to use the drill for extended periods of time. Also, this may not be a huge factor for a professional contractor."
5,Easily the Best Tool in the Garage...,"I'd probably sleep with this thing under my pillow if I could. I love it. I've had it for a couple of years now, and it's still in perfect working condition. The batteries are great too - One of them is just being stored in the garage, as I've never needed to charge it! After more than two years, the first battery is still going strong, and it lasts as long as I need it to between charges.Previously, I had purchased a DeWalt 14.4V cordless. I had that drill for about a week before returning it. I loved it at first, but after a little use, it was obvious that it needed to go back. I exchanged it for another, thinking maybe I just got a bad one, but the second one was just as bad. So I decided to go for the Bosch. Never looked back.I just recently tossed my corded drill -- it was old enough to vote, and it finally decided to quit on me. I won't be getting another one. This Bosch is all I need."
5,EASY WAX,"Meguiar's NXT Tech wax is easier to use than any other wax I've ever used, and it brings back the original color of my 2000 red Honda like no other as well.Buy it, use it, love it!"
5,great stuff,buffed this into the finish of my car after removing hard water stains with the ultimate finishing compound. Great stuff.
4,"Unremarkable, not especially long-lasting","This product is easy to apply, dries quickly, and like most Meguiar's products, smells very nice. It also has mild cleaning properties, so subtle swirl marks will disappear if you apply it with a mechanical buffer. I don't find this wax unusually capable, however. On my black vehicle, the shine it produces is pleasant, though not that deep. I've also found it wears off quickly in a matter of weeks or months, despite that my car is garaged most of the time. It's fine, and probably better than Turtle Wax or whatever else, but I'd prefer not to have to wax as often. Zaino and Duragloss are purported to last much longer."
4,"Good stuff, but keep in mind the following","NXT is probably the easiest wax I've ever used in terms of application and removal. If you take your time, wash and clay your car beforehand, use microfiber towels, and apply an even coat, it comes off extremely easily. The keys there are claying your car and using microfiber. ANY decent wax will be difficult to apply and remove if the surface you're working with hasn't been properly cleaned.NXT works well on my Honda Accord - I've found that it works better on metallics (like mine) as opposed to deeper, darker colors. That said, a common criticism of this product is that shine longevity is a bit short, and I tend to agree. It starts to lose some shine after a week or two. However, I've found that it protects very well, which is more important to me than how long the shine lasts."
5,Great Stuff,"My father and I restore cars as a hobby for friends. I got my father hooked on this wax after we got done with a 1928 Ford pick-up. Black paint after a buff still has a dul look to it, great shine but a dul look. This wax makes paint POP. After a few washes the wax still holds to the paint."
4,Quick and easy with high shine,"After waxing both of our cars with this wax, we were pleasantly surprised by the glossy shine it left. Although previously dedicated carnauba users, this synthetic will be replacing our former brand. As other reviewers noted, it doesn't last as long as some hard waxes. The quick and easy application makes up for that with no problems. Doubling up on coats creates an even deeper shine and longer-lasting protection."
5,Quality wax and very protective of your cars finish,Great car wax. Applies very easily. Go on thin but provides real protection for the finish of your car. I've used it and was very impressed. I will buy it again and highly recommend.
2,Difficult to apply and take off,"After using Meguiar's products for 20 years, I was extremely disappointed with this product. I used it on 2 autos with dark paint and found that when I applied it, it was very difficult to rub out the smears. I had to keep rubbing because they kept returning. This is on a 2008 Scion Xb and also a 1995 GMC pickup. I cannot recommend this product at all unless you use it with an buffer and nice finishing pad. I took another person's advice and used Eagle One's Nanowax and found that it replaced using 2 Meguiar's products to get the same desired results. I'm going to replace my large collection of Meguiars products with the Nano line from Eagle One because I'm that impressed and it was SO EASY to use. Gone were the scratches and swirl marks with only one easy application!"
3,It works but I might be asking for more.,"I read many reviews about this product before I decided to buy it, everybody seems to be happy with this product. Personally I don't think it's that great. I must say that it works on older cars, especially dark coloured paints but when I read ""with a deep wet-look shine"" on the label, I really want a deep water-look shine that looks better than when the car it has water on it. This product works but I don't think is super. I have tried other quick wax products similar to this and it seems that these products work similar, so I might just buy the cheaper product."
2,Not as good as pure carnuba wax,"This product is easy to apply and easy to wipe off. But, on black cars especially, it does not give a nice deep glossy or ""wet look"" shine. It leaves more of a streaky oily finish.I switched over to yellow carnuba wax and the difference was night and day. I have a full bottle that I no longer use and it's just sitting in the garage collecting dust.If you have a black car, and stick with carunba wax instead of synthetics. Meguiar's to make great products, but this one fails to impress.I get a better shine off of Meguiar's cleaner wax than this NXT stuff.But a friend introduced me to Mothers pure carnuba wax and I have since made a switch in brand. I mean the shine you get with this stuff is just insane."
3,Consumer Reports has a great wax review,Consumer Reports recently did a review and ranked this in the middle... their top 2 liquid waxes were by Black Magic and Turtle Wax... and both are readily available for under $7 bottle. They also covered paste and spray waxes. Hope this helps
2,Starts out great...,This wax is very easy to apply and remove and makes the paint really shiny at first BUT....after about 5 days my car is no longer slick and at 10 days the water does not bead off anymore. I have used both the liquid and the paste versions with the same results. Not impressed.
3,Nothing Special,"This wax is just okay. It has easy application and removal. The overall result is good; however, I would prefer a good Carnauba wax. A good wax from Meguiar's or Mothers is much less expensive and will last much longer than this product. I agree with many other people that a car wash or two and you need to reapply. Disappointing."
2,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"Flashy new packaging, a fancy new name, and exuberant claims of futuristic technological advancement can falsely lead many no believe that this is the best wax they have ever used. IT IS NOT. This wax is not half bad, but it is definitely nothing new and not any sort of innovation. Works equally as well as other cheaper brands and WILL NOT remove swirl marks on dark cars just like other cheaper brands.Trust me, your car WILL be 'naked' if you believe everything they claim."
3,Easy,"Not enough time has passed to rate durability, but ease of applying is great, and no residue to speak of is very nice. Shine looks great."
2,good,"this product is good but not outstanding as Barry Meguiar says not last as long as he says I've used both summer and winter and in 6 weeks lost many of its properties. in the real world, not in the world of Barry Meguiar you have to wax the car every month if you want to protect your car. is not true that regardless of price waxes last for many months.since you apply the wax starts to degrade the environment, sun. uv, rain, dust. when you wash you remove the wax inevitably part because dust and pollution and the polluters and stick to the wax and when you remove these contaminants also remove the wax."
4,Pro's and Con's Compared to Meguiar's Gold,"I've used meguiars gold for many years and decided to try out the new tech.Pros:The paint doesn't collect as much dust as with meguiars gold, which is a great benefit.The paint seems just as protected as using the Meguiars gold.Has more of a clean shine to the paint like a new car would.Goes on easy, you dont need as much wax.Cons:Does not fill hairline scratches at all, Meguires gold seems to cover things as it is thicker and builds up.If your car is not new and has scratches or spiderwebbing, you need to use a scratch remover polish first.Conclusion, For new cars this is a perfect wax. For older cars with more blemishes more work is needed before application of this wax. Overall I will continue to use this wax. I won't be throwing out the Gold though, it is still a great wax too."
3,Meguiar's NXT Tech Wax,"I agree with all of the pro's listed above, but this stuff only lasts about six weeks. If you are looking for something with more durability I would look elsewhere."
4,Excellect Product,Best synthetic wax I have used. You have to clean the car good before using with something like ICE clay bar kit from Turtle wax. The shine will be like new and last a long time. I put on on a second coat after the first has been on a couple days and that last a year for me.
3,"Good Book,not great","In ""Cover-up"" Mr. Galanor provides strong evidence for a conspiracy. Yet he doesn't include many key facts of evidence both for and against a conspiracy. Many issues are left undelt with. If you are looking for an introduction into the basis for a conspiracy, this is it. If you are looking for in depth book, don't buy here."
1,Nothing New Here,"Just the same old Warren Commission bashing, but this time illustrated. The author's logic seems to be if the investigators made mistakes (and he is absolutely unforgiving about that) they must have been part of a cover-up and therefore there must have been a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy. But, hold the phone...he's not always totally accurate himself. For example, he implies that the brain, tissue and other matter from JFK's head did not explode mainly to the front, but the Zapruder film clearly shows it did. Also, he's sure there was a conspiracy, but doesn't seem to have a clue who was behind it....is that going to be in a sequel? If so, maybe I can use this book to get a trade in."
1,don't bother,very simple review There is nothing new here. This seems like a conglomeration of everything already printed weather factual or speculative. very disapointing
4,Cabin Air Filter,The product came on time & was easy to install. It was the same product that sold for 50% more retail
4,Historical Perspective of Athens,"The historical perspective of Athens placed this reader within thecontext in which Athens came to be acknowledged as the center of oneof the greatest cultures of the Western world. The author drew thereader to focus upon specific events and individuals because of whichand whom Athens deserves to be reverenced as having once been great.As this reader looks to travel to Athens soon, one is able becauseof this book to approach the city with an historical sense of itsgreatness."
5,Nice Powder,"Smells good, not too strong, feels good, has a nice puff with it. Doesn't over power any other cologne you might wear."
4,One of the best of 2006,"This CD is definitely one of the best I've purchased this year. While you can definitely hear his influences, particularly Sam Cooke, he does have his own sound. I had the chance to hear him live recently in a fairly small venue, & he had the place on fire!! He had a much more raw sound than he does on his CD. I thoroughly enjoyed both, the show & the album."
2,Sam Cooke and Ray Charles he isn't....,"I heard so much about this guy - I had to give him a try. What a disappointment. He basically sings every song the same (retro maybe) but all basically the same. If you want to listen to Sam or Ray - listen to them - they are the ""real deal"" - give this guy the kick out the door - next stop - fakesville!"
1,What???,"I do not know what all of the other reviewers were listening to, but this cd is considerably less the hype. I will not attempt to dissect every song on this cd, so I'll make this short and to the point. First off, think Robert Cray meets Van Morrison in both of their worst moments of song selection and performance. This guy does have a voice, but only glimpses of it appears here. The choice of material is mediocre and severly dated (50'ish). I bought it and thought that the acknowledgement by Van Morrison on the sleeve had to mean something, so maybe I should spend some time with it. After 6 days of listening I realized my first impressions were still valid. So much for Van's praise. If badly done 50's rockabilly/r&b is your balliwick, enjoy. I'll wait for a change in direction before I venture into Mr. James Hunter's bin again."
4,One great musical CD!,"I happened to hear James Hunter live when he and his band opened for Los Lonely Boys in an outdoor concert early this summer in of all places, Brooklyn , NY! I was totally blown away by his voice and the band he had behind him backing him up. I am only giving this CD 4 stars because unlike Los Lonely Boys, James Hunter sounds better to ME in person than he does on CD. I have a fairly modest to expensive two channel rig and believe me, it is well in tune. I can hear all kinds of things on this rig and believe me, he sounds better in person. The music and CD still sound good, but I prefer a live James Hunter. The music is great and well done. I do reccomend it anyway, you won't be disappointed if you like this type of music."
2,Not as engaging as I hoped it would be,"I was hoping on a beat, etc. that would grab me and it just wanst' there. In fact, I pulled the CD out, mid-way, to listen to another CD. I'll have to try it again. Not too impressed with this one though."
3,"Great Voice, Impeccable Delivery, but ......","I guess I fell for all the hype and accolades. Great voice, impeccable delivery and zero originality. At times I felt like I was listening to an outstanding tribute singer with visions of Sam Cooke ringing in my ears. Other times it sounds like circa 1980's Steve Winwood. Most times it just doesn't sound like anything special. I've listened half dozen times and I honestly can't say Mr. Hunter lives up to all this hype. I feel like I've heard it all before. It just does nothing for me. Too sterile, to familiar and just never catches fire despite the obvious vocal skills on display. Maybe it's the songwriting or maybe it's the production. The songs really don't draw you in as anything special. Ultimately, maybe that's the difference between listening to this and a good Van Morrison record."
5,An Absolute Must For Everyone's Library,"Maximum Influence has changed the way I deal with people, not only on a professional level, but socially as well. The 12 Universal Laws Of Persuasion is an absolute must for anyone and everyone. Once you have mastered the tecniques in this book, you will wonder how you ever lived without this knowledge."
4,wow this is amazing,this book has changed me life in the way that i do things. it has made me a more influencial person and as well a better person everyone needs to read this book.
3,Nothing but repackaging of Cialdini's Influence,"It is a decent book, no doubt.I am sure it is legal to copy and paste about 50% of Cialdini's Influence book (examples, sdudies, etc...), because all of them are in public domain. BUT, IMHO, this book is nothing but an attempt to do the remake of a classic (like in movies, you know). Yeah, it reads a little easier, it is more modern and it has Dr. Covey's approval, but I would suggest to read Cialdini's book first and see for yourself.Igor"
4,A good vocabulary book,We really enjoyed this book. My 8 year old read it to me. It is a good introductory science book. I found that it introduced a lot of natural science vocabulary. My son loves The Bears and this was a good book. I would recommend it for grades 1st and below.
4,Memories,"I read and read this book to my own children and I wanted to purchase one for my grandson , 4,who loves to have books read to him. I was sadly disappointed when I learned it was out of print. But the used book I purchased fit the bill just right."
3,Bernstien children's guide to naturalistic philosophy,"I bought the book for a reason. Many parents buy these things because they are cute stories to read to their children. They do not consider the lessons that are subtly introduced to their children's minds. On Pg 10-11 of the book, Nature is described being a number of different things, but then on pg 11 it identifies that ""It's all that IS or WAS or EVER WILL BE!"" Capitol letters are in the original for the emphasis. That is exactly what the late atheist and evolutionist Carl Sagan stated.I bought it so I could show people how the message of atheism can be spread to anyone. I find it very curious that people who think that children should not be taught dogmas (normally this means not teaching children about the God of the Bible) at an early age but should allow them to make up their own minds will approve of this kind of material."
3,Pfaltzgraff Tea Rose MELAMINE Spoon Rest,"I expected the spoon rest to be made of stoneware or some sort of ceramic, however, it is made of melamine (hard plastic). I would have been very disappointed if it had been more expensive, but for the price of $2.25, I'd still say that it's not a bad buy. The spoon rest is pretty; and it's a durable-looking piece for the Tea Rose collector."
2,Pfaltzgraff Tea Rose Spoon Rest,This spoon rest probably will serve its purpose but it is plastic and does not match my set of stoneware as well as if it had been stoneware. I probably would not have purchased it if I had known it was not stoneware.
5,WONDERFUL BOOK,"READ IT COVER TO COVER AS SOON AS I RECEIVED THE BOOK. WELL WRITTEN, IT REALLY TOUCHES MANY NERVES AND HAS SO MUCH FEELING AND TRUTH AS IT RELATES MOTHERS, FEELINGS, AND MOVIES. THE DVD IS ALSO VERY INTERESTING TO WATCH. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL MOMS AND THEIR CHILDREN. I HAVE ALL OF THE JOE GARNER BOOKS NOW, AND THEY ARE A WELCOME ADDITION TO ANY COFFEE TABLE."
3,Not What I Expected,Ms. Kozacek presents a series of well-cued practical exercises. It's just that the workout is too long for my needs (48 minutes). I thought I would be able to select upper or lower body workshouts for alternate days. You are not able to self-select your workouts. Other than that one gets a good workout if you have the time.
3,LONGMAN ADVANCED AMERICAN DICTIONARY,"WHEN I LOOKED IT IN THE WEBB PAGE VIEW, IT WAS MENTIONED "" LOOKS NEW"", BUT WHEN I BOUGHT IT, IT WAS WRITTEN IN SCRIBBLING ON THE SIDE AND TOP OF THE BOOK."
2,Too much hype...,"This album is pure pop. Throughout the entire album Trick Trick makes sure his listeners know how much of a gangster he is, yet none of his songs in a million years would fit the ""gangster"" genre. After listening to the album 3 times, I'm a little disappointed that i only find a few of the songs appealing.""Welcome 2 Detroit"" ft. Eminem, ""Attitude Adjustment"" ft. Jazze Pha, and ""No More to Say"" ft. Eminem and Proof.Corny lyrics, mediocre beats. If you're an Eminem fan or Detroit rap fan, pick it up. If not, save the $10"
5,R.I.P. Dirty Harry Big Proof we will miss you ***Remembered Forever***,I'll give this album 5 * because I like Trick Trick's Raw flavor but I really wanna talk about ProofPeople are Sayin he was the best in D12 - No doubt he was the best in D12 100X better than Bizarre and better than Eminem - But what we all should remember was when he was alive and breathing spittin his rhymes like it was his destiny to rap - To everyone mourning his death I'm right there with you but what we should all remember is when he was alive - Buy this album listen to the lyrics soak it all in and when you have finally remembered every lyric that was said on this record - Go get Promatic and listen to that - Proof just rips it up there with Dogmatic - Then memorize all those lyrics - Just think about Proof up in heaven kickin wit Bugz Pac and Biggie and his relatives who have passed away - Hes probably freestylin his heart out - God Bless You All - R.I.P. Proof -
3,Dubious,"I was kind of sick the day after I took one tablet of this, a severe stomach upset, so I am wondering if the pill did it. And now it's not available? So did they take it off the market? I'm afraid to take another one."
4,Adorable,"I bought the bookbound memory book for my son and i absolutely loved the design and animals on the cover and inside. So when i saw the photo albulm i had to get it, The cover is adorable fabric. The inside has plastic slips and and space on the side to write your memories. The pages are blue i just wish it had pictures of the animals on the inside, like the memory book."
1,Commercial advertising,"This was the most blatant commercial advertising in the form of a book that I have ever seen. I was searching for real information on the immune system to help with my research and this book is 100% about a product they wish you to purchase (ANOTHER COST!). I should have demanded my money back. Originally, it did not say it was about a ""natural substance""."
4,As Advertised,"Before i had this i used a blanket and tried to keep it in place, this is well worth the money. Stays in place very well. It is a little loud when my dog moves around much and she doesn't seem to like to lay on the material, but sure she will get used to it. My only complaint is the holes for the seatbelt (reason for 4 stars). It allows stuff to fall through onto the seat. Other than that no complaints."
5,Perfect for a mid-size car,"We have three large dogs, and their fur just abuses car fabric. This piece is easy to set-up in about 5 minutes, and kept all three off the back seat fabric, all while not sliding everywhere. Highly recommend."
4,happy now for 2yrs,"works as inteneded. Fit is ""good"" not great in a subaru outback XT 2008. needs a better way to hook up under the seat but is acceptable for cost.would buy agian."
3,just ok,"while it is will do, it has many features that should be improved for the comfort and safety of your dog-1. The pictures shows a golden retriever sitting on a flat, no creases cover. Not likely to happen. THe product is not very heavy or thick so it does not stay in place like that.2. The slits for the seatbelts are far too wide and your dog could get its feet stuck in it.3. the smell of the vinyls is toxic! I put it outside for 2 days hoping it would help. horrid!4. Material IS slippery, if your backseat is not even and flat expect your dog to slip esp. if big."
1,Not as promised,"Used this cover in my Toyota Echo for 6 months. The location of the grommets didn't allow me to adjust the straps, which are too long, firmly around my headrests. The elastic supporting the cylinders that tuck behind the seat failed in record time. Water beaded on the surface of the fabric for about a month. The longer this product was used, the worse it looked and performed, until it became a sad, saggy make-do affair. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Flimsy,I have a 40 pound dog and this item aged very quickly. Does not hold up well on the seats. Sides are very flimsy and fold down.
4,quality cover,My dog is getting old and losing some bladder control. Bought this to help and it did. Easy to install and it works very well.
1,Solvit Bench Seat Cover does NOT fit all Cars,"Bench seat cover was advertised to fit all vehicles - could be adjusted to fit. It does NOT fit a 2000 Buick Lesabre - not large enough!! Returning item for partial refund because my ""window"" for return has already closed (?)"
5,Perfect for my new car and my dog,"I just bought a new sedan with leather seats. My 3-year-old corgi has had the run of my old beater since she was a puppy, but that couldn't last with a new car and a human sibling on the way. This fit well, though not perfectly, is easy to take in and out and contained the mud nicely after we got caught in the rain at the dog park the other day. Having the cover has made it really easy to teach her to stay in ""her"" section of the car, just like teaching a dog to stay on a blanket. It washes up nicely too. I've already recommended it to friends. I especially like the slits for seat belts as they allow other people to sit in the back with the dog and it's thin enough that I think I'll be able to get a firefighter-approved car seat install on top. Great purchase."
4,very useful,"I have a German Shepherd who loves traveling in a car. This is the second one I have purchased for both my husband and my cars. It works really well. If you have leather seats in your car, I highly recommend this. I wish I had purchased this earlier enough to protect the leather seats!"
5,a great find,"i searched high and low for the best seat cover for my son's car -- and low and behold,this was it. a great price, for a very very good product !!!!! what he 1st thought was a drawback with it, is actually a good feature -- the dog hair sticks to it. but upon further consideration , that's probably preferable, to the hair flying around in the car, and sticking to carpet, peoples cothing, etc. hope it washes well, when the time comes that it needs it."
3,Not too great for back seats without head rests.,"I got this to protect my back seat for when my Siberian Husky rides along with me. I was really excited to use this, but it didn't fit too great since my vehicle doesn't have head rests in the back seat. I did some adjustments and it stays in place, but it could be better. Also, it seems really slippery, especially during turns!It works for now, I guess."
5,A nice product to help protect you car seats,"I searched for various products available to protect the interior of our vehicle (since we just adopted a new pup) and, after reading the reviews, decided on this one. I was not disappointed! The bench seat cover was easy to install; appears to be well made and heavy duty; and certainly looks like it will serve it's purpose well. Wish that I had known about seat covers when my grandchildren were younger. It would have made clean up after the kids a lot easier. So far, I am very pleased with this purchase."
2,Disappointed,"Seemed like a great idea, and the shipping was fast, the instructions clear. Unfortunately, one of the straps broke the first time my dog got into the backseat, rendering it useless."
3,Solvit waterproof seat cover for pets,I have only used this product for a short period of time but found It to be very slippery. If I am not very careful the dog slips off the seat when I turn a corner or stop. No traction for toenails. It adequately protects the seat and that is what I wanted. It fits the seat well and stays in place. The sound it makes and the slippery surface were unexpected. I am using it. My dog weighs 60 lbs.
4,Saves my leather car seats!,"This does a great job of covering my leather back car seat. Both my husband and I have leather seats and have never had a dog in the car so when we decided to start fostering pups we were very nervous about rips and scratches on the seats. This has done a great job with several dogs, from 30 to 65 lbs (I'm sure larger dogs would be fine too that is just the largest we've had in the car so far). It is so easy after use - just brush off or shake out and everything is like new - the car doesn't smell like a wet dog and doesn't need to be vacuumed! This was thinner than I expected but has done a fine job. My only complaint is that it doesn't quite fit right - it stretches to the edges in one car but doesn't stay up well in the back and in the other car stays up great against the back (because of the headrest spacing) but doesn't reach to the edges of the seat! But that is how it is with a one-size fits all product. Great buy for the price!"
4,Alternate ways to fit,Has nice material though haven't washed as yet so don't know how that will go. My wife is a short person & has removed the back seat headrests so that she can see out the back & the straps are supposed to loop around the headrest poles. Don't know how prevalent that is but we could use some alternate way to attach. Right now I have used some string to tie thru the gromets and have wrapped that around the plastic rings where the headrests should be. So far so good but definitely make do.
2,Changed top straps; no longer adjustable; picture is old model,"See my detailed review regarding the deluxe cover (that got one start due to the huge change in material); only difference is that I am not sure if the material changed too since this was my first purchase of this model and second of the other so could compare; both now have sewn on top straps that fit over head rests whereas old models (year or more) had metal clasps that could be unhooked from the cover and moved along horizontally for a custom fit. Amazon needs to update their pictures on each to match mfg web site and mfg needs to re-instate old product production or loose repeat customers like me. Amazon, which always has great prime service, made it easy to return due to picture discrepancy."
2,Not washable!,"I loved how this worked to protect my seats because my dog shed on the cover rather than the seats. But when I washed it after the first extended use - two weeks on vacation - the backing fell apart! It will still work, but probably won't be water proof. What a disappointment!"
4,Solvit waterproof Bench Seat Cover for Pets Review,"It's perfect now that I had a tailor seal the seatbelt holes. Not sure why one would manfacture cover with holes. My dogs feet and legs would surely end up in them, soil the seats and defeat the purpose of the cover and I would surely never ask my guests to sit atop a dog seat cover. Perfect now. Thanks."
4,does the job,"This works great, and really does what it's intended to do. My only complaints are: the fabric is a bit slippery for our dog, and also that the holes for the seatbelts - which I originally thought were a must - let a lot of dirt and hair through. Really, the holes are unnecessary for us because whenever we have a human in the car, we take off the seat cover anyway. I ended up putting a towel under the holes."
4,Great!!,"I'm used to using sheets or blankets to protect the seats from the dog. After buying my first new car, they just weren't gonna cut it. This works great it stays in place very well, as my dog like to jump all over the backseat. My only complaint is the color choice, But I think that's the only bad thing I can say. A definite must have for a dog, or even children!!!"
5,Excellent seat cover!,A must-have for every big dog owner. I have a 100 lb German Shepherd who has poked holes in the back seat of my truck. This cover has been perfect to prevent that as well as keeping my leather seats clean from when he runs around in the mud at my barn.
4,"A good, simple seat cover","I used this seat cover in an 03 Jetta on a 1100 mile round-trip with a German Shepherd and a Siberian Husky sharing the back seat, and it stayed in place the whole way. That's pretty much all you need to know about this product.It's obviously designed more for SUV's or other larger vehicles with wider, raised seating, but worked well enough to stay where I installed it over an 8 hour drive. It protected the seat from scratches and gratuitous amounts of shedding dog perfectly. My dogs are well adjusted to car rides, and thankfully didn't have any accidents, but it definitely feels like it would be water resistant enough to keep the bulk of it from soaking into the seats, though it would probably leak out the sides and through the seat belt slots.Considering the rest of the seat covers around are twice as much, I really don't see how they could be better enough to justify the cost."
5,Works for me,"It took some work to wrestle this over the back seat of my Nissan Altima, but in the end I prevailed! So far have not taken it off to wash it. It's a bit stiff & slippery for my 60 lb dog's paws, but seems to be keeping the leather seat clean & dry."
3,Better than Nothing,"We have a sedan with black interior, so i was disappointed that this didn't come in black to disguise it more. None the less, it does protect our leather seats from my dog's nails and from the dirt/hair. My two complaints would be 1) i could do without the holes for the seatbelts b/c all of the sand that comes off our dog ends up slipping through the holes and accumulates on our seat underneath and 2) the cover doesn't fit very well (we don't have a place to secure the elastic and clips under the seat, so they just flail around). But it is better than nothing."
4,Love the material,I have a 05' BMW X3....The cover seems to be a little big for the seat but I have dealt with it. I love the material and I love that it does keep my seats clean. I loved the price so over all no complaints.
2,Not designed for Toyota Avalon,"Bought it to replace my broken old dog seat cover.Sadly this one is not well designed. Barely covers the seat from door to door.Also headrests are short so the straps provided slip right off towards the front.The 's' hooks on each side are useless and get caught in the door when closing, so I had to remove them.My other car is a pickup truck so no rear seat there. So I can't use it.Bummer."
3,Excellent quality but moves around quite a bit.,"I purchased this product to protect our seats from the abuse that they get from the dog and the kids. It is top notch quality! We have washed it several times and it looks as good as the day that we received it 6 months ago. It is not the most comfortable to sit on because the material is a little stiff but it surely does it's job in protecting the seats! One of our sons got car sick all over it when we were driving. We just pulled over took the cover off and the moisture did not even soak through! The reason that I give it 3 stars instead of 5 is because it just really doesn't fit that well and moves around more than I would like as the dog/kids get in and out of the vehicle. There is a hook that is intended to tied down each side of the cover, but they always come undone so are pretty much useless."
3,Ho hum,"I guess this is what I can expect for the cost. This is the 2nd seat cover I have ordered for an Accord that is limo to the Chesapeake Bay Retriever. The first was a cheap, quilted cover with felt lining. It slipped around on the leather seats and didn't wash well. This one has been advertised in catalogs and other sites online and appeared to be good quality.It is okay, the piping is cheap, smelly plastic. The fabric seems durable and it doesn't slip much when the dog launches in the car. But the adjustable ties and straps still don't work in my car. I don't have back headrests or much at all to tie off so I had to rig something tacky up. Then the bottom ties/secures were absolutely worthless.So make sure you have headrests and you can get your hand under the back seat or this really won't work. I might be returning it and looking for something more specifically for my car. I don't think it will wash well either."
4,excellent product,This product is well worth the money. It does what it was purchased for and is very durable. It makes keeping the vechile clean very easy.
4,Easy Install,"We just bought a 2012 Ford F150 Crew Cab and bought this for the kids in the backseat. Very impressed by how easy it was to install. A hint for installing in at least this truck...the directions state to ""push the Sta-put devices into the space where the seat back meets the seat bottom cushion."" You can't do that in this truck but it is very easy to instead lift the seat into the upright position, push the Sta-put tube through and then put the seat back down. Do the same procedure for removing them also. The only other thing I noticed was the seat belt slits are spaced just a little short. You really have to stretch to get the second belt to come through and it is tight. If it becomes an issue, this cover was such a great price, I wouldn't have a problem opening up the slits a little more. The cover feels like a nylon material but not rough at all and very thin and light. Will put it to the test with my 5 and 7 yr old boys! So far I'm impressed."
5,Works perfectly,We have a Toyota Sequoia with leather seats and an 85lb yellow lab who loves to ride in the back seat. Wasted a bunch of money trying other products but couldn't be happier than with the Solvit. It was super easy to install and it stays put on the seat. It's a little slippery for the dog but not bad at all. It's worth being a little slippery since it's waterproof. It also has seat belt slits in the perfect spots and is fine when our daughter or others use the back seat. We'd buy it again if we ever need to.
4,It's Great!,"The seat cover works great and is easy to transfer between vehicles. The removable and adjustable straps make fitting different types of seats easy.The material is a bit course, however, and our dog seamed a bit uncomfortable."
4,Great so far...,"I ordered this and two harnesses (which are shipping next week) for my schnauzers. They have been riding in the cargo area of my CR-V and I thought it time for them to be more secure in the backseat. This seat cover is VERY easy to install, I think it took me all of 10 minutes. It fits very well in my CR-V and is made of a sturdy canvas fabric with leather trim. I think this will be a great addition to my leather seats - for the humans and the dogs alike. I can't wait to get my harnesses and see how the dogs fair riding in the backseat. So far the product is EXACTLY as described and VERY easy to install. It gets my seal of approval!"
3,review of oakland athletics flag,"you sent me the wrong flag. I ordered an all green flag with the Oakland Athletics logo on it, but you sent me a green and yellow one that I didn't want. I kept the flag because it's of Oakland and that's all I really wanted but I did want to let you know that I didn't order the one that you sent me. Thanks"
4,Great!,"I have to admit that when I first read this book I didn't like it. I guess I wasn't in the mood for it. But I kept reading everyone's glowing reviews and decided to give it a second try. I was definitely in the mood this time, because I couldn't put it down. I really like Paula Baird Jones' books. The humor, sexual tension, the situations she comes up with... makes for very enjoyable reading. I regret my negative review from before. This time Last Enemy kept me on the edge of my seat. I would highly recommend this to everyone. I have Do Wah Diddy-Die and Byte Me to read and I am looking forward to losing myself in another page turner. I hope the author continues to keep them coming. I put her up there (in my book) with Janet Evanovich and Nancy Bartholomew."
3,Okay,"I would have prefered a few more recipes for the staples such as chicken, beef etc. Most of the recipes seemed a little esoteric to me and unlikely to be included in my every day cooking. Perhaps thats the intention of the book but I think they could have found a better balance."
1,Beware of defective CD player,"I ordered this to use in my son's room, mainly needing the CD player. I used it for a short time when the CD player suddenly stopped working. I returned it and received a new unit. After less than a month, the same thing happened with the replacement. I am in the process of trying to return it and I am moving on to something different in brand and price range. Hopefully the new product will work for more than just a month. Perhaps this is a case of you get what you pay for? Regardless, stay away and buy something that will actually work."
4,sleep facilitation,"The player has good sound, is easy to operate and doesn't take up a lot of room. The seller was cooperative and did exactly what they contracted to do. It all went smoothly. A very good experience for me."
2,CD Player glitch!,CD Player cuts out while CD is playing...Sound so-so...not much basscassette player OK...lousy radio..Not recommended....
2,In the process of replacement,The cassette player started skipping within 3 weeks of purchase;however the people with BuyNow sent me a UPS label to ship it back to them for an exchange and I am waiting for it to be shipped. Iwas very pleased that they responded as fast as they did concerning my complaint. Amazon sent an email like this one to rate my satisfaction. When they learned of my dissatisfaction they got the ball rolling and BuyNow picked it up. So far I've been pleased but need to have the new player before I can say I'm totally satisfied.
4,Portable CD player w/cassette,"Item purchased primarily to use cassettes in tap dance practice sesssions.It has completely fulfilled this purpose. The sound quality and ease of use are quite satisfactory.It is light weight, portable and is easily stored when not in use."
1,wrong cord,The cord did not fit the product. Had to return product due to this. Was a christmas present so did present a problem.
2,Big Disappointment,This was a christmas present for my son.It didn't meet my expectations . It doesn't pick up the fm stations in my area really well.
4,Good product,"This is a good product that arrived as pictured and described. I gave this to my 7 y/o daughter as a holiday gift. I am not certain that she will ever use the cassette function, but it is there if I come across an old tape."
4,good,"The radio arrived in good condition, however the cd player was not working, but my friend was able to fix it."
3,Very good buy,"Its just what I wanted. Plays very well, its easy to operate and the sound is very good"
3,Snowman,I installed Pest Patrol last year and it was fairly easy to use but I found the interface to be lame and the instructions confusing at times. When my subscription expired I tried CounterSpy which detected nearly 200 Spyware/Adware infections immediately after a Pest Patrol scan. CounterSpy also removed several hijacking problems that Pest Patrol did not. The CounterSpy interface is easy to use and understand is way ahead of Pest Patrol in this regard. I also use the free version of Ad-Aware and my PC has been running great. I run XP and have had no problems although I have heard of problems with other OS's.
1,Advised recommendation of the program.,"My previous experience with PestPatrol was unfortunate. There seemed to be no means for resolution to the problem.I have uninstalled the program from my critical system, and installed it on a non-critical system. The update was interminable, but complete with no corruption of files.When run, the program needs some printed guidance for success. After some assumptions as to the requirements, I was able to accomplish a scan and to run the program on an ""active"" basis.I can confidently recommend this program at three stars (although the review system will not permit me to update to that level)."
4,"""Black Tie, Right Noise""","source: www.alternativemalta.comFor a debut EP, Black Tie Dynasty sure have stated their mission: to conquer all territories with their 80's alternative sound. Yes I know every second band are sounding like Joy Division, early U2 and Echo and the Bunnymen these days, but BTD are different. The sound may share some similarities but there is much more to them then that.Chiming melodies scatter themselves across the record's thirty minutes. Add a groovy bass and stadium-sized choruses and you have a band that shows potential, and boy these guys have tons of it.Like I said before this is an excellent debut release and if this is a first step for a band as good as this then I'm sure there will be giant footsteps to follow!"
5,Ms. Miller has done it again!,Riveting book! Holds your attention from first to last page! Looking forward to the next book from Ms. Miller! AWESOME!
3,Different.,"I had a hard time keeping things straight with the reading going back and forth from one century to another. I read it, but was glad when I finished it."
5,HERE AND THEN,OH BOY WANT A BOOK I DID NOT KNOW IF I WOULD LIKE IT I DID NOT I LOVED IT. WAITING FOR MORE TO COME OUT.
3,Had potential but wimped out,"I have enjoyed many of Linda Lael Miller's books but this one (and its predecesor) was weak. While the plot had great potential, she didn't really develop it very much. It read like an ""abridged"" book - just the facts, without many details or character development. Which, to me, made it a lot harder to become involved in the lives of these people or to believe in their responses to the very unusual events that shaped their lives."
1,"Very, very loud.","This time functions pretty well and I like that it sits on a table top.However, this timer rattles. It's extremely loud. It's actually pretty unbearable to sit on a table right next to you."
1,Sylvania tabeltop lamp timer,"I consider myself fairly intelligent. I followed the instructions. I must be doing something wrong, because I set the timing correctly."
4,"Nice ""modern"" Hammered Dulcimer CD","This is a nice easy listeing Hammered Dulcimer CD. There may be a bit more of the other instruments than I would perfer. Other instruments seem to dominate over the Dulcimer at times, but still a nice uplifting ""modern"" hammered dulcimer CD, compared to the typical folk music CD. Glad I bought it."
3,Looks great but...,"Already has a 2-inch rip in the front, not the strongest material...I think the nature of the iron-on is what weakened the material."
2,"Looks good, can't easily get ahold of it!","Very attractive, easily installed, BUT there isn't enough room for your fingers in the recess of the lock side or the other side. My old pull works 10 times more easily."
1,A pull that's Soooo hard to pull,"I got an old chrome pocket door latch that looks like this, but home depot no longer carries the chrome color. After a lot of research I found this. After installing it, it is so HARD to pull !!! So I compare it with my old one and realize the same as another review. The recess is too flat and curved that the fingers can't really ""hook"" on something to pull. I think the design is just wrong to begin with and the quality is also bad. The latching spring inside is so flimsy that it falls off quite easily. I should've spent another 1/2 the prices to return it but, my contractor threw out the package already. :( Guess I'll keep googling."
1,Cheap Offshore Junk,"The old 1960's latch this was replacing was 1000% better. It is difficult to grip the latch to close the door, and it requires a bunch of messing around to get it straight such that the lock works smoothly. Useless, cheap, offshore junk. Into the trash bin."
5,The best,I have had this bag for three years now and it is great. I use it as a cycle bag in the spring/summer/fall and a X-country bag in the winter. It stores everything you could want for both sports. The only bad thing about the design is they should have put the shoulder strap attachments on the outside of the bag compartments verses the inner. At $35.00 it is a true value item.
2,Not for me,"Perfect for a pop up camper. My dual axle trailer would need two of these to work, but dual axle units do no have room to place it in between the tire, it is too long to add a second one between the tires. Using only one will not lift cantilever axles up very much. One axle will raise and leave the other on the ground reducing effectiveness. Using 2x4 or 2x6 stacked wood works best under both tires."
3,Tri-leveler is undersized,We tried our tri-leveler on our pop up camper and were disappointed in its performance. The steps are so small that it is hard to get the tire up there and block it so it won't move when I disconnect the hitch. It wants to roll off. It would probably work best on an RV or a trailer that wasn't going to be disconnected from the tow vehicle.
2,poor design,I do not know what they were thinking when they designed this. The step treads are way to short to hold a tire. A 15 inch tire will not stay on the tread. I have to use 2 wheel chocks one under the other to keep the tire from rolling off the tread. Also each step is to high. I found my trailer was either to high or to low.
3,Not Good for Tandem Axle Trailers,"Quality product and well made. I use the orange squares for leveling and bought two of these, thinking I could just slap them down, drive up, and I'm set. The only problem is that I have a tandem axle trailer and these yellow pads are so long, that they won't fit in the space between the tires. Therefore, you can't get both axles elevated and that doesn't make for good stability. So now the pair are now sitting in my garage on the shelf. Great product for a single axle trailer (more convenient than putting together the orange squares) but not for a dual axle."
5,What a joy,Great item wont slip on asphalt just place them and backup and you done but only thing is if you have dually you need one for each tire other then that wonderful item you wont be sorry you bought them
3,Big & not for snow.,"Very sturdy. Easy to drive up on when in the dirt, cement or gravel. Slides backwards in the snow & we carry large nails to keep it in place in the snow. They are quite large and barely fit into our storage compartment. We had to cut off the handle in back to get it to fit."
4,Maybe it's me....,...but wouldn't one assume these ramps would be sold as PAIRS? They're not. I think the quality is good but I haven't tried it yet.
2,This toy is not for the serious collector or display piece,"Bought this piece as a display item, but found out it is more of a kiddie toy. When the wings are closed, the wings do not line up, give the appearence that the cannons are attached in a crooked fashion.Also, there is no lights or sounds from this toy. The R2 figure is not poseable as other R2s have been in terms of its head or legs. Overall, this toy was a disappointment."
1,What a disappointment!,"We were so excited to be able to give this to our son on Christmas morning. Unfortunately, the box was crushed and had clearly been opened prior to being shipped to us. The pieces were not the original items, and the X-Wing could not be assembled as it was supposed to be. We can only assume that the box had been opened, and pieces had been substituted from the original. The item is now unusable, and given where we live, returning the X-Wing is not an option. Such a disappointment - we will not be ordering from this supplier again."
4,"Hilarious and charming, with a bite","This show is as fun as I remember, with many laugh-out-loud moments, and Sara Rue is a comedic gem and a doll as lead character Claude Casey. Sure, there are some character and plot clichés, but the cast meshes together so hilariously well that I find them easy to overlook. I'm giving this DVD package only 4 stars, though, because there are no extras of any kind, which is a bummer. The order of the episodes on the discs is also a bit out of whack from the original air dates. I honestly didn't even notice this, though, until the final disc; when you get to this one, just make sure the last episode you watch is the season finale, ""The Umbrella."""
4,wrong order,"i was very happy when i heard this was finally released on DVD. And even happier when, despire what's written in the details, it is presented in widescreen format, and not cropped to fullscreen. the only letdown, which i am stunned that no-one else seems to notice: the episodes are in complete random order. i regrettably realized it at the very end, when after the cliffhanger-episode for the first season where claude faces an important decision, there comes yet another episode which has nothing to do with what just happened. and then it became clear to me why in one episode claude has a boyfriend who in the next isn't even mentioned - and why lydia falls in love and then again is cold and alone (this episode ran almost at the end of the season but can be found a lot earlier in this set). i would have liked to see these in the order they were intended. why do things like these keep happening?"
2,Don't double up,"If you already have Leadership Lessons of Jesus (B&H 2002), you don't need this book. Originally Leadership Lessons of Jesus was a two-part book in the Life Works series. I bought both thinking they would be different. This book contains half of what is in the newest edition. Not that great a book."
1,Do not order -- it will never come,"I ordered this item in June when it said, ships in 2-4 weeks. It has since been delayed 3 times and the latest said it ""may"" ship in late Sep. I canceled my order."
1,Anyone can be an expert skier by Harold R. Harb,A really bad book. There's no way anyone can learn to be an expert skier by reading a book. Save your money and take a lesson on the mountains instead.
2,Not like the original.,"My 2002 Pathfinder had one to begin with. It got craked after 5+ years, and I found this cheaper replacement. The original one was held in place with screws. This one is held in place with tape. Seriously.. double stick tape. It gets ""pinched"" down when you close the hood, but nonetheless, I don't have very high expectations for it lasting very long. The plastic is considerably thinner than the original.When this one breaks... and I am sure it will break... I will be going back to the OEM version.It was cheaper the ones from Nissan... but you get what you pay for."
3,"Excellent history, weak understanding","An excellent short history of the Parthenon. Entertaining writing style. But what were the Greeks trying to tell us on this most sculpted temple of Greek antiquity? Like most of the rest of modern classicists and mythologists, Ms. Beard hasn't a clue. It took the artists 15 years to complete the sculptures. They were meant to mean something to us, meant to be understood. For that understanding, I recommend THE PARTHENON CODE: MANKIND'S HISTORY IN MARBLE."
5,"Contexts, Talents, and Cross-fertilization","Richard J. Powell's Black Art and Culture in the 20th Century is fascinating reading for ever type of reader: aficionados of Negritude, lovers of prints, paintings, or sculpture, lovers of cinema and pop culture, students of Caribbean cultures, lovers of contemporary or modern art, and students of African-American history. There is truly something here for everyone. This small paperback book is jammed with illustrations rarely seen. Powell's keen eye and sharp intellect make this a rare treat. Powell approaches his subject from many angles, and we are left inspired to seek more. A fantastic buy."
5,Christmas at our house,"Wonderful!! I first bought this as a cassette many moons ago. Just loved it then, and have been looking for this for a few years. Very happy with my purchase."
1,Barbara Mandrell--Christmas at our house,I ordered this before Xmas at a total price of $8.42...Then got an email that it was out of stock--then after Xmas I look again and found it for $30-35 what gives?
5,Awesome and powerful,"When I first heard this album back in 1984-I was overwhelmed even at 14 yrs old at the amazing vocals of Barbara Mandrell. I grew up listening to Barbara's music. Of all the Christmas music out this is my favorite. I know every song by heart and love to listen to it year round. Have to admit that my most favorite song(s) is without a doubt a tie-""One Night a Year"" and ""Born To Die"". No one else could have sang these songs like Barbara. THIS IS A MUST HAVE"
5,love,My mom loves her and Tammy Wynette and she was sad that the tapes she has of these are getting old and worn so I scoured the internet and found this for her and she was so happy when she got it.
1,Change for no good reason,"This was a promising translation, until the translation team made the decision to remove the word ""Christ"" from the New Testament, and replace it with the equivilant word ""Messiah"". Why? Because they could. Forget 2000 years of history. There was no good reason to change the very word from which Christianty gets it's name, just another attempt to remove the word ""Christ"" from the English Language."
4,Profit Over Journalistic Integrity,"Davis Merritt is a retired reporter and upfront mentions his background and association with the organization he is writing about. In this book he examines the trend of media outlets to dismiss public service obligations in favor of entertaining the public in favor of entertaining the public and profit. He analyzes the 1974 merger of Knight Newspapers and Ridder Publications, Inc., as an example of journalistic decline and discusses consequent broader societal implications. This book is worth reading and should be required reading for all journalism students."
5,This is a phenomenal book,"I have been trading,reading, and writing about futures for 11 years. In my journey I was recommended Ryan Jones's book. In his book he details the various methods of money management, then he exposes their flaws, and finally he presents you with his solution for money management. This is a great book for any student that is serious about his success with futures. Ryan has a friendly approachable style to his writing that engrosses you, even though the information is laden down with statistics and mathematics.It is a nice eye opener to really see how important money management is and how it can work for those that are dedicated and disciplined.Purchasing this book ... will definitely help you keep more money in your pockets."
1,Poor content,I lost my time reading this book. I trade using a much better method that I learned from real traders.
1,Snake Oil Doctor,"Sadly snake oil wins over real value once again. This is very seductive proposition but if you had applied it to real long term systems over the past year you would be BROKE.All of the books in the ""also read this"" list are much better. Go there to preserve your capital."
5,Wish I had this book years ago,"I've read the book a couple times, and feel it is outstanding. I wish I had it available to me when I first began trading futures contracts 8 years ago. Although I was a survivor by my own methods prior to reading the book, Ryan's work has GREATLY helped me to improve results.Although the first edition text has some algebraic errors in equations, it is easily overlooked once you understand and realize the impact of his concepts. Actually, it is helpful; in the sense that his analysis and descriptions are totally correct, and he forced me to review the equations, thus solidifying the concepts he pesents.I have spread-sheeted some of his concepts and use them daily as I trade futures contracts (primarily S&P on 2-minute bars) on an intraday basis.I feel a beginner can gain much help in reading and understanding the text and avoid some of the costly pitfalls in trading."
2,Great explanation of Probability Theory,"Probabilities and statistical chances are great and I use them in my line of work, but when money is on the line I want more then the theory and probabilities of chance making my decisions. . . . This book is better off in the classroom or for someone who enjoys theory and the intellectual challenge of proving the theory correct."
4,DPR2 (Da Players Reveloution for the 2nd time!),"This is an overall good pad. Most people call it a Plastic pad but it is more like a foam (Very clever, the plastic ones break easier) I enjoy this pad. It is a great thing but of course nothing can replace the ignition, and metal pads but the are SOOO expensive so far this is the best ""plastic"" pad you could get but who knows they could come out with an even better Pad like maybe the............ ""Gooey"" type pad????? Ugh it needs a lil work but.... yeah ... Bye!"
2,OK...but not good,"Alright i will start of with the positives, first off this is a dance mat for a ok price, it lights up when you push the arrows and it has an anti sliding foam on the bottom* (*this also helps not that much but does help a little bit). its probably better off to just get the first one. so this is worth the money if you want a lil less sliding and like lights on the top of the mat (the arrows and stuff do not i repeat do not light up."
1,DDR Mat,"We bought Dance Dance Revolution 2 Mat, the kids love it. The quality is great for a bunch of teenagers. It's been durable so far, we have had it for a few months."
1,Disappointed child,"this game pad does not come with any software, and the packaging on the internet does not identify it does not come with software. Our child was deeply disappointed, and the software is now sold out, so the product is unusable.We wish we had not bought the product"
3,Decent...ehhh,this pad is definatly only for beginners I have been playing heavy and challenge for awhile now. This is the pad i started with and in beginning and light it was fine no sign of breaking but after i started playing standard it was nearly impossible ot do well. a pad i recomend is the RedOctane 3.0 ddr pad which has a think material which alows it not to move at all it ranged from 70-120 dollars
2,Not worth the money.,"I bought the wireless version of this pad.From the moment I used it, I noticed it slips a bit. I've almost fallen a few times while using it.The sensors aren't the best. I would hit the right arrow, and it would register as the X button.It doesn't register the faster moves, for example, any 9 or 10 foot songs.I ended up returning it, because I found a better pad at best buy (...)."
2,Worked at first but then...,"I bought 2 mats about 6 months ago. They worked great at first, I really liked them. But about a month ago the back arrow stopped working, so I just used my other. My friends and I stopped competeing and just took turns with the one mat. Now my other mat started having problems with the same back arrow, and its not working. I can see one breaking but two...? How frustrating!!!"
1,Horrible Dance Pad,"I have used many dance pads for many different DDR games. This has to be the worst BY FAR. When stepping on the pad, it sounds like a diaper. Sure the pad has a no slip bottom, but its the top part of the pad you have to worry about. When getting into the faster/harder songs, the top part of the pad will slide on the middle part of the pad, creating a very dangerous circumstance. Eventually the pad will ball up underneath your feet.For light users: 2 stars. The sound it makes when stepping on the pad is unpleasent, but is still useable.For standard useres: 0 stars. Some songs may require you to make fast motions. The pad will slide on itself. Do not use.For heavy users: 0 stars. Very dangerous. Good for lawsuits."
4,PS2 DDR Pad superb,Great response...works every bit as well as the official Sony DDR pad. You can also use the triangle and square button on this pad (something you can not do with the official one). It has a no slip grip and rarely ever slides around. I also prefer the feel of this one to the official Sony one.
3,The Question of Durability,"My friend and I have had experience with both this pad and the Mad Catz. While Mad Catz is a little bigger and does slip around on the carpet a bit, it is a more durable pad then this one. The issue with this one is that after say 80 hours of game time, the internal part starts to slip around INSIDE the pad so that the buttons aren't where they belong and you start to lose scores not because the button doesn't register, but because it has moved since you started the song. They also tend to get stuck sometimes so that the left arrow is continually being pushed regardless. I found Mad Catz offers superior play and it's cheaper."
2,This pad sucks,"Alright, well I've been playing ddr for about 9 months now, I play on heavy and I used to have 2 of these mats, or something similar. These mats work good if you are a begginer and play on begginer or light. If you play on standard or heavy these mats suck. they slide everywhere and bunch up, and after a while the sensors get bad. I have mats with foam inside them, they work just as great and cost 30-40 bucks at toys r us, im tryin to get metal mats but they are really expensive."
5,excellent purchase!,"This DDR pad is a great purchase because it's great for beginners. It works perfectly on any type of floor but I would recommend not using it on carpet because it tends to slip a little. I didn't have any trouble dancing the different difficulties but if you're looking for a durable pad, especially if you have a lot of people trying it, you should buy the more expensive ones. When you fold this pad, make sure you don't crease any of the buttons because I did and I had trouble with one of my arrows. It's fine now, I just don't fold it at all. This game is good for those that are 7 and older. I think everyone should try it because TV is the best place to see how much people desperately need DDR.Overall this is a great work out for anyone and it's lots of fun at a great price. It was worth my money!"
3,Bizarre Pad,This is definitely a middle-of-the-road dance mat. Mine won't lay flat; the corners lift up as though it is attempting to ascend to a higher plane of existence. It also bunches and creases quite easily. Mine came pre-creased during shipping at the top button. The target areas are also not precise; the center area is not a complete safe zone.Choices in dance mats are rather slim now that DDR has dipped in popularity. We mourn the loss of the truly great third party domestic dance mat developers. The bottom line is that this mat is worth the price given the current market. Let's hope this developer improves on its design or offers a superior model.
4,Great guitar and excellent work from B.B. King,"Great blues n' jazz set from B.B. King. His guitar playing is great and vocals are superb. Some of the songs contain a very sublime feel but his guitar and vocal work keeps everything exciting and so does his great backing band. The backing band is excellent espically the horns on the instrumental ""Rainbow Riot"". The xylophone (or something along those lines) work on ""Rainbow Riot"" and ""Teardrops From Eyes"" is very interesting. The saxophone on ""Rainbow Riot"" is incredible and the trumpet on ""Darlin' You Know I Love You"" is also excellent. B.B.'s vocals on shine on trakcs such as ""Darlin' You Know I Love You."" The best guitar is on ""Inflation Blues"", ""Heed My Warning"" and ""I Can't Let You Go."""
4,An essential CD for your B.B. King collection,"Of the dozen or so B.B. King albums I have, this one, for some reason, escaped me and after hearing it at a friend's house, realized I needed this for my own collection. I'm sure glad I did as the more I listen to it, the more I appreciate the difference this particular recording adds to the master's other material. The band seems, if this is at all possible, even more into it and there are so many great individual moments with the various members that one just has to smile and wish you had been there! I really like this recording, highly recommended."
2,La traviata,"Well Allazon and Netrebko are in fine voice but this stark brutal version is not for me. It's more like Traviata by Brecht than by Verdi and what is more there are moments of sheer vulgarity throughout particularly in Act 3. Doing it different, don't make it better. I prefer the version from La Scala with the exquisite Gheorghiu."
1,La Traviata Salzburg,"This is a piece of trash! It's now playing at the Met. Worst Traviata I've ever seen! Not only is the production simply awful, with bare stage, and characters running around all over it, but the singing is atrocious. Only Anna Netrebko is good. Hampson is terrible, sharp most of the time, and the same with Villazon but not quite as bad as Hampson. It is an angry approach to a beautiful opera, and I feel angry that it was presented to me, and even more that the Met has now degraded itself with, as I repeat, this PIECE OF TRASH!"
1,Anna Netrebko's marvelous singing cannot salvage this DVD,"Read R J Beilstein's negative review, ""Willy Decker's Eurotrash Revision of Verdi' Masterpiece""in which he gave this DVD three stars. Except I would give this DVD one star.This is a shame because Anna Netrebko is really superb. I had tears listening to her final aria."
2,Another Traviata for oblivion,"I'll give 4 stars to the singers, 2 stars to stage producers and 0 stars to DG for releasing a Traviata for oblivion. Listen recording companies: what is the point of releasing every other year bunches of Traviatas & Bohemes?...I could name a number of operas waiting to be updated on records (eg Martha, Macbeth, Roberto Devereux, William Tell, Andrea Chenier, etc)...but what do we have instead?...same old stuff!!!. Do you really think the world needs another Traviata?...(some might say, with reason, that recording companies need money and works like this guarantee it...but then, ask yourselves: if money is the only thing that matters, what is left to opera lovers?)"
1,"Villazon good, but Netrebko big disappointment!","Traviata is my favourite Verdi opera and I have gathered at home quite a collection of cds and dvds with some of the greatest Violettas: Callas, Gheorghiu, Sutherland, Moffo, etc. I bought this item based on amazon reviews, but the fact of the matter is that I regret having bought it: I like the tenor and the baritone, but Netrebko did not convince me as Violetta.- act I: her coloratura is barely satisfactory and not what one would expect from a regular singer at the MET...- act II: her Amami Alfredo was weak; she went off tune rather often;- act III: I got no sense of the frailty and tragedy of Violetta - she failed to convince dramatically.So if you are a big fan of Villazon, you may want to buy this dvd for his good Alfredo; but if you are like me and you can't imagine a good La Traviata with a mediocre Violetta, save your money."
5,Fantastic! Mind blowing!,"This is the best ""La Traviata."" I was so moved that I had to take a break. It really touched me deeply!"
5,One of the bests performances of this opera.Is obliged to have,"the performance of the tree singuers that have the key roles,soprano,tenor and bariton is unique,the ebst that I have heard."
4,Novel is better?,"The outstanding aspect of this production is the stark, sparse stage production. In a way it forces the viewer to pay attention only to the music. In my view it does nothing to enhance Verdi's music.The baritone adds nothing to the production. In a way I feel sorry for him since everyone knows of many, previous, stellar performances. The tenor is better suited to ""fluff"", like l'Elisir d' Amore, but he was OK overall. Anna Netrebko is just a jewel. Her presence makes any production a winner.That's just my opinion. George of Denver"
3,Product was defected upon arrival-TWICE,The product was defected upon arrival. The salad bowl's edge was dmaaged in several locations. The box also looked like it has been opened before. I suspect I received a previously returned item from amazon.The product I received was defected but otherwise it looks nice. On the other hand Amazon gets 1 star for shipping me a previously opened damaged item.Returned the item for a replacement.After returning the item for a replacement I got another defected item shipped to me.....Great job Amazon.
1,Terrible Packaging!!!!,"The item itself was lovely and of good quality, the problem was most definitely the poor packaging. The beautiful metal cradle that is included rattled around and dented and even chipped the wooden bowl multiple times. I ordered this product twice even giving the reason for my return of the first salad bowl. The second one I received was packaged even worse. This was very inconvenient since it was to be a Christmas gift. I suspected it the second time so I asked the UPS guy to stay til I looked at the item itself. Lo and behold it was once again damaged and I sent it on its way on the spot. Anyone ordering this product I advise you to do the same! This situation forced me to do what I was trying to avoid, last minute holiday rush traffic jams everywhere shopping!"
5,Results about my 1st internet shopping experience.,The merchandise purchased was to be a wedding shower gift. When I received it I found minor damage and contacted the shipper who requested it's return. The replacement merchandise was in perfect condition and I happily gift wrapped it and forwarded it to the future bride. I have not had an acknowledgement to date and hope that it arrived in good condition. I am totally satisfied with service I received.
5,A great return on your time and money,"Unlike the usual management book that tends to be littered with success/failure anecdotes and little else, this book gives solid business advice that can provide immediate and worthwhile guidance. So whether you have just set out on your managerial career or are a member of the gray-haired 'been around the block a few times' executive club, Creating and Dominating New Markets will provide a great return on your investment - time and money."
1,A collection of dates,Very poor account of the life of a genius. Lots of details but very disappointing from the point of view of the development of the ideas and the technology. You will end this book knowing in detail what happened during the transfer of the penemunde team to america but not knowing that rockets don't have propellers.
5,¡Muy interesante!,"Este libro a pesar de su tamaño, contiene valiosa información para quien desee saber mas acerca de aperturas de ajedrez. Por supuesto, deja muchas líneas sin cubrir, pero ello debido a su objetivo de ser una guía rápida, fantástica para el principiante. Sugiero que si quedan dudas acerca de alguna línea, se consulten otras fuentes (libros, programas de ajedrez, bases de datos), y se pregunte a personas con mayor conociemiento de estas líneas. Es interesante que este libro sea valioso por ello, pues provoca curiosidad por saber más de cierta línea y motiva la investigación."
5,An Awesome New Writer,"Ann Cummins is fantastic! I read the title story in McSweeney's and then flipped when I found out about this collection. Her stories, mostly concerning working class folk, are both tender and brutal. the OilCan highly recommends"
4,A glowing marvel in desert sands,"The first story in this collection, ""Red Ant House"" is an absolute gem. It captures the two little girls' world with starling accuracy and childlike candor. ""Trapeze"" and ""Crazy Yellow"" are also standouts, excellent and fascinating.Many of the stories in this collection are coming-of-age tales with a child or teenage protagonist growing up in an atmosphere of poverty, boredom and loneliness where the child's imagination provides an escape from everyday reality. The stories are primarily set in desert towns in the American Southwest. At times, Cummins' writing is so effective you can practically feel the blazing sun and blowing sand."
4,Pretty rough going for the lay person,"While this book has an incredible amount of information in it, the writing style makes it pretty slow and difficult reading. The fact that each chapter is written by a different author means there's a lot of overlap between chapters, especially in the introductory part of each chapter. (I assume they did this so each chapter could be read independently.) Also, the language is strickly academic: always use the most technical term, never use one word when four or five can be used.A very valuable resource, but not meant to be read from cover to cover as I tried to do."
5,History and Literature,"This book is excellent. It will change your life. The writers explore the fine line between history and literature. It is enlightening to explore the role of the literary persona as it applies to world scriptures. Greek, Roman, Persian, Jewish and Christian authors have all created fascinating characters who speak with ""divine authority"" which more readily might be translated as ""poetic licence"". This is especially interesting as it applies to political regimes who legitimize their power with the aid of prophets and seers. In a world where superstition still reigns, in both science and religion, this book might help bring back the rule of reason and common sense. A book both atheists and believers will enjoy."
2,Lot's of informantion but not creatively written !!!!!,"This book is very informative but slow,because of the writting style this book should not be read from cover to cover but more as a reference. The writting of this is as if the author/authors were giving you the information,without attempting to make it interesting or an enjoyable reading even thought the information in this book is a must have I would not recomend this book for an enjoyable reading on Bible history"
3,Good but Deep,"I gave this book a three-star rating, not because it was inferior, but because it told me more than I wanted to know. There was much more here than I needed to know for my puposes. I enjoyed it but I did not appreciate it all. If you are a lover of ancient history with a talent for detail, you might give this book a four or five star rating. It is well written and well researched. Students of history and the Bible will probably find it up to academic standards."
2,Buyer Beware,"Buyer beware. The chapter on the time of Jesus reads like an op-ed piece, not a history book. The author of it is Amy-Jill Levine, who describes herself on her website as a ""Yankee Jewish feminist . . . with a commitment to eliminating anti-Jewish, sexist, and homophobic theologies."" If you are a Christian looking for a neutral, scholarly source of information, keep looking."
1,Water! I need water!,"This has got to be one of the two or three most boring books I have ever read. The prose is so dry that reading a single page left me feeling like I just crossed 100 miles of desert without water. After a few hundred pages I quit the long, tortuous journey.I would have hoped, indeed expected, that a general history of the biblical world would have been at least readable, if not thoroughly entertaining: the bible, after all, represents a fascinating time and place in human history. Somehow, the authors, with their deadly dull academic drivel, managed to convert the telling of this history into the most potent somniferous soporific I have ever encountered. Indeed, the reading of it should be dispensed only with a doctor's prescription."
3,The Oxford History of the Biblical World,"I must admit that my expectation was for greater accuracy to proper verbage than was printed. Much of the time the authors used location names, like 'Palistine', when referencing 'BC' (BCE) rather than the true name 'Isreal.' Small verbal goofs like this was unexpected from an institution like the Oxford press. Most of the information, though, was excellent, and informative."
4,Almost Untold Story,"Back when comics were trendy for all of -what- five minutes, this story was commisioned by Fleetway for either Crisis or Revolver and - having been reviewed and reluctantly OK'd by the legal team - became 'banned' when the printer refused to print the material...About a year later, Skin finally surfaced and - while the notoriety perhaps helped raise interest - it stands as a great example of a well written, well crafted comic for a mature audiance.Not as fun as Shade, nor as clever as Enigma, and not the mental kaliedaskope of the (sadly unavailable) Rogan Gosh - Skin still is well worth your time and attention...."
4,"Nice Strap for the Price, but...","This strap is comfortable and has a nice look, but if you are going to use it for an electric guitar you might want to go for a strap that is a little wider around the shoulder. I ended up using it for one of my acoustic guitars instead of the electric I bought it for because it doesn't really hold up to the weight of your average electric."
4,Physics Well Explained,Physics is well explained in this book and easily grasped with problems and tests. The only negative is the fact that some formulas are not proven.
4,Good book to introduce you to basic Physics,"This book is for someone just starting to learn the basics of Physics. I bought it for my son to have at home to study for tests, in the event his notes weren't thorough enough."
2,Could have been much better,"My main problem with this book is that the answers are stated directly below the exercises, forcing you to either try to cover up the answers with a bookmark or sheet of paper, or consciously try to not look at the answers, which is distracting. This format makes the book feel more like a trivia quiz than a book about a serious academic subject. Though the book throws some rudimentary equations at the reader, it doesn't explain them clearly enough. Overall, I felt the whole idea of the book was to rush the reader through the subject matter rather than giving the reader a meaningful knowledge of the fundamentals of physics. This book initially appealed to me because it was cheap, but trust me, you're better off paying the premium for a real textbook."
5,A Good Start,"This book is a great place to start for anyone wanting to learn the basics of Newtonian physics. I decided to read this book in preparation for my high school's Physics AP class that I'll be taking next year. Comparing this book to an outline of the course, I found that the book covers more topics than the class, but in less detail. Like I said, it's great for the basics, but that's about it. The approach is rather non-mathematical, but very clear and easy to understand. Kuhn has done a great job of making basic physics understandable. This book, in conjunction with a study text, such as Schaum's Beginning Physics I or a textbook, would be an ideal way to learn physics on your own."
1,Misleading,"It supposed to be teaching physics not measuring systems. When studying the ideas in this book it, the book is no different from what you will here in public schools, 2 yrs colleges and 4yr colleges.Instead of explaining the concept of acceleration the book gives the exact dinefinition of ecceleration. Giving the exact definition of an idea instead explaining the concept of the idea leaves the student confused and lost."
5,Loved the book,"Gary Kadet's Book is like a breath of fresh air. His scene players are so life like, there had to be alot of research that went into the writing of this book. I loved the fact that there were no Painful lags, like most D/s books have. Gary's humor is a thing of beauty. I plan to tell everyone I see, to go out and buy the book."
1,Two Thumbs Down,"I give this book two thumbs down. I only wish I had more thumbs.This is a very poor showing, even for a first time author. No warmth, littly sensuality, and almost no real plot. The author substitutes hubris for humor and folly for feeling.You follow the life of Perry Patetick, a submissive framed for murder and out for revenge. Revenge is the one thing Perry seems to do well, because he seems incapable of any emotions other than hate or anger."
1,Front Row Seat to Madness,"Enter the world of Perry Patetick, a man so sick he projects his own failings onto everyone else, rather than deal with his own wounded psyche. For example, instead of seeing the honestly caring relationship between O and Tutor, he imagines that it is somehow a diseased situation. Perry just cannot deal with the fact that everyone else seems to have found love, but all he has ever found is hate and anger-- both within and from without.This book would have been an interesting charachter study of delusion and psychosis, but unfortunately it was written so poorly as to render it painfully unreadable."
2,Flippancy Does Not An Engaging Novel Make,"I wanted to like this book because I'd heard positive things about it, also because it supposedly treated BDSM in a realistic & intelligent fashion. Unfortunately, this is one of those books whose characters are immediately annoying & the narrator's voice is hopelessly flippant and arrogant. One third of the way into it and I was hoping the main character Perry would end up with a ball gag in his mouth and his hands chained somewhere far from his typewriter keys. Alas, it wasn't to be. This book may be breaking new ground, joining the mystery genre with that of erotic fiction, but it just doesn't read very well."
1,Notes From The Underground Meets Amateur Hour,"The author succeeds in creating an untrustworthy narrator who reads like a true psycho. However, the plot is thin, the characters one-dimensional lampoons, and the writing simply terribly, painfully bad. For example, during a scene in a mall foodcourt, the author writes, ""... the conversation laced with sexual innuendo blurred my hearing."" I did a quick internet search, and found exactly two references to ""blurred hearing,"" both of these being for a rock band out of Baja, Californina. In other words, I was correct in my assessment: Kadet mixes metaphors like a cement truck in an earthquake. If you're looking for good BDSM-related fiction, I suggest you stick with the professionals like Cecelia Tan, John Warren, and Anne Rampling. Even for the work of an amateur, this book leaves much to be desired."
1,Amateurish at best,"Not much here except a disjointed and poorly written jumble of mixed metaphors and amateurish puns. No plot, no story, no humanity, no sensuality, no fun to read at all."
2,Fairly shabby performance...,"Here's a not-very-good novelistic treatment of the s/m scene. As an s/m scene player myself, I found very little here that rings true, and as a reader of crime fiction, I found weak characters, a middling plot and a total lack of psychological depth. For me the worst aspect was the social satire; I found it less pithy than pitiful. I will give the author a point or two for daring to grapple with the so-called sexual underground, though his notion of ""decadence"" is fairly tame. Half a cheer and hopes for a better performance in the future."
1,Not Very Punny,"Perry Patetick adopts the ""Scene Name"" Propertius. It's simply one lame and amateurish pun after another in this cliched and slow-paced melodrama.For those who don't know, the name ""Perry Patetick"" is a pun on the word """"Peripatetic"" which means ""walking around,"" or ""being like Aristotle."" And trust me, Perry is no Aristotle. What Perry sees as walking around being an observer of truth is misleading, because Perry sees everything through eyes clouded by his own past abuse, and his own evil personae.This is deffinitely not a worthwhile addition to any bookshelf."
1,D/s isn't any good,"Poor Katerina gets killed and Perry Patetick is blamed. So Perry does what Perry knows best-- sets out for revenge.Perry has only two emotional drives at work in his head: lust and anger. Perry is a sick and twisted creature incapable of love, compassion, or empathy. In short, Perry is a Sociopath and completely unlikable-- and he's supposed to be the HERO of the book!As unlikable as Perry is, the book is even worse. Boring, contrived, and poorly crafted best describe this mediocre treatment of what COULD have been an interesting story."
1,Profoundly Bad,"Characters like Tutor and Bootlicker seemed to have been brought forth by the author for no other reason than to make fun of them. None of the characters had an back-story, or any real motivation other than their ""fetish.""Even the main character, Perry Patetick, was hardly developed. Did Perry have any brothers or sisters? What was his relationship with his parents like? We never know. These things are important when developing a character, and the author has missed this completely.So when Bennie frames Perry for killing Karenina, there is a seed of doubt in our minds-- was Perry really framed, or did he actually commit the murder, but forget he did it in his madness? Perry's madness is the one thing the author seems to have grasped well, but Perry sees himself as a leader among men, which is ludicrous to the reader.A slow, painful, read this book was. I say skip it."
1,Not a drop for this book,"Oh, how can I possibly express how much I hated this book. If this book were lost in the dessert, dying of thirst, I would not give it a drink. That is how much I hated this book.Bennie kills his cheating wife and frames Propertius. Propertius seeks revenge. The plot seems an afterthought wedged in between character studies of Deprav-O and Bootlicker. Shallow, denegrating, and uninsightful character studies."
1,unlikable,"The book is a little painful to read. Kadet cannot keep a conversation flowing smoothly. I can't understand how Mr. Kadet expects to take a character as unlikable as Perry Patetick and then expect us to feel sorry for him when he is framed for murder. The only characters we feel sorry for are the likes of Bootlicker, Tutor, and O, because of the way they are mistreated by the so-called ""hero."" I even feel sorry for poor cuckolded Bernie. But these characters are never fully developed, which is a shame because they might have turned out to be interesting.Kadet is a poor observer of human nature and cultural absurdities, and this novel only serves to highlight these shortcomings. Anyway, there are some funny characthers and situations, but Gary S. Kadet is unable to make a complicated plot easy to follow.I did not enjoy ""D/s"", and if Mr. Kadet writes another novel, I am deffinitely going to steer clear."
1,D/s = Disjointed Slop,This book was not so much written as applied with a trowel. Layer upon layer of diatribes and contrivances serve as a foundation to support what little plot or story there is.
1,A disapointing failure,"D/s is a failure as a a book about sadism and sex. The author brings us into a psychotic's life at the brink of a mental collapse. It is a poorly written and contrived journey into madness where he finds illusion and delusion. It is a pathetically poorly written, insensitive, unromantic and boring mish-mash with an ending that will neither surprise nor entertain the reader."
1,Embarassing,"An embarassing debut for any author. I hated every poorly written page of this mess.The only thing worse than this book would have to be the life of its hero, Perry Patetick. Perry is a sociopath without most of the emotions that make us human. He gets framed for murder, and seeks revenge. Apparently, this revenge involves spending a lot of time in internet chat rooms, and the transcripts are included in this book. Not exactly a real treat."
1,Hogwash,We're supposed to believe that Perry Patetick was in love with Karenina before she was murdered. Hogwash! Perry Patetick is a sociopath incapable of such feelings. The author fails to come to grips with the fact that the character he has created is an evil monster gripped by hate and intent on doing harm to all around him.The author has also failed to come to grip with the fact that the English language has certain rules and structures that help one effectively communicate.
1,Kadet is no John Warren,"There are a few acknowledged leaders in the genre that Kadet is seeking entry into. John Warren, Jay Weisman, Cecelia Tan, Anne Rice, and Laura Reese. Kadet is no John Warren. His characters lack any real sense of depth or motivation.Propertius (also known as Perry Patetick) is the only character we really get to know well at all. Deprav-O is ammusing, Lady Pain is interesting, but neither are fully developed. Perry, on the other hand, gives us a deep look into his madness, and you will not like what you see inside him. You won't like what you see in this book at all. It is stunningly poorly written."
1,Beyond Redemption,"Kadet has succeeded in making a character (Perry Patetick) so twisted, he makes Darth Vader look like Mother Theresa. At least in the end, Darth Vader found redemption. Perry Patetick is beyond redemption. He is all-consumed by hate and revenge. Add to this a meandering plot and a strange narrative structure, and you have a story that is sure to disapoint."
1,Not even entertaining,"D/s is chocked full of violence. The main character, Perry Patetick, is ruled primarily by impulses of hate, anger and revenge.Interestingly enough, the author's world is characterized by nearly everybody but Perry being sexual deviants and villians. It isn't until later that you discover this worldview is an artifact of Perry Patetick's own sikness.""D/s"" is classic pulp fiction. It is excessively violent, very poorly written, and has some form of sex act at least every 4 pages. It is assinine in it presumptions about society and simplistic in its assumptions of human nature. Ironicaly, it is just the kind of book to appeal to the ignorant masses that are so despised by the hero of the book.""D/s"" is not good literature, and is not even entertaining, not even in an excessively violent, sexualy perverted and moronic kind of way."
5,Simply Great!,"So, you take the big step, change your life, for the better it seems. You're happy, caught up in the new excitement you have found, the new love, the new life. You're heady and giddy and the world seems to be spinning on its axis at an incredible speed. This is how Perry feels, the main character of ""D/s"", this is how he wants to feel forever. But of course, nothing lasts forever, as Perry finds out all too soon.Following Perry's journey is in and of itself thrilling. Gary S. Kadet has a way with words such that you can feel Perry's joy, feel his excitement, and yes, feel his pain.D/s is an incredible first novel, one not to be missed. Keep up the wonderful writing! I'll be looking for more from Mr. Kadet!"
5,Gotta Love It!,"And I did! A superb first offering by Gary S. Kadet, D/s is chock full of human entanglements, humor, insight and of course, fetish! The power of kink is explored in true to life form, the BDSM scenes leaving me breathless, the book over all too soon. You just gotta love it!"
1,Painfully Bad,"If you've ever seen an animal that has been fatally and horrifically wounded, then you know the feeling of looking into the psyche of Perry Patetick.Perry has been wounded by his past trauma, and rather than seek love or redemption, he seeks retribution and revenge towards all around him. In his paranoid world, everyone he sees is a malevolent figure. And when he loses his one true love, Katerina, he goes over the edge into complete madness.Watching Perry decompensate is almost as unbearably painful as trying to decipher the authors ridiculously poor writing."
5,A Literary Masterpiece Yet To Be Fully Recognized,"This is NOT a fetish or sex book, but rather a potent, reality-based yet superbly imagined metaphorical examination of modern life and Death over sex (or D/S!).I liked what Playboy's fiction editor Alice Turner said -- someone who not only knows her oats but good literature. She's also the author of a scholarly volume on Hell that's of interest. To wit:""Gary S. Kadet has an authoritarian air - thorough research - and his semi-ironic take throughout is that kinky, painful sex is both ridiculous and fun... This sizeable novel leisurely investigates the oddities of fetishism.""- Alice Turner, fiction editor, PlayboyThis book is a revelation -- subtle, demanding, everything good books should be."
1,Nothing to see here... please disperse,"Call it an anti-love story, but please do not call it a mystery. Don't even call it a crime drama. Call it a melodrama set against the background of a seedy BDSM underground as narrated by a sociopathic main character. And please, don't call it literature. Literature this is not. It reads like a dimestore novel after someone turned a thesaurus program loose upon it.Towards the end of this long and painful read, the author throws in a ""murder mystery"" of sorts. Perry Patetick (supposedly his real name) has an affair with Karenina Pashlust (also supposedly her real name). One has to wonder: Where is Ben Dover or Dick Hertz? Or for that matter, Ford Prefect or Arthur Dent?Anyway, to get back to the ""plot,"" Karenina's husband kills her and frames poor, psychopathic Perry. Perry gets mad (again-- Perry spends the whole novel mad at everyone about everything) and embarks on an unholy crusade of revenge).I absolutely hated this novel. There is nothing to see here."
1,Anaerobic and Stifling,"D/s is an amateurish, bland blend of mudanity and tedium that put me right to sleep and would have knocked me into a coma if it weren't so laughably poorly written. Mr. Kadet is obviously a mediocre writer -- he has created a profoundly bad, tacky, and anaerobic book."
1,"Oh, The Humanity!","Tangled in purple prose and mixed metaphors, this work simply burns in its own moorings.Not since the Hindenberg has something this big and unweildy gone down so utterly in flames. This book crashes, burns, and explodes. Poor writing, convoluted exposition, and a total lack of regard for internal consistency contribute to the demise of this gas-filled behemoth."
1,Beautiful Home Recording and Beautiful Mediocrity,"Jen Rathbun indeed has a wonderful voice and her chops are sharp to the bone. Unfortunatly, the engineering quality is unable to capture her talant. The same tone of her instrument is throught out this CD. There is no character in different instrument orintations. The lack of musical colors marks this effort as so,so. I am not sure what her purpose is but if you really, really, like background noise you will love this CD. I give it 2 ""Mediocrity's!"
2,Beatiful Day,Jen Rathbun has a powerful voice and great piano charm. Her live performances are very entertaining. This is great lounge music! What seems to be missing is diversity of her piano and lyrical efforts. I give it 2 stars.
2,Mood Muzak,"There seems to be nothing here to stir the senses with ""Beautiful Day"". The recording ability should be questioned. The inability to capture an original style is aloof. I'm am not sure what this artist is projecting as far as style. I give it 2 stars for effort."
1,Go back to school,"I can't knock anyone for trying, but this is the biggest bag of NOTHING I've heard in some time. Too many great singers and musicians floating around to even consider this as competitive material. What a joke!"
1,Beatiful Day???,"""Beautiful Day"" is a disaster from the start! When stomaching this CD the listener is taken on a ""Merry-Go-Round"" trip. My nine year old daughter discribes this CD in four words ""May I be excused?"" There are no definite issues or direction in this CD. Nor is there anything that will sooth or rock! 1 Star at the most here guys."
4,Something Different,"Don't confuse this CD with Jen's previous home studio CDRs, this is a full fledged studio CD. The liner notes say recorded at White Cat Studios, mixed at Studio in the Heights, and mastered at Terra Nova in Austin. It's the real deal! In addition to Jen, there's also other Texas artists lending their talents to the effort, so it's quite different than you've heard before.This CD won't appeal to everyone. It's not the usual top 40 'formula' music. However, if you're looking for something different in your music listening, this is something you need to hear."
1,Blatherskite Day!,"To make a long story short? I would highly recommend to wait until this artist has a fourth or fifth attempt at a musical career! Save your money!!! I give it 1 star. Moslty for the effort in printing this ""Muzak""."
1,Beautiful Parody,"Jen Rathbun has such a great voice and her understanding of the piano is almost flawless. The problem is that she is unable to package these ideas into something that anyone can listen to for more than 90 seconds. This is like a train wreck, you may have a difficult time listening to this unless you are throwing a neerbeer party in Utah. Really boring music here people. You have to give Jen Rathbun credit for have the ability to play the piano and sing. Other than that, if you enjoy boring passages with tolerable transitions, you will love this CD."
5,A Great New Artist!,"What a great find! A new artist who can sing, write and play. The CD provides an incredible variety of music from a fun song about cereal to the deeper emotions involved in life changes - and all delivered by a strong, flexible voice. It's also nice to hear some intelligent, thougt-provoking lyrics. I highly recommend this CD to mature music lovers."
2,flimsy,"i had gpx products as a child and always found them durable and well made, but the unit feels cheap to the touch, like very thin plastic, and the unit appears bigger in the picture. it has absolutely no bass output. i got it for my child as a first boombox, and it serves the purpose, but for the price, shipping, and the wait, spend the extra 10 dollars and go for something just a little better."
3,BETTER THAN NOTHING,"It works fine, speakers are OK. Was fairly inexpensive and came with an mp3 player line in. that was nice. Otherwise like I said earlier it works ok."
5,It's exactly what it said it would be,"This works great. Needed a small CD/Radio/Aux music player and this works perfectly. Seems a little light (cheaply made), but has worked great so far (after a month). For the price it was what we needed. It's not too big and having the buttons on the front allows us to leave on a shelf and easily access the buttons. came with an aux cable as well."
1,CHEAP,This radio is cheap. the sound sucks and it breaks after a year or so dont bother buying this cheap thing.
2,Speakers for show!!,"The appearance is deceiving, one would think by seeing the huge speakers on the front you would get a monster sound. In,a large space the sound is easily lost around the hum of power tools or hammer. What I first believed to be a good value turned out to be worth exactly what I paid for it. And as everyone knows you get what you pay for!!!!"
3,Not too bad,It is what it is. Not the worst but not the best. Crackles when you turn it up to loud and it makes a faint hum that you can hear through the speakers when it is in use.
1,GPX Not worth $1 dollar,"Just bought this ""radio"" at a local dealer. Can't wait to return it. It does not pick up the FM stations I want and when it does pick up an FM station, it sounds like it is broadcasting from a tin can. And I mostly listen to talk radio (NPR, Public radio, NOT Limbaugh and his ilk)! Already back in the box for return. So here I am on Amazon looking for a decent FM radio...I don't need any bells and whistles, CD player etc., just broadcast FM radio with decent sound. Not to be had with this radio, save your time and effort and spend a bit more."
1,CD never worked!,"Bought this early summer and the remote only works for the CD after getting the item. I wanted a remote for the radio as well, just assumed since my last one purchased over 15 years ago did. Then I went to use the CD player several months later after purchase and the laser must have burnt out from being in the sun because the CD player (which still had a cardboard CD inside!) was still in the device but cannot get the CD player to work. My fault, I should have run a full device check! Now I know to really read the descriptions and test everything but I just wanted to get out into the sun and listen to the radio..."
1,Worst one I ever had,"I ordered this on Aug 29. By Dec 5 it would no longer play cds. It would just spin without playing anything. And if it did start to play the cd, it would stop after about 60 seconds. The return policy said I could return it only up until Oct 25 for a full refund, but after 3 months, I would have to pay to return it, pay to have a new one sent, and get only a partial refund. That would be financially ridiculous for a $30 item. So, it goes into the garbage and I highly recommend almost any alternative product."
2,Nice appearance but faulty performance,"The sound is tinny. For the price, one does not expect great sound, but this player's is sub-par.The CD player is unreliable. It often requires restarting, and frequently stops after playing part of the first track.It is the epitome of the adage, ""You get what you pay for"". If it wasn't so much trouble for so little net back, I'd return it."
1,Wasted Money,"I bought 2 of these and gave one to a friend. They're not worth the money spent. The most irritating thing about them is that the radio tuning dial and the digital numbers do not move at the same time, making it very difficult to land on the station you want. Next, the scan buttons do not work. If all you want to do with this is play cd's go for it. Otherwise, find a different player for the money."
4,"I really, really like them! Ideal for visually impaired people.","Front-loading CD players with tactile controls are quite hard to find, and this fits the bill. There are 3 different sized oval buttons on each side, with 3 or 5 tactile dots on each. It's very easy to run in low light or with low vision.I have taken a star because of a problem with durability; I have 3 of them, and, so far, one has had to be returned under warranty. GPX has been helpful with that, and, while I wish it hadn't happened, I'm still fond enough of the machine to stay with them. I don't use the remote and haven't unpacked any of them, so I can't say anything about that."
1,Horrible and cheap,"I wasnt looking for great or quality sound, just something decent, the sound on this has no bass at all. Reminds me of when i was 8 years old in the 80s and my Mom got me a crap radio. Those speakers they sell in the [...] store to hook up to your MP3 player have better sound quality than this.. [...]"
1,I should have read these reviews first,I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend of mine and I bought it in haste. I will purchase another gift for him and he'll just keep this because he lives 1500 miles away from me. He says that it has no bass and a very poor sound quality.
2,very bad sound,The player is a cheap dissapointment. Very tinny sound. It also skips sometimes. Not worth it. It has a very bad sound.
2,You get what you pay for........,"This is a decent radio if you want to bring it to the beach or someplace where you would not want a high dollar radio stolen, but the sound really is not that great. I would not expect top shelf sound for $21 but it should be a little better than this. Not a horrible product, but not really worth it."
1,Don't waste yor time with this item,"I had to give a 1 star review because zero was not an option. Product arrived very fast and was packaged well but it was DOA. The CD player would not work, it would not read any CD's right out of the box. I called the 800 customer serv # and was asked to get a cd cleaner and and clean the laser and if that did not fix it to return it. UPS delivered it yesterday and I sent it back today. Very cheap knobs and cheaply made overall. The radio did work but did not sound very well at higher volume, it would be good for maybe a nursery where the music is not loud."
2,Great Customer Service for such a small item,"Second time was the charm; as the first order got lost in the mail.and, Amazon was quick to respond, replace, via next day shipping, at no cost to me.Merry Christmas, NOT if you give this product; although it sturdily built and all features look top of the line; the sound is poor and weak. All Treble; NO Bass, at all!This is such a good looking item; but the sound is like that you would get from a child's radio. Tried several CD's that have heavy bass; NOTTA bit! This unit has NO Bass in it. No tone adjustment; just a generic sound, annoying sound.Definitely not as advertised; nothing quality about the sound; we'll see how much I have to pay for return shipping; as it's definitely going back!"
1,Spend a little more and get something decent,"We got this item for our kitchen specifically because it has a 3.5mm input we could plug our smart phones into. Whenever the aux cable is plugged in the unit makes a low humming noise that is very irritating, sometimes it hums even when the aux cable isn't plugged in. To make the noise stop we have to actually leave the unit unplugged. FM reception is also pretty poor.Overall there is nothing good about this unit besides the price. Save up a few more bucks and get something decent"
1,Bad Bad Bad,Not even worth $25. Gets static even playing CD's. I returned it to amazon. Amazon service as always 5 stars. But this Radio is junk! Don't waste your money!
3,Depends on what you use it for.,"I enjoy the fact I can plug my iPhone into the player to amplify the sound of my favorite podcasts. I never noticed a lack in sound quality like other users have. The only real issue I have with this player is when I put a CD in the CD player I have to shake the thing to get it to work. (Seriously, other people having this issue, you should try this.) Whenever I put a disc in the player I will tilt the whole player towards myself until I see (on the digital display) the unit has accepted the disc. This is not particularly fun to do- but I'm the one that cheaped-out on a CD player and I guess I'm paying for it now."
2,Poor sound quality.,"The sound from my cd's is tinny and poor quality. The radio is fine, it is justthe cd playback that is terrible."
2,Poor Sound,Doesn't sound very well. The fact that it has the line in is pretty cool. But what do you expect for $30.00.
3,Not as fancy as it looks.,"This radio looks a lot fancier in the picture. It's very hard to get radio stations to come in on it since it is a turn dial, not a digital button. It does the job for my 6 yr old daughter, but if it was for me, I would look for something better."
2,Not the best purchase off of Amazon I've ever made,"I believe the item was used. It was thrown together in the packaging and was missing the battery lid on the remote.The AM frequency went out. That was the main reason for buying the unit - to listen to AM radio.The old adage is true...if you buy cheap, you get cheap."
2,"All looks, nothing else.","Even at that price, it's not really worth it. Sound is tinny at best, and the tuner sucks. The CD player works great, but the sound from the unit is, at best, terrible. Not worth the time it takes to order it from Amazon. Sorry!"
2,It may have been a good product If...,"I was looking for a simple device with a remote control such as this one. I was thrilled when I received it. It was somehow difficult to get one in Ireland/Europe.As I was quite busy I only opened n checked it 3 days before use (16.02.11)Bid disappointment. Not mentionning the plug. Not suitable for Europe as it is design for Usa where the power is only 110V.So I do not rate this device according to its intrinsic performances but according to its inadequacy to my need.Batteries( cooper zinc) bought at the grocery store did not last long on Cd player, much longer on radio though.Probably, for fair review, the seller should provide a warning and even better the possibility to get an adaptator when it comes to international shipments."
2,There are better out there!,"We purchased this for our 8-year-old son for Christmas; he has a sansa MP3 player and we burn a lot of music to CD's for him, as well, so we thought it would be a good unit for him to play both; the remote was a total bonus (or so we thought)!This unit plays CD's just fine, which is the only ""pro"", as far as I'm concerned! There is a buzzing sound when the unit is not switched off, and even then if we leave the AUX line plugged into the unit, the buzzing continues until it is unplugged. The remote control is pretty basic--just controls the CD player, but it doesn't even reach from my son's bed to his dresser--which would be about a 5 foot distance! The radio doesn't fine-tune--it's analog with a digital display--that doesn't bother me if we could get it to tune correctly!I know it's not very expensive, but I think there has to be better out there for the same price!! I would move on to another unit if I were you--this one was very disappointing!"
1,Don't Buy this,"I bought this unit and got it home, when I started a cd, it sounds so flat. The sound quality is very very bad. I took it back immediatly."
4,Nice Buy,I recently purchased this cd player and it works great. The sound quality is excellent. The remote is a great added touch!
3,Good Basic CD Player,"I got this CD Player for my wife for Christmas who needed a basic CD am/fm radio player. This has an extra, you can plug your mp3 player into it. It seems to work good so far.For the price I'm pleased. It's not a sony or a magnavox, and I was a little dissapointed because it does seem a little generic as far as quality. But you get what you pay for and I didn't want to pay 69 bucks. SO for 29 bucks I got a good little player that seems to work well. Understanding that 90 percent of the components in most audio devices like this one are made by one or two big names, I'm hoping the quality is as good as a brand name and that it will last. I guess we'll see."
3,Don't get it for the remote.,"This was supposed to be a gift of sorts but didn't really work out. The only reason I got this was because of the remote, but it hardly works and is poorly designed like it was an afterthought.If you are just looking for a cheap, nice looking boom box this thing is not bad at all, and it's nice that it has an aux input for a mp3 player or whatever else.If, like me, you are looking for something with a remote do not get this."
2,Hums whenever plugged in,"This was fine on sound, but there was an awful humming constantly. The volume would cover some of it when turned up loud, but otherwise, if it was plugged in, it was humming."
2,Cheap. You get what yo pay for....,I guess you get what you pay for. It was only supposed to be used for CD playing for a child. The cd player stopped working after 4 months. Get something better for a couple of dollars extra.
1,cd player,dont like it because the sound is tinny. Am going to return it. The price is right but sound is bad
3,ok for a cheap cd player,"I bought this cd player to play a white niose cd for my baby. It works just fine for that. However, when playing a music cd the soung quality is not great. But it's about what I expected for the price."
1,"AVOID THIS - Cheap, tinny sound and lasted barely a year","I bought this because it would fit on the shelf space available in my house and it would take input from an MP3 player.I discovered thata) the sound quality is poor, even compared to other ""cheap"" players. I usually can't tell any difference between good and bad players, but even I could hear how tinny the music sounded.b) any sort of vibration will make the player skip or throw up an error and stop working -- like even heavy walking in the next room sometimes.c) it lasted just over a year and then it stopped playing CDs (which was what I primarily used it for). My old ""cheap"" player lasted 8 years before dying, so this was pretty pathetic in comparison.So unless you only need this for the short term and don't care about sound... AVOID IT. There are much better players out there for the same price."
2,Not even worth the low price,"The sound quality is complete crap. There is absolutely NO bass and when you try to turn up the volume the speakers crackle and cut out. I was excited about this radio because it is mp3 ready and came with the jack to connect my mp3 player. When I connected my mp3 player I was shocked to discover that the sound quality could get even worse than it already was. I actually like the design and I guess since I will be using it in my office at low volume it will serve its purpose, but I still wish I wouldnt have wasted what little money this costs."
2,not that good,"I see amazon has since changed the display picture, when i ordered it they had something completly different, cause if i knew it looked like this I would have never bought it. Anyway, the sound quality is bad, it's sounds like an old transistor radio especially when the sound is turned up. I can never get any radio reception on it so I guess it's not good in that regard either. I had to end up giving this to my 3 yr old son to play his cd's and buy a better one, i cause for that price i should not have expected much."
2,Horrible sound,"I thought at least the cd sound would be balanced. Nope. Very high on treble, and the remote that comes with it, does not adjust volume...just backwards and forwards for song selection. Looks nice...sounds yucky,"
3,"Good for kids, lousy for adults","My two year old son loves to play music and I've been going through CD players trying to find one that didn't eat batteries for breakfast (naturally I don't want to use the AC power cord for a toddler's toy). I also wanted something generally kid friendly (easy to take CD in and out, not too heavy, not too complicated, good build quality). This player fit the bill perfectly. Not that it last very long on batteries but I get 2-3 days on six rechargeable C-cell batteries vs. 8-12 hour on the two previous CD players. The sound quality isn't very good and I can't imagine an adult would want to use this for music."
1,i wish u would have told me the condition and packed it better,ti was in no condition close to the pitcher nore is it the same typ of compurer shown.it was packed in a box sidwayse with stirephome inside the computer and screws missing and in the rong places the cd drive was smashed in as well id i wanted to be riped off id buy stuff off ebay
4,B-MOVIE CLASSIC,"the only reason i watched the movie was because my cousin was in it(the kid in lobby w/ the switch blade)but after watching it i got into the tale of the white insurance guy stuck in the projects with no way out..you will have to watch it to see what this man goes thru..but if you look closely you will see a young stacey dash, kadeem hardisson and a couple of others..i really hope this movie gets a remake or goes on dvd soon...great to add in that dvd collection.."
3,BE WARNED!!!,Item was listed as a 'collectible' and I'm sorry to say it is far from it i.e. damaged box with bad cover and/or touch ups. I'm very disappointed...not worth the price stated ($39).SMH...
2,Misleading Title,"Expecting a video on cruising to and from Alaska, I was disappointed to learn that approximately 25% of the video time was spent on the cruise journey and experience, while the remaining 75% was a travel documentary on a variety of sights and excursions in Alaska, namely train rides, helicopter, planes, and even whitewater rafting adventures. The scenery was of course quite beautiful, but the choreography was equivalent to that of which we were once forced to watch in high school, dry and ""documentary"" styled."
4,fast paced,"fast paced game, enjoyed the customize options you have for the mechs. will keep me playing it for a time."
3,Armored Core 4 Personal Review,This is an excellent high action game. The controls are hard to get perfect for all you have to do but its well worth it.
2,Difficult to imagine any human getting pleasure from this game,"This is a game I would have expected to play on Super NES or Sega back in the 90's.The worlds are like playing inside of a poorly drawn AutoCAD drawing, with a noticable lack of detail.The game play will not ""draw you in"", unless you are drawn in by frustration and repetiveness. I've played the game for hours trying to figure out why they made it in the first place...and I can hoenstly say I still don't know why the large robots are fighting to begin with...poor story set-up.Since it's #4 I assume there are 3 other ones out there. If you liked those don't let me get in the way of you liking this one, if this is your thing. But, there are so many other games out there that a person will actually have fun playing why waste time on this half-effort with too many menus and options to go through."
2,wait a second....,Ok I'm not going to write an in depth review (only played game for 30minutes) just here to write some things I think the other reviewers overlooked.... in-graphics are a joke! For majority of the game I felt like I playing a ps2 title.... its 2010 and I am playing an xbox360 with 1080p output... seriously graphics are a joke in this game? (BUT do note:the cinematic intro to this game is amazing though!) The in-game menus are eh.... and story mode (for the 5 missions I played) is boring since AI is horrible.... they don't move or anything just stand and shoot.... I played this game for 30 minutes and it was a bday present to myself.... a very horrible present to say the least.....
4,AC4 the mechs are back,"Sega & SOFTWARE team up to bring us the latest addition to the Armored Core series with Armored Core 4. With this latest addition we are introduced back into the world of mechs. This Armored Core game stands out among the others as with a simpler mech building process, which i am very happy about because this is one of my favorite aspects of the game, you get to design your mech with parts , weapons, colors & emblems before heading out to battle other mechs in the field both online & offline.The only downfall I see to this game is it is still keeping with the short missions, so for those who do not have online capabilities it leaves them to a repeation of gameplay. The graphics with this Amored Core game are more crisp, giving the enviroment a more sleek appeal. If you enjoy a good Mech or battle game then Armored Core 4 is a definite game you should pick up."
5,The man with one ell of a story to tell,"He truly is remarkable. Terry is definitely the greatest known, unknown artist to steal the spotlight. I am not going to even bother yapping on, because I could go on all day. I will let the several people here that actually read the booklet inform you of Terry's accomplishments. If you are new to this you might want to check out Glastonbury Fayre. I think that is spelled correctly. He shows you just what he's worth. I didn't even know that that was Alan White (future Yes drummer), and David Lindley playing the pedal Steele sounding like a fiddle. Not to mention Fairport Convention plays on the film after Reid (who is first) and Traffic closes after Melanie Safka.This record is definitely one to buy two copies. One to mount and one to play.I have to buy this one again. I got it for twenty-five bucks at a record store a WHILE back. The tornado just took my last copy. :("
2,Would not reccomend,"Had one that worked well for over 3 years. Just bought this one in April and stopped working in May, I am now returning it."
3,Ending,I thought the book was terrific--carefully researched and written. One of my students was disappointed in the ending and thought he would have give the book 4 stars with a different ending.
5,Conflict and non-conflict:..Each is within us,"It often appears that conflict is the norm and that there's no way to avoid it. We see this in our personal lives and in the entire world around us. We see it on TV and in the movies. We hear it in a lot of popular songs. We read about it in the newspapers.However, there is an alternative to all this lying within each individual. Careful reading of Gary Simmons' book should help one understand the how and why of this conflict, and how to embrace, rather than resist, it and thus learn the effective way to deal with it.This isn't Pollyana stuff. The author teaches martial arts, and his teaching comes from strength, not from timidity and passiveness.For those who are super serious in their desire to deal effectively with conflict, I recommend buying the tape EMBRACE TIGER, RETURN TO MOUNTAIN, along with this book. However, if you're not ready for that, than go for the book itself."
5,Heartfelt,"This is our study book at Unity of Bellevue. It is chock full of beauty, insights, and helpful exercises. Recommend this book."
3,Lots of good ideas for the right people...,"Difficult for me to write this review because I wasn't touched, moved or inspired by it.. And... I think the right reader would be."
4,I of the Storm,The I of the Storm is a wonderful look at where conflict fits in our life and how to embrace it is a positive way. The Author uses excellent examples and powerful illustrations to help us put in perspective our own challenges and in doing so transform a negative experience into a positive outcome. I would very much recommend this book.
5,2007 GMC SIERRA,"great product, i used blocks as a lift with a rancho keveling kit on the front gave the truck a nice stance. for better ride you will need longer rear shocks or ride will be stiff because of shocks being stretched a few more inches."
4,"Nice compilation, but...","...where are the major hits 'Heaven must be missing an angel' and 'Don't take away the music'? A 2CD anthology at the price of almost 21$ should include these great songs! Nevertheless, all the included songs are really great, making this Tavares album a competitive choice!Chris"
4,TV turntable,The product finally arrived in tact on Feb 16 - over a month since the order. I really like the appearance as well as I did when I ordered it - it is true to the pictures. It is very attractive and quite sturdy. The only problem - the base is much larger than I anticipated. I either didn't notice the measurements or they weren't advertised - not really certain which is right.
1,Not very clear...,Benjamin's Shadow of the Object is filled with philosophical and psychoanalytic jargon that leaves one with the impression of being distracted from the absence of cogent argumentation. Not recommended.
2,Not useful to pass exams beyond high school level,"After reading so much about Dominic O'Brien, his achievements, and his books, I had great expectations about this book. Currently I am pursuing a career in Medicine, which has tough board exams; and I was hoping that this book would provide me with good advice and good techniques to improve my memory and be able to retain important information.In my opinion, this book has no use if your academic level is beyond High School. Learning to memorize a list and to ""crack"" a chemical code serves no purpose to me. The tips on how to speed read, mind mapping, and how to take notes were covered in a speedy and superficial manner.If you want a better and more detailed information about this memory techniques, save a few bucks and get them for free at this web site [...]"
2,southwestern five tier table,It's not that great! The wood looks cheap but it is quite sturdy and I use it for a collection of small ceramics. And it's small - the picture is deceiving.
3,Not what I expected,"I purchased this Love Knots toasting set and Cake Knives hoping it would be a perfect fit for my fiance and my personality. Its a bit more modern and the crystal is surprisingly heavy!! The quality of the glass excellent, but I would suggest you check this out in a store prior to purchaasing. I was hoping to personalize my glasses, but the crystal is sooooo narrow, it would only look appropriate to use an initial instead of our first names. I'm sending back due to the fact that its too narrow and doesn't seem to hold as much fluid as your ""classic toasting flutes"" I guess I'm more of a traditional bride than I thought. The quality was great but just a bit too simplistic for my taste. Good Luck on your search ladies!!!"
5,Beautiful,I was so very pleased with these glasses. I gave them to my future daughter-in-law and son as a shower gift and they just loved them. Will get them engraved with their names and wedding date.
4,very interesting illustrations and cute simplicity,"Simple for the very young, cute illustrations, maybe a little to crazy though, hard to stay focused on the objects in some pictures, but still very creative."
2,A Forgettable Counting Book,"Usborne comes out with a number of good board books, but this one is pretty forgettable. Each page features a number, with an accompanying animal, brightly drawn in a style consistent with a six-year-old's artistic ability. The animals are friendly-looking, but I prefer artwork to raise the standards of readers rather than conforming to their own abilities. Baby may enjoy paging through by himself, but won't learn the numbers since this cognitive ability comes later than you want him to be reading this."
4,Great deal,This book was in good shape when I received it. It was a great deal. I received the book later than I expected that was the only problem.
3,Symphonically Dramatic...for sure,"The Rimsky-Korsakov schooled Respighi composed this early threemovement work in 1914. It is a massive piece for large orchestraand expanded battery of percussion. Eclectic in style, it consists of elements of Mahler and Debussy(especially in the 2nd.move.)and a touch of R. Strauss with occassional orchestral effects. The dramatic mood carries consistently throughout, and the last few bars of the finale seem almost lavishly Hollywood inspired. What is lacking is a memorable theme, that made his ""Pines and Fountaines of Rome"" so great. So, this overall is a good work, decently performed, lacking a bit in detail from the engineers, half the price of it's only competitor. An inexpensive way to round out your Respighi collection."
3,Too expansively written and performed,"A Respighi symphony? A rare, unappreciated find, you might think. Not so. There's a reason you've never heard this symphony, and probably never will in concert. Several composers' influences are heard, to the point of making it derivitive. The ""drama"" contained in this symphony is stretched too thin. Material that would have made a good 15 minute tone poem is stretched out into a 58 minute symphony. To make the drama work here requires a tight, dynamic performance, accentuating what energy is here to be had. This performance doesn't do that. This is a straightforward, adequate performance that never tries to inject the needed juice. Fantastic engineering, though. If you're a die-hard Respighi fan, I could approve of this as a performance to buy. But if you're merely curious, I don't think your curiosity will be rewarded."
4,The Hardy Boys In London,"The Hardy Boys are in London visiting their friend Jax, who has just perfected a tiny radio transceiver capable of being fitted into a tooth! When a mysterious fire occurs at an exhibit Jax was working on in the Tower Of London, authorities are suspicious of him. Later, Frank, Joe and Jax are attacked and finally the invention is stolen from a hidden wall safe! Frank and Joe track down the clues which seemingly involves a Russian spy and solve the mystery is a twist ending."
2,"Satisfactory burner, horrible software","Decent hardware I suppose, but do look elsewhere for burning software - Sony CD Extreme is a very flawed CD creation program with minimal features and sometimes burns music at the wrong speed and corrupts data files, not to mention it's stability and compatibility issues.If you can get the CD burner at a decent price, go for it, but look into Nero, CDex or Easy CD Creator for putting together your CD-Rs."
5,a good product,this product is worth the money it costs. it is fast for writing cd's and it is reliable.
3,very sticky breast binder,"This is a very sticky breast binder, you get to have patience to deal with this otherwise it serves it's porpouse, the price though could be lower since it's not a very good material It gets deteriorated right away since is so sticky the velcro sticks A LOT to the fabric."
4,Faucet Repair,"Danco 28957 Trim Kit for MOEN Single-Handle Tub and Shower Faucet with Flat Plate, ChromeUpdated the bathroom with beautiful new chrome without the expense and bother of replacing the entire shower assembly. The parts came in a flash. Were very easy to install and now it all looks brand new again."
5,"My tea rose collection, from Amazon.com!","I have the burner covers, 1 large crock, and 1 smaller kitchen utinsel crock, and the spoon rest, of the tea rose pattern, on top of my stove, and they look beautiful, and I love them! They make my stove look eligent! Bought the burner covers and the spoon rest from Amazon, and my Daughter gave me the 2 crocks!"
1,it is a total disapointment,"I disapointed with version of Masterpiece Theather. It is not funny movie. It looks more like a bad soup opera. The movei should be about a boy and his family, however movie is about every charachter's frustrations. The charm of the Darrell's book is completely gone and all scenes filled with shirt vein, insulting dialoges between characters. If you want to see a good version of Darrell's book get a priviouse movie produced in 1989 on VHS."
4,Finally sounds of winds,If you love the sounds of the wind through grass or through trees this cd has what your looking for. Not every track are wind sounds but there are a few that have nice soothing sounds to sleep with.
2,WAS DISAPPOINTED,"I was very disappointed in this book. The book contained more about the programs that the aircraft had in the development stage but not much information on the actual flying performance. While the authors spent more time on the political ramblings that ultimately killed the program but didn't expose any of B-70's flying qualities or pilot reports. They did cover the accident involving the second prototype and the F-104 quite well. The parts break down and diagrams as well as pictures were excellent, however."
3,The best of 3 minimal books,"As a book dedicated to such an historic aircraft there is surprisingly little information about the aircraft. There's lots of writing about the history surrounding the aircraft's development and political struggles, but almost no information about what the aircraft actually did (and couldn't do). The author spends a lot of pages blaming politicians for the cancellation of the aircraft without discussing it's significant technical problems. Compared to what is now available regarding the SR-71, the story of the XB-70 has yet to be thoroughly recounted."
2,Lightweight fare,"I was very disappointed with this book, especially given the authors' backgrounds. Some good photos and background info. I was hoping for interviews and input from parties directly involved in the XB-70 program, but there were none.I *really* wanted to like this book, but it was only the merest hint of what it could have been."
3,Shoulda been a good book...,"Ho-hum. Only a few good photos. Fairly thorough but boring. Except for air-to-air radio transmissions during The Crash, not much excitement for an awesome airplane."
1,Buyer beware,"I was so excited to give this to my grandson for Christmas, Unfortunately, it does not work. It gets 1 Spanish station on the am dial and nothing at all on any fm stations. Don't waste your money on this."
4,Pushes all my buttons,"Solidly good scifi book. Pushes all my buttons, nuclear rocket engines, aliens, wise-cracking protagonists, Mars, great character development, etc, etc.I wish the sequel, _Threshold_, was out in MMPB but not until next May.Can I hate on the cover ? I did not buy this book for over a year because I saw the dinosaurs and plane on the cover and thought that this was a time travel book. Wrong !"
2,Boring!,"This is sci-fi? I was really expecting a great novel, especially with the ""discovery"" in chapter one, but it is glossed over. ""There will be problems"" but nothing about the excitement of discovery. Chapters jump months, the characters hover between one-dimensional and none and the pacing is poor.If you want a great Flint novel, try Time Spike, where he gets it right."
4,DAVID IN GEORGIA SHOULD STAY THERE,"20+YEARS OF SI-FI AND THIS IS A WAY COOL BOOK! WILL READ MORE,CRISP/NOT DOG'ED AND LOOK BETWEEN! FUN!"
2,Great concept ruined by boring exposition,"Based on the cover art and concept (one star each), I bought this book against the recommendation of a friend who had read other works by the authors. I should have listened. Flint and Spoor have developed a potent antibiotic for the germ of a great idea. The story grinds out slowly with an interesting bit hidden in every other chapter or so. As others have mentioned, there are too many banal characters introduced and blandly fleshed out. The only way the book builds anticipation is to bore you to tears waiting for something, ANYTHING, remotely interesting to happen. Midway through I finally gave up and began skipping chapters and then skimming every other page for a possible good part. I found it was like a soap opera where you could miss a few days and still keep up with the plot. Unfortunately, this soap opera cost me almost $20."
3,senior reader,if you expect action you will be disapointed. i was totally bored til 3/4 of the book was read then a teaser and it was down hill from there. i collect science fiction and love action and dinosaurs but this had nothing to encourage me to keep the book for my collection. it will go to the resale store. this was rated as a 4 or 5 star on amazon so i purchased it at the science book club. glad i only paid 50 cents for it. the author had more fun throwing in technical junk and initials for science jargon which spoils the whole story. the only dinosaurs are a pile of bones and a stuffed one at the end. nothing between. i give it a 3 for the cover art.
3,Multimedia <> Sound,"Although the title of the book indicates that it is about multimedia, it is almost entirely about sound. Animations receive hardly any mention. I was disappointed by the book for that reason."
3,Useful for portion control as well as attractive,"I like using these. I make all my favorite foods in them as it helps with portion control. They are attractive to serve from freezer to microwave or oven to table. I will note, however that food takes a much longer time to microwave than plain glass. Great for making leftovers attractive for the next go-round!"
4,Intriguing book from amazon,"The reason I bought this book from Amazon is that one of my classmates who was murdered is in this book. It is very interesting seeing other cases in this book also. Author does not seem to be as detailed as I would like, though. Overall, a good book."
2,More Magic Please,"I love Lois Duncan books but this one falls short of the rest. The plot was okay but I didn't like Nancy at all. And I think in order to enjoy the book, you should enjoy the main character. I thought the characters weren't that well developed. What I did like was how it didn't only focus on Nancy (thank God) but also on Brendon and Kirby. I wouldn't recommend this Lois Duncan novel."
4,"This book ""raises da roof""","hi viewers!wus up? I totally recomend this book to readers who like suspence, mystery,revenge etc. It was a suspenceful book the kept you wondering waht was gonna happen next.Lois Duncan writes with great detail. If you have read"" I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and thought it ruled, you'll love this book........ I think..."
3,The Gift of Magic,"I thought that this book was very good in description and in detail. I think that this book covered the advantages and disadvantages in having this power. I think she delt with it well and deserved to have it all work out. I thought that in some places the story kind of dragged on, but that didn't happen too much. I think that this book was very good and interesting in some places and rather boring in other places. I think children that enjoy a realistic fiction would like this book, but also those who like just plain and simple magic. I think that Lois Duncan did a good job of writing this book. All of her books are wonderful in their suspense and mystery. I believe that this is one of her many good novels and should have more like it.Go Lancers!!!"
1,am I the only person who doesn't like Lois Duncan?,"What? This book was BORING! What was the deal with the boat thing, all it did was fill up a bunch of pages. I found myself skimming the end and most of the book. If Lois Duncan would have at least put some suspence in the book then it might have been good.the beginning was good, well, the first five pages. . . the rest of the book was horrible. The worst book that I had ever read!Another problem in the book is that everyone was so polite, the little brother kept on saying ""For rat's sakes,"" now that's what i call unrealistic. That leads to another problem with the book. . . the writing was very very very bad! Some sentences didn't even make sence, it was all just drivel.If you ask me, don't read this book!!"
3,Stephen's Review,"This story could be a lot more interesting, if they wanted it to be. I think this book is better for female readers because it is emotional and sensative."
5,A Gift Of Magic,"I am a thirty six year old mother and grandmother who first read A Gift Of Magic when I was thirteen. I loved the book then, and never forgot it, it made such an impression on me that I wanted to find it again! So, I looked it up and found it still in print! It truly reflects artistry and a gift of storytelling. I now have a daughter who is seven and want to share this wonderful story with her. It is encouraging and inspiring, will make any reader believe....in Magic."
4,Truely Magical!,This is the first book I've read by Lois Duncan and I must say I really enjoyed it. She is a great author who puts in a lot of details to her work. My favorite character was Nancy. She was different from Kirby and Brendon in a way that is hard to explain. She didn't want her special gift unlike Kirby who loved hers and Brendon who didn't seem to care either way. This book is great for all ages and I definietly recommend it to those who believe in magic.
1,A Gift of Magic,"Though normally a fan of Louis Duncan, ""A Gift Of Magic"" dissapointed me. The story seemed to drag on for ever, with no specific plot or planned path. Her characters seemed emotionless, and I felt no connection to them at all, the way I normaly do when I'm reading. It was only vaguely descriptive and the dialogue was dry. I didn't feel like I was learning anything more about Nancy's gift, only that she wished to keep it hidden from others besides her family. I kept reading, knowing that Duncan normally writes half of the book before getting into the plot, only to be thoroughly bored up until the very last page, where I was surprised only by the final sentence."
4,A Gift Of Magic,"A gift of magic is a about a very nice mother and her three extraordinary three children. Nancy,the middle child of the three, can read minds,know their thoughts,and make anyone do anything. Brendon,the youngest of the three, has the gift of music. Kirby, the oldest of the three, has the gift of dance.I think this is a four star book because it goes from exciting to sad and then back again. I like when a book can do a complete mood swing. If you are the person that likes books that can totally change moods in one second then you will like this book. If you like books that are boring and dumb and only have one mood throughout the book then fine don't read this book."
5,Thrilled to discover this book is still in print!!!,"I can still remember reading this book in the 5th grade. That was in 1975. I read it at school as part of a personalized reading program. I never forgot the story and wanted to pass it on to my niece, however, I couldn't remember the full title or author of the book. I searched for it for years. Unexpectedly, I found a reading log in an old box a month ago. The book was listed in the log along with my notes. I was ecstatic! I immediately got onto Amazon and discovered it was still in print. I just ordered it and can't wait to read it again!"
