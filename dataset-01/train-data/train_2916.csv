4,Extremely informative and exhaustive,"This is a great resource for die-hard Nightmare fans. The doc is filled with obscure behind-the-scenes details and stories about not only the movies, but the comics, the books, and even the Freddy's Nightmares TV series! My only regret is that there isn't more discussion on the ""meaning"" of the films; most of the info seems to be the behind-the-scenes stories. The Nightmare Series encyclopedia on the boxed DVD set of all the films does have some on the meaning of the films and the characters, and the special edition infinifilm DVD of the first movie has some great documentaries on dreams and the meanings thereof. Everything taken together, it works out pretty well! This is definitely worth getting ASAP for a Freddy fan. Very good stuff."
5,Elm Street,Not crazy about this Movie - but my Son is - which is the reason I purchased it for him for Christmas - He is a big Freddy Kruger Fan -
5,"For those of you who like Freddy Kruger, you'll love this DVD, and if you don't then there's somethin rong with you.","this DVD, and if you don't then there's somethin rong with you. My only complaint realy has nothin to do with the DVDs themselvs, but with the sleave the box comes in. It's a grate one the only proboblm is, is it seems one of those britel one's. Insted of the strag cardbord kind, but I've got no complain about the DVDs themselves. You'll love those, and like I said before if you don't then there's a probolem with you."
5,Awesome Documentary,"In my opinion this move was as indepth as you could get with a documentary about some 30 years of film. Each movie had a VERY long segment, most enjoyable was ""Nightmare 2"". It brought to the forefront a lot of memories of things I didn't even realize or understand as a kid.If you are a fan of this series or a person that just wants the low down of everyone's favorite boogeyman on elm street. This is for you. Enjoy."
5,Amazing!,"This doc is amazing for the nightmare fan. As a hardcore fan I loved this, and even with a four hour running time I wanted more. Even the casual fan will find a lot of interesting stuff here. While the original film has been covered over and over on previous DVDs, for the later films a lot of new information came out. Even the bonus disk is jam packed."
5,Holy S***!!,"I can't believe I found this movie here for only twenty bucks!! I searched every where for this movie. Every place I went, the movie was gone and the price to pre-order it was insane. The film is very informative. It will show the time line of the entire series, but there is something about the Documentary that really interests me. Instead of being a movie that loves the series, it shows the mistakes that were made. It shows how the popularity of the film series, of any film series, could destroy that series. This is for any Nightmare fan who not only wants to not the technical aspect of the films, but how the story was made, what the crews went through and most importantly, how Freddy evolved along with society. I strongly recommend this film especially if you have four hours to watch this film."
4,Quality documentary,"I was very impressed with how this documentary was put together. I found it as an essential supplement to any Elm Street fan and to go nicely alongside the film collection. You pretty much get nearly every star who's appeared in the series (except for the major ones) who recall their tales of experiencing the films at the time.Not only do you just get a mention of each film in the series but you also pretty much get the entire anthology. This essentially includes information on Freddy Vs. Jason, the abysmal Freddy's Nightmares TV series, the franchise and the rise & fall of Newline Cinema.Most of what I covered is just the tip of the iceberg for disc one! The second disc is mainly short featurettes on either additional parts not covered on the first disc or location tributes and the such alike.Overall this is an essential buy if you are an Elm Street fan and looking for something up to date on how the franchise is today."
2,Tag Watch,Not satisfied with product. Had it for three months and the face of the watch in fogging up. Somehow water got into it. It supposed to be a diving watch????
2,Its ok,"Its ok.I think you could derive most of the story from a two page magazine column.The story does really point to the sad truth of how much antagonism, hatred, and competition there is in institutionalized Christianity.And every recognized Christian organization is in on the act.Pastors buttering up the Christian book-store owner, hoping to be able to manipulate the business for his own benefit.Churches angry to see books from a contrasting Christian perspective, because this represents a Goliath too frightening and antagonizing to deal with.Pastors maintaining a death-grip on their sheep, not wanting them to have access to a second opinions from Christian authors.Book publishers pimping anything that can turn a dollar in the ""Christian"" market.And he's the little man who gets caught in the middle of this zoo.Wisdom is justified of her children."
2,Not worth it,"Out of 112 pages, only five deal specifically with what to say in order to talk your way out of a ticket, and the rest of the book deals with general common sense explanations of why officers are people too, all the instances where you CAN'T talk your way out of a ticket, and very brief explanations of some courtroom defenses. While the author has good intentions and provides some basic information, this book will NOT show you how to talk your way out of a traffic ticket unless you just have dumb luck. Check out the Internet for better ""scripts"" and ideas. ..."
2,This book tells the obvious,The above review says it all. That is the whole book in a nutshell. Just be nice to the cop. I do that anyway. It didn't open my eyes or anything. Tells you to use common sense. I didn't need to buy the book to learn that.
1,Bad product - not worth ordering,"After 5 weeks of use, the silicone sides no longer gripped the treo, and my phone kept sliding out. Amazon kindly refunded my money."
4,cute and entertaining,I got this for my grandchildren. It is as entertaining as you or they make it. It encourages them to use their imagination. Fast delivery. Did not come with the red ball shown.
4,Great Moments,"This is a very good 1996 release, although I think Teleportation (2000) is his real masterpiece. But this has many great songs, like SUGAR RUSH and FLOOR ESSENCE are classic Trance Tracks. The tracks I like the best are MOMENT OF TRUTH, SUBTRIFUGE, EVOLUTION, COSMIC ECHOS, AZYMUTH and LOW COMMOTION. I think these are the strongest tracks worth the dollar per download. Although this is a great release, look for http://www.amazon.com/Man-No-Name-Teleportation-Greatest/dp/B00004Y25C/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1204135710&sr=1-4."
4,Save time,"Unlike the fiskars circle and oval cutters, this cutter is capable of cutting any shape. It can be used free-hand but is best when paired with the fiskars templates. Because of this I suggest purchasing the Shape Cutter starter kit instead of buying the cutter individually. The kit comes with four templates and a cutting mat and saves you a bunch of money over buying them all seperately. My one warning about this product is that it takes some getting used to. Practice on scrap paper the first few times and if you're still having trouble take it to a local craft store and ask them to demo it for you, it's much easier to learn in person. Don't let that keep you from buying it though, once you get the hang of it you'll love it. It really is one of the most useful crafting products I own."
5,Wonderful information that is also fun to read,"Charley had written a book that shares good effective information on not only how to win, but how to enjoy the game of Gin. No wonder he is so good. Perhaps equally important is the comfortable way the book reads, filled with anecdotes and storys that add to the meat, and pleasure of reading the book. BTW< I won the next game I played after reading the book, it was against my wife, so I am not sure it is a good thing!Flip Berry"
3,Not quite as good as I expected...,"Whenever I buy a book that has print as big as a childrens book, I immediately get suspicious. Maybe the font size is for the older reader, or maybe he was trying to make it seem like you were actually buying a 100 page book. This books' actual useful content would fill 30 pages in a 12 point font. I guess I was looking for some more examples of those ""hard hands"" and how to play them, and a little more advanced content. That being said, this book is still useful, especially for the beginner to intermediate. However, if you have more than 200 semi-serious money games under your belt and havent lost too much of your wad, you wont get too much out of this. If I were you I would befriend your local expert and watch him play."
1,Not a good teaching book,"There is very little information in this book regarding how to win at gin rummy. For example, the chapter called ""The Card Gods"" encourages the player to mentally concentrate on the card they need so that their opponent will give it to them; how's that for mumbo-jumbo. Then there is the ""Percentages"" chapter where the first sentence reads ""I'm not going to bore you with a bunch of numbers showing percentages""; the obvious question is why then did the author include a chapter on percentages? You are better off saving your money on this book."
2,Unprofessional :(,"I am a poker player, and I am used to read the very best books about gambling (mostly from twoplustwo publishing). This book striked me as being very unprofessional, compared to what I am used to.The author brings out fallacious ideas like you have to ""think about the card you want and it will make you more likely to get it"". This won't help the author's credibility. A good publisher would have never let him publish such non-sense.Also, the overall tone of the writing does not inspire confidence. I was not looking for a novel, but I like it when the author sounds professional.I am not in good position to judge the rest of the book. But that's the scary part! I won't be able to tell the good from the bad!I only recommend that book because I couldn't find many other books about Gin. I advise the reader too be cautious reading this book."
5,Best in Class,"This book is clearly the best on the subject of Real Estate Bubble, I have read most of the recent ones. It allocates a significant portion (7 chapters in section III) to the ""cash in"" part of a crash. Many of the other books do not. Most readers would likely suspect a crash or they would not be reading about the subject in the first place.The book advocates tuning out the media and looking at facts: Housing Affordability Indexes, Household Growth projections, etc., to make decisions. Real Estate is not as good as the media has portrayed recently, and will likely not be as bad as the media is likely to portray it in the event of a crash. A main thesis is the crash will not be national in scope, but regionally confined. It provides solid advice as to when to buy post crash, advocating value investing.You wont be disappointed."
2,Has no useful information,"Real estate is a localized market, but this book is written for a general real estate market. It should focus on one market so that we can understand the analysis and apply it to our own market. Missing many important info when discussing about a market crash such as historical affordability compared to today, historical price reduction, impact of increasing foreclosure, loan origination and percentage (ex. $9 trillion dollars lend out on mortgage in the U.S. 46% are adjustable mortgage. $1 trillion in loan will turn over to the new rate in 2007, another $1 trillion in 2008....etc) Is notice of default and bankruptcy increased lately? How much? What about the impact of oil prices on real estate? What about the new bankrupcy law? any impact?Sell, rent, then buy back is folly according to the author, but never consider sell, rent, invest in other rising markets, then buy back.Excellent section on job growth forecast with good web links."
3,pleasantly entertaining,"Kingsley spins a pleasant tale with a different take on the ""strangers who marry"" premise. She creates an appealing heroine, humorous situations and charmingly eccentric characters like the ""aunties."" Unfortunately, the hero is smug, selfish, and arrogant for most of the story. Kingsley tries to provide a traumatic past to explain the hero's shortcomings but as he is unaware of it, it didn't engender any sympathy for his constant lying. Hugo finally does begin to mature and grow, but then the story abruptly ends! Hugo doesn't really suffer any consequences for his selfish behavior and no one, not even Meggie, ever sees the depths of his deceptions. Kingsley's plot is clever and her story is skillfully written, but the rushed ending was disappointing."
4,Hero prevented me from loving this book,"This was a very good story. It had a charming heroine, some eccentric aunties, and even a pet wolf. If the hero hadn't been such a stubborn <censored>, it would have been great.Hugo spends most of the story laboring under the misconception that Meggie is insane and/or simpleminded. But it's obvious that she's nothing of the sort! His stubborness kept me from truly enjoying this story. Well, OK -- his immaturity and his deceptions didn't help, either.I gave this book a B- at All About Romance."
4,Melissa Manchester albums and CDs,"I had five LPs and three CDs of Melissa Manchester. She is still wonderful singer and her voice was and of course is still spectacular. I love to read the lyrics and listen to her songs at the same time. One of my five LPs of Melissa Manchester was not on the list while I searched thru Amazon.com that I really wanted very much. It was called Melissa Manchester ""Help Is On The Way."" I like one of those songs on that album was ""Talkin' To Myself"" and also, ""Monkey See and Monkey Do"" that Patti LaBelle sang the same song as Melissa Manchester sang before. I also searched CD of Melissa Manchester ""For The Working Girls."" But it was not on the list. I was kinda of disappointed that some of them were not on the list. I really hope someday many albums that Melissa Manchester under Arista, MCA and other record labels sangs in 1970, 1980 and 1990 will be on the list thru Amazon.com so I would love to order more CDs of Melissa Manchester."
5,Women who get back to thr roots of being women,I loved this book. I laughed and cried out loud. I was touched by the depth the author put me in touch with the characters. I felt as if she was writing about my own girlfriends and our traumas. I recommend this book to women who need a break from their own baggage and take a voyage to DISH! (My favorite part had to do with the Cadillac and screaming at the top of your lungs- I laughed for days!!)
3,very old product,"might wanna mention that this is a ball mouse, not laser/optical mouse.and it's quite heavy for a mouse."
5,Excellent Product!,I've had this case for my zune for about a year and a half now. It's gone through a deployment with me and alot of use in the gym when I'm home. I dont use the arm band part. There's a clip on the back of the case. I use that to clip it on my waist. It has a cover to protect the screen too. It's a really nice product. It's taken care of my ipod killer :)
3,Great for little people!,"The arm band looks and feels great but, you better have average arms: 13 to 14 inchs. My arms are 18 inches and the band will not fit around them. I had to return it. That is the only draw back that i see."
4,Best heavy duty arm band for the Zune,This armband does the job well for a big fella like myself. I'm not too sure about those with smaller arms though since it covers some real estate (much like the brick of a Zune Microsoft put out). I do not run with it but rather just vigorous workout on the stair stepper or elliptical machine. In either case it holds well and I don't see why it wouldn't be the same while running.The only other drawback I've noticed are you need to be careful when tightening it on your arm. The design allows for the skin of your arm to pass through the guide slot and if you're not paying attention you'll give yourself an awful pinch.The armband does an awesome job allowing and even enhancing your ability to accurately hit buttons on the Zune's face and the screen is also completely visible while the Zune is packed snuggly into place.
2,trash.,"ilovee that its a big bottle and measurements are on the side, but IT LEAKS FROM THE SIDE EVEN WHEN THE TOP IS SCREWED ON TIGHT."
4,Warning!!!,"For owners of high-definition televisions, be warned that this is merely presented in widescreen format and NOT anamorphic widescreen format.Because this is out of print, some private sellers are asking for exorberant amounts for this. Be forewarned. I purchased it from a seller who offered it at a reasonable rate. I'm trying to complete my Hammer Films collection and ""Dracula: Prince of Darkness"" is a must. (I'm not a big fan of the ""Satanic Rites of Dracula,"" but it's nice to have that, as well.) But I thought it was enhanced for widescreen televisions before I bought it and I was wrong.I give this four stars because Anchor Bay didn't offer these films in anamorphic widescreen. While that is very disappointing, I'm still happy to own it."
3,It's OK,"I'm glad I got the double movie version and not the more expensive ""Prince of Darkness."" Why? The movie's really pretty dull.The DVD quality is fine for both feature films. The ""Prince of Darkness"" disc is incorrectly labelled ""Satanic Rites,"" which is not a big deal. The ""World of Hammer"" extra doesn't play on the 1st disk but does play on the 2nd, also not a big deal since there's no reason to have a double copy of a weak overview of some of the vampire films.I am happy to have the feature films for sentimental value, but this set really isn't very good. This Dracula 4 pack is much, much better for the quality of the movies and the discs:Draculas: 4 Film Favorites - Horror of Dracula / Dracula Has Risen from the Grave / Taste the Blood of Dracula / Dracula A.D. 1972 (2DVD)."
4,"lee returns as the count in ""prince"" and said goodbye to him in""rites""","after years of not playing dracula mr lee finaly came back for ""prince of darkness"" and it is a better film because of it. even though he is off stage most of the time you feel his evil in every frame and this once again has a novel way to kill? our count.rites is the last hammer dracula movie and isf not for peter cushing returning as van helsing this one wouldn't be as good. lee is good but ouly comes to life(no pun ment) when old friend cushing joins him. a very sad ending to the series."
3,How is This out of Print,"Come on ""Dracula Prince of Darkness"" Came out on DVD in 1998 so Yes it is Out of Print but why this . This came out in 2003???Another thing Satanic Rites is Ok but this would have been better if it was ""Dracula Prince of Darkness/Scars of Dracula""It woundnt have to include the bonus disk with Scarsoh well But I Have been Curious on How this went OFP so fast And to think I Was Just Starting to Collect the Hammer Films on DVD around that time Oh Well My Favorite one in the series""Dracula A.D. 1972"" is coming out on DVD in Octoberbut still I mean Iv'e Got these movies I Got the Brazil DVD of Dracula Prince of Darkness and I Have Got Satanic Rites of Dracula under the Title ""Count Dracula And His Vampire Brides"""
2,short and not so sweet,"Musically this is a fine album, but I feel that a modern recording from 1997 should have more than 34 minutes of music!!If Ricky was not allowed to record bluegrass for 12 years and then comes up with an album only 34 minutes long, this does not reflect well on his commitment to the music or to his fans. There are 14 cuts, but the first and the last (5 sec. & 12 sec.)are exclamations! I was looking forward to this album but am quite disappointed."
2,"overrated, Charleston hall is better","I have this album, it is decent but not great as these people say. Live at Charleston Hall is excellent and definately his best."
3,"Pretty good, certainly not their best",but the band is tight and sounding as good as ever. The material (selections) is a bit weak overall and the first and last cut add nothing. The length is disappointing at 35m er so. Their LIVE at the Charleston Music Hall and Brand New Strings are both much better efforts. The LIVE album is particularly good and even more surprising that it's a LIVE album to begin with. You can feel their energy in that...that's one of the things missing here. Still a good listen but look for a discount on it (I got it for under $10 on the music streamer I use) as the length and a $15+ price tag would have wound me up. ;-) ...enjoy...Dave
5,Excellent physical architecture reference,"This is an excellent read for those looking for information on construction and deployment of the physical database model, and all of the accompanying PL/SQL code. From the title you might think it had some information on the effecient data modelling for Oracle, you would be wrong. That's not in here, but what's in here is good all on it's own. Versioning, transactions, locking, the Oracle memory model, it's all in here.The writing is good. If I had a complaint it would be that there could be a lot more illustrations. Particular in the section on locking and latching."
3,Just a rehash of old Edition ...,"I am a great fan of Mr. Kyte. Bought the book with lots of expectations. The book is just a rehash of his previous classic ""Expert one on one Oracle"".I totally have to agree with Lorraine de DBA review. Apart from what I have learned from his previous edition, I did not feel like learning any new 10gfeatures !If you already own the previous book, don't even bother buying this."
4,Very Good Oracle Architecture Reference Manual,If you work with Oracle this is a manual you need on your desk. Not just for DBA's but also for developers who will derive a good insight into how they should be developing their code.Very technical but not to the point that brain freeze occurs.Would highly recommend it.
5,Mandatory Reading for Oracle Developers & DBA's,"This is hands down the best book I've read on Oracle. It should be mandatory reading for anyone working with an Oracle database. Period.I have close to 15 years of experience with Oracle, and have designed and developed large scale (>1TB) transactional systems. I've worn the hats of DBA, architect, developer, consultant, etc. The information in this book is invaluable."
5,Great help for developers,"This book is just amazing. Clear, good writing, withtons of examples, and trying to involve the reader inside Oracle Database Architecture.thanks, Tom!"
1,Great if you don't want to see behind you.,This shade blocks almost all visibility out the back window. The suction cups don't stay up very well either.
1,A waste of money,"I have a baby and was looking for something that would keep the sunlight from his face. Got this product and put it in my car right away, but there were two major problems: First, it doesn't stay -it falls down within minutes of having been installed, no matter how hard you try for it to stay on. Second, when it's been on, it completely blocks the driver's visibility of what's going behind the car. Reversing and driving become dangerous with this on. So between sunshine on my little one's face and the possibility of getting into a car accident, I've obviously chosen the first."
3,"Great Product, Poor Visability","This product is great, as far as what it claims to do. It definitely blocks out the sun, and remains in place well (sometimes a little moisture is necessary on the suction cups). But the visability with this product is poor. As a driver, I'm constantly cringing, hoping that I'm not backing up into someone or something!I'm not sure if any of the window shades provide good visability, so it might just be something that you have to deal with. Although, I'm now thinking about having my windows professionally tinted. I figure it's probably cheaper than backing up into another car, and paying the deductible!"
3,Not my favorite,"I read some good reviews about this and I guess it's the best one out on the market that's similar to this.But I'm not loving it.There is no rear visibility for the driver when this is up, and the suction cups keeps falling off. There's only two suction cups and and it might help if there were four.I'm considering to tint my windows."
5,Offering hope and encouragement,"Antoinette Bosco offers readers hope, encouragement and a sense of the true love God has for each of us in this special book. I was especially touched by her sharing of a few tragedies from her own life, and the grace with which she was able to accept and move on from the pain she must have surely felt, because of her acceptance of God's love and will in these situations. A positive and uplifting reading experience."
5,COMEDY PLATINUM!,"when the forces of evil...or just really bright lights...threaten to cast their sunlamps of destruction on JUSTICE you can bet the forces of pale will be there, doused in at least SPF 40, to protect the innocent!for a weekly web cartoon this is packed with comedy gold...no, paler...comedy PLATINUM!"
3,For Conan or Gaffigan die-hards only,"These were funny when Gaffigan would go on Conan but watching them all in a row gets old pretty quick. I figured this would be the case, but thought the DVD would still be worth the purchase since it claims to include all of Gaffigan's appearances on Late Night. It does, but what they don't tell you is that his stand-up is cut out. So it's just him setting up the Pale Force clips and Conan's reactions. Makes sense for what this DVD is and there are some funny bits but the stand-up would have made this DVD more re-watchable."
2,Nor Factually Accurate,"I turned first to my home state and recognized two errors immediately. Bessie Smith was born in TN and W. C. Handy in AL, not MS. I Like the format of Fandex, but cannot rely on the accuracy. Use with a high degree of caution."
5,Another Favorite,"I've been on a ""Tina Wainscott"" reading spree lately. I picked up her first book ""On the Way to Heaven"" and the sequel years ago. Only in the last year have I started picking up her continuing novels. This is another fantastic page-turner. As I've said before, some authors can only be read on a weekend or you'll end up grouchy at work the next day from lack of sleep.""Dreams of You"" is an original, well-written romance. Adrian and Nikki are great characters and the way they meet is the best I've seen yet. I rarely have anything to criticize in Tina's books, but I did think that in a few points, Adrian didn't have to hide so much from Nikki. Still, it's a minor thing and I loved the book and look forward to re-reading it down the road."
5,Darling Christmas Ornament,"I have one of these for every Chow Chow who has lived with us for over 20 years. I hang them on my Christmas tree and my husband and I find a special place for each one of them. These make lovely gifts too, and also could be used on the top of packages. There are many different breeds and all of them are great. This Tiny One arrived in good condition, no problems with shipping either."
5,Phenomenal,"Why are you sitting there reading reviews? Go get a Jackson out of your wallet, plunk it on the counter and buy this music. Good stuff - nuff said."
4,Great artists pay tribute to brilliant Fat Man.,"On this this 2-CD I've found some excellent tracks like Willie Nelson's own style version of ""I hear you knocking"" and Nora Jones' subtle version of ""My blue heaven"". But hearing all these great artists doin' Domino's repertoire made me realise again how BRILLIANT Fats' own versions are!"
5,Love this cd!,What a tribute! To the person who writes that you would do better to buy a Fats Domino cd I would say this: Buy both. You can't go wrong. This tribute consists of 2 discs (30 songs) containing an amazing assortment of people doing their own thing to honor Fats and support the Tipitina's Foundation. LOVE THIS CD!!! I'm giving it as Christmas gifts to all of my music loving friends.
3,Could be better,"The Fats Domino tribute CD was somewhat disappointing. Many of the artists did a great job of recreating the Fats music, but some were really disappointing. The intrepretation was so wild, you'd never recognize it as a Fats classic."
2,fun listen,got to admit this was an impulse buy.I like the album and covers are well done but I have to admit that I have only listened to this album 3 times and have stashed it in my collection.I will undoubtedly listen again but I cannot say that this album is a smash
5,Cinnamon capsules,I buy this as a dietary supplement. I have Type 2 Diabetes and cinnamon actually does have an impact on blood sugar. I take it twice a day between the times I take my prescribed diabetes meds.
3,Nature's Cinnamon 1000 mg.,This is a fantastic product. I take 4 capsules daily and have actually watched as my blood pressure and blood sugar has dropped.
5,IT SEEMS TO WORK,"I have been taking cholesterol medication (simvastatin) for about 4 1/2 years. Also, my doctor kept telling me that I was ""prediabetic"" because my glucose levels were above normal, so I have been taking two of these cinnamon capsules every morning for the last six months or so. When I saw my doctor today, she said she was very happy because my triglycerides were way down and my HDL cholesterol was up ten points (it has been too low ever since I started seeing her). My glucose level was back to normal. She asked what I had been doing differently, so I told her about the cinnamon. She told me to keep taking it because it seems to be working."
5,Nature's Bounty Cinnamon,I've been taking the Nature's Bounty cinnamon for the past several years. I know for a fact the cinnamon has lowered my blood pressure.
1,Scam packaging. Buyer beware. Only 50 servings,"This bottle contains 50 1gram servings. This product bears a totally misleading label, fit for a false advertising lawsuit. I also didn't find it works as well as 100% Ceylon."
4,Frequency splitter,"I purchased a High-Frequency Splitter to make my cable go to two TV's in the house. The splitter I bought through Amazon did the job great and I get good reception through the splitter as I hoped. Thank you all for your help, Leon."
5,Environmental Conscience,"Too Hot Not to Handle is an excellent documentary that everyone should watch and share with other. We need to aware everyone about the climate changes that our planet is undergoing and the effects it will have on our lives if individuals and governments do not do something about it.The documentary is very clear and easy to understand. Scientific facts are presented in a clear and simple so everyone can comprehend the importance of this issue. It is a great documentary that may be discussed by teachers and educators in general, on science and social courses."
5,GW touches so many things,This movie goes beyond the normal information about global warming. It helped me understand what global warming really is about and all the areas it touches. Everyone should see this movie.
5,Very Educational.,This documentary is fast paced and keeps your attention. Everyone should take a look at this- as the results of global warming affect everyone.
1,"If you want mistakes, buy this book","Any Sherlockian will find all of the errors in this book distracting. If Boothe had done more research, it would have been a decent book."
1,Animal Cruelty at it's best,"For Amazon to be selling this movie, explains it all. Amazon doesn't care what it sells or how bad or gross the content is. The name of the game is money, and that is all Amazon is after. Amazon will not be getting any of my money from here on out."
4,Larry's Review,"This book has provided me with an excellent insight of the basics of linguistics. The chapters on phonetics and morphology give sufficient detail to understand the logical background of our language. Gorge Yule has written in an easy-to-read style, that keeps the reader captivated."
1,Not worth its weight in sand,"From a student who has studied linguistics in the past, George Yule's book is almost a complete waste of time. He brings up interesting points, describes them, and drops them just as quickly without making any sort of progress. The book has precious few examples of the concepts he is discussing, and his discussion of the concepts themselves is muddy and incomplete. For a much clearer way to learn lingustics, check out Edward Finnegan's ""Language: Its Strucuture and Use"". There are many other books out there that do a much better job of presenting the theories in linguistics."
4,The title says it all,It's a good book. The amount of information is amazing.Recommend it for anyone just starting or in the market for a cello.
3,"Good content, bad Kindle formatting","Book content is great; there's some info you should already be familiar with, but lots of gems to keep you from embarrassing yourself more than you might otherwise as you settle in to life in the UK. That said, the reformatting for Kindle is, as seems usual, poor. I really resent paying for digital books that haven't even been spell checked, and this digital text contains a handful of errors which can be particularly confusing if you're not familiar with British lingo and spelling. For this kind of book at this kind of price, errors in the Kindle version are unacceptable-- get with it Amazon!"
5,Very helpful!,"I moved to England a few months ago and this book has been very helpful. It was a pleasure to read - especially while in London and observing first hand the behaviors described in the book! I literally refer back to tidbits I learned from this book on a daily basis. I highly recommend it! (Now if someone could explain to me how to avoid the English blunder of referring to someone in the third person if they are in your presence without having asked them their name first...and in order to do that, introducing myself ""too soon"" in the conversation...I am confused. I am trying not to be offended that some English moms don't introduce themselves to me after I have introduced myself to them! To me that feels extremely rude. Ugh.)"
5,Great book!,"This is an excellent ""study guide"" before going to the UK. I would definitely recommend it from cover to cover. The author is very thorough to the point of giving lists of American words vs. British words with their respective meanings."
5,Flor,Great book! I am a teacher of English from Argentina and I found this book quite useful! I haven't got the chance to go to England to experience life there myself. thanks to all the information that is in this book I know more about British culture and I can pass it to my students! It is well written and sometimes fun! Very useful for someone who is moving there or loves British culture as me! Thanks to the author! Love from Argentina!
4,Hmmmm,"First off, let me say I liked this book. However I've been an American anglophile all my adult life, and I was already familiar with nearly all the subjects brought up in Ms. Hargis's book, so I suppose I'm not really her target audience. However, I did find several thinly veiled insults at Americans which sort of put me off a bit, as I very much dislike being lumped in with the typical ""ugly American"". She implies that the British educational system is superior to ours, and that we're often ""unintentionally"" rude. I daresay, when someone is only uninformed or misinformed, he can hardly be described as rude. She also fails to mention things Britons do that we find crude, like asking for the ""toilet"" instead of the ladies' room. At least she admits we have the upper hand at dentistry, insisting that British kids wouldn't be caught dead with a mouthful of braces. I guess our kids would rather have straight teeth. Anyway, it's a cute book - apart from the patronizing tone."
4,A Really Fun Read!,I had such fun reading this book. It will give the readers many chuckles and surprises to discover the many differences of American English from Brit English.
1,A disappointing read,"Professor Peritz reports lots of detailed facts about the legislative debates and courtroom proceedings surrounding America's antitrust regulations. Unfortunately, he far too uncritically accepts the mythical notion that antitrust legislation was enacted in response to increasing monopolization of the U.S. economy. Peritz ignores the large (and still growing) body of research showing that Standard Oil, the Chicago meatpackers, U.S. Steel, and other firms vilified in popular histories in fact promoted competitive markets -- these firms dramatically reduced prices, improved their operating and distribution efficiencies, and consistently increased the quality of the goods they offered to consumers. With his incorrect understanding of economic history, Peritz's explanations of the origins and role of antitrust legislation and case law are, largely, unfounded."
2,not so great.,"i bought these to try out over papermate clear points because i was having a breakage problem with them but these turned out to be much worse. although the clear point's body will break, all i have to do is wrap some tape around the top where its cracked and i can continue to use it. i had bought these in the hopes that the more solid body wouldnt crack, which it didnt. but of the 12 i bought, i lost 2 or 3, every other one stopped working. i would try to click it so the lead would come out but nothing would happen. i went back to the clear points and wouldnt buy these again"
2,"Operation is too smooth, causes eraser fail","I've long been a big fan of the twist-erase style erasers on Papermate pencils, and have used several packs of Twist Erase II and Twist Erase XP to the point where the rubber grippy part eventually wears out. Decided to splurge a little on a pack of the titanium line, and lo and behold, the eraser mechanism on this model is too smart by half. The part the pencil barrel twists clockwise to extend the eraser, as with the other models mentioned, but with the Titanium model this twisting action has so little friction that normal use of the eraser causes the barrel to twist counter-clockwise and the eraser retracts back into the pencil. Have never had this problem with any other twist-erase cousins. Very unfortunate."
2,Retractable eraser is a pain,"The pencil is well constructed but there is a large design flaw. When you go to click the pencil with your thumb on the eraser, the eraser just twists down until your thumb reaches the body of the pencil and then you can click to get more lead out. The design is good on paper just not in practice."
5,Nostalgic Hawaiian Music with a 1920's twist,"I originally bought this CD because many of the songs are played as background music to the cartoon ""Spongebob Squarepants."" I had no idea that Hawaiian music was so popular in the 1920's and that this CD would contain 1920's rythym sounds on it. The nostalgic 20's beat is an added bonus and makes me feel happy and carefree. It's definitely one of my favorite CD's. I used to play this CD at the bookstore I worked at and the customers absolutely loved listening to it."
3,many other cheaper software do as better as this one,"Well as a writter it is a powerfull wepon but still , there are many other options and less expencie like sophocles try it before buying Final Draft you may save a couple of dollars.atte.marakz Ketofscreenwriter"
1,FINAL DRAFT 6 USED DON'T BUY IT...!,If you buy a Final Draft USED you can't work on it because it's activate only for the first owner. The system block and ask to you to registrate to Final Draft.
5,Screenplays... Just Add Imagination,"I have been trying to develop my screenplays for years, but have always struggled against having to force the Industry Standard Script Format into my scripts. With this program, I can concetrate on the words rather than worrying about the formatting. The program effortlessly snaps into the Industry Standard and makes writing dialogue a snap.With a number of tools built in, this is an invaluable piece of software for any screenwriter's library. It practically pays for itself in the time it saves and the information it can pump out about your stories."
1,Instruction book is worthless and phone support is $$$$$,"As a writer of Novels and Short Stories, I decided to try my hand at a screenplay, using Final Draft 6. BIG MISTAKE! The instruction book assumes you already know how to write a screenplay and never explains the basics. Tech support is very expensive and will cost you more than the price of the software by the time they explain how it works. An instructional video would be helpful, but is not available.My advice would be to not purchase this software unless you know someone who is willing to teach you how to use it. I'm sure it's great for those that already know how to write a screenplay, making it much faster. But for a novice to the trade, it is worthless."
1,No relyable information,"I ordered this item and they said that it was available in stock. But when I bought it and paid for it, delivery was posponed three times without warning or any other form of communication. I wrote them several emails, because my filmproject was jeopardized by this posponements, but they did not reply to any of them.So for me Global Media Pro is not a relyable supplier who live up to there promises.The goods finally arrived and they were okay. But the support and helpdesks of Global Media Pro really sucks. If you must have your goods is time I suggest to look for an more relyable deliverer."
4,Missing Part 2,There is reference to a part 2 and couple months back watched the 2nd part where his old boss finding out where he had got to came west making the whole story as in the book or god forgive there is a 2nd disc?Cued my dish-TV to search for it every other week.Besides like the Croc's girlfriend and historical contribution
1,You've got to be kidding me!,"I'm not sure these other two could have possibly watched the same movie as I! Poor directing, horrible editing, high school camera work, and of course, ridiculous acting, this movie had it all. I took an early day from work, picked up a movie, within twenty minutes I had no choice but to turn it off. It was so bad I went back to work just to punish myself!!"
3,Good Clean Fun But Leaves You Hanging,"I bought this movie for my husband who is a huge Louis L'Amour fan. This movie was so short (90 minutes)and left out so much of the story--- having read the book he just couldn't believe it. The acting was good, the story clean but they really didn't develop the charaters very well. It was almost a comedy. At the end it was like we needed to turn over the DVD to get part two. Too bad becasue my husband said it was one of his favorite L'Amour books. Now I am going to read the book to get the entire story. If you've never read the book you'll like this movie.My hope is that someone else makes a movie on this same book. THE IRISH MUSIC IS WONDERFUL!"
2,Shallow,"As a faithful adaptation of a Louis L'Amour novel this was a shabby effort. As one reviewer noted much of the essentials of the original story were omitted. What was left was barely recognizable. As a western story that stands on its own, apart from Louis L'Amour, this movie was below average & not very interesting. A major sub-plot was left unresolved, and minor questions left unanswered. The acting in the movie was shallow for the most part & far removed from the depth of characters developed by Louis L'Amour, even in his short stories."
2,Save your money,"So far this is the most stupidest movie I have been dumb enough to buy, I'm a Louis L'Amour's fan, but I'm sure glad I missed this one !!!! not even sure what would help this movie besides burning it. at least the disk is good for a frisbee, or target practice."
2,cheap!!!,These socks are not very well made!!! Very thin & will probably wear out fast...these socks are not as good as well know national breand like HANES. Would not recommnd.
3,outdated but useful research info,"This 2 disc set is just ""ok"". The information is outdated and shows a bit more of the old ""gang banging styles"" if you are wanting to do some research into gangs from 80's and 90's era. A lot of show but not truly the good information. Like most gang documentaries it is hard to get truthful and not embellished information from the participants. A lot of time is taken up with members of gangs showing how ""cool"" they are. Its an ok documentary at best."
1,HORRIBLE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I bought this gun on saturday, and i got it on thursday, it broke friday. The clip had broken (it wouldnt stay) the lazer is screwed up it doesnt even line up with the scope. It was the worst purchase i have maybe ever made the only thing that was actually good about it was that the MOCK silencer was o.k. IF YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT IT WILL TAKE AT LEAST 1 DAY TO ASSEMBLE!DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF S*** ONLY IDIOTS WOULD BUY THIS PIECE OF C**P"
4,pretty good,i got ythis gun like a year ago and it looked very good and then i shot it and it was great!! i put the silencer on it and it didnt silence it alot so i guess its just for looks rather than performance. the acessories (eept silencer) are too hard to put on so i didnt use them. it worked great for about 2 months and them my idiot friend tried to load it without the clip( the clip is extended so it holds more rounds and hangs out of the handle) and jammed the gun. i took it apart and got the bb out and then couldnt put it back together so my friend really screwed it up. this is a good side arm in a airsoft war.
3,"It's fun, but a pain to assemble.","There is another airsoft gun very much like this on the market, but the difference is that the other one, you can actually remove all the additional tactical systems. But with this, they're fixed in place so the RIS can't be taken off. Of course the silencer, mag and cross-sight can be removed, but the RIS is screwed in which can be cumbersome. It's also very wimpy as far as the FPS. But you can still have fun with it. Be careful with the silencer, though. Screw it on too hard, you'll break the barrel right off."
4,Nice book,"I'm not ready yet to publish a review but, i may tell you something. This is a Nice book. Seam to be a little outdated because Shake is now 4.0. Shake is a powerfull software and it's a bit hard to learn by ourself. This book will help you but it's not easy to learn that kind of software from a book, a video training will do a better job. Anyway, this book is a good starting point."
5,Totally Worth It,"This book by far is worth every penny. Why? It includes a disc with a 30 day trial for Shake! The software costs so much that many people can't afford it. What if you want to learn Shake, but not buy Shake? Buy this book then... The chapters are easy to follow. The screenshots are helpful as well."
5,goes down easy as a shake,great book. i'm having a good time learning from it. It's very easy to read and follow. i would get one if I were you.
2,its okay,I used it to study for the mathematics CLEP and there were many typos in the questions; the detailed answers showed a slightly different question than the problem. This was very frustrating.
1,DISAPPOINTING; NOT WORTH IT,"Huge SIMPSONS fan since the beginning, and loved the ""Quotable SIMPSONS"" calendar (previous years), but the Trivial SIMPSONS 2002 calendar is AWFUL.Any fan will have little or NO problem answering the questions...It is not amusing, clever or funny...Pictures are simple and repeated; often there is only a large red question mark.The ""Quotable Simpsons"" was far more entertaining (and worthy of sending pages on to other fans), but the current calendar is just a BIG DUD. Bart would agree..Boring, uninspired. Do NOT waste your money... just not worth it."
3,"Tough trivia, but a bit cheap otherwise","I've been stumped almost daily by this calendar. The trivia is pretty obscure. But I was hoping that the art would be a bit better and more rare. Some pages don't even have art, or have a generic question mark icon. The plastic stand is a bit flimsy, too.But as a Simpsons fan, I still wouldn't be able to resist."
3,This is an excellent LP if you like harmonica-heavy blues,"Harmonica-Heavy Chicago blues with burly female vocals, Mississippi Heat will raise the core temperature of any listener. Featuring Pierre Lacocque on harp and Inetta Visor on lead vocals, their approach is unique as he trills a chromatic harmonica over her voice. Released on Germany's Crosscut records in 2003, ""Footprints On The Celing"" includes appearances by Billy Boy Arnold (who started out on Chess Records with Bo Diddley in 1955 and laid the harp tracks to the original version of Diddley's I'm A Man) and Carl Weathersby, who help add depth to the already worthwhile offerings. - all content copyright www.maximumink.com"
1,Ex ExTech User,"I would not recommend this product. We purchased it to check chlorine levels in a small water system. It worked 6 times before it began malfunctioning. It was at that point 2 weeks out of the 30 day warranty, but ExTech replaced it anyway. Too bad the one they sent did not work at all from the beginning. When I have tried to contact them by email, they do not answer me. I was hoping to get my money back, but that I'm losing hope in that too. Don't waste your time and your money- this thing is a total dud."
5,Women of the Dawn- book,"I enjoyed this book written by an anthropologist who studied the lives of four Wabanaki/ indian women who came into contact with Europeans at different times in history. The book is very descriptive, and easy to read /follow the life stories of these four Wabanaki women, and how their lives were effected by European contact. One woman is a direct line ancestor of mine, this is why I purchased more than one copy of the book, since last fall, to give as gifts to my family members."
2,"No, don't do it!!!","This book sucks, waste of money, waste of time, good premise but no no no! Run away, find something else...save yourself."
2,"Too hyper, feministic, silly","This book me a while to read. Gemma Barton was not a likeable character. The book was all over the place, and seemed a little immature."
2,"Wish I had cocktails, instead of wasting my time on this book","It has taken me months to read this book. I would read a chapter one night & let it sit on my nightstand for two months before I felt the need to pick it up again. I really could not relate to the characters. There were no exciting events in the book. The main character Gemma begins a website called allmenarebastards.com & the website takes off, creating her a new career. She deals with a struggle of an ended relationship & the ups & downs of several friendships. It has a happy ending, but I must warn you: there was no exciting climax, along with no plot. It was not the most boring book I've read, but not very interesting. I don't recommend."
5,sound from a bygone world,"What a beautiful sound emanates from each of these performances. The ""Engima"" in particular is a work that has always sounded best in mono. Don't ask me why--all right, ask me if you must--but somehow the digital versions are a hash and most of the analogue-stereo versions are not better. If you need stereo, get the Mehta/L.A., but otherwise look for Elgar's own performance or Henry Wood's or the lovely Harty on this CD. Besides being a fine composer, Harty was a conductor of genius all of whose records repay listening. And the Halle orchestra, from whatever period, is always worth hearing. Buy this one used and don't look back.Look for me at the S.F. Symphony or S.F. Opera. That's where I live now. I'll be the one in the ruffled shirt."
4,Good desk except the keyboard tray,"The product was shipped in a timely manner, and was pretty easy to setup. The desk is compact and fits in my CHU (military term). The desk is sturdy too; not bad for such a low price. My only gripe is that the keyboard shelf was ccumbersome to install and sticks a little when I attempt to move it back & forth. Worth the price for soldiers and college students."
1,Don't read this author's mind,"This is more a book chronicling folk music in Canada thru the1960's and 70's. I don't believe this author ever spoke directly to Mr. Lightfoot. You can read 4 or 5 pages and his name does not even get a mention. Not only do I believe he never spoke to him, I don't believe he likes him. When Gordon Lightfoot's name is mentioned, it's usually included in a snide remark and a very subtle put down.My recommendation is don't waste your money reading this author's mind."
4,Wonderful book for the unusual places,"This is an older book that covers 100 towns and villages. I loved the variety that you don't get in tha big name books, although, how I wish there were pictures!"
5,That's what I'm talkin' about!!!,I wanted some Cajun music and found what I was looking for! Fantastic! Daddy loves it too!
4,Insightful!,"The 3 Keys to Empowerment revisits the three keys discussed in another Blanchard book, Empowerment Takes More Than a Minute. These three keys are: share information with everyone, create autonomy through boundaries and let teams become the hierarchy. They should be applied to each of the three stages of moving toward empowerment. Many of the actions suggested for the initial stage: ""Starting and Orienting the Journey,"" are repeated in the discussions of the other stages, ""Change and Discouragement"" and ""Adopting and Refining Empowerment."" The authors say some areas need repeated focus so readers can implement change. Unfortunately, this is repetitive.The book's most useful feature is the Empowerment Action Plan, a clear, easy to follow list of specific actions leaders can take at each stage of the journey to empowerment. The 3 Keys is written for CEOs and senior executives."
4,"brilliant illustrations, wonderful retelling","The illustrations in this book are reminiscent of the lacquered boxes that come from Russia - textured, detailed, and layered. A gorgeous book retelling a classic Russian tale - a wonderful addition to any child's library, but particularly children adopted from Russia."
4,Beautiful,"This is a beautiful book, both story and illustrations are lovely. It is a great adition to anyone's library, offering an ethnic taste of Russia."
3,Magic Nesting Doll,"Magic Nesting DollI sent it with only a glance at the story, which seemed okay.,although probably a bit difficult for the young girl I sent it to."
5,excellent example of Mr Hick's preferred style,"Mr Hick's professional awards are well deserved. I have read that his is more of a Texas swing style (as opposed to bluegrass) and I think this CD is a good example. Although as I recall the 1st track has a hard driving bluegrass rythym. Regardless of personal preferences, anyone should appreciate the talent level of Mr Hicks as well as the musicians he assembled for this CD."
1,A Poor Performance Bobby Hicks,"What was Bobby Hicks thinking about when he recorded Fiddle Patch? He has ruined some good fiddling by including three vocals which would make any country music lover cringe - they are straight out of the Top Forty charts. As examples of soppy, stupid, schmaltz they excel and should never have included in an album of traditional fiddle. You have ruined this CD for us Bobby please do not do it again!"
3,Ok but not good enough...............,"Todd Lammle did wonders with the CCNA study guide, and if your studying for the CCNA his book is the only one you need. This one how ever needs proof reading and accuracy on his part. The included ""simulated review questions"" which we all are looking for are a JOKE. 8 questions are all you get (even though you get to do it on two separate simulated routers..oh joy!).The review questions on the CD are not in-line with what you read. Use this and something else if you really want to pass the exam...I plan too.It may be DDDRRRYYY reading, but try a book from CISCO press"
4,audio lacking,"Love the show but the audio is lacking. It sounds like once the sounds gets above a certain level it gets ""clipped"" resulting in distorted audio especially noticeable if viewing this on a decent system. Please note I'm a big fan of Rufus and was disappointed to hear the degraded audio on this DVD. I paid $30.00 for the CD/DVD combo from my local store so I feel like I have been let down somewhat."
2,high school students would benefit most,"These cards are attractive and easy to use. They contain all the necessary information, plus cognates. They do not have proper long marks on roots and principal parts, however. Sometimes the infinites of 2nd and 3rd conj. are marked, but incorrectly much of the time. This lead me to fill in this information myself with a good dictionary, and I found mistakes in marking and spelling, insufficient definitions, etc. on quite a few cards. Technical problems aside, this is quite a simple vocabulary, which Latin students would learn in the first semester of a college course. I expected as much, but did not foresee the paltry amount of verbs in this set. This was a poor purchase, but I can still see it benefiting a high school student willing to correct and expand every card."
4,"Mazes offer variety, good product","My son just turned 5 & loves doing mazes on the kids menus at restaurants. My son also loves dinosaurs. This book was smaller than I expected, but the mazes seem to be the perfect size inside. They are not too hard, yet challenging enough to hold his attention."
3,Index card size book about 1 hour of entertainment,"This book is about the size of a big index card.The mazes are fairly simple for a 5 year old, but still entertaining. He finished the book in about an hour.It would be good for a dinner out, a car or airplane trip etc."
3,Mazes too easy,"My 5 year old son loves mazes, but he found this book to be way to easy. He finished the book in a half hour sitting at dinner at a restaurant."
3,ok for it's size,"It's my fault I didn't look at the size of the book in the description, I was expecting a size of a regular coloring book. But the mazes seem too small for my 5 year old to do in the car during trips, which is what we had planned on using them for."
5,Easter gift,This is for the Easter egg hunt and the kids will love it as it is a challenge for them to do the mazes.
5,Ascension needs to be heard- now !,"Billionaire's Ascension is a the sleeper CD of the season. The range in styles from song to song is quite amazing. The influence of a number of bands such as the Beetles, Led Zep, Radiohead and Counting Crows are detected in numerous tunes. Don't get me wrong, they don't copy any of these bands, they blend the sounds to give an original sound unlike any band so far. This is melodic,alternative rock, in it's best form. You won't be disappointed."
4,Top of the Top 24,Creative book with some good meanings and a good start to baby names but not as factual as I really like so try an Oxford baby names book for truer meanings.
3,"As such things go, not bad","Baby name books are rarely anywhere near as informative as they claim to be. I have an early edition of this one. While it's interesting in its organization, and has some cool lists, some of the definitions are blatantly off, even to my eye.The author's clearly tried, and as an indiscriminate collector of names real and invented, I like the book, but for God's sake don't treat it as an authority."
2,"Library of Congress Recordings, Vols. 1-3 Woody Guthrie","A good set if you wish to listen to a person question Woody.Because of Arlo, 20 years ago I went to see a 1 man show of Woody Guthrie. The person that did the 1 man show did a great job. I say this because he made me want to know Woody's songs.This set was okay. I got to listen to Woody speak some of his thoughts.But for Woody music --- The Asch Recordings are excellent!"
3,Somewhat Helpful,"This book has a good overview and general explanation of how things are designed in 3D. It takes you through the commands and tools step by step, with surprisingly few misprints. The CD that comes with it has the free demo program, and some tutorials. However, the lack of a glossary makes it an unnecessarily tedious read for anyone not familiar with advanced geometry and math. My dictionary wasn't much help. More serious omissions became apparent as I tried to use Rhino, like the very short entry on Boolean Unions. He doesn't even mention that they can fail to work, much less offer any solutions. This book saved me some time learning basic tools, and helped with general concepts, and is probably better than not having a text at all. I haven't bought Rhino yet, so I can't compare this to the manual that comes with the program."
4,manual for normal,"In ""Manual for Normal"", Rebecca has expertly brought a group of flawed charactors to her pages. Her creative skills are unmatched by dimension. There are assortments of conflict and many twists and turns. Don't look for the nebulous. It is a good read."
3,repeat repeat,customers who also bought live in london discovered what i did... it's identical to this one... except that one is region one and this is region two. see live in london for reviews.
5,Delicious!,"Living in Alaska I am drawn to try various Alaska cook books and this one is outstanding. There is an awesome recipe for ""Pepper Relish"" that my husband and his friends beg me to make. In fact friends have bought there own copies of the book becouse I wont loan it out. I've got sticky notes all throught the book with my own reviews and temtations! Its Simple to read and easy to understand recipes. These arent the copied versions of foods you have had before, and she writes a jounal throughout the book to make you feel as if your a guest at her lodge. I hope to find more of her recipes! You will love this very interesting and well written cook book!"
4,fiberglass axe handle,"Good handle! The instructions for gluing the handle to the tool are OK but I would like to stress that things can get messy if your epoxy leaks out.This handle came with a gasket and backstop ridge which suggests filling epoxy from the front of the tool. The instructions tell you to tape the tool shut at the front, fill with epoxy, and insert the handle. Both will work. JUst make SURE the tool fits nice and straight, and that the epoxy cannot leak out.Amazon still shows the wrong picture. A handle kit contains a handle. PLUS the epoxy."
1,Orthene Fire Ant Killer too expensive!!!,"I only gave it one star since it is so expensive to use this product for only 12oz. This was created by the Chevron chemical company when Diazanon and Dursban were still sold OTC and created a third alternate for those who did not want to treat their whole yard due to their pets safety. Diazanon and Dursban could be purchased for around $5 to treat the whole yard or 5000 sq.ft. in the mid 90's. Also,Orthene in a 16oz can could be purchased for around $5 too. Why pay $10 today to treat 2-3 large mounds, and not have an inexpensive alternative. With water restrictions, you can't hardly water the granular insecticides in any longer, except 1-2 days per month? Don't buy fire ant killers with Imidacloprid, since this kills honeybees. Look for Talstar instead by FMC."
5,Sensational results,This product performed exactly as advertised! It is one we will continue to use and to recommend.
3,it really effective.,"Most powerful fire ant killer. It does not matter how large or small the fire ant mound is, only 2-shake application will kill whole colony within 12 hours. Do not need any watering, only shake a little bit power, That is it !! So easy to apply, but really effective."
1,Do not buy Vizio,"My almost 2 yr old 50 in Vizio PDP died and the 5 yr warranty purchased form Vizio [Warranty Corporation of America] has not gotten a service person to call my home after 10 days. Vizio [where I bouoght the warranty] claim that it is not their responsibility and suggested I call Warranty Corporation of America, a 6th time. Do not buy Vizio. I paid over $3000 for the PDP and 5 year warranty."
4,"Good TV, Great price","I own two other HDTVs from Panasonic and Polaroid and the Vizio is as good and better priced.Picture quality is great and sound is good. The only thing I don't care for is the source input which requires you to cycle through all the inputs (TV, HDTV, comp1, comp2, HDMI, etc) to get to the one you want. A drop down menu would be nicer.The TV is also a little thicker and heavier than the 50"" panasonic, but not enough to be a drawback."
1,Cheap price for a reason,"I have nothing but problems with this tv. I am currently waiting for a replacement tv. This tv is junk. The customer support was great and helpful. The customer service could care less about me or my problems with the tv. The picture on the tv was great while it worked. Now it is hanging on my wall dead as a door nail... Estimated time for replace is 5 weeks. The reseller doesn't provide any customer service/support you have to go thru Vizio. After report the latest problem that the tv is dead, they are estimating 20 days for a replacement to be shipped from CA. After spend two weeks waiting for a fat and stinky technician to come to my house, replace a couple parts, and leave. Two hours later the tv made a cracking sound and died... I don't know about you but I feel this is bad support of a product. I am not enjoying my $1,800 tv on the wall and I can't even watch the Super Bowl. My advise, spend a little more money and buy a better quality tv."
4,The Closer,I enjoy this program very much. It does not have any cussing or bad language to speak of and it is not too violent considering the type of program it is.
5,Quality Crime Solving With Great Personality,"Compared to the vast digital ocean of Crime dramas, The Closer manages to really create a cast of characters you love and crime stories worth watching. Absolutely a fantastic show. Can Wait to finish the rest of the 7 seasons. Plus kyra sedgwick is absolutely amazing!"
5,A superb solo debut.,"Juan Tavares was Grupo Liberacion's former lead singer and while the overall sound and style are not really that different from those of his work with Liberacion, he does get some excellent romantic material here. While much more pop ballad-oriented than one might expect this CD is quite good in comparison to most of his contemporaries' recent releases. Juan Tavares most definitely deserves to become a Latin pop superstar."
5,Best disposable gloves for me,"If these are the same as the one i used to get at Orchard Supply Hardware but are no longer carried there, they are the only ones i like to use. They come in a big box of 100. The other brands i get which come from Rite Aid or CVS are only 50 to a box and cost almost as much. But the main reason i want these instead of the others is that they are so easy to get on. I have thought it's because they're a little bigger, but i just noticed on the box it says they are lightly powdered. Maybe that's why, but i think they're slightly bigger because they fit more loosely than the others. That makes a big difference to me, to not have to struggle to get them on, whether it's the powder or the size."
4,Peter Green Smokes!!,"This box set is an amazing insight into perhaps the greatest british blues band of the sixties. The quality of these recordings is excellent, with the CD mastering being near perfect they sound as if they were recorded yesterday. The performances themslves are as good as you will ever hear. The only downsides are the way the tracks contain every take for a song as one track, and the unfortunate ability of Spencer to develop his skills beyond simply repeating ad infinitum the dust my broom riff - which gets a little tiresome. However this box set is an extremely worthwhile purchase and one I would thoroughly recommend to fleetwood mac fans, or any blues fan."
2,Slow torture,"This collection is marred, for me, by the way in which alternative and incomplete versions of the same songs are continually placed one after the other, all on the same track."
3,"Early Mac sessions, not a substitute for the early albums.","Personally I fall into the catagory of the completeist that would really enjoy a set like this, although I would not recommend it for those not familiar with early Mac. All the takes of the same song gets a bit overwhelming and the Eddie Boyd tracks have been left off to the ""Pious Bird"" disc which was a bit of a disappointment. Also, while I respect the fact that they bring you the original album artwork, I find it a little confusing since it really does not reflect the material on the discs themselves. If you want to familiarize yourself with early Mac, get the first one and maybe ""Pious Bird of Good Omen,"" ""English Rose"" (if you can find it)or ""Then Play On."" If you enjoy those, then maybe this boxset is for you. It is really hard to argue with the value factor here, though. Six discs for under $40 is a good deal anyway you slice it."
5,great buy,"I love this kit have used several like it. I used this one as an addition to my newest pond and used the one I had like it in the new waterfall. So far it has been great, I have not had to clean it once and has been in there for over a month. the pond is crystal clear! Getting ready to purchase another one for back up since such a great deal!"
5,Scientific and helpfull,"I found the book great in the completion of my thesis, it is thorough, scientific, and very interesting. I really would like to own a copy of this informative text. There was good information about the identification of the taxa, the distributions, and interesting facts in the biology and natural history of the species in their countries of origin. Very usefull...."
5,Can't have too much airflow,"Very quiet, no mechanical issues.Have all Pana fans in bathrooms and all of them are at least 3X recommended airflow. Don't skimp on ventilation in your remod. You can run the shower full blast in all my bathrooms and there will not be even a hint of fog on a mirror, the fan will make it hard to close the door, it pulls that strong. Your buddy from college could try to destroy the place after a binge of white bread, bad clams and cabbage and will fail with this fan in a 10x7 bathroom. You get the idea.Cleaning the squirrel cage can be a bit of a chore but you probably only need to do that every couple of years. Reliability of all my Pana fans, including this one, has been a non-issue. But, hey, it's an AC electric motor, not the space shuttle so that's not a surprise."
5,Great Fan for Smoking Lounge,"I bought this fan to replace my current exhaust system in my basement smoking lounge. I have only had 2 people smoking cigars in there at the same time with this fan, but so far it is a marked improvement. The fan is very quite considering how much air it moves, and with the door shut you cannot hear it from outside of the room. This is a great buy, and I would recommend this fan to anyone with the need for this much power."
3,Not as quiet as advertised,Installed FAN and it works well removing steam from shower but is not WHISPER quiet far from it can hear it outside bathroom with shower running and door closed.
1,"Nice from afar, far from nice.","Unacceptable quality of workmenship. Even for $20.Pros:Nice blue box, unmarked.Frontal view of pendant is nice and shiny, just as pictured.Cons:Easily noticible mold line with ugly blotches along the entire inside circumference of the pendant.Thin chain, not shiny, not glamorous.It resembles a $100 Tiffany's pendant chain but the blotchy mold line really junks this other wise decent pendant. I decided not to give this gift so it's just collecting dust now. I can't return it because it says you need a certificate of appraisal or something."
1,Garbage!,The clasp was broken when I got it. The chain is so cheap that I could pull it to pieces with gentle tension. The heart is so cheaply made that you can see the glue that stuck the two halves together.
2,its funny,"i got this for a valentines day present and within 20 min of wearing it, the clasp broke and is unrepairable. LOL it was more funny than anything else. it does somewhat feel cheap because you can see the melding on the inside of the pendant. i got another bracelet that was cheap and from amazon and it broke later that day when i tried to take it off. so i received two pieces of cheap sterling silver jewelery from amazon that broke in the same day. in this case i would say you get what you pay for. they have the exact same design at tiffanys, if you want one guaranteed to not break on you."
4,Good halogen bulbs,"We have 8 of these bulbs in our bathroom, and the first one just went out, so I figured that others would be going soon.I was very pleased that the shipping for the 10 I ordered was not much more than the listed shipping cost for 1 would have been"
3,"good players, good music, bad technology","on my CD the top end is kinda gone. listening thru a blanket here. no presence, no attack noises on the strings, no highs ...i've heard this same kind of recording muffle on other Rounder CDs. not sure why. is it just me?grier does some good stuff though."
4,The Future of Horror,"I had recently learned of chris la martina and jimmy george from a freind , that these were up-coming indie filmakers and being a filmaker myself i had took an intrest in this movie, after veiwing it i gotta say ive seen the future of horror & its chris la martina , I reccomend this film to any movie fan, ok I know the artwork on the Dvd isnt the greatest but dont let that sway you, get this movie and keep your eyes peeled for there next feature Presidents day!"
5,Inspiring,"This is an outstanding photo book. It is oversized, and the pictures are of extremely high quality. If you are a mountain lover, this book will be perfect on your coffee table."
3,The vocals detract,"Hrm. I frankly envy those who can listen to this album without being bugged by the vocals, because there's a lot of good stuff going on here. Unfortunately, while I can excuse the relative blandness of Jason's voice, the fact that he regularly goes off-key is a lot harder to get past.Leiahdorus could be right up there with Mesh, Iris, De/Vision, et al. on the forefront of the dark-synthpop revival, but I don't see it happening with this particular singer."
2,Hard to Hold,"This cup is very elegant but it is really hard to hold. If you're a righty, it tilts left unless you put a lot of pressure on your thumb against the told part of the handle. Also, in order to hold it, you have to slide your 3rd and 4th fingers through the holder but it ends up touching the cup, which may be hot from coffee or tea. My mother and mother in law both made the same comment - that the ergonomics of the cup is NOT GOOD. Oh well, at least it's kinda pretty though."
3,Easy,"To someone who is used to more intense workouts (pre-pregnancy), this will seem like a very easy video. Some stretches don't feel like they're doing much, but there are some moves that feel really nice. I have to say, when the video ended I was left with the feeling ""Is that all?"" Definitely one to use on days when I don't really feel like a real workout."
3,Fits well on my shoe but not big enough for credit cards,After much research online and in-store found this product. Shoewallet Active Gear LLC had to ship this product twice (first one did not arrive) - thanks. Fits well on my shoe and does not move - well made. Standard credit cards & drivers license go outside ([...])!
5,Awesome!,Just what you would expect from a Digimon Tamers manga! The story matches up with the original Japanese broadcaat of the show.
5,The perfect laundry hamper,"This laundry hamper is reliable, (reasonably) easy to carry, can be closed up if need be, and can be compressed down to a circle for storage or transportation. It's especially well-suited to closet use. I would find be hard-pressed to devise a more recommendable laundry storage and carrying device."
2,Not tough enough...,"I loved the size and style of this hamper, however it did not last long at all before the bottom wire popped out and protruded through the side. I ended up buying a nice sturdy Rubbermaid type hamper which has lasted 5 times as long, showing no wear and tear, and I got it on sale for about the same price. I guess my advice would be to hang on to your money and keep and eye out for a good deal on something better!"
1,Worthless Both Ways,We tried to use it for towels. The opening is to small to make it useful and once more than four towels are in thier it collapses. So we switched it to regular clothes which worked fine until my wife picked up after a week of owning it and it was growing mold all over the bottom of it and our laundry room is up stairs and dry and the three old cloth hamper next to it doesn't have a trace of mold anywhere on it. My wife had to throw it out and the money this thing cost me. OH WELLL.......
4,Almost Perfect,"This is a nice hamper. The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that I felt a bit misled by the description. It reads ""2-Piece top features a slit for adding clothes as well as a zipper for easy emptying"" I must disagree with the easy to empty part.Since only half the top can be unzipped, you cannot just dump the contents into the machine or on the laundry room floor for easy sorting. So far it is holding up well. The hamper is lightweight and the handles make it easy to move from the bedroom to the laundry room. Something sticky got into the bottom and it was easy enough to clean up with some water and a rag."
3,worked fine until metal poked through at the bottom...,"it folds quick and it's fun for the kids to use and play in. though after 1.5 yr of use/abuse, the metal spring/support came through the bottom of the basket (the stitching couldn't hold it in any more). otherwise, zipper works great and handles are handy. nice size."
4,This is a very thorough reference book.,I am a wedding consultant and I use this book to address all types of etiquette issues. No consultant -- or bride -- should be without it.
4,"It's Proper, Proper & Proper!!!","The most Proper way you would need your wedding to be. Tells you the proper way to address invitations & announcements, the proper things to include in a Bride's Trousseau, proper march-in, proper wedding registry, proper blah, proper dee... I need one of these proper books to know what to do, & how to do it properly. Maybe you do, too!"
2,Good set but poor quality.,The designers of this set should of known better then this once you take them out of the packages and move the arms the joints already starts to want to come off because of the poor quality of plastic.Trust me that is not even the worse part the joints are very poorly positioned making the arms next to impossible to position in under 14-20 seconds sadly the best joints on these figures is the knees ironic. These figures should of been a harder quality plastic much like the hasbro or takara plastic instead of this soft quality plastic.So buyer bewared.But one good thing came from this transaction the seller was great.
1,Poorly suited for Dreamcast,"If you're interested in using this toy right away and in high-quality video, look somewhere else. First of all, the package doesn't come with a Dreamcast adapter; there's only a note on the back of the box that you can send away for the adapter, which will be mailed to you, ""see manual in box for details."" When you open the box, there's no mention in the manual of how to send away for the adapter.Even assuming you get the adapter, you'll have to be satisfied with the resolution and sound that you can get from an RCA coaxial connector. You can't use the stereo plugs or an S-video connector with this thing.For my purposes, my evaluation is this: unusable!"
1,Worthless,This is the most worthless piece of junk I've ever purchased. Also the company provided zero help on any of the problems I had -and asked me to pay shipping to return the item. No Dreamcast adapter is included and the support line said they didn't know how to order one -I'd have to call a different toll number to try and find out. After 15 minutes of long distance I finally gave up. Sega should be embarassed to allow a company such as this to use their logo on their advertising. If I could have given 0 stars instead of 1 star I would have.
1,Scan errors abound,"This text is readable but has scan errors everywhere. It was not proofread. It was not even run through a spell-checker. ""Jong"" for ""long""? There are random italics on every page. This is a wonderful novel, it is incomprehensible how someone could put it up for sale without even spending a few hours to clean up the scan."
1,Gryphon in Glory,Story line was really good but spoilt by the bad quality of the grammar. I agree with the other review on this book it should have been checked before release.
3,Beautiful..but lacking,"A friend recommended that I read this book, citing Norton's beautiful prose. She was right..it is beautiful. Often, throughout the first 100 pages I was struck at how fluid the language was..and the story was interesting too. It was a classic epic fantasy quest..until halfway through the book.Then it turns into a love story. The reader is subjected to Kerovan's thoughts on Joisan, and Joisan's thoughts on Kerovan. Norton didn't make it any easier on the reader by alternating viewpoints between Joisan and Kerovan. Example: Kerovan is walking, reunites with Joisan, is overcome with emotion, switch to Joisan viewpoint..we go back a few hours and don't come back to the Kerovan scene for another 10-15 pages. I've never liked a writer who holds the reader hostage.It's a good book. I didn't understand some references because I didn't read the first book, so I recommend starting at the beginning."
1,Sent me the wrong book...,"I ordered this Gleim book because my school has the Gleim software. They sent me the wrong book. I received the the Jeppesen FAA Knoweldge Test book. With school I havent had time to report this issue, I will change this review if the issue is fixed."
1,Don't waste your money,"It only runs for about 15 minutes with a child who weighs 50 lbs. Doesn't run well over pine needles or leaves. (Make sure to rake the yard before riding!) The acceleration in slow, the child pushes on the pedal and nothing happens. I spent most of the 15 minutes run time push starting the thing. It stops when the child tries to make a tight turn. All of this was on the grass-it was advertised as being rugged off-road capable, when in fact it only works on the paved driveway. Don't hold your breath waiting on hold for live customer service person...it's been 3 days and still haven't heard!"
5,Is it worth it???!!!!!,"I have been wanting a go-kart for a long time now. Now I am really starting to take action! Driving has always been one of my passions, even though I'm not old enough to drive. I would really like a electric go-kart because I don't want to pollute and I don't want to spend money on gas. Please let me know if the Minimoto Jeepster Dune Buggy is good,bad,ok or if you recommend any other electric go-karts. I would appreciate if you would let me know if there are any other sweet electric go-karts or if this Jeepster is a good one to choose.Thank you for reading my question!! Please type back!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,plz sum1 review,yeh um i have'nt gotten this i'm still waiting for a review so will sum1 reiview it plz so i can see if its worth it
3,'Woman' better than 'Vampires',"If I had to choose between the two of them, I would choose Frankenstein Created Woman as being the better of the two. The story was coherant and the acting was very good. Cushing, of course, gets the most kudos, if only for getting so frosty at the beginning of the film. While not one of the great Frankenstein films, it is quite enjoyable.As for Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires, what can you say. It's an interesting mix of Western and Eastern views on vampires (the other Chinese vampire flix I've seen all seem to have the vampires more like the seven than like Dracula). If you're looking for a Dracula heavy story, bypass this. If you don't mind having your vamps mixed with kung fu, this is your movie.All-in-all, worth the time if you're interested, but not absolutly must have."
1,2 Horrible Hammers,"These are 2 of the dumbmest Hammer Movies everFrankenstein Created Woman was Dull ""I Thought Evil of Frankenstein was Better""Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires was pointless ""I thought Satanic Rites of Dracula"" was Better I have this for completing the Frankenstein and Dracula Series Here is my Anchor Bay Hammer collectionDracula Prince of Darkness/The Satanic Rites of DraculaThe Lost Continent/The ReptileScars of DraculaHorror of FrankensteinFrankenstein Created Woman/Legend of the 7 Golden VampiresThe Mummy's Shroud/Plague of the ZombiesThe Devil Rides Out/Rasputin the Mad MonkDr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde"
2,This drive is not for Macs.,"I bought the Plextor because of the good reviews that I read on Amazon's site. It must be a great machine but I could not get it to work on my Mac. It is advertised as a Mac product but the enclosed manual was mostly PC based and the accompaniing software was entirely for PC. So I went to CompUSA, bought Toast Titanium 5 which is the most widely used burner software for Mac ..., went home and wrestled with it some more and finally...called Plextor tech Support. Toast is incompatable with the Plextor CD-RW! So I'm packing it back to Amazon today.I went to Mac Warehouse and bought a CD-RW by LaCie, which is a very Mac friendly company."
1,Don not buy this junk,"Total waste of money.This guy may write a lot but it doesn't mean he ever got out of the hamster wheel. However, the idiot professor's teaching world-systems, and they are all idiots, because the whole topic should be trashed, as the theory was destroyed by Brenner and Skocpol in 1977, yet they go on. So the institutions that teach this manure and the many ""scholars"" who try to make sense of it, wing it. So stay away from world-systems. You will be sorry, especially if you follow Chase-Dunn who probably foams at the mouth. He would have made a good politician."
4,Great book for cross country and telemark skiers,"This is a great book if you are looking for a guide to some of the best cross country and telemark trails, however since i was looking for more of a downhill backcountry guide, this is not really what i was looking for, but it is still a very informative and well written book."
3,"Vivid color, a little short on durability","This hamper has color as vivid as the photos and is a great addition to a child's room, especially for the price. Other hampers cost 4x more for the same type of product. However, the wire frame near the edge did come out its slot and I had to push it back in, but I think I tried to stuff too many clothes in it and move it to another location, and that was too much. It apparently is not that durable to pick up and move around while it is very full of laundry."
4,Cute but not realy all that durable,"Very cute hamper and was perfect for the corner of our kids' bathroom, but within a few months the wire that runs through the seem to border the head/lid popped through the end of the seam and made the entire thing fairly useless. Actually, we could still use it by just keeping it open, but then I could have purchased a wicker hamper for that. Ehhhh... good for a few months."
2,So cute...wish it lasted!,"I had wanted this hamper for a long time to go in my son's jungle nursery. I finally bought it and now wish I hadn't. We haven't even had it for six months. My son doesn't play with it. I only use it for his laundry and I don't even fill it to the top or else it holds too many clothes to do in one load. I carry it by the handles to and from the laundry room. The wire that holds up the lion's head poked out so I pulled it all the way out. Now the wire that makes up the body of the lion is poking out and there is no way to push it back in or pull it all the way out. I wish I could keep it, but I don't want to risk my son hurting himself. It is also too much hassle to set the lion upright because the paws and tail fold up underneath the lion when setting it down and I hate having to straighten those out every time. All in all, a very cute hamper, but poor quality!"
3,fine for kids room,it holds a week's worth of my two boys' clothes (ages 2 and 4) - not the most durable so don't let your kids play with it (they do try - the lion is very tempting!). it adds nice decor to a child's room - for the price it's definitely worth it
3,adorable,"adorable, Im using it as a laundry basket for my toddler, but the wired around the lid is popping out, so its going to go in the garbage as a hazzard after very little use unfortunately."
1,no sew,So sorry that this is a very bad product. Singer went out of business many years ago and only sold the right to use the name. This machine sewed 2 quilt tops before freezing up and had to be thrown away totally useless and not fixable. It is a nice size for taking to quilt class but needs to keep working more than 2 months.
5,Terrific and Surprising,"This is a great novel. It jumps back and forth between old London and new New York, and really nails the atmosphere of both. It's one story--a classic tale about a young guy coming from a small town to make his fortune--but it ends up not being what you expect. It provides no simple morals about the stock market mess that we just want to get through, but instead suggests that it wasn't all about greed, but about a dream of power and possibility, too (though also about greed). And the book is hilarious in places. There's one incredible scene that takes place in Bedlam, the lunatic asylum where Londoners of the time went for entertainment. And there are loads of other really memorable scenes. It's one of those books you just enjoy thoroughly and effortlessly. A+."
3,Talented but Empty,"Extravagance is a nice quick read with a formal talent of a literary experiment, written alternately in the style of The Sot Weed Factor and Bright Lights, Big City, but is ultimately as empty as the platitude that there's nothing new under the sun. One problem is that ordinary investors/readers who lost money and, as a result, were left with a sour taste in their mouths from the internet bubble of the 1990's won't like the light way the book reminds us of that era."
4,Grizzlys make some of the best bags I have purchased,"The only reason I would give this review as high a rating as I did is because of past experience with the grizzly brand bag. Because I never recieved my bag. I was not impressed with the customer service of Bargain Outfitters and the way they dealt with my order. First off their expected deliver time with a 7 day span of time. Then, after they charged my card, my bags never showed up. I had to call them 2 days after the last day they were supposed to be delivered. Only to find out that my order had been canceled because they didn't have that bag anymore. I think they should have contacted me on that, not waited for me to get that information on my own."
2,Beautiful - but poorly made.,"The chain and pendant are beautiful - exactly as described. However, after only wearing it twice, the clasp broke."
3,A light weight,"The necklace is fair. I was not that impressed. Although the price is relatively low, I think one could do better than this little number."
1,Think a second time.,"I would have given this ""book"" a negative star rating if it were possible. This pile of trash is as big a farce as the five so-called Illinois supreme court justices.To find out the REAL facts read the book called ""Think a Second Time"" by Dennis Prager."
1,"hello, informed consent??","Dr Moriarty was the child's psychologist. He was under 18 when the book was written. So presumably his parents gave consent for her to write this tell-all about his childhood experience and trauma. And she wrote it for her own benefit, clearly, making money from it, getting her name out there from the publication.What does the adult ""Baby Richard"" think of his story being out there in this fashion, written by the woman who said she was there to help him? Does she think he wouldn't care because he was a child?The accuracy and objectivity of this book is suspect, because the author - I believe - did not behave ETHICALLY. Even though she may have behaved within her legal rights."
1,Karen Moriarty's biases,"I think before people read this book they should be aware that this 'therapist' is hardly an impartial counselor. She had a strong anti-adoption bias from the start, so any testimony from her on how Baby Richard is doing is automatically suspect."
1,Cute but way too SMALL,"Like an idiot I ordered this and then read the review. Upon receiving this item I have to agree completely with the review. The locket is so small you can barely get your fingers on it to open it. Good luck finding a picture to fit in it. It's too small even for a passport photo. If you can find one to fit, you will need a magnifying glass just to see it. I had expected so much more from Amazon. Severely dissappointed."
1,As tiny as a finger nail,"I, too, foolishly didn't pay attention to the listed demensions or the reveiws.It's pretty but as tiny as your finger nail. And one would need a magnifying scope to view any pictures that would fit in this miniature locket."
3,Beware Kindle buyers,"Be advised the Kindle edition does not seem to be a pure text rendering, but a rather poor-looking scan of the original text that has been somehow digitized. Also, and this just seems sloppy to me, but the endnote numbers don't actually link to the endnotes. I'm also reading the Kindle version of a textbook by D.A. Carson and Douglas Moo right now, and it has linked endnotes. And yet this book does employ true page numbers. Seems inconsistent to me."
2,I had hoped for better,"I guess I was turned off by ""Brand Babble"" early in the book when Schultz and Schultz (whom I normally respect a great deal), perpetuated the myth that the Chevy Nova was a failure in Spanish-speaking countries.Please let's get it straight: General Motors did its homework. ""Nova"" means the same thing in Spanish that it does in English. ""No va"" for ""doesn't go"" is extremely bad Spanish. The Chevy Nova, as it was most places, was highly successful in Spanish-speaking countries.And interestingly, the point the Schultz's were making was how important it is to do research. Apparently, that didn't extend to themselves.In spite of that, there's lots of good rebuttals to the standard branding malarkey. Trouble is, in my view, they never succeeded in actually defining the term ""branding,"" and their suggestions on how to quantify a brand's value were too vague to be of use to me.So, disappointed, but not completely negative."
4,Insightful!,"Marketing consultants Don and Heidi Schultz present a plain-language deconstruction of branding jargon in this guide for executives who want to understand branding and build brands. The book's strength is its simplicity and clarity. At times, however, it reads like a series of articles that once were published separately, so that certain essential information is restated - often in virtually identical language. However, we find that the information in the book is valuable, as is the authors' thoughtful approach to branding. Their book merits a read by marketers and corporate decision makers."
4,Book: Christian by Degrees,"The original printing is out of print for some years now - almost a Rare Book - so I bought it used. To me, it is the definitive volume on the relationship between (European - specifically, British) Christianity, and the Masonic order. I gave it 4 stars because it's not a heavenly ""answers all my questions"" book - just a really good one."
5,Welcome back BASIA!!!!!!!,"This cd comprehensively rules. Sweeping arangements, clever lyrics and a deep appreciation for the humanity of their audience. This stuff is resonant--and one song, I NEVER MEANT TO, hits home with the force of a 7.0 temblor off the San Andreas.The return of the resplendent Basia certainly reinforces this album's hold on the grateful listener. But Basia does not carry this puppy--she sings background on a number of tracks that are excellent nonetheless (such as I Never Meant To).Still, this is the best thing I've listened to in a long time. Welcome back Matt Bianco--and welcome home Basia.Mike"
5,A Perfect Mood,"I own a number of ""classic"" Basia albums and thought I'd check out this CD based on the favorable reviews. Well, the 5-star reviews are right: This is light jazz close in style to The Sweetest Illusion, extremely well produced, interesting and meriting multiple listens. Standout tracks: Ordinary Day, Golden Days. That said, there's no weakness anywhere."
5,It's About Time!,"I just found out about this new Basia release accidently tonight and couldn't wait to rush here to Amazon and listen to sound samples. Much to my disappointment, they were not here. If you want to listen to sound samples from all the songs on this release, go to walmart.com, in the music dept. For some strange reason, they seem to have samples of new releases sooner than anyone else. Hope I have saved someone else a little disappointment. Now on the the new Bobby Caldwell CD samples........."
5,Basia finally returns!!,"Last week we were fortunate to see Basia and 'Matt Bianco' in concert in Alexandria, VA's small Birchmere venue. Although at first I had no idea what was going on and wondered who the 'other guys' were they certainly won me over! Some of the songs are classic Basia, and others infuse a style new to me. Listen to it a few times and you'll be hooked. I certainly hope this is only the new beginning for her and this group. She remarked as how she was very depressed after the deaths of her mother, cousin and sax player and resisted singing. Well, its a blessing she's back. I only hope that some of these songs get the play they deserve. Basia jest najlepsie!!!!!"
4,a dream come true,"From start to finish, this cd is fantastic. It's a relief to hear Basia back in business in such a top notch form. This will sound silly, but I gave this only 4 stars caz I just wish Basia had had more vocals (all due respect to the other guy =) Anyhow, BRAVO!"
3,"This CD is worth by Basia joining MB once again, and that's it!","I really like Matt Bianco, one of the best musical outfits of the 1980s... Still playing nice and smooth!!!However, in this 'Matt's Mood' CD, the only attraction is having Basia Trzetrzelewska joining her wonderful voice with MB once again, for just one extraordinary musical effort: ""La Luna"".The rest of songs is D.O.I.P.(= Dispose Of It Properly) filling..."
1,Some good questions but fraught with errors,"This book could be useful if it were better copy-edited. I am still trying to use it to study, but I am having to double-check a lot of the answers to questions. I just spent 10 minutes looking up the answers for Neuroanatomy questions 44-49. The answer page in the book says the answers should be D-A-B-C-E-F. According to my findings in the Blumenfeld ""Neuroanatomy Through Clinical Cases"" text and searching online, the correct answers are completely different: A-C-F-B-E-D.I use question books to study for exams because I find it a very time-efficient way to study right before an exam, but when the book is so poorly edited that it contains a large number of errors in the answer key, it ceases to be efficient."
1,Waste of time and money,"I bought this book thinking that there would be explanations for each question. This book is a complete joke. Only about a third of the questions have any sort of explanation at all. Many of the rest just give reference page numbers to other texts. A lot, however, just give credit for a slide and not even a reference. The minority that have any sort of explanation are very weak. This book does present questions comparable to the real exam, but if you want to know why an answer is right or wrong, I strongly suggest the Psarros/Moore review book instead."
2,This item DOA,"This item in ergonomically good. The function buttons are well placed, and the dial-face is easy to read. However, the case is cheap, quickly falls apart, and you'll end up replacing it soon. This one arrived defective out of the box. I noticed it reset itself back to the default date & time a couple times. Within two weeks, it finally reached a state in which none of the buttons worked at all. It had to be sent back, at my expense, and the seller didn't have a replacement in stock. Probably because they only had this defective one in the fist place."
3,I wouldn't give this as a gift,This bracelet is way to plain and bland for gift giving. It looks unfinished.
3,Lacking Flavor,This bracelet is way too boring. It looks like the designer ran out of ideas and then gave up.
3,Product specifications,"The bracelet looks beautiful and I am sure it is. I love sterling and white gold, BUT, I would like to see another important spec on the item....I would like to know the 'width' of the bracelet. It means alot to 'me', I don't like jewelry that is tooo big/wide, and I would prefer more than 1/16"" of a piece. I think it would be great to know the width of the piece also. Just my opinion. It could be possible that I did not notice the spec I was looking for to make up my mind.Thanks, Connie"
3,Worthy novel but erotic it isn't,"The author has an interesting premise, and readers of Auel's novels will enjoy it. But the sex scenes are nearly carbon copies of one another, and they have so little personailty for the most part that it is not exciting when the scenes finally do come. It is page after page of prehistoric life and the solving of a seeming murder, and a couple of accidents and woolly mammoths. The sex is mainly groping and over. I kept reding to see what would happen to skin, but Tooth and Bat were far more interesting characters, and Wolf, though why she had to be a midget I have no idea and everyone's motivations, such as they were for Neanderthals, were so simple as to be dull. Not even sex drove them. Very long winded and would have benefitted from a lot more dramatic tension. And a lot more variety."
1,"Good intentions, bad outcome!","This is a book that has a very interesting plot idea, but the author is just not able to execute it. The plot of the book is unnecessarily complicated and it drags. The author tries to make a set of complicated characters, yet she does not delve deep enough to fulfill this intent. Additionally, this is an erotic novel that leaves you feeling cold. The sex scenes are often juvenile or unfinished. It would have been best if this book had been allowed to develop either as a fantasy story or an erotic novel, but this amalgamation did not live up to its promise."
3,Don't be fooled...,"Don't let the 30 second audio samples fool you. They seem to emphasize only the percussion, and completely miss the unique and flavorful jazz/world elements of the Madrid collection.I was pleasantly surprised with Disc 1. The mix is very eclectic, with a range of influences from chill/lounge to euro-house to tribal/worldbeat. Expect to hear a few accents of flamenco guitar and loud trumpets, as well as upbeat flutes, jazzy piano, and both crooning and hip-hop sounding vocals.Disc 2, as mentioned by other reviews, was an immense disappointment for me personally. The overall style does not follow Afterdark's successful formula, but enters the realm of pure electronica. (In my own view, it certainly does not seem representative of Madrid. But then again, I've never been there.) If you're a fan of electronic/progessive music, I'd consider it a bonus. But even if you're looking for another taste of Afterdark, Madrid is still worth adding to your collection, if even as a 1-CD set."
1,2 great songs,"i was in best buy and grabbed a handful of cd's. i am usually picky about wasting money but felt like i wanted some fresh stuff.ananda and in my dreams are fantastic! as molly shannon from SNL would say, ""i love it, i love it, i love it!""the rest of the tracks are of no interest to me."
2,too bad...,"I was kinda looking forward to listening to Madrid. Disc 1 is okay not quite what I expected of a spanish inspired house, but still decent and enjoyable. Disc 2 is a total disaster, it's the type of house that I call ""overdone trash"". I started listening to the each of the tracks hoping to get some variation of the dull beat to no avail."
2,unsatisfying,"I hoped for insight, inspiration and guidance. I got some sursory information and no inspiration. This might be a good book for someone on the outside looking in. But if you are hoping for ways others have navigated this stressful time, this isn't it. If you are simply curious about different treatment approached and want to know what others have faced. Then, OK. But if you hope to learn how others have navigated these stormy waters and succeeded...this is very unsatisfying. Want to learn how to work together as a family? What you may need to do etc? forget it."
5,Great adapter,This larger end of this fits perfectly into the Jeep 2007 JKU antenna mount. The smaller end fit perfectly into my shorty antenna. Thanks!
5,The Greatest Baby Product We Didn't Receive,"We found these when our little guy was about three weeks old and we fell in love with them. For a Florida baby, the cotton knit is absolutely perfect. He prefers to have free hands so the fact that he can get his hands loose if he wants them or can keep them in the wrap when he doesn't, makes these a perfect way to swaddle him and avoid frustration on his part. Our little guy is a bit long, so we've moved him up to the large before he meets it weight wise.I particularly love the 'seatbelt' slot because it lets him keep his legs completely covered and be comfy, while also being safe in his car seat and stroller. I give these as gifts to anyone I know who is having a baby. I wish someone would have given them to us from the start."
4,SwaddleMe Cotton Blanket,This is an awesome product. I'm sure my sister-in-law will like it very much.
2,too small & hot,"My son was born at 6lb 10oz. This wrap was too small across the shoulders. He is a summer baby, and it is too hot. At the hospital, we discovered that most babies prefer swaddling with arms out, but this doesn't allow arms out. Glad I only have one - only used twice.Get BIG receiving blankets in cotton for better swaddling. 30x30"" is not big enough."
2,Not What I was looking for,"A friend gave us the fleece Kiddopotamus which we loved. I loved the idea of a cotton one because we had a summer baby and didn't want him to get too hot in the summertime. The cotton version stretches too much and our little one kicked himself out of it every night, so we ended up using the fleece ones afterall. He couldn't kick himself out of the fleece one because it didn't stretch like the cotton ones. :("
3,Should have looked at the size,I didn't realize how big this was untill I got it in the mail. I should have looked at the dimensions. Good product and it served its purpose (for a Halloween costume). It can in good condition and is actaully still (2 months later) fully inflated in our sons closet.
1,Not like the picture,"The product that arrived didn't look like the picture. What came in the mail had fake silver spikes. I was looking for an inflatable bat that looked like wood, but this wasn't it."
4,Mark Twain Rocks,"A fun, clever story that is a great read. The ending will get you! It'll make you smile, for sure!"
2,This is why real publishing won't die,"Twain was the one who said a sucker is born every minute, right? He would have loved this. People can now advertise and sell, to a number of suckers, things described as ""books"" that are nothing more than shoddy Xeroxes. As more and more real book publishers are driven out of business by people too greedy to pay for a real book with a hard cover we'll see more of this."
2,you have got to be kidding me!,"bought two of these for christmas gifts. what a joke, except that the joke is on me. i will be sending these back. high quality printing my ass. it looks like the typing from typing class in high school. glued together like a book report.shame."
5,Classic country and bluegrass music.,A great musican and singer whose songs are still sung by many a bluegrass artist. He had a great delivery and a style which will be copied for generations to come.
2,RAD,"Fan housing is too wide to fit inside my 16"" centered floor joist ceiling (14-1/2"" joist width opening). Didn't know this until it arrived and then had to pay for return shipping. All else about the fan looks to be five stars. Too bad someone missed highlighting the floor joist ceiling part as a potential issue."
1,Disappointment,I ordered this product but never actually got it. Almost a month after ordering this product they sent me a different one since the acutal one I wanted got damaged or something. Anyway I dont like and never use the one they sent me. I was pretty disappointed.
4,Good case,I bought this case for my father. He likes this case very much and he claimed that this case is very cute and perfect fit for his phone.
4,Snazzy!,"I love the shimmery, opalescent colors! It also fits just about perfectly, although I'm not sure the phone is slid all the way down in the back piece. There is a line of silver showing above the case on the back. I'm afraid to try to take it off and start over, though. It's not enough to really detract from the look, and it seems to fit perfectly on the keypad side. My least favorite thing is the matte finish, that gives it a little bit of a rough feel."
5,Excellent Product,"Product was fast; arrived in only 4 days. Cover is amazing, even though it shows a little bit of pink around here and there. Very durable since I have very little scratches and have been using it for nearly 3 weeks."
4,looks great!,"This worked great on my phone, unlike the other cover I bought. It is a little darker than it looks like it would be, but otherwise is a great addition to my razr"
5,Great way to protect your phone.,"I love this case. Not only is it a wonderful way to preserve your phone, but it looks cute! The colors actually do change with the light so it's always fun to see what color my phone is going to be!"
3,"Color isn't that great, but fits good","The color isn't really chameleon, but it fit ok. The only thing is that it doesn't completely cover the color of the phone, so if the colors don't match it looks really bad."
3,Phone cover,This particular cover is nice to show for as style and it protects from drops but it is not the easiest to get off and collects dust under the plate around the clock.
3,Quite Nice in Price and Color,"Nice unique color/chameleon and good price, would definitely buy this again if mine ever broke. I don't care much for the motorola phone that I have ( Razr) which is flawed, but till I go to a new carrier I will continue to use it and the case for it which does make it look pretty snazzy."
5,Super,It's a unique case but shows wear after a few months. Not bad for only a few dollars' purcahse!
2,Not that great...,"The color on it reminds me of that car paint color they used to use back in the 90s. It seems cheaply made, not very sturdy. If you want to protect your phone, go with something else. If all you are looking for is a new color on your phone, I guess it would work for that purpose."
3,Fairly Good Book,I found this book very helpful; however some of the maps were hard to read. More historical information on the maps and battles show in them would have made this book a must buy.
4,Biology by AGS publishing company,"A good Biology text to use with students who have reading difficulties. Since the book is ""basic"" I would encourage supplementing the material with online and other resources."
3,"Ehh, not so much.","Hasbro takes the easy, sloppy way once again. The idea of battle packs is great--some ""cannon fodder"" figures for less money and hassle than picking up additional carded figures. That said, Hasbro knows collectors buy these more than the kids, so why not throw us a bone? What you have here are two basic snowtroopers, 1 ""resculpted"" snowtrooper w/ cannon, and the probot, all of which have previously been available as carded figures. The General Veers figure was included in the AT-AT package. The accessories are minimal, as is the articulation of the figures, and there just isn't much excitement around the product. What if...they included a new sculpt of a snowtrooper? A super-articulated General Veers? A super-articulated probot? Some ""set pieces"", like equipment boxes, snow banks, etc.? There is a lot they could do with these sets to make them attractive and highly collectible, but sadly, that isn't the case here."
3,Hoth Battle=excellence,"Being an avid Star Wars fan and avid collector for more than 25 years........thats right 25 years!, this is an excellent choice for the new and old fans alike, priced seperately this would cost around forty five bucks. The detail is amazing, plenty of accesories .one thing though...they didnt give the third snow-trooper a blaster weapon!, otherwise a great toy+collectible even though rough handling might not be a good idea. until next time-MAKE MINE STAR WARS!!!!!"
2,Not recommended,Taking 12 years to make this it should have been a whole lot better. Looks like it was done in a day. Poor quality filming.
1,DVD did not work,This was a Christmas gift and I was so happy to find it on Amazon. The DVD did not work and apparently is not compatible with US players.
2,Sort of a violent Honey Boo Boo,"Two hours of watching what in America would be called White Trash slug each other and perpetuate a meaningless feud. It's depressing to watch and the film-maker, to his credit, expresses incredulity at his own interest in these people, who are not interesting. Then again, I did finish watching this.Also, these guys can't fight their way out of a paper bag. A 16 year old Golden Glover would make mincemeat out of any of them."
5,Wow It Brought Back Wonderful Memories of My Time In Italy,"I received this beautiful book as a gift and I proudly display it on my coffee table. My houseguests are speechless when they see the incredible photo layouts. Looking at this book makes my heart long for my next Italian vacation, don't buy this book if you can't resist the temptation to fly off to Italy on impulse after seeing the magnificent images of the Italian Countryside!"
1,DON'T BOTHER!,We were setting up my daughters new bike for Christmas and these things kept falling off and one just plain broke before we got the bike under the tree. Thank goodness we threw them away before my 5 year old saw.Not worth the frustration at any price.
1,Visually appealing but not worth the money.,"My daughter loved these but they are trash. They never fit in the handlebars & wont stay in no matter how hard or frequently we push them in. Instead she carries them with the Disney Princess bell, purchased with the same order & broke the first day, in the Disney Princess basket we also ordered. The basket has a laminated princess photo that has broken off on one side. Save you money & buy a Disney Princess bicycle instead. It probably cost just a little bit more."
2,Cute If It Fits,These were very cute but unfortunately they did not fit into the handlebars so they were unusable.
1,Cute but lasted one trip around the block..,"These streamers were adorable in theory, but fell apart in no time. Not worth the money or time it takes to put them on the bike."
2,Didnt last long,"This product didnt last very long, the streamers were falling out the same day my daughter starting riding her bike. Not very well made at all."
1,Worthless,"They came apart before I could get them out of the bag, extremely poor quality - I would have expected more from Disney..."
1,Pure TRASH! Make that pure CHEAP TRASH!,I should have paid attention to the other reviews!One of the items was broken upon arrival and it had nothing to do with poor packaging.The ENTIRE design and makeup is of POOR QUALITY.It reminds me of someting you might get in the Discard Bin at a Dollar Store!Very Very CHEAP in quality!The cheap plastic is brittle and breaks VERY EASILY.The streamers are tied onto a plastic post by only 3 thin strings!The other post is not at all designed properly to fit into the handlebar grips!Thoroughly disgusted by the CHEAP QUALITY in both design and manufacture of this item!Don't let the Disney name fool you like it did me!
2,DISAPPOINTING,THE STREAMERS WERE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO INSTALL AND HAVE REMAIN ON HANDLEBARS. ALSO ONE OF THE SPINNERS CAME OFF AND WE HAD A VERY HARD TIME TRYING TO GET IT BACK ON.
1,fell apart almost right away....,"Put these on my 4 year olds brand new scooter for her birthday, scooter tipped once and one of the streamers immediately broke. Scooter tipped the other way the other one broke. Maybe the plastic should be a little tougher since bikes and scooter do tip occasionally. Looked cute for a few minutes though!"
3,"OK, but!",The chord formation that come up are not the typical ones.. at least not the ones that I would normally use. Reading the disply is a little difficult too.
4,safe t shapes,"a little smaller then i thought,however you did get quiet a few with package. very easy to apply. stick well. i would buy more."
5,Outstanding wood boring bit,"Building an oak log home, needed a good bit to drill holes for wiring. I'd been using a Milwaukee bit with a single cutting edge and thought I'd give this a try...sure glad I did. Much faster and cleaner cut, goes through oak like it was soft pine."
2,Interesting but No One's Home!,"Don't buy this unless you are just curious. This was a fascinating read, discovered soon after my sister suffered a massive stroke. It offered about the only real hope apart from a miracle that I could uncover in my research on her behalf. I promised her that when she was stable enough to travel, I would take her to the 3-week clinic.However, when I tried to contact Dr. Hammesfahr and Clinic, it was impossible. Apparently the clinic is shut down and the Dr. not taking any calls nor responding to emails. I am curious--it sounded reasonable. Research on Quackwatch.com reveals that his claims about a Nobel prize are explained away, and the medical establishment considers his application of the TCD test not accepted protocol. So it had raised my hopes (and my sister's too) in a huge way because of reported anecdotal success rate-- only to discover the book is worthless, however interesting."
4,Very entertaining... Suprised to know she could write,"I too read the Senators Daughter first which prompted me to purchase her second book. I have been amazingly suprised at how well she wrote. Although either book may never be a #1 seller, both books were very entertaining and very fast reading. A great ""airplane"" or ""wasting a weekend"" away reading book."
5,Supreme interpretive scholarship,"Joseph Leo Koerner must rank as one of the most able and compelling figures writing in the field of Art History today. As with his previous work on Caspar David Friedrich this work is a masterpiece of interpretative criticism and research. Koerner proceeds always from close readings of individual works, but then sets them at the centre of a nexus of complex philosophical and socio historical questions. He invokes not only the writings of Durer's contemporaries, but such figures as Foucault and Adorno in drawing out the profoundest implications from the works cited. If proof were neeeded that art history can be urgent and disturbing rather than pedantic and arcane, then this book should offer it. As one reaches the end of this book one understands that the complex issues of identity which Durer and his circle grappled with are as vital and disturbing at the turn of the millenium as the were when Durer worked on the brink of the half millenium."
4,Death on Delivery,"I really like this series. Ms. Fairchild pulls you in with great characters, eerie happenings and frantic suspense! This is the third in a series. A great page turner, always with a surprise and often scarey ending(and a hint of romance). All the characters work together, each honored by Sal for their various specialties. Good lessons to learn along the way. Enjoy! Enjoy!"
3,"a mixed bag, but definately worth the read","A collection of holiday-theme science fiction/fantasy stories from well-known authors. Interesting spins on old themes and classics, though some are much better and more interesting than others. Grade: B+"
4,"1 cool film, 1 ""meh"" film","Worth seeking out if you're a fan of Brit horror or a Blob fan. ""X"" is a genuinely engaging film. No small feat since it's essentially a story about killer mud! Four-Sided Triangle isn't bad, but it's not great either. Think of it as an old school chick flick with sci-fi overtones.At least these Hammer double bill releases are on separate discs, not those crappy flipper disc jobs so many other outfits (cough*MGM*cough) are using for their double features. Video & audio quality on both are very good, especially for the ages of the respective films. At a hefty $23 the price of admission is rather steep, so do yourself a favor and snag a used copy ($15) like I did."
2,bw scottish/british blob movie: X-the unknown Y?...,"Lacks blob action: The show needed to show this radioactive-mud-blob MOST OF THE TIME someone approaches it/it approaches someone1 NOT LESS THAN HALF, otherwise only the last 30 or was it 20 or 17 mins. shows the blobthing and even those few,quick scenes r way too brief: just when u want to get into it. Because of this, this dvd is a ""2 or 3""; people shouldn't give 4's and ridiculus 5's. its nothing to rave on like that and its horribly too X-pensive - x the unknown y. if MORE ACTION ON THE ABOVE, I WOULD'VE GIVEN A 5"". they could've made a more fun movie on such a cool concept but no, again, what a waste of that!!!!!!!!!oh, 4 sided triangle-boring, 2.5"""
3,"Nice photos, OK text","An exhibit cataloge of spectacular black and white photographs featuring traditional Chinese houses in a few geographically diverse locations. The text is good for a general introduction to the subject, but provides just a few new insights to those familiar with the scholarly literature."
1,Great idea but Poorly made product,- 2 of the 3 wheels broke off after first trip to laundromat- metal coil already ripping through the red polyster hamper- tote strap very uncomfortable to carry a bag this large when full of clothes
1,Poor quality,Purchased two of these for my sons. The metal coil tore through the fabic within 3 weeks and the bottom panels with the wheels are falling off. Also the shoulder straps tore within 3 weeks and the hampers weren't even full!
2,"Decent job, but lacks in quality.","I'm a student in college, and when my first hamper ripped, I decided that it was time to buy a sturdier hamper. My roommate rarely does his laundry, so he has huge loads, but his hamper manages to carry it all. I saw the Whitney Design hamper online, which looked nearly identical to my roommate's hamper, so I bought it.When the hamper arrived, I put my clothes in it, and prepared to do laundry. The shoulder strap ripped right off. I didn't even fill up the hamper all the way, as is shown in the picture. Amazon sent me a replacement, but now I am afraid of using the shoulder strap again, and I have to awkwardly grasp the sides around the metal wires. This hamper may be able to function, but not well. And for a college student, this is definitely not sturdy enough."
3,"Ok, but can't handle as much as you'd think.","I bought one of these for each of my brothers as graduation gifts before they headed off to college. They're notorious for their ability to fill up a hamper quickly, and this looked like a nice, big, sturdy one to give them. After about a month, the metal coil on one of them began to pop out (granted he also usually threw a couple of pairs of sneakers in there too), and the shoulder strap started to tear. That one is pretty much done for now after a couple of months, so now they're using the other one. They say that the wheels are great for rolling it around campus, but the strap breaks too easily if used often, which kind of defeats the purpose. If you plan on filling this one to the brim every week, you might want to go with something sturdier. For casual use or lighter laundry loads, I'd say it'll work fine."
3,Broken after 6 months,"I purchased this hamper a year ago and it was broken after 6 months. The strap didn't break on mine, but the whole hamper started leaning to one side, to a point that if it's more than halfway full, it would not say up and fall down. Bad quality on this one, I'd stay away."
1,Disappointing,Bought this hamper on wheels as a replacement for my daughter in college. I could not find it at the store were we originally purchased the first hamper on wheels so I searched the internet. The very first time we put a load of clean clothes in this hamper for her to take back to OSU the nylon fabric ripped on the seam. I have emailed pictures back to company purchase came from and I have requested a full refund. Needless to say very disappointed with this purchase.Buckeye Mom
4,Great Hamper for My Purpose,"Bought two of these a while back. For heavy use I don't recommend, but for my purpose - storing clothes and wheeling them out to the laundry room - it works great. It's really easy to wheel and has the strap if there's something in the way. As long as you don't abuse it, it works fine. I'm ordering another one - one for clean clothes and one for dirty...because it works out so well. And I love the way it folds up and can be put out of the way!"
1,waste of money,"This book is so poorly written, full of typos and bad grammar-- it is impossible to read. The info is all common sense, but I only skimmed it before returning it. I'd skip this one and look for a better book on the subject."
5,The Best Compilation So Far,"Since Melissa's other gems like ""Better Days"" and ""For The Working Girl"" are still not available on CD here in the US (Japan yes but not the US?... go figure) this is a great compilation with songs from the aforementioned two albums as well as all of her other great songs. This CD is also from Japan but for some reason it is pretty easy to obtain at a decent price unlike the other two which sell for excessive amounts on Ebay. I guess my big question is why release these hard to find tunes on CD format in Japan and not in the US? ""Hello Arista"" there is a large group of folks like myself waiting for these CD's here in the US unless you prefer supporting the Japanese economy over that of the US of A?"
2,Faith without deeds is dead,"Oh, how lost for those who believe faith without works is salvation. Don't buy this book. Don't read this book, it will lost you to the depths of confusion.""Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who DOES THE WILL of my Father who is in heaven.""- Matthew 7:15-21""Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.'- Matthew 25:41-43""As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.""- James 2:26"
4,Good and practical,"This is a pretty good book on how to do door-to-door ""friendship"" evangelism. I used this as a text book in a Evangelism class that I took at Lee University, and greatly enjoyed it. The book is designed so you could take the information you learned in this book, and train others with it.My only complaint about the book is that it does not encourage people to be a little more aggressive in their presentation of the gospel. If one is not careful, and simply tried to use this book as the only method of presenting the gospel to sinners, then one could end up reducing the gospel to ""Jesus is my buddy, Jesus is my pal, Jesus makes me feel good.""I would recommend not using the outline for presenting the gospel very strictly, but simply as a basic template (which is good at incorperating all the basic elements of the gospel).Ultimately... my opinion is that this is a great book, and every church would do well to get this into the hands of their members."
2,Confrontational,"EE is a confrontational form of evangelism which many are not comfortable with. It works for some who impose it upon others as THE way to evangelize. Other forms include Intellectual Evangelism, Act 17 and 1 Peter 3:15: Invitational, John 4: Serving, Acts 9. Team Evangelism by Larry Gilbert gives a broader view of the different forms of evangelism."
3,"Useful, but not perfect.","EE will teach you to effectively, coherently explain the Gospel to someone else. However I believe that the presentation they promote, though good, is a bit grace heavy -- by that I mean that it starts telling the evangelee about God's grace before they understand why they need it. I recommend reading ""Hell's Best Kept Secret"" by Ray Comfort and incorporating his ideas into the EE presentation. You lose the benefit of having a canned Gospel presentation to learn, but you gain the benefit of a presentation that will help people to understand their need for Christ."
3,Adventures of Black Beauty season 2,"While this is a lovely old TV series, Season 2 does not star Judi Bowker as advertised. I purchased series 1 and 2 because I am a Judi Bowker fan. It's hard to say who is to blame for the bad information on this item. The artwork on the disc has a picture of Judi Bowker but doesn't mention her name anywhere on the outside of the case. Both series are advertised by Amazon as starring Judi Bowker. It's a nice enough series but still--where's Judi?"
1,Can't watch it,I can't watch this because it is a region that doesn't match my machine. I am so sick of these region errors. What a waste of money.
5,1 of THE BEST!,"Mark really did an, 'A+' job here and I can say that because I've read about 25 end-time books. His organization is just SUPERB and user-friendly. U can buy it here for just Ten dollars!I liked this book so much I'll probably buy copies for friends. Mark if u should read this, a personal thank u from me is in DEFINATE order."
5,The end of the world is a much discussed subject...,"but many authors have trouble putting into terms that the everyday non-Bible Scholar can understand with ease. Mark Hitchcock does just that. If you've asked it, it's probably in here. Hitchcock provides a Biblical basis for every provided answer, and has you more excited about the rapture by the time you reach the final pages than you have been before! Highly recommended."
4,CLARITY AND SIMPLE ANSWERS TO COMPLEX QUESTIONS,"I got a lot of good basic information about the ""end times"" from this book. It was simple to understand, gave plenty of biblical references, and the format was easy to follow. I will read others by this author."
5,Not your average film...,"For those of us who have been successfully curtailed by the media, with their hollywood plots to hypnotize and pacify us through mind-numbing movies and ""entertainment"".. and are now ready to be challeneged to think outside the box.. this film is for you!For those who have a passion for social justice, human rights, freedom of speech and questioning ""The Man"".. this film is for you!And for those of us who LOVE Hip-Hop.. who truly love it and believe in its purpose and artform; believe that is a vehicle for self expression and self exploration.. this film is definitely for you!I had the pleasure of not only viewing the film, but also had a small part in its production, and I must say, the heart, the passion and honesty of this film and its creation are evident not only in the topics discussed in the film but also in the honesty of Danny Hoch's performance.This film has surpassed ridiculous legal battles and is now being made available for all to enjoy. I recommend this film!!"
4,Works great,I have purchased a few foil cutters and while the design of this one looks a bit goofy and cumbersome it actually works great!
4,Cuts well - hard to keep positioned,"This device cuts very well when you can keep it positioned correctly. Takes a little dexterity and may get more difficult the more you use it ( in other words, like more challenging when opening the third bottle of wine for the night). Good value for the prince"
5,Works wonderfully!,"What can I say, it does exactly what it's supposed to do. Nice, simple, effective, and it feels sturdy.And safe -- even I haven't managed to hurt myself with it, something that I wish I could say the same for the little knife in my waiter's friend corkscrew. You'd be pretty hard pressed to cut yourself using this, a fact when considered along with the general awesomeness of the tool makes it unbeatable."
1,Leaves foil slivers all over,"This is the first foil cutter I ever bought.This product does cut the foil but in the process it leaves thin slivers of foil on your counter. I think the problem is that there are four cutting wheels. If they are not all aligned as you rotate the cutter, they cut different paths through the foil.I am concerned that some of these slivers (though only foil) may end up in someone's wine. So I won't be using this one. Back to the bad old knife trick!"
1,Broke with first use,"This product is absolutely terrible, the first use had 2 of the screws just fall out, the foil wasnt even close to being cut either. What a piece of junk and a complete rip off. Do not buy this product!To make things even worse, the company is requiring that I mail back their broken product to receive my $6 refund. Ridiculous. So after having to waste 30 mins to go to the store to get a wine opener after their product broke on first use, now I have to waste my time going to UPS as well?No one should ever order from this company, horrid customer service."
5,Livin' the high life,"I no longer allow foil to stand between me and less-cheap wine.I used to buy 2-buck-chuck (well now it's 2-fifty-buck-chuck) because it has that handy little pull-tab around the foil. Thanks to my Arch Foil Cutter, I have graduated to fine wines in the $5-$7 range, allowing me to choose the perfect vino to complement my Lean Cuisine."
4,"It works, it's functional, and it looks good.",I have used this for a couple of months and it works. The design has some draw backs that make it feel flimsy. I haven't found a way to cut the foil with one rotation; it takes at least two and often three. It is awkward to store since it's tall and will only stand upright. It's not bad but it's not the best foil cutter I've owned. Functional is the word I would use to describe it.
3,it works,"These things never seem to completely cut thru the foil - or I just don't have that perfect technique. I usually break these thing by using it to pry off the foil after cutting. The cutters break off. But, if I don't do that, it should last a while - just need good finger nails to finish the job."
3,"Good, but not as good as Pest Control & Organ Grinders","It is worth a read, but I would suggest Bill Fitzhugh's Pest Control or Organ Grinders over Cross Dressing. Both are very entertaining, original and seriously funny."
3,Good but not great,"There's a lot going on in this novel -- I'm surprised no one's turned it into a screenplay yet -- but while the plot is satisfying and there are a number of the jokes hit, the pacing and the characters are rough."
4,Cross Dressing,"Entertaining, funny, fastpaced. Ad agency hot shot, Dan, lends his priest twin brother, Michael, his wallet and insurance card so the priest can get medical treatment. Big glitch occurs when the priest dies and everyone thinks it's Dan who has passed away. Dan is not a likeable character and so far has no redeeming qualities with the exception he has paid for his Mom's (diagnosed as bipolar) treatment and nursing home care for years, in spite of her various hilarious and costly escapades. Actually, he is a really nasty guy who doesn't hesitate to steal a hit advertising idea from an underling so he can get all the credit and money. Now, to avoid being prosecuted for insurance fraud, Dan must pretend to be Father Michael for the next 7 years. In the mix is a nun with a shady past and a bulldog type insurance investigator."
5,"Fitzhugh shoots, he SCORES!","I've read Fitzhugh's other brilliantly inventive works and this latest maintains that breathless combination of hilarity, a compelling tale, and pointed social (and theological) satire. An ad guy posing as a Catholic priest? A nun who may be a... well read it and uncover all these juicy little delicacies yourself."
2,It's not bad . . . . but that's it,"Alas, to describe this book using a baseball metaphor would have it described as a popup single. Some of the situations are funny, but there's a lot of prose in between. Sorry, folks."
5,"A fun, great read!","This is my second Fitzhugh novel and boy, am I glad I stumbled across this irreverant novelist. This sometimes sad, sometimes slapstick novel was an absolute joy to read. Was the ending a bit too 'Hollywood?' Sure - what else would you expect out of this L.A. story?Other reviewers have expressed concern over the perceived 'anti-church' bias in the book. While I am not a Catholic, I am a devout Christian and I had no problem with the jabs and pokes at the Church bureaucracy. Every denomination and organization has people that forget what the goal is and are more concerned with maintaining power and status and control than with the mission. I have no problem with anyone gently reminding (or in this case, not-so-gently reminding) everyone to keep themselves focused."
3,Very funny--demerits for cheap shots,"I absolutely love Bill F's stuff, and this one is no exception. Plenty of laugh-out-loud action and a broad sweep satirizing all kinds of tempting targets. The cross-dressing idea (i.e. one guy dies and the survivor ""loses"" his life) is brilliant.This one would easily get 5 stars from me if it weren't for two shortcomings: I would have prefered a more respectful treatment of other's beliefs (particularly the Catholic church). Satire is one things, disrespect is another (btw, I am not, nor do I desire to be, a Catholic)--cheap shots are just that. Secondly, the book's editorializing on this subject did at times descend into preaching and amateur theologizing. That I could have done without.My misgivings aside, I got plenty of great laughs in. Stripped of ideological baggage and treated as a light read, this still earns the book a favorable rating!"
1,Barely worth the trouble,"The helpful content of this book would have made a very nice three-page pamphlet. However, that content is served up with innumerable anecdotes about the author's and her friends' Alaskan experiences (admittedly, some of these are amusing, instructive, or both) and shot through with conservative dogma that ranges from the vaguely discomfiting to the blatantly jingoistic. You're better off with . . . well, just about anything else."
1,Cheap Substitute.,The items I received were red white and blue. But do not look like the one pictured in the photo. The print is different and they are much smaller. It is a total misrepresentation to say that they are ADULT size. The one in the photo seems to be 23-30% larger. I ordered two. One had a large hole in it and was un-useable. BEWARE! You can get a similar float at the Dollar Tree for just over 99 cents.
4,"Wonderful book for beginers, wonderful Authoress.","I buy this book to give teens who ask me if I will teach them. It has nothing I feel I need to ""re teach"" them when they come of age, and I have met the authoress at a festival, and she is totaly personable and polite. Some authors are ""stars"" but she's a real as she apears in her book, and it's a good read no matter what your level."
5,Great source for any begginer!,"I bought this book when I had no idea of the existing of wicca and now I can say I'm SO into it. Amber K tells you all you need to know to get started in this magick path. The book is written in such a simple way, you will get involved with lessons of life and for sure they will give you a lot to think about."
5,Little book - HUGE amount of information!,"This book is just about the equivalent to a whole library of Magick related books. It may be compact but don't be fooled by it's size, it has an amazing amount of information. I am not a beginner in the field of Magick nor am I in the Wicca and Witchcraft fields but this book taught me things that even in my years of studying, did not. I recommend this book to all who are interested in learning about Magick and all it's different forms and shapes. Besides being an excellent information source, it's also just a plain-out great book! :)"
5,This was awesome!,"I thought this book was the best! being a teen, it was the perfect book for me to begin with. The writing is so good. Plus there are beginner spells too!!"
1,Not helpfull,It felt like she wrote a book and it was only 40 pages long and then wrote another300 pages to fill space. I do not need to be told to eat healthy sleep regularly and breath fresh air. EVRYONE KNOWS THIS. By the time I reached page 75 I realized even as a beginner I really did not learn a damn thing. A waste of time.
4,A nice starter book,"If your interested in the Craft and you don't want to spend too much money trying to decide whether it's right for you, then try this book. If you are already familiar with the Craft in any fashion, or if you are looking for a good spell book, this book is not for you.I bought this book early in my decision to investigate the Craft, but not until after I already bought and read Scott Cunningham's ""WICCA, The Guide for the Solidary Practitioner,"" so for me the book was OK, but not great.So, if you already know something about the Craft, look elsewhere, but if you are curious and have no background information on what Witchcraft is about, this is an excellent book for you."
3,first few chapters were good,I bought this book because I have an interest in the craft. The first 3 or 4 chapters were very interesting and exciting. Then I felt the book became very preachy and discouraging. I understand that any spiritual journey comes with responsibility but I feel that the internal and extenal changes in a person should come naturally. The way Amber K described all the things one would have to do in order to become a successful witch made me feel like giving up! It is true that a spiritual journey should last a lifetime but I did not enjoy feeling like it would take a lifetime to achieve any success. I felt the beginning of the book was very educational and the end was just depressing!
3,Jumps from one topic to another,"I have read at least 5 other ""beginner"" books before this one and I am not impressed with Amber K's work. To me it is too vague and jumps from one topic to another too much. It doesn't give enough information on how too, and it is kind of ""spacey"".... I am just a beginner (and I can't spell worth a flip) but I love to read, and I will read anything, this wouldn't be a good ""first book""."
3,A good place to start...,"This book is a really great place to start for beginners, but I found out after reading it that I'm not a beginner. I'm also not a Wiccan. This book glances over a lot of different topics and magical paths, but sadly focuses on Wiccan. It was, on the other hand, a good summary of magic, kind of like Cliff Notes for witches in training."
4,A Very Good Investment....,"This book is a great book for starters, and a great book to add to your library. Amber K gives some very good advice, and some wonderful historical facts too!"
2,there's much better out there,"This book was slightly better than some I've seen, in that it has some explanation of (one version of) magickal theory instead of just a list of spells. But Amber K, despite the references to other traditions, is very clearly a New Age style Wiccan. As a jumping-off point to New Age magick it's all right, but for a more thorough, practical and unviversal introduction, I'd reccomend Draja Mickaharic's ""The Practice of Magic"" a thousand times over this."
2,left me wanting,"This was my first Amber K. book, and because of it I nearly passed up other titles of hers. I have nothing bad to say but I found the book lacking, but for the price there are no complaints. If you do not care for this title, cont. to check her other titles out, don't rely on one title to judge, as I nearly did. You will miss out on some good stuff. Blessings Amber K."
3,"Magick, not wicca","This book form Amber K is about MAGICK and not wicca, Just keep that in mind. It's only 5 bucks, and you can't beat that with a stick, but it is just about magick."
2,True Magick,"it had good info, but not about the stuff i was looking for. if you want information on wicca then don't get this book, it has very little. it tells a lot about a bunch of american and foreign religions that deal with some sort of magick, but if youre looking for a sourcebook on wicca, this is not the one."
2,Fluff,"When I was bginning to study paganism, this book came highly reccommended, but I was terribly disappointed in it. All the ceremonial fluff becomes a smokescreen for a beginner, something to get caught up in instead of focusing on the philosophy behind it. It might be something to read froma library, but not with the money to buy."
2,"bunnies, light and buttercups...","This book tries, and fails, to fill a hole in the practice of many pagans, but instead ends up a shadow of what good magick books are. I really suggest a beginner in Magick start with the Kybalion (available free online all over the place) and Magick in Theory and Practice.EVEN Clifford Bias and Manley P. Hall, those (giggle) bastions (giggle) of Ceremonial Magick (giggle) are better for beginners than this.I felt this book over simplified Magick and talked down to the audience. Magick is not ""easy"" in many ways, and if you can't work though a Crowley book, should you bother manipulating your will to any effects other than education?In short: Too Easy, Too simple and not too useful."
3,Good book if you want a history of magick,"This will give you a good history lesson on magick, but does not do a good job on teaching you how to practise magick.If you wish to learn magick buy ""Wicca: A Guide For The Solitary Practitioner"" Scott Cunningham, then commit chapter 11 ""Magical techniques and exercizes"" to memory.Please E-mail me if you have questions or comments. Two BearsWah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
1,Boring,This book has very little to offer. It's under basic and contains almost nothing on Wicca. She just tries to explain a lot of stuff and it's not even interesting.Pretty boring .. it is only an introduction and she seems to think that wiccan rules apply for all kind of magicks
2,lacking readability,"this book had a lot of good facts and interesting points, but was not all that entertaining. I was hoping for some easier reading material that offered maybe some more beginner spells. I have never read any of her other stuff, but from this book I don't think I will"
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,WAST of money! Silver Ravenwolf is better! Her book is sexiest PERIOD! Wicca is not a sexiest religion! It is an earth religion male and female PERIOD! Even Amber K. Had a father?
2,Cheap quality,Save your money and get the better quality one. The blade on the sizing stick is not sharp enough to carve even soft blue wax. The ring sizes are soft plastic and bend and stretch when you try them on so you won't get an curate fit.
2,Can we believe them!,"A typical format from a journalist (science writer). Similar to the original ""Life at the Edge"" by Lewin, and the original book on ""Complexity"" by Waldrop. They just keep on telling us how important complexity science is, and how the world can no longer be run on the old mechanistic principles that got us this far. This line is so overused and boring. Wow; major insight from the authors: The world revolves around relationships. And finally, their narratives ( not case studies as they are careful to point out) are different accounts from Monsanto to Du Pont. Can we believe them? These stories hardly confirm anything about why complexity science is so important. But to be fair the authors admit this right up front when they say they are not trying to establish formal proof, but rather seek resonannce and verisimilitude as a source of validation, rather than validity. And for this honesty they get 2 stars not 1."
5,A delightful read!,"These authors have woven together a masterpiece that brings forth the importance of the new science of complexity in an understandable and practical way. They take us beyond where Margaret Wheatley invited us to ventured years ago, and support the importance of relationships as the basic unit of change. While the book is intended for business readers, it has application to therapists and anyone who is interested in genuine relationships, mutual respect and creative emergence of new ideas."
4,rasps/chisels,"I bought these for the rasps, which are fine, not for the chisel tips, which are crude (as you would expect for the price) but still can be useful for non-fussy purposes. Inexpensive and worth the price."
5,I absolutely LOVE this series!,I first read Frances's story when i was 12. My mom bought it and thought I might like it. I let it sit in my room for a couple months before finally getting around to reading it. I was immediately pulled in. As soon as I finished it I went out and bought the other three books and loved them all. This series is a very good read and is probably the reason I enjoy reading historical fiction so much. I'm 17 now but every now and then when I have nothing else to read I always go back to Frances's story. I highly recommend this series and believe everyone should give it a try!
4,really good!,"This is a really nice start to a really good series- about four orphaned sisters who live in the english countryside. Though this book starts out when the main character is only seven, the author shows a seven year-olds view without going into first person. A really great book."
2,Learn English,"For one, the gun doesnt shoot 380 fps. Secondly they spelled enhanced ""enchanced."" They may have even done this on purpose, seeing as you are taking a chance by buying the gun. It's about 50/50 whether or not the gun comes to you in working condition."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I was looking at an M4 and saw this one and the Well R6E M4A1 V2 and they are the same thing! just look at the pictures and compare they are EXACTLY the same!!!!! THIS GUN IS A RIP-OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,GUN DEFECTIVE...NO CUSTOMER SERVICE,"The gun did not work. When we emailed Hot Import Toys, they gave a suggestion on how to fix it. That didn't work. We emailed them asking for a new one. No response. We emailed them again, asking for a paid return label since we paid over $20 in shipping and handling. They told us to take it to Fed Ex and tell Fed Ex it was defective and that Fed Ex wouldn't charge shipping. Fed Ex doesnt work like that!! We called this company numerous times, left numerous messages...no return calls. We emailed Amazon and complained. Got a response from Amazon and had to pay over $19 out of pocket to send it back to Hot Imports. Amazon says they will credit our account. I strongly suggest to take your business elsewhere. No invoice was enclosed with the product. My sons friend also ordered from this company and the gun did not work either..."
1,DO NOT BUY... MONKEYS COULD MAKE A BETTER GUN,"My friend and I both bought this gun. We both charged it for the recommended time and it never worked. I could throw BB's with my toes faster than this if the gun worked on a good day. In ten minutes only 1 BB came out of the barrel and it just rolled out. It doesn't work, 'nuff said. All it's good for now is to be my back scratcher. Buy a pack of bendy straws to shoot BB's, they will work better than this gun. Thank you for your time. Good night"
5,"This Album ""HAS"" It All","If there's one thing I know - it's Country Music. I've participated in different ""Country"" bands since I was 16, and you can tell when someone is just singing, and when someone's got ""IT""! John W. Harrison's ""You Can Have It All"" is one of the best country albums I have listened to - and I listen to quite a few here at our Radio station at ITGM Radio. We received such an overwhelming response to John's New Album (in 1 Week); we decided to feature his album on our station and on our web-site. My favorite song on the Album is ""I'm Still Dancin'"". Every song has been masterfully tooled, with the highest sound quality money can buy. Believe me when I say - If you get this album - you'll be telling all your friends about it. It's Country Gospel with an anointing! Congrats to John an Barabara for their hard work on this project. Can't wait for the next one."
3,Mouthpiece brush handle broke on first use.,I can still use the mp brush even with the broken handle. Plastic snake is nicer than my old metal one.
4,"Monstrous thrash, hardcore, and metal","Combat Records rises from the ashes to resurrect their reputation for some of the best thrash and hardcore music in the business. At All Cost is just one of the three that were chosen, and they couldn't have made a better choice. Not only do you get monstrous thrash, hardcore, and metal music on this album, but the group also throws in death metal, prog-rock, modern rock, and the kitchen sink."
3,not as good,"I bought this album about a week ago and have listened to it a couple times and have come to the conclusion that this cd isn't as good as there previous cd ""the streets are alive"" but don't get me wrong this is still a good album to pick up and buy, I just prefer the earlier stuff 100x better"
2,.....,"you people like this? it's just a generic ""metalcore"" band who figured out how neat it sounds to turn autotune up all the way. nothing more. and the screamer sounds like an idiot-- he'd work in some kind of grindcore band or even with a sound that made his screams funny (i.e. diego's hot balloon ride), but that guy just takes himself way too seriously. this is meh, and that's all."
2,works but cheaply made,"I had a Ross root feed years ago that was all metal. It worked for a long time, but it broke a few years ago. I could not find a replacement in any local stores, but I found this online. Except for the metal stake that goes into the ground, this is all plastic and feels very cheap. If you put too much force on it while inserting it into the ground, it starts to leak around the handle. I doubt that it will last very long."
4,Almost like the old Ross 1200C but a little short,"I fully expected to get the same 1200C as the one I am replacing. I researched several websites to be sure I was getting what appeared to be the 1200C original design. However, I was disappointed to see the feeder is 2-3 inches shorter than the original 1200C; I am pretty picky about design specifics in tools. Unfortunately none of the websites actually stated how long the penetrating rod is, so I could not determine if this was original design or not. The head appears 99% accurate in regards to the one we have which is at least 10+ years old. I only hope it works as well, at least penetrating the soils at our small farm. I will update on how well it actually performs this spring in penetrating the soil."
4,Ross 1200C,"We have lived here 1 year - new home and we have planted over 50 trees. We had no idea that this year would be HOT and DRY! A hose with a sprayer or a sprinkler just was not doing it. Too much wasted water! After using this twice watering is still time consuming, but not so much wasted water. I am ordering another one and my wife and I can cut the job in half. Great water saver, puts the water where it is needed....."
4,Ross Root Feeded from Amazon,"This is a good root feeder. With the drought we had this year, I used it frequently for watering the trees. Don't buy the cheaper model. Although not indestructible, it is more durable. As usual,Amazon shipped in a timely manner which is greatly appreciated."
2,good concept...not heavy duty,While this works great....after my 3rd use of it..the hose attachment that threads onto the hose separated in half leaving me no way to attach it to my hose. I just bought 35 boxes of refills too that I found on clearance. This is clearly not a heavy duty tool so be be carefull.
1,"""Don't purchase this product""",The hose connector split during the first use of this product. It was not overtightened it simply split after being attached to the hose and water was turned on. Very poorly constructed.
3,"Really good, kind of Bad.","This book is really good in some areas, but weak in others. I got a pretty good understanding of the basics and some intermediate level aspects. But, some of lessons I completed and I did not know exactly what I did, and I even read over the hard parts more than once. There are actual typographical errors every now and then that I detected. It does give you a good feel for how somebody would use it in the real world however. I have not read any other After Effects books to compare it to."
4,"Tough program, good book","This program isn't user-friendly, and takes alot to master. This book does a good job at making you a master of the porgram. You have to stick with the book and program. An application like this won't be mastered in 24 hours. Good tips, and advice in the book."
1,"Oh, man....","is this book a waste of time - poorly written, shallow, bad examples, bad information. Why do they kill trees for this type of garbage?Don't waste your time with this book - read the manual instead! I wish I could rate this at less than one star...."
1,Found a major faux pas on first few pages!,"Kudos to Amazon.com for delivering Real World After Effects to my door in Hawaii within 4 days--Regular Mail! I was thrilled to get it until I read page 4 describing the main benefit from using After Effects.It says: "" Premiere only performs an AB roll (it can transition between Clip A and Clip B and then make the result the new Clip A so that you can add more footage). In After Effects, you can mix mutliple layers of video together or with still images and use them all at the same time.""What's said about Premiere is simply NOT TRUE! I've been using Premiere with multiple layers, multiple video tracks, all at the same time. It is very good, very clean and very easy to use.No, I haven't read the whole book, yet. But what does this do to credibility of the rest of the book? I hope to be enlightened with fantastic new techniques. I'll tell you know in a few weeks.Regards."
3,"""Lovely to look at, impossible to hold""","We love Fiesta and have been using it as our daily ware for years, but this teapot is one of a few Fiesta examples of form over function. The lines and design are classic Fiesta, but the function as a teapot is almost dangerous. The lid is ill-fitting and leaky, the impossible-to-hold handle gets hotter than the hinges of Hades, and the design engineer never gave this the final ""dribble-test"" in the field. It just doesn't work. Looks great on the shelf, but that's it."
3,"Nice, But No Masterpiece","This is a very god effort as boy band CDs go. The guys do a good job with about half the tracks, but there are a few that kind of drag down the feeling of CD and leave you wondering why they were chosen. Worth buying and definitely worth listening."
5,I LOVED IT!,I thought it was wonderful! I really thought it was good.They did great on the song This Gift. That was my favorite. I kind of like the Christmas CD a little better than the 98 degrees(and rising). They did really good.
3,Some vocals Lacking,"I felt that half of the songs on the album were of good quality. I have to criticize the rendition of ""The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting)"" for the bass singer's part. He was off-pitch and had the goofiest sound on that song. It almost sounded like he was singing his part as a joke to the other guys in the group. They'd be best to keep his voice subdued. They also put 2 versions of the same song ""This Gift"" on the album which weren't that different. It seems kind of a waste of the consumer's money to be duplicating songs. Overall, I would wait for this album to go half-off after Christmas before I'd spend the money again."
4,From What I have heard....good,Well since this just came out today I haven't heard a lot about it but from what I have heard pretty good.
5,AWESOME!,Hey Everyone! You should ALL go out and buy this cd! this a teriffic gift for anyone...even if its not christmas! it has awesome songs and the band is great! i Love them so much! I think you guys should try it out! Thanx!
2,A Musical Mistake,"I like 98*, and think their songs are great. I wish I'd listened to a sample of the Christmas CD before buying it though. Many of the traditional songs sound dull or simply distroyed by ""artistic liberties"" My advice to the fans of the current popular boy bands, get the NSYNC Christmas CD - a much better thing to spend your Christmas cash on."
5,One of my favorite Xmas CDs,"We have loads of Xmas CDs and this is one of 2 favorites to play during the holidays, including the NSync holiday CD. Macy's Dept store pipes in some songs from this CD as well as from the NSync album and it's very nice to hear it overhead while doing your holiday shopping. These boy bands may have dissolved but their music lives on - at least at Macy's and our home."
5,THIS CD IS THE BEST CHRISTMAS CD EVER!!!!!!,"I got this CD the first day it came out, and i have not listened to any other cd since i bought it, i am simple blown away at the wonderful lyrics to all the songs. 98 DEGREES IS THE BEST MUSIC GROUP IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!"
3,Buy this only if you liked their first album,"I just bought this CD and I have to say I am kind of disappointed with it. I was expecting a more traditional Christmas album but the music is sort of jazzy/R&B which I don't think worked well. It sounds a lot like their first album so if you didn't like that one, you may be disappointed. It doesn't sound anything like 98 Degrees and Rising. I give them 3 stars for trying at least! If you're looking for a good Christmas album try Harry Connick Jr's."
3,Christmas Album,"I'm not much of a 98 degrees fan, but i was sadly disapointed with their Christmas album. In some ways it was a nice cd, with the old tradional songs but after awhile they just get boring.Most of the songs are gloomy and slow, which in my opinion wouldn't put someone in the holiday spirit. I prefer to listen to something more jazzy for christmas. i loved 'N Sync's christmas album, but then again i like 'N Sync by far more than 98 degrees. Hopefully the guys of 98 degrees will come out with a better cd soon, to make up for their holiday album..."
1,Spend your money elsewhere!,Thank goodness I only borrowed this from a friend and didn't actually buy it! Spend you money on something more worthy!
2,Disappointing,"This Cd would have been better if there weren't so many old carols my parents used to sing! My favourites were:I'll Be Home For ChristmasThe Gift (Pop Version)Apart from those, this CD was really bad. Very disappointing 98 degrees, you could have done better you're a very talented band."
1,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH A CHRISTMAS ALBUM,"WHY! WHY! WHY! A CHRISTMAS ALBUM? I ALREADY HAD TOTAL HELL LISTENING TO 98 DEGRESS AND RISING, AND NOW I HAVE TO HEAR A CHRISTMAS ALBUM!"
3,Wasn't What I Expected,"I'm a 98 Degrees Fan, but I was greatly disapointed, because their Christmas Cd isn't that great. The only songs that I liked were This Gift, If Ever Day Could Be Christmas, and Ave Maria. I was expecting a lot more from 98 Degrees, and they should have more upbeat songs on the CD, and they should have taken notes from Nsync's Christmas Cd. If anyone really wants a good Christmas CD, I wouldn't recommend buying this Cd."
2,Horrible adaptations,"On the most part, the adaptations of christmas songs are unoriginal and uninspiring. There are only a few tracks that are good enough."
4,Tres bon!,"Wow! What an effort for a Christmas disc! I really liked the sound of this CD, sure there were a few tracks that were a bit bland, but overall is was cool. I bought this album, because I liked the other CDs by 98 Degrees, and wasn't expecting much from a Christmas CD. I changed my mind about that though! The highlights here are God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, which sounds like an old Chrismas carol, but it's very haunting and mysterious. I'll Be Home For Christmas is a nice a cappella rendition, and Ave Maria is done perfectly, and in Latin! Christmas Wish and This Gift, are the best on this album, they show a new side of 98 Degrees that we haven't seen so far, a more up beat sound. Very nice CD, even if you don't like christmas music."
3,La Historia de los Hermosillo,"Una muy interesante historia para aquellos que queremos conocer algo más de Torre Fuerte y los hermanos Hermosillo.Sin embargo el propósito último del libro no se alcanza plenamente por una narrativa limitada. La calidad de la historia se opaca, a momentos, por la narrativa del autor, quien no termina de darle el brillo adecuado a su historia.Espiritualmente hablando contiene un poderoso mensaje de salvación refrendado por el testimonio personal de Heriberto y lo vivido por su familia.Conmovedor en muchas pasajes, pero al mismo tiempo esquivo en otros.Por su carácter autobiográfico es rescatable, pero termina siendo poco desafiante."
1,Ghost 9.0 does not work very well especially firewire/usb drives,Man stay away from Ghost 9.0--u ought read the user forums.I did not think that Norton could be so bad.I am an experienced Tech-build my own PC's etc.IF u have any problems Norton telephone support is $30.So why should they make a decent product.HAve a western digital firewire-Ghost sees it until u rebootthen it does not see it. OS I follow instructions-hit f6 to load MFG. firewire drivers-ghost wants me to put my disk in a nonexistant drive A: (got a Laptop) with no option to change the drive letter to D: and as we all know most driver disks come in a CD or DVD format now..Dont expect any help at the Norton web site..Bad product stay away..
1,Entirely too mellow to be considered a rock album,"Don't let the other reviews fool you...they are being written by fans of Firehouse who have instituted a campaign on the Firehouse website to score points with the band. This album is TRULY mellow, including one song that you can waltz to. Try the downloads before you spend your money. I will add, however, that I do like it very much, but I was disappointed because I expected something at least SIMILAR to previous releases. It took me a while to get into this one. Try it before you buy it."
3,Decent album,"If you previously own a Firehouse album and you like it, you are very likely to like this one too. It sounds the same and the songs are of equal quality. The song Bringing Me Down has some irritably naive lyrics, but otherwise you can listen through the whole album humming along the tunes with a smile on your face. The band is not reinventing the wheel here, but it's a good addition to their catalog."
2,Another rocking hair band that doesn't rock anymore,"What happend to the firehouse of the early 90s? This group went from a once hard rocking band to putting out shlock like Category 5. If you are thinking about buying this because you enjoyed their earlier albums, be prepared to be dissapointed. It's a bunch of mellow rock that I would expect to hear on a radio station in a dentist's office. A station that plays Phil Collins, Sheryl Crow, and Bryan Adams."
4,I love it,"I have to admit, I had to listen to it a couple of times to get into some of the songs, but I do love it! The hidden track, Have Mercy, and If It Changes are my favorites! Listen to the tracks that are available online and see for yourself. After over a year, it's still in my 6-disk changer!"
2,Too soft,"Although there are some good ballads and mid-paced rock songs on this album, it is just way too soft. There isn't a single fast-paced, hard rocker on the album, and the ballads are all slow and mellow. Not one great power ballad, like ""Love of a Lifetime"" or ""When I Look Into Your Eyes"". I can not get into this album at all. Just stick with their older stuff."
3,Are you to old to party?,"DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN, You could party with the best and leave the whimps to rest. I was one of the best. Now A liquid lunch is a can of Ensure. But seriously this book brought back many a good times and many laughs. HOW TO REALLY PARTY. is filled with outrageous gags and the wackiest beer drinking games. It's a party just reading it."
1,Will the real Susie Raymond please stand up ....,"OK, so after reading and reviewing two other books from this author, 'Forbidden Fruit' and 'Taking Liberties' as blow out five star contemporary erotic specials there was no doubt that I had to get my hands on 'A Sporting Change' to see if we could get a 3 for 3 .....Sorry, this book deserves a rasberry! First of all I can't understand why the author picked a hockey team in the UK as being the 'scene' for this book ... she may as well have chosen the bobsledding team of Jamaica for all the hokey they play in the UK. Certainly from the get go it all appeared pretty unrealistic to me.The main character, Maggie, also seemed contrived except for the fact that she is a licentious slut that would really do anything for hockey tickets ....Seems like the author knocked this book out without much of the same thought and skill of her previous two books forgetting about the orginal purpose of eroticism to entice the reader to enjoy finish and the story ....."
5,"Welcome Back, Bangles!","I was happy to hear that the Bangles reunited to do a new song on this CD,""Get the Girl"" is the song. Buy the CD or Cassette because this is the only place to catch this new Bangles tune!"
5,Smashing Baby!,"THis is one of my best CD's in my collection! I cant say anything bad about it. Go ahead, buy it!"
5,What the first volume should have been!!!,"This soundtrack is what a soundtrack is supposed to be...music from the movie. All but two songs are directly from the movie, unlike the first volume to the Spy Who Shagged Me. All of the songs are by the original artist this time, instead of bad re-makes. What really surprised me was the addition of the song at the start of the movie, the bond-ish tune about Dr. Evil. It even has the music when Austin and Mini-me are fighting, with funny quotes by Fat Bastard. What a great soundtrack."
4,Repetitive but well researched,"Like the reviewers before me I found this work very repetitive and light in areas of Nazi attrocities. True, it discusses in overexacting detail the horrors inflicted upon the Jews but what about the non-Jewish children, Gypsies and others? Why have their voices gone unheard?The true picture of how the allies treated the refugees comes to light and will bring many to realize that the horrors of modern conflict are nothing more than mankind reliving the wrongs committed by those who came before us. Those that forget the past are condemned to repeat it!This work is somewhat confusing but filled with detail and is worth the effort to pick apart the excellent research within."
1,Smelt so strong,Smelt so strongly I couldn't use it - I had it hanging in my wardrobe for 2 minutes before the smell became overpowering - another product for the trash!
1,Bad out of the box,Upon receiving this light the bulb was broken in the box. I sent my daughter to pick up a new bulb while I installed the light. After installing the light and putting in a new bulb I turned on the light which flashed briefly and I heard a soft pop. The light would not work. I checked the wiring which was all good. I removed the lamp and tested the ballast which was open circuit. I pulled the cover off of the ballast and could see two resistors and a fuse that were all burned and black. I tested the wiring on my house and found nothing wrong there. I am sure that it was hooked up correct so that only leaves the light at fault. I don't know if this is just one bad unit or a whole batch was bad but I'm not buying another.Bob
3,These reviews are fishy,"I like Linda Sharp. I'm a big fan of her blog. But two of these ""customer reviews"" were written BY her ... about her own book. That I don't like."
2,A very mediocre product,"Well, I tried this one out when I saw it for $50/with free shipping! Unfortunately, the performance was quite poor, though. I think the video quality of the camera itself is good, but, by the time it's transmitted and received, the signal is barely usable. I found that I had to hold the camera right next to the receiver in order to receive a decent signal. If you move the camera even a few feet away, horizontal bars begin descending across the screen...And, the other problem is that, since it operates in the 2.4GHz band, most of your other wireless devices will be negatively affected. (For instance, it will ruin your wireless internet connection!)If you live in a place where 2.4GHz devices are not used - like a deserted island - you might be able to use this product, as long as you don't mind holding the tiny camera up against the receiver to get a decent signal!"
1,NOT A GOOD CAMERA,"Well this is just to let you know that this product is not good, it will work if you are 3 feet away from the receiver but when you install this in another room or 10 feet away signal is weak and is not clear on the TV.Please keep your money and try a cable camera, is old but better."
2,"Good camera, bad setup","I purchased this camera in the combo deal that gave you this camera and the swann microcam 4 they both work well and give a good picture, not to mention are incrediablly small. but the reciever often loses picture quality if the reciever is moved or the signal is interfiered with. I purchased this more expensive model because it said ""4 channel receiver can be easily connected ;to DVR, VCR, TV, LCD monitor or PC"" it does not connect to pc! when the box came in the mail it said ""Receiver can be easily connected to DVR, VCR, AV TV, AV Monitor (or PC with Capture Card)""i dont have a capture card and if i had known that i would not have purchased this unit."
1,STAY AWAY - DANGEROUSLY POOR BUILD QUALITY!,"Avoid this scooter -- and all Schwinn branded scooters made by Currie technologies -- at all costs. The build quality is horrifically bad. Out of the box, the wheel was not true and made the scooter wobble dangerously. Shortly thereafter, the throttle got stuck in the open position (and has remained that way) and caused serious injury to a child riding it who couldn't stop the scooter. It is virtually impossible to get through to Currie customer service (Schwinn doesn't even get involved), and once you do, the service is horrendous. Their response to being informed of the defective throttle and resulting injury was to tell me that I could purchase a new throttle for [...]. The worst quality product and customer service I have ever encountered. Don't let your kids near it."
4,gritty urban film,"A friend of mine who represents the film in foreign territories told me that I should take a peak at it. As a director of photography I have worked on numerous films. I was pleasantly surprised that this independent film was done so well. It was solid all around with great photography and direction. The cast had no ""name"" actors but they were solidly placed around a good sreenplay. The boxing flashback scenes presented in black and white gave the film a gritty feeling and filled in the storyline.My distributor friend informed me that this film has sold in over 30 foreign territories with many as theatrical releases. This is the type of film that should be in U.S. theaters instead of the junk Hollywood pushes on us. Great Indie film."
3,I enjoyed this vintage romance very much.,"This is the story of a young woman who travels to Yugoslavia and finds adventure when an earthquake destroys a nearby town. Sarah is a strong young woman who doesn't shy from hard work of any sort. Adam is a man who takes charge when there are tough times. These two often misunderstand each other and seem at cross purposes. I enjoyed this vintage romance very much.Illyrian Summer by Iris Danbury~ Harlequin Romance ~ 1965From the back cover....A mere infatuation, she told herself. Sarah's job as script girl for a film crew in Yugoslavia introduced her to exciting people- including Adam Thorne. She found his visit to the film site unaccountably disturbing. After he left, Sarah was sure her feeling for Adam had been only a foolish infatuation; he could never take her seriously. But when she heard of an earthquake in the area where he worked, she felt compelled to find him, to know he was safe. And that wasn't her only reason..."
3,Meh.,The book is a nice read aloud but goes absolutely nowhere. One really has to use all of the volumes in the series to NOT leave your story-time students with stink eye. In other news: The seller was rather late with getting it in the mail- even with express shipping.
1,Not Recommended,"The book has too much material, which mostly is useless. 592 pages of boring and exhausting suggestions that lead to nothing except somewhat improved ability to handle lengthy boring passages. Perhaps not completely bad afterall :-) The tests are too easy, esp math - I used to get the max. Makes you confident for a few minutes until Kaplan hands you your fanny with 600 written all over it. Verbal is not close to the Real GMAT. CR is screwed up - the logic does not go the right direction and several of my friends agree with me, it is not just me; SC is not focused on the style but rather on the grammar portion, which is not tested as strongly on the GMAT.And yes, the software is not something to be happy about. If you used this book and found it helpful, I will be very interested to hear about it.-Bogdan."
3,Ephemeral textural snacks,"CTK is a lot of mildly pleasing, but hardly spectacularly impressive, alternative electro-pop soundscapes."
5,Stunning,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but this album represents a mature, world-class talent at the top of her art -- a rich and beautiful recording with a stunning, timeless and timely selection of songs. Baez's voice is superb. Her soprano is strong, the lower register is rich and soulful. In short, she's a better singer than ever--and that's saying something given that she's considered to have one of the best voices of our time. Her interpretation of Dylan's ""Seven Curses"" is absolutely spell-binding in its beauty and pathos. Just one of many amazing examples on this CD. Anyone not familiar with her recent music needs to check this out. Highly recommended"
5,My Husband Loves This Brand of Peanuts...,As a southern-born boy my husband is pretty picky about his peanuts. When he discovered this brand he couldn't stop talking about the great taste. He was delighted to get these as a gift and can't wait to share them with everyone...he says they're the next best thing to fresh!
4,Excellent product,The peanuts are very large and tasty. My family loved them. Will definitely purchase again.
2,My Son Loves this DVD,My son loves this dvd. I on the other hand am not fond of it. Many of the cartoons on there are not in the best of shape for watcing cracks on the old film. It was a gift from my Mom so we watched it and my 5 year old son likes it that is all that matters.
5,Awesome,"Their first release was great and the second is better. Flowing from Jungle to drum'n'bass without a hitch, it's in constant rotation in my player. Liquid Sky puts out another great one! Check out track 5."
5,Que da base,and prepare the speakers daddy's got a new friend the neighbors gonna' hate. Just like all the jungle sky albums this CD's got Big BASE that will rattle anyone free. I bought this album in 2000 and I still love it. This musical masterpiece is pure genius for your kicks.
3,"Nice hose, not particularly kink-proof","I picked up one of these to use to fill the dog pools and various water bowls around the yard, and to water our vegetables. The idea is the hose doesn't have anything in the ingredients like lead or icky chemicals that can cause someone to get sick from drinking water. Little did I know that as a child, I drank a lot of lead with the water from the hose. My wife says that explains a lot of things, but...You can use a regular hose if you run it until the standing water is flushed out. This one is no worries and it was on sale. Two stars off because it kinks quite easily, so maybe thats what the lead and all the chemicals in the regular hoses help out with..."
1,Not worth it,"I normally trust Graco products, and even though I could only find one picture of this product, I bought it, trusting a good product coming from Graco! Not so.The 'blanket' that is rolled up inside a small pocket inside the 'boot' is actually a teeny strip of very thin fleece fabric, shaped in a triangle, that would probably only cover a preemie baby. Not even close to keeping them warm.The boot is a navy blue, elastic cover that goes over top the bottom half of the car seat, top half is completely left exposed. It is made out of crispy windbreaker material, not at all what I would consider baby friendly.I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Caution 2006 Honda Accord V6 owners,I bought this because the amazon part finder said it would fit my car. Beware if you have a 2006 Honda Accord V6. It is not exactly as long as the OEM filter. The OEM filter was snug and did not have any play in the filter box once seated. There is a little wiggle room now with this Fram filter. I will not be buying this one again.
1,Does not fit 2007 Acura TL,"I am sure product is OK. However, I rated it low because contrary to information provided by Fram, the Fram CA9600 DOES NOT fit the 2007 Acura TL. This product has 4 perfect rectangular corners. However, the original air filter has one corner cut off diagonally, about an inch deep. Look at your original filter or at the the shape of K & N 33-2379 on Amazon's Website to see what I mean."
5,Most wonderfully folded piece of paper,I had spent a good 8 minutes searching for this filter across the whole internet.When it arrived and I first opened the box I felt like I was a 7 and 3/4 year old boy on Christmas.I immediately dropped everything in my arms and went to my car to replace it.There aren't enough stars to give this product the rating it deserves.P.S. You don't rate a car part down because it's the wrong size. There is nothing wrong with the product. You should rate down the person who with one blood shot eye at 6:40 AM checked extra boxes.
2,ranting,this book is interesting but filled with lots of jargon. cut through the jargon and you'll enjoy what it has in store
2,Would Pass On this Item,"I bought this because my friend owned it and it worked good for her. Mine came and sometimes maybe 2 out of the 200 pictures I shot that day turn out corrupted. It just states ""Corrupted File"" with a little thumbnail of the picture. That can be a big deal if it's an important picture. I had a SanDisk and had absolutely no problems with that except that when it was getting full it took longer to load. Nevermind that, just pay a little more for a more reputable brand."
1,"Low Price, Low Quality, No Technical Support","This Transcend 2GB, 120x has not failed yet, but the Transcend 2GB 80x CF card that I purchased a month earlier failed and I lost some very important images. I was using it in my Canon 30D. I tried several different Software Recovery programs to retreive the images and none of them worked. I have tried to contact Transcend Technical Support through their website but they failed to respond. I do not recommend Transcend CF cards. This experience has taught me to pay a little more and stick with the proven brands, Sandisk, Lexar and Kingston."
2,Gives ERROR,"I bought this card reading the mixed reviews here, for the faster speed and seeing the cheaper option. I am getting ""card error"" in between images, probably loosing them.I earsed all and tried again, but same problem. I have kingston 2 gb and no problem with that. Not recommended."
1,warning,"all the performances on this cd are too slick.this is jimmy rodgers the successful showman.his tone is way too happy and insincere.i wish i never heard this cd, it almost ruins jimmy rodgers for me."
4,fantastic book,really good book with beautiful photos. great tips especially on how you can make the canapes in advance instead of slaving on the actual day of the party!highly recommend this book!
1,don't buy for Miri,"This was slightly disappointing for me. I was expecting a CD to showcase Miri Ben-Ari's style and showmanship, instead I got a CD overpowered by the mixer screaming over the music. And, you don't get full songs except a few. Most are just snippets with the mixer giving shout-outs or advertising his own skills."
3,Great observations; lifeless humour,"Simply put, the book is filled with excellent methods for creating comedy. If you do not have strong comedic instinct, your results will be formulaic. The author comes from a background of cheap laughs and sitcoms like Married With Children. The jokes inside are corny at best. While Vorhaus isn't particularly funny himself, he does have a good eye for what makes a joke funny. If you have a facility towards joke writing, this book will help you perfect your art; but don't look for laughs inside the book because they just aren't there."
4,Great book for the price!,"I bought a few books on comedy after a lot of researching, and the first thing I have to say about this book is I'm pretty impressed.You get a lot of laughs for the money, and some hints on making your own humor as well. But, if you had the cash, Stanley Lyndon's How to be Funny! at howtobefunny.net is the best buy for $49, as that tells you the complete techniques of generating humor.Nevertheless, I greatly recommend this book for all those on a budget as this provides good hints on the humor techniques and at the same time providing great laughs for the time you are reading the book.I give it 4/5."
4,Almost Creepy,"I have been doing some of my own writing but I've never read a book about organizing jokes, or ever cared about those books. A play writer talked me into reading ""The Comic Tool box"", and it was more then a little odd to have my jokes explained and defined. John Vorhans book has been great for new ideas, along with new ways to arrang humor in my writing."
5,Essential structure. Must read for comic experts and novice.,"This book is worth buying even just for chapter seven. His structure tools will break you out of any story block. Yes, the book is a bit stilted in parts. And he way overdoes the political correctness crap. But it was written at the hight of the political correctness fad. (Thank god that's over!)GET THIS BOOK. You won't regret it."
1,Not a comic toolbox!,If you can get past the first 191 pages then the last page is great....its the page when you can close the book and thank god its over.John Vorhaus gets confused with what a premise is and what most comics call a mix or a twist. If he is unsure of the basics maybe a book is beyond him.In saying this its worth reading as it is a great tool for learning to push on no matter how bad things are.
5,Just half of the book is more than what I paid for,"I have read only half of the book so far and I had to write a review. I do not care if the rest of the book is all crap, because I have already got more than what I paid for. This book is writing comedy broken to the bones. The tools are very simple and efficient to build comic characters, comic stories,etc. Also his chapter on comic throughline is just amazing. In a nutshell, this book is really great, for the lack of better word and buy it without a second thought."
4,Not what I expected... but GOOD!,"When I bought this book, I expected it to teach me how to be funny. I can tell it's not what it teaches. This book shows you how to elaborate a good causality of ideas that in the end, could be funny. I have noticed that people around me are indeed laughing more and I have discovered many psychological ""tendencies"" that are very related to comedy. So, the book promises it will teach you how to become funny, but in the end it teaches you how important stories and context is to communicating ideas. I'm 4-staring just because my expectation was not entirely met but the book is entirely worth it. It's a journey anyone who wants to write and tell stories (could be jokes or not) need to read."
3,More analytical than actual tools.,"Mr. Vorhaus's real tool (if you'll excuse the expression) is that he's very good at analysis. This book does a broad sweep of some classic old sitcoms and screen plays or `telling of stories' as he puts it. He analyses what's been done and then says to the reader `now you do that'. I know from teaching joke writing myself that some students need more than that, hence the mixed reviews. An interesting book but his approach is very academic."
2,"Buy ""The Comedy Bible"" Instead","An okay book (I guess) for aspiring sitcom writers and that's about it. TheComedy Bible covers a lot more ground(genres, etc) with many more useful tech-niques, examples, and tips. As othershave noted, Vorhaus is about as funnyas Norm Crosby. Buy The Comedy Bible (andno, I am not related to the author). Anyone who says this is the best book theyhave read on comedic writing must haveread only this one. It's WAY down mylist."
2,Songs to short,"Songs were way to short. Thirty seconds for sting, NWO Wolfpack, and goldberg music. Music was good but like I said too short."
1,Save your money & buy something else,"By far, this has to be one of the crappiest wrestling soundtracks around. The thing that I hate the most is whoever made this soundtrack put background noise from a crowd & the commentators are in the theme songs. That is totally stupid. This was a waste of money. A soundtrack should have the theme songs as it was made originally without commentary or the sound of a crowd cheering. I was disappointed also that the theme songs were not very long either. Most of the WWE theme songs run close to three minutes. These ran for a little over a minute."
2,limp and kid do much beter stuff,"this cd ok the best tracks are icp, metallica primer 55,megadeth<cypress hill and slayer. the kid rock and limp bizkit tracks are ok but thay do much beter stuff"
3,A good first try,"I have to admit when hearing other cds featuring themes I have liked the fact that they were just that the themes with no extra non-sense I have mixed feelings about some of the music and I am a hard core wcw enthusiast Although I love limp bizkit and ICP and alot of the performers on the cd I bought it for the wcw themes like sting, hogan,ddp,and so on I was hoping for alot of themes like Rey Mysterio's old theme and maybe somemore NWO stuff I don't know just more themes with out live background noise. (although some of it was fun like I said mixed feelings) the original WCW cd (now to rare to come by) had this down if it's not broke why fix it"
1,This isn't as good as it may seem,"This CD is far less quality than the WWF CD. The entrance themes are only about a minute long, and they're nothing buy recordings from Nitro. There's crowd and announcers, taken directly from Nitro."
2,3 good songs and thats it?!?,"I was a WCW fan all my life.I teethed on WCW.So when they brought out Mayhem I said ""Yes WCW finally has a CD out"".So needless to say...I bought it.DISSAPOINTMEN!!!That one word is all I can say about the album as a whole...except this:The wrestling themes are only about a minute or less long.Metallica,Megadeath and Kid Rock are the only ones that brought anything to the table that's good.This album would have been a heel of a lot better if they had had the wrestler's themes in thier full length.Also if Tony and Bobby had not been talking during the themes .ALSO if all the other non-theme songs had been worth the paper that thier titles are written on.Thank you"
4,WCW mayhem,"Being someone that has heard it, you will love it, from hearing DDP's song to hearing Wolfpac to hearing Curt Henning's ""Rap is crap""It is one that you cannot deny."
1,The Name Says It All!,"I have to say I was rather disappointed with the music on this album. I was expecting to hear just the entrance themes, similar to the WWF CD. Instead, you hear the announcers chit-chatting and a lot of background noise from the fans. The main reason I purchased this CD was for the ""Wolfpac""/Kevin Nash theme. I am sorry to say it was overshadowed by noise AND cut short. If you are expecting ""clean"" music tracks, you won't find it on this album."
2,WCW Sucks,"I didnt think it was possible to do worse than ""Slam Jam Vol 1"" but WCW proved me wrong. The best songs are cut short and Hogans even as ring announcers talking throughout the whole thing. Then there are tracks like ""get him in the corner"" and ""count that man out"" which are only 5 seconds long and pointless. Did they really expect to launch a music platform with relaese like this?"
3,Is That All People Care About Is Themes?,"Alright, I've seen these reviews for this, and yes it bothers me too that the themes are not studio and long perfect but this CD as some good songs. Megadeath, Metallica, Kid Rock, Slayer, and Primer 55 are my favorites of all. I hate most of the rap songs cause I don't listen to rap that much outside of Eminem. Complain all you want about the themes but how about you listen to the WHOLE CD for a change."
3,IT's ok its not a rush out a get off the shelf,well to start off with its problems start with the commentary of tony schivone or mean gene on every WCW theme and ddp's cuts off after baout 30 seconds and stings after about a min BUT the other songs are awesome metallicas live version of seek and destroy YEAH to me enough to buy this CD :)
2,Announcers talking during the music?! WTF?!,"Not a good cd at all. First off there are only a few good songs West Texas Rednecks,Buff Bagwell and Hogan's American Made. Second, Bobby Heenan and Tony Jabronie talk during the songs so you can't really hear the music. And third, most of the remixes suck. If you want real entrance music bet ECW Extreme Music Vol. 1, ECW Anarchy Rocks and WWE Anthology. Save your money because WCW is as dead as most of these songs."
4,Great CD,"WCW Mayhem is one of the best cds I've got. The songs by Kid Rock, Metallica and others are great. The only bad thing is the wrestling themes are not full."
5,All songs are really good!,"I have to admit, my favorite song on here is ""Take It"" by ICP (Insane Clown Posse). This album features Metallica, ICP, Limp Bizkit, Everlast, Kid Rock, and all of the best wrestler themes. If you like the hard rock, this is a great cd for you, so go buy it!"
3,Good except for the rap garbage,"Great artists on here we get Slayer, Metallica, and Megadeth on one CD that alone is worth the price. But we also get some great theme music from our fav WCW stars and some rap garbage which takes away from the album. Over all 3 stars becasue of the rap garbage."
2,Not even made for Wrestling Fans,"If your looking to buy some Clear and Complete Wrestling Themes like Randy Savage,Hulk Hogan,nWo Wolfpack.Then this CD is not it!It does have it on their but each officail Wrestlers entrance is only 1:00 long thats it!Its not even complete.But they have some Themes from other Artists and were never used,like some from Kid Rock and Limp bizkit (which both suck hard time)I was hoping for some Wrestlers themes like Erenst Miller,Lex Luger.The only CLEAR and Complete Wrestlers themes are the following *Sting - Seek and Destroy *Creative Control - Loose (Very cool) *Vampiro OLD - Take it (ICP also very cool) *Terry Funk - Fist Full *KonnanThats it,everything else on the CD Sucks.Please dont get this CD and wait until WCW can come out with WCW The Music vol 1,because I cant handle this.Whats next Backstreet boys?HELL NO!Save Your Money on this one,this was NOT made for wrestling fans,trust me"
2,WCW Mayhem-What a dissapointment,I got Mayhem primaraly for the Wrestlers themes. All of them are poorly edited. Having heard most of them complete I could hear the edits. There is some good songs on the Cd...Crush Em from Megadeth and Seek & Destroy from metallica save me from giveing it 0 stars. You would think that with 3 WWF CDs before Mayhem went in to production and all of them doing very well they would know what the Fans want in a wrestling CD
1,AWFUL!,"Absolutely terrible! The only reason why it got one star is because of Metallica. The CD Exchange by my house wo't even buy it back from me! Just as in wrestling, the WCW copies the WWF and they do a terrible job! Being a Jericholic I will never EEEEEEEEEEEEVER buy another WCW CD AGAIN!"
1,"Good for rock/alternative music fans,BAD for wrestling fans!","This CD is great if you buy it for the tracks from such performers as Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, but if you're a wrestling fan, as I am, it will be a huge disappointment. Most wrestling themes are under a minute and have commentary like on TV. Most of the wrestling themes on here could be found in better quality elsewhere on the internet. If you're buying this for the non-wrestling music, enjoy, but if your thinking of buying this because of the wrestling themes, I have one word for you: DON'T"
2,PRETTY BAD CD,I'm wcw 4 life but this cd was pretty bad the theme songs go for about 1 minute the only good songs are Crush Em' Seek and destroy and take it the rest are all bad. I suggest you dont buy this cd
5,People are crazy,"I read a bunch of review of people mad because after you play the game you know all the answers and you cant play it again. I tell you people are crazy. This CD comes with a total of 3 games. Each game takes about 40 minutes to play and we normally had about 10 to 15 people play the game. We had a total of 3 parties at our house and over 30 people in total played the game ( ONE game per night)- Try to entertain 30 people for this kind of money, you simply cant beat it.It's so much fun and easy to understand. Buy it, invite a bunch of your friends and enjoy. PS. after we played all the games last year, I gave it to my Brother and his wife, they loved it too."
1,This totally sucks.,"THere is literally nothing from the horror/action/sc-fi on this game so unless you watch crappy chick flicks you probally wont get many questions right. The main problem however is not the ganes content but it's performance. It constantly freezes when in the middle of a game which is beyond frustrating, the load times take forever, some of the rounds are braindead and pointless. I would not recommened this game to anyone if not just for the fact it locks-up every 4 out of 5 games, but the film styles it covers are pretty biased."
4,Shout! Family fun night,This is a really fun family game. Easy to work on DVD player and if you love movies or tv shows you will have a great time. A friend loaned me the first one and I bought more. Totally fun.
1,Too Small Too Fragile,I bought this for my son to bring clothes home from his dorm. I had it shipped directly to him and he came home the next week. It was already coming apart at the seams and the rods were poking through. It's really really small. The picture makes it look much bigger. It's probably worth the money but not the trouble of replacing it. I gave him my better one and now I am stuck with it.
5,colapsible hamper,I got this in 2008 and have used it straight thru to today (Jan 2012). The thing has held up great and still looks as good as new. I like that it is collapsible - helps save space.
1,not durable,"So far I have owned 2 of these (mesh and cloth). Both couldn't hold the metal part in. Broke right through it. There is a plastic thing that is supposed to hold that piece from sticking out, but in reality it does it's job only if you let the hamper stand and don't intend to carry cloth in it."
2,did not receive same hamper as advertised,"The hamper I received is smaller than the one shown in the ad and the opening is small because of the strange closure-also not shown-I needed the large opening dammit. I would not have bought this thing if I had seen the actual one I received. I thought your pop-up hamper would be bigger and better than the ones I've seen in Walmart but Walmart's pop-up hampers are better, bigger and cheaper.Seller, you are not being honest!"
2,disaponted,"the hampers were put in a large box with packing paper. but not rapped plastic, I felt that I was getting a use hamper, but it was new. I have bought hamper from another supplied and the came packed and better packed.rmf"
1,Weak Handle,"One of the handles broke off after only about five times carrying my clothes. It was pretty full, but for the price of this hamper I expected better quality."
5,Great!,"Cheap, does what it's meant to do. Has handled the abuse of many trips to the laundry room magnificently."
2,disappointment,The only good thing which occurred when I bought this item from Amazon was it arrived with in two days. I was quite disappointed when I opened the package only to find it was a typical pop-up hamper I could have bought anywhere in a store thus in the long run I ended up paying more for it. I wanted to buy a pop-up hamper with a lid that you can zip it to stay closed. This hamper lacks a lid so I reccomend if you're looking for the same thing not to buy it. If I had known it lacked a lid I would not have purchased the hamper. It's partially my own fault for not doing enough research about the product. I gave it two stars because it's still functional and sturdy.
1,Assault on the Environment!,"This hamper is okay, but Amazon was very irresposible in how they shipped it. I ordered four, and all four shipped the same day from the same warehouse. How did they arrive? In four giant shipping boxes; each one contained one hamper and about 3 cubic feet of air filled plastic bags! It took me 20 minutes just to break down the boxes and the plastic bags. I live in the city where recycling and trash space is scarce, and this really an insult to me and to the environment. There is nothing fragile about a compressed laundry hamper. According to the packing list, the shipping cost on each was $6, which means that due to Supersaver, Amazon was skinning their shareholders to the tune of $5 per hamper. Amazon, shame on you, you could have shipped all four in a large envelope!"
1,"junk junk junk junk don't buy, you can't return it","UNFORTUNATELY I purchased this item, and then I purchased it again thinking that two would serve my son's needs best. Well, they both fell apart within a couple of weeks under light and appropriate use. The wire at the bottom is protruding out two feet and has caused injury to the point of bleeding. I strongly recommend that you do not purchase. I previously bought a similar item from Ikea which lasted my son over two years of hard dorm use. I was hoping for the same durability from this item...NOT TO BE. I will be returning to Ikea."
3,"Good size, but doesn't hold up","Loved this hamper for the first 5 months, but after fairly light use, one of the thick metal rings that supports the bottom has worked a hole through the nylon casing, exposing a razor sharp edge. It's no longer usable."
1,Horrible!,I bought a couple of these at a store. I thought they would be better as I lug laundry up three flights of stairs. They are sturdy. The wire that goes around the top and bottom comes out and while it is not sharp it is strong and the material around the top and bottom is not strong enough to hold the metal in. Now I will have to go back to the other mesh ones I had. Buyer beware!
2,"Large and stable, but didn't last","Holds as much as a regular, tall Rubbermaid (non-collapsible) hamper. Worked great for 9 months (light/moderate use - I have 4 other hampers and this was part of the rotation) and the metal end of the spiral frame at the bottom must have broken free. So now there's a sharp piece of metal poking out of the nylon. Can't recommend this unless they improve the design so that it's more durable."
4,Thiner than expected,"I liked it but I expected a wider bag, it is cute, resistant but I am used to more room, this one doesn't fit as many clothes as my others."
3,"Good for college, not post-college","I used a hamper like this all throughout college because I liked the mesh, how easy it was to pack, etc. However, they seem to rip easily or the handle snaps off after about a year."
4,Shovel handle,"Shipping took a bit longer than I expected, and one of the two rivets was missing, but otherwise the product met all expectations. It is installed and the old shovel is like new again."
5,Neat gift for your man...,"My husband liked the scent and reccommended it to me... then when he opened it for his birthday, so did I! It has a great sporty scent but doen't reek like most men's spray plus all the things you get with it makes it a great gift for any guy!"
3,not for me,"Don't get me wrong. I'm sure if I was a doctor, biologist, or chemist of sorts, I might have enjoyed the book much more. However, I'm not any of those things, so this book, though very interesting at times, was on the whole a drag and I could have probably spent my time doing something else.My favorite essays were Puerperal Priority, Science Fictions, Call Me Madame, In Quest of Fleck, Losing a MASH. A lot of the essays I found dull or else I was too lazy to be as imaginative as Weissmann. Like I said, a person more attuned to his field of medecine might care to think about what he's saying while I just let it pass through unnoticed.Anyways, all in all, I must admit that the author is an excellent writer and his superior education in the sciences and humanities is evident from all of his writings."
2,Ehh...,"Seriously, you can do a Google search and find all of the same info on the web for free and more...."
4,Textbook quality,"I have not read all of this book yet, but I do intend to. This book would be very beneficial for students taking psychology. Personality Psychology delves deeply into the LifeTypes. It is also an excellent read for learning about friends, family, and just the random person off the street. I purchased this book to help with my Personality Psychology class and it did lend more information to assist me."
5,She Knows How to Get the Sale,"GenderSell is an OUTSTANDING resource for sales professionals who want to build their business! It clearly articulates the differences between the genders, and then translates them into specific recommendations for men selling to women and/or women selling to men. Judith Tingley's expertise as a psychologist makes her insights into how to motivate and and influence people very compelling. And her experience working with corporations seeking to boost their sales results make her suggestions very useful and ""field-friendly."" Gender-specific selling is one of the most important and relevant topics in Sales right now. EVERYONE needs to master these skills and this book is the quickest way to do it."
1,Stay away from this insult to Lightwave.,"Not only is this book the worst ever written on Lightwave, but is one of the worst computer books I've ever seen. There are a total of only 264 pages of 'tutorials' (and I use this term generously) that consist of loading models into lightwave, then doing bizarre things to them using Modeler's modifiers - useful things like make a woolly, furry triceratops or a warped, corroded Beethoven bust.Most of the remaining pages are devoted to selling other programs, such as Amorphium and Poser.It appears, when looking through this horrible book, that Shamms Mortier has spent a few moments playing around with the controls in Lightwave, then writting a quick knock-up manual telling what he discovered during those few moments of play.To buy this book would be a horrific waste of money, and an insult to one's intelligence.Actually, the best and most useful part of this book is the last 10 pages - they are completely blank."
2,This is an odd book,This is an odd book and not at all what the title might suggest. For learning Modeler there are some excellent free tutorials online (but unfortunately I discovered this only after buying this book). I did find the Amapi chapter and the overall concept of how Lightwave might integrate with other apps interesting (which is why I rated this book two stars instead of one).I enjoyed Mr. Mortier's book on Ray Dream 5 but this book should never have been published (judging from some of the comments in the book I don't even think Mr. Mortier likes Lightwave and that alone should have prevented this book from seeing the light of day). This book also has some of the most frightening-looking artwork I've ever seen in any 3D book. Hopefully no one who learns on this book will ever get hired to do anything I'll have to see!There are many other vastly superior books on Lightwave and some of the best stuff is freely available online.
1,Far Better Books Exist,"Shamms Mortier appears to be an expert in a whole host of packages, since he's written tutorial books for Lightwave, Poser, Bryce, Max, Pixels 3D and Amorphium.I've not yet had a chance to read this particular book, but based on his Poser and Bryce books, I will never buy another one by him again. Although the perception of ""good art"" is subjective, I think his work is extremely poor, and if you're looking for anything even vaguely photo-real, forget it.For Lightwave, stick with the books by Beck, Jerrard and Ablan.For Bryce, go with Susan Kitchens' Real World Bryce 4 - tons of really useful material."
1,Awful,"This book is terrible! Do not waste your money. The book tells you much less then the manuals that come with Lightwave. The artwork in the book look horrible, I was producing better models in the 4 first hours of using lightwave 4 years ago. This book is an insult to Lightwave users, dont waste your money the writer of this book obviously don't have a clue on using lw-modeler"
1,Horrendous Example of a How-To Book,"This book is nothing but an overview and the examples are so stupendous any modeler of any 3D program would not do as the author has as examples. The author has fallen far short of what the title and description purports. Just when his descriptions and content end in a boorish manner and perhaps to indulge further, the chapter ends! I would use more ""colorful metaphors"" to describe this book but heed my advice even if you are new to Lightwave--Don't buy this book!!!! That's right ""Newbie to LW""--you may be itching to get this book but it will burn a hole in your wallet and resoundingly disappoint you."
1,Is this a joke?,"This book is the only book in history that virtually guarantees that you will be a worse 3d artist after you read it.If distorting the Lightwave Cow for several hundred pages is your idea of modeling, then this book is for you.This book feels like it was written by a first time Lightwave user that loaded the Lightwave Cow model into a scene and started playing with each and every modeling control with no idea what they were doing.I actually think the cow could write a book on how she was abused in the making of this book and it would be more insightful to 3d modelers.Save your money."
1,Choose Dan Ablan's Titles and steer clear of this one!,"I am a lightwave 6.5 newbie user and bought this book hoping to be walked through the modeling process, as the title ""Modeling in Lightwave"" may inadvertantly lead you to beleive that this book will do. While there is a good introduction to Amapi 3D, if you have purchased this excellent piece of software you will already have the well written manual that accompanies it, and will find tutorials and explanations in there. I bought ""Modeling in Lightwave"" to learn how to model in Lightwave and would prefer to repeatedly review the documentation than to assume that this book will walk me through any of the steps to model in Lightwave in any way that is representative of this software's first class capabilities. I gave it one star because it includes a copy of an older version of Amapi.I simply didn't feel that there was alot of effort put int this book. For the time required to learn this program, spend it with ""Inside Lightwave""."
1,The Newtek manuals are better than this.,"After reveiving this book, I was disappointed. A third of it'scontents is on plug ins which is fine except most of the information is available on the net for free! Why bother learning functions of tools already covered in Newtek's manuals.Sorry Mr. Mortier try again. I am sure it is not easy to write a book on Lightwave and idea of brief tutorials is fine, but not at this price. Leave off the Plug ins, lower the price and rate the book strictly Beginner, then change the title to ""Intro to Lightwave Modeler"". Good luck on the next one."
2,A long time ago it would have been more useful,"I should have paid more attention to when this was created, very outdated in most aspects. At one time, I am sure it was great."
1,Never recieved this item,Since the day I ordered I have not recieved the item Thomas Guide 1999. I am very disatisfied because I sent them a email and never recieved a reply. I will never order from this seller ever again. If there were a 0 they would deserve it!
2,What happened????,First album very very good both voice and instrumentals. However this time round the voice was good but the instrumentals were dry and very dry and didn't do her voice justice at all making the songs...........just different. Nothing close to her first album. Hopefully she'll go back to her original style that we all came to know and love.
1,"Sorry, not the Cibelle I fell in love with in her 1st CD","Not sure what she is doing but this is so lackluster and boring, not anything like her first CD, her voice is still one of the finest new talents to come out in years, too bad this recent endeavor is so difficult to listen to, no energy, no zing no nuthin' sorry ;>)"
3,Not too bad...,"I was expecting a lot more from this CD after the self titled one but while this may be a worthwile buy it will take its time to work on you.Music wise her vocals have an upbeat feel to them and go well with the music, they kind of drift along. This is a great CD to have in your car on one of those warm days driving to work in the city.If you are looking for anything similar to Bebel Gilberto however, as I was you may be a little disappointed at first but I asure you, listen to it a few times it will grow on you."
5,Cibelle - The Shine Of Dried Electric Leaves,"Cibelle returns with her signature blend of Brazilian downtempo and electronic trickery on her second album, _The Shine of Dried Electric Leaves_. Right from the plucked guitar start of the delicate ""Green Grass,"" you know you're in for a treat. She brings poetry to her English lyrics -- listen to the rapturous ""Phoenix"" or quiet spoken word of ""Lembra"" -- and I imagine her Portugeuse vocals are just as striking. She is equally as adept at peppy pop, as well: ""London London"" is a burst of sunshine, while ""Esplendor"" is like a musical picnic. Cibelle's careful use of glitchy electronics and rock bombast delivers sonic interest. The staticky crackle on ""Por Tida a Minha Vida"" deepen what would have normally been a dreamy interlude, while the torch aspects of ""Train Station"" are tempered by the heavy guitar. The more cinematic ""Cajuina"" wraps up this rapturous album, one that bears repeated listens to grasp it fully."
2,It is not for orbital and lacrimal surgery - only intraocular surgery,"This book doesn't cover orbital and lacrimal endoscopic surgery - it is only about intraocular endoscopy. The title leads to a misunderstanding. However, for the matter to wich it proposes to cover, it is very illustrative.(sorry for any error in my words - english isn't my first language)"
5,Looking Forward Proves CSNY can still rock with the best,"After listening to Looking Forward for the first time I was utterly blown away. I was amazed how these four old men can still rock alomost fourty years after they started. Tracks like ""Looking Forward"" and ""Stand and Be Counted"" show classic CSNY while the great riffs of ""No Tears Left"" and ""Faith in Me"" show that CSNY can still rock. With songs written by all four members, this album is filled with diverse and great tracks and can be placed among the bands top albums. Neil Young and Stephen Stills provide terrific guitar work while Crosby and Nash harmonize like no other. This album is truly a must have for any fan of rock and roll."
3,"OK, but. . .","Honestly, it's not that bad. Honestly, it's not great. Neil's tunes are fine; Stills gets off some excellent licks; Nash, who I never liked that much, is surprisingly palatable and not too sentimental. Crosby's work, however, is not even comparable to his superb CPR discs, which all CSNY fans would do well to get into."
2,Looking Forward,When you go back many a year and you are used to Four Way Street and Deja Vu I dare say you are a little disappointed by this effort. I would say that the Neil Young tracks make the album. Sadly that is about it. Sorry guys because I was really looking forward to this release.
1,"These four fellows need to get a life, ""knock on wood""!","Well, it is good for a laugh. The singing is terrible and the lyrics are even more ridiculous. It is said that you stop growing emotionally the day you start drugs or alcohol. When you stop them you are at the same age emotionally you were the day you began. They prove it. Honestly, don't they have anything to sing about? Have they learned anything about people, politics, God,...just something. Deep down the whole thing is shallow. What a waste of money"
1,Soon to be the number one used CD,"Please take some good advice and do not buy this CD. I have read many conflicting reviews on this CD, but in my humble opinion, it is the worst CD I have bought this year. I have bought hundreds. The music is very outdated and the songs sound like demos. The leadoff track even tries to sound like Jimmy Buffett. It is just a bad CD. It is unfortunate but that is my opinion. I just have to figure out where to sell mine to get the most out of the CD. If anyone is interested, let me know, and I will be glad to find a reasonable price."
1,weak,"after listening to this cd, I put my $85.00 apiece concert tickets up for sale. I was hoping the tittle, looking forward, translanted into better songs not! I did injoy there other cd's and solo works."
1,Old guys snooze and lose.,"CSNY, why did they bother? Better to get a CD by an old guy who rocks, i.e. McGuinn BACK FROM RIO. Or Hillman's recent solo lp. Young by himself is okay, but this is nap time stuff."
4,"yada, yada",Can't miss the great voicings but lyrically the songs are not quite up to par...at least the level of what CSNY has produced in the past.
1,Time to hang it up!,"If the album title, ""Looking Forward"", was supposed to be a message, then I suppose that the message is that CSNY are hasbeens. Their once glorious harmonies are now merely average, their lyrical content re-canned leftovers, and the musicianship on some of the songs is truly awful! Skip this CD and get ""American Dream"" or ""Deja Vu"" instead!"
1,CSN try too hard--Y just does,"First, let me say that the members of CSNY are four of my favorite musicians. Between them, they have produced a remarkable collection of music; however, Looking Forward is not a very good album. It seems as if only Neil is writing songs to write songs. Crosby just needs to let his melodies flow and not try so hard with lyrics, Stills, a brilliant singer and musician, has become too macho and pc in his songwriting lately, and Nash isn't as self critical as he used to be. I guess that's the problem here. The songs just aren't very good. This group could have--and should have--done better. I'd say it's a step backwards from the abysmal American Dream. Ah, but I can still listen to my favorite album of all time, the second CSN album. It is brilliant! Stop trying so hard, fellas. And, Neil, you keep doing what you do. P.S. The most awesome concert I've ever attended was a Crosby/Nash show in Cleveland soon after Cros was released from prison. I still have goosebumps."
1,Big disappointment.,"The good thing about this CD was I got it as a gift and didn't waste my own money. Poor production quality, and elevator music songs sums up my thoughts. I can't believe that NY added his name and talents to this barker. The bad thing about this CD is that because it is a gift I can't give it to the kids and keep the spare jewel box. Save your money."
1,"There was no option for ""0 stars""","30 years after Deja Vu, this album should have been titled: ""Again?"" Proof positive that the media can sell anything it puts its mind to. This band is/was over and there was NO reason to try to put it back together. If you go back in history (or come from that history) and listen to CSN or Deja Vu, Stills' Manassas, anything Buffalo Springfield, The Hollies, The Byrds... THEN listen to the samples of this CD on Amazon.com (believe me, don't buy the CD), then the question that remains is not CSNY2K but CSNY2KY? Sorry guys, bad production doesn't make ""edge"" and sappy lyrics don't portray ""sincere"". Still trying to figure out which distortion pedal the producer ran the vocals through on Faith In Me. I guess I wasn't really freaked until I saw some of the names of the backup musicians and STILL couldn't figure out how this CD could be ""that"" bad. Whew!"
3,Good but not Great,"This album has received some pretty heavy criticism by many reviewers. After hearing the album myself I tended to agree, however with repeated playings the music started to grow on me. OK it isn't as good as their earlier stuff but it is Crosby Stills Nash and Young. Any group that has been making music for over 35 years will eventually struggle with new material. Look at Paul McCartney, Elton John, Led Zepplin, Pink Floyd etc - after 15 years, what did these guys release that was really good! The way I see it this album is GOOD but not GREAT which still makes it worth owning. Their musicianship and voices are spot on as usual. Personally my favourite track is a David Crosby song - ""Dream for him"". This song is right up there with his other great compositions. If you are a CSNY fan you should go ahead and buy this CD. Listen to it many times and I'm sure it will grow on you."
5,Can't get Enough!!,"Thank you for always coming thru with the music we love. This is a wonderful CD, we received it very quickly and love the music"
4,Better than the reviews,"I thought this was a risky purchase based on the reviews I had read here and elsewhere. Although Looking Forward does not approach the best of the works these guys have recorded, I think that any CSN/CSN&Y fans will be happy enough with this effort. Nothing struck me as among their best work, but I didn't find any tracks that I would classify among their biggest clunkers either. If their future work is this good, I'd be happy to continue to buy and enjoy it. It would be great if they could find truly inspiring material to record. These guys could make radio jingles or scales sound good, but I sure miss the great old stuff."
3,For The Diehard Only..,"This is not bad musically (how could anything by such musicians be horrible?), but it isn't remarkable at all.This is not even worthy of comparison with Deja Vu, and perhaps its not worth purchasing, though if you are a real CSNY fan, you might add it to your collection."
3,"Music, OK; Recording, Yech!","One thing that has improved immensely since the 60s is recording technology. What happened here? I like most of the music, but it sounds like its trapped in the speakers. No separation. I understand they produced it themselves. They should have spent more on the recording process."
2,Disappointing,"I bought the album because I have tickets to their February concert, knowing they would play some stuff from their latest release. I have listened to this once, and don't know if I will listen to it again. The sound is fuzzy, and the lyrics are.....well dumb. I hope they play more of their old stuff in concert, because I don't think I will stay for the whole concert if most of the songs are from this CD."
2,Saving their second best till last,"This was such a disappointment. After only three plays, I can now only come back to ""No Tears Left"" without cringing. Stills is the only one to come out of the whole sorry affair with credit intact - except for Crosby, whose harmonies are as mysterious and magical as ever. Crosby himself seems to have given up all his best stuff on CPR, which is fair enough (and the best evidence that any of the boys are really ""looking forward""). Sad to hear such lamentable contributions from Nash. As for Young, what a shocker: tired Harvest Moon rejects. It's all too reminiscent of American Dream for comfort. Hey ho, back to After the Storm to hear how the boys can perform."
3,......maybe it'll be like wine......,"...as someone who cannot put into words what Neil Young's music has made me feel over the last 20 years, and someone who saw Crosby's CPR show at the New England Aquarium two summers ago (which was freakin great, what with the penguins being totally mesmerized as well).....and a lifelong fan of Stills & Nash also.......I found this initially disappointing & weak.......if I want to be in the middle of someplace soft, I'll listen to ""Comes A Time"".....but I have listened to it only once, so maybe it'll appeal tome over time like Dewar's did.......but one thing I did expect was for Neil's material to make it listenable.......if he wasn't part of the project, I wouldn't have bought it......"
5,This is better than I thought it was going to be,"I admit, my expectations were not very high about these guys. First, they are old; Second, their last album wasn't all that good. But... this is a damn good CD. I'm still debating which track is my favorite. All four of them show superior songwriting abilities. Crosby's ""Dream For Him"" is a song and up there with his CPR stuff. Stills,in my opinion, shines on this album, especially with the loud ""No Tears Left."" That is probably my favorite track here. Nash could have been a bit better on this CD, but ""Heartland"" is definitly a good tune. Young here fits in here well and all of his songs are great, even the strange ""Queen of them All."" Well there you have it. Most of these songs should be good in concert when they tour. Definitly worth owning."
3,"They can do no wrong, but they can get old and tired.","The dynamics of this super group can be heard in the harmonies. The sense of ""Something Special"" can be felt in the spirit of the music . . . but these old fossils sound weak. They can do no wrong, though. They still represent an era, and a feeling of freedom that no one else can give you with their music."
2,Save your money,"If you're looking for more Deja Vu all over again, you'll be most disappointed. This wallet-liner has little to offer those of us who would normally be happy to shell out fifteen bucks just to hear these guys sing showtunes. It's mostly Neil Young and his crew with some fillers by CSN and theirs. Overall, a big let down - reminds me a bit of their tour (they did tour, didn't they?)."
4,Remember why you like these guys...,"Not every song is a home run, but what CD has? There's some nice stuff here (Looking Forward, Heartland, Sanibel, Dream For Him). I love all of these guys (Neil, you need to stop by more often). Bottom line... when I hear David, Stephen, Graham (and Neil) harmonize, I feel better - it's as simple as that. It's hard to put into words (anyone that follows CSNY knows what I'm taking about) - I have some sort of physical reaction to great harmonies. I read a review from some ""critic"" trying to analyze CSN&Y's longevity for the past 30 years with only a few albums. Clearly, he hasn't been touched by this convergence of three (four) voices into one fluid instrument. Hey guys, see you at Madison Sq Garden in April."
2,I'm really trying hard to love this album,No one loves these guys more than me. I have listened to this album about 15 times trying my hardest to love it. I don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings but I just didn't click with it. Neil Young is fantastic but the rest of the songs are a bit weak. I am looking forward to their next album and I will be seeing them in concert in Las Vegas which I wouldn't miss for the world.
3,No passion,"The harmonic voices in this album are lovely but, as one who remembers Deja Vu on day one of its release, if you compare the two collections you will clearly see that there is no passion here and now. These four men are, technically, extraordinarily capable, but they don't relate to each other personally any more."
2,old voices..the only fresh sound is young,i am a big csny fan but this album is a sad commentary on aging musicians trying to recapture the magic
1,How could they do this to us!,"Looking ForwardWhen I purchased this CD, I never even considered that it could be this bad. Imagine putting away a CSN and Y CD knowing it will never see daylight again. To make matters worse Nash says in a quote from one of their websites that they will play every song from this CD on their current Tour. If that happens I will be walking out on a concert that I have been dreaming of for 30 years. The tour is still months away, maybe by then they will know the truth."
3,Not quite there,"I must admit I have waited and waited for another CSNY effort. Well it is a bit disappointing. Reading up on some of the studio activity I was really looking forward to a project where they all actually agreed on 9 of the tracks. Probably should have stopped there. Perhaps what really makes their music magical is the tension that usually rips these guys apart such that we nary hear but an occasional track or two for several years. But I'll dive in again if they do release another CD next year, and I'll be seeing them live in February -- perhaps some of the old angst will have returned by then..."
3,Old Farts at Play,"You listen to this record waiting for something magical to happen. There's a little, but not much. Stills scores with the opening track, ""Faith in Me,"" which also does the most to revive the harmony angle. Young does well with his four tracks--reverting to the painfully intimate and poetically allusive style he perfected prior to Rust Never Sleeps. One of Crosby's songs, ""Dream for Him"" sounds interesting, updating his paranoid Byrds style from The Notorious Byrd Bros. The rest is dreck.You have to decide, is half an album of decent material, or really one-third of a new Neil Young album, worth the money. Probably. But if you want to hear and old rocker find his way with authority, save your money and buy Paul McCartney's truly awesome ""Run Devil Run."""
2,save your dough,"Icouldn't wait to hear the alblum and then couldn't wait for it to be over. Many of the songs sound like they were borrowed from another place and time, and from other artists !"
1,Very sleepy -- afraid these guys are past their prime!,"As a true blue, died-in-the-wool CSNY fan I ordered this sight unheard and am truly disappointed. Maybe it will grow on me but this is pretty tame stuff."
4,a surprisingly strong effort from all four members,"After several listenings this record has a nice flow to it. It starts off rather abruptly with Stills latin influenced ""Faith in Me"" which is not one of the best songs. In fact the record is quite balanced no duds but there's not a real ""killer"" cut either. Crosby's,""Dream for Him"",Young's,""Slowpoke"",Stills,""No tears left"" and Nash's ""Heartland"" are perhaps the best cuts. But the album is good,good songs,good harmonies,good vibes and a positive attitude toward the future."
3,Perfect audio wallpaper.,"I purchased this album with enthusiasm tempered with caution. The CSN&Y name carries with it so much potential, but at the same time I have read the not-so-sparkling reviews.At it's core, it's not a very bad album and yet not a very good one either. CSN(&Y)'s greatest asset has been it's vocal harmonies, and yet this is what is so obviously lacking in this effort. Rather than the songs being structured around the beautiful harmonies these four musicians can create, harmonies seemed to be added as an afterthought--almost in a backup-vocal utilization.Instead of a offering of songs from a solid core of four musicians working together, the album ultimately comes off as the work of four individuals who bring their separate songs to the table.Bottom line: disappointing for what could have been; good background music."
3,Some good songs and some not so good songs,"Better than American Dream and Live It Up, but not as strong as After The Storm. Of course it doesn't compare to their classic early stuff. It has some good songs and some junk. While ""Seen Enough"" is a pretty good tune, I am tired of Stills' preaching against the evil white man. Here's a news flash, their are good and bad people of every race and ethnic group! It's a pitty that a ""group"" that had such potential has turned into a tired parody of itself. CSN& (rarely) Y had the potential to become THE group of the 70s, but egos got in the way. Unfortunately instead of becoming the group, CSN&Y became a collection solo artists who got together once or twice a decade to give their solo careers a shot in the arm. What a sad legacy for a budding supergroup that produced standards like Crosby, Stills, and Nash (the first album) and Deja Vu."
2,Old Magic - NOT THERE,"As a fan of their earlier work, I was hoping to hear songs that contained the harmonies of ""Helplessly Hoping"" or the energy of ""Sweet Judy Blue Eyes."" Unfortunately, I found neither. In my opinion, Neil Young's diversion into Country Music forever changed him. Their were some faint moments when I thought the CD might shine, but it never happened. If your a fan of the old, don't look for it in this CD"
2,LOOKING FORWARD,ALMOST A TOTAL WASTE. A COUPLE OF GOOD TUNES BY NEIL YOUNG IS THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS ME FROM THROWING IT IN THE DUMPSTER BEHIND MY OFFICE. THE RECORDINGS I MADE 30 YEARS AGO ON 8 TRACK SOUNDED BETTER THAN THIS C.D. I LOANED IT TO A FRIEND AND HE BROUGHT IT BACK LAUGHING SAYING THAT HE WAS GLAD I SPENT MY MONEY ON THIS INSTEAD OF HIM! A BIG LET DOWN. I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED CSNY.
2,a sad effort,"I don`t know why neil young bothers with these dinasours,neil stills rocks but csn are a joke. about the only good song is slowspoke.don`t waste your money borrow it from a friend"
1,No stars for Old stars,"I can't give it a rating, but I will give it a 1 since I can't give it a 0. Its weak and anemic. Go buy anything by the Byrds, Bufallo Springfield, or Hollies. It will be better than this, I promise. All the hype on this and this is the best they can come up with? Weak lyrics, weak harmonies, silly songs. What a letdown."
4,Welcome Back!,"This is even better than American Dream, maybe not better than than Deja Vu, but what do you expect? I like Crosby's updated ""Almost Cut My Hair"". Be sure to catch them on the CSN&Y2K tour in Y2K! Rock and roll is still alive and well, thank you!"
4,I cant stop listening to this album---I need help,What a wonderful return album for CSN&Y- I cant stop listening to this record--It is now part of the Cd system in my car- I may have to be deprogramed in order for me to turn it off.
2,strange double feature,"This is a strange double feature. The Joan Fontaine movie is well made and has some very fine British actors in it. However, the story is ridiculous and totally unfrightening and even silly. The sight of Kay Walsh in full witch doctor regalia chanting mumbo jumbo is truly ridiculous. Prehistoric Women is totally inept and must have had a budget of about one hundred dollars. It doesnt even have the advantage of being camp."
5,Marvellous Michael,Michael Juniour is an amazing child singer. He has a beautiful voice and clear enunciation. He is a very intelligent and well mannered young boy.
5,old dalmatian language,"Excellent try ,a refreshing book on a subject long forgotten of a language that is still sounding in the streets of Dalmatian Croatia, dressed up in local lingo,but ...not complete.A remanent of a rich cultural past of Illyrian population on Adriatic islands."
1,Be careful,"... getting the promised rebate from Symantec takes sustained effort. You have to mail the stuff, you have to track you get a response, you have to re-send stuff when they say you haven't sent the right stuff (you have) within 7 days, etc. etc. It's a deceitful practice, I bet their marketeers are rewarded for LOW redemptions."
4,wow!,"Great tone, impeccable intonation. Very interesting selections, many of which I've never heard on bass trombone before. One of the warmest sounds I've ever heard. If you're a trombone player this is a must have."
5,The first Chesney to have a certain amount of SIZZLE!,"Marion Chesney has always written novels that were cute and humorous. The Savage Marquess is a novel that impressed upon me a change of heart. The actual Marquess in the book is a dashing rake just waiting for our darling Lucinda to reform him. She doesn't do it subtly, she literally goes for the lived-in effect. The poor marquess will never know what hit him. A definite favorite of mine with lots of added pizaz that has never before been seen in a Chesney romance novel."
3,Quality is good but size too big for me.,"This dress is nice, but the size is too big for me. We're asian just small build. It's too long.. Although is M size but seem like L size to me."
1,Racist&Wack,"where is R.kelly on here? He should have 4-5 titles in there. ""Off the wall&Thriller by Michael Jackson should be anywhere between 1-5 all-time easily instead of them calling him out of His name they need to give it up for his Impact.and Many Jazz Acts are missing.Personally I can Out write anything that racist Rolling stone puts out for Music.they still want to sell folks on the Rolling Stones,Beatles&Bob Dylan,but don't Properly come correct on Black Artists on a whole&I got a Problem with that&always will because the Truth needs to come on through."
3,Decent coffee-table book to browse through,"""...the essential guide to the best music of modern times from the world's greatest music magazine...""Absurd statement. Obviously, everyone will have his or her own opinions as to what constitutes the ""greatest"" (in what context?). Out of 500 selections I imagine we'd all find something we could agree upon. OK, hyperbole aside, this is a colorful coffee-table book worth thumbing through. Unless you're very young, it will also evoke memories of increasingly distant eras."
2,Eminently forgettable...A great doorstop or paperweight,"Let's not argue about matters of taste or position. They think Sgt. Pepper is #1, I don't. This enterprise is a $35 mistake. How could they include five or six albums by the Velvet Underground and only two by the Airplane and the Mamas and the Papas? And not even one by Neil Sedaka! Good production values except for the hard to read font in the index. Save the $35 and buy instead the New Rolling Stone Best Albums ($29.95 discounted). P.S. Raise your hand if you think The Who Sell Out is a better album than Tommy. The fools at Rolling Stone think so. P.P.S. If you are not convinced and still want this book, wait a little while. It should hit the remainder bins soon."
5,A BOOK WORTHY FOR YOUR EROTICA COLLECTION.,"The first thing you notice about this book is it's 7 1/2 by 5 1/2 by 2 1/4 inch thick. A small and thick book just like the books Cheescake! and Eric Stanton The Dominant Wives and Other Stories. This book is a collection of mostly black and white photos of nude women in erotic lingerie that our fathers (your father, not the country's founders)oogled. They are great picts and can still tittilate you with their beautiful bodies and faces. I think this will be a worthy addition to your collection of erotica. Pretty soon this will be a collector's item so grab 'em while you can."
3,Make your own mind up,"Pay no attention to the vitriol of the english reviewer below. McKenna won his court case against claims that he knowingly bought his doctorate from a disreputable university. He also won a previous case brought against him. And if you have Sky TV, he is on TV over the last year with shows about confidence, fat loss etc. His reputation in the UK is pretty good."
2,DVD and CD problems,"I received the book and found that the DVD audio and video were not in sync. The CD would not open on my computer as it couldn't see anything in the drive. The disc did play on an old audio device I have so I knew the file was there. Thinking the discs were defective, I sent the book back for another copy with total cooperation from Amazon. Unfortunately, the exchange copy discs presented the same problems. Amazon could not help me, though they gave it it a good try; we agreed that exchanging my copy for a new one again would likely lead to the same problem again and that the defects in the discs were out of their control. I called the publishing company and did not find them to be helpful. I found this frustrating and disappointing, as I am left with a defective product with no recourse. I had been looking forward to getting the book/DVD/CD for months, fully expecting my previous experiences with McKenna's products to be repeated. This time was unpleasantly different."
5,Worth a try,"I got this book for the UK seller, and though I don't subscribe to a seven day change, I do subscribe to the idea of breaking a non productive thought pattern and re-setting your mind to a different dimension.I listen at bed time, and as for all mind reprogramming things, you do have to give it a time. Start with 7 days, and see how it goes, but definitely give it a try"
4,Excellent information,"This book is filled with useful information about how our brains and minds work. There are numerous great quotes from well known people, and they tie in with the chapter topic. Paul McKenna does an excellent job of givong the reader many different and helpful techniques you can use right away. It has taken me more than seven days to read it, but I am pretty busy. Still, it is all very helpful."
4,A number of useful techniques,"Another reviewer said that it was possible to follow the directions in this book and have nothing change. I've read this book, and I find that claim to be bizarre.In order for that to happen, for you to do the exercises in this book properly and have nothing change, you need to be so bullheaded as to actually turn your back on everything you learned and just plod on in the same, stupid direction you always took. You could do that, of course; but why bother?Or you could just lie, and say, ""Yeah, teach. Dog ate my homework. I did real good, dunno why I forgot everything."" Or even, ""Oh, yeah, but I already knew how to do that, prof. Want my money back.""Buy the book, and do the exercises. To paraphrase Richard Bandler: ""If it didn't work, you didn't do what he said. You did the other one- the one where you ask, 'What the heck is this guy talking about?'""This book includes NLP tools for life change that would cost hundreds of dollars to learn elsewhere."
4,It's like taking a course!,"This 7 day program is quite an intensive course on discovering and figuring yourself out. I am finding it requiring more time and emotional energy than I planned yet I see that it will be invaluable in the log run! Wow, it makes you look hard at yourself. 5 years of therapy in a book. The CD is great. Listening to it even if you don't read the book is still great for you self esteem."
3,This book does not contain a CD,"I ordered this book because I mistakenly thought it was the hardcover version of Paul McKenna's ""Change Your Life in Seven Days"" paperback published by Bantam Press. The paperback and hardcover may contain the same text (both are 256 pages), but only the paperback version contains an audio CD. This harcover version does not contain a CD, but shows you where to download the audio online.Other than being miffed that I didn't get a CD with this hardcover, I am a big fan of Paul McKenna. His audio trances really work for me."
4,Practical Techniques for Change,"I expected much more from this book , however there were some very practical techniques that were useful for living successfully."
1,I was going to buy this book....,"But then I looked at all of the other reviews & they seemed fake. You know how you can tell? They're all suspiciously posted on ""February 13th"" & all posted by various customers with no other Amazon reviews. Bizarre.But I've decided not to purchase this book. Hope you make your decision wisely too.For Self-help books on changing your life - I recommend Michael Lossier's Law of Attraction."
1,Download link does not work,"Have anybody here failed to download the audio track?I just bought his book last week and followed his instructions to download but the page is always not found.Write to his support at www.paulmckenna.com but till date, no response.It will be the last time I bought any of his books"
2,Should be called Stand and Be Fit,"This DVD is called ""Sit and Be Fit"". So imagine my surprise when I got the product in the mail to use with the seniors in my Long Term Care facility (90% of whom use wheelchairs for ambulation), and read the DVD contents on the inside, which included standing leg strengthening, standing balance, standing leg stretching, etc.While the exercises are of a good quality, I can't use this disc with my residents. I'm going to have to give it to the activity department for the independant living community.The people who put out this DVD should relabel it to ""Stand and Be Fit""."
2,Looked better in the pitcure,"I received the item faster than I thought I would, and was excited about getting it, but was disappointed when I opened it because it looked better in the pitcure. I intend on returing it. Darn."
1,From novice?,"This book covers basic programming terminology, but then when they go into programs it is difficult to decipher what is code and what is code segments. I haven't worked with scripting languages. I expected to be able to use Perl but the time required to decipher this book is too much. Also I have been told by friends that are into Comp Sci that Python or JavaScript"
3,"Heavy Academic Text, Hard to Apply...","I don't know if this applies as a full review or just a few quick notes/thoughts.I bought this book recently because I am interested in optimizing my own therapeutic effectiveness, and thought the book would provide some good techniques or principles that would guide my time with clients.Unfortunately, the book is heavy in theory and written by persons who are obviously good at research and statistics, but not good at communicating their findings in a way that can be applied.I'm not saying not to buy the book, but expect to do a lot of work getting through this book, and even more translating it from Professional Journal speak into something with utility for your practice.Hope this helps!Final Note: If you're interested in learning telephone or online counseling, this book is really good:The Therapist's Clinical Guide to Online Counseling and Telephone Counseling: The Definitive Training Guide for Clinical Practice"
2,Dead Zune,"At first my dead zune lite up,and then died again be careful what you ask for. If it's not from the company that made the product don't buy it."
3,just the same as Pulse,this cd or 'bootleg' is just a reprint or import of Pulse from the same exact concert not rare AT ALL so dont waste 200 bucks on something you can spend just over 20 bucks forso really this cd was pointless to even sell
1,boring,"boring and messy screenplay with vague scenario, involving bunch of criminals against one another, an office woman and a geek. putting a bomb in an office on an office building's 17th floor to eliminate some evidences. long scenes and endless dialop in an elevator. lot of illogic garbage could not be explained well. need to use fast forward to go to the end. one of the most boring thrillers ever seen. stay away from this italian deadbeat as far as you could."
4,good product,"It's hard to tell if a preventative medicine is actually preventing symptoms, but it does seem to help on the days when I think a migraine is coming on. It is not in a child safe bottle and the tablets do become powder when carried around/shaken up too much. However, I find it useful enough to take with me everywhere"
3,Family Fun at the movies,"Friends of mine needed a game to play for a small party, someone brought Shout at the Movies . This trivia was fun for a DVD game. However, Many like me who are film buffs felt the game was slightly dumb down for a youth market.My suggestion is make a game with older movies. This edition seems for for more for families running mainly 1980-present filmsNow to the good points, it is a fast paced trivia game that keeps score for the players and lets you know where you stand after each round. It is a group game, so great fun family and friendsBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
4,"Great, but need more games on each disc!","We love this game! We have played both this game and Scene It, and we think this is superior. It is true that you only get 3 games per disc, which is our least favorite part of the game. The other review written by the creator of the game is a little misleading. The disc has three games, and has about 3.4-3.5 gigabytes of data, which means they probably could fit 4 games on a disc if they are using a standard single-layer DVD (4.7GB), or up to 8 games on a disc if they used a dual-layer DVD (9.4GB). Dual-layer is what most DVD movies you purchase are, and that would be normal for something mass-produced like this game.As I said though, we do love this, and we plan to swap discs with my brother who has a different version when we have both played them all."
1,Guaranteed to Disappoint!,I ordered The Distinguished Racing Heritage of Porsche as well as 'Ferrari' by Brentwood Home Video. Once I viewed these DVDs I realized how Brentwood chose their name.I would be ashamed to call these DVDs home videos. Their video quality is below that of most camcorders. The content is hokey and the music is reminiscent of porn movies of the 70's.You've been warned!
2,pffff,"Is mere a basic copy of bad VHS quality on a DVD. Weird music, lazy interviews, bad camera shooting, ...Only if you are a fan of Ferrari...but you should better buy the VHS video ""The World of Ferrari""...much more better.Didier."
2,How the US won the war and the allies helped a little!,"Correct me if I'm wrong but the US did enter the war 2-3 years after the other allies, yes? Well, you'd never know it from watching this muddled and patched together account of WW1. From the outset you are into an almost total US perspective of WW1, and considering the other allies had been engaged in fighting for such a long time before the US arrived, this is a bit much to take. It also means that a lot of interesting and crucial non-US perspective is missed out.The narrator is, well, how can I say this kindly? Well you get the feeling he is narrating this while facing and talking to his living room wall. It could and should have been done with a lot more passion. Everything was 'ineresin' (yuk!) or 'kind o' (oh no!) etc etc. a casual style of presentation that really detracted from the seriousness of the event. By tape 7 I was definitely feeling maybe this would be better with sound off."
2,A pedestrian effort,"This series has the look and feel of something that was slapped together for the educational market. The film's only real virtue is a large amount of original period footage, but the accompanying narration is banal and often inaccurate.This is ,at best ,an archive and not a compelling history. Definitely a far cry from the Robert Ryan/CBS News 1964 documentary, which is regrettably out of print."
2,Get rid of yellow nails product found on Amazon.,it was just okay. only lighten the yellow a little. I am hoping it will work as a base coat and keep the yellow from coming back.the nail that was not yellow really got white.
1,So-So,"Develop 10 Yellow Buster Instant Nail Brightener Gets Yellow OutDoesn't live up to ""instant"" claim. Used several times and see very slight improvement. Possibly would work better on someone else. I don't want to ""knock"" this product if it can help another customer."
3,grass roots mma,"This is the smallest event offered on video at Amazon, and indicative of the lower level fighting promotions in the US. The production values are a little below standard, as it looks like there were only two cameras used to film the event. When the switch is made between viewpoints, sometimes you'll miss a second or two of action, but the fights are still totally watchable. This is actually the 2nd event that Gladiator Challenge held, and is headlined by Jerry Bohlander fighting Romie Aram. Bohlander, who 5 years ago was arguably the best fighter actively competing under 200 lbs, is returning from a 2 year layoff. See how he does."
1,the rip off book,This book was 25.00 aproximately and looked like a 5 dollar book. It had few pages and was not enough information for a high school student to write a report on for her career choice. The postage was about the value of this book.
1,NASTY SPRING,"A friend of mine gave me this book to read, and I was shocked by the poems. The words that can best describe them are DISTURBING AND PORNOGRAPHIC. I was embarrassed to read them, and, believe me, I don't embarrass easily. The poem ""The First"" is so sexually graphic that it belongs in an adult only book store, and should be so labeled.I like poetry that is uplifting, about traditional themes such as love (not just sex), the beauty of the natural world, etc.I gave this book back to my friend, and I cannot recommend it to anyone.Sincerely,Alex Charles"
1,Poetry of Sharon Olds,"THE WELLSPRING by Sharon Olds is representative of much of herpoetry, which I characterize in the same way as the respectedpoetry critic Helen Vendler: self-indulgent, sensationalist,and even pornographic. It is bad enough that this book if fullof sexually explicit acts, such as in the poems ""Full Summer""""Early Images of Heaven"" and ""First"" as well as many others.In addition, the poet expresses her disrespect for life in thepoem ""Killing My Sister's Fish"" in which she recounts the episodein which she poisons her sister's fish with ammonia, and does soin her own words ""as if without regret."" I feel reverence forall life, no matter how great or small the creature, and wasgreatly disturbed by this poet's attitute.In short, I am thoroughly REPULSED by the poetry of Ms. Olds,and will communicate as much to all of my family, friends, andacquaintances.Respectfully,Catherine Ross"
1,THE WELLSPRING,I don't understand why this woman poet talks about her sex lifein a book of poems. Shouldn't she talk about that to a priest or to a psychologist?
1,Weak and full of complaints,Though her language is poetic her poetry is full of complaints. Sometimes about her father. Sometimes about her mother. Her style is repetitive weak and filled with self -pity
1,TERRIBLE POETRY,"The only thing I can think to say about this book of poems is that they are TERRIBLE. I've never heard so may nasty words -I mean really nasty, sex words, that do not belong in decent books. I feel ashamed to have read them, and cannot recommend this book to anyone."
3,A deeper background into the life of St. Gemma Galgani,"This book gives a in depth study into the life and canonisation of St Gemma Galgani. On the plus side, the authors have translated some of her writings into English for the first time. They have included portions of her autobiography, her diary and some of her ecstacies and letters.On the negative side, the approach of the book itself is quite academic, and therefore may not interest more casual or first time readers into the life of St. Gemma. For this reason, I would highly recommend ""The Life of St. Gemma Galgani"" written by her spiritual director, Venerable Father Germanus C.P. which is the ""bible"" for Saint Gemma devotees.The Life of St. Gemma GalganiGlenn Dallaire"
5,Kudos to you!,"We have all heard how sequels to either books or movies never seem to come close to the original; however, when it comes to Brotherhood: Gay life in College Fraternities, I would have to say Shane Windmeyer has out done himself. With heroic stories of accomplishments and tales of stories you may never have heard someone speak of, this book offers author's, reader's, and anyone else who just glances through its stunning pages, the ability to jump right into the story and live it with that person. A big KUDOS is in order for the amount of work and preperation all of these authors had to go through in getting this done. Thank you Shane for producing such a vibrant and visual book for the public to read and understand the mystery behind Fraternities and to dispell the myths."
3,Read The Headlines,It was very easy to get the productive kernels by just skimming through it and reading the boldened words.Nothing new or inspiring but it is good to return to fundamental truths from time to time.
3,Ravishing redundance,"3 1/2No-frills beauty bombast on what is probably the groups best work to date, if wearing its compositional limitation comfortably."
3,To many repeats,"I loved the Disk 1,, it was great, I love the concept, the on screen scoring, the old and new mix of movies (All of us knew something, our 10 yr old, 14, 16, 19 yr old and us) I HAD to get game two, got it cheap, was so excited... we just played it, and at least half, seemed like more, were the same movies represented on the first disk.The questions were different, the scenes were different, but once you go through the same answers, it was more just trying to remember what last disk's answers were... I was sooo dissappointed....Seems as though the company only got the rights to a few select movies,,, and had to rearrange questions to come up with same answers...Too bad.. I was hooked."
4,Really fun game.,"Easy to play, instructions are all on the DVD and you're playing with friends in minutes. I love bringing this out at parties. I end up with adults screaming at the TV like mad animals no matter how doubtful they were about a game to start with.Highly recommend.Only bummer, only 3 games on the DVD. Once you've played them, you'd be cheating as the host to play again! I give my disc away to friends after I've gone through them all."
4,An historical look into a farming community,"Kittlesen depicts Frost, Minnesota as a sleepy but friendly community where little things were big news. Having been to Frost a few months ago, I realize that the town has slowed since the 1950s into little more than a bedroom community where residents primarily work in (larger) neighboring towns. Kittlesen presents an interesting account of what it was like growing up in a small rural village, where everybody knew everybody and life was much simpler, and it is presented in a familiar, slow paced fashion conducive to leisure reading."
1,Amazon screwed up,"Amazon groups all the Haynes #42025 manuals together no matter which edition they are nor which vehicles they cover. The accompanying images are confusing and the descriptions are false. The seller delivered the product he was advertising. It was not his fault that Amazon grouped his older manual along with the newer ones.The other side of this issue is the publisher's attitude when queried about why subsequent editions of the same-numbered manual don't include a suffix of some sort denoting a later edition. Haynes' reply to me was, ""The covered vehicles are indicated on the cover. Thank you for your interest in Haynes Manuals.""I donated the manual I received to our local library book sale as it cost more to return it than I would receive in credit."
5,E15T4 15-inch LCD Monitor,"I purchased one of these monitors a few months back. It's a great item. Very sleek and stylish. Easy to hook up and operate. No drivers to load or anything!!! I'm so pleased, I'm buying another today!EDIT: I now have two of these great monitors and I got them both for under $125.00 each! :)"
3,Always Useful,"I just pulled this off the shelf while working on a new part of my campaign. Although written for 3.0, it was easy to mod over for 3.5. Although the traps seem to get redundant after a while, there are enough gems in here to make it worthwhile to have around."
2,Some Useful Ideas But The Scope is too Limited,"This book gave me a few ideas. But, I was really dissapointed by the total absence of any outdoor traps."
2,Older Harlequin; not too good,"At least this Harlequin romance heroine had a real career -- as a nurse in war-torn countries. She gets seriously wounded during a siege in Beirut and finally has to come back to Britain to recover and to face her inner demons (she was responsible for killing a child in a drunken car accident 10 years previously).Heavy stuff for a typical Harlequin, which I appreciate, but as usual, spoiled, by turning the (28-year-old virgin) heroine into a spineless wimp every time she gets near the hero. And the hero is unfortunately a typical alpha male, the controlling-brutish-sort. ISHBEL'S PARTY, aside from giving the heroine a real profession, has nothing very original about its characters or their relationship. It's readable, but that's about it."
1,Don't Base this album off of their other work,"I have to agree with the others here, I bought this album because their previous album was amazing, and I was completely disappointed, completely."
1,"LOL Fresh you idiot, if you wanted to get rid of a cash cow, this is it!","Terrible. No wonder their new stuff is being released on Warner. Mind you, dont check out the song propane. Its horrible.this double cd is nothing of pendulum apart from its name. total waste of time.the demise of BBK is well and truley on its way."
4,Very good book but newer edition by same authors is better.,This was an excellent book with detailed coverage of threads programming even down to how various hardware architectures affect multithreaded program behavior. However there is a more current edition under a different name (Multithreaded Programming with Pthreads) by the same authors that is more current that I would recommend instead (everything in this book is in the newer book).
2,Some nuggets but some VERY dated information,"This book was written in the mid 90s (an era of 300Mhz, single-core CPUs) which is an eternity in computer terms. While a lot of the theoretical discussion in the book is quite meaningful and relevant, the code examples--referring mostly to an ancient version of Solaris -- are badly out of date. No mention is made of linux, windows 7, or OSX, for example. The book predates both multi-core computers and hyperthreading. My hope in purchasing this book was to get up to speed quickly on modern multithreaded coding techniques using modern languages available to me and I haven't been able to achieve that at all. This book might be important historically and does provide some interesting detail about theoretical aspects of multithreaded programming (at least circa 1996), but I would encourage anyone who's new to threads to find a more recent book."
3,Chill,"Not completely my style, the first CD is competely chill out kinda. Like Danny howells global underground cd1. But this is a little quicker and more beat tempo. I liked the first cd...highlight is track 6. CD is just completely gone bad, i didnt like it at all. I dont think i would recommend this compilation to anybody...."
3,From The Inside Flap:,"Dasher - that was his Secret Service code name when he ran for President - and the facts of his life are well known: schoolboy, naval officer, peanut farmer, defeated candidate, Governor, President. He's spoken millions of words to us citizens of the United States, and lots of us still wonder who he is. James Wooten has known him for a long time - as Atlanta bureau chief, as campaign correspondent, and now as White House Correspondent for The New York Times. He's talked to Dasher, to his mother, Miss Lillian, his sister Gloria, his brother Billy, and to a lot of other people around the country and in the White House, so by now he's not fooled by words - or by politics either. DASHER: THE ROOTS AND THE RISING OF JIMMY CARTER gets down to the man behind the face - at last."
4,Great but not perfect,"POISON 20 YEARS OF GREATEST HITS. songs include hits from Look what the cat dragged in, Open up and say ahh, Flesh and blood, Native tongue, Power to the people and poison's last studio album Hollyweird (Shooting star). It also includes 1 cover 'Rock n roll all nite' and 1 new song'Were an american band'.Only complaint which is why i'ts not perfect is the fact that there are no songs from Crack a smile or Swallow this. I Would include 'Be the one' or Mr Smiley from Crack a smile and 'So tell me why' from Swallow this and maybe drop 'I want action' and 'Look what the cat dragged in'. Also i thought it was a bit soon for another greatest hits cd considering the last cd was 'Ballads and blues' which is also a greatest hits album.A boxset of unrealesed songs would have also been great for the 20 year aniversary."
3,Actually missed alot of great songs...but it's a good place to start,"Cool collection, but they really did miss out on alot of the earlier material...they could have put the entire Look What the Cat Dragged in Cd on here as far as I'm concerned....that really was the band at their punky rock best...then things got a bit too polished for me, but a very cool band regardless....fans should also check out Fozzy All That Remains Reloaded, really great edgy melodic hard rock with the WWE wrestler Chris Jericho singing...and he has a GREAT hard rock voice!"
5,cool birthday present,"i got this awesome cd for my bithday ,i like all of the songs on it. nothin'but a good time is my favorite. i also like talk dirty to me.i want action,unskinny bop,ride the wind,and cry tough .bret,cc,bobby,and rikki have a great year!rock on dudes! ed wilson"
5,"great CD, great album if you like Poison!","great CD, great album if you like Poison! Fast ship from Amazon and great price. Amazon never disappoints."
5,Awesome CD,"Bought this cd for my teenager, she loves the classic rock and Poison is one of her favorites."
4,what fun!,"This group is so much fun to listen to and watch! I've been a fan for years, and it's nice to see the guys still sounding so great. This cd had a good selection of their biggest hits."
4,Poison Still rocks,This album has all the rocking hits Poison is famous for. It's good and you will enjoy it.
3,I didnt know what to expect,"I am honestly a 80's headbanger and didnt really know who Poison was because I'm 14. I was expecting that they were more of a metal band and thought they would be good judging upon their glam metal looks. But I guessed wrong but honestly they werent all bad, some songs that I did enjoy were 'Look what the cat dragged in', 'Nothin but a good time', and 'Unskinny Bop'. But thats really all. I'm just more of a Ratt, Warrent, or Judas Priest fanatic then I am a Poison. Sorry."
1,Track Listing Not Accurate,"Even though most people would not care nor even know the difference, but the song ""I Won't Forget You"" on this cd is NOT the single (rock radio) version--instead, it's the original? I had the single on vinyl and if you will take a listen at the video, you'll know what I mean. Does anyone know if there may be a mistake with the first batch? Hopefully, the record company will put the correct version on the cd, as that version and the single version of ""I Want Action"" is the only reason why I bought this collection."
1,THE WORST OF POISON!!!!!!!!!,I HATE POISON THE SONG I HATE THE MOST IS EVREY ROSE HAS A THORN IS THE MOST HORRIBLE SONG OF ALL TIME THE FIRST TIME I HEARD IT I THOUGHT OF THROWING UP THERE ONLY GOOD SONG IS NOTHIN BUT A GOOD TIME. ALL POISON IS IS A ONE HIT WONDER!!!!!MY ADVICE IS DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!
3,Poison,"The best way I can equate Poison in the grand scheme of rock n' roll is such. Motley Crue would be Budwiser, while Poison would be Coors light. You only drink it when you have to. But after a few drinks it tastes just as good as a good Bud.This best of really covers what needs to be covered. 'Talk Dirty To Me' 'Cry Tough' and the fantastic almost street cred worthy 'Look What The Cat Dragged In' represent the glam movement better than anything else in rock history. 'Nothin' But A Good Time' is timeless, and 'Every Rose Has It's Thorn' is cheesy yet at times enjoyable. 'Unskinny Bop' (or a baseball players slump buster) and 'Ride The Wind' are classics in my book. 'Something To Believe In' is overproduced but I love it.The groups covers of 'We're An American Band' 'Rock N' Roll All Night' and 'Your Mama Don't Dance' are all way better than the originals."
3,Great music but scratches,"I am not downing Poison and their greatest at all here, but the condition of the CD was not too good as their were noticeable deep scratches on it. I did however get a clean rip onto my computer after several tries of cleaning with an eye glasses cloth.. With that I did not return the CD and will give it 3 stars."
3,Pretty Good Album,first off let me say that poison is a pretty good band average hairmetal band from the 80s. the reason i gave this album three stars though is because its just another greatest hits with the same songs. key tracks here are nothing but a good time and look what the cat dragged in... all in all okay album
3,"Anthony is correct, not enough 'Cat Dragged In...' Material","Let's set the make up image aside....Look What The Cat Dragged In is an all time classic PUNK/ROCK CD. The music is full of energy and reckless...then the band found blues and quickly went down hill......This CD is too top heavy in the bands sappy and bluesy material...could have been so much better. For a great rock/metal Cd with attitude, check out that Fozzy cd somebody recommended. Incredible!All That Remains Reloaded (W/Dvd)"
4,4.5 Stars... This Album ROCKS HARD!!!!,"I consider myself not being a Poison fan. However I must recognize that when I heard ""Unskinny Bop"" and ""Every Rose Has Its Thorn"", I found out that Poison is a VERY GOOD Rock band.The sound quality of this CD is outstanding. Also, pay special attention to the cover versions of Kenny Loggins' ""Your Mama Don't Dance"" and Grand Funk Railroad's ""We're An American Band"". Great!!!!"
4,Rockin' n Rollin' all Night!,"If you're talkin' bout Rock n Roll, then definitely you're talkin' bout POISON; the best hair metal band and the sons of glam rock! This 20th anniversary collection shows the undeniable truth that POISON marks as an icon to the 80's rock n roll. But I find it dissapointing that the songs included were almost the same in their first Greatest Hits collection. In my opinion, they should'nt have included songs like Were an American Band, Rock n' Roll All Nite and Your Mama Dont Dance since they were released in a revival album called Poison'd. The new songs included like Shooting Star and Last Song were impressive however. All the rest were truly great POISON classics. Overall, this CD may be the best substitute to their Greatest Hits 86-96 collection."
4,Great album,A great album...from a great time...the eighties...I forgot how entertaining the big hair bands were from that era...like being back in high school.
3,What do you expect? It's Poison.,"I got this for the handful of favorites I remember from my youth...I've dated myself...The thing is: They had a lot of really bad songs which are on this album as well. Granted, this is only my opinion."
5,Poison at it's finest,Poison is one of my all time favourite bands. Love listening to C.C. Deville on guitar. As long as the original line-up is together you really can't beat their sound. Great band. Of course waiting for this CD I already bought every other CD they released so it was a great buy.
5,Poison ROCKSSS,"This CD is truly a collection of the very best of Brett Michael's and boys. If you loved them back in the hair band days YOU NEED THIS CD!!! It's also the best price I've found on the web. Well from any place with a name for themselve that is, sure you could buy it on ebay for less but with Amazon you know you have an actual business to contact if there's a problem. I purchased it, they emailed me tracking info, it arrived when they said it would. It rocks just like it did back in the day!!! Long live the Hair bands!!"
5,Valuable Contribution to Bass Repertoire,"The bass is not known for its vast repertoire, but one of the most effective showcases is featured on this CD, the Giannini Psalm 130, for bass and orchestra. Richard Fredrickson plays with assurance and bravura, with a rich, splendidly full and soulful sound. The sound quality is excellent and the SLO sounds magnificent (as they continue to do so for the last 5 years). John Carbon's new concerto for double bass, ""Endangered Species"" reveals a composer with an original voice, surprisingly lyrical and coherent, with a narrative quality that is fresh and much welcomed in today's new music wasteland. William Thomas McKinley continues to create excellently crafted orchestral music and is becoming one of the most recorded living composers. Bravo!"
1,disappointed,"I am extremely dissatisfied with your service because i got the wrong dvd, i chose Mariah Carey's dvd and i got Kenny G's dvd, can you guys resolve this problem?"
4,Just the right blend,"I am, concededly, neither a musician nor any sort of expert in the field. I do fancy myself to have an appreciation of soundtracks. As is common with many films, this CD combines rock music with music composed specifically for the movie. It works. Indeed, the choice of, ""The Seeker,"" as the title track for both the film and soundtrack is inspired, Terence Stamp's links with The Who notwithstanding.I do wish that the full track-- or at least a clearer track-- of Terence Stamp's, ""Colours,"" had been provided. This sound link to the film _Poor Cow_, in itself a precursor to _The Limey_, is integral to the relationship between Wilson (Stamp) and his daughter, Jenny.A good CD purchase for fans of the film!"
5,Great Read!,"A wonderful ending to a positively wonderful series! I loved it, and read it a couple times every year! The only problem with the book is the way it ends... as if there are even more books.. Great charecters, good dialogue, good plot development. Must read!"
4,Best current French textbook I've seen so far,"I don't have much experience with French textbooks, but of the 3 I've looked at so far this is the best. There's almost no English in it so you learn French just by reading the explanations. My main gripe is that it is written for college students and doesn't focus enough on a person's language needs in the real world. I rated it so highly because I found it easy to learn from, both in a class and studying on my own. It is well organized and seems to cover just the right amount of detail about grammar. Apparently it's out of print which is a pity because the other beginner's textbook I've used (Mais Oui) is absolutely awful."
5,Grandma of 7,Ray Vander Laan is a teacher I would like to have had my children and grandchildren have in school. What insights! Oh how I wish I could go on a tour with him leading. Absolutely having the entire 12 dvd's is a must for my library.
3,Not As Interesting As It Should Be,"This encyclopedia does cover a wide array of topics regarding Los Angeles and it's history, but the writing is not that interesting. And the articles are just too brief to provide more than a very basic understanding (which, I suppose, is what an encyclopedia is all about). As a newcomer to LA, it has answered some questions about things like the origination of certain street names and the history of specific areas of town, but I really would like something with more meat to it."
5,Top notch,"Very helpful and complimenting to other anatomy guides for artists , I got many new tips and pointers out of this book which also cover subjects some other books skip ."
4,Cross-hatching,This book uses cross-hatching as a way to shade and model body parts. It's delightful but distracting.
5,And the beat goes on,"""Dream Catcher Games"" is the extraordinary new novel from acclaimed and world renown journalist John Nunes. The story is intricate yet entertaining and, once begun, becomes a compulsory page turner. Nunes continues to amaze me with his success in writing sports fiction while others just completely fall short. Jump on the bandwagon now before a lifetime of novels by this man has passed you by."
1,Poor quality. Don't waste the money.,"I bought this item to store toys. The material never unwrinkled so it doesn't look like it does in the picture. It looks like it was stuffed in a closet for a few months. It was $10, but worth about $2. Really poor quality. Don't waste your money."
3,good soldiers bad politicians,we got lawyers who need to give approval to kill the enemywhen are we going to wake up and clean up washington for good?
4,A Good One...,"I have enjoyed Mr. Roderick's views on witchcraft and theneo-pagan movement. He brings more of a theoretical and archetypalview to his writing, which gives the range of literature on the Crafta bit more leverage. Mr. Roderick is a psychologist and this is nothis first book to use mythological archetypes to outline the neo-paganand Wiccan spiritual journey... This book gives a wonderfullydetailed and beautifully written account of the journey - read it.Experience the journey in your own way and in your own language, butread this book to find the vocabulary with which to express yourjourney. It is insightful and helpful - thank you, Timothy Roderick!"
2,Disappointed.,"Though well written, the core of this book is about Buddhist priniciples with some Castaneda-esque moments thrown in ."
2,Does not really work.,"It does NOT reduce the bad odor from the water, and the water is still full of rust. I can clearly smell and feel that. So disappoited."
5,Great Value,"I originally purchased my shower head elsewhere and have bought the replacements filters from the same company. I'm so glad I checked here this time. I saved 50% on the filters, using my prime I had no shipping costs, and I received it in 2 days vs 7 from the other place. Works great!"
3,Not thrilled,"I've used filters for at least 10 yrs. when I put these in my shower, I didn't notice any difference. Not completely sure why, but can't give them a better review until I figure out why my skin feels so dry after showering."
5,"Awesome, these work!","I am one person....in a one bath condo...after 2.5 to 3 months of using this, if I don't change it out, I can TOTALLY feel my scalp start to get super itchy it hurts...so does my skin...definitely worth it cuz clearly this removes most of the nasty chlorine out of the water!"
4,Any Difference from NewMarket Naturals?,"Anyone know if this filter replacement cartridge is the same as the New Market Naturals replacement cartridge? They look the same...cost about the same.Thanks for any replies.UPDATE: I have made a phone call to New Market Naturals and they told me the Sprite filters are exactly the same as their own.I have very hard water which has taken quite a toll on my hair and skin. I ordered the ""April Shower APHH Handheld Shower Head and Filter Includes Pulse Massage"" in Feb. 2010, I have noticed a notable improvement in the my hair and slight improvement in my skin.This is a very nice and affordable option to helping improve the water quality in a rental unit where water hardness/softness is not a tenant responsibility.Since, at this time I noticed the New Naturals brand replacement filters cost less, I will order them vs the Sprite."
5,Filter works well and lasts,"This filter seems to do a good job... at least it lowers the chlorine smell of my water. You can also reverse it after a few months to get more life out of it. I would say they seem to last about 6-8 months before they are ""full"" and need to be replaced because they are reducing water flow."
3,Condition,It was in ok condition. There were black spots all around the edges of the book and there was some ink scribbles inside the front cover. Thought it would be in better condition since it said very good condition in the discription.
4,"Yukon Ho Ho Ho, as Santa would say.","Very amusing but not as good as the others, Calvin is a very interesting child with a lot to look up to when he is older. He has instinks but he never follows them. Hobbs however, I never understood, he's a stuffed animal who has the brains in the outfit. They both go through many adventures together, and one or the other always spoil it. It is a fun and entertaning comic about a boy and his imaginary tiger, Hobbes, who happens to be a stuffed toy."
3,The creator is a God.,"Unfortunately, I say it rather cynically.My, there are so many monsters peopling this strip. The kid's a monster. His parents are monsters. The tiger's a monster. The teacher's a monster. The babysitter's a monster. And the only character who's not a monster (and more of a victim) is naturally enough, a young girl who is never bad or gets into any trouble. And the strip, while a rugrat's fantasyland, also smacks of extreme adolescent rebellion.The strip is so overrated even after its demise a decade ago that it's been ensured that no cartoonist alive or yet to be born would ever create a strip as well-worshipped as it is for all eternity to come. So why not just remove the whole comic section from the news for good?"
5,Excellent Treasury,"If you're a Calvin and Hobbes fan, you need this collection. If you're not a Calvin and Hobbes fan, you should read this collection so you can become a fan.Contains the strips from ""Yukon Ho!"" and ""Weirdos From Another Planet!"""
4,The Best Collection!!!!!,"This is one cool book. It was my first C&H book ever. This has the two best ""small"" C&H books. Another cool thing about this book is that it colorizes all the comics that ran in the Sunday paper. The reason I didn't give it a higher rating was that it is not to the high standard of his new ones. I think that Weirdos From Another Planet is awesome but not as good as Yukon Ho!. If you have all the new ones (The Days are Just Packed and on) then buy this one for nostalgic purposes"
5,One Heck Of A Ride,"Reading ""Horses Don't Have Handlebars"" is like riding a Harley through the American soul -- fast, gritty and full of life. This is a very good read."
3,Poor Remastering,"The other reviews are accurate in terms of the importance of the music. The music is simple and enjoyable and the Carter Family's earliest recordings set the stage for what came later in both country and folk music. What holds this back from being a five star review is the poor remastering of the music. The process used created a high pitched whine near the end of most tracks, which is very annoying. There are better remastered versions out there, starting with the great Bear Family box. Seek out this music, but go for a different remastering."
1,Strata StudioPro 2.0 Workbook 1 is garbage,"Having just received Strata StudioPro 2.0 Workbook 1 by Heather Kennedy, I am extremely disappointed by the overall quality and content of the book. Not only is it cheaply produced - it looks like its been photocopied - it is full of typos and features substandard grammar. Overall, the book is unprofessional and not worth the price paid. I would not recommend this book or her other book ""Strata StudioPro 2.0 Workbook 2"".Buyer beware."
3,Padded review,"Most of the reviews for this book (8 of the 13 at the time I read them) were written by ""A Reader"" from undisclosed location, spanning review dates from late 1998 to mid 1999. High star rating from the many postings of ""A Reader."" Suspect the reviews have been padded."
5,"""Home truly is where the heart is.""",Leslie reaches deep into the heart and provides us with a most valuable resource to acclimate ourselves and our families to a new environment. Her tried and true tips for success in any community obviously speak from experience. Leslie's cup is overflowing with wisdom that she shares so readily with us in this book. I was also privileged to see her on the ERA tour!
5,excellent,This book arrived on time and in the condition in which it was described. This book is a required text in one of my graduate courses and it arrived in plenty of time for me to read ahead. Thanks so much!
3,"Works well, but BEWARE not for AC power!","We are using this in a multi-screen church application.The amplifier did a great job AFTER our electronics tech completely retrofitted it with an adapter (via solder) to allow it to run on AC power. The online descrption does NOT indicate that it is made for use in 12v DC auto applications and will not work on AC power without new splices, an AC convertor, and soldering."
5,works as advertise,Hooked it up to feed and boost video signal from my car head unit towards the headrest monitors. Video noise is now resolved. The item is not what is being pictured on Amazon that looks to have a plastic casing. While the one I received is made up of metal and looks very sturdy. I am glad it is the one I received rather than those plasticy thingy. Solid product and deliver the functionality of its intended use. Highly recommended.
4,"Not what expected, but served my purpose.","First off, I didn't really know what to expect going in. I had read another review saying this ran off of DC power, but I was not really sure what this meant. When I received the package, it had two wires for power cables. Woah. Luckily, I tinker with this sort of thing, and recalled taking apart an old Airsoft Gun battery charger. Even more lucky, it was a 12v DC to AC adapter that charged my gun! How lucky! With a few snips, I scrapped the old charger, and with a little electrical tape, rigged up a make-shift power source. After that, this product works splendidly. The quality of the output is great, although it takes a little tinkering with these ""quality knobs"" above each output. Set-up time with the whole power source ordeal was about 15 minutes. Well worth the time, as I can now record video from my XBOX 360 without having to play off a laptop screen! Recommended for those with minor electrical knowledge."
3,Good but there are better,"I think Manhattan Trinity is one of best working trios now.While I sometimes question if Cyrus's phrasing is as good as say Mulgrew or Reed (among young guns) I still like what I have heard.But adding ""Alexander The Great"" just does not work as well a one might hope given how great there are in different groups.Mraz and Nash have such a thing going on laying back for Alexander detracts from what they could do.If looking for a great Manhattan Trinity try trio only like ""Gentle Rain"",""Alfie"",or""Misty"" (they are damn expensive and haven't gotten all that's out here.If looking for an Eric Alexander CD there are main great one s from him or his ensemble ""All For One"".Try ""Alexander the Great"" with the ""Mighty Burner Charles Earland on B-3,""Solid"", or his lovely Ballad CD/LP's on Venus.But if completest get towards last of catalogue.Given the great choice of standards I was really a bit disappointed when I played this."
1,don't buy it,"Don't waste your money, these may be good movies but the picture quality looks like they recorded it with a vhs camcorder from the movie screen. The movies are cropped incorrectly cutting off titles and action. On top of that there's a annoying logo on screen the entire time ""Platinum Disc Corporation"""
4,3 Classic Movies -,"3 classic movies in one - video is ok - menu shows ""trailers"" but won't actually do anything. Watermark for video company is very annoying, but does go away after 10 minutes or so."
1,Very poor,This DVD was lame. Not even the kind of thing we watch when you can't sleep at night. Will get 55 cents at the yard sale.
5,Mai-Kai Memories,Having been born and raised in Ft. Lauderdale I frequented the Mai-Kai often throughout the years. This reminds me of the music they play in the background. Wonderful memories.
3,Looks likes metal but the smoke color is more grey then anything,Looks likes metal but the smoke color is more grey then anything. I bought the smoke coloring thinking it would be more like gunsmoke but its more of a grey smoke color. Otherwise the paint looks nice
5,Adorable!!!,"I bought this for my dad for Easter and he loves it. Cute bird and sounds just like the California Quail. It is hard to get a gift for an 87 year old, but this did the trick! Put a smile on his face."
5,Another great Wild Republic Bird,"My 6 year old Son saw these at the local public museum and has started to collect these great birds. They are hard to find in town, thank goodness for Amazon. Good educational value as he is really learning a lot about different birds and their habitats. Birds are durable and their sounds are very realistic (the dog always gets excited when she hears them).Overall a great value."
1,The New Millionaires-How To Succeed In Network Marketing,"Even though this book has some valid points, too much space was taken up by the writer telling us how he was going to reveal to us the smartest and easiest methods of making more money. Not until page 63(out of 93 pages) does he start talking directly about his new methods and they boil down to techniques to increase the sales of this book by suggesting that anybody in Network Marketing should hand out this little book to prospects. His style of writing uses lots of words that are capitalised, in italics, bold faced or with quotation marks. This makes the text difficult to read. On the whole I was disappointed by the book and I would not recommend it."
4,Great investment,if you have teens this is the best gift for them. I love the products my face looks great- . I just bought the same products in bigger sizes
1,No good,"Just as most travel bottle warmers, this one does not work. Well, the unit does get warm but after 10 minutes, the bottle is still cold. All travel warmers seem to be useless (from what I've read), so good old fashioned boiling water kept in a thermos and then poured into a cup works well for heating up a cold bottle (about 5 mins)."
5,Perfect,"August 9,2012 This music by Eric Bikales was one of the most fantastic music items me & my 2 male children have ever listened to. It was a great learning tool for music education in our house. The music compilations from Tranquility are quite impressive for today's music standards. A small idea of a modern idea in accordance to Mozart or Debussy in the 2012 era. Me & my 2 male children are talented musicaly and so we have a complete appreciation for the music arts. From,carisa,justus,connick and we are the Vangor family."
4,"Very, very good... but very, very sad","As an adoptive parent, I see a lot in this book that relates to the issues I am dealing with with my adoptive son, and with my four nieces and nephew for whom I am legal guardian. It is just so sad how poorly they connect to my husband and I. This is a very real, and very sad, book about the realities of adoption (and guardianship). The author clearly knows her stuff. This book was recommended to me by an adoptive parents' group I attend. I highly recommend it to anyone who is thinking of adopting or has already adopted... lots of food for thought."
2,Poor development of a fantastic idea for a novel,"I was most intrigued by the book description, and eager to read this one, however I was soon disappointed in that I did feel the story even came close to reaching its full potential. The idea itself was fantastic, and the writing was sharp and witty. The first 48 pages had me believing that the story was going to take off and be a truly memorable experience.But for me, the book lost its momentum in Chapter 4 and by that last chapter, I felt as if I had taken a flight from Boston to New York --without the plane ever leaving the ground."
4,Strange how electronic music develops.....,"Strange how electronic music develops: a boink and a clonk takes the place of kick and snare no matter how electronic they can be. Cold sound design. Cold sounds arranged in such a way that they create music - i think music has a lot to do with time: every track has its own Bpm for example. This album is the demonstration of how you can create something musical by clicks, bips and other cold sounds. The great majority of the tracks here are so minimal that are constructed by two sounds juxtaposed.Please if you have any feedback to this write to - carlogiova@yahoo.it - i would be happy to share thoughts. This is also valid for Matthew Mercer who is reviewer here."
3,More suitable for older kids,"This book has great illustrations, but it is definitely for older kids. The puns in this book are well over the heads of 5-year olds. It's very witty for those who understand the puns."
3,French/English Dictionary,"The dictionary is pretty useful - handy to take to class. I haven't found all of the words that I look up, but it's definitely a better dictionary than just a little pocket one."
1,"If You're an X-Men Fan, Skip This Book","The X-Men do make an appearance in the last part of the book, but it's only after the story's 80% told. It's as if Marvel threw them in only to boost sales. If you're buying the book to read about the X-Men, you can forget about it. The team is an afterthought to Alan Davis' tale of the Clan Destine. There's no real point to having the team in it at all...If you like Clan Destine or Alan Davis' artwork, then by all means, buy the book! However, if you want an X-Men story, buy X-tinction Agenda, X-cutioner's Song, or some other book that actually includes the X-Men in more than a cameo-like role."
1,The worst CD ever!!!!!,"There are horrible vocals, bad music, and no production quality at all. The CD is absolutely horrible. It just sucks. This album should not be sold in any way, shape or form. He should return the little to no money he made off this album. It was worse than the stupid van he drove around in."
4,Perfect for TV when you don't want to bug others,"I've had the Bean for about a month now, and it's perfect for my need, which is watching TV without bugging my significant other. I had used large over-the-ear wireless headphones, but found them heavy and hot.I find earbuds irritating after a while, so I plugged in a little pair of Sony outside-the-ear phones that I probably got with an MP3 player.I've seen a couple of reviews that talk about the cheap form factor, but I was looking for light, and it seems perfectly sturdy to me.It's not tremendously loud with the phones I'm using, but perfectly adaquate. For music I'd probably use my powered Bose's. The only real complaint I have is that you can't use them while charging, so if you don't plan ahead, it can be irritating. I'm getting better than 6 hours out of a charge or more tho."
4,A Very Complete Handbook,"Although written some years back, the wealth of information found in this book is still very useful. Not specific to any aspect of gliding, such as Reichmann's wonderful Cross Country Soaring, it covers topics from introduction to advanced theory, with advice on thermalling, outlanding, navigation, cross-country, mountain flying, waves, meteorology, racing, instruments... Very practical information on all aspects of this wonderful sport will bring experts' experience and advice to pilots of all levels. Advanced theory is simplified and it's practical implications explained. An interesting complement to a serious pilot's library."
2,Just a Dull CD,"I've liked everything from Psychopathic. And I like everyone on this CD, but it just falls flat.You see my other reviews, and you know I've dug everything from the Ringmaster through The Calm. But this...it's fun hearing the guys I like, but the songs and the music are just incredibly disappointing. I agree with others, ""The Van"" is pretty good but hardly salvages this overall muddled CD.Project Dead Man is stuck back in my player again for awhile. Incredible stuff, easily rivaling the best of Mike Clark's work with ICP. I think it's really good timing for him to come back and breathe some life into the recording again.Can't wait for The Tempest!"
5,This S**t is Krazy,"Well i've been a true Juggalo for many years now. And I've stuck around for all the changes never dissed PSYCHOPATHIC like a true JUGGALO Should..... Soopa Villianz is Krazy, like Heaven and Hell on earth At the same time fighting to win over this world ..Soopa Villianz is a good album to buy so buy it.. If your a true Juggalo go out and get it.. If not YOu'll Just be One of these a$$H*les with no life, who sit there behind there computer dissing us on [...]or anywhere elses."
2,Not so SOOPA after all...,"Yet another dissapointment in a soopa hyped release from PSY records. J really dropped the ball on this one...and I say J because he practically runs the place and is making most of the creative decisions now a days rather then everyone doing their own thing.This album is NOT wikked, it's basically techno rap...which is not as good as it may sound. I'll keep this one short because really, there isn't much to be said. The beats are lame, the style is insulting and annoying, and the overall theme was not needed. Frankly I would have been happy with an entire album like CONQOUR from PFOS2 sadly that's not what we were given."
1,I'm a die hard Juggalo and have to say...,"GET AWAY FROM THIS CLUB CRAP! This is ICP's second worst CD, Calm being the first worst.I know you want to be creative, but we aint diggin this crap. Oh and get ABK back on the flipping label, he has skills that no one else will use right (E-Sham is just better by himself).That's all I have to say."
4,"Space Case does not know what he,she,or it is talking about","Space Case is dumb. ABK is the best rapper on the physcopathic label. Esham is no longer with Physcopathic so this will be the last Soopa Villainz album with his weak style on it. Also check out ABK's albums Hatchet Warrior and Dirty History. Great Stuff. No one will miss Esham but If you miss the next supa villainz album your as stupid as ""Space Case*"". DJ Spork.*=retarded"
3,ESHAM A VIOLENT J DO THE BEST,shaggy 2 dope doesent even rap on thiz cd soopa heroz should be better because it has better artists on iT...
5,Super cd,Wow I can not believe what I have heard. I had very high expectations on this cd. When I opened and played I was blown away this hit the bar then raised it all the way up. If you have never bought an album from the clowns or esham then now is the time. THis cd is i think the best work to come out of pyschopathic records well except for maybe twiztid. This cd is just slamin. Much clown love.
1,Soopa Villianz,Not really much to say about this cd. The beats and style of this album are just terrible. The only song that I can play is So What. This very well could be the worst PSY release.
3,Good cover versions,"I've never been a big fan of the Deadline label. I still can't understand why they would rather have an act (L.A. Guns, Faster Pussycat, etc.) just re-hash their greatest hits, or make 'em sound worse by remixing them to the point of obliteration. That being said, I thought Mike Tramp's 'Remembering White Lion' is a pretty good album. While Tramp does go over familar territory, he gives some of these songs an stripped down approach. ""Wait"" has never sounded better and appears destined to be put on the soundtrack of an Adam Sandler movie. ""Living on the Edge,"" and ""Till Death Do Us Part,"" have a distinctive earthy feel to them as well. Granted, I probably could have lived without a ""She's got everything' and 'War Song' remake (because the originals off Maine Attraction were too damn good). But it could have been worse.. just listen to L.A. Guns Cocked and Re-Loaded and you'll see why."
2,"If it isn't broken, don't fix it !","I've been looking forward to this album since I heard it was in production, unfortunately my excitement ended the moment 'play' was pressed. Mike Tramp is an extremely talented guy, and his solo album 'Capricorn' is fantastic, but this offering proves you can't have 'White Lion' without Vito Bratta on the guitar. A selection of 12 songs (3 from each of the band's 4 albums) re-recorded without the oomph you would expect from such a project. This is the point where I say this CD is for only the ""Die Hard"" fan, but I am that fan, and I'm afraid this album will leave you nothing but disappointed."
2,Dissapoint is not enough word to say...,"Let's face it. For all of us who loved 80's heavy meatal this album shows that this guy Tramp just wanted to use ...the ""White Lion"" name once more (Last time, I pray!). It means just: keep of drinking that good ol' fresh water. His other solo works can be as good as he may want (Undoubtly he's a good singer/composer). Remember White Lion was the ""White"" Metal Band? (not as white as Stryper, but kind of good messages: positive, family, mankind, liberty, freedom, bla, bla) Whith the Lions' skull, this CD tries to get as ""grotesque"" as other bands, far from that feelin' they always were sending to their fans. Well, who knows? Maybe it's the symbol of the definitive White Lion's death. One minute of silence...P.S. Vito where are you?For all of us who saw in you a really guitar inspiration is so hard not having your Steinberger's sound. At least we have Vai and Satriani, but miss you a lot, because Halen's not out there either!"
2,No Good!,"I was a big fan of White Lion and still do listen to them to this day. I bought this cd and wished I hadn't. I did not like the changes made to all the songs. Just didn't like it, that's all I can say."
1,not for old fans,re-recordings of old classic white lion songs. vito bratta is not on bench.the new versions are almost terrible.better to listen old albums I grown with white lion but I am afraid to say that there won't be old white lion anymore.FAREWELL
5,A Good Brush-Up of Russian Vocabulary,"The vocabulary terms used here are basic ones, and there appear to be few if any technical terms. Although there are a thousand vocabulary words, many of them have multiple usages per card. For example, card 292 is kak (how, as), but also includes a listing of: kak budto (as if), kak-nibudt (somehow, sometime), and kak-tolko (as soon as).A booklet is included with the set of one thousand vocabulary cards. This booklet includes hints for usage of the cards for maximum benefit, as well as a listing of all thousand cards. This listing makes it easy to keep track of lost or missing cards, or for one person to quiz another directly from the list. One can, of course, also make an enlarged photocopy of this list and to check off the words that one does not know.The set of cards is very portable. All thousand cards fit into a 21 cm by 9.5 cm by 4 cm box. Each vocabulary card is 9 cm by 4 cm in size."
3,"Good content, poor quality.","PROS: The vocabulary cards are extensive and useful. One of the best features is the card gives you the word in English, and ALL the translations based on cases which, if you study Russian, you know can be quite a pain.CON: The cards are made with poor quality materials. At best, they remind me of badly printed business cards from a home printer. I wanted to be able to grab a handful and carry them with me in my pocket--glancing at them during ""down"" time throughout the day as an ongoing learning process. Unfortunately, the ""cards"" are so thin they become badly worn very quickly.SUMMARY: The cards are worth the 15 dollars--just dont' expect a durable product to arrive."
4,Quite good...,"I found these cards to be quite good. I would have preferred that they had been in order of frequency of usage rather than alphabetical. Having said that, they ARE the 1000 most common words. One small complaint is that the printing in the accompanying pamphlet was very faint and difficult to read. However when I phoned Vis-Ed, they immediately sent out a replacement. EXCELLENT customer service."
1,Great if you can read Russian,"I'm trying to learn Russian on my own. For some CRAZY reason every book/study aid I've bought that has vocabulary comes without a pronunciation key. These cards are no exception.The answers might as well have been written in hieroglyphics. Yes, I did study the alphabet and sounds each letter makes, but we all know sometimes words sound different than how they are spelled. There are stresses on the beginning or ending of the word that you might not pick up on unless you are told. Is a pronunciation key really too much to ask for? Apparently so, because only when I got the product did I realize ""the cards presupposes a working knowledge of Russian characters"".Great for people who have Russian speaker at their fingertips. My only choice is to look up each individual word and write in the pronunciation key myself. I'm so frustrated I could die."
4,"Cards are not ""plastified"".",Great cards. The only but is that I think they should be plastified to protect them from spots and dust and make them more durable.
5,Holsinger's Charlottesville: A Collection of Photographs,Wonderful book! I'm new to the area and learned so much about the history of Charlotetsville and UVA. Very Very Interesting and HIGHLY recommended!
5,The best!,"I really like this vitamin K2. Not really much of a taste at all, only slight. I will know more after I have taken it over a much longer period of time but so far, am really liking it."
5,Mammals species,I like to buy books in Amazon.com because is easy and there are a lot of good options. I recommend!
1,Mehaz Cuticle Nipper,I bought this item because I already have the same item and this one is definitively defective.......the middle of the handles does not keep the handles apart.......
1,Waste of Money; Frustrating to Use!,"I had the same issues as Bentley. I had a pair of Mehaz just like these and I loved them. But, they were old and getting dull. These are horrible, and have to be manually spread apart in order to use them. They are expensive and frustrating to use. A total waste of money."
1,good for a while,"during normal use the mechanism broke and the blades no longer line up correctly. Originally, the product worked great and have used about 2 years with no issues."
5,Classic Road Trip Music,"If there is one CD you must have for your summer road trip then Beat Pioneer by John Bowman is it.""Beat Pioneer"" is a theme CD in the spirit of The Who's ""Quadrophenia"". Every song tells a story and all the songs together tell the coming-of-age story of one young man.It's too bad this CD didn't have big label backing. It is an American classic rock and roll power pop record. Catchy melodies abound. It's kind of a Badfinger meets the Grateful Dead sound. It's worth every penny. I should know -- it's my record!"
4,"money, still a mystery, but a nice overview.","James Buchan has produced a history of money: thoroughly researched, scholarly,and accurate; But also, highly opinionated, literate and a joy to read. This is not the money of the economists or the financiers...this is the money of the writers and artists..... it probably wont help you make any money, but it will give you a lot to think about. Highly recommended."
5,The Best Book I have ever read!,This was the most life altering book I have ever read! I am now on my thrid reading of it just to be sure I didn't miss anything. It is written in such an easy to follow format and makes so much sense without getting confusing. I am on today to order 4 more copies for friends who will so love this book as I have - I can't part with mine!
5,Enlightening,"I LOVE this book and feel very grateful to have come in contact with it. A real life-changer - it becomes easier to move in a more natural, positive direction! Do not underestimate the power of the insights possessed in this book, stated in simple language."
5,"beautiful item, but a little expensive......","i like very much, my garden look beautiful and i think it's a little expensive, but i made a great purchase...great seller, i will keep this seller..."
3,Gooder than some,"Matt Braun does a good job of throwing in a bit of history, language, and metaphor into a somewhat predictable and lackluster plot about a couple of range detective hired to track and return a stolen bull, which really is a summary of the plot. Not much else weaves its way around or through their mission, and everything that happens the reader sees coming as if on the open plains with ten miles of unobstructed view. That said, I did still enjoy some of the metaphors and language he used, even if at times it seemed like it was being overused, you know, just for the sake of using it, as if he had himself a checklist of words and phrases to throw in."
3,workmanlike but not too gripping,"Matt Braun in this ealier work hasnt reached the finesse of his later books. This is a simple story of 2 ""goodies"" versus the ""baddies"" and its very clear throughout who will win virtually unscathed ,in the end.Sure we expect our Westerns to end up the way we want , with good defeating evil,and we are rarely disappointed.Worth a read because he does write good stuff."
1,BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD!!!,"If Amazon[.com] ever posts the cover of this DVD, don't let it fool you. The attractive women on the cover are not the women on the disc. The entire budget must have been spent on buying pictures for the cover to fool prospective buyers because they sure didn't spend it on this cheap video (the DVD is actually a collection of 3 SHORT videos-""British Starbirds: Leather, Lace and Lingerie Vol. 1, 2 & 3""). 79 min. total running time."
5,NuTone Vacuum hose,I broke my current hose and the product that came was better than theoriginal hose with my unit. Would buy again!
5,Insightful and entertaining,"I took my time reading The Happiness Solution. Savored it like a fine meal. It is one of those books that you can open at any page and find something useful enough to ponder or just stop complaining and get on with your day. I recommend it for anyone's library just for the stories alone.--Doug Setter, Bachelor of Human Ecology,Author of One Less Victim and Stomach Flattening"
5,Beat the struggling economy by being happy in a messed up world,"Alan helps us to turn our life around literally by changing the way we think. With the econonmy in such turmoil sadness and depression are more rampant than ever. Many people are losing their jobs, their homes, due to the credit crisis and natural disasters. With Alan's book you can read real stories that will help you to have a different outlook and bring more joy into your life, no matter what your circumstances are."
4,I love UFOs!,"I find videos like this highly entertaining. This is probably the best of all the UFO videos I have seen. Although I do not believe aliens crashed at Roswell, and I don't believe the government is reverse-engineering extraterrestrial flying saucers, and I don't believe the abduction stories, I find the subject matter to be very interesting. This is probably the most compelling video on the subject; but until I see a crashed saucer or an alien corpse, I will remain in the skeptic camp."
3,nothing new,"as someone that's looked into the ufo scene intensely around right before this video came out, I thought I'd was going to be seeing new earth shattering footage and interviews.. really a lot of this stuff on the video can be found all over the web.. though it's ok for those who don't know much on the subject. I can't believe they were initially charging such a hefty price for rehashed video footage.."
1,Forever a mystery,"At $109 a pop (today's listed price for the DVD), it is entirely possible, if not completely likely, that I will have an encounter with a real UFO before I ever see this video."
1,Something funny here,I also ordered this d v d a while ago at a much smaller price.I hope the buying public knows there being ripped off at this price.Why are their copies selling now for 150.00 and 200.00 dollars.Why have they now stopped production on the film. I payed 22.00 for the first copy i bought.Did you see and hear the guy on Fox News about two years ago that published it.All i'm saying is there is something funny about the whole thing.The one star is for the way this whole thing has been handled.I liked the film and should have given it more thought before i put in one star.
3,Good documentary,"This is a good film, but I found James Fox's more recent ""I Know What I Saw"" much better (a 5 star). Definitely buy ""I Know What I Saw"" - it's more sophisticated, better made technically, documents the best UFO sightings, very good music, etc. But having said that, I still like Out of the Blue. Also, I found ""Phoenix Lights"" exceptionally good (another 5 star) - on par with I Know What I Saw. I personally have all 3."
5,Outstanding UFO Documentary,Maybe the best UFO documentary I've ever seen. Can't wait for the upcoming sequel.
3,"Interesting book, but a lot of redundant information","This is a good book about the evolution and the workings of the modern Hollywood system. (For summaries, see the other reviews.) I enjoyed the first third of the book a lot, but then it became more and more repetitive. A lot of the information contained in Part 4 (""The Economic Logic of Hollywood""), Part 5 (""Social Logic""), and Part 6 (""Political Logic"") had been already presented in the preceeding parts. For example, I don't know how many times Epstein mentions the 29 million USD Arnold Schwarzenegger received for ""Terminator 3"" - it sure seems like a million times. In the end, you get the impression that the author had access to more detailed information about a limited number of movies (T3, Gone in 60 seconds) and then used them as examples for each and every point he is trying to make. All in all, some serios editing would have turned this really good book into an excellent one."
5,Very good,"If you want to learn about Hollywood's past and how Hollywood works from A to Z in terms of business YOU WANT THIS BOOK. It really dwelves into the busines side, and since Hollywood isall about BUSINESS first - eveyrone should read this first before beginning starting off in this biz."
4,a good book about recent changes in the industry,"Edward Jay Epstein's book provides an excellent overview of how business has changed in Hollywood since the 1970s. The book will give the reader a chance to think about how the industry moderates its relentless pursuit of money occasionally in order to pursue loftier goals. The book is particular strong in identifying key industry leaders, such as Lew Wasserman, who were able to respond quickly to changing circumstances and to rebuild the studio system in a new form after the rise of television. For a more complete history of the studio system, see Douglas Gomery's recently published book. But this one is a good read and it does a good job of recounting the recent history of the industry."
3,"Somewhat schizophrenic selection, overpriced","If you can find this CD in the states for less than $15, go for it. It's a pretty solid introduction to T. Rex, although the song selection, from '71-'77, is a bit schizophrenic. It does, however, contain tunes like ""Light Of Love"" and ""Debora"", which most T. Rex anthologies usually skip. I would just get into the real stuff and pick up 2 or 3 T. Rex albums, beginning with ""Electric Warrior"" and moving on to ""The Slider"" and ""Futuristic Dragon."""
1,"Arrived dirty & scratched, with machining grease inside","This is the second Bialetti stovetop coffeemaker that I've ordered in the last two weeks that has arrived scratched up and dirty. This one had machining grease in the top chamber which was easily noticeable after one swipe with a paper towel. The shape is such that there was no way I could get it clean without putting it in the dishwasher, which you aren't supposed to do. I don't know what's going on here, but something seems to be awry in the factory. I ordered the first one, a different model, on Amazon through a third party, and the second one was this model direct from Amazon."
1,not durable,"Due to the leaking problem that other reviewers mentioned, I always have to screw the top on very securely. However, this makes it difficult to open again, and now the handle is coming off. For $40 a ""coffee pot"" should last longer than this."
4,Great Design!,Picked this for the stainless steel body and design. The only drawback is most burners are much larger than pot so difficult to heat w/out scorching the handle.
3,Works but shoddy manufacturing,"I've had a couple moka pots and while this one seems to work fairly well, it's very evident that outsourcing the manufacturing on these from Italy (some Bialetti are still made there) to India has caused quality to suffer. The stamped logo is crappy, the lid hinges are crooked and the pin that holds the lid to the hinge is slightly bent and works it's way half way out each time it's used. The moka pot works fairly well but at this quality it should have been about half as much. This takes longer to heat up than an aluminum moka pot and I did notice that it doesn't like my gas stove tops nearly as much as electric and I think that because the base is so small the gas ring on the stove is almost bigger than the base so you need to keep it on a small burner with the flame on medium to low. The product works, it's just a shame that you can definitely tell the quality has suffered by being made in India rather than the usual quality manufacturing that Italy produces."
5,"""A Little Learning Is a Dangerous Thing""",4 European Cups (a two ounce tasse) is only 8 ounces of espresso. This is just about right for two tall Lattes. This is soooo good. I love mine.
2,bad quality lid,"I really liked the design and the fact it is made or stainless steel. however, the lid felt flimsy and crooked so I returned it right away."
4,"Good stainless espresso maker, but many scrathes iniside.","I am not sure where the scratches inside came from, but I like it because the stainless espresso maker is much healthier than an aluminium one."
3,Great when it works...,"I had to re-order the item three times to finally receive a good one. The first one came with a broken handle, the second one with a leaking valve...Funny when you think that Chrysler is now going to get the Italian technology (sic). In all fairness, Fiat won't get much from Chrysler either."
1,Always leaks. ALWAYS!,"Do not fall for this.I did not buy mine from amazon, but from a shop.Making coffee so that you don't end up half of the water leaking from the joint on to the stove top is IMPOSSIBLE.Very very, very very product."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the worst video I've ever seen! It's poorly taped, some of the people don't seem to know what they're talking about, and the few pictures of Godsmack that are on the video are flashed on and off the screen about a thousand different times. I can't believe that I wasted money on this..."
1,I would rather have my fingernails RIPPED OUT!!,I will be short and sweet. I would rather have my fingernails RIPPED OUT than watch this again. This is the worst [DVD] I have ever seen. One star is the lowest rating you can give. that is unfortunate. It deserves Zero Stars. Maybe even negative numbers. This DVD was a bunch of nobodies being interviewed about Godsmack. No interviews with the band and No music. Save your money. This DVD is not worth [$$$]. It was VERY hard to watch. It was a big waste of money.
1,DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!!!!!,"For anyone that's a real fan of Godsmack, you can live without this DVD. You never hear from anyone in the band, you hear no music, you see no videos. It sucks pretty much. They interview people who say they knew Godsmack before they hit it big, etc., etc. I am so dissappointed that I wasted my money on this. Hold out for the 2 new live DVD's Godsmack is putting out soon. They were filmed this summer on their tour with the Deftones (who suck by the way!!)"
3,"It's worth it, but nothing to die over...","I was rushing through the stores everywhere to find this DVD. I was going crazy, just to get my hands on it(asking store clerks everywhere if they had it), No luck. Well finally I got my hands on it after about having 10 or 12 heart attcks trying to find it.I was fixing to die. But, as soon as I got home, I opened it and popped it in the DVD player. UHHHHHHHH..... This is so not what I suspected, at all. It's ok, if you like watching people (hardly any Godsmack) talk/ I was disapointed about the quality. But it's ok. I wouldn't recommend it. But if you have alot of money to spend/(burn), you should get it, but on the other hand if you only have enough to spend on this ( don't buy it)..."
5,Get Em Started Early,Both my sons played hockey and their little sister lived at the rink watching their practices and games. My advice to parents is the younger you get em started the more fun they'll have and the better players they'll be. This is a great book to get them interested early. The story line and illustrations will have them begging you to read this over and over. My wife and I spent 14 years watching our sons play and now my son's a coach and our grandson plays. I can't think of a better book to get your child started.
5,The Five-String Guitar,"The Five-String Guitar gives a most unique presentation on 5 books in the bible. They are like the different strings of a guitar; distinct yet able to be played in total harmony with each other. Although not one note of music is played, you will be pleasantly enlightened by the harmonious sounds of scriptural truths and creative musical insight of the author.~I received a complimentary copy of The Five-String Guitar as a member of theDorrance Publishing Book Review Team. Visit dorrancebookstore.comto learn how you can become a member of the Book Review Team."
2,beautiful yet bland,"being a fan of goodman's first two books, i was eager to read the drowning tree where juno mckay is piecing together the mysterious death of her best friend. however, i had to put it back on the shelf after getting halfway submerged in the story. goodman's descriptions are as immersing and alluring as ever, but the plot moves at a slow motion pace as if goodman is wading against a current, the weight of the water preventing any real progress in her story's development. of course, goodman knows what she is doing: she is slowly enlightening the reader through juno's eyes. unfortunately, it gets to the point where you really don't care what juno is going to find."
4,Literary thriller,"If you liked Goodman's earlier novels set at Penrose College, you'll enjoy this one, too. Alumni Christine Webb researches a famous stained glass window at the college that brings to light several facts of history that some wish would remain secret. Her friend and fellow alum Juno tries to unravel the mystery and gets into danger herself."
4,The Drowning Tree,"Although boring and hard to follow with all of the art and mythology stories, it was overall a pretty good book."
3,Why the present tense?,"""The Drowning Tree"" has much to recommend it. But why oh why does Carol Goodman have to write in the present tense? It's irritating, and I really had to push myself through the book."
2,"No spark, no sizzle.","I enjoyed Goodman's first two academic gothic mysteries quite a lot but this one never even achieves sufficient spark to fizzle out. The book never clicks, there's nothing for the reader to go for. Well, there is one thing and I thought it finest kind -- the underwater sculpture garden. That could have been so cool ... but, in the end, wasn't enough."
1,Twaddle,"Just because the author throws in some mythology, does not mean this book offers any kind of intelligent reading. I found it to be typical, modern day twaddle. Did not finish it..made it to about page 75..could not even make myself skim read the rest."
3,Kept me reading,"I enjoyed this book because: the writing was very good, the characters were real, and the descriptions of the art works (although by the end I was tired of them) are fascinating.However, it was only because of the above that I was willing to accept the contrived plot, the cliche of the handsome detective and all the parallels between the 19th century story and the modern story.I guess this is a ""gothic,"" and had I known that I wouldn't have bought it and then I would have missed a good read.So, with those cautions, I recommend it."
3,Doesn't stand up well,"I haven't decided if I'm going to return this Chinese made product. It is not meeting my needs. It's longer than I expected which wouldn't be a problem except it doesn't stay up very well so if clothes are tossed in they can collapse the bag. You have to lift the bag up for it to appear need while holding dirty clothes. I have limited space in my apt,thought this would be light weight to carry to the washer and that I could line them up on top of the washer dryer and use them there. They just don't fit anywhere for me."
2,Disappointing,"I was so excited when I ordered two of these baskets. I had just installed a closet organizer and had left enough room at the bottom for a hamper; the dimensions of this one allowed me to fit two and to maximize my use of space. Unfortunately, they don't stand open like the photo shows. Instead, they collapse in, which means you have to bend over and stand them up again to put clothes in them. I realize that being collapsible is a nice feature, but they need a sturdier frame that locks into the upright position in order to be very practical."
5,AWESOME,"I have bought many of these bags, because everyone in my extended family wants at least one and keeps taking them! They are wonderful for our road trips, holding everything from shoes and coats, games and toys, to laundry on the way back. They are sturdy, durable and super-convenient. If you are buying one, buy a few. You will find a million uses for them (and someone in YOUR family will want to ""borrow"" one-and never give it back LOL)"
3,A Must For The Terminally Curious!,"I got this little kit a few months ago. What interested me was a visit to New Orleans. And to that famous VooDoo queen Marie LeVeau. I learned that it is for fun and entertainment and the little doll who comes with pins is cute but I don't believe I'll be trying to put a spell on anyone. Relieve stress any way you can. If this helps, great!"
2,Not Worth It,"It does not save time and energy. It is not worth the price.It took me about the same time to cook the beef stew using a regular pot( Anolon Nonstick pot).There is no big difference between the regular pot and this pot, but the price is a big difference.So, I sent it back to Amazon for a refund."
3,"A couple of important points made, not elaborated on enough","He made the important point of self-image and protecting self-image and the lengths people will go to do this, hurting themselves and others. It also pointed out we all do this to some level, but for others it is a seriously harmful problem. He is willing to address ""bad behavior"" in a time when only the positive is acceptable."
1,lifetime therapy,"I read this book and it stays with me. Any therapist who admits to years of having treated a patient with NO success, is facing a moral or intellectual issue of his own. This man is incredible. The patients that he believes to be evil seem more to be manipulative people who want attention, and do not want to address their issues. And Doctor Peck is right there to enable them and tells their stories.People of the Lie: The Hope for Healing Human Evil"
5,For those who seek understanding of 2011,This book provides for those who seek an understanding of how we got to where we are in 2011 an answer and some guidance on how to get out of this mess . . . if you are willing to look. Reading and acting on an individual basis is much better than the lost Occupy Wall Street Movement.
3,Problems,"I am a fan of Scott Peck's work - however there is a problem with this book: he leans on the writings of Malachi Martin. Now at the time he wrote the book he was not to know any better, but since the publication of the memoir by Time magazine's Robert Blair Kaiser (""Clerical Error: A True Story"", Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002) there are good reasons to doubt much of what was previously believed to be known about Malachi Martin, and certainly to be suspicious of his ""factual"" writings.So as a result ""People of the Lie"" contains a flaw, perhaps a fatal flaw."
3,"Heal evil: take personal responsibility, treat narcissism","In ""People of the Lie,"" Scott Peck repeatedly asks the reader - and the field of psychiatry - to first of all acknowledge that there is such a thing as evil, secondly to give it a psychiatric diagnosis (he maintains that evil properly falls under narcissistic personalty disorder), and thirdly to begin facing and treating evil.Although both Peck's writing style and general outlook are authoritarian and unabashedly patriarchial (God, he says, is masculine; but Satan has no gender), nevertheless he deserves credit for courageously examining the most fearful question in the human heart: What is evil? What are its characteristics? How do we counter evil? However, the book that best answers these questions is the current book by Robert Sardello, Freeing the Soul From Fear."
3,"'People of the Lie', by M. Scott Peck","This book has been widely acclaimed--and is largely over-rated. After making some very astute observations about the manifestations of evil in certain personalities, Peck tends to become increasingly inarticulate. He is at his best when he devotes his attention to his philosophy that there are individuals who are inherently evil, and his methods of spotting such people. However, the remainder of the book is largely anecdotal and repetitive, and deteriorates increaslingly as Peck attempts to describe his feelings and observations of individual encounters with the subjects of his work. It isn't always possible to 'see' the evil he tries so hard to describe."
3,People of the Lie,"The Book arrived early, and in real good shape. It was not what I expecting. A friend recommend the book. I did read it. It was not bad, just not for me."
2,"Interesting, but I have to agree with Merlin from London...","I like the way Peck writes and his experiences are interesting, but I think his conclusions are a bit dramatic. I understand why a religious person would want to label people as ""evil"", simply because they do believe a satanic entity, but I think it is just animalistic behavior coming out in a person. We are still all animals when it comes right down to it, some better trained than others, and some more intelligent than others. There is a sad undertone to this book, and it is associated with the author. It makes you hope he heals himself."
3,"Results oriented ""science""","Peck is writing like Freud long after it is ok to practice ""science"" using anecdotal evidence. This methodology is highly suspect and cannot be used to prove any theory. The theory Peck sets out to prove -- that a Christian conception of evil exists -- is itself suspect because he approaches it from the biased perspective of a believer. As a work of science and medicine it is therefore not worth the paper it is written on. Nevertheless, I give it three stars because it is a good read, and it is interesting. The anecdotes tell you as much about Peck as they do about his subjects."
1,Unintentionally hilarious,"Two words summarise this book: Abject nonsense. With the marked exception of the chapter on Vietnam, which is suprising insightful and sensitive. Which makes the ludicrous ramblings of the other chapters all the more baffling!"
1,A sensationalist title and not a lot else!,"So here we have yet again , another medical professional recounting tales of his encounters with patients , anything to make a quick buck. Peck himself says that he should have entitled the book"" ...... good and evil"" but somehow the evil standing alone is a little bit more exciting. Peck is another dysfunctional professuinal theorist who knows it all intellectually, who knows what applys to everybody else but he himself is somehow above it all. He would like us to believe that the patients he has failed to heal are somehow evil , even more proposperous he would like us to do so in the name of progress. I became angry and sad with this book. It's language is devoid of compassion, reeks of melodrama and in the end doesn't offer anything new about anything. I suspect Dr. Peck to be one of the very people he would like us to be more aware of. The book is certainly a lie"
2,A book full of opinions,"Peck discusses scientific study of evil in the book, yet this book is full of nothing more than Peck calling whatever he doesn't like ""evil."" The case studies used certainly are severely disturbed people, but I would hesitate to call them ""evil."" He talks about how his repulsion of certain people is an indication that they are evil. I was certainly repulsed by his opinions and treatment of people in desperate need of help. Does this mean Peck is evil? According to his definition, it does. Judging a person as ""bad"" is one thing, but so liberally applying the label to ""evil"" to whomever he chose is not only immoral but irresponsible as well. The book does get one thinking about what ""evil"" really is, but for all the wrong reasons."
1,Sensationalistic,"Although the book is full of disclaimers that attempt to let the author off the hook, the overall tone of Peck's writing lends itself well to paranoia and witch-hunting. You are apt to see evil people of the lie hiding under every rock after reading this book, and might even conclude yourself as one.There are sound books available on the subject of narcissism (a psychological concept) and there are religion-based books which deal well with the concept of human evil. This book tries to be both, but is neither.Sensationalistic books are usually fondly received at first and then later become dated because they are not sound enough to stand up to the test of time. May it be mercifully so with this one."
2,"More Psychology, Less Religion","The book, which I'll admit I didn't finish, had interesting anecdotes, but the religious component(which sneaks up on you, and goes on forever) makes it dry and tedious."
1,This book was profoundly disappointing,"I am amazed at how lame this book is. It is ambiguous as to what exactly the definition of evil is. Is this just the authors own idea of what evil is because it is certainly not fact based? Is this something he tried to come up with to make money because people respected the first books he had written? How is it that he could lable someone evil and not address mental illness? This is childish name calling. But that makes me the ""dummy"" doesn't it....I, after all, spent money on this book."
5,One of Peck's Best,"""People of the Lie"" is one of Scott Peck's best books. It's stated purpose is to open discussion on the subject of human evil. (Evil is biophobic -- life destroying, while good is biophylic -- life giving.) Peck divides the subject well, and conveys his concepts by way of stories. People who, on the outside seem good, can be evil. This book isn't written in academic language, and is understandable by anyone interested in the subject of human evil. It does, however, require some concentration in places, as the subject is non-trivial. I strongly recommend it for anyone interested in how to recognize and deal with evil, and, of course, for any of Peck's many fans. Note this is a 1998 printing of a 1980's book. However, the only indication of this is some discussion of events in the Vietnam war. All else is sufficiently timeless so that era is not identifiable."
5,People of the Lie - A Wakeup Call,"You have to have known the evil that is described by Dr. Peck to understand what he has written. Once known you have to acknowledge it. This type of evil surrounds us in everyday life. These people are everywhere. They are to be pitied. They are fearful and they are to be feared. They cause incredible pain in those surrounding them. They are masters in their disquises. They go to extreme lengths to maintain their ""image"". For they know deep within themselves that they are evil. They appear to be upstanding citizens. They are noted to be outstanding parents and good employees. These people will sacrifice anyone for their own gain. Their spouse, their children and their parents. Nothing or no one gets in their way. I believe that is what makes them evil. They have no remorse, no conscience and no regrets. What do you do when you have these people in your life? Pray."
3,Perplexed,"This book was recommended by my psychologist - I could relate to several parts of several stories in the book. I was so disturbed by the stories, however, that I could not finish the book. I let a friend who was recovering from surgery borrow it and I hadn't mentioned a word to her about how it was and she brought it back to me yesterday and said she couldn't finsih it because it made her feel weird. It's a great book - Peck telling true stories of clients that he's seen over the years - but it's certainly not a happy go lucky by any means. I hope to finish it later this year."
4,Good book - A bit harder to read than some of his others,His books are so insightful and life changing. He said things that I had never heard anyone else say. I have learned so much and they have brought me a measure of peace because he said things I suspected but did not read/hear any one else saying. I am so grateful to have gotten his books..I highly recommend his books. I wish someone had bothered to tell me a LONG TIME AGO.
4,Excellent,"This is not a comfortable book to read and can leave you feeling unpleasant. M Scott Peck reveals the truth and uses language and terms to discribe how evil this category of people are. It is validating to know I was not crazy when I was exposed to people of the lie. Disturbing to read, but very necessary."
3,A different way of looking at things,"While the book is a bit more religious than I expected, it is excellent in its insight. I can understand why Peck continues to be read and re-read by those seeking to break the cycles of their past. Even for those that are not Christian, Peck has an intriguing take on exorcism and evil as it appears in man. Intriguing.I recognize that some of the reviews are very negative and some are very positive. I think from a pyscho-therapy how-to stand point this may not be the best book to read. However, from a day to day, trying to understand ""how the mind attempts to justify certain aspects of life"" or ""how to break your habits of not being able to see your own reality clearly"", there is a lot to be said for what this book can help to illustrate.I'm giving it 3 stars because it probably should address both audiences but really is designed more for the non-professional reader."
3,Who is Satan?,"Here is a psychiatrist and bestselling author of _The Road Less Travelled_ claiming to have witnessed a manifestation of Satan during an exorcism. He is convinced that Satan is no mere legend or mythical character. Satan, the devil, the Evil One, literally exists.Dr. Peck's conviction is great enough that he proposes to revise the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to include a diagnosis of possession.Although the evidences for Satan's manifestation that Peck cites have merit they are anecdotal rather than scientific. While they may point to some 'demonic' phenomenon, Peck's Christian predisposition biases his judgment towards simply affirming medieval Christian beliefs.As a counterpoise, I suggest Elaine Pagel's _The Origin of Satan_"
2,Too difficult to read,This book is not an easy read. It a collection of experiences encountered by the author but the flow tends to be all over the place.
3,People of the Lie,I ordered this book because it was recommended to me. It was not what I expected but it was alright.
1,The devil is your own animal side or ego not an outside force,"This book sadly is the diametric opposite of Peck's first classic book, A Road Less Traveled. I believe that his first book stated it correctly, evil is not an outside force or external locus of control. Evil is not an outside force of an anthropomorphic ""devil"" as this book suggests. Instead, evil is symbolized by the metaphoric stories of devils which in reality were employed by Manifestations of God or Prophets to describe our own narcissism, ego, ""satanic self"" or animal side versus our angelic or spiritual side. Our ""free will"" makes the choice between our animal or spiritual sides. Evil is best described by the works of Gary L. Matthews. There can be collective evil egos or animalistic intents as well. Alas, People of the Lie is problably the worst book I have ever read, while his first book is among the best I have read, the sales differences between the two tell the story."
1,Peck might as well burn us at the stake!,"oh my goodness, this book continues the age old ignorance of labeling the mentally ill as possessed...Perhaps it is easier to label patients as evil then to admit that analysis can't help someone with a biological problem...diabetics used to be labeled as 'possessed' before the discovery of insulin, manic-depressives are regulated by lithium, yet Peck would label such a soul, a person seeking help from a medical doctor as 'evil' since obviously Peck can not cure these diseases by 'talk therapy' - I'm shocked and outraged. Peck repent!"
5,Required reading,"I believe this book ought to be required reading for anyone who's considering becoming a parent, considering being born to a parent or a pair of them, contemplating being a brother, sister aunt or uncle or maybe having a wife, husband or friend.The book is about power, manipulation, boundaries, lies and evil as they exist within ourselves and the people around us. They don't require that we believe in them to exist, but if we're able to recognize them for what they are it helps. Recognizing it doesn't make it easy, but it makes it possible.Peck's premises mightn't be entirely correct, as some suggest. But whether it's 'evil' or merely something not evil that could get a job being evil if there was such an occupation, Peck's approach works.I recommend this book for anyone who knows, loves, cares about and lives with the agonies of the phenomenon Peck calls 'evil'."
2,"""People of the Lie"", a difficult book to read","I have always read Scott Peck's books with delight, especially The Road Less Travelled. That is why it was with great expectations that I bought People of the Lie. My expectations, howevever, were not met, especially because he talks of people who are evil.It is true that the cases he brings as examples (i.e. the parents of a suicide teenager who give their other son the suicide gun as a present) do make his point. However, I have difficulties seeing some of the people around me as evil. Even those who make terrible mistakes and cause significant pain to others I tend to see as lost souls in search of meaning in their lives. What these people show us is what others at some point have done to them. I see their behavior as a learned experience and not as incarnated evil. Eventually, some of them will see the pain they inflict on others and make ammends, while others will continue to be blind. In anyways, these are not evil people, they are people in pain."
4,Easy to relate,"People of the Lie offers an interesting look into the psychology of chronic liars and helps one to understand what to do when confronted with such lies. I really liked the personal stories that the author included in the book. The only negative critique I would give was the introduction was incredibly boring. I almost stopped reading after the first 10-15 pages of introduction because he uses a lot of psychology jargon and it's hard to understand. But once the book officially starts, it's very engaging and a fast read. Loved the book and I would consider reading more by the same author."
4,The Psychology of Evil,"Dr. Peck believes that evil is a form of mental illness. He defines evil ""as the use of power to destroy the spiritual growth of others for purpose of defending and preserving the integrity of our own sick selves. In short, it is scapegoating."" He also believes that narcissism and laziness are the roots of all evil. In an evil personality type the main defect is the ability to recognize sin in themselves and they lie to themselves to keep from seeing it. They also tend to judge others as evil. Decent people are naturally revolted by evil. Adults who become involved in a relationship with someone who is evil do so because of their own evil. The way to overcome evil is by love.Dr Peck rejects the Augustinian notion of evil as the absence of goodness and I think this is where Dr Peck goes wrong. He seems to reject this notion because of his belief in a literal form of demonic possession."
5,I rrecommend this book over and over,"Scott Peck's best, if not most famous, work.If you find yourself baffled by the behavior of people around you, or dealing with the after math of some traumatic experience, this book may show you just what is going on. Once you read it you cannot ever go back and be ignorant of what Peck lays out.I also recommend (for a more Jungian take) Sanfords ""Jung and the Problem of Evil."" .Jung and the Problem of Evil: The Strange Trial of Mr. HydeSanford references Peck and vice versa. but if you need to understand evil and how it operates in the world... this book is without a single competitor"
5,Scott Peck sees things clearly.,"I am an incest survivor. This book described my family. Scary. Validated the tough choices I had made in my life. Helped me feel better about having made those choices. Scott Peck sees things clearly, and helps you see them clearly also."
4,Truth is sometimes difficult,"Most people should read this book to learn about and be forewarned about those around them who seem so nice, but cause great difficulty for themselves and for others thinking they are benefiting their own standard of heightened importance."
4,Totally confirmed my suspicians about Mr. Peck,"Years ago I tried to read 'The Road Less Traveled' but felt there was more to him than that book showed. In 'People of the Lie', readers will see him more clearly. Although I couldn't disagree more with his premise of labeling any human being as ""evil"" and especially his patients, I must admit he does give accurate accounts of how people subtly live lies and perpetuate them to the frustration of the unwitting. Other reviews have given plenty of detail on this book but I feel it necessary to add that he leads to reader into an exorcism that only serves to prove its inanity. I now see Mr. Peck as a very angry person who disguises his contempt of humanity behind quietly well-articulated dogmatism. In this book, he stands with the rules of the Catholic Church behind his contempt, and his conclusions make me question why anyone else would want to join such miserable company -- not least, in a psychiatrist!"
4,People of the Lie review,"I have not read the entire book, but have read several pages throughout the book. It is not exactly what I was told by a friend that it would be, however, it is a very interesting, educational book."
1,Ouch!,"Having read ""The Road less traveled"" - I was sure I'd love to read ""People of the lie"" but only later I realised that in this book M.Scott Peck spoke his obscure thoughts that none but him can understand!I felt really bad reading about his former patients and being so judgemental towards them without any strong good reasons. Especially with the patient named George!M. Scott Peck warned us that this book is dangerous. Perhaps he meant stupid but he just couldn't say that for his own book."
1,It's just a book about a doctor in love with his patient,"The basic premise of the book is an emotionally troubled patient named Charlene tried for years to seduce him as part of a power game and he calls that ""evil"" when she quit seeing him. It is painfully obvious he is in love with her and it seems very inappropriate for a doctor, trying to get in touch with a former psych patient, goes the the lengths of writing a book. I wonder if it worked and she got back in touch wih him--inquiring minds want to know."
1,Waxing Loquacious!,"What a silly book. The term Waxing Loquacious really doesn't capture just how ineffective and pointless this book is. If the diagnosis ""Evil"" ever came to fruition, as the author advocates, nobody would dare seek counseling, and the business of psychiatry would be history. The author does a great job of demonstrating just how mentally dysfunctional and abusive psychologists and psychiatrists can be to people who are hurting. Here's what the author is really saying: Let's make the diagnosis ""Evil"" available to psychiatrists and make psychiatric treatment mandatory for everyone who qualifies as an imperfect human being. Then psychiatrists could diagnose everyone as ""Evil"" and rule the world as living gods. The road less traveled wasn't bad, but 'People of the lie' will only serve to harm the author's credibilty in intellectual arenas, as his logic is truly lazy."
1,As bad as Road Less Traveled was good,"I was deeply moved when I read Dr. Peck's ""The Road Less Traveled,"" and sought out this book for further enlightenment. I was sorely disappointed, and to this day I have trouble believing that these two books were penned by the same author.People of the Lie is a collection of case studies of troubled people who need help. Many of them are seeking that help when they enlist the services of Dr. Peck, who seems to have lost his sense of compassion. Most of these patients are suffering, but the best Dr. Peck can offer is to label them as, among other things, evil. I fail to see how this can help any patient, and this book has nothing to offer those whose goal is personal growth. Instead, read The Road Less Traveled."
1,"Not a Null Modem adapter, Just a Gender Changer.","Product would have been fine if i needed a gender changer, but I ordered a null modem adapter and the tape around the connectors said it was but the pins were all straight connections. I bought this so I wouldn't have to dig out an old 20' null modem cable but had to resort to that all the same since this didn't give me the cross talk like i needed."
1,"Not a Null Modem, Simply a F/F Adapter","I ordered two of these adapters, and after scratching my head trying to figure out what I was doing wrong I rang out the pins with a Multi-Meter and discovered that they were wired straight through. Namely, pin 2 goes to pin 2 and pins 3 goes to pin 3. They work great as F/F adapters though....."
1,NOT a Null Modem Adapter,"Despite what the description says and as some of the other reviewers have pointed out... this is NOT a null modem adapter, it is just a straight-through F/F gender changer. Pin outs are exactly the same on each side. (Wondering if the picture in the description is wrong as it shows an orange band around the adapter yet the one I received has a bright yellow band that states: ""Mini Gender Changer"".)"
1,Good Gender Bender - NOT a null modem,"Verified these are straight through gender benders, not null modem adapters. Irritating since by the time I discovered it they were needed. My bad for not testing first, but still false labeling."
1,NOT a NULL MODEM adapter,"To all who have reviewed this product and stated that it is a proper functioning NULL MODEM adapter, one (or more) of the following is true:1. You did not receive the same product as the rest of the reviewers2. You do not know what a NULL MODEM adapter is (visit www dot nullmodem dot com to become educated)3. You had another NULL MODEM cable/adapter in series and didn't realize it when you added this to the cablingI disassembled it and all pins are straight through connections. A NULL MODEM adapter DOES NOT provide straight through connections! This is a Female/Female RS-232 adapter. Period.I'm extremely disappointed in Amazon for misrepresenting this product."
1,Not a Null Modem,"This is not a Null Modem. The package and text on the DB9 says it is a null modem, but I have tested it and it is a straight thru connector."
1,Not a null adapter!,"As everyone else has stated, this is not a null modem adapter just a female/female converter. Junk to me now... Amazon really needs to get this listing fixed."
1,not a null modem,"Despite the reviews I decided to try it (my luck) out. The one I got had orange sticker with null modem printed on top. Guess what, it is just a mislabeled gender changer. I even checked with a multimeter. Do not waste your time on this unless you want a gender changer."
5,Very nice!,"I don't know what the people who wrote ""this is not a null modem"" are talking about.I did have a similar piece in the past that had yellow band with a label that said ""gender change"".THIS one has an orange band and the label specifically says ""mini adapter / null modem"" - and it is indeed pretty sweet!So if you are looking for a null modem + gender change all in one - this item will do the job.I really like the fact that it is so small and does the job of two adapters/converters I had to use in the past."
1,Not a null modem adapter,"I should have read the reviews before purchasing. I ordered 6 and they were labeled NULL MODEM, but they turned out to simply be gender changers."
1,This product is MISREPRESENTED - DO NOT BUY,"This product is MISREPRESENTED - DO NOT BUY!This is a straight-thru F/F gender changer. It is not a NULL modem as its description inaccurately depicts.Seller, you MUST change this deceptive description."
1,Not a Null Modem Adapter,"Despite being sold, and labeled as, a null modem adapter, pins 2 and 3 are straight through. Unfortunately I wasted 45 minutes troubleshooting software and serial port settings before breaking out the multi-meter to verify pin wiring on this adapter.Look elsewhere (unless you need a simple DB-9 gender changer)."
5,"Works as expected, durable.",This has worked well for me to extend a connection from a fire alarm system to a monitoring station. It was durably constructed and performed as advertised.
5,null modem adapter,"I was pleased with the null modem adapter. I was concerned that it should meet the standards for a null modem cable, but after testing all the pin to pins, I found it made all the right connections. This is a handy adapter to go along with the modern USB to male DB9 cables used for serial communication. Adding this adapter makes the overall cable a regular null modem cable."
3,Mini Null Modem Adapter F to F,Bought this adapter as a device to be used possibly sometime in the future. Have not tried it (thus 3 stars) yet but price was very reasonable and construction appears to be very good.
4,Fascinating!,"A long but extremely rewarding read! Meticulous research brings these two brilliant writers to life. A longtime fan of both of these writers, I had originally planned to buy this book at the time of publication. However,plans did not go accordingly, and when I finally did, I could not find a copy. It was until a recent book fair at the local mall that I was able to find a copy. I spent many nights glued to this book fascinated by this turbulent relationship.This is a biography I will read again and again. I had never read anything by Joan Mellen-She is a wonderful writer!"
1,"Insensitive and sometimes give false ""no current"" readings","Insensitive and gives false (""no current"") reading sometimes.I also don't like that I can't always tell that it's on or off.I would not recommend the Sperry VD6505."
1,does not work any more,"i bought it couple months ago. just tried it again yesterday, it did not respond. it was totally dead. too bad, it's too late to return it now."
2,Voltage detector,"Gardner Bender #VD6505 Adjustable Voltage SensorThis voltage detector detects voltage good in open wire, but when you try to detect voltage in the wall... it beeps at everything or do not beeps :) sometimes it beeps too when there is no wire in the wall :(I try many position of Sensitivity regulator, but precision is not good :("
3,Worth buying for one scene.,"Backseat Driver, as the title indicates, is a compilation of video footage shot from the backseats of a variety of sports and racing cars. It also includes 'The Restoration Game' documentary that can be found on some of Brentwoods other titles.Like all the other Automotive Series titles released by Brentwood, this title possesses only mediocre video and audio quality. However in common with the rest of this series, it does include some interesting and rare footage.For me this title is worthwhile purchasing just for the ""back-seat"" footage of a Porsche 936 doing a lap of Le Mans - passing Porsche 911 Carreras at 212 mph down the Mulsanne - the power sliding out of corners - Awesome! I would class this footage second only to the Peugeot 405 climb of Pikes Peak featured in 'Climb Dance'."
2,Bored? This will put you to sleep.,"What has happened to Duke? There were 17 rounds in 2005. In a DVD advertised as 180 minutes, we get, in every round mind you, four separate plays of the cartoon characters with a synthesized ""Are you ready boots?"" Then each round has stock tourist footage of places like Bruno, Sachsenring and Assen (just in case you were planning a visit other than to see a GP). Then there's an on-board lap (apparently useful to some GP riders) but unlike past years, they don't even bother to inform who the rider is. So that's a full 119 minutes of filler. They cut all but 15 seconds from the post-race interviews. And they cut all 125 and 250 coverage, a feature of prior years. Finally, there's the racing. Some of the most exciting footage ever, reduced to soporific four-minute outtakes. Compare the same company's 2002 or 2001 offerings and it's clear someone at Duke is ripe for new challenges. Guys, it's quite simple. Show the races, comment on them."
3,not bad,"More than enough to finished the work it would be nice if the nails were little longer, well its all good."
3,received,"Received items on 29 Sept 2012, was able to borrow these from our IT shop for my usage last week when I needed to secure the cable. thanks"
4,great!,these arrived promtly and performed well. they were also price very reasonably. if youre looking to hang speaker wire discretely then these are for you
5,Cable Clips,"These cable clips are very easy to use,and hold very well.For the price,I have enough to use for myself and to share with others.Other stores offer similar clips in smaller amounts for more money."
3,The nail isn't long enough,These are OK but the nail is pretty short. It's very easy to rip these loose after they are secured. Other than that they work fine.
2,A lot of words - not much inspiration,"I was quite disappointed with this book. I hoped for more to look at and less to read in a garden design book. It is more of a text book than a book for inspiration. If you are ready to sit down and read the basics on garden design, then this is for you. If you are hoping for inspiration from looking at photos of beautiful gardens, then look elsewhere. There are only 8 photos - before and after photos of the author's own garden."
2,Not quick,It did not work. I could not get it to dissolve. Had to manually remove from capsule. It might work if given enough time.
5,"Sturdy, practical, large","This is a well made product with lots of uses. Large capacity for a singlehanded scooper. Quality steel, excellent padded rubber handle. Built to last. Our application is outdoor gardening scoop(light digging, compost, fertilizer and soil mixing. Thong added for hanging on a garden hook. Appears to hold up well in outdoor storage."
4,Bond Stainless Steel Scoop,Vrey nice large size scoop. I use it for potting large house plants. Very useful for use with the large bags of Micarle-Gro potting mix. This mix is light and fluffy so a large scoop makes the job faster.
4,Be truthful to yourself,"This coming-of-age novel about a gay bi-racialman Paul Carter learning to be true to himself. On his road to self discovery he not only falls in love but understand the measures off fighting for love. He learns how onniving people can be and still understand that there is nothing to fear but fear itself. Eventhough I was bored all the way up to chapter 8. It picked up, love has not everyone breaks even their are winners and there are losers. Sadly not everyone in this story is a winner however everyone walks away with a lesson learned."
3,Being True to Self,"SCRUB MATCH was filled with many depictions of everyday life: relationships, friendships, domestic violence and parenting. Although a gay/lesbian book, the storyline gave a clear view on similar incidents that occur within male/female relationships, reactions from parents when an individual decides to come out of the ""closet"" and the fear from within that everyone carries around sometime during their lives. It moved a little slow at times, but this did not detract from the messages the author was trying to convey. BILL EISELE captures self-truth at its most vulnerable state.Reviewed by Belindaof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
1,Could Be Happier,"The sound track is scratchy and of poor quality, very much unlike the products I have purchased through Amazon."
5,A Resplendent Masterpiece,"If I had to pick one of my many Christmas CD's as an all-time favorite, it would probably be this one. The works here span the 1600's and include such masters as Gabrieli, Purcell and Monteverdi. The choir is so pure and joyous, it really gives a sense of what Christmas is all about. It's also a beautiful representation of the early Baroque period. If you need a break from the more popular holiday music, this is a great choice, and you could probably enjoy it any time of year. Most people would never know it's a Christmas CD! It's good to see that it's still available."

5,"A ""Hearty"" Taste of Soul Food","Lamar Campbell and Spirit of Praise's ""From the Heart"" is a must-have for those who enjoy a balanced blend of genuine praise and earnest worship. If you hunger for an intimate experience with God, this medley of songs is food for the soul. With a delicate infusion of Contemporary Gospel and moving love ballads, this musical offering has something for everyone."
5,Off Tha Chain,"The new album from Lamar Campbell and Spirit of Praise is off the chain. From the first song to the last track, this album is a must have cd. I have truly been blessed from this album. i would highlyencourage everyone who loves praise and worship music to purchase this cd."
4,Contains One very interesting Bassoon Concerto,"I had part of these for years only on LP. This one has one of my favorites of the Bassoon COncertos, RV 483. Enjoy.There are no period instrument recordings of this."
5,Phenomenal,"There are so many great performances on this album, most notably Arsenio Rodriguez's four tracks, which steal the show. This is a phenomenal introduction to Cuban music--expect to be hooked."
2,expected something of a much higher class,"i bought this book , i thought it might teach me something about tennis , but it hardly did anything. it's not a very interesting book. it's boring and childish. if you are very small then it might help you."
2,"I don't know about everyone else, but.....","I don't know everyone else's experience with this paint, but here's my 2 cents. It took about three passes to get 50% coverage on my bike frame. I initially bought two cans thinking that would be enough. WRONG!!! With my project half finished, I've got to search the city for at least two more cans which AZ and N@p@ only carry one can of any one color.All in all, if you don't mind wasting paint, a high price point on a low durability product buy this paint. It's great for small projects, but nothing else."
1,doesn't work,"I hit the spray button, and after a few moments, the spray just stopped.The can was surely full and well-shaken.Some part of the spray valve seems to have broken during use... after only the first few moments."
5,I can't stop listening to this CD,"I love this CD. It is pure, driving, raw rock 'n roll. And the best part is, they are having fun doing it. Jen Rassler's voice is like Courtney Love and Joan Jett rolled into one. JJ's guitar, well, what can you say? Just listen to ""The Big Nowhere"" and you'll be sold. Great bass and drums, plus a little tambourine action on ""I'm Not Waiting"", and I'm in heaven! (""You can call me fast, call me easy, but baby you better just call me...I'm not waiting!"") The cover tune ""Radiates That Charm"" will have you charmed all day. Steal it, buy it, do whatever you have to do to get a copy. You'll be glad you did!"
4,Stedfast: Guardian Angel (Angelwalk saga no. 3),"I read this book in series order and absolutely loved it. Roger Elwoods presentation of the spirit of these angels is a wonderful eye opener.The concept of their struggle with what we humans do casts them in a totally different light. To become an observer with Steadfast watching Christ's walk through His life brings a whole new perspective on what He was like. The concept of Steadfast's ( and the other angels pain)creates a picture of angels being created in Gods image. Roger Elwood uses his imagination wonderfully but never stretches the truth of the Bible. I loved the entire series - it made me laugh,cry and rejoice all the while showing me a new insight into the mysterious world of Angels."
1,rip off,mechanism is very stiff and does not track well. I would not reccommend this to a serious model railroader
5,Still my favorite!,"This book is now more than 30 years old and it's still my very favorite sewing reference book. Whenever I can't remember how to do a certain handstitch, or how to cut properly on the bias, or put a zipper in perfectly, I drag out this book and find all the answers.Some of the information is dated, of course. It doesn't cover the newest fabrics or types of sewing machines. But the basics never change - and this books explains them all beautifully.I especially like the illustrations which show each step of the procedure. For the visual learner, these just can't be beat. The written explanations themselves are excellent, too.The book is well-organized and has a fantastic index so you can easily find what you're looking for.I know there's an updated version for sale at Amazon, so I am considering purchasing that edition for my daughter who is beginning to get interested in all things sewing."
5,Exactly what I needed...,"This review is for the 1976 edition.I haven't done any garment sewing since I was a kid in 4-H. I am working with a pattern which does not have any instructions and my memory has faded regarding how all the pattern pieces come together and in which order. This book helped immediately.I had several critical questions while working on my first blouse and this book answered every one of them. For example, I needed help with how to piece together the front facings, collar stand, collar and garment and the book provided clear examples. It has the choice several different types of facings, different collars, with and without collar stands. I also had questions about piecing together princess seams and the book goes through the process in detail.I like that the illustrations are clearly drawn instead of photographs. When it talks about types of fabrics it is a bit outdated, but that kind of information is available on the Internet.I am happy with my decision to buy with this book!"
3,Not bad ...,"but not great either. A couple of excellent songs mixed in with a lot of average ones. Boogie Man is a standout. Don't get me wrong, this is a good album, just not great. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could."
5,very good,This coffee has a nice bold flavor and aroma. I brew it as two 5 ounce cycles or occasionally the 7 ounce one. Recommended!
4,Dark Bold and Smoky,This is a really dark and bold cup of coffee. My favorite coffees are always in the French Roast and Italian Roast varieties and this Van Houtte coffee did not disappoint.
4,"Good, but beware of print quality","This remains a reliable dictionary, well-researched and helpful. The only problem I have with it compared to the much newer Oxf. Latin Dict. is that Lewis and Short suffers from an old-fashioned layout, which makes looking up words tedious. The other big problem is that Oxford no longer prints the books the old way, but photocopies an older copy. The print quality is terrible on many pages. It's hard to believe that they can charge this much. It's almost worth getting a 20-year-old used copy in good condition instead. This is a problem also with the Liddell and Scott Greek dictionary."
4,very good... not for the absolute scholar or the beginner,"While an excellent dictionary for undergraduate college use, beginners might find the Chambers-Murray dictionary more affordable and not noticeably diminished. For the serious translator and scholar, the Oxford Dictionary might be a better choice, particularly for obscure and/or late words. That said, Lewis and Short is my dictionary of choice."
3,Not Bad; Better due to Brad (Thornton),"The plot is a little sketchy in this made-for-TV movie; there are some real gaps. The ""supernatural"" killer is fairly typical, although the blurriness and darkness that surround him is a nice touch. The acting is overdone a tad, especially by the actor who plays the sheriff. To be honest, the best part of the movie is Brad Thornton. The man's a pretty good actor, has a great sensitive face, and a great body. He's the best part of the movie, especially for those 10 or 15 seconds (twice) near the end of the film when he is shirtless. No, I obviously have no shame!V"
4,Return to great Kid Songs,"A nice set of songs that every child should be able to hear. They'll remember them and hum them to their children. The song ""Nuke It"" is used in my 6th grade science classroom when we study electromagnetic spectrum. Laura Powell"
3,It could be better by separating into parts of speech.,"I am more interested as a beginner in learning nouns, then verbs and other parts of speech. You have to pick through them to organize that way"
5,Makes revolution seem so&#65533;logical,"Puts me in mind of the advertisement that warns mothers not to tell their children the product is good for them - it's so nice-tasting they'll assume it's a treat. The author's fireside-chat style is so gently informative and assured, I found myself effortlessly following his historical sweep from the creation of the earth through to modern America - learning all kinds of tidbits along the way. Did you know that over half of all the agricultural produce in the world originates in plants cultivated by American Indians? He pulls you into the flow of society's development, drawing parallels between the revolutionary appearance of a backbone in fish, and social revolutions punctuating periods of quiet evolution in human society. Places the American war of independence and civil war firmly in this context, and leaves the reader quietly convinced that the logical next phase of history includes workers power. Will give you satisfying food for thought."
4,Religious,"Blu-ray for under $10, This is not low budget, but it is amateurish, so as not to ruin the movie, all I'll say is it has a religious aspect to it. I did not like the movie, but that dose not mean you won't, if your a religious person and can believe in strange possibilities, it is a good, safe to watch with children, story about 2012. No nudity of any kind, no sex, very limited violence, no gore, no foul language that I can remember."
3,they are good movies if you are into things like that,it shows the way different people belive what could happen to us in the coming years
1,Bible pontificating,"If you want a movie that is trying to preach the ""Word of God"", then enjoy. If you're a fan of Bill Maher, avoid both of these titles at all costs. Boxes and titles make them sound like action packed films similar to ""Deep Impact"". What you get is many many many speeches about God and the end of times. What is really annoying is the attempt to convert people by tricking them into buying one type of movie and then giving them this. They were both produced by ""Faith Films"". Now I know why the two pack was so cheap for blu ray. Because they are very boring. I actually have nothing against God or people who believe in God, but I do have something against people who try to ram their beliefs down your throat. I wouldn't watch these two movies again if you paid me (unless it was a lot). What a shame I had to give it any stars at all."
4,Eclectic,"Eclectic selection of tunes ranging from Acid Jazz, Nu Soul and bits of Bossa Nova. Sometimes a song will remind you of Sade, another piece becomes Thievery Corporation without the-latest-electronica-chill-out gimmick. Paradoxically, my favourite track is a cover of 'Enjoy The Silence' (yes, Depeche Mode!) which happens to be sexy and inspired.All in all it is a great soundtrack for love and conversation, not the latest sounds around but never dissapointing."
5,Jazzhole's Best Work To Date! (www.dustygroove.com),"Smooth, soulful, and very slinky -- the fourth album by Jazzhole, and their best to date! The hip New York group have really honed their sound nicely -- focusing on their rich talents as a collective, and showcasing the work of a variety of great lead vocalists. Despite the size of the group, the sound's remarkably unified -- and the album comes off like a solo set by an individual, so strong is the collective vision of the work. Loads of great numbers -- with keyboards dancing over gentle beats, and sweetly soulful lyrics providing the finish! Titles include ""Circle Of The Sun"", ""Love Philosophy"", ""A Little Dress For Mary"", ""Winter's Meeting"", and ""Superstar""."
5,JAZZ + SOUL = WONDERFUL,"Once in a while a cd will come along that grabs my attention. And this is one of those. At first listen, I was a bit surprised as I was expecting more of a jazz sound, (I suppose because of the name), whereas this cd is more soul. JAZZSOUL maybe and not JAZZHOLE. :-) But I have to say, that I LOVE this cd. It is smooth and mellow; upbeat and catchy; and the variety is pleasing. Male vocals, female vocals, and instrumentals. The African influence is also here along with the smooth jazzy/soul. Anyway....enough of the categorization...it really doesn't matter what category this cd fits into. The fact remains that this is a wonderful album with great songs, and I, for one will enjoy it for many years to come. It gets an A+ from me."
1,Buyer beware,"In agreement with:: rsutton7He speaks the truth, I bought this junk also they were anywhere from 5- 8"" long did not last longer than the first big wind and 50% are dun!!"
4,old house,"came on time, packaging was damaged but the product inside was good, they worked great holding the tarp in place and they didn't come down in the 70 mph winds we just had."
4,Ball/Tulip 9 inch Bungee,My initial observation is the these bungees are a quality product. The true test will be to see how long they last in the elements. I have only used them once for a shade structure and they worked fine.
1,No Bungee to the Bungee cords,"I purchased these bungee cords when I purchased a new tarp (10' X 20' used as a canopy) a couple of months ago. Heavy duty my a__! I purchased the 100 piece pack and what a disappointment. All of the ones I have used, approximately 35 so far, have lost their elasticity except for 3. I had to take the tarp down due to Hurricane Irene coming through the state of NJ. The original bungee cords lasted over 6 years before they started to stretch out. This product is a waste of good money."
5,The best bungees!,"Oh man these little dudes are awesome.See, they have this cool loop of bungee cord that is attached to a hard plastic ball thing, exactly as advertised!I used em to attach tarps to some weird PVC structure that was being to use to protect my tent. Sounds crazy right?!Anyhow, these little things are great and probably have more uses than I care to think of!Bungee Balls Forever!"
1,Won't Stay Calibrated or Centered,"Ever since the pad was new, it has performed poorly. The left analog joystick is often out of calibration, no matter what steps have been taken to correct it. Disappointing performance is an understatement. Total frustration is more like it. It might behave for an hour or so, then won't do anything but pull left. I have never gotten the force feedback vibration to work correctly with games, either. It's either turned off, or running continuously. The software included with the controller was very minimal and of no great help in any situation.I trully wish I could get my money back. It's probably going to the electronics recycling center with my next batch of junk. The ONLY reason I bought this in the first place was that Microshaft has never issued a compatible Windows XP driver for their Sidewinder Pro, which never gave me any trouble."
2,"""I can't believe it! You still have the wrong picture for the product.!","The only reason I went on Amazon was so find a special Disney Classics box set formy 22 year old, severely autistic son. I was so excited to see the picture in your ad. This is a very rare box set and I knew my son would be so excited.Boy, we're we disappointed. The videos that came were 4 (not six, as in your picture) Disney CARTOON Classics (not Disney Classics, as shown in your picture).It's the difference between ""Chip and Dale"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"".I called customer support. She could see the problem and said it would be changed. I decided to keep the videos we had. the problem was NOT with the seller, but with Amazon. Your picture does not matchyour description. Please change it. It is very misleading.Sincerely,Jan Lougee"
2,Horrifying Home Movies,"Home movies filmed between 1948 and 1964, it is in grainy B&W. Opening images depicts a Hungarian couple, recording one another. It is Europe just post-World War II. There are still buildings lying in ruins. Then it goes on to the couple: he films her and she then films him. Then eventually goes onto their offspring. And some scenes we would deem not appropriate for film. The film veers between the vintage home movies and the video commentary by expert witnesses. Some witness read perhaps too much into what is happening, and only one of them shows any common sense. The movie is underscored with haunting music during the B/W portions. The filmmaker did go to far, in breaking into the ladies home to film the last reel. While this film is disturbing to watch, it is recommended."
1,Wow amazing how filmcrew can lead characters,"I'm hungarian and I understand the hungarian words in the movie. They were a terrible translations. The movie crew lead characters. It's amazing that this movie would ever be published / and shown on tv. I would have expected a much more from a ""documentary"". Facts instead of made up stories."
2,Awful taste,I bought this product based on a previous purchase of a similar product. This product tastes AWFUL and is not the least pleasant to digest. I am very disappointed in the taste. Using it as a digestive aid is almost worse than needing it as a digestive aid. The packaging and concept are nice but this product is awful. Possibly to use it topically is the only way to go (such as that posted already). Hope this helps.
3,"Nasty, but it works","After years of unexplained stomach aches, I've decided to try bitters. I know they're called Bitters for a reason, but, well, let's just say the flavor makes you want to deal with the belly ache instead. Even tried it with apple juice. I rather just not eat at all. Fortunately, Wise Woman has a digestive extract that is not AS terrible That's been doing the trick, only thing is I have to heat the water to help evaporate some of the alcohol.This particular brand of Swedish Bitters has no alcohol, but it tastes as if it does and then some. Not finishing the bottle."
2,2.5 STARS ONLY FOR invaders frm mrs ONLY.,"inv. frm mrs-best, the other 2 bite. flt 2 mrs-borin-no action or monsters at all. mrs attacks-needs waymore monsta action plus it was just way tooooooo dumb to watch. inv frm mrs gets only alone not really 2 but 3 stars but the other shows spoil it alltogether by their complete odds together mathematically."
5,Visionary documents that changed the world,"The two documents enclosed in this book, the ""Declaration of Independence"" and the ""US Constitution"" continue to spread international influence. Most democracies established since the US have used the US Constitution as their model.Hopefully I don't have to summarize this book for you to know what the two documents are about.These two documents should be read by every American. Even non-Americans might find the Declaration of Independence an interesting assertion of human rights.Of course the constitution is flawed (ex: electoral college, 2nd amendment's laxness, etc) but no government is perfect, and there are much worse alternatives.Other relevant material to read would be ""Leviathan"" by Thomas Hobbes (for a diametrically opposite opinion) or ""The Second Treatise of Government"" by John Locke (to see where the Founding Fathers drew their inspiration from) and ""Common Sense"" by Thomas Paine."
5,Minette who? Julia Wallis Martin is incomparable. . .,"What a neat book. I was browsing through Amazon's "". . .customer's also bought. . ."" portion of the book reviews and found this book. I couldn't put it down and in fact read it in one marathon sitting on a long flight. Julia Wallis Martin has managed to write a dark and compelling mystery with an ending (and I usually guess who did it) that was in hindsight sort of obvious but so well masked in ambiguity that I wasn't really sure. Now that's a mystery! On top of that I realized that none of the characters were at all likeable, (except for maybe the intrepid Detective Driver) yet I really could not stop reading or caring about the outcome. I highly recommend this book---and am looking forward to reading her next book asap."
4,The next Ruth Rendell?,"Darkly atmospheric, with intriguing characters and a particularly repulsive murderer, ""A Likeness In Stone"" is reminiscent of such Ruth Rendell masterpieces as ""The Lake of Darkness"" and ""A Judgement in Stone."" In my opinion, comparisons to Minette Walters do Julia Wallis Martin a disservice because Ms Walters will never be able to create the kind of creeping horror that Martin makes the reader feel in this novel. The identity of the murderer is not hard to guess, but whodunit is less important than why, how (and how often!)."
5,Durable and versitle,I bought this for one of my students and it has served them well so far on their 1/8 and their 1/4 size violin. Durable and adjustable for all different shapes and sizes of violins and students.
4,EXELLENT DESIGN,"I OWN THIS SHOES FOR 3 WEEKS AND THEY ARE VERY COMFY.I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S A REAL LEATHER OR NOT THAT THEY USE , YOU CANT SEE ANY EDGE TO THE LEATHER TO TELL.ME FEET ARE A LITTLE WIDE AND STILL FILL GOOD."
2,MARIA MARIA?,"I would have to say that this is the most poorly picked soprano album I've seen. Where is Maria Callas? I'm not a huge fan but she was still amazing. If you're going to pic the number one sopranos, I think you should pick the number one sopranos. What about Diana Damrau?"
2,Endangered species,"Cute penguin and my dog loved it. Would have been even cuter if it had lasted more than 1 hour before its limbs were torn from its body and its stuffing strewn across the floor. I watched my dog play with it...she did what she was supposed to do. She chewed it and tugged at it and generally, well...played with it. It's hard to believe that this toy is intended for dogs. I mean, kids will pull on it, hug it and eventually put it on a shelf or in a toy chest. Apparently, that's what the manufacturers expected my dog to do. So now, our little penguin is gone, having been in our home less than the time it takes to say ""Where did my money go?"" I highly recommend this for owners of toothless, nearly comatose dogs. It's understandable, I guess, since the toy was probably made in some country where dogs, themselves, are eaten."
5,wonderful,"This plug is really comfortable and soft, it is easy to put in and you can barely see it from a distance."
3,"Does well, no backing.","These plugs are okay. Be warned there is no backing to them, as in, they are flesh tunnels with one end closed off. So, from behind you will still have a hole in your ear. They are very comfortable and the color is okay."
2,on its way to the junk pile,"This worked well for several months. It was easy enough to assemble and set up with each use. Unfortunately, it is not sturdy. One week it was standing next to the closet and when several items of (dry) clothes got piled on top of it, two of the rods broke. I have managed to use packing tape to hold them together for the time being, but it bends even more than it used to under the weight of wet clothes. If you do not put too much weight on this it works fine. The slender design was unobtrusive for clothes which need a few days to dry (e.g., a few sweaters). A wider design would be better for drying more clothes. In any case, a sturdier grade or thickness of plastic is needed. I chose this plastic one because it wouldn't stain clothes like some wooden and metal ones do after aging, but it was not a better choice."
2,Too weak,"Though I satisfied with shipping speed,it's too weak to hold any heavy clothes.Like the picture above,it's good for just a few towels.And it's not that big.Anyway it would be good for temporary use."
4,"Easy to assemble, but doesn't stay together well","If you ever have to take it apart in order to move, when you reassemble it, the bars don't fit as well anymore. It is easy to assemble, however, and easy to store."
2,Damage and missing components,"I received this product today. Firstly, I'm really impressed of how easy it can assemble. Once, I almost finished, I found that one of white rack is MISSING. And, the red rack is dirty. Some of racks are weak and easy to fail down (they are not fit with handling rubber). Moreover, one of the rack cap (on the hanging rack) is MISSING. I have no idea why the seller didn't check the product quality before selling to customer. I guess I got the USED PRODUCT with the NEW PRODUCT PRICE. Too bad! Don't buy it as well."
2,mine broke,"Hell, I have a problem with one of the items I bought.I didn't think the dryer would be so fragil or hard to put together. I bought two, one was for a gift. She was able to get her's together. I didn't. I bought them before christmas, I didn't open mine until last week. When I tried to put it together one of the points broke inside the hole. I can not get the piece out, so I can't try to fix it with super gluue or duck tape.I need some kind of help. I am in a wheelchair, so that limits me in what I can do or not do.Thank youS A Johnson"
4,what i expected,"easy to assemble, i like the plastic racks because they're easier to keep clean & germ free. wood will absorb germs! I can hang a regular load of laundry on it, place next to heat source and they're dry in a couple hours, & it makes my home smell nice! :)"
1,What a JOKE!,"This manufacturer should definitely take this piece of junk back to the drawing board! The rack, once assembled, will not hold anything with any weight to it at all. It is flimsy, cheap, and poorly designed. After I put it together, I ended up folding it down and depositing it in the trash, where it belongs!"
1,LOOK BEFORE YOU WEEP,"DID NOT KNOW IT WAS UNASSEMBLED NO MENTION IN ADTHE HINGE ARMS ON TOP WERE ON THE OUTSIDE INSTEAD OF INSIDE, HAD TO REDO ARMS (SCREWDRIVER & PLIERS)RESULTED IN A BUSTED ROD. I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS. BUYER BEWARE. NEXT TIME GO TO TARGET"
4,Good value,"At $19.99, it's the right price for a flimsy product. It can't actually hold towels the way the picture indicates (you can only drape heavy articles like towels or jeans over the top of the rack length-wise). You also have to be careful how you move the rack when it's open -- otherwise it may come apart.All that said, I'm buying another one. It's perfect for drying t-shirts and underwear. I usually drape wet t-shirts over two rods (like a center rod and an outer rod on a diagonal), both to avoid putting too much weight on one rod and to give the shirts more space to dry."
3,Kind of cheap,"I wasn't sure what to expect. It is cheap and flimsy. If you were to be gentle and only put delicates on there, it would be fine."
4,A very enjoyable read,Grace Edwards takes readers through the streets of Harlem while solving the mystery of whodunit. The story flows very well and her descriptions of Harlem makes the reader feel they are a part of the streets. There were so many people capable of the murder that it took me to the end of the book to figure it out.
3,"Interesting premise, but predictable.","I read the synopsis on the back cover and decided to give it a try. I could see that it was going to be a good premise, but it took one scene to disappoint me. Not to give anything away but Mali learns about a murder from dialogue that was simply unbelievable. Even though one of the two people speaking was supposed to be drunk, there was just too much information given at that time, especially since the characters already knew what had been done. It was a disappointing setup to begin the end of the mystery. I may read the first Mali mystery in the future, but not at this time. Great group of characters and Harlem history included, though."
4,Clandestino,just found out about this artist on the internet and decided to buy CD. First time around it was different but the music grows on you right away. I love the mixture of spanish and french. Can't wait to get his newest CD. ... Glad I purchased it when i did and I will treasure it!
3,In Harm's Way (#7),"I have read all of the previous Navy Seals books by Riker. This one was not nearly as ""gripping"" as the others. It seemed to take too long to develope. Not bad to read, but it was too easy to put the book down as I read the story."
3,weakest of the three volumes,"This volume of the SCTV show features very little I'd class as ""classic"" comedy (the other volumes must have the 3CP1, etc., great stuff on them).Basically, the only classic bits on here are Shake 'n' Bake, Prickley Heat, Mr. Boom Microphone, Pavarotti's Pet Peeves and some Doug and Bob bits. Too much Pre-Teen World, Days of The Week and other less than stellar sketches.The best thing are the extras. There is a John Candy photo gallery as well as a 6 min.+ interview with the man himself at his Ontario countryside retreat. We meet his wife and kids and also get to see good old John smoking on camera. It offers real insight into the comedic genius. The ""Producers"" extra is 29 min. long and is not really anything the average fan is going to rave about.Given the episode choices here, I'd swing for Volumes 1 or 2 over 3."
5,my 2 cents,"I think this album is a step above the last one, Seize The Moment. It shows growth, versatility, and strong vocals. I enjoy listning to this album, I dont have to fastforward to the next. Don't sleep on this album, lIke the song says ...""First Ya Slep"" Best tracks I like, Anything(hot), What's goin on (""), Checkin for me (oout of control)."
1,train wreck...,"If the publisher is going to ""translate"" the work then perhaps it should have been published as a Beverly Potter book and not under Lilly's name.Hopefully another publisher will come along and rerelease all Lilly's works UNTOUCHED & UNTRANSLATED as they were meant to be read.If you new (or familiar) to Lilly, I suggest picking up the recently republished book ""The Deep Self"". Thank you to Gateways Books & Tapes (EJ GOLD's publishing house) for bringing back the book...If I could give this book a ZERO star rating I would. Same goes with this publisher...To the individual who own the rights to Lilly's work - get someone to re-release the originals untouched. We all mistakes, so maybe this is the time to get it right."
1,baaaad,"With the hundreds of books I've read, I have never taken the time to write a review. After practicing Psychotherapy, as well as studying and teaching classes on the mind and emotions, for many years, I only have one thing to say about this book: IMHO, what it indicates, to me, about the mind of the writer is rather sad. Enough said..."
1,The most unnecessary game ever,"This game is exactly like the rock paper scissors that you play with your hands, except that you have to pay for it. It's a worthless product."
5,How fun,I got this as part of a white elephant party and it turned out it's a lot of fun. I would recommend.
3,"Rock, Paper, Scissors, oh My!","Well Jax has decided to make Rock, Paper, Scissors into a card game. Both players get dealt 5 cards, then play them one at a time, war-style. Of course, rock crushes scissors, paper covers rock, and scissors cut paper. The winner is the one who has the most cards when the deck is depleted.So all in all it's actually kind of fun to play, just to see if you can think what your opponent might play."
5,A great first Vonda CD,"If you aren't sure which CD of Vonda's to first pick up, try It's Good Eve. It's a collection of slower songs that really shows how talented she is. Her individual follow up, By 7:30 is a great one too- less acoustical and much faster, probably more mainstream, but this CD is my favorite and the one I listen to the most."
3,Disappointed by the music.,Does not meet the melodious quality and style of the cuts from the Ally McBeal CD.
1,Disappointed by the sameness of each cut.,"I have enjoyed Shepard's music on Ally McBeal. There it is placed strategically to accent either the character's plight or personality. I found this album disappointing in that the cuts each had similar tempos, leadins, etc. In a word I found it 'boring' after the first few cuts."
5,Thanks to the miracle of television...,"The Ally McBeal television series has brought Vonda Shepard the audience and recognition she has long deserved. But It's Good, Eve far outshines the Songs from Ally McBeal soundtrack. Vonda's incredible voice and well arranged songs make this a highly enjoyable album. Track 8, Every Now & Then, is truly captivating.You do not have to be a fan of the television series to reconize the talent of this performer and to appreciate the beauty of her voice and songs on this album."
4,Go Vonda!!,"I have loved Vonda's voice ever since I heard her on that Dan Hill song, ""Can't We Try?"" This album grows on you, like most of her work--before you know it, you can't take it out of the CD player! If you don't get a tear in your eye or a lump in your throat when you hear, ""Every Now and Then"", there's something dreadfully wrong with you! I can't wait to hear more from Miss Vonda!!!"
3,"Nice cover, shame about the I Honestly Love You","Interesting Olivia comp. Not often said, that! Of course it's main selling point is her 1984 duet with Barry Gibb, Face To Face. The song featured on Barry's long deleted solo album, Now Voyager, which, incidentally, is well overdue for a re-release.Other tracks here include 2 duets with Andy Gibb and one with John Travolta, Take A Chance, from their hideous mega-bomb Two Of A Kind movie. After that the collection becomes less involving with Sam, Have You Never Been Mellow and the song that just won't die, I Honestly Love You trawled out for the umpteenth time. Nice to see a couple of tracks from her under-rated 1998 Back With A Heart album included, though."
2,"close, but no cigar","M. Gira has not even come close to being a complete thought since those early years. Every release, on the surface seems interesting, but they all ultimately are missing something vital, something that gives them a life. Its very hard to describe. It always seems as though I am listening to a demo or a work in progress. This latest project ""Angels"" seem to take itself so seriously in all the strangest ways, it is almost a bit insulting to be honest. I have heard all of these melodies before, but now I am supposed to take them more seriously because M. Gira has decided to sing over them. If you like ""Angels"" it just seems like there are other bands/people doing this whole mood/sound better and with more honesty. To see people comparing Gira to Tom Waits or Cohen is a bit disturbing to me, because I just don't think Gira's music brings the same class of writing and depth. Anyway, If your a fan, your a fan, and probably not to interested in hearing this."
2,Video quality really poor,"I was amazed to see such poor video quality, then content also is not breath taking.I would not buy it if I knew the level of this production."
5,Great Mentor Text,"Salt Hands is a beautiful story. It reflects a special point of view that is unusual for most books. It is also great book for a teacher to use as a mentor text for writing. Unfortunately, it is a very difficult book to find for purchase."
5,A wonderful bed-time book,"This was one of our favorite bed-time reads. It's so easy to read this out-loud in a magical, calming, quiet voice and really set the tone. One of the girls' favorites from age 3 up."
1,MALOS !,"NACOS,MALOS MUSICOS,DE LO PEOR EN LA MÙSICA LATINA,VOCES HORRIBLES,NO GASTES TU DINERO EN ESTO."
4,"It was rushed, and you can feel it--a bit.","This is probably Fitzhugh's weakest book, but as someone else pointed out: his weakest is better than most author's best. The book is typically madcap and funny, but you can feel the rush job a bit. He would have benefited from tighter editing, and though the book moves as a great pace (I read it in a day and a half) I felt like some of this could have been left out (this is the first time for me where Fitzhugh has given us setups that didn't pay off). It's still an occasionally hilarious book--the satire is at times dead-on, and other times too forced--and I'd recommend it to anyone with a skewed sense of humor."
5,Well done,"A beautiful, finely woven tapestry, this journal moves wonderfully from beginning to end. If you are an on-line reader of InkPot do not miss it in print."
4,Good honest retro fun.,"If you like breakout or brick breaker or any of the other clone games, and have a super nintendo you will certainly like this. There are a lot of levels and some interesting boss fights. The game doesn't have any music really but it does have sound effects of the ball bouncing off blocks and walls. It has all the classic upgrades to the paddle. Laser, catch, extender, multiball ect. It is nothing new but it gets the job done correctly and will be an entertaining game if you are into really retro style games."
1,For language students only,"If you are a linguistics major this is perhaps a nice reference work. If you are looking for an introduction to Indo-European languages for the non-specialist(as I was), you will probably be as disappointed in this book as I am. It is replete with insider jargon, nitnoids for the linguistics student cramming for the finals. It is for study, not for reading."
3,Okay,"This was an ok CD. Most had a nice, dancey beat and were rather techno-pop than rap. It would be great club music, and music to preform to rather than something you'd want to listen to all day. As for the Feminem remark? We'll have to see..."
4,Tight,"She's got a pretty tight flow to her lyrics. Sarai really can make you want to dance, because her songs are so upbeat. As for calling her Feminem, I don't agree. She's awesome and all, but Eminem's style is WAY different. Maybe after her 2nd album (hey, even though there's no first, she has the potential to make a second!) she might sound more soulful and her lyrics might mature a bit. But she is pretty cool, especially for the fact that I didn't even know she was white when my friend played her song for me. Sarai has the ... er ... I dunno what it's called ... potential, maybe, to push hip hop as far in the opposite direction as it will go.Keep the raps tight,Battle but don't fight,CIAO.-Katster"
1,THIS STYLE AND FLOW IS ALREADY OUT THERE,"THE BEAT TO PACK YOUR BAGS HAS AN ARABIC VIBE TO IT THAT DOES NOT GIVE THE LISTENER A GOOD FEELING. AS FOR THE LYRICS THEY REPRESENT WHAT MISSY ELLIOT AND OTHER FEMALE RAP ARTISTS ALREADY HAVE ESTABLISHED. AS FAR AS FEMINEM, THIS IS DEFINATELY NOT THE CASE. EMINEM HAS HIS OWN STYLE AND HE IS IN A RAP GENRE ALL BY HIMSELF. IF YOU WANT TO BE THE FEMINEM YOU HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF DOWN AND GET RID OF THE ARAB TRACK."
4,"good fit, plastic is not the best clarity","This fit perfectly, and do their job well. The only complaint I have is the quality of the plastic. They have small bubbles in them and one is slighly warped."
1,I've read a story like this before...,"this story really borrows too much from the Alien movies. Humans infected with the DNA of alien life forms, and theyare doomed from the moment that they become infected. The X-Men should have just destroyed them and that would be the end of it. Instead we are treated toanother X-Men story which is just as bad as the Onslaught saga, if not worse then it."
4,This disc is a perfect tonic,"This album is fantastic in the right setting. It taps the soul of broken-heartedness that most people regret having experienced at some point, yet it does more that pound the 'lost love' idea found in most musical heartbreak. They hit on somewhat unexplored aspects of relationship failures, the slowly building resentment of being 'stuck' in a relationship and the resigned self-recrimination after a good love goes bad amongst others. It's not all sorrow and heartache, and it balances in a very comfortable, country-esque way. Hurry up and grab it before it's out of reach, as I haven't been able to find the band or the record label's websites anymore."
1,Gross!,"I got this to help with balancing my digestive system after being sick. I don't know if it's just me, but all it does is make me really sick."
5,"Does what it says it does, very reasonable price.","I use it to keep the salt and water balance in our swimming pool. The buttons aren't completely intuitive, but it isn't hard to use once you learn how."
3,Needs different display cover material.,"Seller was great, no issues.Product: purchased (2) about same time. One going on 6 months and still working. Other one lasted about 5 months and will no longer calibrate and randomly jumps around on readings without testing anything. When it's working I do like it, quick & easy. Material wise the protective cover over the ON/OFF button has broken from repeated use on both of them (the flexing of pushing the button cracks the plastic). Not surprising, I guessed it would sooner or later when it first arrived & saw it but it seemed minor for the cost. They are being used in a production environment and turned on about twice a day & auto off (2times/day * 5day/week * 4weeks/month * 5 months = @ 200 cycles). Not a great plastic cover life. A silicone (more flexible) button area that won’t break as quick would be more useful."
2,Lack of detail and practical utility - outdone by O'Reilly,The book lacks details and does not include a lot of practical examples. Much of the book is filled with countless pages of library source code that has very little use to the end user or adminstrator and should have been left out of the book and put on a CD. The August 1999 O'Reilly book (MSQL and MySQL) puts this book to shame.
3,"Okay for a first issue, but needs to be rwritten immediately","Since this is the first book on mSQL, I can't complain too much. However, less than 1/5 of the book is on mSQL & W3-mSQL. There should be a LOT more!!There is a lot of information in the FAQ that should have been in the book. Also, a lot has been assumed. For instance; no where does the book explain the # sign and how it is used. PrintF and the use of the % sign should be explain. Not everyone is a C programmer!Everyone should read the FAQ as well as this book. Hopefully the authors will start immediately on a new version. Still, an excellent book for as far as it goes."
3,Good.,"Good, but it could have had a chapter relating to integrating it with Apache or another web server. Also some Lite examples could be included on the CD."
4,Creative toy for the little ones,"This is a clever toy for toddlers and preschoolers. It involves fine motor coordination (i.e., peeling off the cut outs, crumping up the tissue, sticking the little tissue balls on the adhesive cut-outs) and creativity. It's the type of art that is structured (the cut outs are already made) yet gives them freedom to choose color and pattern. The end product tends to be beautiful. I got one for my daughter and have already given a few as gifts. It does require some grown up support, though, otherwise impulsive little hands will just peel off all the cut-outs and tear out the tissue pads."
4,Excellent Craft for Toddlers & Very Portable for Travel,"I bought this for my 2.5yr old daughter. She loved it. She was able to do it by herself without help from me...unlike some of the other Alex kits where I need to help her with the glue stick and punch out the decor. The materials required are very small and compact making it great for travel. We have taken in on a few vacations. As mentioned in some other reviews, the ""sticky"" part of the craft could be more sticky, but we still made it work. And we did get a little colour on our hands from some of the tissue paper, but it was very minor. Overall, I would say this is a great craft at a great price."
4,Good for young children.,Bought this for my 4 year old grandson who enjoys craft type projects. You have to peel off the top paper on the pictures to uncover the sticky sections. Since these sections are color coded it is really easy for young children to make these pictures. They just match the color on the picture to the color of paper. My grandson really enjoyed working on these multiple times. He sometimes decided he didn't want to follow the pre-colored areas and made his own designs which works also.
1,Fun but does not work,"The product does not work. Little squares do not really stay balled up, and the sticky sheets are not sticky. We had to buy a glue stick to be able to do anything with it. We primarily used colored paper to glue them on blank pieces of paper."
1,Not sticky,"I bought this for my 2 and a half year old because she loves arts and crafts. It's a great idea because there's little mess. But the problem is that the boards are not sticky even immediately after we peel off the tape. She would peel off the tape, put the tissue paper on, and it would just fall off. It was frustrating for her. I know we can use glue but it defeats the whole purpose, especially because this product is geared for 2+. It would be great if it actually worked. I wouldn't buy this product again."
4,Great project for small hands,"Product comes with different colored tissues already cut and sorted so that is a big plus. A lot of crumbling up paper. My 3 year old got bored pretty quick but the projects do turn out really nice if you are willing to but the time in. I would say it is better for a slightly older child, 6 and up who have more of an attention span. Love the fact that you can peel off the backing section but section to reveal the adhesive."
2,Peanut Brittle is delicious but...,"The candy is delicious so the two star rating is deceiving, but the can contained nothing but crushed brittle. Little pieces were annoying and no big pieces were available to put in candy dishes for company. I should have sent it back."
3,"Good, but I wouldn't write home about it...........","This is fresh & good tasting, but not nearly nutty enough for my taste. Not at all like any peanut brittle I've ever had, with the brittle tasting more like peanuts or peanut butter & the crunch doesn't break your teeth like many brands. Also, this is thicker than any I've ever seen and in just the perfect sized pieces for snacking. It is still very good which is why I gave it 4 stars. I'd have given it 5 stars if only there were more peanuts."
4,too many crumbs,"too many crumbs in the bottom of the can and not enough large pieces to share, when we have enough to share!Gaye Ash"
2,If You Like,"peanut brittle that is pale, almost nut-free, really sugary, and over 1/4 inch thick - Then this is the brittle for you. However, if you like yours amber, popping with peanuts, mildly sugary, and thin - This is not for you. The canister came in good condition and the brittle was vacuum-sealed. The pieces were separate and fresh."
2,Product looked like a reject,"I purchased this item in October. It arrived in a can that had the label torn and re-taped with Scotch tape. The printing on the bottom said ""Best if Purchased by September 2009. The rim of the bottom of the can is rusty. I haven't had the nerve to open the can yet. It definitely appears to be a product reject that Amazon and Virginia Diner passed off on a customer many miles away from their company."
2,Peanut Brittle,I would not buy this item again. It tasted too sugarery and not peanutty enough; the candy part is too thick which probably accounts for the too sweet characteristic and that also makes it very hard to bite/break.
3,Plastic parts crack over time,"I've owned my Bunn NHBX-B for over 3 years. About 1 year ago, I noticed the area where the coffee basket slides in was starting to crack. It is completely cracked now, and this prevents the water diffuser from attaching. It served me well for quiet awhile, but I was used to Bunn quality products lasting for much longer. The plastic construction where the hot water comes out seems like poor design."
5,still the best coffe maker around,"We had one of those for over 10 years. When it finally croaked I did a lot of research on other coffee makers and not one of them had good enough reviews. After a while I thought, 'why mess with a good thing,' and bought the same one again."
5,The best!,"I have used a Bunn coffee maker for years. When it was time to replace the unit, I wasn't interested in looking for another brand because I had been extremely satisfied with the first product. I really appreciate having hot coffee a few minutes after I push the button -- and find that is good protection for those around me (rather than waiting a long time for the first cup of morning coffee!)."
2,Leaks water,"We purchased this item with the intent of 'finally' owning a 'quality' product.Bunn has been around for a long time and I grew up seeing their product in cafe's and restaurants. I was tired of buying throwaway coffee makers that leaked or died in a year. So, I concluded that even though the price was more you get what you pay for right? Wrong. The product did make it just under 2 years before leaking water like a sieve. Now I have the choice of trying to take it apart and find out why, or throwing the whole thing in the trash and buying a cheap, good for a year, throwaway brand.I am totally disgusted with the inability of a company like BUNN to produce a quality product. I may have got a lemon and their other products may be acceptable. That is the only reason I gave it a two instead of one star rating."
4,Pleased with my purchase,"I've owned mine for two years and it serves the best tasting cup of coffee I've ever had at home. The only negative would be water loss. Frequently, I'll pour 10 cups of water in the machine and it only makes 8-9 cups. I've learned to compensate for this, so it's not an issue any longer. I would recommend to anyone."
3,Good coffee but---,"I agree with other reviews, Bunn does give a delicious cup of coffee, the down side is the coffee potThere just is no way to pour coffee without spilling it all over the counter. I have tried a fast pour and a slow pour and stillGet a mess. Maybe the design guys could go back to the drawing board and come up with a better design, I would buyA replacement pot that does not leave a coffee mess around my cupSharon"
2,Pot very bad.,We like Bunns for the speed they make coffee in a hurry.Pot drips very bad.have tried everything to help this but now just pour over the sink. Other wise works fine.
2,Lid bad design,We have had bunn coffee makers for years the last two we had the plastic reservoir burn in half so we had to purchase two in the last 5 years. Warranty wears out just before it starts leaking underneath. The new pot lid is not designed to prevent pouring the coffee going out all over the place. My husband did not want to buy another bunn but I find the coffee tastes south better when brewed by a bunn
2,Not so hot,"After reading how the tank heats the water, I found that it still is not as hot as I expected. I thought it would be piping hot, so I prewarmed the coffee mug and cream but it only helps a little. A little bummed out. Actually, very bummed out."
5,Great coffee maker,"I wanted a coffee maker that is simple to use, reliable, and brews great coffee. The Bunn coffee maker meets all my expectations. I brew 4-6 cups daily and within minutes my coffee is ready to serve. I'm still experimenting with the grind and quanity when brewing."
4,Its Bunn Good,Fast and works great. Just remember to delime every two months. Must be carefull when moving under counter. Worth the cash.
4,Bunn is the best coffeemaker,This is my 4th Bunn coffeemaker in the last 20 years - had 3 BunnOMatics -still have 2 that work great. Needed this one while renting a vacation condo in Fl for the winter. Can't take the cheap Mr. Coffee style units. Bunn backs up quality products with great customer service and replacement parts if it ever becomes necessary.
5,This is the Coffee Pot,"great pot, good coffee, good look, this along with the Bunn Air Pot make a great set. This coffee pot is quick, and easy to maintain, great pot for someone who likes their coffee in morning, pour in water, brush your teeth, and presto a full, hot, good pot of coffee is awaiting you. what a way to start the day :>)"
2,Not what I expected,The coffeemaker was not what I expected. The taste of the coffee wasn't any better than what I had. I especially didn't like the fact that it had to be on at all times.
5,Pleased,"I am very pleased with my new Bunn coffeemaker. I'd been wanting one for a long time and when my other coffeemaker quit working, I decided now was the time to get a Bunn."
1,High Altitude Model Required over 4000 Feet!,"I bought this coffee maker on Amazon after seeing the number of positive reviews. One thing that's very important, and I only found out after getting it delivered, buy the high altitude model if you live over 4000 feet altitude. Denver is over 5000 feet, for example. The reason that it's important is your coffee that sits in the carafe will boil since water (coffee) boils at lower temperatures as you go up in altitude. Boiled coffee is bad coffee. Coffee makers by BUNN that work at high altitude are designated ""D"" in the model numbers."
2,Has a plastic smell,"The hot water that I ran through the system prior to actually making coffee emerged smelling like plastic. I'm sending it back. And I'm going back to using my French press, which is messier but clearly not as carcinogenic."
3,perfect coffee,"Makes great coffee, I do not leave the unit on to keep the water hot but turn it on about 15 minutes prior to putting decanter water in to brew coffee, saves on the energy.I would have rated this a 5 but Bunn websight boasts that their coffee makers are American made (box says Canada)I value purchasing American made products. Amazon service fantastic as always"
4,Fast coffee maker purchased through Amazon,We have gone through a ton of coffee pots. We finally purchased a Bunn. Good coffee maker. However I grind our beans and we use Decaf. so it takes a little more coffee to make it as strong as I like it. I called Bunn and they sent me (free of charge) a shower head for decaf. Great customer service. Good coffee maker.
4,3rd or 4th Bunn,"This is my third or fourth Bunn coffee maker, and while it is a little different than the others, it is still OK. I have noticed it makes a lot more noise when heating than any of the others, and I had a little trouble at first with it dripping quickly...it wanted to stall or be slow in dripping. But it seems like it is OK now after a couple weeks of use."
3,Dissappointed....,"I bought this pot in 2007-2008 ?? Can't remember exactly ..I thought I had left an earlier review but could not find it..When the coffee maker came the lid was sprung abit.....But ..I needed it ..It didn't seem to effect the coffee making so I was fairly happy...I didn't like the fact that I had to make a whole pot,but the coffee was good and I would pour it into a thermal carafe...It's 2010 and it has died.The water doesn't heat up enough to get even a passable cup of coffee...So, I guess I must buy a new coffee maker..I really don't know what the life span of a coffee maker is..but.. from Bunn I expected a few more years..Today I bought the Zojirushi EC-BD15.......Let hope it make good coffee and lasts a bit longer.....Fingers crossed.."
4,Excellent Coffee Maker,"This is the 3rd BUNN that I have owned. The other two eventually leaked and I'm sure this one will too in time. Still, it makes a fabulous cup of coffee in 3 or 4 minutes and I just can't go back to the old way. It takes too long! Each of my other models lasted about 5 or 6 years before they started leaking water all over my counter. The only criticism I have of this particular model is that it is really noisy when heating the water, much louder than my previous two were. However, it doesn't last long, only a few minutes, and I can only hear it in the kitchen. I drink my coffee in the den so it doesn't bother me. I also wish it wasn't made in China! If I had a choice of a similar coffeemaker that was made in the U.S.A., I would buy it. There's just nothing out there like a BUNN!"
5,A Work Horse Providing A Great Brew,We have used this coffeemaker for @ 5 years at my workplace. A 24/7 unit. It still makes good coffee and is still in good workingorder despite heavy use. I just bought one for myself at home after my second cuisinart in that 5 year period quit. Now I start mymorning with a quickly (3 Minutes) made 4 cup pot and it is hot and delicious. Should have bought one for home 5 years ago.
3,Not good quality construction,Had this same coffee maker before the new one. This one does not heat the coffee as well and the container lid does not fit well. Probably will not buy this model again.
1,Worst Bunn Coffeemaker,"We have owned several Bunn Coffeemakers and this one is terrible. When you go to pour coffee, the lid opens and coffee goes everywhere, every time."
5,Works as a Bunn should.,Have had Bunns since the 1970s. This bunn works as advertised and I've had no problems with it. I recommend Bunns to anyone.
3,Dripping Carafe Very Annoying,"Love taste and speed of coffee, but the drippy ill-fitting poor quality lid on carafe is a daily annoyance. I am very surprised and disappointed in BUNN product quality on this aspect of their home-use version of their commercial product. I would return it but shipping packaging was thrown out."
3,OK but coffee pot lid is defective!,The maker itself works well but the lid the glass pot came with was defective and everytime you poured it it would spill. Since we were replacing like product we just used the old one on the new pot. Comparing the two you could see where the defect was. I just hope we were one of the few but I'll bet the mold for the plastic lid was made wrong. I did not know how to tell Amazon about this thru the web site. Maybe now they will know.
5,Can't live without it,I'm on my third BUNN in 25 years and when I wear one out I find life is hard until I get a new one.
5,It works!,"Waking to a dead coffee maker on the weekend makes one appreciate a good cup of coffee. Doing a quick search on the net, we purchased the Bunn from Amazon. Restaurant runs were made until it arrived at the front door 2 days later.The Bunn does precisely what it was designed to do. This product brews coffee well and does it fast. Pour water in the top and preheated water from the reservoir showers the coffee. The unit keeps the coffee hot. There is no running back and forth to push a button. What about taste? No problem there. We are not coffee snobs. We used different brands until we found a couple that pleases us. The Bunn requires less coffee for our taste than suggested in the printed info. Four scoops works fine for ten cups.Would we buy it again? In a heartbeat!"
5,GREAT,I'm very satisfied with the purchase. The price was unbeatable and it arrived a couple of days sooner than was promised.
2,NOT HOT ENOUGH!!!,"I was so exited to try this coffee maker. Looks great and all but it's not much different than most all other drip makers in that it doesn't make the coffee all that hot. Another thing is that it doesn't brew at the temp it's supposed too, it brews more like at 185 degrees. So if you're like me and love your coffee piping hot, I wouldn't suggest this coffee maker."
1,I wanted to love this coffee machine so bad...,"I had been dreaming of owning a Bunn for most of my adult life. We finally got one last year and at first it was everything I dreamed it could be. It was super fast, simple and really cool. It felt cheaper than I thought a $100+ coffee maker should feel, but I could see passed that. About a month in it started leaking water. We have to clean the gigantic dirty puddle under it every two days. It gets everywhere. Also, the amount of water you pour in is nowhere close to how much coffee it makes. I have a feeling the two problems are connected. Anyway, we're about to go back to out trusty $20 Mr. Coffee.Totally let down."
1,Two huge flaws!,Well I had one like this for about four years and lived with it leaking after two.. It finally got to the point where it would leak half of a pot. After reviewing tons of coffee makers with each seeming to have their own flaws I bought another one of these. It is going back! The quality is going down hill and Bunn is probably not what the name used to mean anymore with China manufacturing.Forget pouring out of the decanter unless you do it over the sink or hold the lid open. You will spill as much as what goes into the cup! The second issue is even worse and can not be lived with. When you go to pour water into the top the rubber seat that is supposed to prevent the water from going into the back end until you close the lid is cheap and defective. Coffee starts to brew and come out of the thing before you even have the pot underneath! Forget this thing.
1,Bunn quality is no longer the same,"Like many other reviewers, I have had Bunn coffeemakers for years and love them. That quick pot of coffee had no match. When it was time to buy a new one, I just couldn't believe all the negative feedback and decided to take a chance. This was Bunn! Well, I wish I had listened to the reviews. When folks said the coffee started brewing and dripping immediately, I didn't realize they meant that it started before the lid was closed (in previous versions, closing the lid started the brewing process. With this model, if you don't pour the water and get the pot under the drip FAST, you have coffee dripping before the pot is in place. What a pain! And the new carafe is impossible to pour without spilling. It also seems the quality of the housing of the machine is much lower. I'm so disappointed to be saying goodbye to Bunn."
3,makes good coffee but....,Coffee maker makes good coffee but the carafe is flawed. One must pour very slowly to keep coffee from spilling as the lip is too shallow for normal pouring.
3,Coffee is delicious!,"However, If you are not going to make coffee everyday ( i only make a pot once or twice a week ) this is not the coffee maker for you. You will need to addwater to it before you make coffee or wait 20 minutes to heat water because youturned it off. I should have looking into this better."
5,Been using BUNN for over 20 years.,BUNN makes the best coffee maker - delicious hot coffee in no time and they last forever (almost). We used to go through a coffee maker a year until we spent the money for a BUNN. I would never change.
4,bunn coffee maker,recieved in good shape and in minamal time. I have had bun coffee makers for 25 years or more and they make the best coffee and are very fast. The reason I did not give it 5 stars I dont like the way the lid is on the pot. It catches moistue under it and drips when you pour your coffee. Other than that it is great.
5,Great Coffee Brewer,"One of the best coffee brewers I've ever had. Makes wonderful coffee. I requested the free ""flow restrictor sprayhead"" which prevents grounds from spilling over in the basket and also allows you to use less coffee. Since we only make coffee in the morning, and also to keep the water from heating off and on all day, we put our unit on a timer. This also takes care of a minor drawback for the unit which is that there's no automatic shut-off for the warmer plate."
3,Just okay for us,"I bought this Bunn NHBX-B as a mothers day gift for my wife to replace a Mr. C. which was leaking from the lid when we poured. Since Bunn is top rated I felt it would be worth the extra cost.Cons:*It fits on the counter under the cabinets but is difficult to pull out to pour the water into the top since it is holding 10 cups of water while being pulled out and 20 cups being pushed back in.*While pouring the water into the top it always seems to spill down the front and onto the counter.*While pouring coffee into a cup the decanter dribbles the coffee down the front when full (not so much when halfway).Pros:* It does make the coffee fast* It's a BunnI think it would be fine if a commercial easy pour decanter would fit, but it doesn't. A tip I learned is to press a finger on the top lid while pouring a full decanter of water or coffee and it doesn't dribble as much."
2,not so fast.,"this is my second Bunn coffee maker. I had the same model, or one they replaced this model with, before and it finally sprung a leak. This seems to be common with these models. The new decanter spells coffee every time I pour a cup or use the decanter to load the maker. I was glad that I had hung on to the old decanter or i would have sent this back. The only reason I gave 2 stars was it still makes coffee very fast. When this one springs a leak I'll be looking for a different brand."
2,Not so good,The carafe that is included with this coffee maker is terrible. The carafe will cause you to spill whatever is being poured from it unless you are extremely careful. The coffee maker will brew coffee quickly but other than that it is not worth the price. I would purchase another coffee maker if I had to do it all over again. I have owned this product for four months.
5,LOVE IT!,I love my coffee machine!!!!! It seriously only takes less than 2 mins to brew at the 4 cup line. Makes an amazing cup of coffee. can use junk coffee and it tastes great!
5,"So far, so good!",I have had this coffee maker for several months now and it brews quickly and always delivers a delicious cup of coffee regardless of what brand of coffee I use. I am now hoping for longevity from this machine as I have had no such luck with other brands.
5,bunn,A very efficient product with high quality and continued improvement in design and function. A great source of hot water for coffee or other hot beverages.
5,Wonderful Product,"This is our second Bunn. When the first one died we thought we could do with the regular run of the mill coffee maker. Wrong! The time it takes to brew and the difference in the quality of the coffee was too much. We purchased this one and are just as happy with this one as the first, except this one is sleeker and prettier."
3,Not quite what I hoped for.,"I purchased this coffee maker to replace a Melitta Fast-Brew MEF2B (cone filter) for use in our office. After a week of drinking coffee made with this Bunn machine, the consensus opinion was not good. To a person, the comments were that the coffee made using our old Melitta Fast-Brew was better. The Bunn-prepared coffee was just missing something and sort of bland.We tried increasing the coffee/water ratio, but that only resulted in the grounds overflowing the basket filter.The coffee would come out somewhat better by interrupting the brewing by opening the reservoir lid after just wetting the grounds, pausing until it stopped dripping, restarting by closing the lid; this was repeated two or three additional times during the brewing cycle.I would have just bought another Melitta Fast-Brew MEFB2 if they were still available. This was our fourth. They lasted a year or so with 8h/d use."
1,3 min to 1 hour - Don't buy this p[roduct,"BUNN NHBB Velocity Brew 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer, BlackWe had a Krupps for 15 years that worked well. We purchased this one 2 years ago (>$100) and now despite several cleanings, it drips to the point where it takes an hour to brew a pot. Very disappointed."
3,Good but cheap carafe,"In an age where a $4 coffee is accepted, this coffee maker brews professionally tasting coffee at home. Yes, it sucks energy but it makes a good cup of coffee at a much lower price than going to Starbucks. My complaint involves the plastic top on the carafe. It is flimsy and cheap-- worse than top on a Mr. Coffee carafe. When you pour a cup of coffee or fill the tank with water, beware. It overflows very quickly and spills liquid all over. You can compensate after a while but I think a Bunn should be a quality project throughout. The Bunn people chinced out on this component."
4,Bunn NHBX coffee brewer,The bunn works fine great 3 minute coffee. Had to have coffee pot replaced. It was defective (would always leak coffee when poured). And it is very loud when reheating water.
4,Makes Great Coffee,"Definitely enjoy how quickly the Bunn coffee brewers work, especially first thing in the morning when you really need that first cup fast! This is the second Bunn Coffee Maker we have purchased and both have been good quality."
4,"so far its ok, not great","From the positive reviews, I expected a great deal from this coffee pot. Its good, but lacks in keeping the coffee really hot. Warm coffee is not my cup of tea."
1,Only Bad One out of Eight,"This is about my 8th Bunn Coffee maker, and the only one that seemed to be defective. I loved this coffee maker so much, I have purchased them for several years for use @ home, office and vacation home. I wanted to have a 2nd one @ home for use of Regular and then DeCaf to support a large party we were hosting @ Easter. Unfortunately, my husband threw the box away so I couldn't return it directly to Amazon. However, I did call Bunn, explained the problem and they are offering replacement when I send the unit back w/a letter of explaination. It's truly the fastest brewer we've ever used. Normally, we enjoy it very much. This one however only produced about 8 cups of coffee when it should have had 10, was not hot enough and made a very loud noise when re-heating added water. It's obvious to me this particular unit was defective...but one out of 8 is not bad. I will continue to purchase the Bunn."
1,Not the old time Bunn,"We are not at all pleased with this Bunn. For starters the carafe does not pour without dripping. No matter how hard you try, it is almost impossible not to make a mess when pouring a cup of coffee. It does not heat the coffee to a very hot temperature and we were not aware when we bought this coffee maker that it does not have an automatic shut off. Save your money, you can get a much better coffee maker at a much lower price."
1,defective,"After two or three pots of coffee, the brewer dumped water all over the counter from a leak in the tank."
3,Lots of grounds... weak coffee.,"If you like relatively weak coffee then this is the coffee maker for you. It wasn't our ""cup of tea"": took a lot of grounds to make mild coffee (dunkin donuts or tim hortons). A timer to automate the process would have been nice but even then, the coffee wasn't strong enough for our personal taste. It's gone now."
5,Bunn NHBX-B Contemporary 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer,"Bought the BUNN because of its reputation and it definitely makes DELICIOUS hot coffee in under 3 minutes. I also love that the water doesn't start to drip until the cover is returned to the correct position. Prevents spilling and burns. However, it lacks a 2 hour automatic turn off timer, so you have to remember to shut it off.I bought this model because it was prettier than the original home model, but it still lacks design details. It may not be ""important"" in the coffee world, but those of us who enjoy good coffee, still want a pot that shows ""form that follows function!"" Now if they could only, make it look as beautiful as the wonderful coffee that it makes. If I were grading it like a term paper, I'd take off points for ""missed"" details. I'd give it an A-."
1,Very Fast=Very Weak,"This coffee maker takes much more coffee to make a pot than my old Mr Coffee. I contacted Bunn with my concerns and they sent me a new discharge nozzle. It did very little. So I am spending about 50% more on my coffee because of the ""fast brew"". Thats crazy.The fact that it constantly heats the water is not very energy smart.I am going back to a coffee maker that is half the price."
1,More Chinese Junk,Contacted Amazon before purchasing and asked where this item was made. Received a response that said they would have to research and get back to me.........never did. I then contacted Bunn customer service by email who stated it was assembled in the USA with components from here and abroad. I purchased and when received found a big MADE IN CHINA on the box. Never took it out and sent it back. Retailers and manufacturers keep forcing Chinese products down our throats when we have a 10% unemployment rate in the USA. Amazon and all retailers should list in plain view where their products are made so that consumers can make their own choices.
2,Quick cup of coffee,My cousin recommended this brand of coffee maker to us. We have had several different brands in the years past. Hopefully this one will last. It does makes a pot of coffee in 3 minutes. The one thing I do not like is the fact that it is always on. The water is kept hot in the system. When you want to move it to clean around it the silver part is actually hot to the touch. I do not like that. Also you need to purchase special filters for the grounds. We used the filters we already had and noticed that some grounds were mixed in with the coffee. That happens when you want to make the highest quantity of coffee. So it makes sense to purchase their filters because they sit higher in the funnel. We really wish it had a timer on it as well. We like to set the timer before we go to bed and then have the coffee ready when we wake up. I know its only 3 minutes but it was what we were used to before we had to replace our last one ..
5,BUNN COFFEE BREWER,I have had Bunn Coffee Makers exclusively for the past 15 years. There is none better and the price was icing on the cake.
5,Real Coffee,"BUNN NHBX-B Contemporary 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer, BlackThis is my second Bunn. You know how good the coffee is at the restaraunt, that's good coffee that's made with a Bunn."
5,bunny,"Love the new coffee pot! Looks great, brews fast and better that ""Mr.Coffee""Recomended to friends who also bought one!"
2,Hasn't lived up to expectations,"To explain my low rating, this coffee pot is definitely not optimized for brewed pots that are less than the entire 10-cups. If you put anything less than 4 scoops of coffee (8 tablespoons), you will end up with weak coffee. Yes, I do have the sprayhead and installed as well as the Bunn brand coffee filters where they are as tall as the plastic filter holder. However, the end result is that the back of the filter is always coffee stained and usually stuck to the plastic suggesting that somehow the water is probably flowing outside the filter.If I may conclude with sarcasm, this is an excellent coffee pot choice if you like to be able to easily see through the brewed coffee, and like to go through a huge container of coffee in one week."
4,"Fast, Hot, and Easy to Use","I've had this product for several months now. It certainly does make hot coffee, very quickly. It is sturdy and well made. As for drawbacks, I wish the burner plate had an auto-shutoff timer on it. I've left the decanter on the warmer all day by accident and come home to find burned up coffee in the bottom of the decanter. Also, I'm still having a hard time getting the coffee strength right. I tend to only make 4 cups at a time, which is the minimum amount recommended by the manufacturer. It seems to come out weak when you make small amounts. Also, it sometimes gets loud when the water heater section turns on. But, altogether, it's an attractive, well-made unit that is easy to use, fast, and makes good coffee (especially when you make a full pot). My parents and in-laws also have this unit, and we all agree it's one of the best coffee makers we've ever owned."
2,Very Disappointed,"I have now owned two of these coffee makers in the last 6-7 years. I was happy with my first one until it started to leak out of the bottom. I had it for about 5 1/2 years and I liked the speed of it and the coffee was pretty good. I decided to replace the leaky one when I was moving and I ordered the same model. I have had this one for less than a year and it is junk. It isn't keeping the water hot enough, so it brews weak and barely lukewarm coffee. I was extrememly dissapointed because I have had family members who had BUNN coffee makers for years and they would really last. It just don't think the BUNN name means what it used to. I have ordered a new machine and it is not a BUNN."
5,Excellent!!! Perfect!!!!,Love my new Bunn!!! I ask how did I live so long without it? I ordered with regular shipping and received it in two days no joke. Fast coffee when it's this fast you don't need all the bells and whistles. Each pot is always perfect.
5,My third Bunn coffeemaker,"I have not even opened it yet, because my second Bunn coffeemaker is still working fine after many years....My first one lasted many years also....I just wanted to be sure I had the third before the second got too tired to work....Best coffee ever!!!"
5,I love it,I used it for a couple weeks now for camping and so far its been great only improvement I could see is a better way to drain the water in the tank when its not going to be used for awhile
3,Bunn NHBX-B,"I was expecting a better brewed coffee, but was disappointed. Brewed coffee came out so quick once water is poured. Followed the instructions, for a cup of coffee with 3 scoops of good coffee, coffee turns out too light. I will not recommend it to anyone. I will rate it as one star, cann't go back & edit the rate i click.My Barista from Starbuck is much better, but only lasted for 5 years."
1,Ugh! I do not like this coffee maker!,"I am very disappointed in this coffee maker. Have had it now for 2 1/2 years. Must use a ton of grounds to get any flavor. Seems to clog a lot, had to remove small screw on button where the water comes through as it clogs so much. The worst thing is is that the side button to keep the water hot turns off easily. SHOULD be in a different location. I clean under the pot often as it seems to leak under the machine and it is SO easy to accidently turn the switch off when cleaning. No clicking noise, lights or anything to let you know the machine is off. TOOOOOOOO many mornings wake up and cannot make coffee as the machine, once clicked off from the side, has no hot water. Just a cold miserable mess to clean up. Can't wait to throw the whole mess in the garbage can"
1,Faulty Brew Maker,"Unfortunately, the new coffee maker leaks!!! Fortunately, the Bunn people are working with me to see if I can fix it and have sent me a couple of items to try. We'll see how it all works out."
3,New bunn coffee brewer,The brewer is slow to begin after adding water compared to the previous model I owned and the decanter drips coffee all over the counter when pouring(down the side instead of straight down). Would not purchase this product again. Pain in the..
3,Great coffee for a FULL pot - smaller amounts too weak,"I coveted this coffee maker for 2 years before finally biting the bullet to buy it. As anticipated, it made a delicious, hot full pot of coffee in 3 minutes. But 5 days a week, I need only the minimum amount - 4 cups. Despite getting the flow restrictor (which Bunn mailed for free very quickly), the only way I could get a strong enough small pot of coffee was to put in 8 heaping scoops - the same amount of coffee I use for a full pot. That made my weekday coffee twice as expensive, so I returned it and boughtCuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker, Black and Stainless SteelNow I push the 1-4 button on weekdays and get a terrific 4-cup pot as well."
1,bunn shame on you,I love bunn but I think because they usually last so long they changed something this is the 3nd one that i have gotten had to return the last one it did not heat correctly and this one now is not heating the carafe hot enough these are expensive coffee pots shame on you Bunn.
2,Used to be a good product,"Have used a Bunn machine for the last 20 years, but quality has really gone downhill.This is our 3rd machine. The skunky, plastic odor has been overwhelming (and I have a large open kitchen!). We thought it would subside with time, but after a month, it's still pretty bad.We're using a Capresso burr grinder to grind our own beans, and no matter what grind, we can't seem to get a decent cup of coffee with this Bunn model. Don't know if it's heating the water hot enough, or too hot.If we try to make a strong pot of coffee, the basket overflows. We are using the taller Bunn filters too.The machine is mostly plastic, and doesn't seem to be put together very well...kinda crooked, cheap.Previous machines have been better quality, and made great coffee. Don't know what's wrong with this one, but we're not happy with it."
5,They don't get any better than this!,Bought our first Bunn coffee brewer around 1980 and have never considered buying anything else! We just love it and you will too!!
2,Bunn NHBX-B,"The Bunn requires a finely ground coffee for a full-bodied cup of java. Otherwise, it will be weak. And I have read that you must brew a minimum of 4 cups on this Bunn. I brew a single cup frequently. The fact that you have to keep the appliance on at all times to heat the water is a bad design. The claim is that it starts brewing immediately since the water is always heated. However, it drips much longer than a conventional brewer. Very aggravating. And, of course, since it's no frills, it keeps dripping if you get a cup while it is still brewing. There is no reason or advantage to heating the water 24 hours a day except to burn power."
5,QUICK BREW COFFEE,"THIS IS MY SECOND BREWER. IT TOOK ME NEARLY 5 YEARS TO GO THROUGH MY FIRST ONE. I MAKE ABOUT 4 TO 5 BREWS OF 6 TO 8 CUPS EVERY DAY. THE BREWER IS GREAT. IT IS SO FAST. IF FREINDS COME OVER I HAVE A FRESH FULL POT OF COFFE IN ABOUT 3 MINUTES. MY FRIENDS ARE AMAZED. ALTHOUGH YOU CAN'T ""STEAL"" A CUP WHILE IT IS BREWING, AFTER ABOUT ONE MINUTE YOU CAN PUT A CUP WHERE THE POT GOES AND POUR FROM THE POT. WHEN WE GO OUT OF TOWN WE CAN TURN OFF THE HEATED RESEVOIR TO SAVE ENERGY. THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR THOSE OF US THAT DRINK A LOT OF COFFEE AND WANT IT NOW. IF YOU ARE A CASUAL COFFEE DRINKER IT MAY BE MORE OF A COFFEE MAKER THAN YOU NEED."
2,Not reliable enough for the money,"This was a gift from my coffee enthusiast mom. The machine proved to be very unreliable. While I am usually the only one drinking coffee, I am forced to a 4 cup minimum. Though, given the machine would typically brew less than 4 cups even with that, I suppose the minimum amount worked out. The ""fast"" brewing coffee due to the reservoir tanks ended up being, more often than not, a slow dripping coffee (rather than a steady stream), taking much longer than 3 minutes to completely brew. The swivel top on the water tank was not smooth and annoying to open. the lid to the carafe was flimsy and would open wide while pouring, leading to MANY leaks and messes. Overall, I am not thrilled and am returning for a different machine."
