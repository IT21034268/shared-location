2,Worthless tech support!!! Kept dropping connection!!!,"I'm experienced with networking, as I have 5 computers networked in my home. This product kept cutting out my internet connection every 18 minutes. So any java type application, etc. would stop and I would have to reconnect mirc, aol, realtick type apps. (...) I RETURNED THIS ITEM!"
1,Dead on Arrival,I bought one. I installed it and it didn't work. I called Netgear and waited on hold for 45 minutes. We discovered it was dead out of the box. Don't buy it.
2,"Good at Times, Bad At Others","This router is fast at times but is slow at others. You can download at full speeds at times but at other times, the download rate is horrible. We have 4 computers routed through the machine and even when only two people are online at the same time, you will notice a difference in the download rate if you were on alone. This is a good machine but is a little to much."
5,Literally Splits ur BAndwidth,"Let me first say that I haven't even taken this product out of the box. I'm writing this review to clear up some other conflicting reviews that stupid other users have written. First off this product odviously does not contain a manageable switch, duhhhhh! If it did it would cost about 2,000 dollars more. Because it's not a managable switch, you can't control how ur bandwidth is cut. Like if you had two computers and ur conn. speed was 4mbps downstream, then each one gets 2mbps. You can't set it up to have 1 computer with 500kbps and the other with 3.5mbps. Besides, only large offices need that kind of power. Even if you wanted a product with a managable switch for your conn., nobody makes one. Like others have said give all of your systems static IP adresses and host names, but keep DHCP ON! that way if a friend comes over to game, ur ready to go."
1,Tech Support? What a joke.,"Setup of the router was pretty simple. However, I could not get one of my computers to connect, and so I called tech support. What a joke. Tried several times to reach them. My total wait time was well over one hour. When I FINALLY reached someone, he basically didn't help me. The entire conversation lasted maybe five minutes, after which the line went dead. (Does this sound familiar?)I bought this product because I was under the impression that Netgear supported their products. It looks like I was wrong."
5,"Great product, I used it for years","I used this product for years and never had a single problem. It hooked up great, was immediate, and was strong and consistent. I'd still use it but now have vonage and am using one of their wireless routers (which does not come close to this router in quality). I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a wired router. Great job, Netgear!"
2,"Good for some, the rest of us...",The Netgear RT314 router works if all you want is to share an internet connection. If you wish to access the so called file/printer sharing and networking options then look for something else. The company dosen't even provide instructions for how to use the network if you can even figure out how to set it up. The best of all Netgear dosen't provide technical support for network related questions. Let's review company name: NETgear support provided: anything but NETworking. If you want to try and squeeze any information out of Netgear's horrible support people you might as well buy a book while your at ... because the average wait time is over an hour.
4,"Great product, once you get it up and running.","This is a great product but I somewhat disagree about the ease of setup. I myself have never networked anything in my life and I found it quite difficult to configure it properly, especially if you have PPPoE connection installed like myself. But once I called tech support(which was very helpful), I got everything up and running and it has been very stable since, no down time yet, plus it logs in for you automatically so you can get rid of Enternet or any other PPPoE software you connect with! I recommend this product to anyone looking for a good router, but you should read up on networking before you try and install it."
4,"Works great, but check e-mail accessibility after install!","Netgear's router works as promised, saving you money by allowing you to share your cable/DSL account on your network via your host computer.... w/out having to shell out monthly fees for another IP address for each additional computer on your network. In my case, it'll pay for itself in just over a year. Initial network setup was routine. However, after installing it, I couldn't access e-mail thru my @home account. The somewhat sparse installation guide, CD resource, and online setup wizard weren't much help so I sent my problem to Netgear's tech support. It's been a week and I still haven't heard from them as to a resolution. Ironically, I found the solution on the Linksys web site in their cable router FAQ area! Now everything's working and I can access my cable account e-mail on all my computers."
2,Sigh,"At the moment of writing I have not finished the novel yet. My reason for writing a review now is not to discuss the book, but to warn potential buyers about the e-book. The Kindle version is littered with mistakes. It would seem that whoever scanned and uploaded the novel obviously has not checked it for word/letter-recognition errors.Granted, it is a free book, but come on.Perhaps I should include my resume with this review. I'll be glad to clean up this mess if the publisher can't do it."
5,the symhonic rock is not dead,"Unlike most modern progressive rock bands bands, While Willow IS progressive. Where other bands just end up being regressive White Willow is innovative, but there is never any doubt where they get their inspiration from. The music of Willow is deeply rooted in the tradition of 70's progrock bands like King Crimson, Genesis.... but White Willow never end up like sound-a-likes or clones. The music can best be described as dark and introvert symhonic rock. The lyrics reminds me in a way of William Blakes lyrics, probably because of it gnostic tendencies. All the musicians on the record is great, especially lead singer Sylvia Erichsen. If you you like dark symphonic rock this is THE band for you. Jrgen"
2,SET THE WAY BACK MACHINE pt.1,"If you are old enough to remember the AOR music of the late 60's, you will find this interesting. Back then there was plenty of experimental stuff out there. This CD would have fit right in with early King Crimson, Pink Floyd, The Beatles White Album, etc. As a technical exercise it is quite interesting, however as something to enjoy it just doesn't measure up to the band's later releases. The sparseness and openness of the sound scape is striking and the choice of notes is interesting, which is why the professional critics seem to rate this highly. Personally, I like Sacrament and Signal To Noise much better, even though they are not as challenging. By the way, if you like this band, you might also want to consider Pure Reason Revolution's first release, The Dark Third."
4,An album which should be much more well known,"I first bought this album soon after its release in 1999 after it had been recommended on various prog newsgroups and websites; it sounded like something I might like and was pleased with it at the time, although I put it away after a few listens and did not return to it until just recently. This time, I found it even more engaging; it has aged quite well and I would recommend it to any prog fan looking for a mixture of acoustic melodicism, goth atmosphere and the kind of more complex compositional prowess typical of prog (there is, of course, lots of nice keyboard work on the longer cuts). White Willow are to be commended for having built an idiosyncratic sound for themselves rather than copying established prog genres, and their singers are good, which is rare in just about any genre of music these days. This is still the only album I have of theirs but I will soon pick up the others."
2,"Ouch, that hurts!!","This rubber band definitely has enough resistance, but the black part of the band, the part that's supposed to protect your ankles (if you're using it that way), shifts too much, so you're left with doing leg lifts with just the red part. And that hurts! It kind of pinches and leaves a red mark. If I were to need another rubber band, I would definitely search elsewhere."
2,Much larger than it looks...,This toy is huge. My cat is 16 pounds and this is so much bigger than him. It takes up a good amount of space for being a cat toy. Some of the toys are too high up. He only played with the ones that hang down lower. I threw it away after a week. The Panic Mouse is a much better interactive cat toy.
5,Recommended by my sleep therapist,"This was recommended by my sleep therapist and I thought I'd give it a try. I had been using sublingual tablets before and they worked OK. However, this seems to be much more effective and work faster than the tablets. I found the taste pleasant, not really minty, and not offensive in any way. The trick is to shake the bottle first, then curl up your tongue and spray the underside of it, trying to keep the liquid under your tongue for as long as possible before swallowing.Its also nice that the bottle is small enough to bring in your carry-on ziplock baggie through TSA."
5,Wilderness # 39 - Firewater Mini-Review,"This is the first Wilderness book I've read and I really enjoyed it. It's a fast paced book and the story moves along quickly to great climax. There are some great characters like Nate King and his family, Touch The Clouds etc. and loads of action. You get a great feeling of how the Mountain Men and the Indians lived and how much the loved and enjoyed living in the Wilderness, I plan to start the next book SCAR straight away. I Loved my first Wilderness trek and this book is highly recommendedJohn Channing"
5,Yeehaw,"Well, after a shameless self-promoter named Josh IM'ed me on AOL and told me to check them out, i went along with it, and soon discovered i had found one of my new favorite bands....Forbidden Meat will become a classic, and should really get more recognition, as this CD gets more and more amazing with each listen. I rate em right up there with good ol' Pennywise and Lagwagon and what not...if you like punk rock, pick up this CD, you won't be disappointed."
4,best kept secret,"I bought this back in 2001, i also purchased there first self promotion cd. both are quite good. out of these two forbidden meat is by far a classic. i would of given this cd a five star rating but most of the songs are a bit to long. they did do a video and it was pretty funny, i think it was lonely day. anyways go pick this cd up. fat chick always pay inside!"
5,Circo,"Just got the album b/c I saw them perform here in NY. . . love it!Very ecclectic ,etheral, and funky. A great buy!"
3,REGULAR HACIA LO FLOJON,"ESTE TRABAJO ES DE LOS EX DEL MANJAR DE LOS DIOSES. LA ONDA DEL DISCO ES BIEN POPERA RALLANDO EN LA FRESERIA. CIERTAMENTE EL DISCO TIENE UNA BUENA PRODUCCION. ES COMPARABLE A ALEX SINTEK Y A FOBIA. LAS LETRAS SON UNA MEZCLA DE EROTISMO, SANTERIA Y CUENTOS DE HADAS. PARA MI GUSTO ROCANROLERO ESTA REGULAR HACIA LO FLOJON."
3,women and families in counseling,Good information for students in counseling program. Written from a feminist point of view. Would be a good reference to have in one's office library.
5,Excellent Movie!,"Finally! Been waiting a long time for Cab to Canada to make it to DVD...Lifetime Movie Network doesn't show the movie near enough, and it is a very good, heart-warming film.Maureen O'Hara is her usual brilliant self. She and Jason Beghe, as the crusty-yet-lovable Mike, are good as the cabbie and his ""fare"" & to watch them become friends on their journey is touching.The other side is Catherine Bell as Sandy, Mike's girlfriend, who helps care for his irresponsible neighbor's little boy, played by a young Haley Joel Osmant. The scenes with Bell/Osmant are touching as well, as you watch them forge into a respect and friendship with each other.All in all a great feel-good, heartwarming movie, about the value of friendship and the joy of being alive. I'd recommend it to anyone, and as said, THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS OUT ON DVD!"
4,Different....but still good,"A real Montiac (a true Monte Montgomery fan) can appreciate the entire artist package that Monte presents on this CD. If you are buying the CD to hear mind blowing guitar riffs (such as those found on Mirror), then you may be disappointed. This CD focuses on songs, not necessarily the guitar. The songs are much shorter than on prior CD's, thus not allowing his amazing guitar skills to shine through. I can only assume that the purpose of shorter songs is to get radio play. Having the incredible guitar talent overshadows, to some extent, his knack for writing lyrics that are both thought provoking and heart felt. Highlights on this CD are Wishing Well, Soldier at his Best and Broken Arms. But if you really want to see what Monte is all about, go to a live show. No CD can do his incredible talent justice. I can only hope for a live CD down the line."
5,Monte is the total package,"For each of us, there is what we do and who we are. Often, those boundaries become blurred.I've often thought of Monte's guitar playing as what he does and his songwriting as who he is. I don't think we could have possibly hoped for a more sincere and honest look at who Monte is from this piece of work. It also has just the right amount of what he does to please and excite."
2,"Doesn't Rate with ""Mirror"" and ""1st and Repair""","Don't buy this CD without listening to it first. I have Monte's other two CDs and Wishing Well doesn't even compare. Wishing Well is way over-produced with some really gaggy background vocals in some songs. Not nearly enough of his signature acoustic guitar work, which was helping him climb the charts. ""Radio Girl"" made me want to puke! I still highly recommend Monte's music, but just skip over this one. Hopefully, Monte will return to his old form in his future work."
2,Not the Monte You with Whom You Grew Up,"Montiac or not, I simply can't recommend this CD. Gone are his blazing guitar and unique, virtuoso vocals. I truly wanted this CD to be better--I listened to it several times just to make certain I wasn't missing something. Yet, try as I might, I simply couldn't bring myself to appreciate this new (hopefully, brief) departure from the style that sets him apart from all the other mediocre talents in the industry. Bland and boring are the two words that first come to mind. Despite the inflated high scores other reviewers have given this CD, rest assured you will not find many traces of Monte's genius in this effort. Sure, the writing is still there at times; otherwise, I'd rate this effort even lower. I look forward to his next release and pray he returns to his roots."
5,Fabulous Guitar Work - Great Songs,"Monte's done it again! After listeneing to Wishing Well I'm convinced Monte's work just get's better and better. I'm glad to see this Texas Guitar God put out one more example of his awesome guitar work and ""songsmithing"". I gave his earlier CD's Five Stars,but if I could I would give this a ""Seventh Star"""
5,Symphony of Light,"""Siren"" is an amazing CD. The part that absolutely explodes from my speakers comes in the middle of the CD with 4 stellar tracks on 6-9. ""Alone"" has a pop-tango beat that is thoroughly infectious, ""I don't want to be me for a while; I don't want to respond for a while,"" with Ted Bruner's vocals sounding like he has a stuffy nose. ""Go"" is another pop classic rife with hooks, a break and Jon Armstrong's (no relation, unfortunately) hot electric lead zipping up and down the scale at dizzying speed. Matt Hickenbotham gives a bouncy rumba beat to ""Past the Girl"" with a stunning melody and a dreamy George Harrison-like arrangement. ""One Morning"" has some of the most picturesque lyrics, ""I woke one morning to a symphony of light pouring through my window"" complimented by Armstrong's fiery electric lead. The last track ""A Lot Like You"" is another great little pop track. This St. Louis-based band's CD was under my radar screen for quite a while. I'm glad I've finally discovered them! Bravo!"
3,Overrated,"I've had this CD in my collection for years and it hardly made an impression. It's one of those titles I just have and can't say I'm proud of, not that it's alogether that bad, compared to so much of the sound we're hearing on th radio everyday Colony is refreshing, although not entirely new. Toad the Wet Sprocket, Tragically hip, The Hang Ups, The Unbelievable truth, and The Ocean Blue is so much better at this kind of sound. Saturday makes for a good song to fit in between the other bands I've just mentioned but the rest of the album doesn't deviate enough so you just tend to forget the whole lot altogether. Also, the voice doesn't help."
2,You get what you pay for,"Poor tooth design and very slow and cumbersome cutting. Cheap, but not money well spent. Look at saws made by Silky (for example), which appear to be sold on Amazon as well. You will pay 2-3X to get a similar sized Silky saw, but the performance difference is night and day. The Silky saws (with a choice of aggressive to fine tooth spacing) cut effortlessly, and with a fine kerf. If you need a pruning saw to cut say 5-10 branches (under 2"") once or twice a year, you may be happy with the Fiskars. Anything more than that level of usage, and you will appreciate a quality saw over what the Fiskars offers."
5,Fun Peek at Personal Side of the Boys,Attractively presented catalog of postcards to Ringo from the Boys with enlightening annotation. Great conversation piece for the coffee table.
5,.....With a little help from his friends.,"Postcards From The Boys by Ringo Starr, What a wonderful personal look into Ringo's personal friendships with Paul McCartney, George Harrison and John Lennon. Included in this colorful book are reprints of actual postcards sent to Ringo by the other Beatles from exotic locations around the world. Lennon and McCartney even illustrate them with drawings.This is a rare inside look at the ""Fab Four"" outside of the media. A must for every Beatle fan or collector. Thank You Ringo for sharing this with us!"
3,intimate,"it helps you think of the Beatles like common people, friends who send a postcard with a funny remark or news, just like any of us"
2,disappointing,"Certainly not as interesting as I expected it to be. Boring and no ""inside"" insight into ""the boys"". Not recommended."
2,At least the cover looked nice!,"I wasn't that happy with the book. Seeing the personal post cards the Beatles sent to each other over the years seemed like a good concept. I guess it looked better on paper than reality. For one thing, there aren't many postcards.Two: They are just the average postcards anybody gets when someone travels, except more boring. Nothing more than ""having fun, see you soon"". That's about the whole lot of them. Each postcard has a one or two line Ringo quip about it. Sometimes they're interesting, mostly not. The only good thing about it is the fact that it was only $10.00 and some or all of the profits go to charity. Even a die hard Beatle fan won't find much to love about this book."
2,Whatever,"Ringo is a bit sarcastic for my tastes. And he is inconsistent too. At one point he says he wishes people wouldn't talk about ""the break up"" but he cannot resist mentioning the court ""battle"" and the time Paul ""really really pissed George off"" or the time he left and what happened then. He also claims not to have been too involved the process of making Beatles records; if so, why is he so ticked off that he was not recognized as ""the world's greatest drummer""? If I didn't know he was Paul's friend (?) I would certainly think otherwise after reading some of the remarks here. I wasn't expecting such cynicism. But the cover with its changing photos is nice. And the price was ok."
5,There is NO better cream than this!,I absolutely LOVE this stuff...it is one of my postpartum staples and HIGHLY recommended to any of you out there that are pregnant or recently postpartum. I buy it for everyone I know that is pregnant. LOVE IT!
5,Bella B Body Buzz,Arrived in good time and was quality. Got it as a gift for my sister for Christmas and I was very pleased with the product.
5,Anthony B,"I would like to say that this album, and all other releases from Anthony B are incredible. Anthony B is an outstanding roots/dancehall reggae artist. If you like reggae you must add Anthony B to your collection. Jah Rule, one love... Dj-Hasstyle (NYC/Houston)"
5,"Finally, a modern reggae artist with old-school style.","Every song is a winner. He is unique. One of the few reggae albums you can listen to from beginning to end. So good, even reggae unfamiliar friends of mine took to it right away. He ranks up there with Marley and Yellowman."
5,Cliff Notes would be helpful,"Although the book is small, it reads like a long book; I wish Dr. Morehouse would cut the stories and focus on the facts. I can't take a star away, though, because in our world of diet/fitness programs overload, Dr. Morehouse's suggestions are simple yet revolutionary. It's a true lifetime fitness program. The plan can easily be followed.Dr. Norman W. Walker books complement well this book."
4,THIS BOOK CHANGED MY LIFE... HONESTLY!,"""Total Fitness in 30 Minutes a Week"" started me on the road from couch potato to (3:12) marathon runner. I bought it in the late seventies and its regime (which really does only demand 3 x 10 minute sessions a week) showed me that I COULD get fit and feel good about myself.About three years later (1982) I ran my first marathon. I ran my latest in 2004 at age 58. I still do half-marathons, and I still keep fit.It really was, for me, a VERY IMPORTANT BOOK."
5,Get rid of that tape measure!!!,"This tool is a great innovation! Talk about ease of measuring. This tool allows for quick and highly accurate measurments to be taken from anywhere, in any situation. No more dragging long tapes around, trying to get them tight, around furniture, up ladders----forget it all with this great tool. I also now use this in law enforcement for measuring all my crime scenes. No more dragging the tape through blood or across sensitive crime scenes.This tool ROCKS!!!! If you do a lot of measuring than don't let this great help pass you by."
1,Too sensitive to temperature.,"Though a good product, its accuracy varies dramatically when taken out from an airconditioned indoor room or car to out doors.It varies from 1Ft to 3Ft for a distance of 200ft. This makes this product pretty useless."
4,Nice product,I purchased this for my husband... He stated it makes his work much easier... He carries it with him daily.
4,Long time ago...,"I have used this unit and found it very useful. I was investigating the site of one of George Washington's faithful spies property, a Mr. Roe in East Patchogue. The grounds were very overgrown being on Mud Creek. There had been a horse ""farm"" of sorts and we used these units to set out our 50 foot intervals for shovel testing with them through the overgrown parts of the woods. Saved hacking through the environs (which I usually object to) with machetes in places it almost convinced me they should be used all the time, by law, we never know how a property ends up after the lawful survey is done, it might be preserved and then I can't sleep well at night after an overzealous crew has hacked half of it apart."
4,The long arm of the saw,"The saw is very well made and incredibly lightweight. Once I got the hang of it, it only took about five minutes of sawing to get through a 2"" branch.To get the most out of the saw, you have to find a position that works well for you, and keep the blade in the same position for the duration of the sawing. It's very easy for the blade to slip out of the groove you just cut if you aren't careful, and then you have to fanagle it back into place. This happens more the longer you extend the pole, I've found.For what it is, it's a fantastic tool. It won't replace a guy with a bucket truck and an array of chainsaws, but if you've got an unruly tree that needs to be trimmed back a little bit, this might be what you're looking for."
5,special,This is a special ep and a singer who has a special voice.The rich lyrics and wonderful arrangements will leave you wanting more and more. This is the beginning of a wonderful road for the group and I suggest you buy the ep and get in on the wonder.
5,great!,"this cd is just perfect! her voice is sultry and all the songs will get you in a good, calm mood."
2,this is not enough---you need to buy the recharger as well!,"In keeping with the notion that a company makes their realmoney off accessories, you have to buy a special Nikon battery andrecharger. Please note that buying this product is not enough. Youneed both EH-21 AC Adapter /Charger and EN-EL1 Lithium-ionRechargeable Battery. That's over$...! If there's any consolation,the nikon website offers a ... rebate if you buy both together. Ishould repeat what another person said about the batteryindicator. Often the indicator icon says the battery is low when thebattery seems to be working fine. That still does not provide anycomfort. But turning it off and on can do wonders to it."
3,Probably shouldn't buy.....,the camera if you don't want to put out for the charger and batteries. You just have to have it the way digital cameras eat up the power. The only complaint I have about this charger is it does not seem to know when the batterie is recharged or having a problem. Probably just the unit I have but it works fine as long as I'm not in a hurry.
5,"High quality, long-lasting.","Very good bit, the tip is hard anodized so it lasts a long time before wearing out. Associated makes some of the best tools out, and at the best value, period."
5,The definitive A.T.M. sound takes its shape !!,"Well this work, after continued listening, is resembling the jazz progressive style of Area's ""Caution radiation area"", where free jazz meets symphonic prog.Moreover you find the vocals of Alberto Piras from Deus ex Machina,this singer contributing to make it resemble to some Area's stuff once more!!The pyrotechnical vocal performances remind us of the amazing work by Demetrio Stratos (this incredible and unforgettable singer,the greatest in my opinion,can not be emulated anyway!!). Besides there are interesting spare parts at the violin, played by another D.E.M. (Alessandro Bonetti), which make appreciate this modern prog stuff once again...Highly recommended !!"
5,Works Great!,"This little massager really packs a punch. Unlike the bigger, bulkier massagers, this one is quite light. It's not weightless, but certainly has less heft than larger versions. The smaller size, however, doesn't mean it doesn't work as well. In fact, it probably works better than the standard vibrating massager. The massage truly goes deeper than the average handheld massager. We just received this today as a gift, and are already in love with it. The changing of the 3 different heads is not too hard... you just turn it counter-clockwise and unscrew it. It can be a little tight, though, the first time you try to unscrew it. The heated head is alright - not too hot. The cord is nice and long as well. It doesn't have a very obvious ""wave"" motion, as I'd expect from the name, but it does have more movement than the average massager. The price is very fair for the job that it does, and it works better than similar (non-wave) handheld massagers I've tried. A good find!"
2,Useless and Heavy,"I bought this as a present for someone, its not very effective, they left it at my house and has not been touched for over a year. Complete disappointment."
3,just ok,bear and sticks are much smaller than i thought they'd be. one of the sticks was missing from the container and the container itself was covered in dust when it arrived. does keep the kids entertained for 15 to 20 minutes at a time. cute idea but not thrilled with it.
4,I Love this phone,"I have only had this phone for 3 weeks and I love it.I only use it as a phone and a camera. I send text messages, too.I have not used the web, MP3 player, or speaker yet.It is beautiful.My only complaint is that it seems to get dirty quickly with regular handling."
1,big mistake,bought and was exited spent 40 usd for shipping sent to Africa got thanks then screws started falling off.Then i received a sad phone call from Africa.Now i have to find another phone.
1,bad phone,"I adquired a motorola v3i DG for my wife, but the screen falled in blackout after seven days!! I do not understand how is this possible. Initially I supposed a software problem but latter I realized that it was a hardware fault. I lost my money..."
1,why does this not work with Verizon Wireless,I just received my new Motorola RAZR V3i Dolce & Gabbana Phone (Unlocked)by Motorola. I use Verizon for my Services. When I took it there to switch from 1 razor to another - they said they don't support this type of phone. Would this be true or did the salesperson even know. My current razor does not have a Sims card.Thank you
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I am highly disappointed with this product. I have had it for approximately a month now. It rarely stays connected to the Bluetooth, it vibrates even when you turn off that feature, it cost too much to have such limited features. I feel ""Robbed."""
3,In the end...it's still just a cell phone,"This phone I found is over priced, and doesn't work any differently than my mom's razor phone that she got for free from her cell phone provider. If you want a phone that looks like it belongs to a pimp, by all means buy it. In the end, it's still a cell phone. Wasn't worth my time. Hope I spared you from losing some hard earned cash. The phone will lose the ringer or not ring at all depending on how you handle the phone. The buttons on the side are not very ergonomical. I wish I had read the reviews and saved my money."
4,I own this phone and love it.,"I have had this phone since August and I love it. I am constantly complimented on it and people are always curious about it. I have no problems using text messages (someone had said they did) There is a slot for a micro SD card inside the phone (I have a 2GB card) so it doesn't really run slow for me. The phone has additional features a regular razr does not, like airplane mode, iTunes, and what I like best, software that you can transfer pictures to your phone from your computer (make your own wallpaper!) and can make your own ringtones with. Since D&G designed the phone there are some misspellings in the English lol (like dialled calls, personalise for example). There are times when I don't have signal when I should, but there are also times when I get signal when noone else does (like on the subway) so its a coin toss. All in all I love having th phone. It is definitely for people who love to be noticed and show off, and like having a pimped out phone."
5,D & C Motorola RAZR,"Same great phone in a great package. My wife wanted one when we saw them in Ireland in the fall, so I picked it for her Christmas present. People stop her to ask about the phone and her office if envious.Great gift for the woman who has it all!!!!"
1,PLAYED OUT!,"This phone has been featured on the Wives of Orange County, people it's old news and played out! Time to come up with a new design. By the time you see it on TV all the other posers already have them. It no longer is original and it's yesterday's fashion. So if you are thinking about buying it don't because it is too late! Fashion moves quickly, you have to move with it!"
5,Frankly for the Fashionista,"I saw this phone at saks....not to fond of the Razr , however it caught my eye simply because i own a lot of Dolce and Gabbana clothing. With that said....this is a designer phone, one can choose to buy a hanes cotton t-shirt for 10 bucks or a D&G with the same feel for 100+ ( same concept applies to this phone ). If one feels that this phone is out of their price range ( or too expensive ) it's probably because they either can't afford it, or are quite practical with their money .None the less this phone can only be appreciated by fans of the designer. 5 stars for design ( i'm bias to this label over all others ). As far as function I enjoy my cingular 8525 pda"
2,Looks Good BUT,Let me be frank I bought this phone because it looked good. It's beautiful and very easy to use. I usually buy a Nokia. The problem is my phone's battery stopped working in the second month. So I bought a new one. Then people started telling me they can't hear my voice well. So I couldn't talk to them for long. Plus my ear hurts more while using it then using my last phone. Also the golden D&G sign is starting to become silver. I concluded that this phone isn't for me and just bought a Nokia. If you want a phone everyone is going to ohh and ahh over then this is the one for you. In my first week about 25 people told me my phone was gorgeous. But if you want the phone that will last longer then a few months consider what happened to me.
1,Bad Phone. Stay Away,"The Motorola Razr's hype is based on alot of advertising. I had one of these for 2 days. It was horrible. I couldn't hear people talking to me, so I turned up the volume to maximum and then I was echoing in the background. I've heard this phone has had nothing problems.It felt soooo good to say ""GOODBYE MOTO!"""
4,Great!,"Okay, first of all, the review down below which states this phone is only for homosexuals is complete garbage. I'm a heterosexual male and I think this cell is AWESOME!! I've gotten loads of compliments from people asking where I got it, and it also functions as a good cell phone and isn't all about the look. The only problem I have is that when you're trying to sign onto AIM, or download ringtones, photos, etc, it takes FOREVER. Some of the instant messages don't even go through. However, if you don't care about that, by all means, add to cart!"
2,mediocre at best,"for $375 this phone is outrageously pricedonly 1.3MP? how much memory does it come with? Where is stereo bluetooth support? This phone lacks the A2DP Bluetooth profile for stereo bluetooth headsets. For a phone that's over a year old, this is seriously too expensive.the only reason why im giving it 2 stars is for the dolce & gabbana name on it.just take a look at the sony ericsson w810i for example, 2mp camera, 512MB memory stick, upgradeable to 4GBs, and no i am not paid by sony to say this.this is just some old phone with D&G;'s logo slapped on it. It's not hard to find a better phone."
1,Not what you want,"This gold razr is cool looking, but looks too much like some kiddy prize or something and the paint is sure to wear off! so much for a beautiful lookin phone. get the Motorola Razor V3tit is the black one for T-mobileit has a memory card and the motorola symbol on the from flip lights up blue its amazing!!!"
4,The original,"This is the predecessor to today's crime drama television, particularly shows like Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blue. If you are a Law & Order fan, then Naked City is the show that was basically ripped almost shot for shot and line for line. This is truly one of the best TV series of the golden age of television. Dark, gritty, as true to life as it can get. The real star(s) in this show were New York City itself, and the guest stars. The recurring characters played by Paul Burke and Horace McMahon were really as much voyeurs as the at-home viewers. Their characters, like the ones on Law & Order, really are there to service a plot. We learn very little about them over the show's 4 year run. They represent all detectives in the big apple, not just specific ones, who encounter 8 million different stories in the naked city."
5,A Great TV Show!,"I originally saw this show in the mid-1990s. I had never heard of it before but was absorbed by the stories and impressed by the acting. The show wasn't on long and I never had a glimpse of it again. When I saw the DVDs on sale, I was thrilled since I hadn't seen the show in so long but had fond memories of it's excellence. After viewing the 1st DVD set of the show is no disappointment. The show is every bit of good as I remember. It's definitely one of the greatest shows ever made.All of the episodes in this set are wonderful but my favorites are The Face of the Enemy and Oofus Goofus. Both episodes provide a tour de force role for a great actor - Jack Warden and MIckey Rooney. I highly recommend this set and hope you buy it soon."
2,aim to collect entire set and minimize double orders.,"BIG CONCERN***There are 138 episodes of Naked City. I do have the entire list . It would be helpful if you publized the names of the episodes so Ican match which ones I have to those I haven""t. Would it be possible for you to mail me just which episodes you have. My aim is to collect the entire set."
5,Naked City,It was so nice to see this show again. You won't be sorry for buyingthis DVD. I watch it with lots of memories.
5,Wow! These DVDs include the original commercials,"Image doesn't even promote it on the packaging, but all 12 of these episodes include the original commercials. There are spots for Raleigh cigarettes, Bufferin, AC spark plugs, Listerine and many more. And, because Image went back to the original network prints to create these DVDs, they also include the original ""Brought to you by..."" billboards at the beginning and end of each episode.I'm grateful to Image Entertainment for releasing NAKED CITY, and hope they'll release more episodes soon!"
5,Superb reading....a real joy,"Tuck this book into your weekend bag and stow away to some cozy spot, then dive in and enjoy. This one's a huge treat. As the editor of a new art series from Abrams and as someone who does not know Mr. Kimmelman personally, other than as an anonymous admirer of his work, I rejoiced when I read this book, because it teaches, it refreshes, it challenges, and, more than all else, it inspires. Bravo!"
4,Not quite as good as Foma or Halo but still worth the money.,This is a much softer and more mature album than anything the Nixons have done so far. You would be doing yourself a favor by buying this.
3,Vantec should be safe for bottom located air inlets,"I give this 3 stars since I am only commenting on the airflow. My similar review of Diablo Tek USB-Powered cooler pointed out that the airflow dirction is wrong for notebooks which have the air inlet on the bottom, such as the Averatecs. The Targus has the same problem, making it also unsuitable for such computers. This information is often omitted from the specs. Such is the case with Vantec coolers. However, in my search I discovered a review on ""Tom's Hardware"" (...)that says Vantec coolers blow air toward the bottom of the notebook which would make them suitable for Averatec and similar notebooks. It would be helpful if manufacturers and retailers published complete specs. Getting something like this wrong could cause damage."
2,Poor design,"I have had this cooler for one year and both fans are broken. The fan guards on the bottom are too open and do not protect the fans well enough. The first fan on my unit was broken two months after my purchase when a fold of my clothes penetrating the guard while it sat on my lap. The second just broke also. I am not sure how. These fans just seem to be too delicate and exposed. There are other problems as well. I am getting an intermittent power connection at the back which requires an occasional jiggle to keep power flowing. Finally, my Dell laptop has never sat on the unit well. The small flip out feet cannot be adjusted. I am now looking for a more flexible and sturdier cooler. I would not buy a Vantec again."
2,Poorly Constructed,"This is effective in keeping a laptop cool as long as the fans are actually.As noted in another review, the USB powered connector periodically failed after a few months, requiring you to jiggle the wire to get it running again. I have two of these and they both eventually exhibited the same behavior. Now one is completely dead."
1,"Cheap initially, but more expensive in the long run","This review is actually for two of the same kind of laptop cooler, mine and my daughter's. They worked great for a couple months, but then the fan blades on both of the coolers started getting stuck on the inside of their enclosures and breaking off (mine now has 3 blades on one side and 5 blades on the other).My daughter's cooler started to have a problem with the power cord on the end that goes into the cooler itself, and it needs to be jiggled and moved around to find a position in which it will work, and then held in place. Then it stops working again and needs to be jiggled and moved to another position and held in place again.Both of these laptop coolers (my daughter's and mine) are now much louder than they used to be, and they vibrate more, probably from being off balance due to the missing fan blades.My advice is to spend the money to get a better quality laptop cooler that won't break after two months."
4,"collapsible, but slight design flaw","I have two of these. The feet and legs fold up and allow it to slide into my laptop bag without the risk of tearing them off. Unfortunately, like mentioned in other reviews the power connector on the circuit board is only head in place by the soldered connections. On my two units, these connections appear to be what is known as 'cold' solder joints. They were either not cleaned properly or not hot enough when the solder was applied, so they will come lose over time. If you add to that the fact that these solder connections are also taking on the stress of having the power chord plugged in and removed they will not last that long at all."
4,Very helpful - retrofitting a 20 year-old car.,"When I inherited a '93 Escort without a radio I was dumb founded. This wiring harness allowed me to connect to the ""factory"" wiring harness without having to resort to guesswork of what is where. Carxtc is my first choice for all wiring needs. I've recommended carxtc to several students who were in the process of enhancing their classic ride."
5,A Great Product Gets Better!,"Fix-it Utilities is an all-in-one suite of programs that fix problems and fine tune your computer for maximun efficiency and protection. The defrag utility has been improved as has the disk fixer. The registry clearner and registry defrag utilities are the best available. The antivirus program is top notch. It takes up less hard drive space than Norton or McAfee (about 100 mb less). Also, new with this version is a selective install that lets you install only the components that you want. In short, a great utility gets better. Anyone running Win 9X, Win ME and Win NT 4 and above should not be without it."
2,Disappointing.,"I bought this program to ""fix"" the various start up bugs in win 98 along with other program glitches that my old Norton software used to fix on win 95. Fix-it has better graphics, action video as the program runs and lots of lists on what it is doing, but never fixed and supported my programs like the Norton programs did. After plowing on through the complicated instructions, I'm back to Norton for the win 98 and never looking back. Fix-it does have a good defrag program, but so did dos. For me, it was very disappointing."
4,Good porch lights,"Purchased three of these lights for my back porch along with 40 watt vintage style bulbs.Bulbrite 134019 40W Nostalgic Edison Squirrel Cage-style BulbPleasantly surprised to find that fixtures included a decent length of cord and an outlet cover with a strain relief.Installation was straightforward, with the only issue being the strain relief. The unit must be tightened with a wrench while pushing down to avoid stripping the plastic threads.Very satisfied with the appearance, the units are gray as shown, with a white reflector. My original intention was to paint them a dark green, but they look fine as-is.Bulbs and fixtures give off the perfect amount of light and cover a 30' x 8' area."
5,Logic an outline,"While this is an older book,1962, it is still an excellent primer or supplement to other texts on logic. What Robert Sharvy has done is take his lecture notes from his years of teaching at Lake Forest College and placed them into a well composed and easy to follow outline of his logic course. Sharvy does not assume that the reader has had any background in the topic and brings the reader easily through the nuances of logic. The book is divided into four parts: Aristotelian Logic, Symbolic Logic, Induction, and Semantics. To the student of logic or just someone curious about the, subject this book is a rare jewel if you can find it. Gregory Luther"
1,This won a Best Picture Oscar?,The only good thing about this film is Irene Dunne's performance. Richard Dix shamelessly hams it up. The rest of the film is a mess (with the possible exception of the Oklahoma land rush scene). Purchase this ONLY if you must.
1,Why?,"Dull portrayal of the American pioneer experience. Essentially worthless, except as a head-scratcher when discussing Oscar history."
3,"Expansive, But Very Dated","This film is very dated and does not hold up well when measured by today's standards. Therefore, it may be hard to believe that not only was it the fourth film to win the best picture Academy Award, but that it also won the awards for screenplay adaptation and art direction.Its principal value at this point would appear to be in an historical sense, for it depicts events, such as the Oklahoma land rush and the old west generally, that were not that far removed in time when this film was made. There were people living at the time of the filming, who had personal recollection of the events depicted. So don't dismiss the film out of hand, but, rather, view it in the context of its time."
2,How the west was spun,"Clunky is the nicest term I can apply to this Oscar winning film. Dated, is another good term to describe it. I've seen it twice and don't have plans to watch it ever again. There is only one good sequence in this overlong western: the land rush. Unfortunately, that's at the beginning of this long epic and what follows is riddled with clichés and bad acting. Stereotypes abound, the dialog is patently silly, the Oscar nominated performance by Richard Dix has to be seen to be believed. (Nothing about his performance is natural or lifelike. It's a cartoon: his wild eyes perpetually crazy, his head jerking as he struck these florid poses to bloviate the dopiest dialog ever imagined. This was not method acting, unless, there was method to his madness?)I only enjoyed the incomparable Edna May Oliver as the local busy body; everything else was just tedious and dull.Not a keeper because there are much better westerns to be had."
2,"Very Dated, Only Historically Valuable!","One of the most dated of all the early 'talkies'. While it is big in scope, hammy acting, bad editing and bad writing are impossible not to notice. One of the film's major flaw is Richard Dix's performance, overly pompous and campy, if you look at it in another way, it's amusing in a campy way, but that certainly wasn't his intention, and that's what's funny. Irene Dunne gives a tolerable performance, but not even that can make the film interesting. Overlong and sometimes challenging to sit through, also some racial aspects might offend some. Only historically valuable. Extras: this was the first western to win 'Best Picture' Oscar, the next one would be 'Dances With Wolves' in 1990. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 4!"
2,Agree with the others,"I've seen the other reviews on this movie, and must concur. It is a very racist film, even as it tries to make the 'red man' into full blown citizens. Unfortunately that simply was how things were back then. The general story was decent, probably butchered by the screenplay. Editing is a riot, especially when Sabra is seen wearing a light dress, then one bad edit later is seen wearing a noticably darker dress in the same scene. Yancey is a rotten husband, too. Despite efforts to make him a courageous man."
3,Cimarron,"You have to judge pictures like Cimarron not by today's standards but by the state of the art when it was made. From that perspective, Cimarron fares better. Every movie I've seen that was made in the twenties and thirties is more or less ""dated"". But this movie featured Irene Dunne on her way up and Richard Dix on his way down. It isn't politically correct. It isn't well paced. And it isn't the best movie to come out of the early thirties; but I know some people who consider it one of the best ""cowboy"" movies ever made. That's a stretch I think, but it was an interesting movie from an historical point of view. And as one viewer already pointed out, Irene Dunne's role and performance of it was very good for the time. Based on that, I'll give it three stars."
4,Outstanding Work,"This was one I had to watch 2-3 times before I got it, and boy! Do I get it now. It helped seeing it on the big screen a few years ago. One comes to understand how Yancey is one who needs to be on the move, as his is the type who is always needed to settle the West. Everyone's marvelous in this melancholy film about the sacrifices needed to settle this part of the nation. This was included in my book 'Head `Em Off At the Pass! 94 Westerns You Should Watch' in more detail.Head `Em Off At the Pass!: 94 Westerns You Should Watch"
4,Great addition to my collection,Fantastic I love watching the Oscar winning movies in order to see how film has evolved. Again a very good movie
3,Venom is awesome!,"fast shipping and very good toy... but the ""slime"" it is too messy! my grandson had it all over... hard to clen up."
3,Is there good battery for Nikon 4500,"Battery (Nikon 4500) shows half does not means 50% left, actually there are 25%-35% left, is there battery can tell more exact number ? That will be great one."
1,Poor product quality,This product was of vary low quality and the seller (Cables 4U) does not stand by his product and make prompt refunds.
1,"Product is fine, seller is the problem","I purchased this battery and the seller sent the wrong battery and I had to pay for it be returned. Got the correct battery on the next try, but I am not happy with paying for someone else's mistake. I have not had time to really use the product for the reason above. So for little time I had the wrong product I could not of course use it, nor could I use it as it was shipping back. Since that time I have only had a working battery for approximately a week. This took 3 weeks to get the correct battery so I could use it. This is starting from the date the original battery was shipped. Look carefully at who sells this.Nikon EN-EL1 Rechargeable Battery for Nikon Coolpix 775, 880, 885, 995, 4300, 4500, 4800, 5000, 5400, 5700 & 8700 Digital Cameras"
4,"They work, but seem to have limited recharging times",I use my old Nikon 995 all of the time. So I find that I have to buy new rechargeable batteries every few years because they seem to lose the ability to retain a charge for longer periods the more they are recharged.
1,Never Received,I never received this item and have placed the charge into dispute with my credit card company.
1,watch out for replacement batteries; ie not Nikon,"I ordered a Nikon battery and rec'd an after-market battery, even though it was advertised as made by Nikon. It would be best to call the seller and verify before ordering."
1,Do not buy. Battery was DOA.,"I bought this battery because it is OEM by Nikon and would benefit from good quality control. The battery was delivered propmptly, but was defective and would not charge. Another recent reviewer Nov. 2008 had a similar experience, so this is not an isolated event. Perhaps their stock is not fresh. In fairness to Amazon the refund process was timely. However there is still the factor of lost time and disappointment/frustration of receiving a defective product. I ordered the same OEM battery from another (non-Amazon) vendor for about $4 more. I received a working battery via FEDEX in 2 days. Sweet."
1,Nikon Camera Battery,The Nikon EN-EL1 Rechargable Battery I purchased from Amazon was DEAD on arrival. Wrote email to provider via Amazon over a week ago and have not heard anything from anyone. Very disappointed in Amazon!!!!
5,life of battery,I have the nikon coolpix 4300 digital and two of these batterys. They work great as long as they last which is not 2 hours in my case. Maybe it is because I leave the monitor and flash on most of the time and take my pictures in a large size. All in all with two of these battery's I never run out of juice!
1,Do not buy!!,I bought this battery from SF Planet. It is useless. I believe it is yet another counterfeit version of this battery. It does absolutely nothing in the camera. I guess you have to go directly to Nikon and pay their price in order to get a genuine version of this battery.Do not buy! I learned the hard way.
1,buying defective equipment,I got this unit and it was defective. I tried e-mails toboth the seller and Amazon and got no response from either.I had to take it to the next level and challenge the chargeon my credit card to try to get someones attention !
5,"old camera, new battery","I have a very old, but still reliable Nikon Cool-Pix (This was my second Cool-Pix, but the first still works too.) However, its battery ends in a ""1"" and they are no long possible to find in retail stores, where 9 and 10 are the batteries of today. I ordered two of these (always want an extra handy at important events) and popped it in my charger. It was fully charged and on the job the next morning. They both work perfectly and allow me to take many pictures before needing a rechange. Thanks!"
5,Can't go wrong with Nikon,"You can buy cheaper replacement batteries, but you are gambling on quality at best. Many are just cheap knock-offs. I tend to stick with original name brand replacement. That way you know exactly what you are getting. The EN-EL1 that came with my Nikon camera worked reliably for several years and only recently did I see charge life diminish. I bought this new one as a primary battery and will use the old one as a spare. I would highly reccomend going with the EN-EL1"
1,battery defunct,"The battery wouldn't accept a charge. I returned it to the seller to an address he provided. I heard nothing and had to email several times and finally complain via Amazon to get a refund- which I'm told by seller has been made, but I haven't seen it on my credit card statement yet."
3,Broke almost immediately--but great customer service,"The first time I tried to use this tool with any force, it snapped in half. I'll be returning it for a refund and applying the credit to a solid steel tang hori-hori, like I should have gotten in the first place.I should have updated this review years ago. Someone at the company contacted me almost immediately after I posted this, and offered to send me a new one at no charge. I've been using that one regularly now for four years and it has proven durable and my very favorite yard tool.So I can't tell you that the one you get won't break, but let the company know if it does!If the 1st one shipped had been the second one, 5 stars. As it happened, 3 stars."
3,"Good design, backed up by Fiskars","I love the feel of my Fiskars' garden knife. But after only a little while of use, the handle came loose from the blade. I wrote Fiskars' customer service, and they responded promptly with a new product. I use it all the time. I'd change the stars to 5 if they'd let me."
5,"Japanese Garden Knife ""hori hori""","As a landscaper, I have used this type knife for years. Some laugh because I don't even own a trowel. What I can tell you is that initially I hesitated buying these because they weren't the old fashioned wooden handled variety I have used in the past. Ultimately, I bought two for my crew and they have been thrilled. You would have thought I gave them gold by the way they talk about them. As for the grip handle, it is a perfect design and much easier on the hands."
1,warning,"unfortunately I could only read this warning when the knife arrived at my house:California Proposition 65 warning:This product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer,birth defects and/or reproductive harm.Who would want to work in their garden with a tool that can cause cancer ?Too bad, I was really excited to try it."
2,Handle fell off!,"I've had this knife for about 2 years and I used it moderately to divide perennials. It has worked fine for that purpose until I used it for the first time this spring and the handle slipped off. The big-grip handle is glued to the metal shaft and the glue seems to have deteriorated with age. If you are interested in a garden knife, I would recommend something with a forged handle since these tools see some tough duty, glues and plastic aren't going to last."
1,First bad Fiskars!!,"Through the years I have enjoyed using Fiskars products. They are typically well designed and well built. This is not the case with the garden knife. As others have noted, the tool breaks at the joint between the handle and the blade. My wife (5'-4"" and 125 lbs.) was using it digging in our garden and weeding when it broke. The point is that inappropriate force was not used when it heppened. I have since bought an OXO and it appears to be sturdy, but it costs twice as much. I guess you get what you pay for, even if it is a Fiskars."
1,Broke easily,"I read the reviews here, assumed the people who broke it had exceeded reasonable tolerances, and so I went ahead and bought it. It was great for about 3 weeks. Then it snapped at the handle. And I wasn't prying hard at all. Recommend get one that is solid shank, not cheap weld."
1,CHINA CHEAP,"This item WILL rust. Thin ""chrome"" finish.This item has a cheap and weak handle! Thin gauge metal extends only a third of the way into handle. WILL break sooner rather than later.Come on! If you are going to have your stuff made in China Specify good materials and a good design! OH and watch them to see that it gets done right.I am SO sick and tired of wasting time and money on cheap Chinese ""products"".Fiskars was good stuff not so long ago...sad so sad..."
4,Great for rose pruning,"I use this knife for rose pruning. It works great for ripping potting soil bags, removing weeds rather than my pruners. It needs a holder so you can attach it somewhere so you don't have to constantly remember where you put it. Nice and sturdy and far less expensive than other similar models"
4,Great little garden tool,"This handy little knife/trowel is perfect for not-so-perfect gardening. It slides through rocky soil and roots. Hadn't planned on buying it, but sure glad I did."
4,Worth buying a replacement,"After 3 years of very heavy use mine broke. However, for the price and the beating I put it through I feel its worth another try. After buying this hoping it would be an easy way to plant small bulbs like crocus and snowdrops (worked very well) it quickly because my go to for just about everything and the only thing I'd use for weeding. I used it many times in heavy soil with no problems, but it did snap in half when I had it pried against a rock getting a weed out. I was surprised by the rather small weld point, but again for the amount of use it gave me in three years I didn't hesitate to go online and buy a new one right away."
1,IL Mastergardener,"I lost my hori hori knife which was outstanding, so being frugal I purchased this garden knife. It broke almost immediately while digging out a dandelion root. My husband said the welds were done poorly. The hori hori knife on the other hand is one piece of metal that continues through the entire handle. So I am reodering the 1516 hori hori knife. GRRRRRR!"
3,big sturdy garden knife,"Appears the blade is welded to the handle, but feels sturdy. Is nowhere near as sharp as most garden knives like the hori hori types."
5,Multifunctional Tool,This is our favorite new tool. It is great for digging out stubborn weeds. It also works well for planting and has a cutting edge for dividing things like hostas.
1,Made of the tears of a thousand untrained taiwanese child welders.,"This is a piece of crap. In retrospect, I'm surprised it didn't shatter into a million, irretrievable pieces while releasing of puff of haunting laughter from a Fiskars executive as soon as I opened the packaging. I don't know where this was made, but I imagine that the problem was that the 8 year old sweat shop worker's tears kept dripping off of her cheeks and screwing up her weld surface. This is outrageous, Fiskars, as I fully expect you to force your child laborers to weld while wearing sweat bands and facemasks."
4,Garden work,The knife is very strong and useful in the garden. I think if it had a holster or sheath to keep it in it would improve it's usefulness.If it available let me know.
1,Keystone Cops,"The title of this video is very misleading. The title should actually be ""Keystone Cops, where are you? "" There are a few cops in the video briefly but I doubt they are the Keystone cops. Also, the soundtrack in the video is very annoying."
2,Where are the Cops?,I'm wondering why this video is called Keystone Cops. Can anyone tell me? The Cops appear twice and then only fleetingly. I also hate the music
3,Interesting Old Film,"These are very early and influental comedies. However, they are not particularly funny. They seem mean and pretty much the same from one to another. Also, I gripe, the video is only 56 minutes in length. The music score is unrelated and has talking comedy bits which are very distracting to the watching of the film. It is very historical, so indeed it is worth buying, especially at that price."
4,The most practical chemical engineering reference book,"For the working chemical process design engineer, this is the best reference I've come across. It tells you how to pick equipment and generally how to determine equipment sizes. As a design or procurement engineer you work with vendors to make final equipment selection, but this book gives you what you need to know before you start talking to the vendors. It bridges the gap between theory you can get from textbooks and detailed applications you can get from sales literature. I'm surprised this book hasn't caught on as a standard in the chemical engineering profession"
2,More of an advertisement than a diet book,This book is more of an advertisement for Kathy Feldman's crunch bars than a book on raw diets. I would not recommend spending your money on this one.
2,Informative???,"I was really looking forward to recieving this book as I thought it might hold some answers to some questions I had regarding weight loss, especially as a person with hypothyroidism. It provides a diet plan, but the plan requires purchasing the products that are not that easy to get. I would say that if you want a book that will inform you on raw dieting, this one is not the best. The book is very small and really just an advertisement for the raw crunch products. I don't believe I gained much insight with this one. I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Came without head cover as advertised,"This club seems fine, but it came without the head cover. Yet the photo shows that it's supposed to be included."
1,Club came broken,"Ordered this club for my daughter who wanted a hybrid in her bag. Unfortunately, the box came crushed and the club shaft was broken into three pieces. I would have asked for a replacement, but was told this was the last one in stock. I did receive credit as promised, but would have preferred a new club."
5,Delightful and Refreshing,"I discovered this man's work in a trendy restaurant in Mexico. A rather talented guitar player stated about Linstead's magnificent picks and melodies, ""You just don't pick up a guitar and do that. It takes practice and discipline."" There are moments of sheer brilliance in this CD and in all of Linstead's work. (I highly recommend Sol Luna Tierra). This is flamenco. It is guitar based, with a backdrop of native drums and bass. It is Latin. If you want some thing new, with a degree of talent rarely found in popular music, something that will make you get up and dance, as well as gasp and cry, this is it."
3,A combination of intense laughter and fast-forwarding.,"Nothing gets me laughing harder than some of their stunts. On the flip side, nothing is as distasteful as some of their antics. If could only watch the ""cleaner"" stuff, then I'd give it a higher rating."
3,Classic Lloyd with an interesting twist: jazz guitar,"This is typical Charles Lloyd material, but with the addition of a fine jazz guitar. The updated (3rd recorded version, that I am aware of) cover of his most famous hit Forest Flower is unique and interesting. Nothing earth shattering here, but you will not be disappointed either."
3,Vernon Fitch certainly did no slacking with his research,"This is THE most detailed and expansive resource for Pink Floyd info. That said, it's a true encyclopedia. Don't buy it expecting to read through it, because although its really cool to know specifically what guitar David played in WYWH, you'll find yourself skipping over the page to the next section.Recommended."
5,A TITAN'S WORK!,"I THINK VERNON FITCH IS MORE THAN A FLOYD FAN OR A ROCK HISTORIAN. TO BE ABLE TO COMPILE ALL THESE NAMES, DATA, FACTS, ALBUM NO, RELEASE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO BE A WORKAHOLIC IN FLOYD MATTERS.I WONDER WHAT THE FLOYD MEMBERS THINK ABOUT THIS BOOK (THE 3RD EDITION OR ANY PREVIOUS ONE).GOOD WORK, VERNON!AND, OF COURSE, THANKS FROM THE BIGGEST PF FAN IN ROMANIA!"
1,Not worth the money,"Don't spend your money on this book, there is a lot of repetive stuff in it. Also, if you already work in the field of ASIC design, you will not learn much in this book, trust me."
1,Worst litter box ever,"It didn't scoop, it scattered litter everywhere, and it made tons of noise. Also, the Kitty Cabana accessory is very poorly made. Even the hand tool that comes with this product is undersized and not functional. I replaced it with a regular deep litter box with a hood."
1,This model is a piece of crap!,We loved our original littermaid. It lasted for five years and we could use any scoopable litter. It was the one that the prongs were plastic and they were not removable. It scooped out all the poop. This model stinks! It doesn't scoop out the poop. The pee gathers at the bottom because the prongs do not reach to the bottom of the box. The poop gets caught just before the bin and the time between scoops is too prolonged. DO NOT BUY the littermaid elate with the removable prongs!!!! We have to clean the box manually daily even though the box is on.
1,Completely Worthless,"Even when using their Brand litter, this box is useless. It scatters clumps, jams, and the motor sounds like a small a/c airplane landing in your apartment. I only have one cat, so we are talking maybe two daily visits This is a joke and the company should have to refund money back to anyone who purchased it."
1,Don't waste your money!,"One of the worst designs imaginable. Won't scoop even a clean litter box, much less any clumps from cat waste. If you want a self-cleaning litter box that isn't self-cleaning, go ahead and buy this one. It's also very noisy. After the forth try before it gives up on scooping the litter box, I grow very angry because the noise goes on forever and you know you will also have to manually scoop the automatic litter box. I hate being taken in by false advertising. The FTC should go after this company!"
2,LitterMaid LM5000 Automatic Cat Litter Box,Does not perform as expected. I haven't found a cat litter that clumps hard enough for the prongs to move continuously in to the waste receptacle. It always gets bound up.
1,Junk,"My family is on our 4th liter maid. The other three were all the basic litter maids, and all worked ok for several years before jamming up beyond repair. This last time we replaced it with a litter maid elite. What a piece of junk. For starters, it just feels cheaply made. After assembly, I discovered that the trays don't fit properly either. Cutting off the corners seemed to get them to fit, if barely. Once I filled it with litter, I came across another problem. The motor is so underpowered, that it struggles just to even out the liter. If I fill it to the fill mark, it can just make the full cycle. If I fill it to full mark, it jams. This is before the cat got to it. Even with the minimum amount of litter, it is unable to clean the box after the cat uses it. I now have to every day go and clean the litter for it. This defeats the purpose of having the thing in the first place. I might as well have just bought a plain box and saved some money.The litter maid elite is completely useless."
1,Do not waste your money.,"If I could have scored it at a minus number, I would have, especially for the price. My 1 cat just needed a taller litter box, but I trusted a friend who told me she has 3 cats & just takes it out once every week or two. Either we are totally different on a cleanliness level or hers version is better than what I bought. In her defense, she said she didn't have to put anything together. I did. I'm now cleaning out one heck of a mess every other day or two as the yuck goes through cracks in it and onto my floor. Wish I would have bought a way cheaper, simply taller box."
1,A cardboard box would be better,"This Littermaid Elite Box is absolutely worthless. Right from the beginning, the rake would not scoop the litter and I would have to go and hand-scoop it myself. If I did not scoop it in a couple of days, the wet litter would become a messy clay that would get stuck behind the rake. I finally got frustrated and had to throw the whole thing out. A cardboard box or a $5 plastic tray would have been better. I've had the basic LitterMaid model in the past and went back to that model and am very satisfied with that one."
2,Littermaid Elite Box,"The cat box was received quickly and timely. Upon receipt I found that there was a couple of parts missing. The parts missing were the litter pan and the power supply. The box was obvously used, (no problem) but when I powered up the unit, it did not function correctly. It cycled foward and back every few seconds. I am in electronics and found a defective limit switch. This could be a problem for someone else. The unit is functioning correctly now and I am satisfied with my purchase."
1,Not as Advertised - not powerful enough to move 2 poops,If you have 2 cats or a large cat this is not going to work for you - and litter is everywhere.Returned it in less than one week.C
5,Amazing!,"As a guitarist I have sought out various books to help me in my endevour to learn the guitar. This book is astounding!I have always wanted to just pick up a guitar and play, or play lead while another person is playing rhythem.I highly recommend this book for anybody seeking to learn scales, chords, and just about anything else!I love it!I'm sure you will too!"
1,garbage,"The screws that come attached to the bedposts are not long enough to be inserted into the holes of the planks. It's also impossible to see what you are doing when trying to bang the screw into the hole with a rubber mallet (mallet not included). Also, it's a terrible idea to bang the posts into place with a rubber mallet, because it the rubber makes a black imprint all over the wood. While I was banging the pieces into place, the screws ripped off. I've put together many beds, and this is the worst. An absolute piece of garbage. I phoned the company to tell them about my problems, and I encountered only rudeness and condescension. Avoid this company and this bed."
5,Love Arcadia Books,"Anytime I want to learn more about the history of a location, I always see if Arcaidia has a book on the topic, and they usually do -- easy to read, great old images and well researched"
4,Good torx set,Good assortment of torx bits. Quality is good havn't broken one yet. Cheaper than off the tool truck.
4,tools,The tools are adequate quality. They worked well for my job. The case was nice and will keep the tools together.
1,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap","The sockets work fine, but the torx are weak. I broke off a T27 in the drain plug on my transmission! Yes, the drain plug! Do yourself a favor and just cough up the extra few dollars, go to Sears, and buy Craftsman."
3,e-Torx sockets,These seem to work fine. I like the plastic case they come in.If I was to order again I would buy Sears. Life time warrenty and match the rest of my tools.
5,Right tool for the right price,"I found this set of Torx bits to be fantastic as it offers the odd sizes and types like the security bits that are hard to find. For your weekend mechanic, this set will cover most of your need when you work on your car and come across that odd type of bolt. It's been especially helpful when I work on my Porsche, which comes with a variety of bolts that aren't covered in the standard set of sockets.For the price, it's hard to beat this set."
1,Taebo CD disappoints,"As someone who has been to Billy Blanks' studio in L.A., I was deeply disappointed in the CD. The beat is fast enough, but slow compared to his live workouts. The music is bad - oldies remixed and sung by elevator music performers. The addition of Billy's voice exhorting me to ""work it girl"" made me want to laugh, far from encouraging they contribute to the overall cheesiness of the production. Instead of getting a hot new set of fast-paced tunes to work out to, I got a workout CD that could have been produced by anyone - there is nothing special about this collection, and there's alot better out there."
4,Great insight into role of the Speaker,"I thouroughly enjoyed this book. It covered each topic just enough with a good balance of political, social, and personal aspects and how the three inter-related and affected the subjects. For someone just beginning to understand the history of the House, it is a great book to read."
3,Nice explanation,I bought this book after reading this review and to supplment my college text. This book is really made for people with sound calculus knowledge which has been said by fellow reviewers. I think this book is little bit expensive but nonetheless good to read.
1,Helpless At Osu,"This book was awful. It made no sense at all. It tells you infromation and does not adquately explain the source. There is no information like charts and the like to help you out and no diagrams to keep your attention. The questions do not make any sense. They have taken simple Kinematics and turned it into something as difficult as Quantum mechanics or Astrophysics. I do not recommend this book to anyone, especially phyics majors because it will deter you from that field really fast. Believe me!"
4,Good Stuff,"I used this book in my freshman honors physics class at Cornell, and it is a great physics text. Brain-twisting problems force the beginning physics student to start thinking like a physicist. Explanations are clear and lucid, and sufficient background is given in mathematics early on. Highly recommended."
4,a challenging read,"This book is very thorough. Anyone succeding in reading it will feel like they can solve almost any mechanics problem (at least those in other, lesser texts). However, all is not well, as the writing style is dry and somewhat cryptic, and the price is outrageous."
3,A challenging introductory mechanics text.,"Kleppner does thoroughly cover most topics, but I have found the book cryptic. The connection between the text and the included problems seems vague at best. This book should not be used by someone who has no previous exposure to mechanics and/or is uncomfortable with calculus. However, for students with some exposure to physics and calculus looking for a book which explains physics at a higher level and with a more mathematical basis than most introductory mechanics texts, it does provide a good challenge."
4,Loud!,"I bought this model when it was offered by Devilbis in 1999. Never had to use it other than for routine tests until Isabel came through. We were out of power for two days, and the gen performed great! I have it wired into the house with a 10 circuit EmerGen transfer switch. I could run most of the house, my computers, fridge, freezer, and well pump with not sweat. I would power off the refrigeration and well pump when running the water heater, which took 5000 watts according to the meters. Electric start is great. But this thing is way too loud. Fortunately, I live in a rural 'hood in the PA mountains, and about 1/2 the residents had gen's running too, so mine didn't stand out too much. I'm looking for a solution to the muffler."
3,sponge bob smart cycle software review,This item was purchased as a gift and is being used by a 4 year old boy who is enjoying it!
3,I like the bike but hate the game,"I purchased the bike for my 3 year old son. One game came with the bike and he liked it, but got board. Sponge Bob is his favorite character so I ordered this game. The game was so stupid. It was almost exactly like the game that came with the bike. The only difference is it was Sponge Bob themed."
2,Not recommended,"The bike for the toy drain the batteries and it broke down in less than 6 months, the games were ok, but I would not recommend to buy the bike. I got it for my 4 years old but I also have other 2 kids, and only one kid can play at the time...too much of a hassle, maybe good for an only child, but the bike is too expensive for the quality of the game..you better off buying a Wii."
5,Thanks!,"I have wanted this for my child for a Christmas present, because he loves sponge bob and you all were set at a lower price then what i would have bought it for."
1,Poor Quality,"The quality of this game leaves much to be desired. My original Super Mario Brother's Nintendo game from 1987 had better sound quality than this game. Sponge Bob's voice is garbled and sounds terrible. He doesn't even sound like Sponge Bob. It's really quite annoying. No, it's not my television... all my DVDs, tv shows, and my XBOX 360 games are awesome on it. I love Sponge Bob, he's one of the few cartoons I can stand to watch with my daughter... but this game is a HUGE disappointment. I can't believe I spent $40 on this thing. I wish I could get my money back. Well not really. I just wish the people who made it cared more about the kids they were making it for. I wish they put more effort into their product and produced a game worth the price."
4,actress playing an actress,"Bette Davis is at her vintage best in ""Dangerous"" from 1935. She plays the volatile and tempestuous Joyce Heath, a stage actress who has disappeared from Broadway. She is rescued by architect Donald Bellows, who finds her well into her cups in a dive at a shooting gallery amusement park.Needless to say, he falls in love with her and resurrects her stage career by footing the cost of a new production. He also breaks his engagement with society deb Gail Armitage. Watch the movie for the ensuing plot turns, tears, and heartwarming conclusion.Like so many Depression-era movies, this served as escapist entertainment, taking place in the wealthy world of New York society, with luxurious settings and what passed for ""upper class"" accents of the time. ""Dangerous"" is a must-see for all Davis fans."
4,"Great guide, preferred older book layout","I buy the Audubon books for my young son and I. We both enjoy using them often when we've spotted an animal, plant, insect or just about anything that we want to identify. Many times I have spotted my son with his nose buried in our old book searching for a picture to match a bug he has found. We both also agree that we like the layout of our older Audubon book where the picture and the information on that picture are on the same page. Much quicker than the new book layout where you must find a connecting page to read about your subject."
5,Paul Lukas at his peak,"This is a very special movie, the kind they don't make any more, about a time not too long ago, when the world went mad. Highly recommended for old film buffs, but noy for the faint of heart."
3,"it was ok, but too short and sometimes cheesy","wish the trip was longer, more footage, more people featured, could've been better but its good. pay no more than $15 total though."
3,Average,"I was a little surprised that the tree is not as vibrant in appearance as I expected. In the picture, it appears to be handpainted, but it is clearly manufactured in reality. Moreover, the Ark which sits atop the tree simply balances in a hole. It is not very secure. I fear my mobile child pulling it over atop him. Nevertheless, it is handy and serves its purpose."
3,Good Start But Lots of Room To Improve,"I picked up Kale's CD a few months before seeing him perform with Tabla Beat Science at Stern Grove in San Francisco. His performance live outshone his studio effort. To me, ""Realize"" was full of potential - tracks that seemed like they were going to set out to be incredible and instead ended up being repetetive, lengthy, and not so creative. In this whole ""Asian Massive"" movement, I wouldn't rank this CD as the one to get. I'd definitely put MIDIval Punditz' self-titled CD and Talvin Singh's ""Ha"" much higher - nevertheless, Kale is very promising and I've faith that he'll only improve moving forward."
3,Mediocre..,"My computer came with one of these songs already installed on it as a sample.. I really liked it, so I bought the CD. Unfortunately, every song on it sounds pretty much the same. The only reason I give it a generous 3 stars, is because someone else might like the sound so much that they want to hear it over and over and over.."
5,Awesome Music,I have to admit Karsh Kale knows how to make good music. I just plug my headphones in and can listen to the music all day.
3,"Good, but not great.","Many of the songs on this album were promising but didn't live up to their potential. Instead, the album is slightly bland. Not bad...just bland. If you want to ""get your feet wet"" with the 'Asian Massive/Asian Underground' sound go pick up the ablum by Kale's labelmate State of Bengal. State of Bengal's ""Visual Audio"" (5 stars) is a much better album and a better place to start if you want to expose yourself to this type of electronica. Talvin Singh's ""OK"" (4 stars) is not too bad either."
3,Joe's notebook,"My 3 year old was desperate for a 'handy dandy notebook', and nothing from a stationery store would do: it HAD to look like the thinking chair. Now, with each Blue's Clues episode, he can draw the clues along with Joe (or Steve), and he's delighted! However, for all the joy that it brings, I am conscious that the laminated pages absorb water and warp VERY quickly, and that it would just take one, unnoticed spill to ruin what has turned out to be a very expensive toy: with almost [$...] to ship to NZ, the total cost of this toy doubled to [$...] - way more than I think necessary!!"
3,hefty pricetag for a notebook,When my first child was into Blues Clues I was able to buy this off the rack - 9 years ago. Now my third daughter discovered some old DVD's and just has to have a notebook but I remember that it wasn't that durable and almost choked when I saw that it was going for $15 or more. Are they collector's items? Like others I remember that the crayon doesn't work really well on the laminated pages and that they do easily damage from water and tear from the binder. It would be worth the price if it was refillable paper
1,Defective Product,"I liked this heating pad so much when I first used it that I immediately ordered a second one (for what I expected would be a year or two in the future). What I liked was that the wiring was indeed much thinner than other pads, allowing it to conform to the shape of my body. However, the first pad lasted only two weeks before failing to heat. I returned it to HomeMedics and they ignored me. The second one lasted nearly a month before it to failed to heat. I will not bother wasting the postage to return this one, as obviously HomeMedics does not care about quality nor customer satisfaction. I recommend that you not waste your money on this defective product."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!,HAD THIS FOR LESS THAN A MONTH AND IT JUST STOPPED HEATING.....THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT ONE STAR IS BECAUSE OF THE SIZE AND WHEN IT DID HEAT IT WAS NICE.....BUT FOR THE DOZEN TIMES USED IT WAS NOT WORTH BUYING...WILL BE RETURNING IT.
1,No stars here--Defective product indeed,"I wish I'd listened to the other reviews. I bought this and it heated for exactly two months and then quit on me. Claims a five year warranty but I can't return it to Amazon so it's just money wasted.Be smarter than me, avoid this product if you value your money."
1,"Poor value, poor service","This heating pad was received as a gift to replace the Sunbeam heating pad I had used for 35 years and had finally worn out. I was delighted with the larger size, but the new pad did not heat at all. I returned it to HoMedics (along with the $5 handling charge), and two months later they sent a replacement. The replacement heats up, but after one use the pad was hopelessly twisted. It almost looks like it has melted to itself, and it can't be flattened out. I won't be sending this one back with another $5 handling charge--it isn't worth it. This one goes out with the trash, and I go back to Sunbeam."
2,Heating Pad,The large size and multiple settings were great. But product stopped working after just a couple of months.
2,Died after exactly one year of use,"I never really loved this heating pad. The contents within the rubber get twisted easily, it seemed to heat unevenly at times, and towards the end of its life I actually heard little clicking noises coming from it. I got it for Christmas last year, used it a few days after....and then last night it died. No heat, though the light went on.This thing had weekly use on my couch--never left a 5 foot radius. I didn't fold it up, and I never used it with moisture. A year of use is a letdown."
2,Not good for lower backs.,"I bought this for my lower back. I am pregnant now and my back keeps getting achy and goes out from time to time. It is great because it actually wraps all the way around to the back of my hips giving my entire lower back the heat without having to switch it from one side to the other.However, the inner pad bunches up tremendously. I have used it for a few weeks now, and have to take the cover off to ""open"" the pad back up by stretching it out again. It hasn't gone back to the original shape. If I had known it would do this, I would have never purchased it."
3,"Wind mobile 14"" Red Carpet Studio Cosmiix","Dissapointed, need to have polish applied (when new). Looked good in picture but not the quality expected for the price."
1,Not the music I wanted to hear from The Jackal,"I really wish the albums content had actually been that of the music in the film. I mean, you watch the movie, then want to hear the music. I really wish that the score(wonderfully done by Carter Burwell) could be released, or at least included in the current ""soundtrack"". The music was OK, but it didn't contain what I would like to hear when it comes to a movie soundtrack."
2,I found the music score,"For all those who're looking for the music score from the movie by Carter Burwell,[...]Cheers!"
2,WHAT IS THIS RECORD COMPANY TRYING TO PULL?,"I AGREE WITH JOEL FROM ENGLAND. I LIKE ALL TYPES OF MUSIC BUT I EXPECTED A SMOOTHER SOUNDING, MORE CONSISTANT INSTRUMENTAL WHICH WAS IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE MOVIE. I THINK THEY MESSED UP TRYING TO TARGET THE YOUNGER GENERATION FOR THIS SOUNDTRACK INSTEAD OF LEANING TOWARDS THE ADULTS IN THIS CASE. WHAT A SHAME."
4,Great track from a great movie!,One of my favorite movies and favorite soundtracks! Now if I can just get ahold of the score...
5,This soundtrack is the best!!!,"There is a variety of music for everyone. My favorites would have to be Massive Attack and definetly, Red Tape.They have anywhere from heavy metal,(my favorite), to soft and easy.Most of the songs on here were from the movie except a couple. If you have seen the movie and you like the music, this is where to find them.I also recommend the movie to everyone. It is very cool!"
1,WE WANT THE REAL JACKAL SOUNDRACK,"This was the worst soundtrack I've ever heard.The original theme music in the movie was excellent, but it was no where to be heard on this CD. Hey!!.. If anyone knows where to obtain the original theme music (by Carter Burwell), please e-mail me."
2,"Oh, There Is That Trailer Song!","What led me to buy this CD is the song ""Red Tape"" by Agent Provocateur. I was originally looking for the Trailer song to the movie ""Underworld"", because I thought the song and trailer went really cool together. The next thing I know, ""Underworld"" does not have it under their soundtrack and I was given the hint that the movie ""Jackal"" had it. Why, I don't know, maybe some financal reasons with the production company. So, for those who were looking for the ""Underworld"" trailer song, it is here on the ""Music from and Inspired by The Jackal"" CD. The songs are pretty cool if you are into that rave music."
2,The Jackal (Soundtrack),"The ""incidental music"" from ""The Jackal"" is unique and powerful. The main theme that runs throughout the movie is captivating, generating strong emotions in the listener. Unfortunately, the best music from the movie, including the main theme, is not present on the CD - that includes music ""from and inspired by"" the movie.When I ordered the soundtrack to ""The Jackal"", I was hoping to hear the wonderful music of Carter Burwell, who is credited for the music in ""The Jackal"".When will Hollywood stop deciding for listeners/consumers what they think they want to hear, and let us hear what we actually request?"
3,¡There is no real Jackal Original Score CD!,"This CD only had about two songs that were in the movie. That is why i had Amazon change this page from ""The Jackal Soundtrack"" by Carter Burwell to ""Music from and Inspired by The Jackal"" by various artists. There is no original score on the market. Varse Sarabande finally released a legit score of the Predator (1987) 16 years later. I hope a record label would do the same for The Jackal.Other than that fact, the collection has decent music in the tracks of Red Tape and Superpredator. Very high beat and rhythm in Red Tape. The composition of Superpredator on the movie title sequence was appropriate. It was a different theme to expect, but at that a sucessful one."
3,Re: For Those Still Looking for the Massive Attack Song...,"the song which plays while the end credits are rolling (as well as when the jackal is taking a break from things, lounging in his chair, finger tapping to the beat of...) is not called 'shame' but is in fact named ""Dissolved Girl"" which comes off of Massive Attack's 1998 cd Mezzanine.i rated this cd three stars but that was because i had to rate it something in order to post this 'review'. i have never listened to this cd nor do i own it, so i have no opinion of its content. i posted this 'review' because i wanted to respond to the earlier reviewer who inaccurately posted the name of the song."
1,Motor burned out quickly,"I got this kit as a gift about six months ago. During the past six months, I have used it only about five times and the motor burned out! It does say that it comes with a two year limited warranty, but you need a DATED RECEIPT in order to return it. Well, since it was a gift, I guess I'm just out of luck. Consequently, I would not buy this product."
4,Wonderful!,"The only reason that this didn' get 5 stars is because the steamer really does suck. The cleansing brush and all the attachments are great! I had been going to get facials every 2 weeks because I had adult acne. I just couldn't seem to really get my face clean. After I purchased this, the acne went away. All of the attachments make cleaning, moisturizng and microdermabrasion not only fun, but it works!"
1,This product sucked,this product sucked because as soon as we opened the box the sauna was cracked and would not be able to put water into and i didnt get a chance to try the rest of the product because the hand held device wouldnt charge and the best way to steam your face is to get a pot and fill half way with water and let it boil and sitck your face over it also try st. ives apricot scrub its the must have product i would die for it
2,This thing is really dumb,"I was looking forward to a good microdermabrasion treatment. I think I do a lot better with my $3 (for two!) facial scrubbers that I get at Target.The pads on this unit really don't do a good job at all. The suction cups are useless.The brush is okay.The massager attachment (with the rollerballs) doesn't do anything.When buying from Amazon, satisfaction is not guaranteed. So, unless it it broken, it's yours to keep even if it is a lame product."
1,LAND FILL....HoMedics pollutes with junk products that do not work,The product worked briefly and is now LAND FILL. HoMedics creates junk and pollutes by producing and selling fad consumer devices. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY.
1,Great product...WHEN IT WORKED.,I have bought two of these because the cleansing and exfoliation was FABULOUS.Both DIED within 6 months. I am trying to find a comparable product that lasts.Any suggestions?
3,Mixed Results,"I just got my kit in the mail, so I've only used it once so far.The brush attachment is great -- I didn't find it too rough, and it felt like it was really working to clean my skin.The suction attachments didn't do anything at all (other than leaving blotchy pink marks on my skin). Disappointing.The microdermabrasion cream and sponge attachment FELT like it was working...but my skin still doesn't feel particularly smooth (it WAS bad to begin with, though, in the kit's defense).The massager works the way it's supposed to.The mist feature on mine doesn't work AT ALL. I'd consider exchanging it, but from what I've read, several people have had problems with that particular feature, so I doubt that a new one would be any better.If you're buying it for the microdermabrasion and massage, then go for it. It's a pretty cool little kit. Just don't expect all of the features to work well, or you'll be disappointed"
1,Disappointed...,"I'd read good reviews for this item so I got my hopes up. The suction feature doesn't actually remove anything from your pores. It does have quite a bit of suction, so it can irritate your skin, but you can see from the design that even if it did actually remove anything there is no place for the ""stuff"" to go, and no instructions on cleaning ""stuff"" from any part of the unit. The brush definitely scrubbed, but it was coarse enough that I feared that it could be scratching my skin, leaving it vulnerable to more bacteria. The dermabrasion cream was useless with the pads since the abrasive material seems to sink into the sponges and therefore seems to have little effect on my skin.I did like using the dermabrasion cream applying it with my fingers. I'm almost out, though, and I haven't been able to locate a refill for this item..."
3,Short & Sweet,"I've had mine for about 7 months now. I love using the brush tool to deep clean my face, but that's about it. The microdermabrasion tool is okay, but I believe the brush has already done the work by the time you get to this tool. None of the other items were of any benefit and the mister didn't operate at all. The consumables were all acceptable but I prefer using other products. All in all, it takes up very little space on my vanity, I still use the cleaner about twice a week and I can tell the difference when I don't use it. I'd like it better if it was just the brush tool and cost under $20.00."
1,Not Pleased,"I ordered what I thought was a paperback, and what I received was sheet music! I admire Barbra for what she has accomplished in her life. I would have liked to have read the book, for which I assumed was titled after her concert One Voice, which was amazing."
5,Good stuff,"I've been using this for a year now and just love it, I have had no problems no matter what amount I use, but it can be a bit strong tasting if you use more then a light to med sprinkle on foods. I spinkle it on deviled eggs instead of paprika, soooo good! And sprinkle it on tofu, baked potatos, hot rice, Japanese noodles, I've added it to soups, stir frys and will find more ways to use it, I'm sure.If you don't like seaweed don't get it, because thats what it is, so that is what it tastes like!"
2,It's not the same as I had before.,"It's not the same Hawaiian spirulina powder I used to order before. Unlike the Hawaiian spirulina, it has bad smell. Amazon should also change the product's image and change the description on its website immediately."
2,Tastes like a festering pond,"I've had a bit of spirulina in my life and usually love the green flavor it gives to smoothies. This one is not so tasty. Anything I make with it tastes like a festering pond, and is not pleasant to swallow."
3,Tastes and smells horrible,It tastes and smells horrible. But I'll keep drinking it with juice since it's supposed to be good for me.
2,IS THIS StILL Hawaiian ?,"I purchased Now foods spirulina a couple times before and it said right on the container that it was from Hawaii. I just got a 4 LB. size of Now Foods Spirulina and see nothing on the bottle where it's from. Also went to the Now foods site and the description there does not say where it came from. Is this from a new area now ? Anyone know ?UPDATE: June 11, 2012 I just called Now Foods to ask why they do not say Hawaii on the label like it used to. They said because the 4 lb. size of Now foods spirulina I just purchased from Amazon is not from Hawaii and it is in fact from India as they were not able to get from Hawaii. I also asked if it was organic and they said no, What a disappointment as I now have to send it back to Amazon and am going to change the 3 stars to 2 stars. Now Food said they would again get the Hawaii stuff when its available LOL"
1,False Advertising...No Longer comes from Hawaii,"I have been purchasing an average of 4 lbs of thisproduct every other month for many years. Nutrex in Hawaii has been the supplier and the product has always been the very best on the market.I just took delivery on another 4 lb container and it was bitter,sour,and fowl tasting in comparison to what I always received. I called Now Brand to find out what was up. They no longer get their spirulina from Hawai.it comes from India.....this was false advertisingand by far an inferior product. I am sending mine back to Amazon tomorrow. VERY disappointing. Fortunately you can still purchase the real stuff (Nutrex Brand) at Amazon. A bit higher price but by far a superior product. Poor choice of sourcing on behalf of Now Brand."
5,"I take it every day, no problems","I've been taking this for years without problems. I make a protein shake with rice milk, one ounce of spirulina, protein powder, and fiber."
2,This used to be a good brand of spirulina,"They must have recently moved operations to India, because when I bought NOW spirulina before it tasted different and the label said it was from Hawaii. It no longer claims to be from Hawaii, so I doubt its purity. This is a good price if you eat a lot of spirulina, but most people would have trouble just finishing a one-pound bottle. I was able to eat all four pounds, but I will only buy true Hawaiin spirulina from now on because you never know what adulterating substances are put in your food when it comes from India or China."
2,Gels when added to liquid,"I have been using this product for many years. This is the first time I find it is gelling (forms hard lumps, even after hard stirring by spoon). I am wondering if any one else is having the same problem. The details of the batch is :LOT# 1493924 4:10Best used by 7/20/14 2694"
1,Quite disappointing,"Now Foods spirulina had been a staple of my diet, until recently. I do have a level of respect for Now Foods because they generally do provide a solid value for a decent quality product. However, this new batch of spirulina from India is a BIG step backward. I can take some bad tasting supplements, but this is insanely bad tasting. I sent 2 of these Now bottled powders back and ordered the 5 lb Nutrex powder, which is FAR better, but TWICE the price. Hopefully, Now will get the message, if enough people complain."
4,Not the same as Hawaiian spirulina,"After finished my first 4-lb Now Foods spirulina powder, recently I ordered my second jar and boy, they are different; the second jar comes with a rotten/sewage smell and it tasts just as bad. The after taste stays in my mouth for a long time too. I force myself to drink this stuff down while holding my breath. when I called their customer service, I was told that they recently changed the supplier from Hawaii to someplace in India. In my mind the first jar tastes the same as the one from Nutrex Hawaiian Spirulina, so that confirms the difference in tastes between the two places. I have not gotten sick yet, I plan to finish this jar and order from Nutrex next time."
1,Spirulina...,"I had to return the product after one try. The fact is that you can get everything in this supplement from a very good diet. Do not believe when people tell you that it tastes great. This product smells like rotten eggs and the taste is horrible as well. The B12 in Spirulina is very questionable according to some studies. There are different producers of Spirulina and the best are produced in an organic form in India and non organic in Hawaii. Spirulina powder is in a natural form, it is not a byproduct of another product and research shows that powder is more effective than tablets since it is the raw product. Buy the tablets otherwise I can assure you, unless you are not dedicated or do not have an excellent reason, no way in the world you will tolerate the smell of it at all less alone the rotten taste of it. To get the same affects as one table spoon of powder you will need to take probably over 10 tablets."
3,Too much solo-work talk,"There are a few items that are gems in here, but most of it is boring because all the interviewer asked about were John and Yoko's solo work! Ugh. I like some of their solo work, but I'm a Beatles fan. It was John who volunteered the Beatles bits in this interview, and I was hoping the interviewer would encourage him to expand on that. But he'd then ask, ""So, when you and Yoko were in the bag in Vienna...."" Frustrating. I probably would have given this book two stars, but there is added poignancy here, because John was murdered only hours after he gave it. And he is so enthusiastic about so much in this interview, it adds to the tragedy that a person with so much enthusiasm, with so much creativity left to explore, couldn't live to fulfill it (more than he did already). His loss...and ours...."
2,A decent NIC if the one you get actually works.,"The NetGear FA312 network interface card works nicely as long as you don't get a defective one. I've bought a total of seven. One just didn't work, another would only connect at 10 Mbps (actually, that one didn't work either), and another one had the (infamous) ""wrong PCI signature"" problem. NetGear claims that you can work around this problem, but you can't if you want to install two NICs in your computer and one of them has the problem. Anyway...the ones that work, work perfectly fine. If you buy one of these cards, you'd better be prepared to send it back until you get one that works. You can't beat the price though, so I give it 2 stars."
1,Netgear Warranty [isn't good],"After 6 month operating the FA312 card, the card suddenly burned and the system won't power-up until i removed it. After calling the technical support, the response that i get is that Netgear's warranty doesn't cover a card that gets burned. Even though I and an UPS and tried to install it on different system and different motherboard, the tech support kept asking for more, like ""go to your neighbor and install it in his system"". Like who would let you install a card that can mess-up their system.My best advice is to STAY AWAY FROM NETGEAR AND THEIR ""WARRANTY"" that doesn't cover anything."
3,A great movie for a young audience,"I'm 19, and I love the Tenchi series. In my opinion, this is a poorly done Tenchi movie, and by a poorly done Tenchi movie, I mean a very good regular film. The movie is excellent up to a point, with lots of humor and tons of character development, especially with Ryoko (my favorite character). My only real problem with the film is that it gets really cheesy near the end. This isn't really a problem for younger audiences, and it doesn't take away much from the movie; it just makes the movie seem a bit more like a Disney film than I hoped for. In general, the movie doesn't reach the level of the first film, but it's definitely worth buying for Tenchi fans and lovers of the holidays."
4,Tenchi's a father!,"I would strongly recommend that you have at least seen Tenchi Universe before you watch this as some of the information in the series will be needed to understand the plot.The story is that one day a young girl with blue hair shows up and starts calling Tenchi ""daddy"".Ayeka and Ryoko are both shocked by this and Ryoko trys to kill her.The animation is brillant all the way through.The story has much more action than the first movie and is in my opinion better because of this.I can't wait to see Tenchi Forever!:)"
2,hmmmmmm Not exactly what I was looking for,"Well, this is what I call an ""Interesting manga"" slightly strange and had nothing to do with the Usual tenchi and gang so that cheezed me off a little bit. It's about this girl, thing a mijig who beileves she is Tenchi's daughter, like i said strange. If you're really into tenchi stuff that follows the story you might want to try something different. But if your're into strange blue haired girls and evil gigantic stuffed animals you might like this."
2,Pass this one up,I own this one. I bought the first and second Tenchi Muyo movies and a friend gave me the third one. So I have seen all the movies. I have to say that Tenchi Forever is the best one in the series!This particular movie didn't really make much sense to me. It got completely off the track of what Tenchi is really about. I would say pass on this one. Watch Tenchi Forever the last in the series because it is the most relevant for any Tenchi fan. I give this two stars just because at least Tenchi and all the gang were in it.
2,"Umm...just rent this one, if you really need to",I don't think this was as good as the first movie. You can tell it's made by the Tenchi in Tokyo writers because the story is well...BAD! Do what I'd do if I were you and rent this first and see if you like it. Maybe you'll like it and maybe not.
5,Cast list offered is for the movie Manatsu No Eve,"The cast list for Tenchi Muyo 2: Here Comes Ayeka, is actually the cast list for the movie Manatsu No Eve, known in the US as Tenchi Muyo Movie 2: Daughter of Darkness. Fix this, and I will return to review it. I've seen the whole Tenchi series, and would love to review them episode by episode, so get to work on it. :-)"
5,Tenchi The movie 2 Daughter of Darkness,"This animated movie is the second feature-length adventure of Tenchi, the teenage hero of a popular Japanese television program. In this sequel, Tenchi is tending to his family's cemetery plot when a girl shows up and insists that she is his daughter. When a DNA test proves the girl is telling the truth, Tenchi and his friends are baffled; meanwhile, a mysterious being from the Dimension of Darkness hides in waiting.If there is one anime movie to watch this is it."
4,Loved it but too short,"I loved the new character Mayuka she was a breathe of fresh air giving Royko something else to be jealous of other than Ayeka. The problem is the film was only 60 minutes long which is extremly short even for a tenchi movie ai the other two were 95 minutes long. It is also rather confusing how the first and third tenchi movie have obvious ties to the universe series and yet this one is definately more tied to the OVA. Sasami makes mention of the fact that when she grows up she will be like Tsunami. Some people might say well what about Kiyone, well truth is she was introduced in the Miohshi special which for whatever reason never made it to the DVD. Also when tenchi transforms into his Juri warrior aspect that is similar to the OVA not the universe. I really hope this means that my new favorite character will make her apperance when they finish the OVA. Rumor has it that the work is still in progress."
4,Great . . . . Almost,"This movie was pretty good. It has an intersting story, a girl that is supposedly Tenchi's daughter shows up and wreaks havoc on Ryoko and Ayeka. It has the action and comedy that Tenchi Muyo normally has, but it wasn't perfect.The first one is better. This movie starts okay, but gets a bit boring toward the end. It finally picks up at the very end, with the fight.It is too short. Only one hour long. Washu pobably doesn't get as much screen time in this movie as she does in the first one, but the movie is so short, she seems to have a much bigger part.Some scenes made no sense at all. It seems like Myuka (the daughter) has to kiss, or lick, Tenchi to bring him to the dark world where her creator, Yuzuha, tries to take out her anger with Yosho on Tenchi. It's all weird, and why Yuzuha would choose that act to bring Tenchi to her I cannot figure out.Some other small annoying bits are Washu's ugly clothes, Tenchi's sudden case of patheticness, and Mihoshi."
4,Cute movie,"I actually watched it in english, and Mayuka's voice wasn't that bad. I would recommend it over the other 2 movies because it has a more interesting plot. Mayuka's cute...except for that hairstyle...too Miaka/Usagi-like. And when she kissed Tenchi...that was just weird. But other than that, it was a good movie, but it would be better for a mature audience."
4,Daughter of Darkness,"Well Let's just say that it is a very very fast moving movie. They don't really take there time in scenes and it is kinda hard to keep track. I would strongly recomend renting before buying. It was cute in parts but had confusing parts. I would only recomend this to a true fan. I was also disapointed a little how they twisted the characters. Ryoko and Aeka did not fight at all. Aeka was actually not much how you would expect and she hardly even played a role. Really Ryoko,Tenchi, and his so called daughter of Darkness were it."
4,"Short, but Sweet!","The story is a bit short, but its truly wonderful, and worth watching. And for DVD, it comes with an awesome Tenchi Encyclopedia, as well as sub-title. You can also hear it in Japanese, for all you Japanese learners out there!"
5,Both Sub and Dub Are Awesome: a Must for Tenchi Lovers,"I saw both the subtitled and dubbed version of this movie, and they were both VERY good. The story is about a girl, Mayuka, who comes from the future claiming to be Tenchi's daughter. Of course the whole household is upset by this, Ryoko especially. The main villian was Yuzuha, a demon from Grandfather's past on Jurrai. If you enjoy Tenchi, you have to get this. The animation is top quality. The dubbing is good, although a few voices were recast. And the subtitled version gives you the original feeling of the movie, with easy reading. (And only one mistake through the whole hour!) This was a truly great movie, and a must for anime lovers! Also, if you've seen the movie and enjoyed it, you might be interested in getting the soundtrack for it, which is also available and is very good too."
4,Not as good as the first but it was very sweet and charming!,"This is a very good movie for Tenchi fans and for people who don't know the storyline can follow this plot line easy. It's about a girl who comes along the road and comes up to Tenchi and claims that she is Tenchi's daughter he brings her to his home because he doesn't know what to do about it. But Ryoko,Ayeka,Sasami and Mihoshi are all going nuts about wondering who could be the girl's mother? Well, who could be the girl's mother?"
2,What a pain!,"I purchased this item elsewhere and had a heck of a time with it. If you use all four bars, it's too tall. If you use only three, it's too short (this is going from tub to ceiling, not floor to ceiling). Then to top it off, it started rusting within 3 days. Shouldn't something that's made for the tub be rust-proof???The only good thing about it is it does what it's supposed to do, it holds bath accessories. Once I got it in the shower, that is. Since the 4th bar made the pole too tall, I had to place it in the tub with just the three bars and bunch up hand towels under the bottom of it to hold it in place."
2,not sturdy,this looks like the picture but it is'nt very sturdy. unless you can find a way to glue it to the tiles in the shower. shipping was very prompt from amazon.
2,Flimsy by comparison to the one it replaced.,"It works, but was priced about the same as the one we had purchased a few years back and this one isn't nearly as nice. Very flimsy, but still functional."
4,Shower help,"This shower caddy is everything the retailer's description said it would be. It installs firmly without too much labor or headache, and looks very nice. My only complaint is that the shelves were a wee bit shaky, but a bit of Gorilla Glue took care of that. Other reviews spoke of rust or tarnishing but our experience is only shiny!"
3,4 shelf tension pole,"Thought this ""four shelf tension pole"" would be a bit stronger and bigger than it really is. The baskets are not level. This pole is replacing one which got rusty after about 5 years use...the old one was a better one and much cheaper."
1,Terrible Story,"I read many of the reviews here before I bought this book so I thought I knew what to expect... but the story just doesn't make much sense. The first chapter is intensely boring. The second and third chapters seem to have interesting stories that abruptly end. Of course these small stories (ten in all) are what are supposed to tie the main characters together. But what they mainly serve to do, as the author takes elements from these individual stories, is to create a confusing story that is heavily laced with philosophical thoughts and a limited amount of dry boring dialog. At page 200 I honestly still had not much clue what was going on in this book. I don't recommend this book to anyone."
2,Terrible,"Well, to be honest the only reason that I purchased this book in the first place was for a class that I was taken so I know that this review will be very biased. First of all, I found Calvino's writing style to be very hard to follow. This book did not keep my attention at all and I did not even finish it."
4,Reading this book is like peeling an onion...,"there are so many layers to it. Each chapter is a new novel, and each novel is intriguing in itself, though they all hang together beautifully in comprising the final product. If you've never read Calvino, this is a very good book to start with."
2,By page 50 I was bored,"I have read a moderate amount of experimental/post-modern fiction, and I have enjoyed a fair amount of it. However, I could not get into this book. Calvino certainly demonstrated an aptitude for writing in many different styles; I just wish he did more with it. This book was a collection of unfinished genre exercises tied together with a narative questioning authorship and authenticity. These are interesting topics, but they have been explored elsewhere in ways that I found more interesting."
2,I could not wait to finish it,"I bought this book with high expectations (a bit like 'the reader', no doubt), but they were dashed by the end of the first chapter. As the page numbers increased, so did the absurdity. Some of the 'novels within' were of interest but the whole was not very satisfying. I would recommend virtually every book I have read in the last 8 or so years before this one."
3,"All style, no substance","After I read the first 50 pages, I thought to myself that this was the most brilliant thing I had ever read. But then when I was about half way through the book, the gimmick had worn really thin and I had to struggle to finish the book upon realizing (without giving anything away) that (a) it's kind of pointless to read the titled chapters, and (b) the story told in the numbered chapters has stopped making sense."
1,On the subject of bad books...,"I am reading this book right now for a class, and it is just plain and simple a terrible book. Calvino takes an extremely patronizing tone throughout and expects you to follow him into his aimless gab and gibberish of a ""novel"". It completely lacks a plot or thorough characterizations and yet expects you to connect with the people that come and go about you. I understand that his purpose is to iterate the joys and difficulties of reading, yet it completely misfires. It does not attempt to connect with the reader, instead it only lectures to you, and therefore makes it completely devoid of use. It was an utter waste of my time when I could have been reading Dostoyevsky."
2,Too little plot; too many gimmicks,"Well, this is one of the more inventive books I've ever read. It was difficult to plod through, however, I continued with the hope of a great reward at the end. The reward was small.For awhile I was being pulled along by curiosity. After a few chapters I grew tired of the ""game"" and just had to try to keep myself from getting distracted so I could finish the book. I'm glad I actually reached the end, but I'm not sure it was worth the effort.I realize that more scholarly types think this book is spectacular. I'm just an ordinary reader and I found it unenjoyable."
5,"FABULOUS, MAGICAL","Calvino can be hit or miss. You either love him or hate him. This book is truly one of his best. It is an interactive novel where the reader becomes one of the characters. If you have a strong need for resolution and don't like stories left to your imagination, don't read this book; you will be frustrated and disappointed. If you are a ""traveler"" in the sense where you have visited many places without leaving your home, if you enjoy the magical realism of Borges and Marquez, this book will thrill you and take you on a thought provoking ride."
2,snoozer,We read this book for my book club. No one liked it except the one person who recommended it. Its just too strange.
3,If on a winter's night a traveler... Review,"This was the first Italo Calvino novel that I read, and I partly wish that I would have started with anoter one of his books. While I enjoyed the book, the pace seemed to drag at times and could get haphazard and easily displace a reader. The ending did tie up the lose ends, but I felt that it could have taken a more direct approach.I enjoyed the book being written in the second-person, as it brought you into the book as a protaganist, and by in certain parts I almost wished that I were reading the novel that was being read by you (the Reader) rather than the book that I had in my hands."
3,Great Idea But Didn't Quite Work For Me,"This was a strange read for me. I loved the idea of the novel, and I really enjoyed the first half. It was very interesting to read these small snippets of different books, and I liked the absurd way the search for the rest of one book lead to the beginning of another. The problem for me was the second half, and the introduction of a weird semi-plot. It was completely uninteresting to me, and served to bog down the novel. I really wish Calvino had stuck to what seemed to be the original premise; a kind of post-modern anti-novel, with no plot, exploring vastly different styles and themes, delighting readers with the very things which should frustrate."
2,Rating for Kindle version only,"I love this book so this rating is only for the Kindle version, which abounds with misspellings due to scanning and no editing before publishing. I enjoy my Kindle but find the lack of attention paid to the electronic books by publishers frustrating."
3,Not exactly a conventional narrative!,"I must confess to having found this book very difficult. Calvino satirises a number of different narrative styles, and continually shifts the ground from beneath the reader's feet. It is certainly very clever, but the point frankly eluded me. It is not that I necessarily look for a conventional narrative; but I do look for a particular authorial vision. I'm afraid I didn't see anything more in this book than a bag of tricks. It was all very amusing, but I distinctly got the impression I was missing something. My loss, no doubt!"
2,"Oy, the number of logs you could saw with this book....","However novel (ha, ha) the ideas herein; however vast the breadth (or girth) of Calvino's erudition; however numerous the styles (to their varying degress of success) of literary ""satire"" (if it can indeed be called that), this just made my eyes hurt. Not to be daunted by a little book, I eked my way through it, and met with the glorious reward of a splitting headache... I've read most of Calvino, enjoyed most of it thoroughly (esp. Baron o' the Trees and Invisible Cities), but Winter's Night reminded me most of the high you get after snorting tepid oatmeal: (a) lumpily suffocating and (b) thoroughly unsatisfying (DISCLAIMER: don't try this at home or without proper adult supervision, kiddies). I'll take a tall postModernist blonde over this malarkey-in-translation any day of the week."
2,"Cute idea, boring read","Yes the idea of this novel is cute, but as with many ideas it ends up failing in execution. Simply this book is a tiresome bore to read (probably the longest 300 pages I ever had to endure). And no it is not just because it was totally devoid of plot; it was also void of energy, passion, excitement etc. This is a book that is fun to hear about but not fun to read. I do give credit to Calvino for his originality, but really a writer needs more than mere originality to stand on."
4,"clever, convoluted, exasperating","If on a Winter's Night can be read forwards, backwards, any way at all. Each chapter/installment contains a wealth of insight and opinion about writing and the writerly. As literature, the plot is, well, implausible and the story peters out at the end. Though a must-read, it is not for a mere pleasure-seeker"
3,joe walsh-what a waste of songs,great selection of songs. but alot of the sound quality was bad. until it got to the confesser. part of it was mastered and the other was done digitally.
1,Problems are BIG,"Where is Problems at ? Think Ill stick with the Confessor than with this slapped together, not thought out, what can I get rights to rip off."
2,Great Selection but Poor Recording,The album has a great selection of Joe's popular songs but the guitar tracks are muted and almost undectable. I grew up with these songs and for me the lead guitar is critical. I checked other MP3 sites and they all have the same version distibuted by the record company-shame on them! Remaster the songs and put the lead guitar back.
5,Fantastic collection!,"It's Joe Walsh! The greatest hits record is awesome, song by song, from The James Gang through his storied solo career."
5,what a great CD!,This is a really great CD for the Joe Walsh fan. It has all the great guitar playing he is known for and great lyrics to go along with it. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes great music.
5,Joe Walsh is the best Guitarist alive,"Although I think Angus Young of AC/DC is one of the best guitarist of all time, I like Joe Walsh better. To me Joe Walsh combines his talented vocals and guitar playing ability to create some of the best music in 70s Rock. He truely in ""Life's Been Good"" proves to be ""the best guitarist of all time"". If you want just a taste of Joe Walsh, get this cd and he'll prove to you that he's more than what you thought, and leave you wantin more than just a taste. He rocks hard. Long live the greatest guitarist the Eagles ever had."
5,Great cross-section of Joe Walsh's work,"This is an excellent album choice for determining whether you need more Joe Walsh, and if so what portions of his career you would like to collect further. ""The Bomber"" and ""Mother Says"" are great choices to expose you to what early Joe Walsh sounded like outside of the hits. I would have dropped ""The Confessor"" and gone with ""Class of '65"", and I would have also included my favorite song by Joe, ""County Fair"". But that's nit picking. If I had to list 15 songs to represent his music, I'm sure it would look a lot like this album."
2,Not a good guide,"I have read six other Culture Shock books. Those are interesting and well researched. However, Culture Shock USA is the opposite. It deals far more with everyday life, than with the USA, with knowing little about what aspects of American life would be a problem or a surprise to a foreigner (apparently most Americans wouldn't know). I have read a few other interesting and well researched books about the USA, e.g.Coping with Americaby Peter Trudgill, which I would recommend instead."
4,Some of this books is very true,"I think the two parts I found most sad, and yet very true are about how 'friendly' you will find Americans. They will talk to you (a stranger) about many intimate details on a line waiting for a bus, or at the doctor's office, or anywhere but do not assume that means 'they want to be friends.' People will do the 'hey how you doing?' greeting and talk with you and even if they WERE friends, don't expect to ever hear from them again.They will say ""let's get together"" or ""I'll call you soon"" and you will never hear from them again.The other sad part is how lonely Americans are, deep down. We can be all bluff and blunder and buddy buddy. Yet so many of us sit home alone and wish we had some friends. It only gets worse as you get older.As an American, the nicest people I have met in the USA have been foreigners."
1,Liberal intellectual's viewpoint on the US.,"The book is supposed to inform the newcomer, instead it's just full of generalizations as the author simply cannot keep herself from injecting her biases into some of the most important aspects of American lifestyle.For example, she mentions on crime that there are many guns ""floating"" around because ""anyone can just walk into a store a buy a gun"". However according to the author this is really because some zealots insist on intepreting the constitution the wrong way and if the founding fathers were around they'd find handguns as crazy as most foreigners do.Written by a liberal 'intellectual' that feels Christians and conservatives are fundamentalists and not that enlightened. I would think an impartial and honest book on culture clash would focus on the differences between the US and abroad without having the need to comment on policies."
5,Garlic Jr. is stupid,"Well at last FUNimation is relasing new episodes an on May 16 the Trunks saga will hit the video shelves.In my personal opinion I hate Garlic Jr. I have Dead Zone in DVD only becuse it was the first DBZ movie.I love DBZ ,and if you want a really good movie or saga ,get the BUU saga ,the Cell saga and movies 7,8,12and 13.Available only in Japanese. DRAGON FIST"
4,Action Packed As Usual,"If you love the action in all of the DBZ episodes, you'll love this video. It's just as great as all DBZ! The fights are really great, and there are those little weird comedy segments that always leave you going ""Uh, what?"" All in all, it's really cool."
3,Okay Video,"This was an okay video. The Garlic Jr. Saga really didn't help the stoy, but it did have alot of action. So really you should only buy this if you just want to see all the episodes."
3,THE DEAD ZONE,I really liked The world Awakens it had really good animation and action but the other 2 episodes weren't as good.I have only seen it cut so if you buy this go for uncut.
1,Don't buy this item. Beware of Seller- Clearly Superior Technologies.,I had to click a star to write this review. This seller and product rate 0 star. I am glad to see this item is no longer available on Amazon and I hope it stays that way. The MACTRAC Deluxe is a piece of junk. It comes with a FLOPPY DISC!!! for installation. A FLOPPY DISC! My MAC guy couldn't even get the thing to work. Amazon you need to be more careful and scrutinize your sellers and their products with more care.
4,Professional Artist,"I had the delight of receiveing this CD along with others for my review in Planet Lightworker Magazine and found it absolutely delightful. Intricate piano melodies weave a spell that is as nice to simply listen to as it is to use for body work, Reiki, Massage, or Yoga.Definately a professional artist, Ms. Seits has put a lot of work and love into these pieces, and it shows. Bravo!"
3,Inexpensive but a bit flimsy,"These cases have a very good mechanism for their hold/release pushbutton for the discs (some products are very poor for this, either too hard to remove, or not firm enough so the disc falls off). However the plastic of the case is on the thin side, making the case flexible and not too sturdy. The price is very good."
3,It was ok I guess...,"I purchased this to clean my wedding ring but I was not happy with the amount of the cleaning solution I received. It was only a little packet and I thought a jar of cleaning solution came with it. Especially the fact that the directions states to only use their brand of cleaning solution. My ring did sparkle but a couple of weeks later I cleaned my ring with a toothbrush and baking soda toothpaste and got the same results. Hmmmm, toothpaste would be a more economical option had I known earlier."
4,Nice and Small,I really haven't used this yet but can say I bought it to replace a larger cleaner that I had owned. My sister had the smaller one and really loved it. I myself like the small size and I think for it to last it will have to be cleaned well after each use.
1,I got this product based on the excellent reviews,I got this product and the soap that goes with it. When I take my jewelry out of the cleaner it has this soapy film and I need to rinse it for hours. My jewelry doesn't look clean. In fact I can still see dirt and grime under the gems. I think a regular toothbrush and clear dish soap is a better cleaner. I would never recommend this product to anyone.
2,Falls apart,"I've had this jewelry cleaner for about five months. So far, one of the battery covers has broken (I've taped it back together) and one side of the power switch has broken off. It cleans jewelry well, but it does hold up well to a lot of use. I clean my wedding rings about once a week, just to give you an idea of how much use it has received."
3,"Appropriate for older children, not toddlers","If you've already read books on helping your child sleep, this book won't tell you anything new, mainly that you need to establish a nightly bedtime routine and stick to it. It does, however, give you some options to help reinforce the bedtime routine, including a ""bedtime contract"" and a ""bedtime hour chart"".If this is the first book you've read on sleep problems in children, it will be helpful to you if your child is old enough to read.Unfortunately, though the books says it's ""Appropriate for parents of children ages 2-12"", I don't think my two-year-old can understand the concept of a contract, or what a ""nightly hygiene routine"" is.Also, this book views co-sleeping as a ""bad habit"", so if you're an advocate of attachment parenting, this book's not for you."
1,Good... at first.,"This VCR was great at first but after about 4 months I started having problems. It stopped playing my old vhs tapes. Now it won't play anything it dosen't even eject the tape it just flashes a green light, in which you have to turn the VCR off then back on, wait about 30 to 40 seconds before attempting to play the vhs again. This becomes so frustrating after the 5th or 6th time I don't even feel like watching the movie anymore. Just stay clear."
3,"A bit tacky, but my son likes it","The quality is not that great, but it holds true to the bible. There are not frills and deviations from the actual bible stories, so I would suggest it to anyone who would like to teach thoir kids (ages 4-8) about stories in the bible in an illustrated way. Also get Vol 1."
2,whole new level of suck,"i like dillon fence and all, used to listen to em back in high school, enjoyed a good amount of their songs. but man oh man....this recording should never have been released. the sound quality is horrid. greg was singing flat over 1/2 the time...the drummer sounded like he hadn't played a drumset in years! the guitars were way too distorted, u couldn't make out the melodies/harmonies. total trainwreck. yeah i know its a live show but man i really would have had to leave after a few songs, it really is just that bad. i personally cannot recommend this to anyone! ugh!"
2,stupid,i think space ghost needs to get a life and before he writes in again should learn how to spell are you a hick from the south or what?
4,"Fine story, poor editing.","Book entertaining, well written, and with a clever and engrossing story line. Excellent description of occupying British troops, political views of the day for both sides, and good work on the personal aspects. Only problem is one that can be corrected with good editing. That is punctuation. This book is sadly lacking in good editing.Example: ""How are you Abigail?"" No comma before the proper name. This occurs steadily throughout the book, as well as other poor editing examples, detracting from what should have been a 5 star read!!!!!!!"
4,Cute little tale,"It's a cute little tale that's appropriate for virtually any age, whether you're a Mom reading it to your near-asleep child, or a guy giving it to your girlfriend. Check it out."
5,Best idea for valentines!!,Guys truly show how you feel about your girl with this little book. Promise great things will happen after you read her this sweet little story about love.
4,"Great, bawdy fun","This keenly observed account of humans in and out of lust (and, occasionally, love) is timeless and wonderful. Through the storytelling by courtesans and procuresses one watches Aretino weave a tapestry of human scheming and gender battles that is as fresh today as it was nearly 500 years ago when it was penned. It is amazing to reflect as one reads this book, which is entirely and quite convincingly narrated by women, that it was written by a man. Aretino had a penetrating (no pun intended) and deeply humane insight that glows through these witty pages. It is said that he influenced de Sade and one can detect that influence in the works of the much more famous rake who lived over 200 years later. In brilliance and originality, however, Aretino eclipses de Sade who was fixated on shock value.On a practical note, I recommend skimming part one since it is a tad weak and then reading parts two and three entirely."
3,Tae Bo amped,"I would not recommend purchasing this product without the amplifier bar. This DVD is definitely designed to go with the bar. It also is focused on the upper body, not so much buns and thighs."
4,A Real Challenge!,"I got this workout after watching an infomercial for it late one night (I usually NEVER order from infomercials, but I'm a Billy Blanks fan). Just received it Friday, and did the Fat Burn Accelerator and the Core Express, and I LOVE them! Like another person rating this, my bar seems like it doesn't lock right on one side, so I'm gonna call on Tuesday and see if I can get another one. Overall, GREAT!!!"
1,Used Condition - Did Not Have the Amped Bar,The picture shows the amped bar. Some sellers are only selling the CD's. Read carefully because the picture is misleading. I got a refund because the amped bar was missing. I'll wait to buy new next time.
2,Not Happy,I was hoping that these dvds were gonna be good but I guess not......... one of them even stops in the middle of the workout because they run outta time and then they are off count with each other and not all doing the same things @ the same time
3,Not as described...,"The seller really needs to change the description on here because you don't get seven dvd's as stated. You only get the basic five. When I contacted Amazon they did give me a five dollar credit, but I didn't get the two extra dvds I was told I was getting and those two dvds were the main reason I went with this seller so beware!"
1,Doesn't Hit A Mark Anywhere...,"Maybe this album/artist is just trying to do too much in too many areas, but I felt this CD just didn't hit gold anywhere. A tribute to the Funkadelic 70's? I don't think so, the energy just isn't there. More like Sunday morning mood music, if you ask me (and you did, that's why you are reading this review!). There is just too much outstanding old school funk out there to waste your time listening to this. Maybe if you are looking for some acid house music with a slight pinch of 70's funk, but if you are shooting for something along the lines of Bootsy, go elsewhere..."
4,Disappointing,"I loved the SNES and N64 versions. My friends & I played them hundreds of hours, especially the battle modes.While this is still better than other Kart games, this is the weakest. There are only a few good race tracks & others are just boring. The battle mode stages are a HUGE disappointed. I had so much with 2-player battles in the SNES version and a lot of fun with 4-player in the N64. There's only 1 stage that's good for battle in this one. The others are terrible. Very little thought went into it. WHY? Battle is one of the best parts of the series. They RUINED battle mode. And I agree, winning the Star Cup in 150CC comes down to luck, not skill. You will be frustrated at the 150cc, it's ridculous and unfair."
4,Mario is king of the Karts,"Mario Kart: Double Dash has been a long awaited game ever since the nintendo gamecube came out. If you love Mario Kart for the nintendo 64 then you will deffinatly love this game. Great graphics, smooth game play, and tons of caharcters and courses. This will also be on of the best multiplayer games out on the market. If you haven't yet, you should deffinitly pick up yourself a copy of this game. It is Mario all the way baby!"
3,"Decent, but overblown","First of all I have to say that when I first got the game, I thought it was awesome. I don't normally read manuals unless the game is totally new to me. However, I soon noticed that this game is NOT the greatest racing game. First, the tracks just aren't as interesting as Mario Kart 64. There are less shortcuts, less strategy. All you need are items in this game. That's it. Plus, there really aren't any secrets in thiw game. In Mario Kart 64, there were lots of shortcuts, the ability to jump (over bananas), and the ability to make the banana to nothing to you (character whistles). If you have a lot of extra cash, then you may want to get this game. However, if you are a real hardcore gamer, you may want to spend your money on something else."
3,gets boring,after 3 hours at least it gets boring.RENT IT FIRST.great for kid 6 and older i would say.i like the new 2 charecter thing but otherwise not the best racing game by a long shot.
5,Simply amazing...,"I bought this game a couple of days ago and I can't stop playing...I love the beatiful graphics and I love the character selection. I highly reccomend it to any person of any age. The multi-player is also very fun if you have friends that come over a lot. I do not really reccomend this game to someone that is looking for a 1-player game. If you are looking for a 1-player game, stay away from this and get Prince of Persia...but If you like multi-player games, get this..."
5,Great Game!,My (...) son loves this game and plays it constantly. He enjoys both the racing and battle levels and unlocks new levels by winning races. It's a lot of fun and a great buy.
5,Great game!,"Loved this game from the start. Love the teams-- it was a refreshing change to the Kart franchise. It took me some time to learn the controls and figure out how best to control my karts, but with practice it has come quite smoothly.Love the unlockables! With every accomplishment came a prize... better than a trophy! A new character, or a new car, or a new level! Great-- lots of fun.I admit I got frustrated a lot with 150, and even more so with mirror mode, and the all cup races, but the game is now beat, and I still play it regularly! Lots of fun. Highly recommended."
5,One of the best games ever made,Dear mario kart fans. First I would like to say this is one of the best games ever made. I was a little hesitant about this game when I first heard about it. I loved mario kart64 and I thought that the programmers at nintendo could not match mario kart64. I was totally wrong. This is the best mario kart that nintendo has come out with. I beat the game in a two weeks. But the point of the game is not to beat it. The point of the game is the multi player action. All the roommates in the house play the game and we just love it. We are always playing the game and trying to beat each other. Mario kart double dash is a shrine in the house. We always have visitors over at the house that have never played. After they play in our house they are hooked. Use this game as a multi-player game and have fun.
3,Slapped,"The reason they had two people in the car is so they could make out.Yep. Uh huh. Even mario and luigi.Ok here it goes. first off the hary guy punched midget marry and then rode a see-say and wistled yankee doodle with a pogo stick. then Avril Lavine Whoopie Goleburg and Pooh bear broke up their band called ""the random science fairs"" thats why they made the eye tow so mario kart double dash could be better than mario kart 64. Yep. uh huh. double is better than 64."
4,Horrible,"Thiis game was horrible, it took almost an hour to download evrything and it kept freezing while i was playing. Glitches are always accuring and you never actual play. I deffinetly do not recommend this game to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Best Game for a Family,This is the best game that we have played in a while. It allows us as a family of four to play all together and it's just so much fun!
4,amazing graphics compared to mario kart 64,"i started playing this game and loved it immediately it just has amazing graphics and just had plain great graphics compared to mario kart 64.The two players on a kart is awesome,the battles are awesome, (there are 3 ways of battling bob-omb, ballon,and steal the shrine battles)and i just love how there are so many characters to choose from.and if ur bumed out because they dont have toad...dont worry!u unlock him by winning grand prixs.my names alex lambert im 11 and love this game!"
4,It was cool,I really liked this game but don't get it for the multiplayer because that part gets boring really fast.
5,Excellent Playing Time,"I purchased this game for my daughter for Christmas. As it turned out, my husband and I had put more time into than she did. We were gold cup champions for every race and at every race a new prize was unlocked. The ""weapons"" were great. The red hooming shell that would follow the opponent until it made contact and the fabulous blue shells, we called them first place flyers, were always a big hit."
1,A dissapointment,"Most of the reviews I read for this game were all raves. However, it is my experience that they took the things out that were best about mario cart. Example: red shells do not hit the sides anymore, as long as you shoot them they will hit their target. This allows no skill or restraint for using them and just tend to be cheap altogether. Also, the idea that you drop your items when you spin out also proves to be very frustrating. But the main point is that this game is not worth the money that is required for you to put up for it."
2,not what i expected,"I liked Mario Kart. I LOVED Mario Kart 64!! and had great hopes for this one. only to be somewhat disappointed. it looks great, sounds like mario kart, and is all very familer. but the gameplay is sub-par. The kart control is non existent, the double team is nothing, and the weapons are littered everywhere, making it fustrating as ...! it involves very very little racing and lots of luck. battle mode is lame too. the most annoying thing is then inability to 'hop', i wish they would have left some of the old control in this title. and left out lots of the obstacles. fun, but not the best Kart."
3,naah,"To be honest double dash didnt live up to be what i excpected. I thought it would be as fun as super circuit or the one for nitendo 64.It is kinda of easy to beat. I dont know why but i miss the jump and then do the drift turn thing, or just the jumping. There were no new weapons. To really have fun with this game you ned at least 2 people. When you play by yourself you cant do the whole switch thing really and you cant punch with just one player. Battle isnt much fun either. You wont play it that much. double dash just isnt like its family. The games before it. Another thing king boo.there are light medium and heavy people. King boo is part of heavy somehow. He's a friggin ghost and he's heavy. He doesnt even touch the car, he just floats."
3,"Not bad, but not very deep","What's not so great: Our last 'cart game being ""Crash Team Racing"" for PS1, so I was expecting more battle arenas. There are only 3 and no customizing. If you know the track you win, if you don't you lose - it discourages friends from playing as there's no way to handicap. Battling other racers adds some element of chance, but not much - if you get far ahead you usually win. Finally, shortcuts are lame.What's good: Graphics are sharp (and candy-color BRIGHT), driving/handeling/throwing is spot on! The more people playing the better this game gets (assuming they've played it before). The Duo mode is intresting, but it actually makes racing harder.What looks like a great game at the start soon runs out of new stuff to do (compaired to ""SSX3"" which seems to last forever)."
5,I loved it,My son loves any Mario. This was one of his christmas presents. I am done. Thank you Mario much love
1,well,"I hate to write a bad review and put a stain on someone. this is the deal, the item was not working, seller mentioned minor scratches but that it was functional(which was not the case and wonder if it was even tested before shipping). when I contacted seller they offer refund but I had to ship it back to them out of my own pocket. we cannot ignore that product could have been damaged during shipment, however the case it was shipped on had no damage or signs of being mistreated. the shipment did arrive on time."
5,Awesome racing game,"Mario Kart: Double Dash!! is a great addition to the kart racing genre, as the sequel to one of the best selling racing games. Nintendo isn't letting us down, with 16 different tracks, 20 characters, and 21 different karts to drive. Although Double Dash is different from all the other Mario Kart games, allowing 2 characters to be in a kart at the same time, and to switch which one is driving and throwing items, any fan of the series will feel at home. You can use switching characters to your advantage as each character can hold a different item. But at its core, Double Dash is a great racing game that anyone in the family can enjoy."
3,"Game is fun, but its an almost mirror from the original","I've been waiting for this game to come out for some time now since I am a huge fan of the original Super Mario Kart. I went out and bought the game today, and really wasn't that happy with it. I mean, don't get me wrong, its fun, but it seems like its the exact same game as the previous with less tracks on it. The graphics are good and there are some more modifications done, but overall, I think I'm gonna have to say the Nintendo 64 version is much better as far as fun gameplay. Nintendo should have added more options and tracks that it did in this one. Overall, the game is fun, there was just not much new."
4,Great!!!,"I work at Toys ""R"" Us In Philadelphia and I have played the game. Well, the demo and I can tell you just by playing the first board is great. The boards are sharp and 3D computer designed as they come. The characters in it are as real as they can get.If you played Super Smash Brothers you'll know that Bowser is rude and mean well, He's badder then ever in this one. One of the best things in this game is that there are a few secret characters in it as well. Such as, nah, I won't tell. Don't wanna spoil it for everyone but I'll give you a hint. He was in Mario Kart 64 Think about it. And she's is his wife. Hmmmmmmm. Well, I hope you all get it. It's a great game and I give it a 5 Star. rent it if you have to but you won't wanna put the controller down. it's GREAT."
5,Awesome,"I love the Mario Kart series but this one took a new twist. Adding a second character to your kart for extra fun. Double Dash is brilliantly crafted, awesome graphics and cool stages you'll love to play over and over again, especially Baby Park as it can get pretty wild after the first 2 laps.Tons of characters to choose from and unlock, every character has their own special weapon. The best being Bowser and Baby Bowser's Giant Bowser Shell, Donkey and Diddy's Giant Bananas and Yoshi and Birdo's Egg. Pick any of these characters and you will have a disaster path behind you.One of the best games to play with your friends or alone, either way, a must play and a must buy."
4,Maadio Karta,"Great Game. Graphics-they're the best that they could possibly make it. What do you expect for a racing game? It's definetly better than the previous three. In this game there are more items, great courses, and lots of characters. I like how you can win extra charaters too. This game has one weakness. There are not enough courses. You can come in first place on 100cc Star Cup to get Special Cup to get extra races (which I have not managed to do yet) but on Mario Kart 64, you start out with 16 races. Other than that, it's a good game."
5,Soild Grab Bar,This is an excellent grab bar. The stainless steel looks great and has a nice tight fitting flange. Other grab abrs I looked at have large holes around the flange cover that collect dirt. I installed the bar with their wingit fastener - Awesome Product! I also bought a Platinum grab bar from the same company - more exspensive but I love the threded flange. I would highly recommend this grab bar and the wingit fastenrs to everyone.
5,Good Going Good Grips!,"I'm a long time fan of OXO GoodGrips kitchen and garden tools, I recently improved my car washing chores by buying an OXO Car Wash Brush. When I heard they were coming out with a whole line of tools for the home I had to try them. This hammer is probably the first real advance in a basic carpentry tool in 100 years. You have to see, feel and try one to appreciate how well engineered and designed this tool is. It is a pleasure to hold and to use, intelligently designed for those of us who are not in the Carpenter's Union. Non-slip, soft handles, mar-guard to ease the task of pulling nails and picture hooks, a little ""give"" in the shaft to prevent wrist injuries from unforgiving old-fashioned hammers. I like this so much I want the whole collection."
3,"5 stars for the special, 1 star for the DVD","Joseph Brando's review is spot-on; everything he wrote is accurate to-the-letter concerning yet another ridiculous and unnecessary Warner reissue of a Rankin-Bass animation classic. 'tis such a shame that R-B titles have been so badly botched in recent years. Remember the godawful Destiny's Child video slapped onto the ""Original Television Christmas Classics"" box set a few years ago???Now, let me address the previous revewier, ""A. King"". Umm... I hate to tell you this but you don't appear to know much about Rankin-Bass animation. The studio did not use Claymation in its animation but the tried-and-true wire armature process. Think the original King Kong... and a Happy 75th B-day to you, Kong!!! ;) 'Claymation' is a term trademarked exactly 30 years ago by it's creator, Will Vinton.With that said, buy the original release ofThe Easter Bunny Is Comin' to Townand have a blast with Sunny, Gadzooks and the Big Rock Candy Mountain!!!"
5,DVD,It's an awesome addition the my extensive DVD collection and I couldn't be happier with the quality of the DVD
5,Ten again..,I love this movie. All of these stop motion moves are timeless! This one has a great message and memorable songs too. It is great for all ages with a wonderful message for everyone.
5,Bowser the Hound,Do you like books where people get lost and have to find there way back? This is like that except it's a dog that gets himself lost. Bowser's chasing Old Man Coyote and gets lost. Blacky tries to help Bowser get back to Farmer Brown's house.This bookis recommended for dog lovers and animal lovers too.BySpencer
3,Meh,"These pills made my boyfriends sister's hair grow like a weed, so I ordered them, despite their high cost. Shortly after, I fount a similar product made by Natures Bounty, with almost identical ingredients, for less than half the price and over double the servings. The up-side to these is they are easier for me to swallow, yes they are large in size, but they have a smooth surface that didn't cling to the wall of my throat as the natures bounty version does. I couldn't justify spending this much on something, knowing there is an almost identical product out there. I only took a months worth, so I'm not sure if it did anything to my length, or not. Side note, if you order these, drink A LOT of water with them, if you don't, you may get these weird red welts, that resemble a puss-less pimple. I got quite a few of them while taking these, it wasn't very attractive. I don't get them with the natures bounty, though, thankfully."
4,Technique Required,"I had to learn to use this tool. First, the blade would not stay stable--it needs to be tightened with pliers. There are marks to indicate blade placement--the standard mat mark is not deep enough, go almost to double mat mark. I set everything up to cut on carpeted floor--that created too much give to cut straight, it cut straight when set up on a concrete floor. ALSO, cutter needs a straight edge to keep it lined up--a plastic ruler won't work, I used a metal edge."
3,Bought for 7x feature,"As other reviewers for other models complained, the 3 level light is useless, unless for some reason you wanted a night light. The frame is very sensitive to touch so it's easy to accidentally turn the light on. But the reason I bought it was it was on sale for 19.99 and was cheaper than buying an unlit version at 7x, which I've had a hard time finding in my area. There is NO distortion on the 7x or plain mirror. It is big and bulky, so I won't be taking it on vacation, but I'm glad I have it for work mornings."
3,Finally ripe for listening!,"I was always fascinated by electronic music since I first heard about it, and needless to say, the Apples are by all means pioneers in this genre. I was given a copy of their 1st lp in 1971 and I still have it. I understand it never made it to top 40 radio, since it was only for certain tastes. From what I can tell they seem to have concocted a crude form of synthsizer, known as oscillators, since this was long before the portable synth became a consumer product. Mr Simeon does well for one man at playing all bass and lead instruments, even though he has to settle for 2-note bass lines in each track. Dan Taylor never misses a beat with his 13 piece set, making himself the first human drum machine.Though innovative, it lacks the refinement of modern studio technology, but I applaud their efforts. Thomas Edison would have been a fan!"
3,1967,"I would have loved this in 1967 . Fuzzy theremin style music , exciting and experimental ... for 1967 . Brings back a bit of the feelings / moods of the time , but this is not Magical Mystery Tour or Saucerful Of Secrets"
4,you need to hear this if you like today's electronica,"People complain about the lyrics-It's poetry! This music is BENT. Only listen to it if you are avant garde and there won't be any problems. This is more pure than ""The Garden"" because it was all recorded at one time. ""The Garden"" was reworked in the 90's on every other track. Not that I don't like ""Garden"". I'm listening to this album right now and all I can say is that they are contenders for the elusive trophy of art rock champions. Look deeper into this band and you will see how amazing they were for a brief, bright flash in time."
4,"Like, WOW Man... Like ... far out","I heard the Silver Apples as a College DJ on WNTC radio,Clarkson College (now Clarkson University) in 1969. We hada 45 single on Kapp ""Oscillations"" byt the Silver Apples. I played the ^%$& out of it! It made our ""WNTC (Wincee)Dean's List"" rocketing up to #4. It was Peter Post's(My air name then and now) ""PICK to CLICK""If you like Avant Gaurd music, a style a decade ahead ofit's time, It's the Silver Apples for you.. Turn off the lights, turn up the volume (If it's Too LOUD you're TOO OLD)and... scrape the dried insides of a Banana Peel into an oldpipe and Light it! GRoooooovy, man! Hip & Far out!!!You will relive the 60's again, and Donovan will do a tap dance on your head! It may take more than one playing, and itmight not be your cup of tea (cough-cough) at first... Just listen to the musical style so unique it's hard to describe..It's just WOW! Get out your love beads and burn your draft cards and bras... the 60's live again!!"
2,unbearable vocals...,"I'll put this simply, wonderful drumming, great bleeps, awful vocals, i mean really awful, and mixed high. If you can get past the vocals, or remix the music without the vocals, you'll be well pleased."
2,Tired and dated,"Interesting, but hardly essential. Yes, electronic music starts here. So what? The sign of a great album is if you can listen to it twice in a row. I'd confess to a crime I didn't commit before listening to this more than once."
4,way ahead of its time,"this duo created music that was way ahead of the time in 1968-69. not everything on this album is exceptional, but it is very intriguing nonetheless. the music ranges from amusing to eerie. the songs are strange and mystical,yet often very catchy, rythmic, and ethereal. i would say that the 1st album is the better of the two, but contact contains what may very well be the silver apples' finest accomplishment , the superb "" A pox on you"", a truly incredible and ominous sounding track that is done with great emotion and excellent percussion. fans of psychedelic rock of the 60's as well as techno-industrial bands( which i normally loathe) will enjoy this prophetic release. for example,if you like, say, (the band not the country!) the united states of america , you'll probably like this also.a highly recommended release, especially if you're interested in the roots of electronic music in rock"
4,Why doesn't everybody know about Silver Apples!?,"I first heard this album, which is a combination of both of their original releases, while visiting England. I heard it in a record store and asked the clerk if it was new or old: I couldn't tell. For something new, it was artful and timely with innovative use of electronic sound. For something older, it had pleasant lyrics which were magically woven into unusual experimental sounds. Well, it was not only older, but 30 years ahead of it's time! I mean, people talk about Kraftwerk doing it first, but Silver Apples truly CREATED something no one else had done before and the world was surely not ready for their visions. In speaking to those who truly are interested in music, you'll find that many people not only know who Silver Apples are, but have been greatly influenced by their feat and hold them in very high regard."
2,A Severe Disappointment,"I picked up this album after hearing that Silver Apples basically invented electronic music, and since I'm always interested in musical evolution, I decided to give it a try. The fact of the matter is this: If it weren't for the fact that this was one of the first bands to use electronics, no one would listen to them. The trembling high-pitched vocals are obnoxious to say the least, the song structures are basically nonexistant, and the lyrics are terrible. I'll add a star for influence, but give me Kraftwerk any day."
1,Would give it zero stars if possible... Awful.,I really hated this cd. It was all around very eccentric as far as both the music and the singing. Most of it was too psychotic and over the top to be even remotely enjoyable. What a let down. This cd has been considered by some to be ahead of its time but in reality it's just over rated noise. Remember though that this is my opinion and music reviews are subjective. But I would advise anyone who is considering this cd to think twice before wasting your money.
3,Far from Ninja Scroll spirit,This is not like the movie. This is different and not bad...There are some impressive effects and the story is interesting... I'll buy all the volume of the serie.
2,ninja scroll: the series,"If you are reading this review i strongly advise you do not purchase the Ninja Scroll series! As an anime fan i have obviously seen the Ninja Scroll movie which i strongly sudgest you purchase, but this series has nothing to do with the movie, the action is repetitive and usually results in a foe beign cut in half by Jubei. If you want to ignore my sudgestion, it's your cash not mine, but you will grow tired of robotic ninjas and other un-inspired stuff."
3,One drawback,Doesn't seem to pick up other instruments in the immediate area when tuning...but..clip does not open very wide so harder to clamp onto my harp
3,Cord is not long enough for a harp,"I am a harp student and have used this with a Sabine MT9000 chromatic tuner. It has helped me greatly with accuracy and speed when tuning, as described. However, I feel that this should be advertised for use with other instruments, such as violins, cellos, etc. I found the cord to be far too short for even a smaller lever harp, and it required me to constantly hold it up with one hand as I was tuning. The tuner pick up should be long enough to rest comfortably on the music stand from any position on the harp.My instructor uses the Korg CM-100 and finds it a comfortable length, even for her concert grand pedal harp. She told me I should return it if I could. For harpists, spend your money on the Korg--it is at least a foot longer."
5,Excellent source for Irish Names,"The authors list a number of traditional IrishGaelic names, with both the earliest knownspelling and the modern Gaelic spelling. Eachentry includes a derivation and translation ofthe name's meaning and a discussion of the historyof the name, often listing notable historical orlegendary figures who bore it. Many entries alsoinclude common Anglicizations, and there is a tableof English names at the end of the book that listsGaelic ""equivalents"".By far the most informative, best-researched bookon the topic I've seen.The same book has also been published as:Irish Personal Namesby a different publisher (whose name escapes me at the moment."
5,I've just discovered Paul Muni,"Hard to believe movies THIS great existed before I was even born! The title is misleading. Though the film is about Zola,it,specifically, deals with his later life when he involved himself, hesitantly, at first, with the unjustly accused/incarcerated Alfred Dreyfus . The film is first rate, intense, high drama, well-acted by Paul Muni as Zola. Excellent to educate yourself about this notorious case of French anti-semitism. Not their proudest moment!"
4,Chorus Skating,"This book is the second book in the Son of Spellsinger series by Alan Dean Foster. It is the first book of his that I had ever read but it has made me a fan of his books for life. The book has distinct undertones of social commentary; but its most distinctive feature is its ability to make the reader laugh. For any Fantasy fans who are ready for just plain old fashioned fun, this book is a delightful read."
5,Pure Pleasure,"If there was ever music created that becomes one with your soul, then this is it. I feel very connected to each mood as it moves from melodic to introspective.At times you feel like an eagle soaring high above the earth. This music will lift your spirit.The trademark style of piano and Native American flute, along with voice and percussion will create a relaxing mood for you to enjoy.Perfect for playing when giving or receiving a massage. This music is also like a massage for your heart.Truly Beautiful.~The Rebecca Review"
3,It's a book for $.02,"But it tastes like a $2 book. For two cents what more can you ask for. Eat your way through the new companies, formed just months before printing. Tastes great with a lemon dill sauce."
5,Very speedy and accommodating,"Great seller! He initially sent the worng book but IMMEDIATELY and KINDLY corrected the problem. Would certainly buy from him again. Also, the shipping was very speedy!"
1,miserable product,"All the comments here are spot on. I found a much better unit called the 'digisnap' (made by harbortronics) which works better, both as a remote release (longer cable, no filter) and a timelapse controller (much faster interval -- 5 sec vs. 2 min). Skip the Nikon unit."
2,I agree with the other reviewers,"- a poorly designed product, can't read the display, can't push the buttons, can't predict what is going to happen or when the camera is going to lock up after you push them. Very disappointing. Unfortunately, it is necessary for close-up work and long exposures."
1,"Terrible, just terrible.","I don't know how to say what a terrible product this is. I bought it to use with my old Coolpix 990 (which I love), but I only managed to get it to work once for a few minutes. There seems to be something extremely sensitive about the connector to the camera. I had to rig up an elaborate system of rubber bands to hold the connector in exactly the right position to get the remote to work at all, and I was never again able to reproduce the same setup. I returned it to Nikon under warranty and got a replacement that performed exactly the same. I really hate the MC-EU1, and I've never said that before about any gadget of any kind."
3,Lengthen the cord,"I suspect Nikon may have modified this item since many of the reviews were written. I can't speak for the interval problem, as I don't use it for that. However, in my version the RF filter just snaps around the cord. It takes only seconds to get rid of the RF weight and gain several inches of reach--the cord is 40"" long without it."
2,Used Sold as New,"I paid full price for this remote, and was disappointed to find that I had received a used one instead. The box was battered, and the previous owner's receipt was folded in along with the manual. The LCD, hard to read at best, is obviously scratched and well worn by the previous owner. The included battery also looked as though it had been previously opened.The unit itself seems poorly designed, with recessed buttons that are difficult for large fingers to press, and a cord that is quite short (which I don't mind, honestly), and a horribly placed ferrite core attached right where the cable plugs into the camera. The software interface with the camera seems dodgy as well, I was quickly able to get the camera into a state where it wouldn't respond to the cable, and had to be power-cycled to work again.I bought this primarily for doing macro work and long exposure work, for which it it better than nothing, but beyond that, I am not impressed."
1,"So witless, it's Insulting - Minus 5 Stars if I had the choice",The idea that I would have to pay more than 10$ to remotely operate the camera is rediculous. Obviously Nikon wants to deal with only the people who don't care about cost. That is an insult to those who care about taking good pictures but also have brains when it comes to money. I want to take timed exposures and that ability should already be in the camera. In fact all they need to do is upgrade the firmware. Their worst mistake is the fact that they wasted harware on what could have been a software solution.Just plain witless!!!
2,NOT A HAPPY CAMPER,"The remote is too small, and why is the diagram showing where the different parts are, only in German and Japanese? In this country, English is still the primary language, and I may read German, but I don't understand enough to translate the instructions here. Also, I can't see the print on the remote in the dark, and the buttons are a little too small, even for my small fingers. I don't understand why the camera locks up after I change the battery, and it's very frustrating to try and use something that is just going to mess up my camera, and thus my project. Also, the cord is a bit too short. Can't say I'm happy with this item."
2,Not too impressed,They show too much of your real nose and you can see a line. They also rip too easily to be used by little kids.
2,Party favors,I don't really have much to say as these were used for a party favor and not really played with at my house. They seemed durable and fun. They arrived in a timely fashion but for the price the shipping was outrageous.
1,Outrageous Shipping For Foam Clown Noses,"Here's a good price for clown noses. I happen to need about 250. After a long search, I finally found some for a decent price. Then ... came the shipping, which was about 8 times the cost of the actual merchandise. AND THE NOSES WEIGHT NOTHING! I did not complete my order. That is just not right. Very bad business."
3,"Book Content Good, CD is . . .","As usual, everything Martin Pring has to say is of the utmost value. This book is proving to be a great aid as I re-vamp all my stock screens and filters. But, what's with the CD? Hey Martin - some of us use a Mac! There are several comments regarding the value of the content on the CD - too bad I won't be able to access it unless I borrow someone's Windows machine. Had this CD been authored with something that was OS-agnostic I would have awarded the full 5 stars, but the CD is useless to me as-is.Update: I installed the CD on an XP machine, and was taken back to the mid-90's with the install program. I hope the information in the book is more current than this CD. And you need to have the CD loaded to run the program whenever you want to view it. Reminds me of my old gaming days with DOS or Win 3.1."
5,Excellent value,"I'm using this heart rate monitor as a marathon training tool and so far it has worked great.Pros.1. Comfortable (both the wrist and chest part)2. Accurate readings.3. Value.4. Easy to replace batteries.Cons.1. Limited functionality.2. Can't display both time and heart rate at the same time.3. Maybe too big for smaller girls. I'm 5'8 140lbs and it fits me great but the chest strap can only be tightened maybe one more inch. Of course, you can always modify the strap."
2,"Works, for a while...","When its working, it is fairly accurate, within 1 or 2 bpm. Unfortunately, after about 20 minutes of constant sweaty use, it stops working right. HR reading spikes up to 220+, the heartbeat monitor on the watch face blinks way faster than my heart is beating. Its not interference, since this happens indoors and outdoors. I dont sweat too much. I've tried different placements on my chest, adjusted the strap, nothing. After 20 or so minutes, it just goes haywire."
4,New Offices in USA,This book privide you with great concepts and solutions to makeyour offices look like muti-million dollar head quarters. It providesfull page color photos highlighting concepts and strategies behind the great minds of interior design gurus. The down-side with this book is with price ...
2,"A hidden gem, perfect for the family","This movie made in 1949 (not 1933) but does take place in 1933 is a big adventure filmed in Technicolor. The story is on a par with a Disney wilderness adventure and shows Forrest Tucker in a good starring role as the head of the family of one of the feuding families.A love story, suspense, action and beautiful scenery is diluted by the transfer from this budget release from Digiview. It actually looks like it was recorded from a VHS copy .... at slow speed! Maybe this hidden gem by director Phil Karlson will get a more respectable treatment. But for now, this is the only available release."
4,Indeed a Hidden Gem in Need of Polish,"I agree with both reviewers, especially the comment that this film deserves better restoration than it has received. It's early Phil Karlson, and one can sense the grim sincerity, the commitment to theme and detail, and the simmering violence that were to explode in the fifties into the best of Karlson -- 99 River Street, The Phenix City Story, The Scarface Mob (the theatrical release version of the Untouchables pilot) -- and later into Walking Tall. Despite the muddy transfer, I became absorbed in this film. The scenes involving the cougar are unflinching and avoid cheating through editing -- would love to know how Karlson managed to film them!"
3,"Inventive lyrics, solid vocals","I like this recording and find myself playing it regularly. It's the kind of music that grows on you. There are two lead singers, a male and a female; that's a little unusual; but it's a nice ""different."" The songs are mostly alternative with perhaps some folk-rock influences. I especially New Year's day, a song about a meeting with Stephan Hawking. The record may be a bit too cerebral to be popular with the masses. I saw them in person after I had already had the album for a couple of months. They have talent."
2,Weak,"It's clear the author is a brilliant physicist but the text would do well do offer some less applied applications and hit more on theory, I personally prefer Jame's Marsdan take on vector calculus and would at least recommend one of his texts as a supplement."
2,"Interesting Companion To The Filmmaker's Book, ""Naked Filmmaking""","With realistic lighting, smooth camera moves, great sound, solid editing and unfortunately an undeveloped story populated by an amateur cast shot mostly in close ups..."
4,The Subtle Dark Underside of Some Night People With a Secret,"They may seem to be your average neighborhood bar patrons. They come out at night and form their own communities in the bars and alleys. They all have their quirky personalities...and some have deadly secrets. Writer / Director Mike Carroll produces another of his studies in relationships with an excellent ensemble cast of pros that takes you on a tour of the neighborhoods you may not want to visit late at night. Mike Carroll is the consummate film noir cinematic storyteller who presents an intriguing glimpse into this world in the shadows... from drugs, to sex, to detectives...and murder."
1,Don't Bother,"After 25min of rambling dialog, no plot or character development and a droning monotone of narration I turned it off. This is at best an amateur film school student effort. At its worst, to compare it to classic film noir is criminal. I watch film noir weekly, and this doesn't even come close to resembling the genre. Save your $1.99 and spend it on classics from the post-war period if you want to see real film noir."
5,DEEP & DARK,"This is an exceptional work with well performed characters set in the dark under belly of San Francisco. Way out of the hollywood mainstream, this sexy story weaves itself like an oily snake in the grass field of skyscrapers while digging deep into the motives that drive the protagonist into a head-on mental crash. If you're sick and tired of the ""Hollywood"" dribble, this is for you. BUT! Be prepared, and watch it late at night! Better with a glass of good wine and on the weekend when you don't have to get up and go to work the next morning. If unemployed, anytime is OK."
4,Traditional business values.,"When executives hear the term ""customer relationship management"" (CRM), they often break out in a cold sweat amid visions of six- or seven-figure implementations of staggeringly complex systems. But have no fear, you won't stumble over such looming obstacles in James G. Barnes's book. Rather he chooses an old-fashioned approach to CRM: actually building relationships with your customers. Barnes provides a variety of techniques to accomplish this basic task. Some of his suggestions are fresh and inspired, while others will sound pretty familiar to anyone in business. Either way, he documents them with his own thorough research and insightful accounts from other writers. Some readers will miss the nuts-and-bolts technical analysis that has come to define the modern concept of CRM, but getAbstract recommends this book to executives, marketing professionals and customer service managers who want to get back to traditional business values."
3,Fun Upbeat Group,"A precursor group to Steps and in the vein of 2 Unlimited, Twenty 4 Seven, Sound Factory, Captain Hollywood Project, etc. Not exactly sure about the exact date of the recordings, but they are seem to be around the same early to mid-nineties as most of these other groups. Most of the music is a faster beat w/some male rapping as was popular at that time. There are some odd moments and a couple of definite off-notes when harmonizing.Songs are as follows:1-Do U Wanna Boogie2-Feel the Night3-Heartbeat4-Move That Body5-Victim6-Summertime7-That's the Way I Like It8-Mr. Dance & Mr. Groove9-Go Away10-Pray11-Take Control12-Power People2 dance remixes of above songs Feel the Night; Do U Wanna Boogie"
4,Nice for background,"Burt Bacharach composed some really nice songs back in his time and this is a compilation of ""instrumental"" versions of some of his songs.However, part of the magic in his songs were teh lyrics that accompanied them. I'm not saying that this CD is bad. If you know the songs, you can sing along as if it were a karaoke disc. I enjoy it as background when words are too distracting in music."
5,Don't sleep on this one. DEFINITE MUST HAVE!!!!,"This CD is BANANAZ!!!! Excellent production + Anointed, Christ-centered TIGHT flow = Award-winning CD. Japhia Life delivers the good news of Christ with lyrical genius over heavy-hitting, energetic, memorable tracks that will have you on your feet. This CD can definetly hold it's own against any rap CD out, Christian or secular. If you're into rap Fountain of Life will be in heavy rotation in your CD player or on your MP3 player."
3,Average stuff,"The three stars are on the strength of the beats alone. The beats on this album are crazy.They content is a different story.From Preacher Man:""It's 1977, November to be exactSome babies are still born,I'm alive it's a blessing.My mommy's water broke earlyCould have been still born,her baby was still born""That's pretty weak lyrically, and just one example.Japhia spits more like a ""positive"" rapper instead of a Christian rapper. Plus there isn't a whole lot of lyrics on the album, it's like he spits two short verses on each song and throws in a hook. But the beats are bangin!The CD didn't move me at all on the spiritual side. And on the rap side, he didn't have any stand out lines. Just an average CD.If you like the east coast feel that Japhia has, check out Phanatik and The Ambassador."
4,Great VIBE,i like Japh....his is a great artist....on this Fountain of Life...he had some good songs on it....that you can bob ya head to...i do think some of the beats didnt fit his style on a few songs....but overall its with buying....you will enjoy it
5,Works for me and reasonably priced.,"I purchased this wireless water alarm because I could not hear my ""basement watchdog"" alarm over the sound of the water recently when I was taking a shower. 30 more seconds of shower and my basement would have been flooded. Good thing I quit the shower when I did. All I ended up with was a laundry room with about 10 square feet of concrete floor covered with water and no damage. So I did a lot of research and in spite of a few negative reviews which I read, I purchased the Sonin. It works excellent for me, but I only use it over a distance of about 15 feet from the basement to the upstairs bathroom. I am buying another one for our second bathroom. As far as the fact that some people don't seem to like it, maybe they are placing the receiver a bit farther away from the sensing unit. I am very pleased with this product."
5,Wow great product,"At first I was skeptical about the quality of this item based on it's low price. I was genuinely impressed by the sturdiness of case on both the sensor and the receiver. The performance is just as good. I tested it in the sink before installation and it worked fine. The two halves are not only 30 feet away from each other, the receiver is upstairs tucked away behind a table. After two weeks I purposely spilled some water on the sensor and the Sonin worked perfectly again-a great product."
1,Wireless link fails,"I had the same problems others have noted. The link to the remote receiver fails, with no warning, even though both the 'test' routines work on both the transmitter and receiver separately. Thus the product is useless"
2,unreliable water alarm,"I've had one now for about 7 months, the base sensor/alarm unit works fine but the separate remote wireless receiver/alarm stopped working after a few months, i tried all the suggestions the customer service agent recommended with no luck, price is low but i guess you get what you pay for...not recommended..."
3,A fitting title for a sensitive topic,"This book offers a technical, in-depth look at the difficult phenonenon of transexualism. The author set out to discover facts and statistics about trassexualism for all socio-economic classes regarless of race, creed or colour. The facts presented allow the reader to draw their own conclusions, rather than force feed the reader an opinion.Well written, honest, and difficult to put down. I highly recommend this book."
1,A total waist of money,I rented this DVD thinking it was going to be as funny as the others in the comedy series but I didn't laugh at all. In fact I didn't even finish watching it. It was not funny at all. Get Bruce Bruce's dvd instead. That was funny!
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this book thinking it would be sentences that I could replicate for my students, while there were some sentences, it was so much less sentences than her discussing what she does in the classroom. I will be selling this series."
5,WHAT CAN YOU SAY.....,One of Joan Crawford's best movies. I was so glad that it finally came to DVD.
5,Joan Crawford does it again...,"Another great film noir, that takes a little different approach to things than others. This time, its told from the woman's perspective. Joan Crawford starts out as forlorn woman, whom, you're not quite sure what she's going to do.The story plays out, single woman trying to make good trying to make ends meet and give her children everything she never had, with a scheming, spoilt daughter that knows exactly how to get what she wants.Problem is, a body has been found, question is, who did it?The details are recounted while Mildred delivers a narrative of events to the local police. While the viewer might be able to work it out by about the half-way point, the enjoyment in the film comes with how the story plays out and exactly who does what to get to the end and what the consequences are."
5,Timeless!,"The perennial Joan Crawford delivers an exquisite portrait of an unconditionally devoted mother in this very riveting melodrama. She plays a simple mother that strives to provide the world and its wonders on a gold platter to her daughter, Veda, who turns out spoiled and quite evil. Of course, a Joan's movie won't be complete without plenty of melodrama and a catty character (only this time it isn't Joan's), both with which this film is rife.Sometimes the dynamics between the mother and the daughter are inconsistent and very illogical. Nevertheless, this is truly a great classic worthy of your attention."
4,Why she got to be Joan Crawford,"Not exactly my cup of tea, but between Joan Crawford, Jack Carson and Michael Curtiz this odd domestic noir has nothing but class. Based on a James M. Cain (Double Indemnity, Postman always Rings Twice) novel, the movie shows its period both in its arms length treatment of its sexual content and in the""fairness"" of its end. But this is Crawford the Academy Award winner, not the ""Mommie Dearest"" cartoon. Allow for the period and enjoy."
3,An Archaic Curio,"An archaic and rather lengthy film with an unusually detailed storyline--some of which touches on universal themes of human nature--avarice, seduction, ambition,fraud, etc. Enjoyable to watch the stars of old, but really couldn't get into the more ludicrous aspects of the plot. The ending in particular made little sense when you think about it. Logic is not this film's strong point."
4,good movie,I had to watch this movie for a film class and it was actually a movie that I enjoyed and was entertained by.
4,Art imitating life by a true HOLLYWOOD star,"There is something surreal about Ms Crawford's life and career and the way they intertwine to make a fascinating but entertaining study. MILDRED PIERCE the film seems to be a vehicle that Ms Crawford was born to play so uncannily does it seem to mirror her broader experiences ; with success from impoverishment to wealth; with men - the good man figure, the lazy aristocrat spoiled sponger male figure, the businessman hustler figure; with children - her relationship with her daughter which turned sour. Whatever the motivations, Ms Crawford and her character are driven, unhappy creatures, searching but seemingly unable to find love they so achingly desire. Melodrama? Perhaps, but a terrific melodrama. An excellent and revealing but ultimately sympathetic documentary narrated by Angelica Huston, is included and complements this fine film."
4,Mildred Pierce,Seemed much better than when I was young. I didn't understand the plot then. Second time 'round it was excellent!
5,Ultimate Crawford,"Here is the story of your average post-World War II housewife who believes that nothing is too good--or too much--for her two precious daughters. By the time this great soap opera is over, she has buried one child, experienced the murder of a cheating, mooching sleazeball of a husband, sent the other daughter off to prison, and gone into bankruptcy. But at least Eve Arden's character is good for a few laughs. At the end, though, she seems to reconcile with her first husband, whom she kicked out of the house in the first reel for losing his job. It's nice to know one can sometimes start out all over again."
5,I am on my way to watch it again,"This is Joan Crawford at her best in a thoroughly entertaining film. Also, the DVD comes with a great retrospective of her career."
5,"Great performance, great movie","I watched ""Mommie Dearest"" a week or so before seeing this movie and that movie showed the pressure and tension Joan Crawford was under when this movie came around to her. She was already considered a has-been and had been dumped by Mayer's studio and so it was quite a triumph when she won a best actress Oscar for this film. And well deserved it was. It's a great film about a powerful, but flawed woman/mother and what she does to keep her life and her daughters' lives bearable. One of the top 100 films ever, in my opinion, both for the performance and the story it tells."
4,Joan Crawford's Tour-de-Force!,"This is Joan Crawford's movie all the way. Women's film noir. Great direction by Michael Curtiz, and a top-notch supporting cast. Ann Blyth is a stand-out as the bitchy ungrateful little daughter. It has some soap-operish qualities but it still doesn't diminish the quality and the entertainment value of the film. Joan Crawford delivers a legendary performance. Great script that also works as a murder mystery. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"
5,"Valuable, practical advice for business owners & CEOs","This book offers valuable and practical risk management advice for business owners and CEOs. Solid how-to examples help those who are addressing these issues for the first time as well as experiened executives who want a fresh, unbiased perspective.A must-have resource for owners, CEOs and those who work with them."
5,Moving!,"I was a singer in this performance. The climax at the end -- where we were singing as loud as we could, ""Resurrect! Thou shalt Resurrect!"" -- was perhaps the most moving singing experience I've had in my 12 years of singing performance. I loved this work from the begining to the end. I can't listen to it enough!"
1,Not worth it,"After researching the ""best knives"" out....I finally decided to order this set for my parents. Unfortunately, my parents wish they had never gotten rid of their old knives because these brand new J.A. Henckels were WORSE than their old ones. (Which were MANY years old) I am not satisfied with this product and will not be ordering any products from the J.A.Henckels brand any more."
4,Excellent for hi speed drives,"These CD-RW's are actually very stable, the slim case isnt my favorite of cases, but if you drive bears a Hi Speed logo on the drive, then GET THESE DISCS! Your drive can take advantage of the 10X write speed, and this media is ERASEABLE! Very nice indeed, instead of waiting 20 minutes for your data to cook, you wait 6 minutes, that is IF your drive is equipped with the Hi Speed logo. If it is not, then do not buy this product as your drive cannot write to it."
1,Don't buy These,"The reason I purchased the product was because of it's 10x capability my Plextor drive has. Well I have opened 6 cd's and 2 of them worked properly, 3 didn't work at all, and 1 took data, but won't erase. I would like to send the sob's back to TAIWAN where they came from."
4,Good for price,this was my first purchase for my cd-rw..... It was one of the best purchases i had..(other then my IBM thinkpad).. It was one of the finer products for man.
5,Rap-Core with a positive message,"I've had this cd for almost a year now and I still havent worn it out. Every song rocks hard and it is a good listen from beginning to end. The realm of Christian music is expanding rapidly and bands like this show that just because you're a Christian, it doesnt mean your music cant kick a little butt."
5,"You like RAP/CORE? If so,PROJECT 86 is what it's all about.","*DUDE*. You like the *SOUND* of KORN, RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE, LIMP BIZKIT??? *HATE* the negative message??? Check out the PROJECT. They just, how should I put it?--ROCK. They simply TEAR IT UP. FAT rifts, siiiiick bass-lines, incredible drums, and INTENSE vocals/lyrics make *****PROJECT 86***** a MUST for any convicted CHRISTian rap/core fan. Check 'em. You'll DIG IT."
5,Ride the edge!,"Project 86 can kick out some major music. I went to their show with POD and Blindside, and they rocked Cruces. Project 86 is a must for your collection."
5,hard core! unique christian rock,"these guys take the gospel to another level. with vocals louder than Rollins band and RATM-esque riffs, these beats are sure to please. worth checking out!"
5,"This CD was long overdue, but well worth the wait","This CD of Project 86 is packed full of emotion and energy. If you are expecting the CD to be no where near the experiance of the live show, you will be pleasently suprised. I give this a BIG 5 stars. Buy it now!!!!--Josh yuen"
5,awesome christian band,"i liked this cd very much. i thought it was excellent. at first when i started to listen to the first song i didn't think that id like it, but later on in the cd i thought it rocked. im a christian and most of the bands i don't prefer, but u can sign me up for P.O.D and Project 86 as my fav christian bands."
3,Good Start to a Great Band,"Projects breakout album was a good one indeed. Not as strong as DBL or STBYBB, but still a good album. The only reason this got 3 stars is simply for a hint of monotany throughout the album. The album still rocks hard enough for most metal heads to catch on. The definite standout songs on the album were ""Pipe Dream"" and ""Run"". They displayed a great lyrical style and varied within the song so they were unique umong the other 8 tracks, and just plain out ROCKED. I bought the album just for those 2 songs and it was well worth it."
5,I like this better than drawing black lines,"when i got this cd i was much younger and didnt like hard rock very much... i now listen to bands like Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson...they are amazing however, i found a christian band that actually had potentialthis is by far the best christian band ever to set foot on earth.This is a short cd and at first it is hard to get used to, because all of the songs sound the same. but, if you listen to it enough where you can tell which song is which, this album is perfect.i dont know why i liked this better than DBL. i cant tell you why. i just did. but i think it has something to do with the time i got into DBL. i got into it way before i got into this album. so i guess with time it became inferior.but anyways if you like bands like NIN and Marilyn Manson, but you want something christian that is still good, LISTEN TO PROJECT 86...ps. i have yet to hear truthless heroes and songs to burn your bridges by. i will purchase them soon."
2,...86 SE...,"...When i heard Project 86, i was not impressed. Their songs, though hard, are somewhat messy and are somewhat boring. Nothing extremely special, but if you got some money to waste, here you go. If you are into the whole Christian rapcore, hardcore scene, I think POD has an edge on them. POD has a little more talent and more refinement. But i do not really strongly recommend this or POD. If you want descent hardcore try: Amen, Nothingface, Full Devil Jacket, or Dope...."
2,Worked in begining,"After about 10 discs, anything burned would not read in the burner or my computer drive."
4,very cheesy French pop,"The only song I knew from this album when I bought it is Amoureux Solitaires, and that song is enough to buy it (or maybe only for me because of its sentimental value - it was the only (big) hit she had in the Netherlands). Lots of synthesizer sounds that are so typical of early 80's music (e.g. Yazoo, Human league) melted into very easy melodies. Fast-food in music: no quality music, but sometimes that is just so nice to listen to."
3,Good concept but difficult,"I understood this would be a project when buying it but I never expected it to be this hard to excavate. My daycare kids and I were so excited to excavate the Great Sphinx!! Yes this project is very messy but oh well that's part of the fun and we also used a tray. After 1 hour we did not get far at all and they were getting bored. After 3 hours I soaked the whole thing in a wash basin with warm water. Even still it took me another hour to completely get all the sediment off. After it looked great! Another tip would to use a sponge, screw driver as a pick, and rough scrubbing brush ;). Cant wait for it to dry out and paint it with them next :)"
1,Lousy product,"My son received the Dig! Indian arrowheads kit. It is awful. My husband had to resort to the garden hose to clean all the muck off. Extremely messy.When it was cleaned, we were left with a pre-molded clay frame, background, and molded arrowhead shapes already in place. What a disappointment! My son wasn't even interested in painting the thing. The clay is very fragile, easily chipped and cracked. It keeps rubbing off on cloth and countertops. A real bust."
3,Assembly required,"I bought this fountain for Christmas. It took me awhile to assemble the tubes and the wiring stuff. I never realized that you can't change the colors to only show one color. It changes colors so quick that you can hardly notice. As another reviewer said, it does spit out a little water in the front, so you really need to place down the little mat thing. The music is ok, nothing special about it. But it is a nice little gift for someone."
1,HoMedics Rainforest Fountain,"I returned this product to the manufacturer. I wanted something to mask the sounds typically heard at night (plumbing, furnace, a car going down the street, etc.) but my computer's fan is louder than this thing. Not a good deal for the money."
4,Awesome,"I received this as a Christmas Gift and think it's awesome! The lights are gorgeous, the ability to adjust the water and sound volume was a great thing to add, and the ability to turn off the lights is brilliant~This is an awesome gift, a great way to create a relaxing atmosphere in any room- and is very attractive and non-imposing to the decor of the room. I have already sent two to co-workers accross the country and will send as a gift again."
4,My thoughts on the Fountain,"I like all the natural sounds on this machine, except for the loon sounds. The sounds are realistic and soothing.It took a while for me to get it set up. The first one did not have all the parts (which makes me wonder if I actually got a new item or if this was a used or returned one). The exchange through Amazon was very prompt and my husband set up the new one.So far so good, I would recommend this item."
2,So-So Fountain,"This fountain is nice looking from a distance, but upclose you will see the so-so cheap looking plastic construction. There are several other negitives about this fountain or any others by HoMedics, and that is the pump, it makes lots of noise. I want to hear the sound of the water, not the humming pump. The 6 natural sounds are on very short loops, meaning after just a few seconds the sounds repeat, and repeat, and repeat. Also the sounds can't be played at a loud volume, if you do you we really hear the quality of the poor speaker. I guess at lower volumes it is fine, and it is, but because it repeats so often it just gets old. I would look else where for a table fountain with a much more quiet pump."
5,Fits the job,"The slide adapter is exactly right for digitizing slides and film strips using the E995 camera. It just screws on the lens and you use the camera macro to take the pictures. You must use an external light source (not included). I prefer sunlight. The front of the adapter has a light diffuser which allows you to use any available light source.The instructions help you with how to mechanically use the adapter, but you will need your camera manual to set up the camera."
1,Incomplete and disappointing.,"This e-book is glaringly incomplete. It was published in 2004 yet doesn't cite any of the author's publications after 1998--and I know she has published at least one more book of poetry and been anthologized in the ""Best of American Poetry"" series twice more. Some interesting bare-bones information, but seven years out of date. Not worth paying for."
4,"Lots of new , but too much of old","This is another magnificent , bone shacking ,eye popping , jaw dropping NFL film , with a lot of never before seen images of the brutality of this game , I did not give it the full five star rating , because , it also contains a lot of stuff seen a hundred times before on many previous NFL videos , I mean , of all the years Lawrence Taylor or Dick Butkus played , they only have the same bleeped out scene , seen on every Crash , Hit , Crunch etc.. film ?"
4,Love it!,"Crash, smack, bang! Who doesn't love that?! One of our favorite get-fired-up films and a must for football enthusiasts. Get it."
4,Bam!,"Oh yeah. This was why i signed up to play football- the impact! I loved to hit and get hit.Without the bone crushing violent impact, football is only two hand touch. Ugh!If you want to get an adrenaline rush long after you have left the game -watch this DVD."
2,Where's Lambert?!!!!,"I must be too old. But I remember Jack Lambert from the Steelers had a hit where he came from nowhere hit the guy straight on. The guys body just wrapped around Lambert's shoulder like uncooked bacon. With his shoulder buried in this guys gut Lambert stood up and dumped the guy on the ground behind him, turned pointed his finger in the guys grill and barked something at him. Now I'm a Dallas fan and I hated the Steelers but I loved to watch the excruciating pain that Jack Lambert would inflict and I am sorely disappointed with this DVD."
5,What a lifesaver!,"Many a night when I have been drained of ideas have I turned to this thick, handy book. It has ready-to-copy worksheets and complete lesson plans that are super-easy to individualize into a workshop model format, if that's your cup of tea. The author includes a variety of activities--solo, partner, small-group, and whole-class--so you can tailor the pre-written lessons to your preference or your class's needs. If you are a secondary English teacher, I HIGHLY recommend this fantastic helper of a book."
3,Good for subs,"If you've got a few days to do these lessons, they'll be just fine. Too much grammar stuff for a regular class though."
3,Just ok...,I teach 7th/8th grade English. This is an ok book. It looked great but did not turn out to be very useful. It had some good ideas but it was not anything I really felt translated well into the classroom. I sold it on ebay.
2,not that good,"This book does not give answers or examples to do most of the activities. For example, on the descriptive writing chapter, it does not provide sample vocabulary to describe smell or taste. Instead, it tells the learner to consult a dictionary."
1,DOESN'T WORK,"I bought this for my 3 month old golden retriever puppy, because he loves to chew the plants out the front porch of my house. He also loves to chew the oriental rug that I have under the livingroom coffee table, he has also peed on it. However, I got the spray and soaked the rug through, waited for it to dry out and put it back in the house, I also sprayed the plants that he chews the most. To make the story short.. next time the puppy went outside, he chewed the plants away, and the next time I brought him into the livingroom he chewed on the rug and peed on it too. So, bottom line, don't waste your money! plus it has a weird smell and including shipping it was almost $20. Just don't."
5,Works great,"I got this to keep my kittens off shelves with glass vases on them. It works great! They sniff it, look displeased, and find somewhere else to play. They love to be up high so I knew this would be a challenge. When I follow the instructions (spray every day) it works great. You don't need to spray a lot so the smaller bottle I got has lasted me months so far and is still at least half full. If I'm consistent they stay away even when I forget. I've only caught one of them on the shelf since I started and that was right after we were all away for a week and a half and this spray had worn off.They also used to sprint into the bathroom as soon as the door was open so I started spraying the doorjam. Now they look like they really, REALLY want to go in but they sit still and wait for me to come out instead."
1,doesnt come with clip belt,"everywhere you can read that this product come with the clip belt, but it doesnt come...it is a lie!"
3,How about a non-biased review?,"I own every DM bass album ever released and many other bass albums from other labels. Although this isn't necessarily one of the classics, there are some good tracks, and then there are some that are plain annoying, which is something to can say for just about any bass album. At least one of the two 1 star ratings are made by an artist screwed over by DM (or just a rabid UMB fan) so take it with a grain."
1,Werd!,"I have never thought about throwing a brand new CD onto the ground, stomping on it and then throwing it out in the street and rejoicing, until I listened to this! It was worth the money alone, just to be able to do that! But, if your into bad 2 Unlimited and Eiffel 65 impersonations, by all means, buy it! You'll have the thrill of your life, just as I did!"
3,"tight fit, but good grips",the grips must be altered a little up high on the right side of the handguards because it can prevent the slide from cycling properly. I suggest trying it at the range first...
4,Great Toy,We bought this toy for our 2 year old and he loves it. Our 3 1/2 yr old will also play with it. Its easy to use and the kids love how he moves while playing music. They havent broke it yet so Im going to say its pretty durable
5,Fun Toy,I've purchased the Learning DJ for my nephews. They loved it. Hard not to since there's lots of blinking lights and sound.
3,Toys for Tots,"Bought this item as a gift for a toddler. He really enjoyed playing with it, but after a short time the microphone quit working because of drool! Would NOT recommend for teething toddlers! Otherwise GREAT!"
3,Sound quality may be an issue,"You can try toys like this one in the store, so you can judge for yourself if the sound quality is all right or not good enough. I didn't have an issue with the sound at first, but some of the instrument selections on the right such as brass aren't as good as percussion, and you'll find that the do-re-mis are poorly articulated depending on the selected instrument.The numbers do go up to 15, and the entire alphabet is present, but you must push the arrow buttons to get them all. That wasn't specifically explained in the manual.The microphone/karaoke feature is negligeable, so don't buy this DJ for this feature.The cuteness factor is there, but the novelty will wear off.The music isn't as catchy as it could be overall.The target age group is entirely off. The real age group for this DJ is 18 months to 3 years, not 2 to 6 as the box states."
5,1963 says it all,"Remember: 1963 was the tottering peak of JFK's Camelot, making this book a radical early '60s phenom: Harry's a glowing isolate, twinned with an equally perfect wife, peaking too soon to be a mass-phenom Boomer. Where does he belong? Does he belong? Belong?"
2,TINY mirror -- no where near 15 inches in height!,"I just received this mirror and am considering returning it. Although the the mirror seems to be of good quality, the mirror is TINY. The description lists it as being 15 inches in height -- it's about 10 inches at best. Very misleading..."
4,"Good, loud, but not perfect.","This alarm works well and I am generally happy with it. It's extremely loud and should work well for basement or garage applications. If I have any gripes, it would be that the cord could be longer and, more importantly, that it would be nice to have an alarm silence function. The button on the front of the unit only serves as an alarm test button and the only way to silence the alarm is to remove the sensor from the liquid. Also, changing the battery requires a screwdriver."
5,Great insurance investment!,"Because I have had problems with water in my basement, I designed and built an alarm--it works fine. Then I found out about this Sonin and bought one. Theirs looks better and has more features than mine. I have no idea how they can sell their device so cheaply!I'm going to buy two more."
5,Saved us from floods several times,"We have had two of these devices for about six years, and they have saved us from wet carpet etc several times, both when the air conditioner backs up (a regular occurance here on the second floor), and also when the water heater sprang a leak.The alarms we have go off the instant their feet get damp, and are so loud that even our neighbours downstairs can hear them. We have recommended them and even bought them for several of our older friends, just for the added peace of mind they give.I do recommend testing them once a month, to make sure the batteries are still good, but over all a great product and very inexpensive for what they do."
1,Good Idea - Awful quality!,"We got one of these for the basement after our humidifier occasionally leaked all over the floor (about 6 months ago). I'd test it regularly and replaced the battery at least once. Recently, my wife called me at work to say the washer had leaked some water on the floor. When I asked her if the alarm went off (it was located very near the washer and on a downgrade from the washer toward the floor drain), she said it was wet but hadn't alarmed. Later, I replaced the battery and neither water nor the test button generated any alarm. Great idea, but useless if the mean time to failure is so much shorter than that for the devices whose failures you're trying to detect..."
2,Questionable quality alarm,"I ordered two Sonin 00700 Water Alarms. After one month, one of the alarms siren no longer makes sound. The other one still works. I guess you get what you pay for. Cheap product, poor quality."
3,Worked for about 6 years,"Seemed to work for about 6 years, then the alarm sounder pooped out in 2004. It seems to still detect, but it's possible that the dust, dirt and humidity of the basement was too much for the alarm itself. I think I might try the remote - have the sensor in the basement and the actual alarm up somewhere drier and cleaner"
3,"Does its job, no complaints","This is a pretty basic item. Put in the battery, mount the main unit and them position the sensor. It works (I tested it). I wish the battery life was longer (I get about 9 months out of 1 alkaline battery). I haven't seen a better unit, but this is so basic that I just gave it 3 stars."
4,Sonin water alarm,This is my second purchase of this item.The first time was 15 years ago.It has lasted that long.We use it to tell us when water is coming in our basement whenever our sump pump malfunctions.It has a very loud alarm which wakes me up in the middle of the night even in the basement on the other end of my Ranch house.I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with water problems in their basements!!!!
4,Quality Control -- Lemon in the Night,"We own several of these water alarms, having recently purchased three after good experiences with earlier ones. BUT, one of those new purchases is a battery eater -- four new 9v batteries including two of the more expensive long-life types since we put it into service in February. When the battery gets drained, the alarm chirps to let you know -- unfortunately, it's easiest to hear the chirps at night, in bed. And it's hard to know which unit is chirping until you get up, traipse around, and locate the exact source. Now I learn that the return period expired ten days ago. My advice would be to return one of these clunkers as soon as it eats the second battery. The others have lasted over a year before needing a battery replacement. If the seller or manufacturer would like a defective sample to test, I have it right here on my desk..."
1,Poor Quality Control,"I bought this product about 5 years ago and it works great. It's in the basement and is loud enough to hear anywhere on the first floor and in some locations on the second floor.So why the negative review? I bought another in December 2010. It looks identical to the first one but the alarm now sounds like the faint chirping of a cricket. Tried different batteries, same result. OK, well the first one is still working well, I asked Amazon for a replacement. Free return shipping, fast turn around time. I love Amazon. However, replacement alarm has exactly the same problem. You would not be able to hear this thing across a medium sized room unless it was the dead of the night. I don't know what happened to the quality control at Sonin, but I recommend that you look elsewhere. It's more than likely that you'll be sending yours back as well."
3,Great when it works,"The original one I purchased worked (and is still working) great. I subsequently bought several more, which either didn't work right out of the box or -as the one in service that I tested today- lost its alarm volume and is worthless. What a shame- it's a good form but unreliable."
2,SUMP PUMP WARNING,"This unit is poorly designed in USA!!!! built overseas....The alarm is about half as loud as a smoke detectorThe two screws that you must undo to install the battery ( 9V) are different lengths and if you put the short one into the longer's hole it is very difficult to get out.Seems to detect water fine so I will keep- I hate returning. BUT,more loud alarms are available for the same price"
1,Doesn't quite fit,"The case I got was nice, but it didn't quite fit right...the cover needs to wrap around the end of flip-out cover instead of providing a flimsy elastic band that only goes around it. The result is that the entire cover slides up the back side of the phone and buttons end up being covered up by the case in all the wrong places."
5,A must read for all especially in health care,"I'm a student nurse and bought this book for a class I'm taking. It was an amazing read! I may not have agreed with all of her points considering the medical advances that have been made and changes that have occured since the original was published, maybe in part due to Audre. It's a very candid take on living with cancer through the eyes of the cancer ""warrior."" It is a definate must read for anyone in the medical profession since she brings up several events that stood out concerning her nurses and doctors. She was a black, lesbian, feminist, poet, warrior and she really brought a lot of thought provoking topics into my life."
3,The Cancer Journal,"The Cancer Journal by A. Lorde is a rambling tale of how Ms. Lorde felt when she was being treated for cancer. I was disappointed because the details were missing regarding her relationships at that time. I wanted more details from this prolific self proclaimed black warrior. This book does not portray her as a warrior but rather as a baffled women fighting cancer. I understand the lack of coherence, I too had the battle with breast cancer, however this is not a book of support. This is a book about losing the battle."
3,Striking continuation of food-fest/allegorical galcommentary,"Following on the tremendously sensual roast-beef scene in Zami, Lourde here rejects beef after coming to terms with the oppressive white system that probably imposed hormone-ridden substandard products on people of colour. I think this is very brave. I'd like to propose that in memory of Lourde all self-respecting womyn reject mass-produced beef products. A great book. And very eye-opening."
3,"I love Saberhagen, but this is not his best...","Fred Saberhagen is a terrific writer, but this book is not a good example of his capabilities. Though there is some character and plot development, it is often agonizingly slow. Toward the last third of the book, it does pick up the pace a bit. Worth a read if you like the Berserker series, but don't set your expectations up very high."
4,A Berserker Rollercoaster,"An exhilirating thrill ride in an exotic setting. This is a great Berserker book. The middle of the book dragged some, but it was worth it with the revelation of one of the Milkpail nebula's big mysteries, and the heartpounding extended climax when the man, Niles Domingo, finally goes head to head with his long sought after arch enemey, the Berserker Leviathan. Not to mention a shell-shocking surprise ending. What a rush!Oh yeah, there's even a subtle but very meaningful implied connection to another Berserker book discovered toward the end. Exactly the kind of thing I love about the Berserker series.Get your hands on this one if you can!"
3,great show,I would like this show better if they would make the whold set available for me to buy .I want it abailable to bring home.
5,Another Great USA show,"USA networks is hitting shows out of the ballpark and this is another example of that. Monk, In Plain Sight, Burn Notice, and now this great show. Not just another medical drama, in true USA style it has a fun and unusual twist. Very enjoyable to watch. Welcome back to episodic TV Mark Feuerstein. I have always enjoyed his work and this is another great example of his sweet and unconventional sexy style."
2,Too shiny and pretty,"I stopped watching Royal Pains; plots predictable, character development not forthcoming and sidekick brother too 'not bright' and smarmy. It's a pretty and shiny series with not much meat. Went back to watching ""Law and Order"" reruns and the new ""Chicago Fire"". I like genuine characters--who risk their lives protecting people, who grapple with serious ethical and moral conflicts. I like real heroes."
2,all you get,there is only time for the intro (on every episode) so you don't know if the episode is worth watching...or buying. go to hulu or convince amazon to give a 5 minute teaser.
1,Yuck!,Despite all the jibberishyou hear about how great this band is and how 'cool' Hakuei is...is't rubbish! THey sound really really off. The vocals isn't even in tune with the music half the time. The only thing i can think of it that you're better off buying something by Pierrot. Either Private Enemy of Finale.
4,Kate sings!!,"In this production of the 1969 musical, ""Coco,"" we hear Katharine Hepburn singing for the first time. Yes, she doesn't have the greatest voice, and it might take some getting used to for non-Hepburn fans, but I still enjoyed her voice. One of my favorite songs on the album was not sung by Hepburn and it's ""A Brand New Dress,"" - quite beautiful. The sound quality at times on this CD isn't the greatest; however, if you're a diehard Hepburn fan like I am, you won't be severly dissapointed to add this to your Kate collection."
2,A Collectors Item for Kate Hepburn fans,"This was the only Broadway musical Katharine Hepburn did. The reviews were scathing except the critics adored Hepburn and also had nice to things to say about Cecil Beaton's Chanel-inspired costumes.As for the songs, the score by Andre Previn gives new meaning to the word bland and these are probably the worst lyrics Alan Jay Lerner wrote (ex: ""what a coup, what luck/tell the bank to send a truck"" or ""a woman is how she loves/what makes her an aphrodite/isn't the way her nightie flows""). As for Katharine Hepburn's singing...it is not fair to compare her with say Julie Andrews or Ethel Merman but she does give each song her own inimitable style (and vocal mannerisms) and it is easy to understand how her star power was able to attract sellout crowds depite the type of devastating reviews that would have closed most musicals the first weekend."
2,Forgetable,"I did not see the show, but the music & lyrics seem to me quite dull and with no tunes to remember. Besides, who had the bad idea to suggest Katharine Hepburn to sing? She sounds AWFUL, as if someone were pinching her eyes with hot scissors! I guess they tried to do something similar to Rex Harrison's ""singing"" in MY FAIR LADY which was quite sucessful, but this time the strategy did not work. By far, it's one of the most unfortunate singing (or howling?) appearances of a dramatic actress in a B'way show."
2,Singing lessons please!,"You'd think Alan Jay Lerner, famed lyricist of such shows as ""My Fair Lady""and ""Camelot""would work on an exceptional show. But with ""Coco"", it's definitely NOT the case. No gripping songs, no great performances which is extremely surprising due to the fact that George Rose and Rene Auberjoinois were in the cast. Hepburn can't sing so natually the songs aren't pleasant to listen too. But still, if you're a musical collector put it on your list. It's still one of those must have flops."
3,Coco-A True Collectors Item,"If you enjoy obscure Cast Albums, ""Coco"" is a good place to start. If you are being introdued to musicals, ""Coco"" is to be avoided. The score is wonderful, containing some lovely ballads (That's the Way You Are, Let's Go Home) and some lively comedy numbers. When Hephburn appears on the recording, you should probally warm up to her voice before skipping a track. If you do you can discover some wonderful musical numbers.Sound quality is sporatic on this disc. The record (originally produced by ABC Records) has a general ""boxy"" sound. There is a little hiss and crackle. The first track sounds like the man is singing through an antique radio. This is probally used to indicate a flashback scene, because he appears again with the same sound.Overall, if you like lesser known musicals, Coco is a good choice. If you are being introduced to obscure musicals, start somewhere else. If you are a collector, ""Coco' would be a wonderful addition to your collection."
3,pretty good,"This shelf is nice so you can get vegies a bit further from the heat, but it makes working on the main shelf a bit awkward."
2,"Good movie camera, worthless for still pictures","The camera works fine for movies and it is a gread widget as DVD and DVD-RAM writer, SD card reader/writer, etc.However as a still picture camera it is a useless crap.If a medium or darker object appears at the front of a bright background, like a mountain with white clouds behind or an object at the front of a white wall, then that object will be outlined with a thick black pencil.THE RESULTING PICTURE IS WASTE OF THE STORAGE."
4,I finally figured this thing out 7 years late,I bought this 7 years ago and hated it for the crappy software and instructions on how to get the files off of a DVD-RAM. I quit using it several years ago. I am getting all our home movies on a file server to watch from a Mac Mini hooked up to the TV. I had several DVD-RAM disks that had video that I had never taken off the disk. Turns out it is easy. Here is how you do it. Find the largest VRO file on the disk and copy it to your PC or Mac. Change the extension to .mpg. PC's will recognize the file and play it fine. Mac's won't with QuickTime. What you need to play it is VLC Media Player on a Mac. You can download it free at: [...]/ In a matter of minutes I was able to get the images playing on my PC and my Mac.DO NOT load the software that came with it. It will mess up your DVD drivers on your PC.I am finally going to get some more use out of this thing I paid about $900 for 7 years ago.
5,The human side of quality.,"William Glasser has given us the human side of quality as framed by Dr. W. Edwards Deming. This is an excellent companion to the works of the great qualilty guru who was instramental in jump-starting the Japanese economy after WW2, and launching Toyota on its way to overtaking Chrysler, Ford, and maybe GM. Every manager should have a copy of this book sitting next to ""The New Economics"" to provide the means and motivation to spur one into transformation of self, of group, of company. Continual improvement has no end. It does not matter where you start, it matters when. Start NOW. These books will say why and how."
2,Out of date and out of relevance,"I loved his book on Control Theory and was hoping for more of the same, but it appears he has moved away from quality and toward some misguided mass media appeal.It was almost as bad as Choice Theory."
3,My feelings are mixed,"I have mixed feelings about this DVD. It is an intense and effective workout, but Bob seems almost mean or taunting throughout the video. It seems the more I do the DVD, the more I notice this.There is a nice variety of moves, incorporating both cardio and strength aspects. There are A LOT of dumbbell swings which really make my hamstrings sore, and I'm talking soreness for at least four days. I don't mind muscle soreness usually because it means something positive for my body, but four days is excessive. So while I feel this DVD is effective, it's just not something that I want to do often."
4,I love Bob..but pretty hard,"I love Bob Harper. I did this video and was super out of breath and very sore the next day. You can really feel this workout and it is a challenge. I wouldn't recommend this for those who are just starting out. I would say intermediate to advanced. Work your way up to this video because it takes endurance! Overall, I really like the workout and the video."
2,ehh no,"Ok Bob is surely a nice guy and the workout would have been fine but seriously 2 of the three people doing the workout are cheating on the moves and Bob who's a trainer isn't correcting them. The guy in the back has bad posture through nearly the entire thing I mean bad his back looks like an arched bridge and I'm standing there waiting for Bob to say ""so see his back; this isn't how we do it unless we want to get injured straighten up"" Nope nothing he said nothing. he did corrected the tiny girl who was doing the moves right for stopping for a second which honestly isn't as important as making sure the people doing the workout at home aren't going to hurt themselves. I don't like Jillian M. but at least she corrects her people on camera and you can say to yourself oh crap I was totally letting my knee come out to far and you can self correct. This isn't worth the money in my opinion. The firm videos at target are just as hard of a workout and they are around $9 and I sweat more."
3,good but hard on the knees,I was pregnant when I got this and I wanted a change up from my Jillian Micheals DVDs so bob was the obvious choice. He does a LOT of squating so you better have good knees to use this DVD
4,Makes you sweat!!,"If you want to KILL IT, and get an intense sweaty work out in, this series of Inside out is what you want! I love this workout, and the strength and yoga warrior dvd's in the series as well! My little brother couldn't even keep up with me!!!"
4,Good Workout Video,"The half-hour workout contained in this DVD is fair, but the hour-long workout is very good...if you're looking for a tough workout, that is. I was sore for a week after completing the hour-long workout, which was very surprising since I exercise every day. The hour-long workout ranks right up there with Jari Love and Jillian Michaels. The only downside to the DVD is that Bob's cueing isn't great and it's hard to stay in time (even his in-studio participants can't stay synchronized)."
2,The workout I hate to hate...,"I love Bob. I think he's inspiring and a very well rounded trainer. That being said, I hated every minute of this workout. I hate to always compare Bob vs Jillian- but I'll take on of her DVD's over this series anyday. I look for challenging workouts, but this is just painfully repetative. I don't understand why he didn't incorporate different exercises than kettle swings...over and over and over. I couldn't believe it. Some people might enjoy this DVD because when it's done- you know you've gotten a workout. I try to enjoy and have fun, while pushing myself. This DVD I kept looking at the clock, waiting for it to be over! Also, the people in the workout video were terrible. If I can keep up the pace- so can these people. I don't know if they were being over-dramatic or what.. but it was distracting and annoying."
3,Gets the job done but still lacks,"This dvd will get the job done and your heart rate up but not in the way I would prefer. When I think cardio I think a lot of jogging and movement. He focuses way too much on squats. That's not to say squats aren't important because they are but he spends half of the dvd doing them. I don't want to work my legs, I want to work my heart. I would have loved more variety than squats and arm swings. Feels more like strength training which is a bit much for a cardio dvd considering his other one is dedicated to strength training.If you want to save yourself some money do 30 minutes of squats and 30 minutes of jumping then you have a good idea of what this dvd is like. The rest of the inside out method series is pretty good though."
3,GREAT Workout - NOT fun,"I have most of Bob and Jillians workout DVD's. This is by far the most difficult. I feel that it is an hour well spent and feel like I have literally ""climbed a mountain"". I workout 5 days a week and consider myself intermediale/advanced. I do not have 1 hour every day to work out so therefore I will only do it once or twice at most a week. Also, please be careful with the amount of weight used on the kettle type swings. Start out slow, as I injured myself the first time and had to not do it for a couple of weeks. I agree with another review - It is not fun and very repetitive so that may also be another reason I will only do it once or twice a week. I try to do different workouts every day so this will be one of my long days. I recommed it with a Please be careful warning."
3,It's Ok,"I like Bob Harper, the work out is tough. But I was looking for just cardio.Its a little repetitive which really bugged me."
3,Feel the burn!,"I was so happy when Bob came out with this workout! I really wanted a challenge (like Jillian Michaels). Lets just say I couldn't workout for a week because my legs hurt so bad! It does make you sweat, but I could only do a half hour of this workout. I think it's a good workout, but it is a little much. Geezzz Bob..."
4,Another great workout with Bob...,"I found that I like this workout much more than Bob's Pure Burn Super Strength. However, I found the dead lifts and squats very redundant in this video; it seems like you are doing them over and over again and it gets boring. This workout does use weights, kind of like Bob's portion of Biggest Loser Cardio Maxx. Bob is more easy going in this video that the Super Strength one, but not his old likeable self in the Biggest Loser videos. The hour long portion gives you a great, sweaty workout. The 20 minute video is more of a focus on glutes and balancing, not nearly as advanced as the longer workout. I would definately recommend this workout, but know that at times, it does get a bit boring and you may need to motivate yourself to push through it."
2,Not so great,"I own and have used several TBL series workout DVD and most of Jillian's so I though I had some idea of what to expect. I was totally wrong but not in a good way. This workout is EXTREMELY repetitive and boring. Also, it is my believe that swinging free weights many, many, many times is not in your neck's best interest. The one thing can't stand in a workout DVD is a wimpy fitness model and this has one. I don't like the ones who wear fake smiles the entire time but this girl was sad. Wish I could return this DVD>"
3,Can We Do Any More Squats?!?!?!,"I would say I'm in pretty good shape. I just completed the 60 day Insanity DVD's with Shaun T, so I am used to high intensity cardio workouts. This made me sweat and it was a hard, good workout, but it was boring and too repetitive. About 75% of the DVD was spend doing squats....I know squats are good for you, but there are a LOT of other exercises you can do out there that makes a routine less boring! Also, when the guy in the middle was either not doing the exercise correctly or very half heartily, Bob would say ""Good job"" to him. I found that to be annoying, you need to correct what people are doing THEN tell them good job. Luckily I did not buy this DVD and just rented it from the Library."
2,repetitive and dull,"I was really looking forward to gettjng this dvd, and put it in the same day I received it. I couldn't even finish the workout, it was so boring. The moves were very repetitive and dull. Yes, I felt like I got a workout, but I didn't find Bob Harper to me the least bit motivating. I quit halfway through the workout, and have not touched the dvd since. So this one is just collecting dust, and I doubt if I'll ever give Bob Harper another shot."
5,Good workout,"This is a tough, heart pumping workout. I definitely recommend his DVDs. When I first starting using him, I couldn't finish it completely and that is always a sign of a good workout."
3,Its a good workout,"This is a good workout. It gets you sweating and Bob is a motivating and likeable guy. All in all, I would say its a bit harder than P90x plyo. But why is it? It's not the moves that make it tough, its the high reps. Insanely high reps. It's just a very repetitive and extremely grueling video.I guess it depends on what you're after. If you don't mind 'grinding it out' because all you care about is getting a great workout, feeling your heart exploding, and sweating your face off, then you'll love the challenge of this video. But if you prefer a well laid out plan, countable reps, and a laid back teacher, then I recommend P90x.Like I said its a great workout - regardless of my complaints. As a fan of P90x, I use this video about once a week to mix things up."
3,"Effective, But Boring","Sure, it's effective; swinging a heavy weight back and forth for an hour is bound to be. But after the first couple of times doing it, the whole thing becomes so repeptetive and boring that it's hard to stay motivated. For me, it's just as important for a workout to be fun as it is for it to be challenging. I recommend The Firm 500 Calorie Workout as something that manages to be both."
3,"Great, but...","First of all, I love Bob Harper. Second, I've had this DVD for a few months now, and have hesitated to review it. I'm in pretty good shape, run three to five days a week, lift a day or two, a day of power yoga. The first two times I did this DVD, I thought I was going to die and stopped at the halfway point. Now I've gotten to the point that its *almost* easy (simply because of muscle memory). However, EVERY time I've done this, I've had horrible back pain the next day. I stretch, am pretty sure that my form is dead on, and I'm not a new exerciser. I even take glutamine for muscle recovery afterwards. I have no back issues. So if you have any pre-existing back issues, I wouldn't touch this with a ten foot pole. If you want a good cardio workout and can deal with walking like a hunchback for a day or so afterwards, have at it. I really do love this DVD, but am not the biggest fan of icing my back."
2,Too long,"I ordered both of Bob's workouts and I thought they were both too long and redundant. He has a really aggressive atitude in these workouts, not the nice guy he is on BL, but it felt very forced to me. I did sweat, but there are many other workouts that make me sweat which I also find fun and engaging."
4,I love Bob!,"I've done P90X, worked it at the gym, and have sweated my body weight worth of water at hot yoga; this is tough! The first time I put this DVD in, I picked a weight that was too much. My back hurt for 2 days. I popped it in tonight and finished it. This is a tough tough workout. I would absolutely recommend this video to anyone who doesn't have time to make it to the gym."
4,Sweat it out!,"This dvd was more challenging than I thought it would be. I got my heart rate up and worked up a sweat. I think it's funny that Bob even admits he doesn't do the exercises himself in the dvd, because it's too challenging to do that and instruct on the moves. I think it's a great workout. It is VERY fast-paced so if you fatigue easily you will want to ease into it for sure. There is a difficult push-up sequence included in the workout. This workout is all about keeping your heartrate up and you get no breaks in achieving that goal. It definitely did that for me, so mission accomplished!"
3,Good Workout but Becareful if you have BackTrouble,"This is a good, challenging workout but be careful if you have lower back issues. My lower back can be ""tweeky"" due to an injury several years prior. (I workout 4-6 times week, yoga, running & weight training.) After doing the hour workout my back was sore for two days. I liked the 20 minute routine but will stick with other cardio options for longer workouts."
5,Hard Workout,"I never know when ordering exercise videos how they're going to be, usually they're not as difficult as I like. When I exercise, I like to sweat, and most exercise videos don't do that for me. However, this one does. This video is very hard. It starts out slowly, not too difficult then gradually works up to a whole lot of difficult. Then it slows down a little, to help you recover then it starts with the difficulty all over again. It lasts an hour, which is my ideal time for a workout and has a countdown of time while you're working out, which I like. And, I was sore for days afterwards. Now, thats a good video to me. It shows the people doing the workout having a hard time, whether or not that's actually true, I don't know. But it is a good video. I did sweat alot so I'm very pleased."
5,No Nonsense Workout!,"I have been exercising for years & very little is a challenge however I was pleasantly surprised at this workout. It really get your heart rate up & does have you in a ""pool"" of sweat. I can't wait for Bob to release another one that is equally as challenging. What an awesome trainer!"
2,Very Good Cdrws,Good overall except it's hard to write anything on. the grid on the discs are not straigh lined (semi circle) so it makes the disc look not too neat once you write something on. i have burned 10+ discs(Audio&Data) and everyone of them is flawlessly done. very satisfied.
4,Keep an eye on CD-R prices,"I've used the Khypermedia CD-R's for data, photo, and music storage --without any problems.However, 50- and 100-packs of CD-R's are frequently on sale or available with [promotional offers]. Any major manufacturer will satisfy most CD-R needs."
5,EXCELLENT CD BOYZ,I thought that the album was tha bomb! Keep up the good work. Hope the IMX cd is just as good Please write to me is possible. Thanx
5,I'ts the best cd I've heard so far,I love Immature I've been to 3 concerts and went to the skatting rink to see them when they came to Detroit and from what I heard they like comming here so I'm glad I live here. I love them so much that one time they came all these girls and I chased the bus and they stoped and I took a picture of they maneger Chris Stokes and they let us on the bus and my friends and I got to give them a kiss and hug. The first time that they came these girls pulled romeo off the stage. I think Romeo is the cutesit.I love them.
4,IMMATURE IS TRUELY TALENTED,"I LOVE IMMATURE BUT THEY DIDN'T GET MUCH FEEDBACK FROM THIS CD.dON'T GET ME WRONG BUT,"" WE GOT IT"" THE CD IS THE BEST CD THAT THEY EVER CAME OUT WITH THEY WERE SO TIGHT BUT THEY WENT JUST A LITTLE DOWN HILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HOPE THE NEXT CD WILL BE BETTER THAN ""THE JOURNEY"" HOWEVER I STILL LOVE ALL OF THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Uhhh?!!!,"This whole entire cd except for track 1 S****! It's just horrible, the whole cd is saying ""MY HEART IS BROKEN"" it's like, COME BACK!!!!, why did you leave me? Oh girl i love you? MY LIFE ISN'T WORTH ANYTHING WITHOUT YOU. When i see you girl it makes me feel so good, and when you leave my heart is broken! COMPLETER BULS***. The only reason track 1 is good is because it has Bizzy Bone (of Bone Thugs N Harmony) and doesn't express the same concept as the subjects listed above. THe Name of the song is 'Give up the ghost'"
2,MISSING!!!,"I do not know what happened with this album. It seemed like they lost their formula on this one from the style of music to their looks on this album (What was up with the Retro Beatles thing) I did not like this album at all. The only song that I liked was Give up the Ghost with Bone. This cd is when Immature lost a majority of their audience because we all grew up and it seemed like they didn't really mature. Even their brother group B2K seems way more mature now especially with their new single BUMP, BUMP, BUMP!"
5,I LOVE U,I LOVE IMMATURE I MISSED THERE CONCERT THAT WAS AT THE ARENA RIGHT AT THE CORNER FROM MY HOUSE I WAS SO MAD!!!!BUT IM OVER IT NOW!I LOVE IMMATURE SO MUCH THER SO CUTE!I REALLY LIKE ROMEO CAUSE HE HAS THE SAME B-DAY AS ME OCT.25!!!!!OH WELL GOTTA BOUNCE >>PEACE OT!
5,I LOVE THIS CD,"WUZ UP TO ALL YOU IMMATURE FREAKS OUT THERE. WELL ANYWAY I'M ALSO A IMMATURE LOVER. MY NAME IS NAY-NAY BUT MOST PEOPLE CALL ME LITTLE TEKKEN. WELL ALL OF THERE SONGS ARE BOMB BUT I REALLY LIKE ""EXTRA EXTRA"" AND ""TAMIKA"" MAN THOSE SONGS ARE THE ONES I THINK EVERY BODY SHOULD LISTEN TOO. WELL I'M BOUNCING UP OUT."
4,Not as good but still the bomb!!,"This CD is the bomb! it did't do as good as the last one, cuz it wasn't as good. I'm an Immature Fan 4 life. I'm not saying anyone's wrong, cuz everyone thinks diferently, but that's my opinion"
3,"Good, but not the good old Immature style","Despite all of the reviews in all capital letters saying this is the best album ever, this is a mediocre album. Almost all of the somgs are balads, most of them coming one after the other. This makes for a rather uninteresting track selection. It lacks the bubble-gum pop style that made the previous albums so fun to listen to. It is like listening to an entirely seperate group."
3,They could of did better,I think the Journey isn't really bad but they could of did better than what they did.
4,Beautiful... but brief,"The images in this small book are beautiful photographs of modern burlesque dancers, but I was really hoping for more information than is provided in the very very brief section at the back of the book. Could've done better..."
3,Not bad,"This book is a good intro but lacks depth or a well rounded view. It is fine for what it is, but look elsewhere for expanded pictures or interviews, etc."
3,"Seller was great, book was ok",I didn't read any of the reviews or descriptions on the book so I didn't realize it was just pictures.
3,was helping a friend out,"She doesn't have a computer so she was using mine, once she gets it will have to have her re-rate."
5,Oustanding,"This is an outstanding DVD. Norah is at her best. The sound is great, the photography phenomenal. In my opinion, this is one of the very best concert DVDs out there, period. And for Norah fans it's good beyond hope."
4,Wierd band members,"Norah is great in the concert, however theres a few picky things that I found annoying. Her band is really annoying, dont get me wrong they can play their instruments alright, but they get really annoying to watch. The guitar player especially. Also in a bunch of songs the entire band did not need to play, however no one was left out, so there are extra musical parts that are extremely unneccesary and actually make the songs worse. Example, The long way home would have been 100 times better if it were Norah alone on the guitar. Also the girl with flute and backup vocals is so unnecesary, she stands there 80 percent of the time looking afraid. And whos that Grandpa??? Also the venue they selected to film this sucks. It looks like the inside of a church or something in NASHVILLE. I probably sound negative, but Norah was good in it. Try the New Orleans DVD."
5,Not everyone is Cher. Let us give thanks.,Norah is just Norah on this dvd and that is way better than 99.9% of the singers doing concerts and/or dvd's at the moment. There is not a single lightning flash or even a smoke grenade. It is just Norah and a terrific group of musicians doing what they do so well.I found no problems with the sound (referred to by others) on my 6.1 system. First-rate purchase imho.
1,Jazeps,"this is the vorst video (from the two 2003 year dvd and 2004 year dvd) - because there are not the best hits, ""come away with me"" and others, and the video is teken withot taste (bad video operator and editor work), it is not great pleasure to watch, not like dvd from 2003 year. the band plays very good, but their behavior did not fascinate me, it seems to bee too artifical. the bad thing is that both video are in very poor quality, video compresion makes it impossible to get good sight when loked on big tv, or projected on the wall. so, i am a big fan of the old dvd, and highly recomend it - (""live in new orleanes 2003""). i just bought both because they were cheap:)sory for my weak english:)"
3,Technically inferior to the last DVD,"Norah's last DVD, from a performance in New Orleans, was visually stunning and an audiophile's dream (if a bit heavy on the bass). This DVD is grainy, occasionally out of focus, and has a decent, but not great, sound (no DTS)."
5,Awesome keychain that converts into a backpack,"This is an amazing item for the price...first, it does what it advertises. It really does open into a small backpack or bag and fits back into a key chain. It is great for traveling...I use it as a gym bag or to carry extra items and souvenirs when traveling. I recommend buying this product."
4,"Excellent bag for carrying light items, packs up very small","We've carried this little bag all around the world with us. It's the perfect thing to clip onto another bag for extra on-the-fly carrying storage needs, and it makes a great light day bag if you're only carrying a few light items.But, the straps start slipping if you put anything heavy in it. We spend all day pulling on them to tighten them back up. You can tie a knot in the strap if this bugs you. All in all, a great little handy item to bring on any trip."
5,"If you travel, it is a must!","I had found a product similar to this several years ago and I loved it so much, I have been searching to buy another. I found this and I bought one for myself and one for a Christmas present for a friend that also loves to travel. It is compact and light weight and expand out to hold a lot when it is needed! It can be used as a backpack once it is full and helps you to stay hands free! When it is not full it can hang from your belt, your keys, your purse, etc."
2,"Shoulder Strap Buckles Failed, First Use","Small size is impressive and convenient. Took it overseas on vacation. Put 3 bananas and 2 apples inside, put on my back and both adjustable straps slipped out of the buckles. Readjusted, made certain the strap locks were locked, and straps slipped again. Disappointing. Can secure straps if you tie a knot in the straps at the buckle, at the desired length. Be aware that the plastic molded buckles on the shoulder straps do not work as intended, even with very little weight. It is very small and lightweight. Have used at the market about 7 times and it is still holding up well."
4,Not perfect but good for what it is.,"You simply get a tough, lightweight, smallish backpack to fold into a keychain sized pouch, so if you are looking for more than that, go elsewhere. BUT should you want a handy little bag you ca take everywhere and pull it out when you need it, this bag is GREAT. It was recently indispensable when travelling and we rented mopeds- I threw everything I needed in there and had my hands free. Note the straps are lightweight- almost like ribbons, and they adjust, but don't always stay put! I also bought the tote but end up using this all the time. Overall, a unique product that's worth it."
4,Pretty cool!,This is a pretty amazing little pack that I bought specifically because of it's small size when folded up so I can take it on a trip to Ireland in the fall and have extra luggage space on my return trip to bring back some Irish goods! The only thing negative would be that it is a little tricky to figure out how to re-fold it into it's little pouch.
4,Best Bang For The Buck !,"If you are looking for an MP3 player/FM Radio, this is the ideal choice. It is packed with features and it delivers on every one of them. The FM radio reception is very good, as is the sound quality of the MP3 playback. The software is uncomplicated with no proprietary foolishness often found in Sony products. A full compliment of accessories is included (carrying case, neck strap, in-line recording cable, USB direct connector, and USB cable for general use).The included sound bud headphones are adequate but could be improved upon. I have trouble keeping them in my ears. Also the physical connection for the USB cable needs to be improved (particularly the rubber cover) in terms of mechanical durability.Overall, it's long time run on CNET.COM's ""Most Popular List"" is well deserved !"
2,Battery cannot be replaced; throw player away,I was pleased with the versatility and sound quality of this player. Loading music and playback were good. I listened to the radio and it had a recorder I didn't use much. My negative is that the rechargable battery cannot be replaced. When the battery goes south the device is worthless. Internet comments confirm this complaint. It lasted about two years before tanking. What a waste.
2,Didn't work...twice,"I opened my first one, charged it and then tried to turn it on but it didn't work. After spending 10 minutes trying to get it to turn on I eventually gave up and shipped it back to Amazon. My second one worked for about a month and then began to lock up when I would charge it. Unfortunately, it's out of the 30 day return policy for Amazon and so I'm going to have to deal with iAudio to get this one fixed."
1,Stay AWAY!,"Okay, unless you are a computer guru and know the difference between wav. and mp3 formats, this product IS NOT for you. The user manual is an absolute joke. It tells you nothing in ten languages. For 20 more bucks get the IPOD mini. I HATE this product and it's company. Good luck catching these geeks on the phone or over the internet. NOT a user frinedly item AT ALL."
4,First Blush Performance,"I've had this unit for just a couple of weeks and I'm not a dedicated, multiple-hour per day user. But I can add a few bits of information. The initial ""buttonology"" takes a little while to catch onto owing to the fact that the unit has multiple capabilities and relatively few buttons to recall them. After a little practice, maneuvering becomes pretty easy. Love the screen data. Lots of information, relatively easily presented in a very small space. Sound is very good and adjustable. Belt clip and unit protector is adequate, but not outstanding. Overall, a little pricy, but worth the addition to avoid the IPOD Shuffle ""load it and lose it"" approach. I prefer to have more control and this gives it to me. Loading and arranging music is easy, virtually effortless. I look forward to still more improvements in the genre in the future. BJ"
1,DO NOT BUY!!! COMPLETELY DIED AFTER FIRMWARE UPGRADE,"DO NOT BY THIS PRODUCT!!! THE UNIT COMPLETELY DIED AFTER I TRIED TO UPGRADE THE FIRMWARE. (IT IS LESS THAN 6 MONTHS OLD). THE UNIT NO LONGER TURNS ON, AND IS NO LONGER RECOGNIZED BY WINDOWS XP WHEN PLUGGED INTO A USB PORT. COWON TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR THIS PROBLEM WAS DISMAL. THEY SUGGESTED I TRY RELOADING THE FIRMWARE!!! I COULD NOT HAVE MADE IT MORE CLEAR IN MY POST THAT THE UNIT SHOWS NO SIGNS OF LIFE, AND IS NOT RECOGNIZED BY ANY HARDWARE DETECTION PROGRAM WHEN PLUGGED INTO A COMPUTER. APPARENTLY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCE THE SAME PROBLEM AND HAVE RECEIVED THE SAME IDIOTIC REPLIES FROM COWON TECHNICAL SUPPORT. (SEE, FOR EXAMPLE [...]"
1,wish I could give it a negative star rating,"This mp3 player was a nightmare from beginning to end. After installing the software and the PDF of the manual (the tiny manual that comes with the player is good only for installation and almost useless for performance), I converted some files using their very buggy ""JetAudio"" software and loaded them onto the player.Boy, was that a mistake.I could not select and play the files. On occasion, the player would decide to play a file after I pushed enough random buttons, but never the one I selected and never at very high quality. The annoying, pre-packaged song already on the player played fine, but after locking up several times and forcing me to actually remove and reinsert the battery to get it the player to turn off, I eventually gave up.I'm a pretty savvy electronics and computer person; this was not my first MP3 player. It is, however, my last from IAudio and Cowon. What a piece of junk."
1,Quality control lacking and service below par,"I experienced frequent and unexpected product failures requiring re-loading of firmware and music. I sent the product back for repair/replacement based on IAudio's promise of a 3-day turn-around. A month later, with no follow-up initiated by iAudio, and with a second promise not met (you'll have a replacement express UPS'ed LAST Monday), I am still waiting for the MP3 player. The latest: the CS manager, after frequently interrupting me, said it had been sent ground UPS later than expected and we'd receive it some time next week. To sum it up, the product is poor and the service lacking."
3,Shitty manual,"The player is okay. It hard to read the small lines (even if you have good eyesight). The problem is the manual, it's a very laconic one, and you have to try several combinations and suddenly you found a new feature. What's the use with features that no one knows how to operate?"
3,DOES NOT SUPPORT M3U,"The marketing material all claims support for playlists, specifically m3u files. As of firmware 1.3 4/30/05, that is still an empty promise.Cowon still claims that this will be added in a future firmware release, but they haven't released any updates in ages.Aside from that, it's an excellent player. I would give it 5 stars if it had the m3u support, and 4 stars if the manufacturer wasn't pulling a bait and switch with m3u support."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS-READ MY REVIEW FIRST!!,"I bought one for my son at Christmas and it broke after a month. It just suddenly wouldn't turn on. Amazon was great with sending a replacement in just two days, before even getting the original back. But the replacement model ""froze up"" after just 4 days and this time I am getting a refund. To quote an e-mail from Amazon regarding this product ""As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread thanwe originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement."" So, DO NOT order one!!"
1,Not Ready For Prime-time,"I got the U2 for Christmas and it stopped working by January 6th. I have been reading the COWON forums and it seems that many of their devices, not just the U2, have the same problem. They just stop working off battery power. They work as a USB drive and you can add and delete files from the device but the device will not turn on. COWON tech support is very understaffed right now. It took me a week to get someone on the phone to get an RMA to return my U2. They haven't return my U2 yet so I can't say if the problem is the battery or something else. All I can say is that I see a lot of post about devices not turning on after a few weeks. I would recommend the 2GB iPod Nano instead."
2,Having lots of 'technical' problems with this model,"At first purchasing this item we were in love. It did exactly what it said it would do. Then the battery died. We charged it up on our PC and when we tried to power it back on, nothing happened. It was unresponsive.We sent it back for repair and it did the same thing. We are sending it back again for a 2nd time to see if they can give us our money back or a new unit. We really do love the iAudio line and considering the price and features it is much better than an iPod, but they definitely need to work on what ever this glitch is. I will update this review later with what the final outcome might be."
2,GET AN IPOD INSTEAD!,This gadget worked fine for exactly one year and 6 months. It was used nearly everyday until the on button stopped working. Unfortunately the warranty is only for one year. I bought this when the price was inflated. It should not cost more than 75 bucks for a year and a half of service! if you want a positive review read some of the others.
3,MISERABLE mp3 encoding,"This item has very nice qualities in design, playing and user interface but isMISERABLE in line in recording!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It sounds like an old 64kbps encoder even if you record at 128kbps (maximum)High frequency is totally distorted!!"
3,Decent mp3 player,It's functionally excellent. You do not need special software to put media files in it.The audio is DECENT only. The included headphones suck. The mid to high range is a bit sad no matter what headphones you have attached.
3,iAudioU2,"Easy to use, downloads and records songs. Horrible sound even after trying different earphones. Not willing to try a replacement so I switched to iRiver."
5,iAudio U2 1 GB,"I've been using this product at the gym every day for nearly 5 months and love it. No batteries to worry about, I've got 6 or 7 CDs loaded and can listen to the TVs in the gym on the FM receiver. I use my personal earphones rather than the ear buds provided, because they are more comfortable and the sound quality is better. I would like to see a waistand clip, but I slip it into the pocket of my gym shorts/sweatpants and it works fine and is easily accessable.Great value for the price."
3,"Shuffle play, Shuffle play, Shuffle play ...","All the features are wonderful on this player except for the shuffle play. Cowan released a firmware update that should have solved the problem, but mine still plays the same songs over and over. The radio works great and the sound is adjustable in many ways. The headphones are a little big for my ears but they sound okay."
4,I'm using it constantly,"This thing is awesome! Its the size of a cheap disposable lighter, and it's super easy to use, to the point that I don't even have to look at it to change songs/volume. Much better than the v@mp mp3 player I had. That said, it also has features out the wazoo, with enough sound-shaping controls to make nearly any music sound fantastic on any pair of headphones. The earbuds that came with it, by the way, sound pretty good, but were broken quickly (goofy shape catches on things). I bought a high-quality set of headphones, and the sound is amazing. The battery lasts about three days. I hope it lasts a very long time."
2,Disappointed,"There were not enough color plates/photos for my need.I expected more of a ""How To"" guide.A little misleading"
5,Found several great uses.,"Winter BBQ's just got easier. Nice bright light! I can brush on sauces, check the rotisserie and even monitor the pot on my side burner. Took it camping, made a great night light for reading just clamped it to the pole.. used it for hands free hookup of trailer hitch when we arrived a camp site after dark. Just used the magnet to attach light to rear of truck and bent the gooseneck right where I needed to see to get the tongue off the hitch. Also worked great under the hood of the truck hooking up a voltage converter.Hands free and beats having a ""helper"" who can't hold a flashlight still!used it under the kitchen sink to see to replace our disposal just clamped it to the cabinet door. I also like the fact it uses AAA batteries which last pretty long and are easier to find and replace than those pesky disk batteries found in many LED lights."
2,Attractive Price - You Get What You Pay For Though,I was attracted to this light to the the style and price. Unfortunitally even though it says it is weatherproof it rusted very quickly with rain water and doesn't put out a lot of light for a larger grill. I would suggest spending more on a better light.
5,Great product,"Great product. Works as advertised. BUT, I waited for more than 4 MONTHS for amazon to fill this order. I finally cancelled, googled the item and purchased from another store. I received my lamp from that store in 4 days. This has been my biggest disappointment from amazon."
1,Weather proof - Yes...Waterproof - NO,"I got this light just like everyone else but miss read the box.It states on the outside that it is not waterproof.Rusted, shorted out, fell apartI BBQ all yeay round doing the thanksgiving turkey on the grill and more.Would not buy again.Still looking for the Best BBQ light"
3,BBQ Clamp Lamp,It's just what I was looking for. The only disappointment was I found it in a local store for the same price & it would have saved shipping. Oh well.
1,SACRILEGE!!,"I was asked to do this review by a friend who had inquired as to whether this Video constituted a great religious experience. Unfortunately, I finished viewing this video, obtained from a library, totally unmoved. Despite various venues in and around places associated with Jesus, the vocals from Charlotte Church were about as inspiring as a flat tire. There is a total lack of emotion with this little girl and her range is notibly lacking; especially at the lower octaves. There is an aura of sterility that surrounds her vocalizations. In viewing this video, I feel as if I were listening to vocals which have simply been added to some video shoots without any thought of the congruency between the two. Thus, I remain unmoved by this work which rates no more than a travelogue seen on the travel TV Channel."
1,Disgusting,Ms. Church does not have a good voice at all....which I expected the opposite of according to all the rave reviews I've been hearing from the media.
3,Terrific yet,Over all the concept of this MP3 player is great. It combines FM radio with a MP3 player. However downloading from itunes was a challenge. We found out through trial and error that we had download from itunes onto a CD then transfer to the MP3 player.
3,"Good, but brief.","I believe that most people buy a ""Best of"" title mainly to see some of their favorite skits. Don't set your expectations too high here. This is just 76 minutes long, which includes outtakes, tv interviews, a dress rehearsal, and some recognizable skits. One can always argue about what should be on a ""Best of"", but this is so limited as to leave one convinced that this was made short to allow for other ""Favorites"" to be bundled up by producers for other DVD's to be released later. Disappointing."
3,DVD Best of Doesn't Do Molly JUSTICE,"I would like to know who chooses the 'best' moments for all of these 'best of' collections! This collection for Molly definitely doesn't show a LOT of her funniest moments on SNL. Where is Goth Talk and Dog Show??? I was disappointed, and usually am, when I purchase these 'best of' SNL collections. The only decent ones so far would be that of Will Ferrell (the 1st one) and Jimmy Fallon. It really makes me angry that whoever chooses the skits to put on these DVDs makes some very poor choices. In reading some other reviews, I know I am not alone here.Let ME do the job!!"
3,Solid but incomplete tribute to a great comedienne [3.5 stars],"Saturday Night Live -- The Best of Molly Shannon is a worthwhile look back at Molly's fine stint on the show. Most of Molly's best characters are highlighted (Mary Katherine Gallagher, Sally O'Malley, Veronica) but the show's missing something. As many of the SNL Best Of programs, some of the artists' best, edgiest sketches are left out in favor of safer, sometimes boring material. How did the Dog Show sketches (with Will Ferrell) not make the cut?The DVD ""extras"" are good. Check out Molly's two appearances on Conan. Funny stuff."
1,No Dog Show! No Funny!,"This DVD was pure torture. It made me more and more angry as the minutes ticked by. I was so dissapointed that I wrote this review even though I rented it in the first place. While Shannon was great on SNL, the producers somehow managed to cobble together all of her least funny material for this DVD."
1,Disappointed,"Very disappointed with this collection of Molly Shannon. There were so many more worthy skits she did on SNL. There was only one skit I enjoyed - the Sally O'Malley skit, but it wasn't the best of this series and probably inserted due to Danny DeVito's appearance rather than the quality of the skit.The other skits were just not funny."
3,SNL Molly Shannon,"Of all the sketches featuring Molly, I think they could have picked out better ones for this DVD, but all the same it was worth the money, and I surely laughed through the DVD."
4,"All because my wife does a great ""Helen Madden"" ""Mary Catherine Gallagher"" and ""Sally O'Malley""...","I bought this for my wife last Christmas. She LOVES the above-mentioned characters and does great impressions of them. I have to say the take off of NPR with the Christmas ""Schwetty Balls"" is still one of the funniest SNL sketches I've ever seen. And sad to say that the DVD's last skit about dating was not one of the sketches I would have included. They should have replaced it with another one with Mary Catherine Gallagher. Don't get me started. ...Don't even get me started! But there is no doubt, Molly Shannon is one VERY funny woman (and so is my wife)!"
3,I wouldn't call it the BEST of...,"This dvd was OK. They had a couple mary catherine sketches; not the funniest ones, but they were alright. The rest of the sketches were kind of funny too. If you buy this dvd expect some warm tingly feelings or a slight giggle, but no loud chuckles here. If you really want the best of molly shannon, buy the Superstar dvd instead."
3,It is ok...,"I thought they would include funnier sketches Molly Shannon is hillarious and I am sure they could have included other skits...it is not complete, if you have SNL recorded on VHS or something then dont buy this...like some one else wrote if you want the best of Molly, buy Superstar!!!"
2,cold and dark,"this music is very cold, and dark. it's drum and bass obviously but I didn't care for it much.. it's inhuman, and lifeless yet rhythmically accurate. I can't imagine the kind of person that would really ""get into"" this music, but I'd have a hard time believing that they were anything other than evil."
3,Not What I Thought,"I was looking to upload photos from an older Sony camera that used the regular Memory Stick. I was unaware there was a difference, but this does not work for my card."
5,"High Quality, Great Price!","When the USB mini port on my PSP went kaput, this was the onlyalternative I had in mind. Sandisk never fails to amaze me athow easy this dongle worked! Now I able to freely transfer games,music, photos, and movies easily with this easy to use reader.I highly recommend picking it up!"
3,Scandisk Micromate Reader,Each time I try to use it I get an error saying there is disk error and do I want to contiue or try to repair it. I have chosen repair about 4 times and still get the error. So I now choose continue as is. It seems to copy all the photos except sometimes 1-2. Maybe the fault is actually in my camcard. Not sure because I don't have a second reader. Both are new.
2,Read the description. I got the wrong one,"There are several versions of these Sandisk readers the one i got was a Memory Stick PRO Duo but i was looking for the Sandisk MicroMate for SD. they look the same and the posts are very simmilar, but in the discription one says SD and the other PRO Duo. Another draw back of this item is the sizeis its HUGE. once inserted it covers half of my other USB slot and firewire port on my Laptop."
4,Shipped wrong Product,They shipped me the wrong product and untill I shipped them the wrong one back they would not ship the right one
1,Whereeeeee are you? Where-Where-Where-Where?,"I wanted a card reader for my brand new camera's memory stick pro duo. I had a Sandisk thumb drive which worked well, so I thought I would try this product. It had cost around US$18 at the time, and was sold by a third party. A month later and I had yet to see it. The online tracker said that it was delivered. My delivery service said they never got it. My other items (different seller) ordered the same day arrived on time without incident. I don't know where the chain of possession broke down, but in the end, my delivery service credited my account for the costs.Considering it's priced at less than $5 now, if you live in the US and can get free shipping, and you don't need a multi-in-1, then this would still be a good buy. Plus with Amazon shipping it, you might be luckier than I was with this purchase. :)"
5,fast SD-USB reader,"It works and is faster than what I expected compared to Kingston's USB drives... but I have not done benchmarks. The build and materials doesn't feel cheap, it is more sturdy than SanDisk cruzer's flimzy glider.It looks small, but may not work on all USB ports... it works in those that have a universal design; for more than cables (the 2 ports that I tested worked, but in one it was slightly tilted)."
3,Bigger than i though,"I'm a Sandisk fan, i think is a great brand, when i bought this one, i though it was small enough to carry it in the camera pouch all the tiem, well it fits, the size is like a matchbox, wich is small, but not enough compared to the size the memory stick duo."
2,Not as described,"Bought this to replace heavy steel ramp I use to load motorcycle onto trailer.The 1500# workload is arrived at as each side of ramp (2 pieces) is rated 750#. I don't believe combining them into one piece will double their capacity.Also concerned that the front lips are too long, and will bend or break due to leverage when weight is applied.I will rework their design as I destroyed box getting them out.Additional bracing and work, they may suffice, but the description is misleading, at best."
2,OK but product support sucks!,"I bought this to load my motorcycle on my own. The bifold gives me enough space to walk it up solo. Problem? All the parts to connect the two ramps together weren't included and despite numerous calls to customer support no one could even find the missing parts in their own catalog. I gave up after the 5th call. Also, the ad says 750 lb capacity. Well, my bike weighs 460 lb wet and I weigh 155 lb (total 615 lb) and the ramp bent a little bit in the middle as I walked it up, i.e. has a permanent bend in it. I would not trust it to 700 lb. Buyer be wary. I give it 2 stars since it suits my purposes as it is but heaven help you should you have missing parts or a liter bike!!!!!"
1,returned,"I sent them back without trying them, they have many sharp edges and would be unsafe to use without gloves, I bought two sets planing to have #3000 weight limit, but after seeing them, i was wrong."
4,Sturdy loading ramp for pickup,"This ramp is exactly what I needed. It allows me to load and unload heavier household equipment (generator, lawnmower etc..) when necessary. I don't move this type of equipment on a regular basis but nice to have when needed. It is a little bulkier than I anticipated but I am able to store it along a wall in my garage. It did not come assembled and the instructions were a little vague but I eventually got everything where it belonged."
2,"They got it half right; need to hire ""younger"" software engineers","I was pretty excited when my AV guy told me that there was a product that could not only dock my IPOD but also play the music I have stored in my iTunes on my PC even without the iPod. And, indeed, the Escient FP-1 Music Manager Universal Dock for iPod does just that. Unfortunately, the software appears to have been written by software engineers whose careers were aborted in the days of MS-DOS 3.1 or maybe Windows 95. The software is slow, klugey, non-intuitive and just plain hard to use. The limitations are truly surprising. If you are are used to the flexibility, ease of use, and design of iTunes, you may despair and just stop trying to work with this woefully inadequate software. It's really too bad because the product hardware works pretty well (even if the latency of response is pretty slow). A complete overhaul of the software, not a simple patch, would be imperative for me to consider increasing my rating from 2/5."
1,I agree- this is not worth the money,"I've had this for about a year and a half, and have never been able to get it to work. I have a rack system feeding my house, and phillips pronto remotes, and despite hours of labor for my A/V techs (who I trust know their stuff), we can't get it to work.. it constantly locks up....i have the nuvo system and will get the nuvo wireless ipod dock for when guests are here wanting to play their ipod..otherwise i can play my mac music and control it / view the display throughout the house so don't even need to plug in my personal ipod.. i just play straight from itunes...don't waste your money.."
3,music client,"escient is a great product, i control it with a philips tsu 9600 andrfx 9600, this is a music client, you will need to buy a music server or connect an ipod.i will give a three star because to controll it with the computer web page is very slow. They need to make a software to speed thing up.."
2,Did not engage me.,"THE WASP FACTORY is a decent little novel, but it certainly didn't live up to the expectations I had for it. I didn't find it particularly funny, or horrible. Gross maybe, but not something that conveyed horror or dread. Novels like this depend on the big payoff..the plot twist that astounds, or enlightens the reader..the justification for being subjected to an implausible character or story line. I don't think the payoff was totally successful in the Wasp Factory. I was surprised, but not astounded or enlightened, and it didn't force me to alter my views about the main characters in the book."
2,This is an odd one. . .,"It has been a little while since I have read the book, but I just came across these reviews and had to say something. I do not really get why this book is so lauded. I did not find it particularly offensive, although much of the material did seem to be written for ""shock value,"" I'm not too squeamish about the useless cruelty to animals found in the book. What I do not like about this book is that it has no point. At the end of the book, I do not understand any of the characters; I do not feel any compassion towards the characters. There does not seem to be any ""message"" in the book (which may be a good thing, ham-handed ""messages"" in books are almost as annoying as no message whatsoever). I just have no idea why the author even wrote the book, there seems to be nothing to it, other than a pointless ""shocking"" twist ending. I apologize for the overuse of quotation marks in this review (I try to limit myself to two)."
2,Ultimately unimportant,"Banks' use of language is excellent, his descriptions evocative. The book gets carried away with very detailed accounts of very obsessive violent adolescent behaviors. Some find value in the shocking acts of sociopathy; some are repulsed by them. I am neither: they seemed pointless. I kept reading, because it was my book club's selection and because I hoped to finally get to what was supposed to make the book great. I finished the book but never found its value."
2,"I was warned but read anyways, I am now sorry","I really hate all the subject matter in this book. The end was very lame but there were interesting twists and turns getting there. I put this book down for more than a week when I got to some really disturbing torture descriptions. The writing was interesting and I might enjoy a different kind of book from this author.I burned the book as soon as I finished reading it. I don't want anybody in my family reading it and I don't want anybody in my family knowing I read it. I pass on all my books after I read them. Not this one.If you are sensitive to animal torture, just pass, do not read this book. Some of the images are burned on my brain. Yes, I use the word 'burn' many times, that should give you an idea of what you do not want to read about."
3,One of the hundred best of the century? I think not.,"This book is over-rated. I do not consider myself a squeamish person in the least, but the descriptions of animal torture are deeply disturbing and the rest of the book isn't worth sitting through them for. One can guess the ""punch-line"", if you will, early on, not that one really cares by the time it's revealed in the end. I would probably give this 2 1/2 stars if I could. The narrative of Eric's time in medical school is probably the best part of the book."
1,Gratuitous and predictable,"I figured out the ""surprise"" less than half the way through. The rest is gratuitous violence, like a bad independent film."
2,Too Much Buzz Over A Real Drone,"Although some will tell you that this is a honey of a book, don't get stung. This work rambles on and on and on and on and on and on and on about NOTHING, which is basically the author's prose style. It gave me the hives."
1,ANIMAL CRUELTY!!,I couldn't stand this book. Actually I didn't even get past the second chapter. The constant references to animal cruelty disgusted and disturbed me so much that I couldn't go on. ...
3,"Although well-written and uniquely bizarre, a disappointment","Iain Banks creates a fascinating character in Frank Cauldhame. The demented world that Frank creates for himself and the fact that it is Frank himself who takes the reader into his obsessive compulsive realm, keeps the reader engaged. For me the book fell apart when Frank finally reveals what made his brother Eric go mad. From there on out, Banks lets the reader down in a big way. The overly contrived ending and the patronizing explanations of everything the book has meant insulted and disappointed me. Banks writes well, but I felt he was just ""calling it in"" in the last couple of chapters."
4,"Cool, calm and collected.","That's the only way i can describe the ""hero"" of this novel. He's a sadistic, hopless youth, with no possible future. However, he lives in a dream world of his own creation, where he is in control. No matter what happens to him in his little world, he can handle it.The book is interesting because it challenges mainstream perceptions of things. A disability that few could imagine living with becomes the hero's source of strength. Every event, every piece of dialogue is interpreted completely diffently by the hero and the reader. It is a strange book, but quite rewarding, with a suitably different ending to what you would expect. I can think of no novel similar, and i like that. It's well worth a read."
4,Phenominal Up To the Ending,"Banks's ""The Wasp Factory"" offers an intriguing look into the mind of the marginally deranged. He spins an intricate, envelopping story which has you clinging to his every word. Although Banks reaches out on a limb with a disappointing ending, he does a phenominal job of creating the world his characters live in. Despite the shortcomings of Banks's finale, ""The Wasp Factory"" stays with you long after you put it down."
5,Amazing and excruciatingly funny,"I read The Wasp Factory about two months after it was first published. I loved it as I read it, and was constantly struck by the giggles throughout. The epic battle at the Hunting Grounds and Frank's telephone conversations with his homeward-bound brother were audacious and some of the funniest stuff I'd ever read. Notwithstanding my sick sense of humour, this novel with it's ultimately satisfying conclusion explores issues about gender and socialization, but does so without hitting you over the head with a sledgehammer. May also make you think twice about home schooling! Needless to say, I've snapped up every book written by this imaginative and truly entertaining writer since - every one has been just as satisfying in its own way and has made me eagerly anticipate the next."
2,"A curiosity, nothing more","I read it because it was Ian Banks first novel. If it was the first book of his I had read, I would not read another.The writing itself flows well, and conveys a character. Too bad the character conveyed -- and really all the characters we get any real knowledge of -- is so unsympathetic. There is plenty of ambiguity to keep you reading in hopes of resolving some nagging questions. Ultimately though, it was time that could have been used for other things"
4,CULT CLASSIC,This probably would have been better as a short story or novella - hence sometimes you feel like Banks is padding out as if this was an English assignment. Nevermind.Very good with a great twist that has become a hallmark Banks' novels.Not for animal lovers.
2,It Was Just A Stage...,"I am amazed that this book is purported on the cover to be a ""gothic tale"". It is nothing of the sort. While some of the imagery is excellent and SOME of the humor comes through, I found it lacking. Overall the book simply rambles on about things that we later find have no relevance to the story. Just like any good horror tale, describe a scene once and you ""got me"", describe the SAME thing over and over again and it is nothing but boring. The ""reveal"" could have happened about 1/2 way through the book and then been used to actually further develop the story. Instead, we are punished and dragged through the morass of this tale to a true anti-climax. I give it two, instead of one, stars because of the humurous murder depictions. Other than that, I would not waste my time on this tale. However, at less than 200 pages it is a quick read...thank God."
1,Sick,"Am I the only one who hated this book? It's a grotesque, rambling and ultimately pointless excursion into the minds of a couple of animal-torturing psychotics. I kept reading only the hope that they would both come to a horrible end, but was disappointed even there. There is no deeper meaning or startling insights here. The characters had absolutely no redeeming features and the ending was contrived and resolved nothing. We don't need to read about people like this, there are enough crazies in the real world. It's the second of Banks' books I have read, and will definitely be the last."
4,not bad...not bad at all....,"This book is very eerie and just plain weird. If it were a movie, i think harmony korine would be the perfect director for it.Its well written from the first person POV which forces the reader to see what might normally be considered grotesque and wrong as something normal and sometimes beautiful. I really liked being brought into this persons world (the narrator) and end was QUITE a shocker!"
2,Great book...until the end.,"This book was really great, but fizzled at the very end. To be fair, I can't imagine a better ending, but I didn't try very hard. He's obviously a great writer, but this one fell flat."
1,Decent writing but terrible subjects,"I had to read this book for a class, otherwise I would have put it down after the first page and never looked at it again. The writer is good and I was somewhat interested in the story, but I found the end to be pathetic. There's a random twist and then boom, the book is over and still leaves me with questions about what happens to Frank and Eric and whether or not both of them will be persecuted for the crimes they have committed.What I hated most about this book was the constant brutality against innocent animals since the first page of the book. Is it necessary to have that much violence in one book? It was terrible and I don't understand how this book won any awards at all."
3,Interesting,"Well, that was different. It's a very dark, thoughtful novel. It was hard to read at times, but it certainly does make you wonder how serial killers and psychopaths spendt their childhood days. If you can manage to get through this book, the ending will have you shocked. The book was definitly written to shock the reader, and it does. I'm not sure what the whole motivation was behind Mr. Banks to write this, but if you're into dark twisted novels, you will enjoy it!"
5,amazing debut to an amazing author,"iain banks Wasp Factory is an outstanding read...one of the few authors me (a sci-fi geek) and my wife (dedicated reader) both enjoyed....banks' sci-fi Culture and other offerings from the late 80's and 90's are simply amazing....this novel was astounding in it's imagery, original thinking and point of view and clarity of prose....kind of brutal yet elegant."
3,the sting's going down,"The perfect example of a book that was way overrated in the eighties and is somewhat 'meh' now. The three murders - especially the 'bomb on the beach' one is still pretty chilling. Reading this at 17 blew my mind (no pun intended) but re-reading a week back in my (ahem) mid-thirties, I realize what I took for incredible and shocking back then has become a little outdated now (compared to 'The Human Centipede' and what-have-you for the 'kids' nowadays.)Still worth a look for the sheer bizarre factor but not one for the squeamish."
4,Dark Psychological Fiction from Scotland,"I devoured this quickly and with great satisfaction and only wished it were a more involved and longer tale. I fell in true fascination with the protagonist and the expertly crafted prose of his depraved youth and surroundings and craved more insight; it could easily have been 200 pages longer and a good deal more satisfying. The protagonist is a young, isolated Scottish boy with a penchant for animal mutilation and magical thinking, it pulls you in and has many passages that resonate in their darkness. I would call this a must-read for fans of dark psychological works despite its brevity. The means by which some minor characters meet their ends will remind you wickedly of the great Edward Gorey."
3,Entertaining? - yes Brilliant? - no,"I found this to be entertaining but not as unusual or outstanding as the hype lead me to expect. The story line was bizarre, though the ending was just a slight twist on a film I saw on TV that was made at least 15 years ago. It is grisly enough for most gore lovers. The reviews on the book went from ""brilliant"" to ""rubbish."" I rate it in between."
3,Good read...(provided no-one has given away the ending!),"I have been recently introduced to Iain Banks' work by a number of associates of mine. Unfortunately they raved about it a bit too much and basically gave me too much information. I therefore could pretty much work out how the finale was going to evolve by about midway through the book. This in turn ruined what could have been an excellent book. Verdict: A great read, but only if you know absolutely nothing about the subject beforehand or you could be disappointed."
4,Excellent >> But Not For the Squeamish,"I don't know what's in the Scottish water, but it seems like all the fiction I've read from there is messed up (in a good way). This particular book is another in line, as a glance at the Library of Congress Cataloging data for this book shows: ""Fathers and sons-- Scotland-- Fiction, Serial murders-- Scotland-- Fiction, Teenage boys-- Scotland-- Fiction, Psychopaths- -Scotland-- Fiction, Murders-- Scotland-- Fiction."" That pretty much tells you all you need to know. It's a first-person account by an insane 17 year-old detailing his life with his father, as well as telling about the three murders he staged as accidents. It's totally sick and messed up, especially if you're squeamish about animal cruelty (and I mean real cruelty). There's a further stunning ""twist"" at the end, but by then you're prepared to accept pretty much anything that happens... Well written."
4,INTERESTING,"i think that ""use of weapons"" is the best banks book. but the wasp factory is definatley a worthwhile read. just read it, read it all, and then decide for yourself. i believe you will have some things to think about."
2,Weak - highly overrated - not really even disturbing...,"Sorry, but this book was a real let-down. If you buy it, don't expect to be shocked or disturbed deeply. I found the book to be moderately interesting, but kept thinking it was leading to something bigger at the end. It never materialized."
5,Off beat but totally worth reading!,"My first read by Iain Banks. Recommended as a bit twisted albeit offbeat by my book store and it filled the bill. Don't read unless you have a strong stomach for mutilation of animals and general disgusting violent acts. Once you get past this, the story is actually disturbing yet interesting. This book may not be for the average reader, but I feel it was totally worth the read and look forward to reading more by this author."
4,"Creepy, yet interesting!",This is a very well written book with some very interesting moral issues cropping up when you go through it. It is sick and perverted but strangely interesting. The twist at the end will leave you confused for days! Read It!
2,A definate 'macho' book,"Having been told to read this book over the holidays, I thought I was in for a real treat. Well I was and I wasn't. I must say if it's vivid and quite cruel and gruesome events that you like, then this is the book for you. Some parts of this book were great to read, and I especially liked the twist of the story at the end. However, the sickening images that were portrayed through this book I really did not like. The author definitely shocks the reader, but even with all this, there was something that made me read on."
1,Printshop problems,"While previous versions of printshop have proved quite useful, this latest release has riddled our computer with problems. Printers disappear from the printers folder, and hyperlinks to the internet cause software to lockup. We are running two different email programs. If a message comes through with a hyperlink to the internet, double clicking on the hyperlink works fine. If we then run Printshop 11, subsequent attempts to use hyperlinks in the email programs will cause the email programs to lock up. Reinstalling the email programs solves the problem. Hyperlinks will then work fine until we run Printshop, and then all of the problems are back. Multiple contacts with their customer support department have resulted in the suggestion of using CNTL-ALT-DEL and aborting all other programs. Not a practical solution - the point of running Windows is to be able to run multiple programs. Also, their suggestion does nothing to correct the problem. We will not buy from them again."
2,Where are the cutting guidelines??,"I have used PrintShop for several years, especially in making signs and banners in my job as a children's librarian. I have enjoyed the increased number of graphics and other features added with each new version . Since I run many posters that I print out four sheets by four sheets, I depend on the imbedded cutting lines (which earlier versions of PrintShop have had), which help me accurately trim pages so that a picture fits together nearly perfectly. In PrintShop 11, the cutting guidelines have been removed. Try as I will, I am no longer able to line up a 4-by-4 printout! The manufacturer, when contacted, offered no hope that the lines will be put back in in a new version, and my PrintShop 10 is nearly worn out from use. Love the product, but I will be looking for something else to use in its place that provides this feature."
2,Inside Fibromyalgia,worse shape than written about. Big square cut out of corner of cover. The book is good just not in good as shape as suppose to be. Prettty slow delivery also!!!
4,A good resource.,"Over the years I've bought a number of Mark Pellegrino's books and they have all been excellent. This large one is a compilation of many of the others so if you only get one, this would be a good choice. His advice is spot on, for he himself is a FM patient, as well as being a medical doctor. Unlike so many other authors who write on this subject, he is not trying to sell you anything, nor is he recommending a different way of life or a hundred supplements. It's all sound and sensible. His are the only FM books I find myself recommending."
2,Good Information on Bio-Dynamics,"The book repeats most things that all other books have on FMS. What was of value to me were the mental safety belts and strategies for safe and less painful movement.I am sure the author is a nice guy, but I would recommend Dr. St Amand's book on FMS...gives us hope that we will be reversed without being drugged, narcoticized, addicted, psychologized or demeaned. M"
5,Excellent source of information and comfort.,"Excellent source of information and comfort. This is the most organized, comprehensive and easy to understand book that I've read in a long time. It is clear to see that Dr. Pellegrino cares, understands and can relate to all that FM sufferers must endure."
1,This scale is just plain terrible,"I bought this scale at a local store and brought it home. I stepped on it for the first time, and found I was 13 lbs heavier than I had been just that morning! On subsequent tries I could never get it to give me the same weight twice and the variations were not small (sometimes 2 lbs, sometimes 10 or more). My husband tried it an experienced the same problem. It was also hard to set it up and make it work, it wouldn't always weigh you when you stepped on it and would often give an ""error"" message. All in all, quite possibly the worst scale I have ever tried. I promptly returned it."
2,quit on me after only 1 month,"it weighed me more than I thought I weighed, was not very accurate, then one day it just quit for no reason, this is going back to the store"
1,Didn't last!,"Sad to say these broke within weeks of receiving them...but well after return time. Cheap...not happy, whatsoever. I'm not an overweight gal, so it wasn't my weight that broke them...they just started saying ERROR, even with new batteries. There was no explanation in the directions. Spend more money and get something of better quality."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SCALE,"Totally inaccurate, puts out random numbers plus or minus 1.5 lbs and sometimes 2 pounds. This is variance of 3 to 4 lbs.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Horrible,"The scale is off on the weight. My weight was 10 lbs different than it was 12 hours ago, and was 4 lbs different than it was 20 minutes ago. My body fat has been jumping from obese to normal. It takes several tries to get it to actually weigh. I've had better results with a 'cheap' walmart scale."
1,About the worst scale I've ever owned,"This scale is terrible. The body fat indicator has never worked and the scale itself is usually about 2-5 lbs off, normally on the high side. I've compared my weight to my doctors scales and have been adjusting accordingly ever since. It also has ""memory"" of your last weight the previous day. I always have to weigh twice, once to clear the memory holding something of weight, and once to get a fresh weight. I put 40 lb weights on it and they weighed 45 lbs. I tried it with 80 lb dumbbells and it was worse at 87 lbs. It's worthless and I'm now buying a balance beam scale."
1,I truly do hate it!,"I step on the scale multiple times and never get same weight each time. Tried it in different locations as well to see if floors in the house are throwing off the numbers but it is just the scale. Errors consistently pop up too. You might as well guess how much you weigh, it would likely be more accurate!"
1,Didn't work!,"Unfortunately there is no ""zero"" rating, otherwise I would have give it to this product. I took the scale out of the box, inserted a new battery and read the manual. When I tried using it, it kept showing ""Error 0"". It won't even show my weight if I step on it, leave alone body-fat all that. I should have read other reviews before buying it."
4,"Not Perfect, But Still Satisfying","The beautiful Ms. Parker is back, some 2 1/2 years after her LP Kiss My Arp. Her signature sound is in full force-dense, earth shaking electro with foreboding, apocalyptic soundscapes. The 5 tracks on the ep are actually less inviting due to the absence of Andrea's vocals and less focus on the orchestral elements of Kiss My Arp. The other slight dectractor is the fact that the songs become a tad monotonous-once the beat drops, it plays through until the end in pretty much the same form. Still, Andrea Parker has an entirely unique and enjoyable sound, and her fans (or anyone into electro/idm/nice dark beats) should definitely not sleep on this release. Also, the 12"" release only features 3 of the 5 tracks from the CD, but they are the 3 standouts."
3,color video please,"This product does what it says, you can play your Ipod thru the receiver, and control the Ipod too. The people who made this, no doubt, ""es gente muy inventosa."" But, the first thing that shocks the user, is the black and white display. Here I am with a high definition LCD TV, and a $500 receiver, and I'm looking at what for all the world appears to be MS DOS commands with very low resolution. Shocking! After a minute or so, on your screen appears the primitive black and white notification: ""Press any button to cancel the screensaver."" This notice moves around my tv screen like it's been plucked from the video game ""Pong"". There's no one in the world that wouldn't like to see some beautiful, color imagery while listening to their favorite music. Why did this not occur to Pioneer?"
5,"TENNIS, ANYONE ??","This appears to be the only ""cheesecake"" DVD featuring Russian tennis star Anna Kournikova. There are multiple Kournikova wall calendars. But this is the only calendar video that I've found.So ... what's not to like?Anna's hot and ... she's even pretty good at tennis. Say what you want about Anna not having the ""game"" to go along with her looks, but she has inspired many Russian women to follow in her wake, including Maria Sharapova, Anastasia Myskina, Elena Dementieva, Svetlana Kuznetsova, Nadia Petrova and Vera Zvonareva.But if you are somehow expecting Anna to be nude, I'm afraid you'll be sorely disappointed. Hot she is. Nude she's not. Give it a shot."
3,MikaBomb,"It is good, but you will have to let certain songs grow on you. Personally, I stopped being impressed with the album earlier that I expected, but that's becase I typically don't go for punk music this poppy. It's well worth the price of the mp3 album, but probably not worth a physical copy. The songs ""Contact Tokyo"" ""Heart Attack"" ""Never gonna push me around"" and ""Super Honda"" are probably the best. The album winds down quite a bit at the end, but the beginning is pretty good. I Would recommend it to anyone who likes The Ramones, The Queers, or any other pop-punk band, although it does have it's heavy moments. Personally, I know I'll be picking it up again and again for years, just not as often as my other punk albums."
5,Well worth the purchase,I'm so glad that I purchased this product. The CD arrived in new condition and it has become my favorite CD. I play it everyday.
4,Good educatioal tool for kids.,"This game takes a little getting used to to figure out how to play, the directions aren't very clear. But once you figure it out it goes pretty smooth. My two daughters ages 7 and 9 like to play it and I am sure that it will help them learn geography without even knowing it."
4,Not great but not bad eather,"More Industrial than some of the others, little more catchy song wise, and still nothing remotely close to HYPOCRISY...PETER is just having fun, and now that hes with BLOODBATH, and has new HYPOCRISY album on the horizon hopefully HYPOCRISY will come back to form again"
4,Adam Sandler Video for collection,"My wife and I own almost every Adam Sandler movie there is, so this was just a requirement to complete our collection at home. Some of his best skits are with Chris Farley."
1,So sorry,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas, although I was looking forward to it, too. It was such a waste. There are so many skits that could have been on this dvd, but the ones chosen were subpar at best - not nearly his funniest stuff. A few skits/songs were worthy, but I would not call this the best of Adam Sandler. Although the other reviews are fairly positive, we found it very disappointing."
4,Best of is kind of weak,"I like Adam Sandler. This is not a horrible collection, though I think that they could have picked some better skits and segmants. Basically, SNL is trying to take advantage of having had great performers on theis show, and they want to get more money out of Jane and John Q Public, so they put these together to try to whet our appitites. They come close but miss the mark on this DVD in my opinion. There are better moments for Adam, and they are missing from this disc, but the DVD has its moments, and I would say that it is a welcome addition to our collection."
3,Keep Your Head Up,"Adam Sandler is one of the best Snl cast members of all-time. This DvD serves up the Laughs. A few skits include Alec Baldwin, but that's the only bad part of this disc."
5,so so so funny,I could not stop laughing its adam sanlers version of kings of comedy very funny good thing to watch whiel your eating not really for seating down and watching it like a film or by urself its better if your having a party or something to put it on.
3,A worthy addition...,"This is a pretty good addition to the SNL ""Best of..."" series. My only problems with it are that there are a few ""double-dipped"" skits from the Best of Chris Farely, and they threw in too many songs Sandler did on the show. I know that was kind of his gimmick, but there were plenty of great skits that could have been added that were skipped over. It's not the best in the series, but for $9.99 at Best Buy, it's definitely worth picking up."
5,The Perfect Gift,"Breaking up just got a whole lot better. This journal helps put the spunk back in your step and the confidence in your dance moves. And, -- it's the best gift to cure a broken heart."
4,Like any other snowbrush and ice chisel,"I've been in Indiana this winter and it has been particularly brutal. Nearly every morning since early December this snowbrush has been necessary to remove the ice caked on the windows of the car. It has held up well. No cracks or breaks, while I see bits and pieces of other snowbrushes littering the parking area, so I can't complain."
2,not enough features and very poor quality,"It's only thirty dollars, but who cares. The features are nothing, and it's not worth thirty dollars. another down is the way you have to set it. Not very good. It's very small, and just isn't right for your home, unless you live in a small house.Even worse, I bought this and it broke after one week. so avoid this horrible product."
2,would be great... if it worked,"perhaps i was unlucky, but the thing was totally dead straightout of the box, so i returned and decided to get a weather channel one which works fine."
2,Dingo Boot 587,"This boot looks really good, however, the soles are so slippery that it is downright dangerous to walk in them. I nearly fell several times in the course of a few hours I wore these boots just to the office. They are also poorly padded so that my feet were sore after a few hours."
3,Interesting but Confusing at times,"As another reviewer said, this seemed more a collection of trains of thought than stories. That said, there are a few gems mixed in, ones that will definitly stick with me. It's digging through the practically incoherent sections that are a pain. Some stories I skipped almost entirely, others I skimmed or read ahead. For less than $2, it's worth it, as it's not a total waste and she is a good writer. I think I'd be more interested in the many stories she starts and doesn't finish - maybe if she invested the time into one of those she did here it would pay off."
4,Practical cover for PK grill,We bought a PK grill this summer and love it. With winter coming we wanted to protect the grill so purchased the cover for it. It's attractive and does the job.
5,excellent grill cover,This grill cover was purchased as a replacement cover. The former was damaged in a move to the extent that rain entered through the first layer and was trapped. The replacement purchase was just like the original and is working very well.
5,Best grille ever made!,"This is a wonderful cooking machine that should last for a long long time. The most versatile Grille I've ever used. Just try it, you will never go back to a metal grille again"
3,The picture is not the set!!!,"If you think you'll get a pair of cool sunglasses or a real fabric belt or a crate, think again. I got this because my brother got the one in the picture from [a local retailer] (2 years ago).If you order this you should expect:(1)YELLOW HARD HAT(1).45 CALIBER PISTOL(1).45 MAGAZINE (SOME CALL THEM CLIPS)(7).45 ROUNDS (ALL ONE PIECE)(1)MACHETE WITH PLASTIC SHEATH(1)AXE(1)SPOOL OF WIRE(1)HAND HELD DETONATOR(1)M14 RIFLE(1)M14 MAGAZINE(1)SHOVEL(1)CANTEEN(1)KNIFE WITH SHEATH(1)REALLY CHEAP, UNADJUSTABLE, RUBBER BELT(1)M19A1 HELMET(1)FLASHLIGHTThe belt barely works.I hope I haven't wasted any of your time."
3,I agree wholeheartedly,"Vast Aire and Mighty Mi - The Best Damn Rap Show (Eastern Conference, 2005)Norfeest is right, although I give this album a 3-star rating. The Best Damn Rap Show should really be called The Best Damn Beats because the production from Mighty Mi (from The High and Mighty) saves the album. As for Vast Aire, he raps okay and the punchlines are aight. He kinda sounds like an underground version of Freeway from Roc-a-fella. The only tight moment I can think of is when Tame One (formerly of Artifacts) comes and blows Vast Aire out the water on ""Fighter Pilots"". Sorry to anger you underground fans but this is not the best damn rap show, period. -EJR"
4,"If you like backpack music, this is your cd","This cd is making me believe again. I've been skeptical of my indie hip-hop heroes lately. Things aint the same as '97. But this cd, a team-up from one of my favorite beatsmiths, Mighty Mi, and colorful emcee Vast Aire is just so fun to listen to.Best songs? The Workover is gorgeous, and Fighter Pilots is straight gutter"
4,Pretty Good Except For the Animal Noises,"This Double CD of Barenboim's 70's CSO Bruckner symphonies is frustratingly almost great. The interpretations are vigorous, fluid and coherent. The orchetral playing is brilliant. The only thing wrong is Barenboim's unfortunate tendency to sonically deface his recordings by groaning during all of his favorite parts. If you're not listening too closely it's not that bad, but on headphones, which is usual for me, even at moderate volume the ugly, unmusical vocalizations are annoying. Loud, they are very annoying!"
3,"Because I'm a wunderkind and I want to record it, that's why","Even in the Seventies, at the outset of his conducting career with big international orchestras, a time when Barenboim had no credentials to compete with veteran Brucknerians, he got his way. It's amazing how much music Barenboim has committed to disc, in fact, without any obvious show of talent on the podium.You would think form his extensive discography that he is another Bernstein, capable of infusing any work with his own personal stamp. That is far from the case. Barenboim, one must admit, was a wunderkind, but more along the lines of Maazel--he is a facile, willful conductor whose ideas never go very deep. That he has self-styled himself in the great tradition of Furtwangler is ludicrous.This Bruckner isn't terrible, and the CSO makes a good, if at times brash showing. If you must have Barenobim in these works--why?--his later traversal on Erato with the Berlin Phil. is much more accomplished and in wonderful sound."
1,Not quite as defective but getting there...,"This scale has given me problems since day one. It was the second scale I bought after I returned a defective one before this purchase. I was so fed up I thought oh well, this will have to do. Basically, you have to get the best 2 out 3 results from the read out and average it out. It measures different numbers almost every time! I thought it was the battery and then I thought it was me having lost weight from a.m. to p.m. daily! But I've stepped on the scale repeatedly and tested it and the results are ""right"" 50/50....and... since I belong to Weight Watchers, I've noticed that this scale is 5 pounds off. So I always weigh 5 pounds more at Weight Watchers and 7 pounds more at the doctors office. Too much math!!! Body Fat analyzer not that predicatable either. It gives wacky read outs too... I call this product my Scale Suggestion not my Scale."
1,BUYER BEWARE OF HOMEDICS,"I bought the SC510, wich is similar to this product, and it sucks. I didnt get a manual... They scale tips over or below your real weight if you shake/move slightly while standing on it... SERIOUSLY. I set some 20 pound weights on it and they read 17.2 lbs.... SERIOUSLY.... DO NOT BUY HOMEDICS PRODUCTS. ITS NOT WORTH IT , FOR THE MONEY..... WANT SOMETHING BETTER? BUY A DOCTORS SCALE.... THAT'LL WORK JUST FINE."
1,CHEAP,"I was sorely disappointed with this when I got it in the mail. It is very thin (you can see through it) and not worth the 25 dollars. It did come fast but with no invoice and no return information. I am returning it as I have found better quality ones for the same price. Also, ummmmmmm it comes in a small plastic bag with a card board tag with the picture you see here on Amazon. It doesn't look like this believe me!!!!"
5,I have been a user for over 15 yrs.,"I have been a user for over 15 yrs, you don't realilize how well it works until you run out and your joints start stiffing up and than the dull pain starts creeping in again"
5,Updated web links make this book an essential tool,"This resource should be on every serious searcher's shelf next to Chris Sherman's book(s)and Find It Online. Gary Price updates his website to supplement the chapters in the written book, which is very helpful. Price takes a slightly different approach to Sherman, which helps to find resources which might not be self-apparent from Sherman's books. I can't imagine being without either this tool or those of Price's colleague (Sherman)."
3,"Fun, but below our expectations",My daughter loved her smart cycle and the original game that came with it. All the others have proved to be a disappointment....which is probably why you find them on clearance. It was a great concept and then they just didn't seem to put the creativity into the other games that were created to go with it. I'd save my money if I had to do it again.
2,"Good for a first-time interviewer, not for someone experienced","This might be a good book for a new manager who has never interviewed before, but too basic for a seasoned manager or HR professional."
5,JPaul has taken it to another level again,I've been a loyal fan of JPaul N the Zydeco Nubureez. This CD is the One. I have all of his CD and I must say this is the one. Every song has that beat that just makes you wanna ZYDECOOOO. Who do you Love just happen to be one of my favorite.So JPaul and the Nubreez keep up the good work and remember to keep God on your side. He can see you through all things.
4,very good front loader for the price/efficiency,"Had to replace my older Kenmore front loader as the bearings failed, costing about the same to fix as a new washer. Price checked all over for something entry level back to a top loader which I wasn't crazy about, and I went to Home Depot they offered this 10% off, free delivery, a $180.00 tax credit, and $150.00 for gas and water rebates, so after all that the price is really quite competitive. Pros it uses only 5 gals of water, has a direct drive motor, no agitator allows for larger loads, entry level machine with consumer reports excellent rating comparable to a Bosch washer. Cons door seems a bit weak will see over time, doesn't spin out the items as well as my old Kenmore washer. So very excited about a new washer I seem to be very hard on washers so time will tell if its as reliable as I hope it will be."
3,Moldy smell problems,"I have the LG front loader and I do like it now. At first I have had issues with that moldy smell. I did pick up the smelly washer product of Paul Flynn and wasn't really impressed with it. What seems to be working really well is this Oxi-Clean powder stain remover. I add it with the detergent and it's been working really well. I have not had any more moldy smells at all. Another thing I noticed is I used to use an unscented for sensitive skin detergent because my husband has sensitive skin, and I think that may have also contributed to the problem. I'm not 100% sure on that, but since I switched back to a scented line it's not an issue anymore. The 2 together Oxi-clean and a scented detergent has been working great for me. I also keep the door open when it's not in use."
1,The motor is not strong enough,"I've had this washer for 4 yours and seeing problems in spin cycle.With a moderate to heavy load, the washer will stuck in spin cycle and will not end.I have to power off the washer and air dry the wet laundry.I'm guessing that there is a safety feature to unlock the motor from the tub but itshould be able to handle the load and never stuck.Avoid this washer. I'll never by any LG products again."
1,"LG stinks, literally, DO NOT BUY","Not at all impressed with this washing machine. Can't get rid of the mildew on the gasket seal. This is not a problem specific to LG, but if you search the blogs, it seems as though LG is one of the worst offenders. It has ruined $100's of dollars worth of cloth diapers.Do not buy LG products, also just had to replace my 4 year old LG Dishwasher. TERRIBLE products. Cheap quality and expensive."
1,Don't buy this washer,"This is absolutely, positively the worst washer. After the washer was just out of warranty, we opened the door to find that the tub was half filled with water. The water dumped out and damaged the wood floor. We had both the hot and cold water valves replaced and the washer worked for another year or so. A couple days ago, I was standing next to the washer after it completed the wash cycle and turned off. I heard what sounded like water running. Further investigation lead me to find out that the cold water was still going into the tub. Just to clarify, the washing machine cycle had been completed. I looked in the front door and saw that the tub was half filled with water.This washer is out-of-here. I will never buy an LG appliance again. Wasted money, damaged floors, repair bills. The cost the replace the washer was just a fraction of the cost to repair the damage the machine did."
2,LG does Not stand for Lifes Good but for Lousy Garbage,We have owned the LG wm2016 front leaking Machine for almost 2 years now. Does not clean cloths very well at all. Now the seal to the door is leaking water on the floor and will cost $70.00 plus for the part alone thank god I am qualified to change the part. Do not buy this machine unless you want dirty cloths and to spend $70.00 dollars every two years on a gasket plus labor for must people to have the gasket installed would end up costing around $200.00 dollars every two years to keep the washer from leaking and to keep it working. The LG Washer may be energy and water efficient; but you will not see any monetary savings from this unit by the time you add service and parts to the equation.
2,Paint Corroded a few months,"I bought the similar WM2455h. There is a design defect in the detergent drawer that allows overflow to run out the back of the drawer and down the side of the machine. The detergent drawer looks like it should catch any overflow, but it obviously didn't. The result is that within a year, the paint has corroded from bleach tricking down the side.Customer service was said that it was my problem for not cleaning the bleach up right away, but when I explained that bleach is clear and the design allowed the bleach to leak out from behind the drawer and wasn't obvious, he simply reiterated his position that paint corrosion is not a mechanical defect covered by their warranty. His suggestion was that I buy some touch up paint and paint it myself.His attitude alone was worth me never buying an LG product again. He was unwilling or unable to connect me with a supervisor and seemed too eager to argue.Goodbye, LG, we had a promising start, but this relationship isn't working out."
1,BOREING BOREING BOREING,"The Japanese should stick with making Street Fighter and Dragon Ball Z movies. At least those are good and entertaining.Making a boreing movie like Steamboy doesn't help anybody. It is made worse by the fact that it is over 2 hours long. I watched the entire 2 hours only because I was hopeing to be entertained at the end, unfortunately I was NOT.DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!"
3,Great steampunk design meets dull characters and annoying English voice talent.,"A gorgeous steampunk adventure to be sure, but ultimately this feature suffers from the sameness of many anime titles: uninvolving characters and lack of plot direction -- plus the ol' ""teen boy saves the world"" chestnut. YAWN!While the English dub is technically fine, the voices themselves are grating. As with many cartoons, a female voices the lead young boy. She consistantly sounds like a girl, which is distracting. Similarly, the lead girl is completely obnoxious -- she is voiced with zero charm or subtlety. She's a one-note brat you want to push off a moving train after five minutes of listening to her!On the plus side, the DVD includes a nice featurette on the computer graphics used in the movie. Visually, this movie is fantastic! At the end of the day, it's simply too long and dull at more than 2 hours!"
3,character versus plot,"While visually stunning, STEAMBOY suffers miserably for being a plot driven film with poor character development. Action, action, action, all at the expense of an interesting story.A boy's scientist father and grandfather are at odds over a weapon they've devised, and the boy is thrown in the mix, conflicted, attempting to resolve who is right and who is abusing science.Unfortunately, the film's story develops at a too fast clip, spending more time loving itself for how great it looks. It's a shame, because the design and production values are top notch.It's worth watching from an animation enthusiasts point of view, but know going in that it's a yawner. Action without emotional investment from the viewer amounts to boring viewing."
3,Steamed,"I don't believe that this a ground-breaking animation feature as has been suggested. The animation was good, but certainly not great; that said, the sepia tones were effective in translating the viewer through time. The concept was certainly inventive, but all the characters were classic archetypes with little to no originality in their personalities/actions.It took two sittings for me to finish the movie. I almost passed on the second ""sitting"" because I knew how the story would end. (I turned out to be right.)"
1,Embarrasing...,"I've seen quite a bit of Anime, both good and bad, but this one does not deserve to even be called Anime. It appears to copy all the worst characteristics of modern US tradigital (2D/3D) formulaic animation techniques, and is similarly bad-- devoid of the plot intricacies, interesting characters and expressive character designs usually associated with Anime. While there are plenty of interesting steam mechanisms, that's about all it has going for it-- any sophistication ends there. The plot is simplistic, the ""science"" too laughable to even make decent fantasy, the character designs typical US stereotype-mannekin-formula and the personalities unengaging. The whole thing seems designed by draftsmen or accountants rather than creative artists, just like recent US produced fare. Would likely appeal only to the undiscerning youngest of kids.Don't waste your time with this, just about anything out there in Anime is better."
2,don't believe the hype,"You won't find a bigger fan of Anime than me. I still have all of my old Streamline VHS tapes, including Akira. Mechanically, Otomo's attention to detail is extraordinary--the man explains everything. He's so anal about every little system that I wonder if he ever gets out and around real people. That would account for how intimately he knows machines, yet how poorly he's able to program real human feelings and situations into his work. With Otomo, Everything is so apocalyptic and gargantuan that the characters are reduced to atoms. Therein lies the problem with his movies. Akira, Steamboy, etc.-- the characters in all of his films are cardboard and generic. Otomo's films are overrated and he's overrated. Watching Steamboy is like watching an autopsy. If he could have put half as much effort into the characters, Steamboy would have been an ok film."
4,Very nice follow up to Akira,.... and one of the better Steam Punk movies out there. Great visuals and sound and I don't usually like to play the dubbed soundtrack but it was well done.
3,Disconnect,"There is some really beautiful animation and some great design in Steamboy, but the story and characters are just not very compelling."
4,Incredibly Animated Film by Otomo,"Akira's creator is back with a vengeance with his new offering: ""Steamboy"".This adventure film tour-de-force centers around a family of inventors and how their creations changed (and almost destroyed) the world. The whole movie reminds me alot of the old ""Rocketeer"" graphic novels (especially if you watch the closing credits).This movie's main message that technology is a double edged sword is hammered home in grand style utilizing some truly amazing graphics.Well worth your cash, more Steam Boy please...."
4,awesome animation,"this was one of the most beautiful animated movies i have watched. everything from the entwining machinery to the fast paced action sequences left me in awe. the storyline was a bit dry during the first half of the movie with the exception of a chase scene involving a steam powered automobile and a train. you could just tell that the creators of this movie were so deeply involved with the way the movie looked that they somewhat sidestepped the editting process. same thing happened with the first final fantasy movie. overall though, this was still a gorgeous picture worth a look by any fan of anime."
3,More of a 6.5 - 7,"The anti-corporate stance taken by the grandfather was tiring and old. The father was cliched. The story could have been MORE interesting if it didn't play on these old themes of 'corporations bad, weapons evil' which is the basis for this movie. The animation is good, not great, the voice acting is very well done (though I would have had an actual boy voice the lead role) and the overall plot is intersting. This would have gotten 4 stars, easy, if the politics of the movie were more subtle."
5,Truly an amazing movie,"Steamboy is a movie i have never seen before. It brings future facts and machines to the 19th century. Truly amazing animation, great story. The music was truly adventurous and spectacular. The ending blew me away. One of the best animes and movies i have ever seen."
4,Anime is Great!!,I've always been interested in animation from Japan and it amazes me with their inventive style on reality. Steam powered universe is a very different concept and the way it was portrayed in the movie was ingenuis!!
1,Not in English!!!!!!!!,I bought this movie with the understanding that it was in English. It even describes the movie add using Anna Paquin and Patrick Stewart voices. Even the preview is in English. But when I bought it.....English subtitles!!!!!!!!
3,Steamboy,Our family loves Anime but this movie was a bit of a letdown. With all of the Voiceover star power we were expecting better. The story is a bit slow and I hate to say it but we all fell asleep the first time we tried to watch it. We did eventually make it through the whole thing and it is OK so three stars.
5,Caught Me By Suprise,"I wasn't quite sure what to think--the name & cover makes it sound like a kids' movie, but it is not. It is a true anime (very artistic, character-driven, & detailed), with a pseudo-futurism twist. I was surprised at the great character development and detailed story. On the front cover James looks like some kind of mass-produced anime hero, but he is actually just a regular but intelligent person put in a difficult situation. I actually got this movie sooner than other anime I wanted to check out, partly because of the cheaper price of Steamboy--it is probably only the name & cover that makes it seem less desirable--but also because though I knew Patrick Stewart's voice was in the English audio track, I later learned it also has Alfred Molina and Anna Paquin (default is Japanese, but English is available on the disc). If you like movies that are better than most other movies, this is a movie for you, it's that simple."
4,an interesting movie.,"overall a good movie. good animation, story and idea. the concept of the ""steamball"", is cool, but unrealistic. if you are into steampunk, you will get a kick out of it."
2,"Visually wonderful, but boring story","I loved Akira, Appleseed,really most everything Studio Ghibli has ever done (Kiki, Nausicaa, Spirited, etc), Cowboy Bebop, Gundam, etc.This one didn't grab me. The animation is every bit as good as you would expect, but the story is just weak. I was really excited when I realized this was being released, but just ended up being disappointed. Some people love it, so DEFINITELY watch before you buy!!!If you are new to Anime - this is not a good starting point and if you have already seen it and DID enjoy it there is a whole world of great movies waiting for you! Visually, my favorite is Appleseed (2004 - there are older un-enhanced anime series shows floating around). Storywise, pick up the Studio Ghibli movie pack. This contains Spirited Away and MANY more classics (I think mine has 12 movies and it cost me a whopping 15.00 on ebay plus shipping)."
3,"Amazing Anime, Average Joe Story","I don't know about you but to me Steam Boy looked amazing if i could've kept my eyes open, Damn that was one boring movie but if you can stay awake to see all the intricate designs for the machines and weapons you well be amazed however in lack of the story, buy the special version so you can get the art book which is jaw dropping."
5,The Practicing Pharmacy Technician,"This book is essential in introductory courses for pharmacy technicians and compares extremely well with similar titles I have read. What is particularly interesting is that it is part of a series that includes other titles necessary to the pharm tech education/certification process. But in this case, the text is much more sophisticated than those other titles. Indeed, they make poor additions to the series when compared to the higher level approach taken by authors Ballington and Anderson. I highly recommend this work even when other similar works, also well written, are available. DJM"
5,Wow Comfortable.,"Have used it and love it. Most comfortable 25' tape I have ever had. This neat feature called grip clip is a rubberlike material that is tough but actually sticks to the edge of what you are working on. The Stanley stands out a little farther but this is twice as comfortable, easy to use."
3,World war 2 collectors set,"Hitlers Britain and How Hitler lost the war are fantastic thay share information that few have learnt about extremly interesting, altho some of the other films in the box set are extremely dark and label german people to be a blood thirsty race instead of just being informative."
2,Older materials...,The films in this collection were made during the war or right after the war. Older materials. Dark and scratchy. More or less propaganda materials for the west.The low price is the highlight from this collection.
5,What if Germany won WW2?,This is a unique DVD exploring the possibility of the consequence of Germany having won the Second World War. It describes actual British plans to fight against German occupiers with a gorilla underground army.
3,Collection of 1940's films,This collection of 1940's films makes some assumptions on what people were thinking based on hindsight. Lots of old clips and pep rally type of music.
4,World War II Collector Set,A good video set. A excellent way to learn about what happened and what could'e happen. Though still believe that we should be grateful that Hilter's General's wasn't the brightest in their time.
3,So-so,"This dvd set is a good value but much better sets are available for a few extra bucks. arrived quick, but one of the dvd's was loose and got kinda scratched in transit"
4,Review of 6 WWII documentaries,"It was OK. No captioning or subtitles which would have been nice when the background to the narration was shelling or bombing, esp the STUKA dive bombers. My other negative observation is the substantial use of stock scenes, repeatedly. But I'm a WWII buff so I gave it a 4 stars, otherwise it would be no more than a 3."
2,+,"weakThe best product reviews include: •An explanation for what you liked or disliked about the product•Product pros and cons•Facts and feature details•Comparisons to similar productsFor more information, please visit our Customer Review guidelines."
3,WWII History,"Nothing new here. Same old same old. I like the history of this period, and for that reason , I enjoyed these DVDs."
3,Pretty Pricey!,"I think these are okay. Very pricey for what they are. Also, the brochere it came with was only okay as well."
1,Problem with DVD and DVDACCSS,I got the Yamuna Wakers and video yesterday. I was pretty excited to try this.Problem can't run the Video!!!Gives me an error DVDACCSS could not be opened: The system cannot find the file specified.I don't have a Mac. I am running this on a Win7 PC.Any ideas?? Pretty disappointed.
1,Yamuna massage: dangerous and destructive,"Perhaps there are constructive ways to engage in ball rolling massage; but a Yamuna massage therapist has left me with excruciating pain, pinched nerves, damaged muscles, my body out of line -- in a single, one and a half hour massage. As I explain my predicament (I was perfectly healthy 3 weeks ago; friends are puzzled that I can barely walk now), I've heard other stories, about the damage those balls, and techniques can do: a cracked rib, for instance. I'm furious at my experience; I think the whole idea is irresponsible, especially for self-medication. But further, I wouldn't trust a Yamuna therapist to be anything but a zealot, intent on ""fixing"" you. And that's not good for one's body. Watch out!"
1,Nose dive,I can't seem to get it to fly.... Any suggestions out there? It just likes to take a complete nose dive. I hope it would have worked!
4,President Pierce - an honest man enduring personal and political tragedy,"For those who have interest in studying tough, stong, capable men who achieve our highest office but yet fail to achieve anticipated heights of power and glory, this brief, taut biography gives insights into a northeastern political power who harbors quiet sentiments for the South's ""peculiar institution"" and who fails due to the dichotomy of constituent demands.An interesting human drama played against a transitioning political background."
1,Mr. Smoothie,"When I put this CD on for the first time I had high expectations. The opening of the Brahms no. 1 with the beating tympani and tortured strings is probably best described as apocalyptic. It was thus with laughter that I responded to this recording of the Brahms no. 1: Karajan takes it mf and andante. This is the apocalypse a la Mr. Smoothie: no rough edges, no bight, no edginess ... no excitement. And I think that typifies the set - it is simply unimaginative, laboured and at times comically so. Much better to get the Kleiber Brahms no. 4 and steer well clear of this collection."
5,Karajan- Brahms symphonies,"No matter who plays, Brahms always satisfies. This edition, however, is superlative! Highly recommend."
2,Sorry Mr.Karajan,"Karajan has been hiped so much and has been marketed so well that people know karajan as conductor extrodinare, however the fact remains that his cycles of the Brahms symphonies are painfull to the ears. I own several recordings of brahms and would strongly recommend you to stay away. Sanderling or Walter are any day preferable."
2,"Mediocre, very mediocre","Wow. I had so much respect for Karajan before these recordings; I still do, but not as much. While before I viewed Karajan as being almost immortal in any interpretation of any symphony, I now know otherwise. If you want a good recording of the first symphony, get the 1964 edition of the ""Originals"" by Deutsche Grammophon. Karajan conducts that version much better than this one, I mean he totally butchered the first symphony here. As for the 3rd, he also trips. His 3rd symphony is not as textured or multicolored as his other recordings of the 3rd. His 2nd and 4th, while having some merits, is for the most part, dry, muddy, and without the passionate flame and directness that Brahms has to be played with."
2,Hard to work,We just bought this scale today and we thought we would love it because of the memory for up to 10 people but this is the problem with it the scale we could get it to work following the instructions. We did not have any problem with the weight or the body fat we tried them on different surfaces and it was around the same every time (we just had our weight & body fat done at our gyms so it was preety much the same) but when we tried to get the memory mode to work it did not store anything and we tried for a long time. We are going to see if is a defect or try another brand (right now we plan on returning this one)
1,Inaccurate,The weight read can change if I move the scale to a different place in the bathroom. The ultimate test for inaccuracy of the fat analyzer was that it did not budge after liposuction.
5,The First Book of Newspaper Comics,"I studied this book like a Bible when I was a kid, lying on the floor all weekend. I started on the easy reads like Allie Oop and Buster Brown, then slowly got drawn-in to strange ones like Krazy Kat. I was surprised by the great narratives in strips I'd only seen in tired forms, like Popeye and Mickey Mouse. All the way into college I was still making new discoveries, eventually coming all the way back to love the pure optimism of Buster Brown. Astounding examples of art are all through this book; It's amazing."
5,one of my top 3 favorite all time singer/songwriters,"Jonatha Brooke is extremely talented and a rare hidden gem out there in the large music world. Her voice is unique and her music is a mixture of pop and modern folk-type like Sarah and Suzanne Vega or Paula Cole. Along with Nicole Nordeman, K's Choice and Sarah, this makes up my favorite genre: Female lead, melodic, pop-folk with gifted songwriting."
2,Hit & miss operation,I've had this unit only a few months. In that time it only works about a third of the time. The batteries have been changed and everything reset a number of times. The remote sender and main unit are only about twenty feet apart; well withing the advertised 100 feet.
2,Very Short Range & Somewhat Inaccurate,"I have the remote unit attached to an outside wall about 25 feet from the main unit with only one wall in between and, even with fresh batteries, the main unit will not receive a signal. Also, when placed side by side for a half hour, the remote unit still reads three degrees Fahrenheit higher than the main unit. With that kind of inaccuracy and limited range, you may as well save your money and just flip on the local news. I would definitely not purchase this item again."
3,not sustainable too far apart,"I've found this Homedics wireless thermometer pretty reliable for many years. However, temperatures are often wrongly sensed by the LCD when placing these dual sensor/display too far apart. This weather gadget simply wasn't designed to work beyond its operating ranges obviously.I'm confused looking into many products out there not knowing which one I should get. I also find it hard to let go this thermometer which I've come to get used to over the years. As a loyal consumer , what choice should I make? Or I could simply adjust the distance so it would work. The only problem is I'll no longer have an accurate weather report to appropriately get dressed going to work every morning, and it causes a bit inconvenience for a vein woman like me !!!"
4,Round accent table,"I Love the distressed look on this hand painted table. I bought it to use as a night stand. The only problem is it's a little too high. I probably should have purchased the night stand, but I liked the round table better. It's beautiful. It was definitely worth the price."
2,needs an update,"Unless you have an older/inexpensive bathtub, this won't work. The side pad won't open wide enough to fit on a thicker rim and the seat won't go deep enough. Too bad. It looked great!"
4,Best of its kind.....,"I've been using this bathseat for about 4 months now, since my daughter was about 6 months old. She loves being able to kick and splash while sitting in it.I originally had this same type bathseat for my son, minus the little elbow rest, but when trying to purchase the same one 7 years later I see that it is no longer available. The great thing about the other one was that when putting your child into it, the front would rise up and snap shut. With the Safety 1st Tubside Bathseat, you have to slide your kid into it.Also, be very careful if you have a ""climber"". My daughter loves to try standing in it. Fortunately, the elbow rest makes it secure, so there are no fears of the seat tipping over, just your little standing monkey. You will still have to remove your child in order to wash their little bottoms."
2,Can't wash baby's bottom!,"Though baby loves this, I don't like it at all b/c I can't wash his bottom, which needs washing the most! I tried to lift him out of it so I could reach underneath him, but he is too slipper when he's wet. We will have to go back to the old sink tub until he can sit up on his own."
2,The old one was better,"We bought this new tubside bath seat, but couldn't use it because it didn't fit in the tub that we normally bathe our baby. The seat is restricted because it has to be linked to the tub. Although this is a safety feature, I really didn't see much that was wrong with the old blue bath seat. I ended up buying a used old blue Safety 1st bath seat on Ebay. That bath seat allowed my husband to bathe w/ my son in the tub. Allowed us to move the bath seat anywhere in the tub."
1,The old blue seat was much better,This seat has it's good and bad qualities. We just purchased the seat for our 6 mo old son. It's nice because we don't have to worry about him falling over in the tub. Although he wants to lean forward to play with his toys and it is very difficult to wash him. We usually have to wash him first then put him in the seat so he can play for the remainder of 'bathtime'. The arm rest is a nice idea but it would be nice if it could be removed when needed. Also the seat is kind of large and we've had a hard time try to store it out of the way. The seat also tends to move around in the tub. I don't think my son has has very big legs but when we try to get him out of the seat his legs always get stuck. I wouldn't recommend this tub to anyone.
1,Not for everyone II ......,"this seat does not fit in my bath tub either, I'm very disappointed and is hard for my son reaches the water."
2,Disappointed bather,"This bath seat looked perfect for our needs. We liked the idea of an armrest and the swivel seat. However, the bath seat doesn't fit over our tub properly. It is very hard to wash our sons bottom while in the bath seat. He also has very chubby legs and those are hard to reach as well. It is hard for him to play with his bath toys while in the seat too. He has to bend over so far to reach them and then has red marks across his chest and tummy. Very disappointed in this product."
2,Do not like it,"I suppose it depends on your child and your bathtub whether you will like it or not, but it did not work for my child or me. First, the side bar doesn't fit on the edge of my bathtub. The space provided in the chair handle is too narrow to fit over the bathtub. So, I don't really know what to do with this elbow support. Because it doesn't fit over the edge of the tub, it is not very sturdy. Plus, I didn't feel that the bottom of the chair sat firmly over the bottom of the tub. In addition, you can't wash your child's bottom when she is sitting in that chair. And I have an added problem in that my daughter has a LOT of hair, like a grown child, not like a baby. So, try washing her hair while she is sitting up! You will hate the chair too..."
1,"Hassle of a Tub Seat, don't buy","My husband and I had a really tough time getting the seat into the tub as it doesn't sit flush on the bottom of the tub. it's nearly impossible to get our 6 month old into the seat. when we finally got her in, you can't wash her at all with the seat around her. what's worse is removing the seat from the tub. it completely fills with water and needs to be tipped over several times to try and empty.this was a waste of time and money."
1,Pinches little legs!!!!!!,"This bath seat is AWFUL!!! The bar inbetween the childs legs separates and then closes again as the baby moves, pinching their little legs! I would reccomend this product be taken off the market completely!!!!!!!!!"
5,Baby must be large enough and a good sitter,"Our baby had outgrown the infant tub so we were bathing her in the sink. It was very difficult because we constantly worried she would slip. So we tried this seat when she was 5 months old. She was about 13 lbs. and 27 inches, I think. It didn't work at all because she was just too little. She was unable to sit back and lean on the back of it and she would try to dangle over the front, but basically, it was just too big for her.We just tried it again at 8 months, and she is so much better. She loves being in the tub and reaching for the rubber ducky. Now that she is even better at sitting she doesn't need to lean back. And I don't have to worry about her slipping. Plus, you can rotate them forwards and backwards. Washing their behinds is never easy, so I don't have a complaint about the seat for that either. It is pretty big to be sitting on my bathroom floor, but that's ok too."
1,DOESNT FIT MY TUB,"I registered for this tub, and thought it was a great idea. But when my son turned 5 months old, I tried to use it and it fit awkward in my tub. I returned it, thinking I would just get the regular blue seat that suctioned to the tub. I learned it was discontinued. You can find them on E-Bay, they sell new ones never used and w/ shipping I got mine for $12. I used it and it works much better than this model."
2,"Great Idea, but didn't work for us",I was excited to find a bath seat that would work with a no-slip textured bath bottom. But once we got this one home and tried it out it didn't fit on either of our bathtubs. The tub sides are not straight enough so the seat doesn't touch the bottom of the tub properly. I don't think I have odd shaped bathtubs or anything. I can't imagine a tub that this would work on. I'm very disappointed. I'll be returning mine and looking for another solution.
1,kyleesmom,Be very careful with the screw that attaches the armrest to the actual seat. My 9 month old was reaching on the side to grab a toy and hit her head on the screw and it made a big 1 inch gash in her head. I immediately went out and got a new one.
1,Very Unhappy,"I bought this for my 8 month old daughter, I thought it would be easier than holding her in the tub. I was wrong.....The arm rest gets in my way of bathing her, and she reaches up on the arm rest and tries to climb out. By the time I'm done washing her, her belly and legs are all red. I also find it hard to wash her bottom and other areas."
2,Pain in the rear end!,"Very hard to wash the baby in this. He can't play with any of the toys in the tub because he can't reach them. He chubby legs just barely get in and out of this thing and he is only 6 months. It is also hard becuase he does not sit up by himself yet. So for one reason he probably should not be in this yet, but for the other (he is a bigger baby and legs barely fit) he is almost too big for it.Just bought one of those blow up tubs instead. Much easier and he is free to splash like crazy."
1,Awful - waste of money!,"I bathed my 9 month old son in this seat. He has been sitting in a toddler tub up until this point and seemed like he was looking for some more room to play. The seat was fine while he was in it. When it came time to take him out of the tub, it was virtually impossible. He had moved his leg out of the designated leg hole and into the space beside it during bathing. His leg was stuck and we were almost unable to get it out until my mother-in-law suggested lubing his leg up with baby soap. This is all going on while my son is screaming with pain and fear. We finally got his leg out! He was left a red, soar leg and was very frightened with all of the commotion. Do not buy this seat!"
2,Beware of #2!,"This bath seat is very easy to assemble - it's already put together! It also is easy to bathe your child in it...many bath seats are too tight and make it difficult to access your child's body.We had to dispose of this bath seat after our daughter made #2 in the tub. When your child sits on the blue inner-seat, it depresses into the white plastic. If your child makes #2 in the tub, the ""waste"" will be trapped in the plastic shell and reappear every bath."
1,DANGEROUS!!!! SURPRISED IT HASN'T BEEN RECALLED YET,I wish there was a zero-star option for this bath seat!!! My husband mistakenly placed my daughter in this seat the backwards (there are leg-sized holes almost identical to the ones in the front) and it was IMPOSSIBLE to get her out of it once she had been placed in there. He literally had to cut her out of it by cutting the hard plastic with bolt cutters... it was a VERY traumatic (for me) event and we immediately called the company and complained (this was about 1.5-2 years ago). There response was to ask us about some number on the bottom of it. That was it. I was doing a baby seat search today for a friend of mine who likes the seat i currently have and LOVE (by Dream Baby) and was SHOCKED to see this thing is still designed the same way and still being sold. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Safety 1st my foot!,"We have had this bath seat for a few months now (since my son grew out of his baby bath-tub), and I really didn't have too many problems until tonight! My husband was giving my son a bath, and when he was about to lift him out to dry him off he took one of his legs, bent it, and moved it the three-inches it takes to stick it through the back whole. He sat there in the practically the split position yelping in pain as he proceeded to try to remove from that uncomfortable position. I ran into the bathroom to see what all the crying was for and had to help my husband tear the seat to pieces in order to get my baby out. His leg is very bruised up and the seat is now in shambles!Let me just say that this seat is definitely not safe. I thought this would be a good buy but was terribly wrong! Think long in hard before you buy this - because you'd be putting your child in jeopardy! Were calling Safety 1st first thing tomorrow to tell them our story..."
1,Tossing in the trash!!,"This item is a complete waste of money! I'm just glad I didn't buy it! If anyone hasn't noticed, the seating configuration makes it close to impossible to really clean your child's genital area without lifting him/her out of the seat almost completely! Also, I've noticed a lot of posts about the mold/mildew problem...eewww!!! I'm definately tossing this joke of a product into the dumpster!"
1,Dangerous! Sharp edges! Do not Buy,I bought this yesterday for my 6 month old who LOVES to take a bath and when I put hum in it to take a bath when I got done his stomach and legs were scratched pretty bad. If you do not want a scratched up baby DO NOT BUY THIS!!
1,Not what I expected,"This tub is not what I expect, I thought it would be easier to bath my daughter in this bath ring but I had more problems then solutions, first when I tried fitting it into my tub, it kinda tilted a little from the bottom of the tub, so you really need to check to see if it fit in your bath tub, secondly, I sat her in it and the ring was too bulky and hard...the hardest plastic for babies, she looked so uncomfortable, my daughter is 6.5 months now and I though for sure she would get something out of this, I couldn't bath her baby parts good, so after one use I gave up and went back to the mesh bath safer."
1,Too Much Seat,"I recenetly tried out this tubside bath seat, and will be returning it later today! There is so much seat that I was not able to get to my baby to wash her. The seat sits so high from all the plastic that I had to fill by tub 1/2 way full with water, which is too much water in my opinion for a baby. The seat is so bulky that my baby was not able to splash around or kick and it was difficult to get her out of the seat. The swivel feature was not easy to use during the bath either."
3,One problem,"We used a baby tub with a sling for our daughter from birth, and she grew out of it at seven months. So we bought this bath seat and it worked great until she was ten months. Then she wanted to climb out of it and stand up! There is no belt to strap the baby in and it is a very wide seat, so it is easy for a baby to climb out. Of course our baby is never unsupervised, but she is very strong willed and if she wants to stand, it is a difficult battle to get her to sit down. There really should be a safety belt of some sort."
1,Tips easily,"Okay...so I have a tub w/ an old fashioned sliding door and the clamp won't fit over it. So, I took the clamp off, and now the seat won't stay put! It moves all over the tub, and when my soon to be 1 y/o tries to reach for his toys, he nearly tips over (yes, I'm holding on!) Do NOT like this tub...will now have to go back and find something else."
1,Does not fit all tubs,This product does not fit all bath tubs. We have an oval tub and it did not come close to fitting it due to the crazy arm on it. There was no way to remove the arm and the seat does not have suction cups on the bottom so we had to return it.
1,Dangerous for older babies,"My 10 month old son liked the seat when I first started using it (around 6 months when he started trying to sit up in his baby tub). Now that he is older, he's beginning to move around more in the tub. Tonight he pulled his legs up and shifted in the seat while I was rinsing him, getting his one foot stuck in the back. My husband and I had to release the seat and then try to get him out without hurting him. The little guy was panicked because his foot was stuck and now has a bruise on his calf. Be careful with your older babies. I'm not going to use a seat at all now and will move to just a tub mat."
2,A waste of water!,"(...)When your child outgrows the infant bath (between two and six months, depending on size and activeness), get a bigger baby bath. There are several models (though none via Amazon, that I see) that rock, including one we found that's inflatable - it holds thrice the water of the infant bath but still a small fraction of what's needed in the entire tub.Besides, you want the water to flow and be replaced for a baby, NOT have an infant or toddler sitting in a tub full of dirty and soapy water, which may contribute to genital and rectal problems.Related: With this seat, you either suspend the baby *above* the water or waste dozens of gallons getting the water line high enough to *reach* the baby. Either way, the baby's butt is inside a chair and difficult to reach or see, much less clean.Still not sure? Try wiping his or her buttcrack while they're in a high chair. You'll instantly realize that a chair such as this is *not* the best way to bath a child."
1,Very scary and very dangerous!,While this version is much better than the previous version it is still very dangerous! My baby's leg slipped over to the other side and she slipped right down. I was sitting right there with her and it happened in an instant. Not worth it.
3,Doesn't Fit over tub's ledge,"I too, like many had the ""old"" tub ring with the suction cups for my oldest child. This ring is fine, except for the fact that it does not fit over our tub's ledge. I think most homes now are built with the garden style or roman tubs. Beside that issue it really serves it's purpose."
4,peace in the bathtub at last,"I was nervous about moving my daughter out of her tiny infant tub, but this bath seat made the change painless.Babies want to sit up and splash around/play with bath toys and parents want something to contain a slippery baby--this works on both fronts.My daughter felt safe and comfortable in this seat even before she could sit unsupported and I (and my back) appreciated not having to keep a hand on her at all times.Now that she's 1, she continues to prefer sitting in it over sitting without it in the big tub.I've never had a problem removing her from the seat, even the time when I accidentally put her in backwards.As your baby gets older standing up may be an issue but I doubt a strap on the seat would solve it. (It sure doesn't seem to stop it in high chairs and grocery carts.) Obviously, you still need to keep a close eye on your baby at bathtime, but the seat makes the process easier on everyone."
2,Son kept getting stuck in it....................,"Needless to say that this is just sitting in a corner collecting dust now. We started trying to use it when our son first turned 6 months old. Now he is 9 months. He is a long slender baby, but no matter how we tried to do it, his thighs would always catch on the underneath of the front bar. The idea of this tub was ease of use, but when it still takes myself and my husband to bathe him, there really isn't much ease to it. Don't get me wrong, I love the design. It fits our tub great. If we could get him out of it without him getting stuck, I would honestly rate it at 5 stars. When he has been in it, there were not any problems with it sliding around, or tipping forward or backwards."
2,AWKWARD,"While the concept of this made a lot of sense (I did buy it), it's just too big and bulky for me. Makes many parts of baby unwashable and hard to get to clean areas. The arm rest is a pain and makes taking baby out of the tub a backache. I think a simpler seat would have been a better buy."
3,great for baby but not for parents,"the seat is great for the baby and the parent to lean on but it is so difficult to clean and if you dont get the nasty build up that is hidden, it will end up floating around your baby! ruining bath time!!! there has to be a better alternative to the seat, especially for the price. it also (obviously) takes up a lot of space."
1,don't buy tub,I did not like this tub at all. My daughter's chest got all red from it. The arm rest is very uncomfortable and does not fit in the tub very well. Would not recommend it to anyone. I would rather not use one if I had to chose between this one and none.
1,do not buy this,"we started using this tub a few months ago (he was around 6months)it was great at first. But, It was hard to get his legs out sometimes. Then last week, my son got his legs stuck in the back holes. I could not get him out , he was in pain because it is a smaller area and its sharp. When my husband came home we had to CUT him out. We took him to the doctor and he had nothing broken but, he has mutiply bruises on his legs. He was so scared because he knew he was stuck. I called Kids in Danger and this has happen numerous times (and also mildew forming). The police had been called to cut them out. Please beaware of this.I will always have a phone with me in the bathroom!"
1,terrible!,"I picked this up at the store. I used it and it was terrible! My son is 5 months old (he is a big boy! More like a 7 month...) and just like Reviewer ""Spring Bird Momat40"" I couldn't get him out!!!! He was stuck!!!! His legs were so red from me trying to get him out of it.There most be something better!"
2,Not a great seat,"I purchased this seat because I simply couldn't find anything else. It seems like a good idea, but in practice it is awkward and difficult to use. My daughter is 6 months old, about 18 pounds, pretty tall, and is starting to be able to sit up pretty well. She tends to tip forward in this, and I just have a hard time getting to her bottom and thighs without tipping her backwards. And somehow, I don't seem to line up with the elbow rest and still be able to reach her. I don't remember having this problem with the plain old suction cup bottom seat for her two older brothers, but I could not find one of those anywhere. I would recommend a plain seat over this - it is just too bulky and awkward."
2,Not Pleased At All,"I bought this for my 6 mo old b/c she was getting too big for the regular infant to toddler tub that we used in the kitchen sink. The problems we found w/ this product are: 1. she slides down in the seat so I have to keep pushing her back up or hold her in place, 2. we had to lift her up and hold her in order to wash her private areas, and 3. it is a back breaker. She is 8 mos old now and we just recently tried putting her in the bath tub w/ nothing to hold her in and she did not like that at all, so I found an inflatable duck tub at Target for $10 and she loves it. We just sit that in the bath tub and she has a blast...and the duck quacks!"
4,I love it! :),"We bought this bath seat for our 7 month old daughter because she was too big for her baby bath tub and wanted to sit up to play with her toys. It took a few baths for her to get the hang of sitting in it - she slid around the first few times, but now she does great. The only problem is that I have to reach her toys for her when they float away, but since I'm sitting right there the whole time anyway, it's no big deal. Your baby should definitely be able to sit up unassisted to use this seat."
2,Going back to the store,"I was really happy when I saw this product in the store because, I'm looking for a replacement for the stages bathtub. The problem is my tub side is too wide for this to attach to. A good idea but, won't work for us."
5,Love this seat,"Before I found this seat I had the Munchkin Ducky inflatable tub(also sold at Target) and my son would try to stand up in the tub. So I decided I needed a bath seat, but I knew the ones with suction cups wouldn't work in our textured tub. Then i found this seat and it fits perfect and is very secure. I tried playing with mine to see if I could figure out what the other reviewer was talking about as far as pinching goes and i just can't see it pinching him, the blue part meets the white part really high up and even if he leans back its no were near his ""parts"". My son is 10 1/2 months old now and still fits in it fine."
4,easy and safe,"after reading the other 2 reviews I had to write in defense of this product. My baby loves it and it frees up my hand to wash baby better. It fits great in my tub. Baby sits safely and she is 6 months, weighs 20+ lbs and I have no trouble getting her in and out. I dont have to worry about her slipping. I love it we have used it many times with no accidents or pinches."
1,Does not fit every standard tub,"The arm rest did not open enough to fit on the edge of my tub. I have a standard tub, there is nothing unusal about it. All they needed to do was make it adjustable by another inch. What makes me mad is there is no alternative ""bath seat"". They took the other seat (without the arm rest) off the market since some very stupid people weren't watching their babies while in the tub and they drowned. My choices are a toddler tub which my baby is not comfortable in because they are never big enough or I have to try to give her a bath in the regular tub with no aide which is not very easy since she keeps trying to move around. Her bath time is no longer that fun because it's more of a chore. I wish someone would build a better bath aide that will work for every size tub."
1,Disapointed!,"I purchased this seat 3 weeks ago for my 8 month old son. After two weeks of using it I noticed brown flakes floating in the water when bathing my son with his two year old sibling. It took me a week to figure out that water was collecting between the seat and the base thus creating mold and bacteria. I was absolutely horrified! We used the older model of this seat with my 2 year old and never had this problem. I am amazed that the manufacturer did not consider this potential problem when designing this model. This seat is big, bulky, and potentially hazardous to your childs health. I would not reccomend this product to anyone!!"
1,Very hard to gey baby out,"I tried this seat when my son outgrew his tub at around six months. First of all, the part the secures onto the ledge of the tub did not fit well because our ledge was too wide. Also, the seat tended to move around with him in it. My biggest problem was trying to get him out. He tended to keep his little legs straight when I tried to pick him up out of it and it is nearly impossible to get him out that way. The sharp plastic scraped the tops of his thighs. He ended up screaming every time."
3,Not Lovin' It!,"I thought this would be a great idea for our baby. The bath seat makes it difficult to clean the baby. You have to remove her from the seat to wash her. And, the arm rest doesn't fit well around our tub. She is also not able to bend over and reach her toys when she's in the seat. She used to love being in the tub, now she is not able to splash as much with the seat. We only used it for about 2 months. I would recommend the Safer Cushion (you can buy it at BRU). It gives her the freedom to play and it is much easier to wash her."
3,Bath Seat is safe but awkward,"I like the fact that this bath seat is safe, but it is bulky and awkward to handle. It is hard to lift your child out of the seat and manuever them to wash properly. I do however like the fact that it attaches to the side so it is not sliding around the tub. Overall it was a good purchase because it is one of the only bath seats that I have seen on the market lately."
3,Hard to clean & smells bad,"This seat is pretty good for little ones who have outgrown their infant tub but aren't ready for taking baths in a full size tub. But this thing has developed a terrible moldy odor that I have had difficulty getting rid of. I turn it every which way I can to get all of the water out, and allow it to dry completely but it's still there. This seat is okay, but they should make it so that the bottom can be removed for easier cleaning. I am thinking of taking it back and getting the Snug Tub Deluxe from One Step Ahead. It's inflatable, and portable too."
3,Not to sure about this.,"This tub has it's pros and cons. Actually I think the cons outweigh the pros.First, it's a bit difficult to ""snap"" on to the tub. Also, no matter how long and how hard I try to ""drain"" the water out of it, it still has some water left it it. Not fun when you go to grab to use it and old water drips out. But the worst thing about it is, it's impossible for you to wash the baby's bottom. After each bath, I still have to take her out of it and wash the rest of her body that I can't get to when she's sitting in it.Otherwise, she does sit good in it and seems to enjoy being in it(despite the red marks she gets along her chest from leaning over to splash the water)If I could find something better, I am going to get it instead. But for now I will have to do with this one."
5,Really good buy!,"I recently bought this seat for my 6 month old son. I was really looking for something where I could bath both my kids at the same time (my daughter is 22 months). Anything to save time. Well this seat is perfect. Now that he can sit up well, I can put them both in the tub and put enough water in there for my daughter to have fun playing around. He loves the bath so much more beucase he too can splash, play, and see everything that is going on. I read a few reviews and there was some negativily about the when you pull the kids out of the seat they may get some red marks on the top of thier theighs, and that has happened. But they are mostly just from movign around and the marks go away right after you take them out. Just as long as you pull them out carefully you will not hurt them. I higly recommend this seat."
3,Great seat until mold grows!,I loved this seat for about four months until mold started growing inside. There is no way to take it apart to clean it. Unfortunately my husband tried to take it apart and ended up breaking it. Overall I do not think the tubside bath seat is worth the money or trouble.
2,Didn't care for this one!,We bought this for our 7 month old son. He is sitting up on his own very well so we thought that this would be perfect. It was so awkward to bath him in it. It was hard to get to his bottom well and he just didn't look comfortable in it. We decided to try the 4-in-one system instead and are really enjoying it.
1,Safety First gave me a refund because of the mold!,"We loved this seat for the first year. Now that we are on our second child, we thought we would use it again. After a few months there was MOLD coming out of the bottom. I called safety first and they said they are getting TONS of reports of MOLD on this seat after people have had it for more than 8 months! THere is NO way to drain all the water out. The lady said they are looking into re-designing it so it doesn't hold water.Great seat, but the MOLD problem sent us to a new seat."
2,NOT SO GREAT,"I AGREE WITH ONE OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS. THE OLDER VERSION OF THIS PRODUCT (BLUE SWIVEL SEAT) IS BY FAR BETTER. THIS SEAT DOES NOT FIT ON MY TUB BECAUSE OF THE SLIDING GLASS DOOR TRACK. IT IS BIG AND CLUMSY. I HAVE TO FIND SPACE TO STORE IT WHEN I WANT TO BATHE MY OTHER CHILDREN. IT IS JUST IN THE WAY. THERE IS NO SUCTION ON THE BOTTOM....IT TIPS OVER. THE IDEA IS GOOD, BUT IT DOESN'T DO THE TRICK."
2,Great concept,This has all of the features that I want. It however does not fit my bath tub. Please make sure it fits your tub before you throw out the box and can't return.
1,Safety 1st Tubside seat - NO IMPROVEMENT,"I bought this seat in hopes that it would solve my bathtime issues, but it failed miserably. It hooks onto the tub, but I have the tubsider already, so it was overkill. The issue is that my daughter's legs still get caught when I am trying to get her out. This is just another scam to get parents to spend more money on a useless baby product."
1,Tub Bath Seat,"When I had my first baby (13 yrs ago!), I had a nice seat for my 10 month old to sit in the tub that had suction cups on the bottom, and was quite secure (obviously w/me right there during bathtime). Now that my 4th child was born 10 months ago, I bought this seat for him with the attachment that hangs over the edge of the tub -- I find it to be the most annoying setup. It doesn't fit over my tub and I don't think it's very safe. I will go back to my old seat. Just my opinion, but I was quite disappointed in this new design. The seat was nice, but the addition for over the tub doesn't work, and my tub is a standard design."
1,Potentially Dangerous!,"We used this seat for 3 months with no problems. Then one evening my husband was bathing our son and he had him standing up in the seat to soap his lower body (you have to do this with the seat; there is no way to soap when they are sitting in the water) and he wriggled out of my husband's soapy grasp and ended up backward with his legs sticking through the back part of the seat. Those openings are much smaller, and his legs got stuck. We had to pry the plastic up to get him out, and his legs bruised from it. He was hysterical the entire 10 minutes or so it took us to get him out. We are very upset that the design of the seat allowed this to happen!!"
1,Do not buy this one!!,I bought this tub for my 6 month old because he had outgrown the baby tub. He loved being upright because he could play with his toys and splash the water. All of a sudden he starts screaming like something is hurting him. I pulled him up and noticed that the bar between his legs seperated and was pinching his privates!! I studied the seat a little more and noticed how horribly it is constructed. The middle seperates when you push down on the seat. DO NOT BUY THIS SEAT.
1,Horrible Seat,"We just purchased this seat for my 8 month old daughter. We have an old fashioned cast iron clawfoot tub. The arm rest didnt even come close to fitting in the tub. Which, by the way, the armrest is the dumbest idea ive ever seen. You have to fill the tub up so high so the kid is actually in the water. Also, my daughter loves to splash in the water. When she leans forward to do this, the seat leans forward with her and almost tips over. I have to keep a hand on the seat the whole time im bathing her. There is also a sharp plastic seam in the front of the seat. It scratches my daughters stomach every time we use it. Im walking out the door right now to throw it in the dumpster. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!! DONT BUY THIS SEAT!!!!!!! IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!"
2,Not a good fit,"Seems like a useful product, but when the elbow rest is placed over the edge of the tub, the little seat is not flush with the bottom of the bathtub. A bad pinching hazard. So I returned it and figured lots of people with standard bathtubs will have the same problem. The depth between edge of tub and bottom of tub was too great for even the tallest setting. A shame. Be prepared to return it if it does not fit."
2,Much Safer than the Old Rings,At least your child can't flip face forward into the tub if it looses suction on the botton of the tub. I thought this was be great for my daughter. She loves to sit up. The seat is reccomended for 5 - 10 months. My daughter will be 6 months next week. I found it difficult to get my daughter out of the ring after the bath. The seat didn't fit flush with the bottom of the tub. I did not like it. I will probably return it. I have only used it once so far.
3,Nice seat for splashing in the water,"My 6 month old loves to splash, so this seat is great for playing and hanging out in the tub. I just wish there was some padding on this thing, especially around the seat area. It's quite slippery. If I start washing him and he leans back and squirms in protest, his bottom slides around and his, um, ""front parts"" smack against the hard plastic. That has to hurt! An ok product, but I'm looking forward to the day he doesn't need to sit in a seat to take a bath."
4,Very Helpful Seat,"I purchased this seat for my son and started using it around 5 months. He has a lot of fun being able to turn some and play without falling over. It fits our tub perfectly and is easy to put in and take out. He's big enough now that he can ""attempt"" to climb out of the seat, but it is still very useful and handy. The inflatable tub we had gotten was a joke (ever try to hold onto a soapy baby in a rubber tub? HA!), so this was a welcome addition to bathtime! It would be nice if it would be a bit smaller for my skinny little boy, but I can see where the size would be perfect for plumper children. Overall, we are very satisfied with this bath seat and would recommend it."
4,Works just fine!,"First off, it is not designed to accomodate babies that are not able to fully support themselves. We bathed our son in a baby bath until he was a 13 months old. We purchased this seat because he was simply too big for the baby bath. It works just fine for a child his age and older! he is able to play and get cleaned easily. I find the seat is restraining because I do have to help him reach his toys if they float away while he is kicking. Washing his bottom can also be a bit difficult because he is in the sitting position. Other than that, it is safe and effective. I recommend this product to any mother looking for a safe, secure, and fun way to bath their toddler. I cannot understand why a child would have difficulty bending their knees to get in it!. My son is average size and gets in and out easily."
2,Be careful not to put baby in the wrong way !!,My mother put me son in backwards by accident (he is 6 months old). His little legs got stuck and he had to be pulled out. His entire legs are extremly bruised. We almost had to call 911. Putting him in backwards is a easy mistake because the seat swivles so if you leave it facing backwards there is a chance to put the baby in backwards if you are not familiar with the seat. If you do use I suggest marking the front with a marker so it can not be mistaken.
1,Terrible,Terrible! Very disappointed that this is the only baby bath seat available at 3 major merchants. It did not fit my tub because my tub is not very deep and the side arm did not fit all the way down on the edge of my tub. I don't think my tub is any different than most tubs. I tried it anyway using towels stuffed under the arm. You then have to fill the tub very full in order to get water above the base of the seat and on the baby's legs and bottom. Then you can't even wash the baby because it is very hard to move the seat even though it is supposed to swivel. I gave up in the middle of washing my baby and put her back in her reclining bathtub. I went online and searched for a different seat and found one. I sure hope it is better.
1,Aquababy makes one like the old one!,"I know the old baby seat didn't exactly stay put, even with the suction cups, but, at least, I could put it in the tub! This model with the attached ""parent"" arm rest is gimmicky and won't fit in our rounded tub. Why, oh why, do these companies keep dumping what worked for the ""new and improved"" models that are anything but? Aquababy makes a baby bath seat like the original Safety First and I'm going to try it because it will fit in our tub. I always stay hands-on with my kids in the tub so if the suction cups didn't stick it wasn't ever really a big problem. I never would have thrown our first seat away, but it wasn't expensive and I figured I'd spring for a new one for the new baby. Little did I know that it wouldn't exist. Anyways, if you only want the seat, without the parent rest, look around. Ebay's got bunches of the old models for sale or try the Aquababy like me. I found it for $17.99. Happy tub time!"
2,Doesn't fit well in all bathtubs,A friend of mine recommended this tub to me for my active and big twins who were not content with sitting relaxed in the old bath seat they used for the first 5 months. However we have a jacuzzi tub and the leaning thing does not fit over the edge of the tub.
5,Excellent Resource,"I've owned this book for over ten years now. There are many great chord books out there but what sets this one apart from the others is the fact that it includes the actual intervals/notes along with the chord diagram. Most books leave this crucial info out. This way you learn excatly which intervals make up the chord. For example: it illustrates that a C major chord contains a root, a third and a five, and then goes on to illustrate that they are C, E, and G. C minor is Root, flat 3, and 5 which is C, E flat, and G.With this info included you really learn why a chord is what it is and how intervals make up the chord, which is basically what chord theory is. Armed with this info you will soon discover that you also have a good foundation of Arpeggios! Kudos to Mel Bay and William Bay."
5,Tick tock tick,"Been playing classical guitar day in and day out for 5 years now and this is one awesome book! Every cord in every formation you could dream of. although I have discovered some special cords which the book lacks to define :) I highly recommend this book for any new, experienced, or professional musician. I believe It will help you progress and appreciate sound in a whole new way, it has for me!"
4,I just LOVE IT!!,"I love this cd it is totally awesome and it has really great love songs, the song by 98 degrees i do(cherish you) and i say a little pray and many more you should definetly bye it!"
4,ORIGINAL SOUND TRACK AVAILABLE IN U.K.,"I went to Amazon U.K. and found this great series WITH ORIGINAL SOUND TRACK MUSIC! The down side was it is only available to play in zone 2. I contacted both Amazon U.K. and Amazon U.S. but they are not much help. I think many Nam vets who own this series would be very happy to repurchase this series as most of us feel ripped off as we bought the series not knowing the music was gone. That was a great disapointment. Amazon, we want you to sell us this series WITH the original sound track! Are you listening?David D. 716 MPs-Tet '68"
5,Good Box Set,I ordered this for my husband who was a huge fan when this show was on TV. He is very pleased with all three box sets that he received.
5,Excellent Series,I received the DVD in excellent condition and in a very timely manner. I have enjoyed watch these episodes very much. I enjoyed the series while it was on TV and was sad when it was removed. I would continue to purchase products from this seller in the future.
2,Tour of Duty - The Complete Third Season,"I'm disappointed with the physical quality of the DVD . It looks a bit worn out actually. Anyone who's interested in purchasing any DVDs from this company should think twice.Content wise, this DVD is definitely worth buying, if you are a fan of this old TV-series."
2,Where is the MUTT?,"I was very disappointed that all the MUTTs (1/4 ton M151 jeeps) we saw in season one were gone. M38A1 jeeps used in season 2/3 simply can't replace the MUTTs for the Viet Nam era, just like Hueys which are not replaceable. Compounded with original songs/music are replaced by very inappropriate and sometimes totally unfit cheap generic music, and the grainy image (a little better than season 2), it's just a shame!"
2,Not out yet but expecting the worse,Soundtrack? Expect it to be the same as first to seasons out on DVD. It will be the cheap muzak background that sounds like it was mastered by an amateur.
3,Does not play music as posted on the box!,"It says ""I play music"" on the box but it really does not, it's only the rattle sound, I expected something better. The toy is just ok."
5,Great Songs,This is my first CD by J.J. Cale. I am really happy that I bought it He does sound a lot like Ray Bonneville which is a good thing for me...I would reccomend this CD to all music lovers.
4,Love the blues/rock music of J.J. Cale.,"Love the blues/rock music of J.J. Cale. I am ashamed to admit that this wonderful musician was unknown to me. He has quickly become a favorite. This CD has a great selections of his music, sure to get your toes tapping."
4,Just Good Music,"This is great Saturday afternoon music. I have played it at various times while doing work around the house, when company was over, etc. Everyone I've played it for loved it - even/especially the people who didn't know who J.J. Cale was. I'm having fun with this CD!"
1,bad buy,it was sealed but after 10th track started double tracking like old 8 track tapes. bummer! i really like j.j. cale
4,The Very Best of the Very Best...,"I was in high school when I first heard ""Crazy Mama."" I ran out and bought the 45--a thing we regularly did in antideluvian times before CDs and MP3 players were invented. As much as I loved ""Crazy Mama,"" the flip side--""Don't Go to Strangers""--was far better, in my opinion. I gave ""The Very Best of"" a 4 rating instead of a 5 because it doesn't include ""...Strangers."" Even so, you can't go wrong with the ""best of"" the guy Clapton goes to for inspiration. If you don't know J. J. Cale yet, or haven't heard ""Call Me the Breeze"" from his ""Live"" album, you're missing out!"
5,Amazing!,"This is my first JJ Cale album. WHERE HAVE I BEEN???The music is a refreshing, original and all consuming ~~ I haven't stopped listening since the minute it went into my player.You will not waste a penny buying this!!!"
4,So familiar so good,A guaranteed quality experience. Guaranteed as I had nearly all the songs already.The common fault in J.J.Cale's songs is the lenght - the shortness to be more specific. You just start to enjoy and then the song ends. Perhaps the tracks should have been also digitally lenghtened not only re-mastered :-)
4,Brief game review,"If you've played with Tangrams in the past you'll like this game. The pace is much quicker than expected, which is fun for me at least, but if you like slow, thinking games, this might not be for you. The added element of colored gem collection gives a flashgame feel to it and makes it more of a race and less of a repetition of puzzles."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,I am extremely disappointed - I also thought I was buying 4 balls. The ad is very deceiving. My dog also loves the face balls - don't know why but she treats them like babies. I am very upset that I paid that price plus shipping for one small ball. BE WARNED
1,Face Balls,"My dogs love the face balls; however, I used to buy them for .25 when purchased in a lot of 12. This place is selling them for $4.00 a piece. I won't ordered another face balls from him; nor will I ever order another thing from him. Talk about gouging the public. Here is living proof.Nancy TaylorKokomo, IN"
2,From Sketch book and diary,I found this book to be very informative and interesting perspective through Elizabeth Butler's eyes.Not something I would read again but I enjoyed it.
5,perfect for the kitchen,"I'm big on quality sound and top of the line equipment, which is why I was surprised I wanted this. We have a great sound system in our living room. But this thing is so darn HANDY!!! I'm a stay at home mom with four kids and we live in our kitchen. I can quickly turn it on and listen to some music if I happen to have a quiet moment or put some tunes on while I'm preparing lunches or dinners without having to blare the stereo from the other room. It really has nice sound. Don't get me wrong, it won't replace your surround sound system. But sometimes convenience is nice too (plus I'm getting older!) It's VERY easy to use and even easier to install. The remote with the magnent is pretty cool, too. I wouldn't have gotten it if it didn't already have good reviews and I'm happy I spent the money. It looks pretty neat under the counter too! Go out and get it...now!"
4,Nice radio/CD player for the price,"The under the counter radio/CD player is a nice looking unit. It comes with an easy to use template to help line up the installation of it for a good placement under the cabinet in the kitchen. I got this one to replace the GE unit I have had for 15+ years. I was expecting better sound; it is O.K. The quality of the tuner is average, and for not so strong stations, fair. I live in an area where radio reception for many stations is not strong due to my rural location, and the presence a few miles away of an 1800 foot tower.The unit's ability to accept an MP3 is very helpful with this sitution as I can easily plug in my small Sangean radio for better early morning reception around sunrise for my favorite NPR station.The 3 disc CD player is an upgrade from my older unit as is the remote. All in all a good unit for the money and fits in my kitchen very nicely."
5,Sony LIV is a great purchase!,"My fiancee saw the under cabinet radio at a friends house and decided he had to have it.I personally did not see the need for it, as we have an expensive system in our family room.Well, I use the SONY LIV everyday! While making dinner, listen to traffic before heading off to work, etc. The radio is constantly on. It is probably one of the best purchases we've made."
3,Audio in/out or speaker out?,"You guys need to be more specific, people can't just assume off the web! I need information. Does it have audio in and outs.Also, I would never use on board speakers! I certainly hope it has speaker outs, but this I don't know because you left it out. Pease be more specific.Thanks,A Target Customer"
5,Sony Kitchen CD/Clock Radio IFC-CD543RM,"This radio is awesome! I looked at other radios for my kitchen and decided to spend the extra money for quality. It has really good sound for a small radio, good bass sound! I can get stations that are hard to get in my area, and they are crystal clear. I am extremely pleased with my purchase, and highly recommend this radio. You will not be disappointed!"
1,Crashes,"I have bought two of Mavis Beacon software, and both of them crashes all the time. It is impossible to go from one level to the next one! Also, the manufactures don't offer fixes for these problems. Don't buy it!Unhappy-mother"
1,Crashes constantly and I lose the lesson--Do Not Buy it!,I bought the top of the line version for $39 and am extremelydisappointed. The nusance crash and it's reboot of my systemmakes this product worthless. Do not buy it!
5,Alfred Wegener was a remarkable man...,"Alfred Wegener was a remarkable man, ahead of his time in many ideas and concepts. This book is a wonderful, yet tragic, tale of his life and work. As an explorer he was like a child, wide eyed and excited; but as a scientist he was cool and collected. The combination of the two created a man of substance, one that I would liked to have met."
1,I am sorry I bought it,"I don't know how I heard of this CD, but I bought it. I agree with the other reviewers that the singer has a good voice, but a good voice is not enough to hold a show together. I find the songs depressing and weird. It sounds a lot like someone not happy with life and trying to cope by singing sad songs about bad things. In all honesty, I did like the one about ""Where did he get that new routine"" as the music was a bit jazzy, but still the lyrics were suspicious about him fooling around. I cannot imagine myself ever listening to this CD again. I am sorry I bought it."
1,not mac OSX compatible,"this product is compatible with MAC OS9, not MAC OSX, and will not run on Intel-based Macs"
1,messed up my computer.,This software messed up my computer. I had to pay for my computer to be fixed. I would not recommend anyone to buy this. I threw it away.
2,"Not really a ""in depth"" technology book","Despite the tittle, this book is not a in depth technical book. The author deals most of the time with processes, actions and suggestions of how to do/implement a LMDS Network, but there is a enormous gap when talking about the LMDS tecnology itself. It's a book that was written fast in order to be one of the first in this subject. The consequence is that it was not written for people that already work with Wireless Brodband Systems. It's a book written for people interested in a first and light contact with LMDS. Also there is a lot of acronyms used and not explained in the book."
2,Emerging standards,I beleive that the book is good in general terms. But it contains a lot of terms for which there isn't any explanation in the book. Also it doesn't have any comment about the emerging standards like ETSI BRAN HIPERACCESS and IEEE 802.16.
3,For the Semi-novice,"The book was obviously published in a hurry to fill the need for a book with up to date information on the wireless industry and of course, LMDS in particular. It seems to have been written for non-engineers who are interested in this technology and it's applications. It stands well enough as a textbook of sorts for the general methods of deployment, business considerations, and technologies involved. I would say it's a good read for executives involved in the wireless industry. The only major downsides to the book I could really put my finger on are the typos and unexplained terminology which pop up frequently."
4,ok,they are good for kids who are trying to keep up in class. they were truly great in their time. i am just sorry that I did not give a review when I bought them.
2,don't be mislead by the cover,"The DVD appears to be from a TV program called ""Modern Jazz"" from the late 80's or so. I was mislead by the cover as it only has Blakey's picture. But it's really half Art Blakey, half Richie Cole, and no more than an hour total. The cover should depict a split of Blakey and Cole if it must have a photo. I was expecting at least an hour of Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. However, there's what seems to be about 15 minutes of Blakey, and the next approx. 15 minutes is Richie Cole. Blakey plays about 3 songs - that's it. The only positive is that you get to see and hear the Marsalis brothers at the beginning of their careers, as well as a few other brilliant young musicians who play with Blakey."
2,Graceless,"Barenboim's Nocturnes sound like a toddler taking his first steps and managing to slowly finish a obstacle course without falling down. The kid walks slowly, pausing after a couple of steps, unsure of where to continue. These Nocturnes sound improvised, but utterly graceless."
2,how about moravec's?,I agree with some reviewers.I have rubinstein's and barenboims recordings but Ivan Moravec's is perhaps the best available recording of chopin's nocturnes...
4,Wonderful,"This is a set of 2 CDs, containing the complete 21 Nocturnes by Frederic Chopin, played by Daniel Barenboim, the famous pianist and conductor, on Deutsche Gramophone.Chopin published 18 of the Nocturnes during his life: 3 in op 9, 3 in op 15, 2 in op 27, 2 in op 32, 2 in op 37, 2 in op 48, 2 in op 55, and 2 in op 62. The remaining 3 Nocturnes were discovered after his death and were published posthumously. All Nocturnes are in a single movement, ten are in minor, and 11 are in major keys. Though they all have romantic feelings, they are not all in the same mood, ranging from dreamlike reverie, to more exuberant and emotional expressions.The performance by Barenboim is excellent, however, since the recording was made in 1981, the quality of the sound is somewhat lacking in richness and depth. Nevertheless, it is a great buy."
4,Support domestic house music,"If you don't get fired up listening to the first two tracks of this mix, you should check your pulse. A little bit weak in the middle, but this album makes up for it with classics and butter-smooth mixes. Always expect quality from Deep Dish..."
3,Wife likes it...,"Wife likes it, but the base doesn't balance well when the pole is extended. Be careful around children, dogs, a clumsy husband, etc."
1,Very disappointed,"Used 6 times and just stopped working. I have had other steamers and this definitely takes too much effort and time, may as well iron."
2,Garment Steamer - not for me!,"I found this garment steamer a total disappointment. The hose is so stiff, you are unable to minipulate it to steam a garment. The awkwardness of the stand, which did not stay in place was another letdown. I do not recomment purchasing the Home Touch PS-200 Perfect Steam Commercial Garment steamer. I have thrown mine away -- it wasn't even worth giving to anyone!"
1,Can I get another Brush ?????????,Can I get another Brush ?The Nylon Fur comes out of it.I can't use this.... Please send another brush.And water is leaking too....I don't know how to FIX IT.PLEASE HELP
1,returned,"Actually, I returned it because I didn't like it and I have not received credit from you or any kind of communication. It is too bulky and too difficult to more around the house. CAn you please send me credit back for this?"
1,The BIG Macy mess-up,"Well what can one say except frustration and more frustration.They sent the wrong product.Many phone calls to get admission and then a pick-up of the wrong product.More phones calls asking ""where is the correct product""Here we are at the 21st Jan 2007 and STILL NO CORRECT PRODUCT.Has all hope been lost for good customer service.Is this how Macy's choose to operate on the web?PLEASE get this situation resolved. NOW!"
1,Unit was defective.,"Worked for about 5 minutes, then no steam. Turned it off and on several times, refilled the water tank and still nothing. It burped out some hot water instead of steam once or twice. Not happy..."
3,Good for small jobs,"I like that the product can compact and fit into a nook in my closet. It's perfect for small jobs and kicks out plenty of steam. For the money, it's a good little steamer."
1,30 seconds of Heat,"I got this as a Christmas present and was excited to use it. I set it up, plugged it in, after thirty seconds it was getting hot and I saw a tiny bit of steam! Then it died. I waited 3 minutes hoping it would start working again and it didn't. Waited an hour to see if it needed to fully cool down and then tried it again and it was still dead. I will be returning it for a refund."
1,Nothing perfect about this unit,"Dead on arrival. Worked for about 1 minute, then stopped. No amount of resetting or cleaning brought it back to life."
3,steamer not everything,"I was exicted about receiving my steamer, though it takes some getting use to. You need a good backing to hold garment in place, otherwise you have to hold your hand behind it and hope you don't get steammed....it does get hot, some garments are better ironed then steamed.It's great for the light weight stuff that need a quick steam over.I wont get rid of my iron just yet."
2,Always breaks,"This is a great item when it works, though I have ordered two of them and they each stop working after a few uses. If you are considering buying, you should know that it will stop working very quickly."
2,Disappointed,"I received my Homedics steamer today, and it's going right back, I'm afraid! I sell clothing on line, and I had high hopes for this device, as many folks on the message board I frequent said they couldn't live without theirs! It's not really any easier than ironing, in my opinion, and it won't press seams or collars the way an iron will. I spent way more time trying to get the wrinkles out with the thing than I would have just ironing the shirt I was working on, and it still came out looking kind of ""limp."" The pole is too short, so I had to squat down to steam longer skirts-- forget about dresses! It will also be way too easy to scald myself, and the reset light came on about 5 times in the first 20 minutes of use, for whatever reason-- there was plenty of water in there, and it was not plugged into a gfi outlet-- I finally gave up. I think I will just invest in better steam iron! It was worth a try, I guess."
2,dissapointed,"The product is not what i expected. I thought that my shirts would be looking like the ones on the store, but it didn't"
1,Water Reservoir poorly designed,"I too have experienced the water tank caving in and not working properly if you forget to take the water tank out of the steamer unit, and mind you, you must also remove the cap from the water reservoir even after you remove it from the steamer. I have tried putting hot water in the tank in an attempt to regain its original shape to no avail. I would not recommend buying this steamer for this reason."
3,Home Touch,"I think this is an okay product. I have two problems with it. First the rollers on the bottom do not have locks on them. When I barely touch the steamer it wants to move on me. Second the bottom is not heavey enough, when I start to steam a shirt from the inside the steamer wants to tip over."
1,doesn't work,worked about 5 minutes shut off and never came back on.Home Touch PS-200 Perfect Steam Commercial Garment Steamer
3,so-so,"I had read the reviews before buying so I wasn't surprised by it. The steamer works ok but is definitely not a replacement for ironing. I don't think it will replace dry cleaning either as it failed to remove odor - as a matter of fact because of the steam, the odor became more pronounced. But the price wasn't bad and my expectations were low."
1,worked for a hour!!!!,I was real excited to use this steamer but I wish I would of read the reviews first.It does do a beautiful job when it was working. But much like others you had to keep resetting it and then it would not start at all. I know the store I bought it from would take it back and I was thinking about replacing it with another. But I have decided to give another brand a try.
1,Had to ditch it,"I was sorely disappointed with this steamer. I originally bought it for $99 and bought 3 of them - 2 as Mother Day gifts and one for myself. Both gifts were returned because the steamer took almost 15 minutes to heat up and after about 5 uses, it stopped working all together. In my case I used the steamer 4 times and loved it initally, until it to died out. I can see this happening to one unit, but all 3 having the same problem? I just threw mine out in the garbage with a note that said don't bother it won't work."
1,Stopped working,I Received the steamer as a gift and used it minimally for a few shirts. suddenly it stopped working and the rest button stayed on indefinitely. After reading numerous reviews on many other sites I cam to realize it was cheaply made with poor parts and heating element. Don't waste your money!
1,"Worked, sorta, until it caught on fire","The steamer performed reasonably, until after a year of light use, it started sparking one day and almost caught on fire before I unplugged it and threw it out. For some reason, I bought another, which worked somewhat well until it died two years later. Now it just gurgles, but doesn't emit steam. Also: the orange safety light on both units tripped the power at least two or three times, each time I used it. Big hassle. I'd stay away from this."
2,Not worth it.,You get for what you pay. From my experience (I use to work in retail) only the really expensive steamers work well ($150+). I tried using it a few times and ended up returning. Better off taking time and ironing your clothes instead.
1,Good Idea - Bad Investment :),"I bought this item and used it a lot - while it was good, it served its purpose and it served it well...However...Even though I always used filtered water in it... somehow, the system got clogged up and it stopped working.No one was ever able to get me an answer, because it seemed to be ""out of warranty"" both from the store where I bought it,and also the manufacturer.I had no choice but to throw it away. :(Now - if I divide the price I paid by the number of months that I was able to use it - it was a rather expensive investment...I am looking for another one - different name brand to see if I get better luck on the second time around."
2,to many issues with this one,"bought this prodect this weekend. Thought this would save me time when ironing my kids uniforms for the week...no!! The creasing tool kept coming off and the reset light kept coming on,like every 1 minuteTo me, besides the reset button its actually not a bad product if you just want to knock out a few wrinkles or dont want your pants creased.Didnt save me any time at all! I ended up pulling back out the iron and board..back to square one."
1,it broke within 5 minutes,"it broke within five minutes! can you believe it?i bought it from macy's. i know it is cheap, but i did not expect it to survive only 5 minutes."
1,I gave it one star because no stars isn't an option.,Life is too short to waste time and money on this garbage. Giving the product one star assumes it has any redeeming qualities. Bought the steamer a week ago and had fairly low expectations because of the price. The first time we started it we noticed that the hose becomes to soft and collapses!! We had to keep playing with the hose to keep steam flowing to the head. The unit stopped running the second time we used it. My guess is it tripped an overload because steam pressure built up due to the kinked hose. This thing is crap. Shame on Home Touch for releasing a product with such a significant design flaw. DON'T BUY IT. Spend a little more to get something that won't bring headaches.
1,Don't Bother,"Don't bother with this one. The first one I got, I thought it was defective so I exchanged it. 2nd one has the same problem. The auto shut-off, which is supposed to be the safety feature when the tank is empty, continuously goes off. Then you try the reset button, and it won't work until at least 30 more seconds goes by. You're lucky if you can steam even 1 garment without having to reset it 5 times. You spend more time waiting to hit the reset button than you do to actually steam a garment!"
4,"Great price, convenient and effective.","I was looking for a good way to remove wrinkles as our front-loading dryer has a tendency to create copious amounts of them! This steamer is: priced attractively; ready to steam in under a minute; has enough steam for almost an hour; and works on a great variety of fabrics. I would love the hanger to be more stable, but it does the job.On the service end, the lid to the water tank was broken when I unpacked the unit. This doesn't say too much for quality control, but that's another story. Contact information was a little work, but after emailing the company they very promptly sent me out a replacement tank free of charge. Kudos to Homedics!"
1,Not worth your time,"I was sooo excited to buy this for myself after months of researching steamers and the thought of not having to iron. I ordered this product and after ""using"" it one time I have already put it back in the box to return. I am so disappointed in this steamer. I tried 3 different garments of clothing (dress pants, dress shirt, and sweater) and the steamer did not remove any wrinkles. I even let it sit a few more minutes thinking it was not hot enough. The whole point of having this is so that I don't have to iron-- now I have to iron anyway."
4,Will not replace your iron,"Just a quick note, not a true review: if you are looking to replace your iron, this will not do it for you. Good for touch-ups, will not give you a crisp ironed look."
4,Not Bad,Being skeptical and not very handy with an iron I reluctantly decided to pick one up. I have to say it's not bad at all.I gave it a good test and bought a brand new button down shirt that was folded and pinned. It took most of the wrinkles out and the shirt looked pretty good. Not sure yet how to do creases very well. I have to say that so far I am happy with my purchase! It certainly has worked out better than every time I have used an iron:)
2,Worked Great Until It Broke.,"Until very recently, I LOVED this garment steamer. I used it about 3 times a week to steam wrinkles out of my clothes in the morning before getting ready for work. It did a great job. That is, until it broke. The plastic connector that attaches the black hose to the base of the steamer broke. I had used it for approximately 8 months. Dissappointing for what is marketed as a commercial grade appliance. If you're only planning on using your garment steamer occasionally, this is probably a pretty good one. If you're looking for a garment steamer to use on a regular basis this probably isn't the best one to choose."
3,"A good value, but it has flaws","POSITIVES: This steamer is a good value for its price. It does a decent job steaming clothes that are not too wrinkled and it works well so far using distilled water. I like the fact the pole folds down for storage, and the insulated hose is a great idea.NEGATIVES: The rollers are a nice touch, but do not lock, so the steamer will move around as you are using it. The pole is not tall enough and I find myself in a constant state of bending while steaming. It is also not stable and will tip over very easily (top heavy). It has not sputtered much for me, but I do find myself stretching the hose often to prevent sputtering. I do recommend taking the water reservoir off when not in use and drying it out since the standing water inside will start to smell."
4,Home Touch PS-200 Perfect Steam Garment steamer - good value,"Much more efficient than the table top steamer it replaced. The brush helps a lot with the more delicate materials. Distilled water is recommended over tap water - it's worth going to the slight extra expense. We have hard water here and I had to clean the unit out after the first use (I let the tank run out of water. You must go through a reset process, then). Had a bit of a problem with the reset button - the button may not have enough play in it.It does a good job; having the pole which serves as a hanger for the pieces makes the job much easier."
1,Stopped working within 6 weeks,"This steamer automatically shuts the steam off somewhat frequently, I imagine as a safety precaution. This would happen at least once while I was in the middle of steaming the same article of clothing. Once you realize that the unit has stopped producing steam, you need to push a button at the base to enable the steam production once again. You need to do this each time the steam stops which is somewhat a pain. The biggest disappointed - I have used this steamer on only about a dozen clothing items since I received it about 6 weeks ago and the steamer no longer turns on. The switch does not even light up when I switch the unit on now. This is a big disappointment and since it is past 30 days from shipment, I can no longer get a refund."
2,Don't bother,"I thought I did my due diligence in researching this product, but it seems I could not trust the reviews that after purchasing this thinking that I would like it better than a handheld, I was wrong. It is not tall enough, it seems a little unstable for the heaviness of the hose, the hose gets crimped, and the hose is too long so you do not get the same steam power as you do out of the handheld. It is actually harder than using an iron. I will be returning this to purchase a handheld today."
2,Sreamer,Not as good a product as i thought I would get. Steamer only works a short time & then it runs out of steam.
1,Steamer has engineering problem,"I am in clothing wholesale and get samples twice a year which need steaming. This unit quit in 2nd day of use. It took a while to figure it out. The plastic container that holds the water evidently became too hot and the bottom caved inward. This caused the opening too sit too high and it would not release the water into the tank. At that point the automatic shut off would turn off the unit. For those whose units are quitting, if you put water in the bottom and forget putting container there, it will work. I wouldn't recommend this unit to anyone. The manufacturer's need to correct this problem."
1,Got 5 minutes out of it,"This worked great...for 5 minutes. I tried everything to make it work again over three days. I finally contacted customer service and they said there is nothing else to do - send it to them and they will replace it. I'm glad they were responsive, but now I have to pay to ship the darn thing to Michingan."
5,Great product,This product works great. It is easy to assemble and heats VERY quickly. The only issue is water leakage if you don't follow instructions and hold the hand steamer above the base unit. It also requires a fairly large storage area due to its size.I found it to be very useful for steaming draperies.
1,last gasp steamer,"I thought this steamer was terrific for the first few months and then it started losing steam. I don't use it very often so I didn't worry about it too much. Now after a year of use, it finally let out its' last gasp this afternoon and, altho' the light is on, there's ""nobody"" home. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It seems to me that a product should last longer than the one year guarantee."
1,I wonder what the stated mean time to failure is for it.,"My husband and I received this steamer as a gift, and we were incredibly excited about it; we had always wanted a garment steamer. It worked amazingly well for about 4 months. Now, I am lucky if I get 3 minutes of steam out of it, as it seems to continually trip the reset mechanism, and it quickly runs out of steam altogether. For the stated price, this equipment is a complete waste of money. I am highly disappointed."
1,my 1st Steamer,"I read all the reviews and decided to purchase anyway - they were all true - all the good and bad reviews were on the money - but I needed a steamer for quick jobs. It does topple over because of the small base, the head of the steamer hit me in the face a couple of times because the hose is stiff and not pliable and it takes a long time to get the wrinkles out and leaves the garment kind of wet - perhaps because one is obviously using steam but then the temporary wet-smooth soon becomes dry-wrinkle - it would be kind of funny if it did not cost $50 - I tried it once and have not used it since - if I had not gotten rid of the box I would return it - I HIGHLY and STRONGLY recommend that if you really want to jump on the steam bandwagon, that you buy a top of the line model with more pressure and better engineering instead."
2,Yard Machine 20 ton splitter,"I agree with the other review written about the amount of Hydraulic Fluid needed to get started. The instructions say that you need at least 1 gallon less. It works fine if you are splitting small pieces, but is not the splitter you want for any wood larger than 8 - 10 in around."
3,Not a new collection,"Just a re-boxing of 3 CDs. Can't beat the artists, but there is nothing new here. Check some of the other collections first like the Ultimate Rat Pack Collection."
4,Don't Pay Through the Nose for This!,"Mushroomhead is selling this cd at their merch table on the current tour for $10.00! For the price of a ticket to the show and the $10 for the cd, you'll still be paying less than what people on here are asking for it. Buyer beware!"
4,Informative book,I enjoyed reading this book and it gave me some new ideas. I especially liked the discussion about making quilts from chenille since I am the Quilting host at BellaOnline. I think that it is a bit cumbersome the way the patterns are included since they have to be enlarged. I was glad to see the pattern for the asymmetrical vest and the jacket. They are both very creative patterns perfectly suited for chenille.
4,A few HILARIOUS skits,"This movie has some very hilarious skits...GOULET! Of course not all the skits are funny, but for the most part, if you like Will Farrell, you'll get your $$$'s worth...GOULET!"
2,The Best of Will Ferrel,I didn't get both dvd's but you were fair when I sent the e-mail and got the refund.
1,How the *@#$ can this hack have a best of release?!?!?!?!?,"Everyone with half a brain knows that the best & only cast of SNL worth watching was back in the late 80's to early 90's with the likes of Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, Kevin Nealon, among others. Every cast before or since has been nothing but a sinkhole of talentless, boring, pathetic losers trying to be something they're not.... funny. The only way any of these people, especially Will Ferrell, could make me laugh is if they fell down a few flights of stairs and broke thier necks. Please, if you are entertaining the idea of purchasing this dreck, do something more constructive with your money... throw it out the window. That's what your doing anyway."
1,Who made these?,"All of the best of from the SNL collection, seem to be terrible. This one is bad as well. Who ever selects the clips and skits that go on these DVD's must be the same people that are destroying the currnt show of today, as that is awful too.This DVD misses many, many classic and great Will Ferrell skits, like ""Get off the shed"", which is probably one of his most famous bits.Very poor compilation of the last funny person from SNL."
2,"Boooo!!!! Too short, not enough of the good stuff.","I think there are much better comedians out there, but there were many funny Will Ferrell moments on SNL. Too bad such a small percentage of them are featured on this DVD.ONE Jeopardy skit? Not even the funniest one? No Janet Reno stuff - I truly expected to see the Dance Party. I don't even recall seeing George W. skits. I also didn't like that many of the skits were truncated.I expected this DVD to be a LOT longer - slightly more than an hour total was too short. I would've paid more to get one DVD that contained a lot more skits.To be fair, most of the skits contained on this DVD are funny. But this is overshadowed by the disappointment of not seeing the best of the best and the too short duration.I planned on buying the other ""Best of"" DVDs - Eddie Murphy, Phil Hartman, etc., but now I think I'll try to rent or wait and get them used."
2,Not What I Expected,"I am the biggest Will Ferrell fan that I know. So, you could image how excited I was when I heard that the Best of Will Ferrell was coming out on DVD. I picked it up the day it came out, and the second I got home I watched the whole thing through, that is to all 8 or so skits. Not only was it hugely lacking in length, but so many of his most brilliant performances, like the unibomber at his high school reunion, and many others that I can't think of off hand, wheren't included. And, the producers of Will Ferrell's best of managed to pick the worst of his cheerleader and morning talk show skits. The fact of the matter is that Will Ferrell is funny in everything he does. So, the one deciding factor in why not to purchase this dvd is that there are such few skits showed. You will see more of Will Ferrell just watching the SNL reruns on Comedy Central in one night."
2,Where's the best?,I am a HUGE Will Ferrell fan and I was extremely disappointed in the skits that they chose to put on this DVD. Where is the skit with Jim Carrey? Why did they cut half of the skit in the conference room where he wore the Stars and Stripes on a thong? Still hoping to get a DVD with his best skits on it. He is so extremely funny and most of these weren't.
3,A small showing of the potential of this great comedian,"Even though the quality of these sketches is uneven, with some been extremely funny, like the one with the dysfunctional family, and others kind of boring, one can definitely see the talent of Will Ferrell. Especially in what has to do with impersonations and over the top funny situations.I recommend this DVD to Ferrell's fans, since they will probably get a kick out of some of the sketches, but you should be warned about the fact that this is not even close to the best Ferrell has to offer. For those people that have not had that much exposure to this comedian, I would suggest that you look elsewhere, there are many movies starring Ferrell that will provide you with more enjoyment and a better way to gauge his talent."
4,Ok,"I like Will Ferrell and SNL, but this wasn't as good as I had hoped. Some of the skits are on both DVDs."
3,There Should Have Been More COWBELL!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was a good SNL dvd but not the the best. There is a sketch that was not on Vol. 1&2 called ""The Juccuzzi Lifeguard.""It was when Jim Carrey hosted the show , infact it was the same time the Roxbury Brothers Sketch on this dvd. This one dies after a while asdoes John Belushi, Dan Akroyd , and Steve Martin Snl DVD's.The Best three are The Best of Eddie Murphy (5\5), Chris Farley (5\5), Phil Hartman (4\5). I recomend those because you don't have too be a fan of the show to like .... iccuse me, LOVE them!!!!"
1,snl will ferrel,not very funny very unusual for Mr. Ferrell. Not at all some of his funniest snl sits.
5,"The ""Best of"" them all!","I've watched nearly all of the ""The Best of..."" SNL cast members/guests, and this one is, hands-down, my absolute favorite! The same is true for my husband and brother as well. Tons of quotable stuff and hilarious skits, including some classics (i.e. ""...more cowbell!"") that just make you want to watch it over and over again!"
3,More Will Ferrell,"Its not that this kind of thing needs a review to know what to expect of it, but here goes.If u like the Ferrell you will like this for sure. I bought this for my girlfriend and watched it with her. It kept her entertained for a while but I noticed that the laughing was limited to a small portion of the skits. However, the few funny skits are worth the buy if you like Will Ferrell."
2,OK,"I am very pleased with the item I bought, however, I was very disapointed with the shipping and how long it took to get to me. I was very anxious to receive my item. I expected more from a top selling company. Thanks"
2,Best of? Must be a joke,"Where's Jingleheimer Junction, where's Osama messing with Texas, where's Behind the music with Neil Diamond, where's Inside the Actor's Studio with Tobey Maguire. And many others. Especially vol. 2 is a tragedy, there's a lot of mediocre stuff."
2,Disappointing Omissions,"As a big fan of Will Ferrell, I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunatley, there is very little content overall and his two funniest scenes ever were not included: the sketch where he is an ad exec and acts like a child and the sketch in which he is interviewing someone for a job at an in-flight magazine while berating and even assaulting his current employees. With all that capactiy, why are so few skits included?This seems to be a bit of a money grab by Mr. Michaels."
3,Disappointingly short and limited.,"I have no idea why they would put so little of his best stuff, or so little generally (72 minutes, including outtakes, dress rehearsal, tv appearances) onto a DVD. Did these people have anyone review these selections, or watch the whole thing, prior to releasing it? Doubt it."
3,Can't go wrong with Ferrell but this was disappointing...,"I love Will Ferrell as much as the next fan. He is a true comic genius, as demonstrated by his SNL audition (which is included on the DVD). However, I disappointed by the selection of skits included on the DVD -- there were so many other skits exponentially funnier than those included. As the other reviewers noted, it was a bit short & limited, and those that were included were funny (as you can't go wrong with Ferrell) but not ""the best"" as the title states.As a huge Will Ferrell fan though, I would still recommend it to other fans. Just don't expect ""the best."""
3,"Uneven, but funny","Certain sketches are just not funny, but the ones that are more than make up for it. The Harry Cary/Jeff Goldblum science sketch is hilarious; it was worth buying the whole DVD just for that one sketch."
2,Disappointing Selections from SNL,"In 2000, George Magazine voted Will Ferrell one of the 50 Most Influential People in Politics for his cutting impersonation of then Presidential hopeful George W. Bush. There's about 45 seconds worth of Bush on this disc. It does feature some of Ferrell's more memorable work, as Marty Culp, Craig the Cheerleader, and the frustrated Alex Trebeck. But missing, including the Bush impersonations, are many of the Janet Reno sketchs, full sketches of the Dysfuntional Family, Morning Latte, and more. Ferrell is a comic genius, however the producers of this disc are not doing him justice. This is a rental, not a purchase."
1,This is a HORRIBLE compilation !,"Will Ferrell might be the funniest man alive. His movies are great and some of the characters he has created are just too unique and brilliant to describe. HOWEVER, this horrid DVD gives you no indication of that. It is as if some secretary at NBC just randomly selected some skits and threw them together. Moreover, many of the skits are just bits where Ferrell plays a minor chracter in them. This DVD is also very brief. It just comes across like a rip-off. A DVD that ignores most of his funniest stuff, in order to get us to buy that later. Look, I love Ferrell and I will continue to watch and buy his movies. But I regret buying this thing, because it is weak!"
1,Don't bother,"I rented this movie, hoping it would be ""the best"" of Will Ferrell. I am very disappointed, out of about 15 sketches, only 2 were reasonable enough to watch.Will Ferrell is one of the best comedians in the USA, this dvd makes him look awful, he should've protested this garbage.Atleast they still show SNL reruns on tv still...."
2,Will Ferral?,Amazon service is fantastic but only some parts in the Will Ferrel DVD's were funny - nothing i would recommend to people!
1,Foul Ferrell,"Once upon a time Saturday Night Live was funny. Now they have the occassional amusing skit and the rare standout castmember. Will Ferrell is one of those standouts. Unfortunately, this DVD doesn't do him justice. Rather than a greatest hits collection, we're provided with a random sampling of Ferrell's skits and characters. This DVD would be more aptly titled Will Ferrell's Most Mediocre Moments."
1,Dont expect a lot,This was the first 'best of' that i have gotten from SNL. I was not impressed at all. It only had like 12 skits on characters he's played. I was expecting to sit down and see 30 skits. That didnt happen. Not really worth it.
3,Funny... but disappointing clips,"This DVD set was a let down. As always Will Ferrell is hysterical, but the selections of clips that were included in this DVD were disappointing. Only 1 celebrity jeopardy, no dog lawyer, no jingleheimer junction. Will Ferrell is a man of many funny talents, but I would have thought some of his funnier outtakes would be included."
5,BUY THIS DVD,"will ferrell is mad funny and whoever reads this should definitaley buy this DVD. It has all of his best work and the extra features are great.....watch his audition, its funnier than anything."
3,Not Enough,"Ferrell was such an important part of SNL. He had so many good sketches and characters. At 72 minutes, this dvd doesn't do him justice. It does have 1 skit of each of his major characters, but there are countless skits I remember that are left out. I realize that you can't have everything, but they could have made this a 2 hour dvd and filled it with more. The extras make this worth the buy though. I guess at the under $10 price makes it worth it overall."
5,scrumtrilescent,"This is a must have for any SNL fan, Will Ferrell fan, or anyone who finds mispronunciations of common last names to be as funny as I do. Responding to the previous review, the devil/Garth Brooks sketch is on the DVD, right between Inside the Actors Studio and Harry Caray. Also included are Celebrity Jeopardy and the Blue Oyster Cult ""more cowbell"" sketch, which is worth the money by itself. The DVD extras (Ferrell's audition, outtakes, and unseen sketch) are just as good as what was seen on TV."
3,Missing some of the funnier sketches of Will,"I agree with a lot of the reviewers about the sketches that were missing.Where is the sketch about Will having his children sing multiple times ""Happy Birthday"" to their grandmother on the phone? Where is Neil Diamond? Where is the yoga sketch where Will takes advantage of his extreme flexibility? Where is the faux commercial about the bottled water where one town goes and murders the other town in order to own the wonderful water (okay, not so funny, but edgy and interesting)?Will is a talent and can be both extremely funny and subversive. Unfortunately, we don't get enough of that in these DVD's."
4,Very funny!!,"Love Will Ferrell !! Just wish they would do more skits from the older 80's shows..""cheerleader"" skits. But worth the money!!"
2,Very disappointing Beware if you are looking for........,"I HAD been looking forward to purchasing this DVD so I could see Will do my favorite characters I thought he did.I was let down real fast.BE WARNED IF YOU WANT THE SAME.MY favorite by far is Bush. Here was my let down. YOU WOULD THINK LIKE I DID YOU WOULD GET AN ENTIRE BUSH SKIT. NOPE, YOU GET ONLY PART OF 1 & IT WAS NOT ONE THAT WAS REPLAYED BECAUSE IT WAS REAL GOOD. Nope, whoever's idea it was to do that made a major mistake.GOT a full skit of ""Jeopardy"" with the Connery & Reynolds being played. Really enjoyed seeing that.More cow bells is here.Inside the Actors Studio, the cheerleaders.I am just so let down about NOT an entire Bush skit.BADLY, BADLY DONE."
4,great delivery--thanks!,My son wanted to get this for his friend & they love it. Thanks for the quick delivery!
3,seems to work,I guess I won't really know unless something goes wrong......................I will update if the product gets put to the test.
5,Tripp Lite Review,"Fits well in the cabinet with enough protected outlets to cover all my components. With a $50,000 insurance policy for you components how can you lose."
5,Tripp Lite has great products,I purchased this Trip Lite Isobar for my son's new TV. It has plenty outlets for his other equipment and a great warranty if anything were to happen. I would recommend this product.
3,"Great color, soft materials - but not a very Grinch-like face","This is a nice stuffed toy. It seems to be constructed well, and I love the longer-fur accents on his hands, feet and head. I like that his arms and legs are long enough to put him in various poses (with support), and the color is really nice. However, I have to say that I was a little disappointed with this stuffed Grinch's facial detail. Our family utilized him as a tree-topper for a ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" themed tree, and it was hard to make out his facial expression at all as he sat atop the tree. I would have preferred an evil grin or an expressive frown instead of the bland smile that is stitched into his face, basically stitched too deep beneath his fur to even show."
3,Linguistic Science Fiction,"Perhaps not Scott's flashiest work, but thoughtful and as always with a perceptive eye on the interaction of technology and culture. A first contact novel worth reading. Various science fiction authors keep tabs on findings in various sciences -- most of them are interested in the ""hard"" sciences. This novel shows a lot of knowledge about the science of linguistics."
2,The Songs of Dwight Yoakam-Will Sing For Food,"I was expecting to hear Dwight. I was disappointed in all the offerings except the one by Gillian Welch. He is the best singer of his songs. The CD liner gives no information on the supposed ""Benefit for the Homeless"". Let's just hope it happened, the homeless benefitted, and continue to benefit from sales of the CD."
1,WAIT FOR X-BOX!,I thought this system was going to blow away my Dreamcast but the graphix are not that far off. The system is more powerful but the difference in not large enough to spend the money. I suggest that people wait for the X-BOX in order to compare. They will be releasing the same games as the PS2. Also if you are dying to get your hands on a new system now I suggest you purchase the DC. It is very affordable now and has enough games to hold you over until the fall. I should have waited myself.
4,Xbox Vs. PS2 (a fair review),"I agree the Xbox does have better graphics, (if not currently, then it will in the future) but if you're looking at the Xbox as a system keep in mind the number of games that are available. No where near the games that are out there for PS2. Plus you get backwards compatability with PS1 games. Also Microsoft is considering pulling the XBox out of japan, which roughly translates into the Xbox going down the drain. If you know anything about the gaming industry is that it all starts over there.For Longevity in the sence of the hardware that is in the console, then choose Xbox becuase it is definately more advanced than PS2For Longevity in the sense of constant new and creative developments then stick with the PS2. It will be around a long time!"
4,Not quite cruelty,"Artaud states that his version of The Cenci is not excatly what he envisions as the Theatre of Cruelty, yet he is toying with elements that are intrensic to his theory. Whether it's the translation or Artaud's stylistic choice, most of the text comes off as hokey, and incongrous with the action he requires. It's a great read to see the dificulties Artaud faced as he tried to make acceptable theater that remained in line with his theories, but one can imagine why the play, when produced, was a huge flop. For furthering one's (hopeful) understanding of Artaud it's imortant and worth reading, but does not have the bite or vision of The Spurt of Blood or There Is No More Firmament."
1,LPI FR-16 Laser Framing Square,i would not recommend this item to anyone. it is junk. the laser line does not appear except at the end of the project if there is a solid item in the assumed area for the dot only to show there is no line. it is useless and over rated in the description. do not be fooled as i was.
1,Can't calibrate mine.,"Right out of the box my unit's lasers were not aligned to the square and not orthogonal. No combination of turning the adjusting screws, tilting my head, or standing on one foot could make the laser parallel with the square, much less perpendicular to the other leg. Judging by the way the beam moves, I think the designers suscribe to the ""Let's wrap an O-ring around the laser and push on it a little to give the impression you can adjust it"" school of laser aiming. The trouble is, you can only loosen a screw so far. With no screw on the other side, you can't make it go past the point where screw loses contact. Buy this product if you feel lucky. Others have been. I wasn't."
2,Good but not what I needed,"The FR-16 Laser square does not put a line on the floor, only a dot on the wall. I needed a laser that puts a line on the floor.Nice product, just was not what I needed."
5,Everyone Needs This Thing!!!!,"I got the laser square from my father for my birthday about 6 months ago and wasn't quite sure what to do with it. Now I don't know what I would do without it. Everyone I know that used my laser square has either purchased one or borrows mine. We've built storage barns, garages, fences, retaining walls, & dozen other things with the laser square. As a side note the unit is also very durable, as my square has taken several falls & remains in excellent condition!"
3,what song????,"does anyone know what song is playing the first time you see grown up thurgood and co toking up? i believe that song is also in the scene where thurgood and co meet with sampson, while thurgood is pretending to be a jamiacan. if you know the band/artist post or email it to theblipsband@yahoo.commuch thanks"
4,"Good CD, could of been better, but still some great tracks","The Half Baked soundtrack is a great CD to own if you, like myself, are a big fan of the movie. My only problem with the CD are the ocassional songs that have remotely nothing to do with the movie at all, but I won't mention any names because instead I am going to list the track that are great. ""Along comes mary"" by the Bloodhound Gang, ""Virgin Girl"" by Smash Mouth and Chopper ""(I'm in love with) Mary Jane"" by Coolio and ""I get lifted"" by UB40 are all songs the soundtrack could not do without and any big fan of the movie will recognize all of them. Other noteable mentions are ""We Are Dumb"" by Home Grown, ""We Know"" by DJ Milo and Tricky, ""Pack The Pipe"" by The Pharcyde and ""Farmyard Connection"" by The Specials. Pick this up if you liked the movie, and if you didn't see the movie welllll what are waiting for?"
3,It's okay,"I just got the CD and it's okay. It has some good stuff but is missing the classic ""you be illin"" by Run DMC that the movie opened up with and is also missing the very groovy Salt & Peppa song that was played in the movie. I'm a little disappointed but it still has some good songs on it."
3,I wanna talk to Samson!,does anybody know if the Sir SmokeALot songs are available anywhere? Dave Chapelle is friggin hilarious.
4,Fast shipping and good product,Only issue is the lightbulb burned out within 3 days. And I only had it on for a few hrs each day. Otherwise it's a great tank for my Betta.
2,Light hood failed twice,"The light hood failed after two months of little use. The light was turned on for less than 1 hour a day. Marineland replaced it, and the second one also failed within two months. Marineland support is very poor and has stopped responding to my requests for another replacement. I have had many fish tanks and never had this type of problem. Be very wary of this tank."
5,nice tank,"This tank arrived promptly, well packed, easy assembly. The seamless style makes it so nice to view all items, front, sides and back!I got this for our Children's church, the kids and parents all love it.You can't go wrong with this one.I want another one for my home."
5,Love it!,"It's nice to look at, easy to clean and quiet! Very happy with the eclipse system, the filter is good and easy to change, as is the bio wheel. I highly recommend this aquarium."
3,Motor doesnt last that long but nice otherwise,"Right now I have 3 angelfish and 1 pleaco. I love that it is quiet and easy to maintain. Just change the filter and part of the water every month or so. Well, and feed the fish. I've never had a heater in it. It has kept a temp of about 77. I turn the light on when I'm at work and off when I leave. Must be the motor keeping it warm. Speaking of which the filter motor died last week, and I had to replace it. I love, love, love this tank! I got this tank as a gift about 3 or 4 years ago. It has been set up on my desk since I received it. I have had live plants and various fish. Sometimes a betta and a few corys."
4,"Great value, but some extra care needed for acrylic.","This tank is a pretty good value and comes with pretty much everything that is needed to get started. One thing that I have found is that acrylic scratches very easily. I received the tank with a pretty nice scratch in one of the sides, but didn't notice until I had water in it. It is not bad enough for me to return it, but I have added a few small scratches when i was cleaning it up with a paper towel. The paper towel left a few very small scratches where I wiped up some finger prints from my son. I was able to buff them out with a microfiber cloth and some elbow grease, but I can see this tank will take a little extra care than glass.On a side note, the tank does seem much clearer than glass and i like it because it is also weighs less than a glass tank."
5,Great for BETTA,"Love this tank for my betta, would recommend the least scratchy gravel so as not to scratch the tank (it's made of acrylic).Now for fish to put in: DO NOT use for normal school fish, goldfish, and other large-growing fish.1 Betta and a couple of ghost shrimp, or a snail... maybe a school of 5-6 neon tetras, or 5-6 glofish.this is a small tank, please do not crowd.As for goldfish, they grow enormous and a tank like this is just constricting and will stress them out.Please do not house goldfish in anything smaller than a 10 gallon tank for 2.Overall very happy!"
3,acrylic vs. glass,I have had two of these now ...first the 6..very nice..and then the twelve also nice.They are hard to clean though! I have some large fantail goldfish who have grown from small to 5 inches in this tank..i have some algae it's hard to clean acrylic..any suggestions.~
1,do not buy !,i've bought 3 marineland tanks and i've sent back 3 marineland tanks. literally a piece of junk. filtration is lousy. broken parts in all 3 tanks and a lot of work sending them back. take this review to heart. it's the real deal !
2,Nice Aquarium but very poor filtration,"I have two of these aquariums. One in each of our kids rooms. We loved the Hex shape and size of the tank. We filled each aquarium with distilled water. Each tank has one betta and two cory catfish. We have never been able to get clear water from either of these tanks. I am not impressed with the filter or bio wheel system. It provides little circulation and more water appears to go around the filter cartridge than through them. After waiting two months for the water to clear I plan to try an internal filter to see if I can get better results. I also tried the polishing pad and carbon bags idea but water remains cloudy. I've tested for ammonia, nitrites and nitrates and all appear normal."
4,Beware of pump,"Good tank, pump went out after 8 months. No luck finding the Hex5 replacement pump. Pet stores said they don't stock the pump."
4,"Easy set-up, nice little inexpensive tank.","I bought one of these for my desk at the office, and liked it so much that I bought one for home a few days later. Very simple set-up, with easy to understand instructions. So far it seems like it will be a low maintenance aquarium. The tank even comes with a little packet of water conditioner, and another of fish food, so it's basically a turn-key aquarium in a box. You can set it up in an hour, and put fish in it the next day.Be careful when filling the tank with rocks or gravel though, as the plastic it's made from is very easy to scratch. Also, you'll want to be sure that the plastic rim that acts as the frame for the filter/light assembly is in place before you fill the tank with water. This rim acts as a structural element, and helps to maintain the tank's shape when it's full of water. All in all, this aquarium seems like a good value for the money."
3,Good for simple fish keeping,"This is my first tank larger than 1 gallon (kept Bettas in those). I was impressed by the ""all-in-one"" kit. This has not been as good as it sounded. Adding things, like a heater, is not easy. You have to completely dismantle the hood (base hood piece, filter, filter cover, light cover, and light) in order to work in the tank. It is a good tank for limited space. I will continue to use it, but will add a larger tank (15-20 gallons)and purchase the parts separately."
1,This is the worst aquarium,"I bought this item less than 6 months ago, and have gone through two motors for the filter. Every time I try to contact the company, they do not respond back. I am giving it to the trash gods!! DO NOT BUY this item if you dont want to have to replace the motor every 3 months. I am very disappointed in this tank. I didnt even want to give it one star but I had to to leave my review.krysten sullivan"
2,fish tank kit,"I was upset because there was no ""starter kit"" included with food and tap water conditioner, as the description clearly stated that there would be.It's too much of a pain to return the whole thing just for those small items. So, I am not satisfied with the purchase."
1,Did not receive item,"I never received the Aquarium ordered on the 20th March. I am very diappointed and so is my granddaughter, as it was an Easter present to her.I have written to Absolutely Pets and they claim it got lost in the post and promised it would arrive 1 to 2 weeks later. Still waiting.Paymnet has been takenDaniel Crowley"
1,terrible wouldn't recoment,This product is terrible the bio filter doesn't even turn. Unfortunately I bought it but didn't set it up for awhile and now its too late to return it. It looks nice but dead fish don't and with out the wheel turning not enough air gets into the water. I've had the fish that are in there for over two years in another tank so its definately the tank thats the problem
1,Quite enough for beginners...or maybe even not?,"Im not an expert but is not muy first tank, I bought this one to replace an old one. This is what i found:I choosed the Hex because the design. But if you want to keep fish and develop an aquarium this is not the option for you.Hard to clean the acrilics due to hex designThe opening/lid is very small. It can only be used to feed the fishAcrylic scratches easily, and is impossible to cover up once scratchedThe Filter is crappy, the water was cloudy, tried changing the cartridge and last for 3 weeks with only one fish !!! even doing partial changes of water every week. Had to modify the top to install again my aquaclear filterMy fish don't seem happy in this tank. maybe if you bought guppies and neon tetras or a single Goldfish would work wellTo finish my review after 6 months of being with the hex eclipse Im desperately need a new tank!!"
2,Filter System Burns Out,"I had this fish tank for a while now. I had one betta living in it and cleaned it and changed the filter regularly. After a few months however the motor for the filter started to make a really loud noise, and stopped running. It seams to have overheated its own plastic and warped the filter casing.I tried to have it replaced it but amazon told me to contact the manufacturer and marineland wouldn't replace it since I hadn't bought it directly from them. I got new parts for the filter(impeller and impeller housing)from petco but those burned out quickly as well.In conclusion: A nice sized tank for a betta, okay and convenient at first, but the filters burn out quickly and they charge a lot to replace each piece."
4,The Easy Aquarium,"I'll start off by saying I own this tank and am happy with it. The filtration system, once established with beneficial bacteria, is very effective. I tend to push the limit a bit with stocking (while making sure the fish have plenty of room) and I never have a problem with my ammonia, nitrate, or nitrite levels being out of whack - I attribute this to the excellent filtration. The tank is spacious for it's size and is attractive as well. My only problem is with the lighting, it's very dull and doesn't illuminate the tank very well (you could try a white substrate which will help the tank look brighter). It is also unsuitable for a planted tank if you want a wide variety of plants. I got around this by using plants that are good in low light as well as adding a Hagen Co2 system."
5,good little tank,I have used this tank for about two years for my daughter's fish. I'm writing this review mainly to offset the other reviewer who had to return her tanks- I've returned one because it developed a slow leak. I contacted Marineland via email and they shipped out a new tank- I did not have to return the leaking tank to the store or to them. Best of all I was able to effortlessly transition the fish from one tank to the next. Marineland's customer service is great and have certainly inspired me to write this review!
4,Easy and attractive for first-time fishkeeper,"Let me begin by saying I've never been interested in keeping fish. Ever. Aquariums seem like a huge hassle to me. But then our daughter was given a goldfish as a birthday party favor (don't get me started on my annoyance at that episode!) and in the interest of keeping the poor critter alive, we trudged to the pet store to see what we would need. A fishbowl looked like a slow but certain death sentence for Swimmy, so we sprung for this pretty little three-gallon Eclipse tank. Setup was very easy. All we needed to buy was some gravel, fake plants and of course a castle, and water conditioner. We've had Swimmy living in his new home for about a week now, and he seems happy and active. The bright lamp keeps the tank plenty warm, so we have not bothered about finding a heater. All in all, we are pleased with our first aquarium and first pet."
5,Useless Review?...,"[...]Plants and gravel sold separately. Be sure that all plants or gravel you by are intended for solely aquarium use.A good rule is an inch of fish per gallon of water.Pure, dechlorinated water is the only type that should be used, I don't know if that (Sparkletts, etc.) water has chlorine...Saltwater aquarium-keeping is a totally different ballgame, with quite a bit of different equipment needed then just this tank. It's much more than just a tank with salt added. Also much more unforgiving of mistakes and many times more expensive.A gravel vaccuum (siphon) is used to ""vaccuum"" the substrate (Not an automatic vaccuum. They look like 6-foot long, clear, plastic, hoses. Fairly cheap, $3-$25.Algae should not grow unless you keep the aquarium in the way of direct sunlight or keep the lights on constantly.Quarantining? It would be a wise precaution, though not COMPLETELY necessary.Hope this helps :)"
4,Happy Puffers,I bought this aquarium for my 3 Dwarf Puffers. The filtration system is amazing. I couldn't change water for about a month or so due to morning sickness but it kept the water clean. I love it! My DP's love it too!
3,nice filter soso design,"We have smaller Marineland tanks that have much better designs. Honestly, I was quite disappointed in the hood design. The hood is not hinged and is a complete pain to move around for water changes & such. The feeding opening came broken (the little pegs that hold it in place are so tiny that they must just snap off) it is farther back on the tank & very hard to navigate if the tank is raised.Boo hiss!"
4,Faulty filter?,"I just purchased the 3 gallon tank of this for my female betta. It's cute and has lots of space. However if you fill the tank past the line as indicated by the directions, the water will leak out from the rim. In order to get the bio-wheel going, you have to follow the directions exactly. Make sure everything's in place and then you'll see the wheel start spinning. So far it's a great place to home any small fish you might have...my only complaint is that the filter is too noisy. Maybe my filter's just faulty or something. I don't know about any other customers who've had this problem. :) But that's an easy fix so it's not so bad. Overall pretty good for the price!"
4,Salt Water Nano Great Starter,I bought this tank with the idea of making a small salt water tank to sit in my office. It was very easy to set up and with some basics I was on my way to building a small reef. I would recommend!
2,"Cute tank, filter doesn't last","I had the same experience as the previous reviewer. I had this tank for almost a year and then the filter motor stopped working. The filter is made specifically for this shape of tank and they don't sell it seperately.I found an alternate filter that works in this tank. So, if you've had the same problem with this tank, do a search for Tetra Whisper 3i In-Tank Filter."
2,poor company,"I own this and many other aquarium's. I liked the size and the fact that the filter is hidden. What I did NOT like was that after 3 months, the motor burned up in a power outage! I contacted the company about warranty - no response, I contacted the company to purchase a replacement motor - no response. I can't find the replacement anywhere - you are much better off buying a product that you can replace parts to in the event that something goes bad. Becuase that is not the case with this product, I had some very unhappy fish - and now have a useless tank. Buyer beware - this company clearly doesn't need your business, nor do they need to return customer questions / concerns. I'd suggest throwing your money elsewhere!"
1,What good is something that keeps breaking?,"Perhaps I simply have bad luck. When I bought this tank, I loved it. I put it in my boy's room and it was nice and quiet and easy..... until it broke. I took it back to the petco I bought it at, they gave me a new pump....which also did not work.I have the manual and I'm putting this thing together right, but it's not working! In the meantime, some of the fish died, and my son is pretty sad about it all.Next time I'm going for one of the old fashioned loud filters that at least last you a couple of years."
2,Dont Bother,"These systems are a piece of CRAP! Save your money and buy an aqueon if you have the space for a 10 gallon. I purchased this system for my daughter for her birthday and had it about 3 months before it just quit. I purchased about $50 dollars worth of replacement parts for it and got it to (sort-of) work but then needed a new motor. So I purchased the hood and then the new bio-wheels (I bought 3 of them) wouldnt work because they changed the design and they dont sit properly. Then the impeller needed replacing. After all of this, still nothing but a broken tank and $50 worth of replacement parts that I COULDNT USE. I finally just gave up and purchased the aqueon 10 gallon kit which is WAY more user friendly. I have had it set up for just over a month now and so far so good!"
1,Water Filter stopped working after a week,I don't recommend this Aquarium. The water filter is noisy and broke after a week. It was a waste of money.
2,Disappointed...,"I bought this aquarium based on the outstanding reviews. I've had it for 6 months now and I have to say that I'm disappointed. When I first opened the box a piece was missing... I called the company and they did send me the piece free of charge, but it made me late getting the tank started and it was a gift for my son. I've also had pieces break... the hood that lifts broke off at the hinge and the light has never worked right- we have to bang on it to get it to work and sometimes that doesn't work. Other that that I guess its okay, but nothing special that I can tell. This is my first aquarium so I'm no expert, but I would probably have bought a less expensive tank had I not read such great reviews on it."
3,The tank had been opened and was broken,We bought this for our son's birthday. When he opened the box we realized it had already been opened and taken out. The lid was broken. I have emailed customer service and I'm still waiting on an answer. I would say were are not happy with our purchase.
2,BAD PACKING!!!,"got 2 of these both came to me damaged,sent first one back and ordered a 2nd oneand guest what i GOT this one was broken toobecause cause it was BAD PACKING!!!CALLED MARINELAND and THEY TOOK CARE OF EVERYTHINGAT NO CHARGE TO ME AT ALL.now i love it!!!BIGJIM"
2,Love the tank hate the filter,I have had this tank 2 times and each time i have had major issues with the filter. The first one never seemed to pull the water correctly and the water had to be at the highest in order to function. My new one after is once again about a year old and i have called the company 3 times to help with filter issues and again it isn't functioning..... i'm glad i kept that new filter i got to replace the last faulty one. The light size and shape are excellent though as long as you have only a few fish.
5,Perfect Desktop Aquarium,"Marineland makes the hobby of keeping an aquarium simple and carefree. The ""Eclipse Hex 5"" takes up little room on my desk. While working on my computer or watching TV, I can enjoy watching my tropical fish. Just remember not to overcrowd your fish. Just 5 or 6 small (1"" to 1 1/2"") fish should be the maximum. Changing the filter is simple. Setup is a breeze. Quiet operation. I would highly recommend this to anyone!"
3,"Good tank, but not as quiet as the older Eclipse tanks","Eclipse aquarium excels in filtration, as always, however, comparing to my 2 other Eclipse aquariums (a 6 gallons and a 3 gallons) I bought more than 5 years ago (still running very well), this new 3 gallons Eclipse aquarium has a stronger filter and creates louder sound. I gave it 3 stars because it still performs well in filtration, keeping the water crystal clear, but the faster filter motor making some louder noise is not as good as the older Eclipse versions.All being said, I am very grateful to get an Eclipse tank at all, after searching for it in vain at stores and found that Eclipse was discontinued by Marineland and was replaced by the Classic (which got reviews saying that it is really loud).So, I'm still happy to get a new Eclipse. Eclipse is the only tanks I found reliable and nice in small sizes."
3,Decent,"I use the 3 gallon aquarium for my Betta fish. He loves it, it provides enough swim room and the filter works great, is quiet and isn't too strong. My fish even likes to swim under the waterfall it creates. The light works great and really illuminates the tank.Dislikes:*You have to fill the water almost to the top for the filter to work.*The light it came with worked beautifully but has burned out after a month of use for 8 hours a day.*The feeding panel at the top opens up to show the filter and barely leaves enough room to drop food into the water. I have decided not to use it and instead lift off the top to feed my Betta.*The plastic had some major scratches when the tank arrived, when you fill the tank with water you don't notice the scratches as much."
3,great starter tank,"I would have given more stars except the 5 gallon tank that I received was missing the sample food and water conditioner. The tank is easy to set up, and my male Betta is happy in his new environment."
1,Didn't make it to Valentine's Day,"My son loves his goldfish, and we were touched when he wrote Santa for a new home for Teppo. Because Teppo's a fish, and fish can't write, Santa. Well, guess what: Teppo's filter pump didn't last to Valentine's day. No response whatsoever from the manufacturer. It's a little too easy to call it a cheap, imported piece of Chinese junk, because who imported it? Behind every inferior piece of imported garbage is a derelict American company."
4,Fantastic so far!,Recently set up my tank & it's awesome. This is my first tank ever but yet I was able to put it together by myself and get everything working in minutes. Took me way longer to fill and rinse the decor. It's easy to follow the instructions and runs so quietly you wouldn't know it's in the room aside for its so pretty it draws the eye. I have no complaints so far!! It did come with a single filter and everything pops into place no problem. The biowheel spins easily and I've got everything going and Flame my betta is exploring his new home today. See images for a pic. Hope he loves his new home as much as I do. I bought lots of marina betta materials to fill it up and designed sort of a little zen aquatic garden for him. (4stars cause I love it- I would give 5 but I'm only basing this off 2days of performance).
5,no complaints,good solid tank. no complaints.easy to clean and operate and a really complete system. i would highly recommend this product.
1,"Good idea, flawed execution","I got this because it seemed like the easiest way to get a fish tank up and running.Initially, it was.Four months after I started the tank the light fixture in the hood broke.The company replaced it.Four months later, it broke again. Eleven days after contacting the company, while I was still waiting to hear whether they would replace it again, the pump broke. So now I need to try to quickly rehome the fish before the oxygen levels in the tank start dropping.My aquarium system has now become an expensive and oddly shaped tank that will effectively house no more than a betta.I wish I had bought separate components so if something failed I could replace it with a product from another company. This kind of product only works when all the components keep working. I will certainly never purchase any marineland product again."
2,"great size, not quality though","I love the size and shape of this aquarium but that is it. It scratches easily, not very good plastic material for the clear sides. Also the filter system broke on this after 6 months. I looked into getting a replacement filter system, but it costs only 5 dollars less then getting the entire aquarium set up. I am just going to throw it out and start over."
2,scratches easily and light button broke,I am not impressed with this product. It scratches very easily and I am even extra careful with it.THe light button broke in less than one year and the company can not even get back to me about the warranty.Two stars because I like the design but it just is not executed very well. It is also hard to put the food in the littleslot. Changing water is also a chore because you have to take the whole lid off and it drips water (condensation) whendoing so. Just messy and shoddy quality from a company that has zero customer service.
2,"Alright, but not satisfactory.","I bought this tank for my comet. The filter would do something weird; this happened twice, it stopped working for like a day, then went back to working. The filter was pretty crappy, anyways. My tank was always cloudy, and the light broke. Luckily, my Dad managed to turn the light fixture around, and the other side had another socket.All in all, I ended up just getting a ten gallon, and so far it's working out better. I wouldn't reccomend this tank to anyone intending to keep big fish."
5,Great tank,"This tank is quiet, has a great shape, keeps my water crystal clear and seems much bigger than 12 gallons. I highly recommend it."
5,Marineland Aquarium review - great aquarium!,"This aquarium is a great size - good for people who don't want to give up a lot of space for fish or get too serious about fish. It is perfect for our one betta fish, though more could fit. When we transfered the betta from the bowl aquarium to this one, he came alive and has swam back and forth constantly ever since.It has a filter and a light. The filter keeps the water clean for at least a month, and the light creates a great showcase to view. It is like having a piece of art on the counter."
2,Fish die in this tank,"Your water will be sparkling, the gentle sound of the water wheel is relaxing, it's a beautiful tank, but you just can't keep anything alive in it! I have fish in mulitple tanks ( different brands )and they do beautifully, but anything I put in this tank is dead within a 2 month period. Crazy. This tank is not cheap, but there is something wrong. As I write this there is a poor fish gasping it's last breath in that stinking tank. I guess I am out the money because I will not put another fish in that tank only to watch it die a slow and painful death. It's a beautiful fishy coffin. If I sound ticked off it's because I am ticked off. Buy something else."
4,bad ship!,If you are out of USA and ship with Transexpress please dont buy this because the ship value is 374$ :S and the item just 87$ but the Eclipse 12 look cool!
4,"Tuff, Deep House Grooves","This CD came as a pleasant surprise to me. I had never heard of Oliver Stumm as a DJ, but sometimes a shopper has to take a chance; I took this chance based on the record label, and I got lucky. The mix is very fluid and deep. Favorite tracks are ""Live In Unity"", ""Nobody's Business"", and ""This Is The Only Way"", simply because I heard those very often during my stint in the UK. Although not an absolute favorite, it is still a good CD to have in the collection."
3,It depends what you like,"The album is not bad.There is about 5 really god songs the other 10 are bellow average.The sound is also bellow average,it's some kind of modern reggae sound,it's not really roots and it's not really dancehall.But if you like songs of Jah and afcourse Morgan heritage you are gonna like the album,this is only my personal opinion and it doesnt have to be right."
5,good CD,"My favorite song is Down In The Park, so I bought this CD basically just for that reason. It is a good version of that song, but the other songs are great as well. If you like Gary Numan, you'll love this album."
4,Only for the 20th Anniversary Editions,"This album is good for huge fans of Gary Numan, and actually makes a perfect gift for that Gary Numan fan you know, as they more than likely don't own this piece. Don't get this CD for the Dominion Day single; get it for the 20th Anniversary Editions. They're modernized versions of some of Gary Numan's best. Despite being live, these tracks really shine especially Metal and Voix."
2,Fix the songs,"the songs are wrong in your system song 3 is actually song 5, and song 5 is actually song 6, people are hearing the wrong songs"
3,Inconsistent readings...defective?,"This scale was entirely inconsistent. I used it for a few days before deciding to return it. I tried everything, including different surfaces and fresh batteries, but time after time I got inconsistent readings even when stepping on the scale several times within minutes! I actually NEVER got the same reading twice on this scale unless I tried more than 3 or 4 times in a span of a few minutes. Maybe I just got a defective one? I am tempted to try it again, though, because it is a good price, and I have a few other Homedics products with no problems. I give it a neutral 3 stars because the price is great and I probably just got a defective unit."
1,Awful,"It is by far the worst scale that I have ever bought. It is not accurite. I have seen some scales that were a little off, but this one never tells you the right weight. I wish I had listened to the other reviews, and not bought this scale."
5,bought for daughter,Bought this for my daughter who now lives in another state. She was asked to become the church pianist and needed some refresher information. She was excited to get it.
2,a personal journey indeed,"This book is the story of a very personal journey of identity and authenticity. It contributes to the multicultural understanding of modern America. I could not always understand the author's sentiments and emotions, but I do not doubt his sincerety. It certainly caused me to question whether I have been true to, and sufficiently respectful of, my own race - the author's emphasis on the need for authentic expression of one's bloodline is compelling."
3,Where does personal experience end and religion begin?,"An illustration of the highly personal nature of religious experience. If you have struggled to relate the scripture of a spiritual tradition to your life there is something to appreciate here, but not the insight that one might be hoping for."
2,Doctor Who?,"I am a fan of British television but this did not measure up. I heard a lot of good things about this show, it even has a cult following, but it lacked the whit and creativity I have seen from the BBC. Simply not impressed. And the fact that the main characters switch so often makes me not want to follow it, this guy is not James Bond."
4,Doctor Who Season 1 is not bad,I watch this when I don't have anything else recorded that I want to watch.I find Amazon TV programs harder to search than Netflix. Cumbersome.
5,I adore this show!,I've been going through the other reviews... and not being a Dr. Who expert (I remember seeing the old ones here and there on PBS as a kid) anything I say will have been said already. What I will say is I love it... and can't wait for the Series One DVD to come out here in the States.I think my favorite part about this is that they DIDN'T go over the top with special effects (which is what would have happened if an American company had gotten ahold of the idea to remake it). I'm glad the creatures are a little on the low-fi side... not all super CGI'd up. It would have ruined the whole thing. ... its the kitsch that makes this show so fun!
3,Reconsidered......,"I've revised my original review.The general quality of the show, the writing, the acting and the plots have overwhelmed my criticisms of the alien effects and I'm totally on board with this new Doctor.Long may he travel in that beautiful blue box."
2,Falls a long way short of Classic Who,"I grew up watching Doctor Who and was quite looking forward to Chris Eccleston's interpretation. I wasn't prepared for such poor quality writing, and it became quite obvious that Chris Eccleston didn't really relate to the character. Billie Piper has two facial expressions and is by far the worst companion the Doctor has ever had. The stories are mostly borrowed from such things as Pigs In Space and The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe. There is very little originality, imagination, or respect for the original Who concept. Plus, the monsters are extremely un-scary. Overall, this is possibly the worst season of Doctor Who and is best ignored."
1,I am not amused,"I watched this last night, on a DVD rented from netflix, and I must say I am fairly dissapointed. I'm glad I didn't buy it, because it really is not worth the price to own this piece of dreck. The effects are awful, even worse than the old (and fun) Doctor Who. The sets in a Godzilla movie are more convincing than the sets here. Billie Piper has the acting talent of a soup can. And it was racist of them to put in the cowering black guy. At best buy it costs $84.99. It hardly looks like BBC had that budget. Obviously made for kids, but we can give them a little credit here! I hope primeval is better."
5,The new Dr. Who is better than the original.,My father was a fan of the original series. I watched many an episode with him. I loved the premise of the show. The new series is so much better in my opinion because it has the heart of the original with the technology and dark humor of today. Makes for a great combo. Billie Piper is great as his side kick/partner. She is more than a match for the Doctor. She (her character) is what was missing in the old series. Great work BBC!!
5,FANTASTIC!,"An incredible way for the Doctor to return. From the first episode, to the climatic shocking end of the series I was on the edge of my seat. The bigger budget allowed the producers to do so much more to add to the quality of the production. Christopher Ecclecston is excellent as the dark, brooding Doctor. Billie Piper is among the best of the show's companions as the adventurous Rose. This series will be great fun for any Doctor Who fan."
4,The big BBC revival,"The ""Time Lord"" is reborn in the modern BBC series.This result is sort of like Dr Who the next generation.It is humorous and interesting: a fun sci fi show that mostlyyou can let the kids watch too.This set of dvd's is the first season of mayhemand time and space travel in a telephone booth.It certainly beats most American / Hollywood sci fi series of latewhich seem to have a dreadful dark and vampire type approach."
