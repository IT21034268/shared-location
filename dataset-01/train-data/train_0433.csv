2,Disappoints.,"I found it disappointing. it is very difficult to use - the narrative flow wanders and is unfocused. Generally, the book seems to be structured into alternating sections of about 5 pages of rambling background, followed by about 5 pages of palpation instructions. After a while we learned to just skip over the rambling background completely. The palpation instructions are deliberately designed to make multiple ""tours"" of a each body area, but providing just a little bit more information on each tour. The result is a tedious repetitive series of exercises, which is frustrating and irritating rather than supportive and enriching. Additionally, we found there were frequently instructions to locate and isolate structures that aren't readily isolated on most people - terres major and minor, and many others.The accompanying DVD is very good. But it doesn't correct or compensate for the shortcomings of the text."
3,A beautiful book with a big flaw,"(This review is for the book ""Trail Guide to the Body"" 3rd Edition by Andrew Biel.)Since this book has only received 5-Star positive ratings to date (about 26 of them), there is no need for me to go into all the great features it contains.However, this book has a big flaw. The text and captions to the drawings on every single page (and there are nearly 400 pages!) have a very light (i.e., pale) print, almost light gray. And the font is small and thin too. This makes this book quite hard to read for some people. In fact, it is so tiring to read that you will not be referring to it that much. What a disaster, ruining such a beautiful book! Shame on you editors/printers! What happened to quality control?"
4,thanks,was glad to get this as soon as I did...Thanks for the job well done and greatly appreciated for study
5,Trail Guide to the Body,My son requested this as part of his schooling and future career and it is exactly as he expected and is pleased.
5,super excellent users guide!,"Good illustrations not to simple and just enough detail for getting to know your body. I you want to know what your massage theripist or physical therpist is doing or taking about, this your book."
4,just what I expected,Helpful guide in great condition- the diagrams are useful for upper level high school and college students alike. Easy to follow.
5,Wonderfull!!,"Once again had no issues with delivery, was absolutely satisfied and hope you all have the same experience."
5,Do you need to practice palpation in musculoskeletal system?,"This book covers basic needs -for medical massage as well as physical therapy students education- in the learning procedure of palpation of the human body surface. Valuable and easy to memorize tips. Very good for direct use in the class. My recomendation for training ""anatomy in vivo"" for class in medical massage therapy. We will use it as a standard book in our school"
5,This book has all the info a physical therapist needs.,"This book covers it all muscles, bones, synergists, antagonists and so much more. All the information a bodyworker needs is available. The diagrams are clear and concise, giving action, origin and insertion as well as the innervating nerve and how to palpate, awesome!! The only downside is that it takes a little while to figure out how to find it, it can be a little cumbersome. That aside any bodyworker should have a copy of this book. I often find myself giving information to instructors!!"
4,Must have!,"I am able to feel the body better after I got this book. Yes, it's a MUST HAVE guide for the massage course. The DVD is an excellent guide except that the volume on the DVD is really soft, not sure if any of you have such problem?"
5,Great Reference Book,"Probably one of the easiest/well written books for reference that I have come across. I am a Homeopath and this book has come in very handy for checking complaints. I can see where a it would be invaluable for a masseuse, rolfer, etc. Happy with purchase, wish I had come across it sooner!"
5,Fantabulous!,"Absolutely wonderful book for any bodywork/ or A/P student. Easy to understand, clearly pictured & grouped for quick reference. Have to agree w/other reviewers' that this is one of the best books for learning the human body. Sketches show instertions/origins and is written in an easy to understand format. Muscles/bones are ""highlighted"" w/in the body, making it easy to envision the location. Flash cards are very helpful too. Found it better than my $200 college text : )"
3,"A bit better than version #1, but still not excellent","This game could be a five star game if the programmers would just do one thing. ADD MORE QUESTIONS! The lower-level questions just plain repeat themselves too often.The game does as much justice to the TV show as a computer game could do. That is why I am happy with it. The lifelines usually help you out, but you still have to use your judgement. I guess that it really is the next best thing to being there.I love the TV show, and this game is fun to play, but only until you start getting the early questions over and over again.Plus, it lacks one other feature that the 1st version also lacks. You can't skip parts that you have seen before, which you would love to skip over. Every time that you start up the game you have to sit through a somewhat annoying introduction.It's still worth buying, but not at the current price ... ..."
5,Color It Great!,"Low priced and carefully shipped, I was very happy with the DVD and where I purchased it from. The product speaks for itself because it's Streisand. The rest of the experience was a good one and I was pleased!"
2,Wrinkle free? Not quite.,"These fit well and seem well made.However, the claim they make in the description that they're wrinkle free is a joke!These wrinkle worse than any other pants I own.I can put a clean dry pair on, sit down in a chair for five minutes, and then stand up and the result is the front being covered with unsightly wrinkles that don't go away."
2,Parents--some illustrations may be inappropriate,"Just a word to parents--if you are buying this for a young person, you might want to be aware that there are some sexually provocative images and at least a few nude drawings in this book. Look at it in a bookstore before buying so that you know exactly what is inside. I decided to send mine back for this reason--I wish Amazon had provided more description.I know other reviewers may rant and rave and call me rude names, but to me this is about informed buying and freedom of choice. Teens whose hormones are already raging are assaulted with sexual images every day by the media--as a parent, there's no way I am going to add more fuel to the fire."
1,The 9th Directive,"Rarely did I start a book and couldn't finish it, this is the one! The plot of the story line is totally obsolete in today's political environment for a spy story, and it's also the first time I did not like the main character in a book-Quiller. From the beginning of the book he already showed his big ego towards his boss, because he had small feet. What a joke! And he himself made some miscalculation too, not a likable man to me. It hard to continue a book if you don't like a main character in a book. More important, had I had found out it was written in 1966, I would not have picked it up.Like the other viewer said, it'll go to the charity pile."
1,Not a good book!,"Seattle Mariners by Paul Joseph is a rip-off! I'm very disappointed in the fact that the information inclosed, in this book, is dated. I'd thought I'd be getting a current book of the Mariners 2001 season. I should have been suspect when there wasn't the opportunity to view the inside of the book and there were no reviews or ratings by buyers available."
1,Photo Paper,"I own a cannon photo printer and this paper suck's with this printer,I may work well wit kodak printer but not with cannon."
1,Buyer,"This product is good at all, it is very thick. I don't recommend to buy this item.The print quality is also not good."
2,Has too much red shift,"I purchased this paper in the 25 pack as an experiment for my HP D110 printer. The results for portraits is too much red hue. Regardless of how much I remove the red in photoshop I still get a red hue on skin tone.I cannot give this 1 star because I do not know if the D110 combined with this paper is a good or bad combination. Currently however, this paper did not work well with this printer.Printing on plain non-photo paper the results were better.Your mileage may vary depending on your printer."
1,Corporate Greed Hits Photo Paper,"The paper bleeds the ink, and you end up with mud. The other person who in their review said it is worse than plain paper is 100% correct. Ignore anybody who says they got decent results, because the wouldn't know decent results ...I just got off the phone with a Kodak Customer Care Supervisor. He kept blathering on about a ""compatibility issue"". I kept explaining that the packaaging states ""compatible with ALL inkjet printers"".I told him this is not a ""compatibility issue"" but rather a CREDIBILITY issue. They are knowingly marketing garbage, saying it can do something that it can't. ... like Snake Oil. I asked if he would send me a package of ""Kodak Picture Paper"" to make up for my wasted money. He said no. I said ""so you're telling me tough luck"" He said, ""Uh-huh""I don't like to deal with corporate attitudes like that, so now I won't buy the ""Kodak Picture Paper"" either."
2,DON'T BUY FOR CANON PRINTERS!,"Both of Kodak's ""3-star"" glossy and matte finish photo paper is just not up to par with any canon paper. The final product leaves way more reddish tint on faces that has to be corrected. The thin paper just doesn't say ""quality""."
2,Huge Let Down Kodak,"If you are looking for a nice glossy, thick sheet of inkjet paper this is not the one. It is about half the thickness of the other quality inkjet photo papers. This is more like a glossy presentation paper then what a glossy photo paper is supposed to be. Nice bright white with the kodak logo all over the back. The glossiness is more akin to a satin paper rather then other glossy papers. So if you want a satin gloss presentation paper this is good stuff but for glossy photo paper it is well below average, go get some Kirkland glossy photo paper, get quality prints on quality paper for a reasonable price."
1,Kodak photo paper NOT Gloss!,"I ordered Kodak photo paper, as you described on your web site ... it was supposed to be glossy finish, and it is not. It is a matte finish, and I really don't like it, but what could I do? Spent good money, now I have to hunt elsewhere for the correct product."
1,Don't waste you money!,"I bought this item thinking it would be a medium quality photo paper. I don't know why Kodak even makes it; the print quality is poor, and the paper is way too thin. I will never make this mistake again!"
1,Not good!,"On the packing it says ""This KODAK Paper can be used in any conusumer inkjet printer"". True! It doesn't say it will produce good results. The output is dark and bluish on my HP printer. It looks dirty and dull! Maybe there is some printer out there it suits! Not recommended!"
4,Thin but flexible.,"This photo paper may be thin but for making CD inserts, it is just about perfect. Good printing surface and flexible enough to fold without difficulty. I have bought a second pack of 100 just because it works so well for this purpose."
4,Pretty decent,"I own a really good printer, a Canon Pixma, and this paper works well for me. It's a bit thin, but i'm just printing off photos for scrapbooking, so the thickness doesn't matter much. Good paper for the price!"
4,Interesting...:),"This next installment to the teen horror series, Cirque du Freak. In this book, Darren is suspicious that Mr. Crepsley might be the cause of several murders in town that are seemingly the cause of a vampire. To make matters worse, Crepsley refuses to talk to Darren about this, and is gone more and more lately. Finally Darren and Evra decide to take matters into their own hands: to follow Mr. Crepsley, and even stop him, if that's what it takes...Readers will enjoy the addition of a new antagonist, the vampaneze. This is a break from classic vampire literature, and makes the book all the more interesting. Debbie adds an interesting blend of romance to this novel that was missing in the first two books. More unpredictable than the others, also, even though it is one of those books where you can't really predict because not all of the characters are introduced in the first two chapters, etc."
4,Pretty good,"I think that this book was o.k..It had its ups and downs but it is mostly good. The thing i like about this book is that it is really easy to read and has a pretty good storyline. Something i didnt like though is that is was a bit slow, unlike the 2 books before it. Make sure you read the other 2 books before you read this one or else it wont make sense. i give it a 9 out of 10."
3,It was a somewhat forgettable read.,It held my attention enough to read all three of the first trilogy- the three are connected - can't really just read one and expect to have a whole story. Each book feels like a chapter in a larger story. I think the central character's character lacked sufficient character for me to care about him. And frequently there was a bleakness without ambiance... it just felt like a dry read that I forced myself to finish because I bought all three of the first trilogy at the same time and was curious to see if I ever came to care about the story. But I left if with no desire to carry on with this writer.
1,darren shan is too annoying,the author might be trying to make darren a boy with a sense of righteousness and goodness. but he also made him a stupid boy. this is the last book i would read from this author. the plot is too stupid!and if you are buying it for your kids. this book is too violent for a kid in opinion.
4,tunnels of blood,"Darren and Evera go to the big city for a vacation. Then a vampanezewhich is a vampire killer, starts killing a bunch of people in the town. The vampaneze will either kill evra or Darrens "" girlfriend"" and Darren chooses his girlfriend. Darren was being very clever and smart and told his girlfriend and her family to sleep in the shed and he replaces his girlfriend with a sheep. The vampaneze is extremely shocked and when he was staring at the sheep with amazment. Darren comes from behind and kills him. Than from there on Darren is very safe where ever he goes but he is unfortunatly a half vampire."
5,the big mistake,"What a great book, in it darren makes a mistake which could have started one of the hugest wars in history between the vampires and vampanese. the mistake was going into the tunnels of blood. Mr Krepsley and darren meet a vampanese named Murlough. i give this book 5 stars because it was imposible to put down it makes you feel as if your in a different world..............THEIR WORLD. this book is the best book you will have read and will ever read. God bless and also BUY THIS BOOK. :-)"
5,Great Books,"The Saga of Darren Shan is, quite simply the greatest young adults' book series since K.A. Applegate's Animorphs. After I read the first book in the series, Cirque du Freak, I couldn't help but order the other books that were out in England. I'm to Book 7 now and I can't wait for the others to come out. The reason I'm writing this review is because Tunnels of Blood wasn't my favorite, but the series really picks up in Book 4. So for those of you who might lose faith with Blood, just stick it out until Vampire Mountain comes out."
2,Percy Jackson has stepped in to my life.,"I tried reading Darren Shan's other series,The Demonta,and I could not get through it.So I tried Cirque Du Freak and really liked it.When I read through the third book I just thought it was stupid.Though it didn't stop me from wanting to read the rest of the series.Then when I was waiting for the next book I saw that I had the book The Lightning Theif on my shelf. I decided that I would use it as reading material until I got the fourth Cirque Du Freak book.I started reading The Lightning Theif and immediatley I was hooked.I started begging for more of the series and was not able to read the fourth book of the Cirque.The more I think about it the more I realize that the Cirque is really bland and has no good writing values."
5,Perfect for small jobs,I love it. But do keep in mind it is a 3 cup processor so meant for small jobs. I use it for baby food!
1,Caution when taking off plastic wrap,"My box looked perfect condition, new, and opening it appeared the same way. As soon as I took the theCuisinart DLC-2ABC Mini-Prep Plus Food Processor, Brushed Chromeout of the plastic wrap, though, it smelled like someone sprayed me directly in the face with RAID insect spray. I advise either opening outside wearing a mask and letting it sit there all day before bringing inside or buying a different product."
4,In love with this little machine,"I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the first one I had broke within 2 months. We replaced it and have not had a problem since. My fault though, I over stuffed it. I also gave it 4 stars because it is so small. Though it's size makes it very easy to store.My husband and I use this little guy for just about everything. I have used it to make butternut squash soup, grate cheese for various dishes, chop up garlic, make cheese cake and pretty much everything/ anything I can possibly think of. I use it very rarely to make salsa and guacamole because I prefer to have those two dishes on the chunky side. I find the mini prep is too powerful for those dishes. I highly recommend this product! I would be lost without it!"
4,Love this!,"I use this everyday to make baby food. We spend a lot less buying baby food, and our son gets to eat what we are having giving him a bigger variety."
4,Perfect for Small Jobs,This is perfect for small jobs. I made some amazing pesto this week and it worked like a charm. I only gave it 4 stars because I noticed that a piece of the plastic at the bottom broke when I was trying to lock the bowl. Definitely user error but was disappointed to see it break so easily. It still works and locks into place so no worries there.
2,Motor burned out twice,"I use this instrument mainly to puree semi-frozen bananas and chop onions. It chops quite coarsely, which is minimally useful, but my biggest complaint is that the motor burned out not once, but TWICE! I'd only used it a handful - maybe 5 times total for 2 machines? - since purchasing it. The first time it burned out, I exchanged it through the 18-mo warranty, which was a bit cumbersome with being put on hold for 20 minutes, and then the FedEX returns (I work during the day, so it was difficult to schedule a pickup) and swap. However, when I received the new one, I had only used it twice before it burned out again!"
4,better for pesto than my blender,"I have a Kitchen Aid blender which has always been questionable; I nearly returned it but let the return date slip by. Anyway, it did a terrible job on pesto. My daughter had one of these given to her as a gift, and she swears by it. One of the first things I tried when mine came in was pesto, and it did work great. I followed the booklet recipe, pulse grinding first the cheese, the walnuts, the garlic, etc. Anyway, it came out great, with a much better texture. Only complaint is that thing is awfully loud, but that's true of many appliances like my big Kitchen Aid mixer. You can always do shop earmuffs or foam earplugs!"
2,Don't buy it!,"I purchased this machine and took it back. It was noisy, and jumped all over the counter when I tried to chop 4 oz of frozen strawberries - a small amount. I purchased the Kitchenaide mini chopper and it performed flawlessly at the same task - chopped the strawberries without strain, and is more solidly built and much quieter. The Kitchenaide performs so much better at all tasks that I will eventually replace my regular size Cuisinart with a Kitchenaide as well."
4,Pleased with quality for the price,"I recently ordered Cuisinart DLC-2ABC Mini Prep Plus, brushed chromeVery pleased with the prompt service and quality for the price. It is just right for my needs and easy to store as I am in an apt. with a smaller kitchen than when I was younger. One thing that you might want to improve on would be clearer instructions as to how to assemble the cover of the cup in order for it to make contact with the power. I am a widow and my husband was the one with the mechanical ability. Thankfully, I did get it figured out and am enjoying the ease of chopping and grinding. Thanks, CuisinartNorma Hovland, Bloomer, WI"
3,Wish I had gone for a larger size,"The product works very well for what it is. I can't fault it, but I can harbor some regrets that I didn't jump for a larger size processor. At the time, I figured that this would be the best size processor for someone living alone, having little counter space, and not entertaining often. However, a new program of preparing food ahead of time and attempting to freeze some batches for consumption at a later time (in other words, economizing) has suggested that a bigger processing capacity would have been a wiser choice. And the recent decision to make at least some of the pet food for my ""crew"" proved that observation, unfortunately, to be right.Not difficult to clean. This is a nice extra hand for making smaller batches of salsa, herb seasoning, dips and spreads, but if you plan to prepare big pots of soup or crocks of salad, you will probably appreciate a higher-capacity machine.P.S. It's cute!"
3,"""on"" switch has to be held down","I had the smaller ""baby cuis"" before and used it primarily for small chores and for making homemade mayonnaise. This machine does a fine job due to the same drip through top for the oil, however, it is much less convenient because the activator is a deadman switch, thus tying up one (often a little greasy) hand holding down the ""on"" switch while the other pours the oil. If there is any oil on the counter the machine will gradually move away from you, too. Wish I'd bought the older smaller model."
5,"Cuisinart DLC-2ABC Mini-Prep Plus Food Processor,",It's the perfect replacement for the one I had (previous generation). The container is slightly bigger and much more convenient.
2,very disappointed,I did alot of research before purchasing this item and I chose this one because the reviews said it chops evenly. Absolutely not true. I have tried on the chop and grind options and even putting in just 3-4 nuts some of the nuts are still practically whole while the rest of it is practically ground into flour. Very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it at all.
3,Better for chopping than grinding,"I chose this because it send it was a chopper and a grinder. I have used it for both, but the grinding is quite coarse regardless of how long you hold down the button. Also, the buttons do not lock, so you must push them down the whole time you are using it. Overall, it is okay, but I had to buy a regular grinder for my coffee beans, which I was hoping to avoid."
5,Tiny little guy,This is a very tall skinny food processor so I was concerned it wouldn't be big enough but so far so good. I bought the magenta one and it is much pinker than it looks in the picture (which I wanted) and the picture to me looks metallic but it is not.
2,"Cheapens the Cuisinart Name (but is functional). ""Chrome"" is plastic!","This product is functional so no complaints about it working, however, it is so cheap it doesn't line up with what I have come to know and expect from Cuisinart. The ""brushed chrome"" is plastic, as it the canister itself. I use it, but keep it hidden under the counter when not in use as it isn't worthy of being on display among its classy counterparts. Tsk, tsk, Cuisinart!"
2,bad purchase.,If you want to make a smoothie with this.. forget about it. The liquid splashes out from the two little holes at the top or it leaks from the side of the cover..
2,It only worked once!,"I love the Cuisinart products. However, I used this processor once to make salad dressing. I washed it and put it away and 2 weeks later, I pulled it out of the cupboard to make salad dressing again, and it didn't work! It was dead! I sent it back to Amazon (which I might add is incredibly easy) and had it replaced with another processor. Todate I have not used the 2nd processor."
5,Small but perfect!,This is a great little food processor for someone like me. I only need it for small jobs. It is NOT big and bulky. It really does a good job and is fast. I especially like the way it chops walnuts for cookies & nut roll. Love it.
3,love the color,"Beautiful color, smells like it is burning while working, hasn't burn out yet. Can't really complain as it does the job!"
5,Great wedding gift.,"We gave this to our son and new daughter in law as a wedding gift. The have the Rachel Ray cookware and this went nicely with it. This is my favorite gift to give. It can handle anything! I chop everything in it like nuts, onions, celery, tomatoes, jalapenos....and it literally takes seconds. I can have 3 different things chopped, and the chopped cleaned and put away before I can chop one onion by hand. I have had my Cuisinart mini prep chopper for 7 years and it's still working. Cuisinart is an outstanding company and stands behind their products like none other. I had had my chopper for about three years and accidentally dropped the lid and broke a piece off. It wasn't a crucial piece but it just didn't look nice. They sent me another lid. Great company and great product."
4,Cuisinart or KitchenAid,"My KitchenAid kicked the bucket so I did some online searching.The Cuisinart looks cheezier but works MUCH better.I may spray paint the cheap looking ""brushed steel"" finish if it continues to bother me."
5,so easy,"Love this little addition to my kitchen. So easy, durable, quick- I can't imagine cooking without it : Cleaning is easy, too."
1,Unexpectedly disappointing,"I was looking forward to using this mini-prep food processor to create homemade dressings, etc. & expected it to work beautifully given the Cuisinart reputation. So I was very disappointed to discover upon using it that it doesn't have an ""ON"" button which would allow you to mix a dressing for several minutes (you can really only pulse this) AND even with intermittent pulsing, the motor smelled like it was burning up after less than a minute of pressing it.In other words, it's all but useless in its ability to do anything other than a 5 sec chop (which it did fine, but I need a processor that is more versatile & can be used for multiple culinary creations). Unfortunately we had to go to the hassle of returning it & now looking for a machine that doesn't smell like the motor is going to blow up by doing what one would think a food processor could easily do."
3,Price difference,"Just a note here about price. The ""list"" price noted is $75.00, crossed off and $39.75 put in....making it seem like you are getting a real deal. Actually the price of this model on the Cuisinart website is $39 and change. Ummm..can you say FALSE ADVERTISING??"
1,Stopped working after a few months,"I am really disappointed with Cuisinart. This product was already not great to begin with, but now it has completely stopped working after maybe a dozen uses. I will not buy a Cuisinart product again."
2,only has 1 function- grind,This was advertized as having 2 functions. In essence it only has 1- grind. If you are looking for a chopper...keep looking !
1,Not worth the cleanup.,"The biggest problem with the mini prep is the ""mini"". Does doesn't hold very much. If you put too much in, it'll puree what's at the bottom and leave whole what's on top. Not good.If you regularly need to process small quantities, like about 1/2 cup, this works. But I don't find that it's worth the clean up instead of just using a knife. I rarely get mine out. I've used it occasionally to to mince onions but I usually slice them instead.For things you'd usually process in small quantities, like herbs, just get a coffee grinder. They are much cheaper and even smaller!"
4,Well made,"Its a great product, this is my second unit. Its well woth the money. Last unit lasted me good 5 years."
4,Works great,"Bought to make baby food. Works great. I put root vegtables, chicken, leafy greens, peanutbutter, frozen fruit in it and the food processor chops it up small enough for my nine month old to eat. But it does not mush is up too much so that she can get used to the different textures. This machine has saved us lots of money too, since we don't buy baby food anymore. The capacity is enough to make about two meals for her. Easy to disassemble, clean and assemble. The noise it made scared her at first, but she got used to it. I have also used the processor to make tomato sauce."
2,Weakling,"I purchased this food processor to use for a variety of tasks: chop nuts, make mayo, etc. The motor can't handle any of it. It starts to overheat after a few rounds of 10 second blending intervals. It is useless for making mayo with because the holes in the lid to pour things through while blending are incredibly small (And yes, I am only using one of the holes so air can get in, blocking the air flow isn't the issue). It takes almost 5 minutes to get 1/2 of olive oil through the hole because of its size and the fact that you have to take breaks to allow the motor to cool.I regret deciding to save money and by this inexpensive food processor. Once I have some spare cash, I am upgrading.Any suggestions?"
2,Just okay.,"I had this product for about a year and used it on occasion. I generally use a knife and cutting board. While making a small batch of pesto, the blade jumped all over and the machine starting smoking. Going for a KitchenAid now. We shall see."
1,Because its unsuitable for my country's voltage use....,Very disappointed in the fact that it is not suitable for Australian consumers. It should be stated in the ad that the voltage is 110v ..many countries use 240v. It is a lovely machine and I was certainly looking forward to using it. Had I used it with a global plug i would have blown the power/electrics in my home....Now I have a problem with returning the product. To do so would cost me twice its value. I guess it will end up in the trash. How sad. Had you said in the advertisement unsuitable for 240voltage....any thoughts on this Amazon??
2,DISAPOINTED,This does not do the job like it is supose to do. I wouldn't recomend it to any one. Tried to grind flax seed and wouldn't even touch them. Had to use my coffee grinder. Very disapointed. So it just sits on my counter and looks pretty.
2,lid breaks too easily,"Bought originally for homemade baby food. Works well enough on softer stuff. It only sees light duty but we have gone through two broken lids - the locking piece breaks off. Can get replacements, but IMHO they are a bit pricey for what they are. Not a sturdy design."
5,The best food processor for the best price!,"I am a foodtv fan and almost every great recipe needs a food processor, but I wanted something small that would take up little counter space, so I was happy to find this small Cuisinart mini prep and purchased it for less than $35.00 on Amazon. I absolutely love it! I have made a garlic bread with herbs that everyone loved at my table. Along with salad dressings and so many more great recipes. The clean up is easy and is lightweight."
3,good mixer,it is so perfect and it easy to use. I like it very much.it also to carry out when we have a trip. five stars
3,Like it but way too loud without ear plugs!,"Used this today and checked the decibels. It hit 90 db chopping peanuts. It is a great little machine for chopping small jobs, but the noise makes it dangerous for ones ears. Wear ear plugs!"
2,"Works well, but do NOT put in dishwasher!!!!!","The product says that it is dishwasher safe, but after one trip through our dishwasher we are going to have to buy a new work bowl and lid...."
1,Defective,"This item was shipped on February 6, 2012. We purchased it brand new. We used it approx. four times and on Mar. 22, it quit working and would not turn on. It is defective and we cannot return it since it is past the 30 days return policy. Obviously we are not happy about this."
1,cheap plastic,"I have owned a full sized Cuisinart for years and it has worked flawlessly. I had an inexpensive mini-processor that I used for 12 years before the motor gave out. The Cuisinart mini-prep looked like the perfect replacement. This replacement was broken within a week.First, the brushed chrome is not actually chrome; it is plastic and it is the cheapest feeling plastic you can imagine.Second, the bowl and cover were difficult to slide into place.While the mechanism worked well, the clips on the lid snapped off on the third use of this machine even though the cover locked in place. It felt cheap and flimsy and it was. It is going back. It was a major disappointment."
1,A waste of money,"I bought a Cuisinart DLC-2ABC Mini Prep Plus Food Processsor at Amazon.com. Used it one time and the motor just stopped. Let it rest and tried it again...I am a Cancer Patient and my helper was trying to puree some cooked dried fruits for me. She came back the next time and it was still not working. If I had saved the box I would have returned it, but one can't keep all boxes in a 1 room apt, in a nursing home. Renee [...]"
5,Great little side-kick to my larger food processor,"I love the size of this. There are times when I need to do a small job, like chopping fresh herbs or garlic, and this is just right for that. Saves me the time of having to hand chop!"
2,cute and easy,This is a very cute machine and works very well but seems to me to produce the same results as the smaller Cuisinart which uses the wand to activate the chopping function. It does not hold more food than the base of the wand chopper and chops very finely....in fact pulverizes vegetables unless one is very careful to quickly press and release the chop button.
5,Powerful Little Food Processor,"This food processor is perfect for my tiny kitchen. It takes up very little space but is perfect for making salsa and sauces. Very easy to clean, and almost everything you can pop in the dish washer. Perfect!"
4,Love it!,I used this for the first time to make salsa and vinegrette on father's day and I have to say that I am extremely satisfied with it. It was quite simple to use and definitely chopped up my salsa ingredients as well as helping me create my first ever vinegrette. Those hold on top for pouring liquids in was great. I even squeezed lemon juice for the vinegrette on this top section so the seeds and pulp don't come thru. I would highly recommend. Wish the cord was longer though and there was an extra bowl so that shifting between dishes was easier.
4,Small but great,"I have used this little thing for a while now and I am very happy with it other than it's size. I usually only cook for myself, but I still find myself wanting a larger capacity processor.It works great and I use it to chop up my tomatoes, onions and green peppers and other foods for cooking. Never a problem with the product, only the issue with how small it is.So, if you don't mind the small capacity, then I would highly recommend this little food processor. I'm planning on upgrading to a larger one eventually, but until then, I'm very happy with this Cuisinart food processor."
5,This is the mainstay food processor for most needs!,"What a relief to have a compact Cuisinart that does almost EVERYTHING we need from a food processor. We have the massive unit, with all the various attachments and options, and frankly, it took up way too much space on the counter and way too much space in the storage for all the accessories!). Also, my husband cut his thumb pretty deeply on one of the blade unit accessories from the monster-sized Cuisinart, so we finally just put it on the shelf in the garage. Low-and-Behold, we found this little 'chopper' unit and really love it. Except for grating cheese (which is doesn't do), it handles everything else that we ever needed from the big monster Cuisinart... at a fraction of the cost and a fraction of the shelf space!"
4,Does the job nicely!,"I bought this food processor for small jobs that require some muscle: homemade pesto and hummus. Does the job beautifully. Super easy clean up, the 3 components (blade, bowl & lid) just pop right into the dishwasher."
5,Awesome for baby food,"I purchased this based on the suggestion of the Wholesome baby food recipe website. I wasn't sure what to expect and was surprised at how small it was. It has been an absolute dream for making all kinds of baby foods. It puree's everything nicely, it isn't so loud that my baby gets scared when using it, and it's super easy to clean. I haven't used it on anything heavy duty yet, like nuts, so I can't speak to that. I've only been using it a week, but I love it so far.Sept 17, 2010I have had this for over a year and still love it. It still works great and I've used it for all kinds of things."
1,It Attempted Suicide,"A little mayo, some toasted pecans, and 1/2"" chunks of cheddar. That's all it took to depress this underwhelming appliance. It began groaning - it shook - it then emitted the unmistakable reek of burning electronics.The cheese was at room temperature and the container less than 1/2 full. This should not have been challenging, should it?Cuisinart has built some commendable products; but, really, in recent years they've been too willing to put their name on just about anything."
3,"Works well, but returning.","This food processor has been very easy to use. The blade shape helps the food not to turn to mush while chopping. I am disappointed because I will be returning it. When using to puree or finely chop, it gives off a smell like the motor is overheating. I don't want to take the chance that it will burn up after the warranty is up, so I am returning it. Otherwise, I really liked it. Of course, I can't say if all of them are this way or if I just got a lemon. That is why I always try to buy expensive items from a place where I have ""no hassle returns""."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this machine in order to make my baby's food and it worked fine for that task. But when I started chopping nuts and hard cheeses, it just couldn't do it. The blade broke and I just realized that it costs about $20 -s+h included- to replace it. It's just not worth it."
4,only one drawback,"Great product except that I wish it could be used for smaller amounts of stuff. For example, if I chop up a little garlic, it seems like it all jumps to the outer edges before it gets chopped enough so I add a red pepper to the garlic just so it will work better. I still have to use a spatula to scrape the sides about 3 or 4 times which is not very energy efficient (turning a motor off and on several times is not energy efficient). I don't have any other brands to compare it to, but everything seems to work well. I mostly use it to puree veggies, cooked and raw. I think if you wanted more of a diced product, it would be more of a challenge."
5,Just what I needed,"I love it. Just the right size to sit on the counter. It did all the chopping for my Thanksgiving stuffing with minimum cleanup. Also great for little jobs, such as making fresh bread crumbs. I have a large food processor but found I would often do the job by hand rather than have to haul it out."
2,wouldn't buy again,"its size is nice but its cheaply made, things are breaking off mine and ive had it for a short time and dont use it often."
1,Don't waste your money,This thing is a piece of junk! We used it maybe three times and then the center hub of the plastic container just snapped off for no reason what so ever. I had rinsed it out and was wiping it dry with a paper towel when I noticed that it had broken away from the base. This is the second Cuisenart item in the past year that I have purchased and been unhappy with.. I am done with this company; they can keep their junk.
1,"No chopping here, only puree",I recently received this as a gift & am sorely disappointed. This does not chop but very finely minces and purees vegetables. The vegetables on the bottom get pureed and the ones on top do not even get cut. What a waste of money. I'm back to basics with my cutting board & knife.
2,Waste of Money,I got this for $20 at a different store and even wish I hadn't spent that much. It will consistently leak liquids if filled 3/4's full and holds almost nothing. Save the money and buy a quality product.
1,Damaged,"When Received it, the package was badly damaged in shipping. Bought as a gift and had to buy another one because I could not give it in the state it was in. Returned the product two weeks ago. Giving a little extra time for a refund due to the holidays but will not accept any longer. They were very nice about returning the product. It's the refund part that I'm starting to wonder about. It would be easier just to go to a store and buy it."
1,Cuisinart DLC-2AM Mini-Prep Plus Processor,"I purchased 1 of Cuisinart DLC-2AM Mini-Prep Plus Processor, Magenta via amazon last month.It has been a disappointment. From day one it has been almost impossible to get the cover on and off.Now today the cover seems to be permanently stuck.Please replace this cover or refund my money.If not, I will blog about this on my international business/finance blogs."
1,Piece of Junk-what a ripoff,I bought this product in March and it never worked at all. What a big waste of money!
1,No power on first time use,"Bought one of these about 3 years ago and kind of forgot about it. I got it out today after clearing out some room in my kitchen and thought I'd give it a test run. No power to the processor at all even though it has never been used and was in great condition otherwise. Really sad I can't try it now but c'est la vie, outside of any return or warranty range."
5,That is what I need,"I've looked around for months to find something that well grinds cooked vegetables and meat to make baby food. It should have been a compact, sharp one and easy to clean and care. There is no doubt that Cuisinart is one of top brand names in kitchenware, just only find right things to meet your need. It is really a great one. I also bought Cuisinart 7-cup food processor. It is doing great, too."
5,Feisty little machine,"This is a great mini chopper for prep work or light duty chopping. Yes, the blade is sharp. But it is not meant for any heavy duty chopping. I use mine for nuts, cinnamon sticks, herbs, softer vegetables, onions & garlic, etc. I would not recommend uncooked potatoes.. that's what full size food processors are for. I've even made small batches of salsa and hummus.It is a useful small kitchen appliance, and it is easy to store and clean."
5,Great for small jobs and easy to clean,"After reading the numerous glowing reviews a couple of months ago, I bought this mini-processor. It's great for small jobs, such as making salad dressings, chopping small amounts of herbs and/or onions, grinding flax seeds, pureeing a few vegetables, and making smoothies. The noise and vibration of the processor when grinding frozen fruits gives me the impression that the motor is not powerful enough to handle hard objects and/or will break if used for more than a few seconds at a time. However, up to now the mini-processor has been working just fine. It's easy to clean and store. It cannot replace my trust-worthy 1981 large Cuisinart, but I'm glad I have, and definitely recommend, this Mini Prep Plus food processor."
1,Not what I was looking for,"Trying to replace a Black & Decker Short Cut food processor that got dropped. This seemed like the closest thing to it, but upon receipt I found it seemingly lacking one of the Short Cut's capabilities that I used frequently, namely shredding. Also the ""brushed chrome"" description is something of a euphemism. I am not currently using this product."
5,Cuisinart Mini Prep,"I've just bought my second Mini Prep machine. Decided that I need one to leave in the RV. I forgot to take it on our last trip and really missed it.It doesn't replace my full sized Food Processor, but I find that I use it every day. A very handy little machine. Great for chopping veggies, herbs, making salad dressings and compound butters. I never buy bread crumbs because I can make my own in seconds. It makes lovely salsa and guacamole. I've noticed that some people complain that it jumps around a bit. Well, it will because it's pretty powerful, but in the instructions it suggests you keep one hand on it while it's running. Not too much of a hardship in my opinion.All in all, it's well worth the money and a great time saver."
4,"Great for baby food, purees",I was mainly looking for a way to make baby food and this is great! I just take whatever we are eating and throw it in and it makes a very smooth puree. I was concerned but the 2 settings are chop and grind so I didnt know if it would do a smooth enough puree but it is as smooth as silk. I have not yet tried to chop an onion or anything else yet but for those looking for baby food this is great and the perfect size. Not to big and not to small.
2,"Not very good for lemongrass, and doesn't stay lock","This Cuisinart DLC-2 doesn't grind fine. For Khmer cooking purpose, I need the sliced lemongrass to be very fine. After chopping and grinding for at least 5 minutes, they were slightly coarse. The bowl doesn't stay lock either, and keeps moving on each pulse. I bought it new at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $24 plus tax."
1,Short Lived,"We are normally fans of Cuisinart, but this Mini Prep quit working after three months of use primarily chopping onions and garlic. It worked well while it lasted. The rotor is frozen in place. A real disappointment from a company that has traditonally provided quality equipment."
4,Works great - looks cheap,"I had the identical Cuisinart in white for many years until I broke the plastic lock-in piece off the lid. Bought the ""brushed chrome"" thinking it would look more up-to-date. NOT! It is cheap looking plastic. HOWEVER it works fabulous (5 stars), just like my old one. I would buy it again but would get it in white - much nicer."
4,Great Product,"I've recently purchased this item and used it once. It was great making salsa and a lot smaller and easier to clean than a full-size food processor. Also, takes up a lot less room in the cabinet."
4,"Good, practical addition to my kitchen","This is a very handy addition is you're doing a good amount of chopping. Just toss in your rough-chopped ingredients all together and give it a whir. Best of all, it's only three pieces and cleans up nicely in the dishwasher - - though most of the time it just takes a quick rinse and it's ready for action."
5,Love It,"Great product for the $. Nice asthetics, functions well and is as represented in the listing. Would recommend over competing brands."
5,Great size!,Perfect to prepare baby food. And to process anything else. Small enough so you dont have a huge appliance on top of your kitchen counter.
1,Very Poor Quality Product,"I recieved the Mini-Prep Plus as a birthday gift several months ago. Initially, I was quite pleased with it as it was just the right size for the small quantities of food I needed to chop up. Then it died on me...after only about seven or eight uses. All I used it for was chopping vegetables like carrots, onions, and bell peppers. I couldn't believe it. When I called Cuisinart customer service the best they could do to help me was try to sell me another one for half price. Why would I invest money in a product that has already proved to be a piece of junk? How many times would it work before it burned out? Don't waste your money on this product...look for a different brand with a better reputation and a company that will stand behind their products."
2,Brushed Chrome,"Don't fall for the ""brushed chrome"" nonsense. It is cheap plastic painted a slver color. I am very disappointed."
4,"Does the Job, A little Big","I like this mini-chopper so far after about two weeks of use. I replaced a smaller chopper that is about 1/3 of the capacity thinking I would like the extra room. It's not that I don't, it's just that this model is a little too large for my liking in terms of storage in a cabinet -- it works, but I have to separate the top from the bottom to do it. In terms of functionality, I'm very satisfied. I'm not sure I understand the difference between the chop and grind buttons, but in practice I like how it works because one spins the blade one way and one spins it the other way. That obviously has a practical impact on how the blades affect what they are processing too. On the whole, I think this is a good product that I would recommend. They only reason it's not 5 stars is more personal preference. I might look for a two cup capacity (this one is 3 cup) if I were doing it over."
4,I would recommend this!,"I love it! I The only thing was it had no feed shute, but it was surpriisingly powerful and versatile. I even use it to make dough!"
5,Great,Looks great! Came fast! Packaged perfectly. My mom loves it for small tasks instead of using her large one indtead
4,excellent,"I'm so glad I purchased this after reading multiple reviews. Amazingly fast, easy to use and clean. It does chop fine, so using the pulse is important."
3,Loud Chopper,This machine is an efficient but extremely LOUD Chopper. I mean this sucker is loud. I am not sure why Cuisinart decided not to muffle the sound a little bit considering that it's big brothers are extremely quiet. Anyhow it gets the job done. Chopping is as easy as 2 or 3 push of the pulse button and you're done. Anything more than this and you will get a smoothie instead.
2,Nice But Broke Quickly After Warranty Period,"Worked decently within the limitations I expected from a mini processor. I found this a useful tool for some tasks which normally require a blender or full sized processor.However, soon after the warrantly period expired I burned out the engine doing some very basic processing work. I was surprised how easy it is to completely ruin the product via any extended period of light usage.I recommend avoiding this processor and other Cuisinart processors made in China."
2,good processor but did not last long,"works great but after a year and half of use ( once a week), it just stopped working. I am not happy and I'm not going to buy similar item again, I'll try another brand."
1,Cute But Leaks- I don't recommend it,"At first I wrote a good review about this product, but sadly I had to delete it.The first time I used it it was fine, but the second time was not so great. It started to leak all over, from the bottom, and the top. I checked to make sure everything was in place, and it was. So this processor is not dependable, at least the one I got.I am returning it-Also, I didn't realize how small it is.It is only good for small things, such as sauces. If you want to make anything else get a bigger one."
1,Don't buy this...get the Kitchenaid KFC3100 instead!!,"I had this Cuisinart DLC Miniprep first, and was not happy with it. I wanted a small food processor primarily to chop up an onion and some garlic cloves, and with the Cuisinart, I pretty much ended up doing almost all of the chopping before I put the food in the processor, otherwise large sections wouldn't get cut.After reading the reviews here about how the Kitchenaid has the reverse sprial action which pulls down the food, I thought I'd try that one, and it's true!! The Kitchenaid KFC3100 is a superior product! Now I can just cut the onion into quarters and throw in whole garlic cloves and it cuts them all up perfectly. If your not sure which of the two products to buy, get the Kitchenaid KFC3100!"
3,Mini Processor,"Thinking Cuisinart produces a quality product, I purchased the Mini Prep Plus Food Processor. Firstly, I ordered the chrome finish and received the white. Knowing it wouldn't sit out on my counter, I decided to keep the white, rather than return it. In the winter I make a lot of soups. Thinking this chopper would be great for chopping celery, onions and carrots,I was excited not to have all that chopping to do. The chopper doesn't chop - it shreds the vegetables. They are too small for soup or salad. The chopper is great for making quacamole. But that is about it. The bowl capacity is WAY to small to chop more than a stalk of celery at a time. I'm not really even sure what else to use this little chopper for. Wouldn't recommend it. Unless it's for guacamole or baby food, buy a bigger chopper."
2,Not impressed.,"I use this about twice a month to grind homecooked dog food. I don't think I'm too rough on it - I chop the meat into small chunks and never overfill it. I frequently encounter two problems:1) It smells like hot electrical components. I never keep it continuously running - I pulse on/off until the food is sufficiently chopped. Nonetheless, it smells like I've overworked it. It hasn't stopped working yet, but it sure smells like it will give out any day now!2) Somehow, food gets up under the blade insert (I think this occurs when it shakes in the beginning like an unbalanced washing machine), and it is nearly impossible to clean it out of the long cylindrical piece of plastic. It seems like a bad design. I soak in hot soapy water and vinegar, but I can still see that there is a coating of dried food in there.When this one breaks, I'll shop for a different brand."
5,Best little chopper. Must have for any kitchen!,Love this chopper. Had one gave it to my mom because I moved in with my boyfriend who had an Oster version. The Oster couldn't keep up so I bought myself a new one and the Oster was donated to charity! Great when doing small items so I don't have to pull out my full size food processor. A msut for any kitchen!
5,Nice,If you like fast easy and clean cook if you like garlic onion and you don't like cut this using knife this machines is perfect for you. Work grate.
1,Makes mush,Tried carefully pulsing and still end up with mush as well as some large uncut pieces. Wouldn't recommend it unless you need a musher!
1,Terrible product,"I bought this mini food processor with the intention of doing easy things, like smoothies and sauces. It is very small and the motor starts to smell like burning after about 10 seconds.It does a very poor job pureeing anything. That is with simple, easy to break down ingredients. I was very unhappy with this product and will now have to buy a new one. Don't waste your money."
1,A hunk of junk!,I bought one of these and the first time I tried using it I had to push the button down so many times that it started to smell like burning electrical. It didn't chop the food either. What a waste of money and counter space. This hunk of junk is going back!
5,Best Small Space Appliance!,"This is my second most used and most beloved kitchen appliance (after my Kitchenaid Stand Mixer). When you live in a small space, it is critical to buy high quality products that are versatile and don't take up room on your counters or in cabinets. This little mixer has exceeded all my expectations in quality, power, durability, and smallness. I use it 2-4 times per week and it has performed like a champ. I regularly use it to make smoothies; hence, I have no need for a large bulky blender."
4,Powerful enough for most uses,"I use this all the time--works great, cleans easily, doesn't overheat. I use it for chopping everything, and especially onions (don't like to cry!)Cool tip that isn't the first thing to come to mind for a food processor: you can make fresh flatbreads in just a few minutes (e.g. Indian naan bread). Just toss the ingredients in it and pulse, the dough comes together quickly. Let it rest/rise as you see fit or as per recipe and then roll it into balls, flatten, and fry it on a non-stick pan."
4,"For the price, does what I need it to do.","We've had one of these for over a year and got this as a secondary for another location. We have a larger unit for main processing, but this one gets used every few days with the two of us. Had some initial manufacturing oil smell the first few uses until it burned off the motors coils. I usually rinse off the lid, cup and knife and throw them in the top shelf of the dishwasher and never had an issue. With the unit that is over a year old there is some rust forming on the drive shaft, most likely because the knife is put back on while the drive hole still has water in it. I deal with the issue, but I probably could have prevented it from occurring if we made it a habit to keep the knife loose, or if the company made the shaft out of stainless."
3,A fragile beauty,"Perfectly pretty for my turquoise kitchen! The processor works well for small batches of chopping, and cleans up easily. The plastic tab on the lid broke off the first time I used it so everyone be gentle with this item! It works without the tab and sending it back isn't cost effective. I would prefer a large processor but have no space for one."
4,Great for the price,"This food processor works very well, almost too well for its size. It is extremely easy to clean-up, however because of its small capacity, you have to be careful not to overfill it with anything slightly liquid or it will leak out the top. I wish the lid would seal better, but this seems to be a problem with any food processor. It is also plenty powerful, but you have to be careful not to over do it. I make a lot of homemade salsa, and I had to learn quickly just to ""blip"" it a few times otherwise I would end up with salsa soup.Overall, you can't beat it for the price. I don't use a food processor for very many things, so having a cheap small one that works well and doesn't take up much space is perfect for me."
5,Excellent mini food processor,"This mini food processor is great if you don't have a lot of room in your kitchen. Ours has been going strong for 3 years and we use it constantly to grind hard cheese. It is easy to clean, it works great, although sometimes it requires that you press the chop or grind button to get at a piece that doesn't get cut."
2,Pesto - burned up !,"Made pesto last evening with parsley, walnuts, two cloves of garlic, and extra virgin olive oil. Added ingredients, a small amount at a time.The machine started to smell like it was burning up and eventually quit running."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"I bought this to replace my ""Little Oscar"" which, sadly, is no longer available. I was sure that Cuisinart would make an excellent product. I was SO wrong! Upon opening, I was disappointed with the thin, shoddy plastic that was used to make this machine. Even the ""brushed chrome"" finish, is plastic--no chrome there!!! Then I tried making tuna salad, the thing I make most frequently in the little machine. It was a disaster. The tuna didn't break up, the mayo didn't mix in, and I had to empty and reload it 2-3 times to get an adequate salad mix. Then I tried chopping ONE onion. I had to pick out the big chunks and empty the small chunks at least 3 times before my onion was chopped. I supposed I could return it, but packing and shipping is expensive and bothersome, and what else would I get? This review requires me to give a star-rating. This product deserves NO STARS, but that is not an option."
1,Piece of garbage,Piece of garbage. Super annoying to reassemble after washing. Can't get the thing to seat onto the base easily. Seems to cut stuff to smithereens in like 2 seconds. Which makes it hard to make a decent pico using the thing.Probably deserves 2 stars but I'm giving it 1 to balance out all the overly positive reviews.
2,HP Print Head,First print head that was ordered did not arrive only a empty box. The lady was nice on the phone and rushed out a replacement. Upon arrival and installation it was recognized that it was an old printhead via the date and not in very good working order. It failed within a couple of weeks. These events made my life very difficult since I work at home and print heads are usually only available online - I have found no stores that carry them. Call Amazon again and as expected were a bit suspect of the third call but with some convincing the third printhead was sent. While it was a hassle with the print heads Amazon came through and for that I am appreciative. Second print head sent back to Amazon this last week.Ron Huddleston
3,One Way to Fix Print Heads ... sometimes,"FYI -I am finally going to have to order a new printhead but want users of HP88 printheads to know that you can sometimes extend their lives (in my case mine lasted 2.5 more years and I print a lot) by soaking the head -- the metal tips part, in nail polish remover for 5-10 minutes, then kleenex drying the submersed part, resinserting into the printer...and running a test. Worked for me multiple times. This time I soaked the cyan/magenta one twice ... and it's still not working so may finally have to replace.But thought I'd send this tidbit of advice along."
1,One bad egg!,"This printhead worked less than sixteen weeks! The last one I bought from a local retailer lasted over three years. The seller has a strict 30 day return policy and told me to contact HP. HP said to contact the retailer..... I'm out $60 with no apparent recourse on the ""warranty."" I will not work with this retailer again!"
1,Problems Repeatedly,"I bought 2 of the same All-In-One printers from HP. They BOTH stink. They both have the same frequent printhead problems on both the black/yellow and the cyan/magenta printheads.You can fix the problem for a while but it keeps coming back, more and more frequently. DON'T SPEND ANOTHER DIME on this piece of dung!"
1,Not for the L7680,"I have an Officejet L7680 all-in-one printer. The proper ink for this printer is ""Officejet 88."" I have never had a problem buying ink for this device until a recent order.I purchased an HP 88 Black/Yellow Officejet Printhead in Retail Packaging. Right on the packaging, it states that the product is for the L7680. When I opened up the package, it was obvious that the product would not fit my printer. The only difference I can see is that in the past I have purchased ""HP Ink Cartridge"" in the 88 series. What I received is an ""HP Printhead"" in the 88 series. Why would HP use the same numbering series to describe two different products? And why would it be label to lead one to believe it can be used with the L7680?Amazon, as usual, refunded the money for the return."
2,Print Heads Don't Replace,Purchased new print heads since HP print out stated that they were worn out.Put in the new ones and they worked for one day. Then got constant error message.Could never get them to work after then so went out and purchased aEPSON printer and traded in the old HP for $75 trade in bucks.
1,Didn't Last 8 months!,"I purchased this item in November of 2009. I just received an error message telling me the printerhead is now bad, it's July 2010. Now I have to spend another large amount of money to get my printer working again."
1,Failed after printing the test pages,"I installed the printhead and the printer did its diagnostics and after a few minutes it printed two test pages perfectly. I was so proud of this that I shut off the printer and ate dinner.When I came back, I turned on the printer and it told me that I had to replace the printhead. I figured I got a dud and since the HP Warranty (on the printhead) was still over a year away I called HP.They said it had to be my printer since my printer was old. I argued with them that I think I received a faulty printhead. They said they WILL NOT HONOR the warranty for the printhead since the printer is out of warranty?!?!?When I told them how much the printhead cost, they almost gasped and told me that I could get a new printer for the same price.I think I need to buy a Canon or Epson now..."
3,Pinthead worked.,"I have mixed feeling about this. The printhead solved my printing problems--gaps on the printed page--but it's only replacing a part that failed a little more than a year after being put into light service--just enough for the warranty to expire! I called HP customer service and they charged me $39 to tell me I have to buy a new printhead from them for $72. I found this one at Amazon for almost half the price (both are genuine HP parts). I did get my $39 refunded from HP but only after an hour long hassle that turned my opinion of HP from very positive to, well, they're just another computer company. Reality bites."
1,piece of junk lasted 41 days,This is the second time the black/yellow printhead has failed for me on the HP L7680 All-in-one printer. This time it lasted only 41 days -- home use with low # of copies printed. This particular printer is a clunky piece of junk and I won't buy HP again.
4,Try the shake and clean before replacing,"My L7580 started saying both my printheads had an error. I took them out and wiped both heads at least two or three times and rebooted the printer twice. Then it started saying the M/C one had an error. I took it out and shook it like a bottle of nail polish (needless to say some spilt on my flooring and my wife is pissed) and wiped the head with a napkin and methylated spirit. Stuck it back in and works! My printer is about two years old, but has not done much printing. So before you replace the heads if you get similar errors - do the shake and wipe first."
3,Solved a problem that shouldn't have occured in the first place,"This printhead solved the problem of idling my expensive HP printer after just over a year of light duty use.Searching the internet I found hundreds of similar accounts of this same part failing early.No one else makes this printhead, other than HP and it costs about 30% of the cost of the printer.I don't like being held hostage by HP given a choice to replace an expensive part or throw away an even more expensive printer.So I decided to replace all my company's HP printers, with Canon."
4,HP 88 Magenta/Cyan Officejet Printhead,Product recieved on time and corrected the error message I was recieving on my HP officejet Pro K5400. Came in sealed factory box.
1,Marginal Print Head,"My print head has failed twice since I bought this printer in 2009. This is a much too common failure.The most recent time, I checked the warranty date on the side of the print head and found it was still in warranty and decided to get it replaced. However, if you wish to do this you will need to suffer through the very poor HP customer service. It takes forever on the phone. In addition, it will take weeks to get the new part. I finally decided to buy one and also get a warranty replacement so that I have a spare.The tech from HP said that there is a super secret printer reset for the HP L7780 that will fix the print head. So if yours fails, call HP and see if they can get yours to work or get a warranty replacement instead of spending more than $50 on a new one."
1,faulty product,I was pleased to find refurbished products but mine did not work I had to get a new one. This product wasn't worth sending back since it would have cost me as much as i paid for the product in shipping both ways after returning it.
5,Manufacturer's product,"Product is as ordered. While the manufacturer has grossly overpriced their cartridges, Amazon offers the best price I could find. Shipping from Amazon was slow. It took 13 days to arrive which is contrary to every other order I've placed. Amazon has, other than this one shipment, offered the best prices and has had excellent shipping. I will continue to order from them"
5,The exact product,This is the exact product for theHP Officejet Pro L7580 Color All-in-One Printer/Fax/Scanner/Copier(C8187A#ABA).I love no longer having to look at a wall of mis-numbered printer cartridges.Amazon's price is consistently the best.
5,HP 88 printhead,"The printhead was shipped promptly, was in original packaging, installed easily,and is working perfectly. A good experience all around. I highly recommend the company and the product"
2,Forced to purchase this item.,"There is absolutely NO reason for a printer to have an additional print cartridge like this, a 'print head' ink cartridge. The H.P. printer already has ink cartridges, which by them selves, are already too expensive. Now when you add this additional ink cartridge, which is WAY over priced, then that is double gouging. This is the second printhead I have had to purchase in the last 6 months. Shame on you H.P.! The 7600 AIO printer works great, just 'eats' these expensive printhead cartridges for dinner."
3,A defective printhead that works,"I have been trying to get HP to provide warranty on two (2) C9381A print heads (Black/Yellow) one printing only black, originally a warranty replacement, and another which does not work at all after about one month which was purchased from Amazon two months ago. HP says that because my C9382A printhead is old (even though it works) it may be affecting the performance of the C9381A print heads. So now I have to buy a new C9382A print head and install it, run the diagnostics again and then get back to them with the results. No where have I read that the printheads have a limited life. I think this is HP smoke and mirrors, however all of you HP users out there be aware, and be ready for a real run around."
4,Works great,"Our All-in-one printer was not printing black so we bought a new black ink cartridge. That didn't solve the problem, so we researched & decided that we needed a new printhead. Ordered through Amazon due to their pricing. The product came in on time & in new condition. I pulled out the old printhead & put in the new one. The printer automatically aligned & adjusted the new printhead. The print quality is like brand new. The new printhead made a huge difference. The printheads come with a expiration date which is also the warranty date. If it fails to perform within that date, HP will replace it for free. I wish I new that before my original expired. I could give the product a 5 star rating for the way it performs, but the price in comparison to the overall price of the printer is ridiculous."
2,Linden was robbed,"Kathy Linden will always be remembered thanks to ""Billy."" The 1958 hit shows up on compilations all the time, and it's a great example of the music of the time. This CD has 34 tracks, including her 4 top 100 hits (Billy, Goodbye Jimmy Goodbye, You Don't Know Girls and You'd Be Surprised.) Happily it also includes two ""B"" sides that should have been hits on their own (if Felsted Records had known what they were doing): Heartaches At Sweet Sixteen, and If I Could Hold You In My Arms. As to the other 28 tracks: yikes! What a waste. Linden had a pleasant voice and pleasing presentation. She just needed a team of writers from the Brill Building to give her material worthy of her. The majority of the songs on this CD are saccharine and undistinguished (and undistinguishable from each other.) A good buy to get the six tunes mentioned if you don't already have them. Otherwise, not that great."
4,Sweet story,"This is a story (well, not much in the way of a plot...) about the author's mother and grandmother, and how through their differences they were, in many ways, the same.There's not much of a story there, but still, I liked the book quite a bit."
4,A Really great Cildren's Book,"When I read this book to my 6 year old granddaughter, she didn't quite get the final description of the relationships but it came to her very quickly. The character description is wonderful amd the moral of the tale beautifully portrayed. Eve can read this on her own but loves having it read to her (with all the voices acted.) I never tire of reading it."
2,What a pain!,"It's not the product that's bad but the hassel of putting it on the phone! I didn't know that the entire original faceplate must be removed before this can be put on. You have to use a special screwdriver (a General Cell Phone Screwdriver T6 no.666) to install the housing, and no where in the product description does it mention that. Plus, the screwdriver should be INCLUDED in the purchase for what it costs! It's hard to find. I had to special order it!"
4,Excellent Historical Novel,"I found this to be a highly engaging historical novel. The characters are well-developed and consistent. The historical references and period military tactics were obviously researched in detail, are described clearly and succinctly, and tie in nicely with the story. There are no loose ends. It illustrates the latter part of the American Revolution from multiple perspectives. It's also a gripping tale of a boy becoming a man under exceptional circumstances. A great read."
2,First and last book of this kind,"If your an open mind trying to find a world view that makes sence you might get trapt into such paradoxes as this. Please be careful tho because to ponder and live by thinking this a reality will only let you be perceptable to other ignorances of the sort.I can't say the material in this book is titly nitted to have everything make sence If your looking for reasurance of quantities beyond the material search your Bible from a point of view that is not of the culture but in a literal sence. There are ways of being sure there, as is the human condition is fully paralell to what most would agree on. Hope you find what your looking for or perhaps who seeks you."
5,Outstanding Book !,"While reading this book, i felt more understanding than i did years ago, always questioning, always waning to learn more information. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind, and to anyone who likes anything alien related A+ ^^)I hope to read more books from Dolores soon..."
3,Yes and No,"The book succeeds in helping people to understand that extraterrestrials actually exist and that abductions and contacts are taking place.It fails in discerning the truth about what these ETs are saying. You would not believe every thing that any unfamiliar human being would say to you. So why would you believe every thing that an extraterrestrial, guardian, or spirit would say to you?! (sigh)"
2,Too much self promotion,This book may have been more enjoyable if it were not for all the self promotion the author does for her other books. It seems about almost every 5th page she gives one of her other books a plug. Sometimes its done when there isn't even anything related to what she's currently talking about. Otherwise there are some really good interviews that have really interesting experiences to share - but then the author also likes to put her own comments (pages of them) inserted into the interviews and basically puts her own spin on things. Both of these tendencies are very distracting - not too mention the self promotion is just plain IRRITATING.
4,Kinda creepy,"thought I would order this book and check out what it is all about. I have thumbed through and is a bit scary. Going to sit down and read it in depth. I like books that are controversial, and interesting. Received very quickly and in brand new condition. love amazon prime, really decent price plus quick delivery, what more can you ask for ?"
5,Amazing information,This book contains non-stop information about the beings who are marshaled around Earth to help us move through our time of negativity into a new dimension. Focused on the volunteers who have taken on earth lives in order to help. Absolutely mind expanding if one has an expandable mind. Recommended for all who want to understand what is happening at this time in earth's history.
3,Probably you can find better books about UFO-s,"While reading I found myself skipping section after section, and the reason is that the questions posed during the sessions are simply uninteresting and repeatitive. They mostly concentrate on how the aliens look like, general smalltalk and overly repeating the patient safty concerns, these could have been just left out of the book.On the positive side however, occasionally some interesting material also surfaces. And I also like the structure of the book content - small introductions to each case followed by the actual conversation during the hypnotic session. As I mentioned above it would be better if the conversations were not given at full length but only better parts of them were presented."
5,Continuity of messages,"I was drawn to Delores' work through similarities of the messages between her work, and the very first book I read, ""The Andreasson Affair"", by Ray Fowler. His book was published in the early 80's, (or late 70's!!), but the messages all seem to be saying the same thing. We have gone from 'nuts & bolts' study of the UFO issue, to what seems to be the true underlying purpose: Spiritual Growth. I am sure that many did not expect this to be the end result of years of scientific research, but overall, that seems to be the pieces of the emerging puzzle. I devoured the book in two days, and am looking forward to her coming revelations in ""The Convoluted Universe""."
3,"Was excellent, now mired and out of ideas...","Well ya just had to go down the breast cancer route. The writer's who thought this story line would be compelling, for lack of any original ideas, should be replaced. Not only has this been done dozens of times, but it has been done better. I smell and see a dearth of story lines here and probably the end of a pretty good show - for NBC.Definitely worth watching the first three seasons but then if you are smart, you will let it go and move on to another show. Season four blows. Unbelievably melodramatic and preachy."
5,I love it!,"Love, addicted to the show! I identify on so many levels, excellent writing, awesome acting...I forget I'm watching a show."
4,Surprised...,"I know this is titled ""Parenthood"", and I was concerned that when I first started watching it that I would never relate and forget about it. I do not have children of my own, nor am I married. I do feel that this show does a great job of creating likeable characters and real family issues, and it gives you a great perspective from all sides, from the children, to parents, to grandparents. I would highly recommend this show to anyone, for I feel that it is well written, fairly true to life, and gives you a sense of what true family is all about. I am never disappointed by this show, and I believe it is worth one giving it a chance, regardless of life status."
5,Life's lessons,I loved every episode of Parenthood. I literally could not stop watching until I had watched every single one. I laughed until my stomach hurt. And on some I cried it was so real. I hope there are more seasons to come.
5,Season 3,Love this series! I cannot rave enough about it! This particular episode was great. I love how no matter how many seasons you watch the continue with everyday issues and REAL family life. They somehow still find ways to keep it funny at the same time. Great show!
2,Parenthood loosing its touch...,The new season of parenthood is basically riding on the emotional/dramatic storyline of Christna's battle with cancer. Other than that their has been little intriguing development in the lives of other characers. Unless your still entertained by Sarah and her daughter's apparent lack of ability to truly committ to one man. Parenthood's strong point has always been multiple interesting storylines that beg for a resolution and are drawn out over many episodes. In this season the continual building of intrigue and story lines has weakened and become predictable.
5,Parenthood,"They have all been very entertaining from season one to four, can't wait for the next season. I loved each episode and couldn't wait to see each one. Love it!"
5,Best show on tv..,"With all the garbage on TV, and the reality shows they try to push as entertainment, Parenthood is one of the few good shows on the networks. The best thing about this show is how they deal with true life (family) issues with out getting to heavy or dramatic. Great cast, if you haven't seen it, do yourself a soild and check it out."
5,Favorite new drama,I just started watching this show right before Christmas. After episode one I was hooked. I spent the next weeks watching nothing but Parenthood on Netflix. I knew that I would have to buy the first half of season 4 because its in middle if the season now. Money well spent. Season does not disappoint. Excellent!
4,Great Show!,This show is full of twists and turns. Its a never ending saga of ups and downs amongst a family so close.
5,great tv show,I am a great fan ! I love the simplicity and true to real family life that the tv show presents!
5,Great show,"it is such a great show. I have watched every episode of this show, and cannot get enough of it."
4,Parenthood season 1-4,I love the whole season of Parenthood from 1 to 4. I did not realize that it was showing on 9. In fact there is some other show I want to watch in that time frame so I can't wait to purchase it hopefully soon.
5,Touching,Very good show. I cry every episode. Pretty true to life except for the fact that every character has been kissed by someone while they are in a relationship.
5,Great show,One of my friends just told me about the show Parenthood a few months ago. I use amazon prime to watch the first three seasons and am now caught up. The show is amazing! The characters and story lines are so complex and well developed. You will see yourself and your family members in various characters. I hope this show stays around for a long time. It's one that I'll be watching weekly now that I'm caught up.
5,Amazing,One of the best shows I have seen in a while. It will make you laugh make you cry it makes you feel as though your in the family.
2,Cute story - poor quality,"I was looking for a book with this subject for my 4 y.o. and bought this one based on the title and the description. It is not a morality tale although the story is cute and my son, who is just starting to read, liked being able to identify some of the words. The quality is terrible, though. On some pages the text is centered on the page but on others you really have to bend the spine to see the letters which flow from the very center to the very edge of the page."
1,Marketing to Children is Wrong,Attempting to make young children feel the need to buy your products is a disgusting practice. One popular method is to lower their self esteem and make them feel the only way to regain it is through buying a product.If you are involved in this practice you need to take a long look in the mirror and pray that you see doubt and shame looking back. Otherwise there's not much hope for you.
4,"Not as good at the original Plautus in Latin, but still....","What I enjoyed about this book is, that it brings the interested reader, who probably is not aquainted with Plautus or Roman comedy at all, the laughs of ancient rome near, which seem still quite modern and worth a laugh. At times one could criticize it is not close enough to Plautus original play, but even if it would be only a translation, there would be differences-and not the majority can still read a Latin text in its original. So why not complete the process to make it understandable and transfer the essence of the comedy into modern times in order to make it aproachable for a broader audience? In this respect the authors have done a fine job. Definitely this is a book worth reading, entertaining as well as educating, and highly recomandable!"
5,"The Passion - Mel says, ""Get this book"".","Mel Gibson had a show tonight on PAX TV of the making of, The passion ... He mentioned some sites he recommended and this book. I reviewed this book already but thought his recommend would be of interest. Diane"
5,A Good Foundation,"Great gift for friends who are curious about Christianity, but don't want to be overwhelmed.Includes the classic argument of C. S. Lewis (Lord, Liar or Lunatic), Josh McDowell also discusses the scientific validity of scripture. A good overview of Christian Apologetics."
5,A truly inspiring read,"Josh McDowell presents simple, clear arguments for the bible and Jesus Christ. Why we can trust the bible, why we can be assured of it's accuracy. That Jesus did live, die and was resurrected.He explains how we can trust information by comparing it to non-Christian history that is trusted, explaining the historical science, psychology and mathematics that assure what I believe already. The bible calls for faith but not blind faith in myth or story. My faith is now considerably stronger because there are very real answers to the questions I'm asking.If you have any questions regarding the validity of the bible or Christ's claims, read this book and you'll find a considerable amount of doubt will be removed and you can make your decisions on solid fact."
2,Not what I expected,"I got this book because I'm a new Christian and wanted to learn about the historical proofs about Christ to share with my husband. I had heard that this book was easy to read and understand for people seeking the truth about Christ but I was certainly mislead. This book was totally confusing and hard to understand. It is not written for a seeker or a skeptic, in my opinion. It appears to be written for the well-versed theologian. I felt more confused after reading it. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I feel the man's heart was in the right place and I enjoyed the parts about how the Bible manuscripts have been preserved and accurate even though they are so old. I was really disappointed."
3,A Good Short Read- It Makes its Point,"This short book is just perfect for the argument on who Jesus is.To most Christians, he is the Son of God and the point comes across very clearly to those that want to believe. Its not a re-reader for me because I do not suffer doubts of his Sonship and his Homoousian status with his Dad. Its a good book to throw at someone who suffers intellectual questions on who Jesus is.I have since followed up with Lee Strobel, Bart Ehrmann and Bruce Metzger. Its really all the same potato cooked in different ways.This book was my first potato.Warning to Agnostics: This is a Christian Book.Warning to Christians: God is not an intellectual exercise."
5,Powerful,"This book has a very interesting and detailed perspective. I would also highly recommend that sincere truth seekers get a copy of According to the Scriptures: Comparing What The Pastor Said With What the Master Said, Volume 1 by Bobby Woods. Available at ...- it is an empowering, fresh, and honest read."
5,Examine Christ's Claim and Make Your Own Determination,"I concur with the previous reviewer. This book is neither scholarly nor academic. It is, in a word, accessible.Leaving philosophy to the academics, McDowell takes the claims of Christ and examines them from a practical-not theological-view point.If Christ is not the Messiah, then what is He? Can he be a good moral teacher?The conclusion of the book is this: There are only two things you can do with Jesus: You can worship Him as God, or you can stone Him.For those of you who delight in philosophese, then C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity is an excellent source."
1,Put me off going to church.,In my late twenties I started to attend a non-denominational church because I was going through some issues in my life and for a time it seemed to help. Then some well-meaning members of the church lent me this book and it threw me completely off course. It was not a book that helped to cement my growing faith instead it basically destroyed it and I did not return to that church for a year. I found the arguments to be extremely weak and not likely to convince anyone who wasn't already strong in their faith. This is not going to help anyone who has questions about Christianity unless you are easily swayed. The only reason why this book has such a favorable following that I can see is that in the process of researching this book the author allegedly went from a non-believer to a believer and Christians see it as confirmation that they are right.
5,Everyone should read this book!,"If you are a Chrisitan and need to defend your faith, read it. If you aren't a Christian and doubt Christianity, read it. If you really don't think Jesus is the Son of God, then I challenge you to argue against this book. You can't ignore what's presented here -- either believe it or logically refute it."
5,A must read for a Christians,A good prespective on how the Bible was put together and proof of its total reliability.
1,"My question is, did anyone feel that it was a little above their IQ level....","I don't know if that was what Josh was trying to get at, but I was looking more for a simplified answer even though it's an extremely tough and touchy subject. But to the reader above, I felt it was a complete hack of a book with constant referencing to theologist who of course are not going to be wrong. I wanted to see their actual evidence or critical thinking not a term paper. I am christian by the way and was told to read this book by a friend but I just keep getting lost throughout the book and foreget what it was saying. Anybody else have this same opinion."
2,An exercise in logical fallacies.,"The book is an easy read and not unpleasant providing you don't really think about what it's saying.But as soon as you DO start thinking about it you discover that the entire book is built around repetitions and combinations of two serious logical fallacies.1. The false dichotomy.Jesus was either a good person and therefore everything he said must be true, or he lied about some things and was therefore some sort of insane devil incapable of doing good works.2. Circular logic. Uses quotes from the bible to prove the truth of what's said in the bible. Essentially saying the bible must be historical truth because the bible says it is and we know the bible doesn't tell lies.The logical fallacies are obvious when stated so bluntly and the prose wraps it up neatly to disguise them.But truthfully those two logical fallacies cover the entire content of this book. Once the reader has realized that then there is no new content which can be gleaned from further reading."
3,More Than a Carpenter,This was recommended to me by my uncle. I so far think it's okay but it's not going to change my mind about becoming a Christian because there are too many books out there that have answers to the questions raised in this book that can somewhat disprove (is that a word?) the statements in this book. I haven't read it all so will have to update this if any changes in my beliefs.
1,Reality is Important,"But reality is missing here. Josh's arguments are all based on the assumption that the gospels are 100% true and accurate. Unfortunately, if you are investigating something, you don't get to pick the outcome first. He conveniently ignores the idea that anything could be embellished or made up. This book is a simplistic argument for believers that aren't particularly knowledgeable."
5,Got Questions?,"Here in one compact volume is the evangelist's toolkit.Who was Jesus? What is Christianity really about? What about science and evolution? Can an old book written by dead guys be relevant? or real? What about good people who die? Why is there so much pain and suffering in the world?These basic questions are soundly answered with love, authority, and simplicity. Josh McDowell can be trusted to articulate the plain truth and speak in sound doctrine. With a heart for young people and solid doctrine underlying his faith, this former atheist explodes the myths of the popular culture and reveals the Truth, this Jesus, standing bright and bidding in His glory.I buy these books 6 or 8 at a time to give them away to seekers or those I witness to."
1,Ridiculous,"This book, which I was assigned to read for a Bible project, is a joke. Most of his argument simply attempts to solidify claims that the Bible has not been manipulated over the ages. Estblishing the fact that the Bible remains in context with its original manuscript hardly solidifies the claims of Christian doctrine. Also, he confidently states that because Jesus is neither a liar or lunatic, he can only be the Son of God. While my view may be a little biased, most of this book came in the form of insultingly blatant equivication attemping to refute solid claims against Christianity.By his presented examples, he has the capacity to reduce any atheistic intellect into a God-fearing Christian in under a minute."
1,I first began to doubt Christianity after reading this book,"The book is weak. There are holes in everything MacDowell says. What can I say. I was disappointed and my faith was harmed by this book. I personally don't think any apologetics succeed. The only way to believe is to simply believe, even if you know Christianity is wrong and the bible contradicts itself. Just bury that, suppress it and call it the sinful flesh, and believe. That is a much more effective way to have biblical faith than entering the arenas of reason or rationalism as in all such cases, Christianity fails."
5,Great for those who don't understand who Jesus really is.,"For anyone who doesn't know that Jesus is the son of God, and doesn't understand how this can be true, this book is great. Many do not think that Jesus can possibly be God's son, and believe Him to be a mere man. This will definetely provide them with information to show Jesus' deity."
2,Nothing new,"This book is generally a restatement of a work called ""Tryal of the Witnesses of the Resurrection"" written in the 18th century, and suitably refuted by great philosopher David Hume. Why this old argument about testimony of miracles has resurfaced in the 20th century is beyond me, expect maybe because modern Christians are feeling increasing pressure from ""science"" to ""prove"" their religion.It's okay to be Christian; just don't put any pretensions of rationality behind your faith. Even if you do, there are better proofs of God's existence (I recommend the Cosmological Argument). If you're interested, read this book, but then take a Philosophy of Religion course to see how easily the book's claims can be refuted."
5,This book is Great,I am a youth pastor in the Las Vegas valley and we used this book for our student leaders. They love it. It is so cool to see them getting so much out of a really simple book. The way Josh breaks it down and makes it so simple to understand is the best part. I would totally recomend this book to anyone wanting to learn about Jesus or grow more with Him.
1,Invalid Argument,"The Bible is the most convinient book ever assembled. In it ANYONE can find support for ANY action. For example, during the Civil War both South and North claimed that their actions, in favor or against slavery, were supported by the Bible. If you dispute this fact, please inform yourself.I could go on and on to present examples like the one above, but I'll just say that ""the Bible is not even wrong""; meaning: any intelligent human being won't ever discuss the Bible. Since the Bible is out of discussion, any argument based only on the validity of the Bible is rendered invalid."
5,"Got what I wanted, and quickly.",I am grateful for this book and I am happy with the quality of the book. I got it in a timely manner. Thank you.
1,Good enough for the choir,"If you doubt, this book may not help. As you read it, you probably will see thru MacDowell's arguments and long for more effective proof of Jesus. Consider the prophecy's for example. Read any of them in their original context and it's fairly clear that they were not prophecying the Messiah. Besides, how do we know that the fulfillments happened, just because it says so in the gospels? His Naive defense of the historical reliability of the New Testament is enough to make you a hindu or an atheist. Anything but a Christian."
1,"Inaccurate, mis-leading and badly arguedeview of specially c","A complete travesty of an historical study. A true historian searches for all relevant sources, reviews them with a dispasionate view for the truth, formulates and defends his arguments. This author does none of the above. I doubt strongly that any of those who gave this book a glowing review have ever bothered to read and understand serious, objective history in this field."
4,"Good ""Summary"" of the existence of Jesus.","I almost thought about giving this book three stars but I decided to be nice. Josh McDowell is a good writer, but less of a historian. He does a good quick swift job of making his points. I especially love the Lord, Liar, or Lunatic chapter in which I agreed with 100% after reading. But overall the book was too short! If you are going to write an analytical historical book, you should back it up with as much historical information as possible. For a historical book, it did not cover enough. And Josh McDowell should have confronted the issues that other historian's might take. This was done poorly in this book. He resorted to refuting arguments made by flight attendants and philosophy teachers that probably have studied biblical texts very little. Overall, a decent book."
5,A Great Must Read Book!,This book is awesome! It really explains a lot and has great detail! I HIGHLY recommend every Christian to read this at least once!
1,Mindless tripe,"While I am an atheist, I try to be fair to pro-religious argumentation. Toward this end I will assert for the record that there are some very good defenders of Christianity out there. But Josh McDowell definitely isn't one of them; and any person of reasonable intelligence coming to this book can only conclude that Christianity is doomed if its defenders can do no better than this. This is completely mindless tripe, nothing more."
1,what kind of person does this provoke thought in?,"I felt as though i was reading a term paper from a college freshman. I think the fact that this book appeals so highly to those of the christian faith says alot about their intelligence level. My father recommended this book to me ""not to convert me"" but to enhance my religous view. All it did was reassure me how unwilling most christian writers are to confront the more powerful arguments against them through egoism. If you're trying to impress people, start a level or two above ""Dick and Jane."""
4,Thumbs up from a former atheist,"Like so many, I was dragged kicking and screaming to belief; the road I took started when I realized that I, like other non-believers, was twisting science and the Bible around to bolster my own arguments (something Christians are accused of doing by non-believers). McDowell had to face the same hypocrisies and come to terms with them and he does an outstanding job. Keep in mind that he is appealing to your brain, not your heart and spirit, and says as much. He also alludes that just going through the mental exercises does not equal an acceptance. By all means, if you're an atheist (or were one or know one), shell out a few bucks. You'll be glad you did."
5,"Christianity is not a ""blind faith""","I have recommended this book to many friends, chritians and non-christians alike. Josh McDowell challenges christians to love God with their mind too (part of the greatest commandments), and challenges atheists and others about Jesus' resurrection, His claims to deity, and the Biblical records. Josh himself used to be an atheist who tried to argue against Christianity, but found his arguments wouldn't stand up (his own words about himself, see the back cover). This book covers interesting theories about the resurrection, whether it happened or not, how reliable are the Biblical records, and the messianic prophecies. It is an easy read and easy to understand."
1,Here's an example of the faults of McDowell's logic.,"I read this book, and I am appalled that anybody would be decieved enough to believe this crap as an exercise of logic. If you would like a demonstration of how badly his arguments work, I'll be happy to show you one. One argument of his that I had a lot of trouble with was his ""trilemma"" of Jesus, in which he deduces that since Jesus was not a liar or a lunatic, he must be the Lord. He seems to refuse to believe that there could be more then three options. This argument is about as valid as coming across a mouse, and deciding it must be one of the following three animals: a fish, a cat, or a mouse. Reducing the fish and cat out of the possible categories does not make a mouse a dog."
1,excrementally horrid evangelical cheerleading,"I read the book with an open mind, but found McDowell's argument to be absolutely childish. Supposedly, he began as an atheist and became a Christian after doing a little research and being confronted with overwhelming ""evidence"" that Jesus was the ""Son of God."" Truly, I think he must have had a head injury of some sort, because the excrement he presents is not evidence. It's the biggest piece of rubbish I have ever read. Period."
5,Glorious Too!,"This excellent follow-up anthology contains such classic Gorey works as The Beastly Baby, The Pious Infant, The Gilded Bat, The Chinese Obelisks, The Deranged Cousins, and The Disrespectful Summons."
2,Fun the first day,"I was so excited to get this game because my friend had the snes version but i didnt have snes so i got btn for ps and its great the first day u play it but after that its soooo boring! I cant grow the plants every time i do they dont fully develop or die when they are developed all the way. You do the same things all the time talk, walk, take care of farm and animals, try to woo a girl which is so hard. The festivals are way to hard to win i would not reccomend this unless ur ALL about farming."
1,warning about this game,"This game is really boring. The plot is to run around as this little kid as u try to run a farm. Oh wait it gets better you have a dog, i mean wow ingenious. It doesn't get much better from there. The graphics are average the story well i dont think there is one and the premise..stupid. Buy only if u think your a farmer or something."
5,Best Harvest Moon,"The best Harvest Moon yet, even better that the one for PS2. I love this game, and it is addictive, yet I have never beat it. I always get 2 years through and start over because i thought i missed something, which I did not. Fun none the less."
5,Harvest Moon,"Hello, I am a big fan of Harvest Moon. I bought the gameboy one and really liked it and then I found out about the 64 version so I saved up and bought that. When I found out they had a PSX one I bought a PSX -JUST- to play HM. The town is a lot bigger than in the 64 version and theres better graphics except the game is slower too. So I would reccoomend this game to an HM fan b/c my cousin got it as her first HM game and she was very confused."
5,Amazing Game,"This game is amazing, i have played it for gameboy, snes, and n64. I have beaten all of them, and i still love the games. I personnally love this game because it lets you raise your own livestock, which i could never do in real life, and you build your own farm any way you want it to be. you can add rooms to your house like a bathroom, a greenhouse etc."
4,"Funny, cute, hard work","This game ist like the others before: working on a farm, feeding your animals...but it is as funny as the others before, maybe more, 'cause you have more possibilities what you can do in this game. To be honest, you cannot explain what makes this game worth to buy it, you MUST play it by yourself, then you can see, what I mean!!Have fun"
4,Possibly Natsume`s best work.,"If you were to compare this to any of the other Harvest Moon game this one would definitely take the cake. The town is much bigger than the others and is not crowded into one screen. You also have a rucksack so you can gather fruits and not only be able to carry one thing at a time.There is a bar, which means drinking but this is nothing different from most of the other Harvest Moon`s. I give this game a huge thumbs up and encourage any RPG fan to give this game a try."
5,way cool game,This is the best game in the Harvest Moon series ever. To me this is way much better than Save the Homeland. The controls are easy to master. I give the sound a 4.5 cause I've heard better than this. It also great festivals but they take up the whole day in the game. The graphics have been improved but they still don't lose the cute animation which is what I like about it. It's too bad you can't ride your horse out of the farm. I have no complains about them other animals. The best thing is you can get married and have children but its guite useless cause they don't do anything but take up space in your house. Over all this is one of the best games I've ever played.
5,This game gets better and better.,"I am maria I have played good games for along time and I know good games. So far so good this Harvestmoon generation has made it to playstation 2 I cant wait for the next game to come out. This game is just a bit of an upgrade for the n64 version. This game isnt to bad they added some stuff though. Well let me tell you. The girls are differnt. You get to cook food to get girls to like you or impress the town folk. The chicken,sheep,and cow thing is differnt to. This game will get you to use more money than before. There are new festivals.The upgrades for tools cost alot of money. There are are more veg. I wont give any secrets..."
4,Polymer Clay Pasta Machine,I work with polymer clay and have used several machines. This is my favorite. It holds up better than other brands that I have used.
3,Good for around the house,"These are true to their size. The terry upper part isn't as plush as I thought it would be, but the rubber soles are significant enough. These are like light-weight terry socks with a full slipper sole. Kind of weird, but in a good way!"
2,meh,"These booties are not made for wide feet at all, the rubber sole has curled up around my front toes & they do not lay flat when I wear them. Also the material is not very warm, so if you are looking to get these as a slipper they wont be warm."
2,moon boots,Ummmmhhhh...not quite what I thought. The elastic around your ankles will become loose very quickly making it uncomfortable to wear. Cheaply made if you ask me. Wouldn't recommend purchasing.
4,Moon Boots,I bought the Pink Moon boots and I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable and cute it is. I am very happy with my product.
5,Moon slippers,"Great, I have worn them for years and like the idea that they can be worn on floors and/ or carpeting.Please do not use this email address anymore.Thank you."
1,Wildflowers of the Northeast,"Did not realize this was only photos in postcard format. While the photography was good, most of the plants were exotic species that have escaped cultivation. Would not have purchased this if I had seen it first. I was looking for a book on native wildflowers of the Northeast."
1,Kindle edition was not proofread! Do not buy!,"I would have liked to have read this book, but sadly neither Amazon, the publishers (Llewellyn Publications), nor the author have not proofread the ebook. There are frequent errors throughout the entire ebook caused by the Optical Character Reader (OCR) that was used to digitize it, and the mistakes are jarring and make this book a chore to read. Amazon, Llewellyn Publications, and Mr. Penczak have a duty to proof and correct the ebook they are selling. These aren't minor errors. For example, the title page lists the author's last name as ""?enczak"". These errors are throughout the book. I find it unacceptable that Amazon and the publishers and author have not proofread their kindle version, and I recommend not buying this ebook."
3,101,"Im beyond 101 books, but I thought to give this a try as it was recommended as a good foundation. 101 at its most basic. And by basic I mean if you have only just heard the word Wicca or Pagan and have no clue what it all entails basic. I gave this to a friend so it wasnt wasted."
5,The Inner Temple of Witchcraft,"This is a fantastic book for the beginner into the practice of the Wiccan Arts and Witchcraft. This book is very well written and easy to understand. Most people have the idea that Wicca and Witchcraft is all about casting spells. This book prepares the individual INTERNALLY before attempting to concentrate, raise energy and send it into the universe. The book teaches the student how to look inward at his or herself and prepare the mind, body and soul for the external working of Wicca and Witchcraft. This is very important before attempting magick. It concentrates on meditation and enhancing the psychic ability of the student therefore preparing them to channel their will and energy to create change in the universe. This book is a must for any beginning student into this wonderful, gentle and soul strengthening religion."
5,Finally,"I finally found what I was looking for in an occult/witchcraft book. It is so intelligently written and easy to understand, but it is NOT light reading or fluff. The author really gets at the meat of 'The Mysteries' and leaves out the silly teenage nonsense (there is no Wicca 101 stuff either for those who are looking for that). After reading a dozen or more highly recommedned witchcraft and Wicca books and feeling they lacked any meaningful content, this book was refreshing. In fact, you don't need to be interested in Witchcraft to find this book useful in your life. I think this book actually helped me pinpoint what I was looking for in a spiritual path in that this is all about the Inner Temple part of the practice and not at all about the rituals, tools, robes, Goddesses and such. I believe the next book in the series deals with those things. But for my purposes, seeking a more enlightened state of being and understanding the great mysteries of our universe, this was a great help."
4,Really diverse,"This book is very imformative and also the author gives his opinion on some of the subjects mentioned in the book. This book covers a wide array of areas, great book for people wanting to know the truth about witchcraft. I really liked his point of view on things."
5,the inner temple of witchcraft. bestbook.,"i lovee this book, helped me out alott. Christopher Penczak is a really good author i love all his books :)"
4,"""Sharing the Stuff of Life that Matters""","I recommend this book, Watered Down Coke by Nicole Gabhart, especially for teenage girls. It addresses some issues that girls really need to think through before making decisions that could change their lives forever.Some of the issues discussed range from commitments to their parents and friends, to dating guidelines, drinking alcohol, and sex. All of these are life-changing topics from a conservative viewpoint and I believe they are handled in a very dignified and challenging way that will touch hearts and minds.It sends a message of love to girls reminding them that they are each unique and have a specific purpose in this life. As you know, these are words that every girl needs to hear.You'll be able to identify with much of the story and more importantly, you'll want to remember the way the main message was clearly protrayed."
4,Excellent resource,I needed this book for a class that I am currently taking. It is an excellent resource that I feel I will use even after I complete this class.
3,From Reader to Reading Teacher: Issues and Strategies for Second Language Classrooms,"This was merely a text for a graduate course I'm taking; I really don't have much to say, except it was fairly interesting but very dry like so many textbooks are.Thanks!dcl"
5,Great for lunches,"This is a perfect size for lunches. The cold cup concept is definitely an innovation, because in the past, you had to keep a separate container for your cold items.Now, you just pop up the vent on the lid, and nuke the container, provided you remove the cold cup if you're using it.However, it works equally well without the cup, if you want three hot courses for your meal.The only minus is that you don't want to put very liquidy items in this container, unless you are keeping it level while you're travelling. The lid does not seal each individual compartment, nor would it, to get full advantage from the Tupperware venting system."
4,wagon train,The videos are good quality of black and white. The person announcing the opening of each program his skin is blue in color.Each program takes me back to the orginal time and are clean of bad language and have a good story line.
1,Terrible example for children,"I have twin boys that are almost 5. This is one of last books I would read them. I don't want to read to them about things that naughty children do. I'd rather teach them what good children do. It sets a poor example for children when they reward them with a trip to the zoo; popcorn, ice cream, and balloons included. I know this story was meant to come across as funny and cute but I would steer clear of this book that shows some pretty terrible parenting."
2,missing pages,"The book was missing two pages when it came. We've enjoyed the story and felt that we would just keep the book and we made up our own ending for the last page (which is missing) and there is another page missing in the middle of the book, which we also made up a story for."
4,"Great Mic...great sound, versatility and price","This mic is solid, great freq response....crisp...open...I love it...Been doing recording (both professional and personal) for over 25 years...What a bargain. I am buying a couple more for Podcast and general recording of music, voice, guitar, etc...The option/versatility to go from battery power for the ultimate in portable recording (no phantom power required) to phantom power in the studio is great. Not a whole lot of difference in performance between the two. Must buy for amateur/professionals."
1,Drill is OK but the changer and battery did not work.,I bought this drill because already had a similar one and thought I'd get two and share batteries. From day 1 the battery charger that came with the drill did not work. I ended up using the battery from my old drill. Then a few days later the new battery stopped taking a charge.I have emailed Skilshop numerous times in the past month. I also emailed Amazon about this problem but I have not seen a response.
4,Looks can be deciving,"Ok, so the cover can be deciving. The point that WCW was trying to get across was that they were honoring their legends. So naturally they displayed some on the cover. If you watched wrestling in the 80's-90's you will love this tape. They bring in a lot of the older wrestlers for maybe their last match.Also they induct them into their hall of fame. Great matches incluse: Davey Boy Smith vs Vader, Arn Anderson vs Barry Windham (Windham juices), and Dory Funk Jr. vs Nick Bockwinkel. This tape is worth buying."
4,All Good except Main Event,"The Tag Title steel Cage was ok,The Rude/Ordorff Vs Rhodes/Kensaki was good,The Sting/Nailz was horrible but the World Title match was sorry since it didn't end cleanly butVader had to get himself DQ'd to keep the Belt."
2,do not buy this tape,this tape is terrible flair and sting dusty rhodes are on the cover and arent even in it the only reason i gave it two stars is becouse of the austin pillman vs.rick steamboart and shane douglas early in ther carears
1,Horrible,"This video is an indication of why I will never understand the logic of WCW. YOU HAVE RIC FLAIR! USE HIM! But of course, being WCW, they didn't. They did have the good sense to put him on the cover of the video so you would buy it and then later find out that he's not even in it. I would call that false advertising, which last time I heard was illegal but it doesn't really matter now because Vince McMahon(who has the common sense to put guys like Flair in main events on Raw and in other great matches on PPV's) owns WCW. Who did WCW always go to when the young guys they tried to give the proverbial ""push"" to falied to capitalize on it? I believe the answer is the Nature Boy himself. So in closing, if you want this tape for a Ric Flair match don't make the mistake I did by buying it."
2,Slamborre 93 a pretty bad show,Wcw decided to try something new in 93 when everything was going bad for them and this was one of the things.A terrible card with a decent main event but having the british bulldog main event for a wcw title on a major ppv should not happen especially only this far in his career.Rest of the card is throwaway.
1,"Unfortunately, not good at all","Trapped Ashes is one of those films tht could've been great, but ended up a total dud. The one bright light in the whole film is Gibson, who, while a bit hammy, comes off an genuinely creepy. The rest of the 4 tales are a predictable mish-mash of pseudo horror, light gore, and gratuitous nudity and sex. All the directors involved more or less seemed to be phoning n their work, and even Saxon, the only other credible actor in the cast (the rest seemed like they were in a high-school play), pretty much sleepwalked his lines. Interesting that something like Tales From The Crypt, done -- what? -- 30 years earlier, was far superior. Save your money; look for it on cable some late night."
4,Phil is a Hoot!,"I love this old timey, pre-PC stuff! If you are hyper-sensitive, maybe you ought to find somweone else to listen to (he makes very good natured jokes about women) but for the rest of us, Phil is great."
1,Get them locally,"This is a collection of 6 ""hot"" sauces that only cost about $1-$2 individually. After adding shipping, you're paying at least 50% extra. You can get 4 of these at Food Lion: Cholula, Bufalo, Tapatio, & ElYucateco. All of these are mild, ElYucateco is a little hotter than a jalapeno, the rest are weaker.Skip Bufalo all together. I've found 2 varieties, both were bland, and you might as well just pick up some MILD Tostitos or store brand salsa.Cholula, Tapatio, & ElYucateco are worth trying, but don't waste you're money here, unless you really can't find them in a grocery store. Be sure to look around, my local store has all of these in their Mexican section, however they also have other hot sauces in Condiments, Asian, & Produce.Also, this set should most certainly NOT be given to a real hot sauce lover, they'll have very likely already tried them."
5,Great gift,Purchased these for my son who is a hot sauce lover. He says they are awesome. Great packaging and a variety of flavors.
1,low quality sauces from wal mart & taquerias,"not for the ""hot sauce lover"". high price for sauces that cost less than a buck 50 on average. i am a hot sauce lover and if received this as a gift i would probably put them in the trash or re gift it to somebody that hates good hot sauce."
1,I really dislike this bag.,"I bought this bag based on the Amazon reviews and I completely disagree with most of them. This bag is bulky, and the lining is so thin between compartments that the bag has no structure. If you put something in the middle compartment, it sticks out in to the outer compartments and everything feels like a big mess. The bag isn't deep enough and feels bulky on my shoulder when filled (not over-stuffed).Not a good bag."
4,Pretty good travel bag,"I bought this bag to tote around all of the things that I needed to carry on my recent vacation in Hawaii. It looks really nice and has plenty of room for sun-block, cameras, caps, sweatshirts, sunglasses etc. The only problem that I had with it was that all three compartments are exactly the same inside, meaning there are six zippered pockets that all look alike. I found myself getting frustrated digging for objects in my purse. Also, by the end of the trip my shoulder was pretty sore from carrying the heavy bag. Some padding in the handles might have helped. Overall, I am pleased with this product and will use it again for future trips."
2,Baggallini Bagg from Amazon,"I was very disappointed that the bag was not as photographed. A key selling point was the photo window on the small enclosed bag pictured. If the photos cannot be trusted, I am going to be very cautious about buying items from Amazon."
3,Baggallini only bag,On the website the bag I ordered was brown color. But the name of the color was Dark Olive. I noticed that the color on the picture and the name of it did not match each other. But trusted the picture. I was and I am deeply disappointed when I got it. I checked website again ind saw brown color. The bag is good but color really was not as expected. And even now if you check on your site the color this color is wrong. Sorry. Larisa
2,"Moderately interesting, but mechanical.","The author loves to tell about the numerous special forces' hits that he participated in, and the descriptions are cruelly fascinating (kind of like rubber-necking at an accident). But his analysis is one dimensional and simplistic ... according to him the world's (or at least the western world's) problems would be solved if we assassinated anyone we don't like."
4,A welcome revelation,"For me, as someone who was involved in MSIA in Australia, Peter McWilliams' book is an eye-opener. It explains, from an insider's perspective, what was happening when the controversies took hold and - quite frankly - it has changed my sunny attitude about John-Roger and the Movement. Just like McWilliams, I was depressed when I did Insight and joined MSIA, and feel now that I probably wasted 20 years of my life devoted to something that wasn't actually working for me ... but I was programmed to believe otherwise. Fortunately I wasn't financially ripped off like Peter McWilliams was. I wish he were still alive so I could thank him for writing this book!"
2,gift wrap a loser but company apologized for failing to include gift wrap,"I ordered gift wrapping and the scarf was wrapped in ""natural"" tissue. No box, no ribbon. Disappointing. After I posted a review describing my dissatisfaction, I was contacted by the company. They explained that, in the crush of holiday orders, they had failed to wrap my gift and were refunding the charge for gift wrapping. The natural tissue was their customary non-gift wrapped presentation.I am impressed that the company tracked me down, not an easy task since Amazon will not release my contact information. I feel that the refund is an honorable resolution to their failure to include the gift wrapping with my order."
4,love the bowls not the color,"I love the wonderlier bowl set. I almost constantly have a least one of the three bowls in use. The lids were a little stiff at first, but after soaking them in hot water for five minutes and then placing them on the bowls, they were much more flexable. The lids seem to get softer the more I use them. I would highly recommend these bowls! My only complaint was that the bowls were NOT the color shown in the picture. I much preferred the color in the picture. Irregardless of the color, the bowls still do the job and are much loved."
3,Not same color as pictured,I ordered the three bowls that should have been semi-clear with a blue lid. I received three different color bowls. That was the only dissapointment. The bowls still function perfectly though.
1,Bootlegged Music - Look For Other LWJ Recordings,"These recordings don't faithfully represent the quality of the recordings of Little Willie John.The reason is simple, some of the recordings on the collection are bootlegged, non-authorized copies!If you really want to hear the songs in a high quality setting then the Little Willie John - Nineteen Sixty Six: The David Axelrod and HB Barnum Sessions (also available through Amazon.com) is the collection that you want!These recording are made from the masters of the original studio recordings.http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords;=little+Willie+john+nineteen+sixty+six&x;=0&y;=0Other quality Little Willie John CD's released through ACE Records UK are also available through Amazon.comhttp://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords;=little+Willie+john+King+Early+Session&x;=0&y;=0Please take a listen to these! It's Little Willie John ... At His Best!"
3,Harmless sexy fun.,"Not enough story for my tastes. Mostly sex scenes. Well written however. If you're looking for a bit of naughty self comfort, this will appeal.A young woman goes to a manision where she has plenty of sex, small amount of self discovery, and eventually finds love. Like I said, not much story but some harmless well written sex scenes."
1,is this for real?,"if you are looking for a story with a plot, you will not find it in this book. reading this book reminded me of watching EYES WIDE SHUT with tom cruise. i guess i am niave because i kept wondering if this kind of stuff really happens. if you think you would enjoy reading about a love triangle involving the sex lives of two guys and a woman, then this is the book to read."
3,"a good read, unexpected attachments","This is my second Emma Holly book. I liked it, a lot. Other reviewers have mentioned the lack of plot and that's true, but it's still a good read. The thing is,I didn't really care one way or the other about the female character. The love stories involving her were shallow at best. The two male characters, however, had a really sweet love story. That one I believed with no problem and I really liked them both. Bottom line, the book is worth buying and reading. I might not re-read it, but I did enjoy it."
2,A disappointment,"I've read all of Emma Holly's erotic novels. This is the first that has truly disappointed me. Character development is usually a strong point for Ms. Holly, though not so here -- the heroine and her cohorts are stock. The story was cliche ridden and the erotic passages were not up to the author's usual standard. It's not bad, it's just ordinary, and I expect more than ordinary from an Emma Holly book."
2,For Teens?,"This is pretty racy, I'm just surprised to see this on the same page as Lemony Snicket, C.S. Lewis and Meg Cabot. Is this an oversight?"
2,Only so-so writing this time around,"Not really thrilled with this book -- I don't think it's the strongest example of how well Emma Holly can write.Loved the story when it involved B.G. and Eric, but given the heroines she's created in other books, Charity is not so great. This is strictly personal opinion; obviously plenty of other people found alot to admire in this book. I'm keeping it, but only for the Eric & B.G. interactions.Too bad Emma doesn't write a real love story strictly between two guys, because she really has a knack for those scenes. In this one, the Charity character was just interference."
4,Very sexy,I've read her other erotica and wasn't always excited about it. This is the first one I really like. Be warned that the males are bisexual and even that is well written. You will enjoy this one.
3,Too much for me.,"I am new to Emma Holly's work. The relationships between the characters in this book were very interesting. There was a little too much of the threesome stuff in here for me. I'm not used to that type of situation. I was, however, entertained by the story and wouldn't necessarily tell anyone not to read it. It was one that kept your eyes open wide and wanting to see how the story would unfold."
1,Oster Wine Bottle Opener,"Received this product on October 16. It is now November 29. This thing does not work. I have charged it all day, I am not using plastic corks, it worked for maybe 8 wine bottles. As you push the down button, it stops half way and still does not lift the cork. This is the worst product I have ever purchased!!!! I did not even want to give this a star!!!"
1,In the minority,Tried this opener over a one week period on 5 bottles of wine that all had natural corks. The Oster went O for 5 so it's now being returned.
2,no good!!!,This bottle opener doesn't open the bottles in one shot. I have to try two times. On the third i have to use the portable one. wish i can return it.
1,total waste of money,"We have tried this on three wine bottles and will not use it again. It goes into the cork and then when you try to pull the cork out,it just doesn't work. Worse then that, you can't push the cork in;nor can use a regular wine opener; basically just throw those bottles out.I will go back to ""the rabbit"" or the old fashioned type. This is my first totally negative ad. Save your money!"
4,Neat Little Gadget,"I bought several of these for Holiday gifts and kept one for ourselves.We have enjoyed this; it's a neat little item....But please read the instructions! After a few uses, I thought it was broken, but it was really a case of not reading the directions!"
2,caution,I've had it for about 6 months and it's now doesn't completely remove the cork on some bottles. I wouldn't buy this again.
1,Stopped Working!!!,"Can not recommend, it didn't even work 30 days and opened only 10 bottles. It now starts to open a bottle an stalls/stops after 2 seconds without success."
5,It never fails,"This wine bottle opener has never failed me. I recharged it once after using many, many times. It's fun and easy to use."
1,Unacceptable,"This opener appears to be powerful enough. But it has failed consistently to fully retrieve a cork. Usually half way is max.If there is a technique in using this,then it's on me. But I'm sure convenience, central placement over the cork, and a down press on the switch was the intent of design, not some tricky secret. It's a returnable item.I think defective would be the best way to describe it."
3,good,It works but the material seems to be weak and cheap.Made of thin plastic and im wondering how much longer it will last
3,Sucks for plastic corks,"Works like a charm on natural corks.Is a real pain in the tail for plastic corks;not extracting them, but removing the corksfrom the Opener!My 91 year old motheer-in-law has gien itback to us because of the plastic cork problem.My wife has gone back the ""aiters' corkscrew""because of the plastic cork problem."
2,Have to pull,Now I know why this is so inexpensive. You have to pull the whole unit and bottle apart once the cork is electrically twisted in there. I wanted the cork to be pulled out but I guess that was wishful thinking. Sad that this unit takes a up a precious electrical outlet that simply saves me afew seconds of twisting. I guess I will have to pay more for a bottle opener that you don't have to put between your legs and pull the heck out of the top. I think it's a neat toy and so far works well and would give an extra half star just be fair because I was naive to what this was supposed to do
4,"Fun, but doesn't last.","Got this for Christmas 2009 and used it a TON. My hubby and I love it. It did however quit working in February 2011, so it only lasted a little over a year. I would guess we opened about 300 bottles with it (hubby drinks reds and I drink whites), so I think it had a hard life. We ordered another one right away because we loved it so much. If you don't drink as much wine as we do, then it will probably last you awhile. Otherwise, plan on replacing it every couple years. I'm giving it only 4 stars because of this reason."
5,"Bought on a whim, but don't know how I lived without it","So I saw this on the deal of the day for 50% off. I decided to give it a try. I'm not a huge wine drinker, but mostly because I hate dealing with the pesky corks. Once I got this in, I decided to charge it and attempt using it. Surprisingly, it was super simple with no effort from me. I've had it for a few months now, and I have even tried using it on sparkling wines with the huge mushroom corks and though the fit is tight, the opener still works flawlessly.I like this so much I debating buying it as a wedding gift for my brother. No one should be without one if they're a wine drinker."
2,Save your $$$,"While the Oster works as well as similar products (electric Rabbit & others) and is far cheaper, all of them suffer from the same defect, namely, as soon as a cork or even a small chunk of cork breaks & gets lodged inside the unit, it will no longer work. The Oster has the advantage over the Rabbit, in that it can be dismantled & cleaned. I got an extra month of use out of it that way. However, after taking it apart & cleaning, I was never able to get the outer shell to properly snap back into place & had a big open gap on the side from then on. When it clogged up again, this time with small cork debris, almost a powder, I decided I'd had enough & tossed it. While the concept is great & initial enjoyment substantial, the fact that none of the units currently on the market can easily be opened for cleaning is a major draw back. One can only hope that the next generation of this product will rectify the problem."
5,excellent for arthritic hands!,"I love this product, but it does have a couple of draw backs. I have a very hard time turning any type of screw wine opener due to arthritis in my hands. This product takes all that away because you just sit it on top of the bottle and press the button. However, you still have to hold the bottle to keep it from turning with the opener, and the opener has to be fully charged. The first time I tried to use it, the opener stopped before fully removing the stopper and then I really had a hard time getting it out! Every household that used wine should own one of these!"
4,Well... It works,"It's big... it takes up counter space to charge. It still takes some strength to hold the bottle in place while starting the process (might not be good if you are looking for an elderly person or someone with arthritis).It works... it removes the cork. It isn't fast, and it it's pretty loud - but it does the job as advertised."
5,Great Wine Opener,"I received this Oster wine opener two years ago as a Christmas Gift. It's still going strong, so I bought one for my brother. The model he had broke after just a few uses. He loves this one!"
5,Awesome Wine Opener,"I don't drink alot of wine and one of the reasons is I am terrible with the old cork screw type of opener. Now, I never have to do that again. I was given a gift certificate to Amazon from a co-worker and after seeing a friend use this opener, I knew exactly what I was spending my gift certificate on! It works with no hassle at all. It's design is sleek and even looks good on the counter top. I am not saying I will ever become a huge wine drinker but I sure look like I know what I am doing when I entertain. I would recommend this to anyone. It would make a great gift."
1,Not up to it!,We bought this opener in light of the many glowing reviews and the claim it would open any type of cork. Couldn't wait to try it! What a disappointment - tried it twice on synthetic corks and the auger wouldn't even penetrate the cork.
1,Not As Advertised,"This opener was said to be great for arthritis sufferers. I have moderate pain in my hands and searched for the easiest of openers, which this claimed to be. Forget it! I tried 6 different bottles, and each time, the opener skewed to the side, no matter how careful I was, shredded the cork and came out empty. If the shipping hadn't cost half of the product's price, I'd have sent it back. Now I'm sampling screwtop wines."
1,Doesn't work as promised,"I followed the instructions, many times, but still can't get the cork pulled out of the wine bottle.The Oster wine opener cork-screw goes in just fine. However, instead of pulling out the cork, the cork-screw just reverses direction and comes out of the cork. I'm 75 and bought this after reading a review on how great it was for older folks with arthritis. Well, maybe I have a ""lemon"" but I certainly would love someone from Oster tell me is I'm doing something wrong.Thank you for the opportunity to bring this to someone's attention"
4,Cork remover.,Has worked great the last few times. The battery does not hold a chrage well. We were hoping to charge it once a month. But we are having to recharge every week and after we used it only two or three times.
1,Save the box!! Save the receipt!! It is JUNK,"Worked well for 2 bottles. On third bottle, motor whined to a grinding halt, overwhelmed by a plastic cork in a new bottle. Good concept, good design, but horrible implementation with construction worthy only of a toy. Save your money, get something worthwhile. Either that, or keep the receipt and box until you've opened a dozen bottles."
5,A great item...a great gift!!,I have one of these wine openers and love it. I also have given it as gifts and anyone that drinks wine will love this item!!
4,Great Product,I only wish I had discovered this thing a long time ago. It would be a 5 star except it is not quiet enough for me. Great product. I recommend it to anyone looking for a better way to open a bottle of wine.
2,"Inadequate, unreliable opener","On several occasions, when I have needed the opener, it has been discharged with the light on the top of it having been out. Usually, wiggling it will get it to charge again, but this hasn't been useful when I needed to open a bottle right at that time. Last night, when I again needed to open a bottle, it had completely failed, and no matter what I tried, I couldn't get it to charge again and have the light on top come on. It is now relegated to the garbage. Maybe I was just unlucky and got a lemon."
2,"Noisy, slow, shreds corks, doesn't open all corks","I bought this product because the large volume of Amazon ratings were positive. I was surprised when I used the opener for the first time at how LOUD it is, which seems awkward when opening at a dinner table. I was also surprised at how tightly I needed to hold the wine bottle - so much so that I often feel I am going to crack the bottleneck. The corkscrew often shreds corks, and this isn't because of our storage, as we store all our wines sideways to keep the corks moist. With newer, wax-based corks, this opener often has difficulty, leading us to use a manual screw. The form is nice, the look is lovely, but the product is not as wonderful as I expected based on the feedback here."
1,Not Happy!,"I used this product one time and the button broke and it won't operate at all. My neighbor bought one and has enjoyed it, but mine wasn't made very well. I don't recommend purchasing this product."
1,Oster a piece of crap,"Oster wine openers are a piece of crap. Went through 2 of them. Each one lasted about 18 months. They strip out on synthetic corks. Don't waste your money. Go go for the Waring that is more durable. But keep i mind that one needs to be charged all the time or it goes to crap. Would someone make a good automatic cork screw please??Stay away from the Oster. I mean, come on, what do you expect for $18.00? Be smart."
5,Great Job Oster,"This rate is made after I first used the item on the day it arrived. The price, (got 2 for $30.00), the performance, the look and how easy it is to use: 5 STARS.I only wished the light goes off automatically after the device is fully charged, but it is not a big deal. I will be happy to recommend.THANK YOU AMAZON.I will add more comment in the future if necessary. So far rate on day one: 20/20, A+, 5 STARS.Good job Oster"
5,love it,"the best invention ever, I am very happy with the product. I saw it work once and was hooked. I gave one to my friend"
5,Electric Wine-Bottle Opener,Excellent product sturdy and well made. Works as advertised and makes a great gift for wine lovers. The price is ideal and well within anyones budget.
5,Works Great!,We got this for Christmas and I don't know what the other people are doing to theirs but ours works great and we've opened a lot of wine bottles with it since December! We've had one cork break on the screw portion and that was because the cork had dried out which was no fault of the opener. I highly recommended this to anyone that has trouble with other corkscrews!
4,good!!!,"the product was in excellent condition, new!!! but it got there with out the box. I bought it to give as a gift but without box it didnt workout. any way i kept it because its useful and charmy to have in my little bar at home"
1,great while it worked but...,We had used one of these on vacation and loved it. Bought one when we got home and after 6 months it started making very loud clicking noises as soon as it hit the cork. Now it won't even pull the cork out. Any suggestions on recycling as it is useless to us now and seems quite a waste.
1,Works great until it breaks,"Bought two of these for Christmas, one to use and one to give as a gift later in the year. Began using right after Christmas. It was fantastic, worked just as advertised and shown in the video. In February it stopped working. It acts like the retracting mechanism broke. I began trying to get warrenty service from Oster. No luck.In the meantime I began using the second one. It was fantastic until it broke two weeks later. Same problem. Now I have two broken openers. I guess I will go back to a cork screw, primative but effective.I guess this post brought good karma. Got an email today notifying me that a replacement was being shipped. Will report how this one goes."
1,Electric Wine Bottle Opener,This does not work for me at all. Either I am buying the wrong kind of wine bottles or this product is ineffective. It pulls the cork out about half way and then I have to use a different method to remove it the rest of the way. The only good feature I have found about it is the foil cutter. It works very well. I wish the Opener worked half as well.
2,Battery is useless after 2 years,It was a great opener when the battery was strong... 20+ corks per charge. Now after 2 years the battery is pretty useless and will only cork 1-2 bottles per charge. A 2 year product is not enough.
5,Electric wine bottle opener,"After searching the reviews to find an electric opener that worked, This is the one that kept coming up as recommended. This opener is easy to use, fast, efficient and appears to be made very well. I would definitely recommend this opener for the $20 it costs."
5,Works great,One of the best things I've bought. Works great and fast. Nice sleek design. No mess with the cork. Recommended
2,Not impressed,"This was ok in theory, but I don't like that the cork is hard to remove from the machine. Not impressed. Wouldn't recommend it."
1,Never really worked well,"Save your money. This product does not work well and is a little difficult to use. In the end, i had to use a regular wine bottle opener."
5,perfect Christmas present,I bought 3 D's 1 for each member of my family and they love them is the new favorite item in the kitchen
3,It's okay,It does work pretty well on all types of corks but very tricky to use. I got frustrated with it and ended up getting rid of it because it was easier to open bottles manually.
3,Almost Good,"Great wine opener for standard wine bottles with 'cork' corks. It struggles a little bit with synthetic corks and doesn't work at all with wine bottles with the wide flange top. HOWEVER, it's still worth the $$$."
4,Electric Wine Opener,I love this electric wine opener. It's easy to use and makes opening a bottle of wine very easy. I don't have to struggle with opening the bottle.
5,Oster Electric Wine Opener,Best thing since sliced bread!!!! I love it and have bought some for gifts. Everyone has loved the gifts and are amazed at the ease of using the opener.
4,Not perfect but nice,"I tried to use this once and I can't say it's infallible, but the design and idea are quite nice."
4,you will be haevy drinker!,It is totally easy so it makes my husband not hesitate to open the wine!There is a little defect of this product what is big can not store in drawer.
5,Oster Wine Opener,The Oster Electric Wine Opener does a superb job at making open wine bottles a breeze. I have not found a wine bottle that fits in the opening it will not open. I highly recommend this item.
2,Really noisy!,"This product sounds like a drill when you use it. I would never use it in front of guests, and I fear it would wake our children if we used it after hours."
2,forgot,you forgot to include my name and the recipient did not know who sent the item.....please send my money back or send a letter of apology to the recipient
1,Oster 4207 Electric Wine Opener,I bought this electric cork remover as a gift for my husband. He loves it. My son came to visit and thought it was great. So I ordered another for him. Cork removal has never been this easy before. Our wine bottles had synthetic corks and it did the job quickly and easier. Thank you Oster and Amazon. Shirley Dillon
1,how lazy can you be?,"My husband bought this item for me without my permission. One of the simple pleasures I look forward to in life is opening a bottle of wine with an old fashioned corkscrew. Well, not anymore. My husband loves to buy anything with a plug even if it is not necessary and this product is a perfect example of that. This is sort of like if you need to read a book should you buy a laptop and download the book and read it piece by piece, plugging in the computer as you go or should you you just go ahead and READ THE BOOK BY ITSELF? The answer is simple, my friend. Do not graduate to this type of party. Just stick to the old fashioned corkscrew it is not that hard depending upon how many bottles of wine you plan to drink every night."
5,Great Little Wine Opener!,"I already had one of these wine openers for myself and absolutely loved it. This one was purchased as a gift & sent directly to my friend. She loves it too. What's not to like? Charge it up & it will open about 30 bottles by simply pushing a button. Nice price too, in stores it goes for $30."
4,awesome gift,great gift and it works perfect. Very easy to use and impresses all our friends. You need to be carful to hold it straight though otherwise it drills down at an angle and can break the cork.
5,easiest opener ever,love ours and have bought several as gifts. receive nothing but raves about it. i have an extra just in case i need a gift in a hurry.
4,handy gadget to have,"I ordered this after using my sister-in-law's. I like it a lot. Small, rechargeable, gets the job done. Comes with a foil cutter. Just cut the foil, put the opener on top and hold the button - voila! It's open. Press reverse to spit the cork out in your hand.I've used it on quite a few bottles - both cork and plastic corks - never had a problem."
5,Love this opener!,"My parents have used this for a while and bought me one for Christmas. At first I never thought I'd use it, but we love this thing!!It's a bit large, but easily ""hidden"" behind the coffee maker. We've opened A LOT of bottles with this and works flawlessly. It's a bit noisy but really not a big deal.I did see a few other reviews saying they couldn't get it to work but it's probably because they weren't doing it correctly - you just have to push the button in ONE direction until the cork is fully extracted, and you only push in the 'reverse' direction to extract the cork from the opener."
1,Cork remove button broke after 8 months,"The product is super easy to use but after 8 mons the plastic up down button broke, so having to buy a new one. I'll try a different brand. I had an oyster before this one that also broke."
2,Not happy,It only brings up the cork half way. I am not happy with it. I still have to pull the cork out with something else.
5,Open your eyes to this gem!,"Oster wine opener is fantastic! Friend recommended it to us - we've recommended to everyone we know. This is an easy to use opener. If someone's having problems with it, they didn't read the directions and are trying to do the work instead of letting the opener do the work. This is a no muss, no strain product! Great for everyone!!"
1,Synthetic Cork,"The opener worked on normal cork on a bottle of good beer. The cork was already half way out of the bottle, so I think it made it a lot easier, but when I used it on a synthetic cork on a bottle of wine all the way in the neck of the bottle, it woudln't go in straight. After I got the synthetic cork out, I found it pushed to the side. The cork wasn't even on the screw. It had pushed the screw aside and ripped one of the wires out. The screw is not very sturdy or secure. I'm going to go back to a traditonal man-powered win opener. Good ole' steel is better than whaterever connects the screw to the motor in this thing."
5,AMAZING Wine Opener!!,"This wine opener is AMAZING! I used to get so frustrated with all of the different wine openers. Either I didn't have the strength to pull the cork out, or it'd end up in pieces in the wine. This thing is flawless everytime! I love it!! For the price, you can't beat it with a stick!"
5,"works great, inexpensive, kinda cool looking",Great for people with weak hands who otherwise have trouble with most other wine openers!
1,ozeri not oster,"I realized we got an Ozeri wine opener, not an Oster. Apologize for the error. As for the Ozeri wine opener, the rest of this review stands: We have not been able to open even one bottle of wine with this useless wine opener! Beware - don't buy this!"
3,Big Price Increase?!?,"Based on all the great reviews I bought several of these as gifts for $23.99. Now I've come back and it's $49.99!!!Too bad, because it made a great gift that was really appreciated."
1,Broke Third time used,These Oster Electric Wine bottle openers are garbage. I bought several for Christmas gifts and the one I kept for myself stop working after the third bottle I opened.
4,looks so elegant....,love the look... so elegant on the counter... have not really used it yet... but i hope it does its work? oster seems to be a good brand so it will be a disappointment if this does not meet my expectations....
1,Oster wine bottle opener,Extremely disappointed in this product. It is only made for small bottles of wine. Will not open the larger bottles.
4,Very nice product,This wine opener is very nice. Looks great in the kitchen. I've used this product twice so far... the second time i used it the cork got stuck around the spiral metal piece inside and i was totally upset! I tried my best to get it out but was unsuccessful. i tried opening another bottle even with the other cork still lodged in and it was a no go. So i got a knife and had to cut and chop the cork to pieces until it finally came completely out lol. Hopefully that will be the last and only problem with this open. It's a very durable product because my cutting and chopping was a little on the aggressive side and it's still works :) Overall i love the product and would definitely recommend it ;)
2,Too difficult,You need muscles to use this right. You must hold the bottle with one hand SECURELY while holding the opener with the other hand and forget about getting the cork out if you can't hold everything straight up and down.
1,Waste of time,"The only good thing about this bottle opener is that I received a full refund once it was returned. It should have come with a warning stating how badly your cork would get torn up while trying to use the opener. Thought it was just me, so I let several people try my new opener. Everyone else had the same problem. Save your time and money."
5,Great product,"Love this wine opener! It has this sleek stand and look to it, it goes very well in my kitchen. I only bought this out of curiosity (if this actually works) and because of the price I figured I couldn't go wrong. At first, I wasn't quite sure that this would push through with its usage. But when I started opening bottles of wine with this amazing wine opener, I was astonished that it actually delivers quality work. Almost no effort is required because this opener does all the work for you. its pretty cool"
5,IT REALLY WORKS!!,HI! This is a wonderful wine opener! My wife and I have used one like this for over a year and been amazed! The hard to get out corks come out with ease!!! Buy It you won't be disappointed!
5,Best Wine Opener ever.,Over the years I have bought every type of wine opener made. From rabbit type to bar mounted to pump up to air pressure w/ CO2 cartridges. This simple inexpensive battery operated wine opener surpasses them all.Why wife who has some arthritis in her hands can now easily open a bottle of wine.I think it is so popular they keep running out of stock on this item.
1,Gorgeous but hugely disappointing...,"I LOVE the looks of this item, and I was honored to have it on my counter... UNTIL it broke. And, I have been through two of them that broke in fairly short time. Sadly, another chapter in the ""all show and little go"" novella. I had bought an extra thinking it was a great, moderately priced gift for another food and wine lover--but the first one ceased functioning so quickly that I had to use the backup ""gift"" extra just for my own use. In rather quick time it stopped working and actually broke a chunk out of the glass neck of a bottle of wine making it risky to even drink it. Ever mindful of not wanting to waste wine, I carefully decanted what was left through cheesecloth into another bottle, but the experience was ruined worrying about little glass shards. Beautiful, yes-on a caliber of looking as if it should be in the Museum of Modern Art. Reliable? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Keep a backup to really work for you if I get it. A huge disappointment."
1,Motor Burnt Out in 45 days,"I was drawn to all the reviews, however buyer beware. The motor burnt out in literally 45 days.The quality is truly disappointing."
1,Oster Electric Wine Opener,"This is a horrible product. Received the item, charged it and it didn't work correctly. The wine opener will take the cork out, just can't get the cork out of the opener then... I really liked the red color but I suppose it's just too cheap to work correctly!"
5,Oster 4207 Botttle Opener,This bottle opener is the best ever. It works exactly as adverised and makes cork pulling fun and not work.
3,Bought this for my 90 year old father,"I Bought this for my 90 year old father when I moved him into an assisted living complex. But it was too difficult for him and his friends to use.You have to hold on to the bottle as it's unscrewing your cork.I found it a blessing to use, but not easy and very noisy. My guests loved it.Unfortunately it completely died after two years of lots of use, but inexcusable nonetheless."
3,works with cork only,this doesn't work if you're trying to open a wine bottle that has a plastic or rubber cork. it works only with real cork and a lot of vinyards are now botteling with other than real cork.
1,Was Great until it Broke,Thought this baby was the best thing since sliced bread but it didn't even last a full 30 days and for $20.00 it's not even worth the effort to pack it up to return it. I will look for another brand.
1,Poor Quality - broken in less than 1 year,I purchased this item after seeing a very favorable comment in Wine Spectator. Definately a neat toy but after less than 10 months of occasional use the switch broke. Sunbeam will not service the unit directly and requires you to go to a service center (in my case half a state away - Sunbeam should offer to pay for shipping). Considering the cost of the product not worth it to repair and not willing to replace given the poor reliability
4,"Works well,,,But","This is a great idea and works well with both cork and those synthetic stoppers.....But,,,the battery is very weak and will open only one bottle at time before it needs to be recharged.....You have to recharge it after opening every bottle.....I was going to buy these for presents,,but decided not to because of the hassle of the frequent recharging...If you only need to open 1 bottle at a time and can wait several hours until the battery recharges then buy this item...."
5,"Great product, but don't use on a plastic cork.","I love this product. It makes it effortless to open a wine bottle. The first one lasted about 4 years until one bottle I used it on had a plastic cork. The cork twisted in too far, above the corkscrew. It would not come out. It is still in there. I tried prying it out, but there isn't enough space. If anyone has had this similar experience and got the stuck cork out, I would love to know how they did it. So I ordered a new opener. I will make sure I don't use it on a plastic cork."
3,Works half the time,"We had one of these for several years and it worked fine. But then it made funny grinding noises and then quit. So, I looked around locally to find a replacement but couldn't, so I went to Amazon and found the same one we had. This had gotten good reviews in several places so I ordered it. Since it arrived it has worked maybe half the time. You push the button and - nothing. Fiddle with it a little and it works. It's not worth the effort and postage to send it back, but I would certainly consider a different brand next time (which could be soon)."
2,Never worked properly,This product was a big disappointment. It broke after about the third use. Wish I could have returned it before the return window expired!
3,Initial enthusiasm with subsequent disappointment,"We have purchased several (over a dozen) Oster wine openers as gifts, especially for celebratory events (weddings/birthdays etc.) All recipients were very pleased. While we haven't heard anything negative from them, our personal purchase has lasted just over a year when the battery finally gave out & will not re-charge the unit. Prior to this it had a most difficult time extracting the newer plastic, rather than cork-topped wine bottles. We're disappointed and probably will not re-order."
3,Great *when* it works,"We were so excited to buy this and thought it would make Wine Opening easier. The product overall works well and is really neat. The problem I have is that sometimes you cannot get the cork up even though you feel like you are going to get it in just a few seconds. This is all depending on where you screw it in, and that is where the problem lies. You cannot completely see when its placed and it can be tricky.Once you use it a couple times, you get the trick and its easy."
1,broken after a month,"Got this product becuase It look neat, but is broken only after a month and we only used it a few times!"
2,Fault in wine opener,I used my friends wine opener and loves it so I bought one for myself. Unfortunately the experience has NOT been the same. Whenever I use mine the cork only comes out half way. Then I am stuck trying to get it out the rest of the way. Difficult.
1,Unsatisfied,"Purchased two of these, one for myself and one for a gift. Both did not work correctly. Pushing the button to twist the corkscrew into the cork appeard to work, then when pushing the button to remove the cork, it did not remove the cork, only raised it a little. Had to re-do the corkscrew, 3-4 more times and then had to physically pull the cork out of the bottle by hand when it raised enough. Same problem with the one given as a gift. Tried it several times, and different people doing it, in case it was operator error. Functionality not good for the price. I cannot use it, and would return it, but do not still have the paperwork."
3,"Bought two, one still works.","Well I bought two of these. After a month one of them broke, but six months down the road the other is still going strong."
2,"Ok, but there are better ones out there.","Doesn't extract the cork very far, the button is fragile (held on by rubber band now) and even after modifying it to pull an extra quarter inch, the girl still isn't comfortable using it.The one at Costco looked better for the same price."
1,Early failure,I bouoght this device a couple of years ago. It worked fine for a few weeks until an internal electrical failure sent it to the trash.
4,Like it!!,"I purchased the Oster 4207 a little over a month ago, I have used the opener at least 8-10 times and it works very well. I have the opener sitting on my counter so it is easy to get to and use."
5,Husband Loves It,"I bought this as a wedding present for a friend because my husband just loves the one I purchased for him a year ago. It has everything you need to open your wine bottles in a very compact space. First you use the paper cutter which nestles in the back of the holder to free the top wrapping and then place the device over the cork and push the down arrow to pierce the cork. You then push the up button and it pulls the cork out of the bottle in one smooth operation. The only thing you have to remember is to hold the bottle firmly during the opening and closing.It is nice looking sitting in its charging cradle, and we have never had a problem with it. If you drink wine, this is the best investment in an opener that I know (and the price is modest.)"
1,Great while it Lasted!,"I bought this along with the wine cooler.I loved the gadget immediately. It workedlike a charm. However, at just under thethree month mark, it ceased to function.I heard the screw whir, but it no longerremoved the cork. The charger no longerworked, either. Sadly, save your money!"
5,"So far, so good.","I bought this for myself and as Xmas gifts. I've not used it a lot yet, but so far it seems to do the job well."
2,Ouch!,"This product is good, but MAKE SURE its fully charged each time you use it!!The last time my fiance used it, it ran out of juice before getting the cork out.So he tugged and pulled and when he finally got it out, the bottle openersmashed him in the mouth and broke his tooth. We haven't touched it since."
2,Note quite worth it.,"It's not a bad purchase, but for an electric opener, isn't faster than the rabbit. If you like options, okay, but if you need to get to your wine quickly...invest in the rabbit."
2,Worked for a while then self-destructed,"We had one of these for a while, and it worked. Then one day, the internal mechanism that drives the corkscrewdisintegrated, and, while the motor still worked, the corkscrew no longer did. So it was permanently dead. I giveit two star because it worked for a while and take the rest away because of cheap internal construction."
3,Nothing wrong with it.,"While there's nothing wrong with it, I find it is just another gadget that takes up space in a cabinet or on the counter. We do not use it all that often and probably would not buy another."
1,It works for 1 minute only :(,"Yes, it's not a joke. It works only for 1 minute. When I unpacked it, I try to use it. It worked. Then I try to charge it and put it on stand. And nothin happened. I think a red light should appear. But there is no light and tool still is not working for now.I'm completely unsatisfied with the quality of this product and will not recommend it to everyone. Also I'm not from US and I can't return this defect tool back.I don't know how to attach photoes, so just a link to photo proof [...]"
5,Great gift product...everyone loves it!,"I happened to see this product on TV advertised as a great Christmas item for any wine drinker. It lookedgreat but I couldn't find any locally. When I went on line and found it at Amazon I was elated plus with theovernight shipping it was the easiest purchase of all. The best is that I am still hearing raves about it frommen and women alike! Maybe I will stock up for ""just in case"" gifts....whatever."
2,Update after using for a while...,"I love this! It just sits on the counter, ready to go, and is the easiest corkscrew I have ever used. Comes with a great foil cutter, and cork pulling couldn't be easier. Press a button and it's out, press again and the cork is released. You have to have a good grip on the bottle when pulling the cork, but definitely does not need any great strength to handle. I would recommend this item to anyone!This thing worked great for about a year. Then it started getting the cork stuck on it, especially the plastic corks. I had a heck of a time getting the stuck cork out of the gadget. After this happened several times, I stopped using it and went back to a manual corkscrew. Too bad, it was nice while it lasted."
4,Not bad at all,"didn't know what to expect from a cordless wine opener, but i was pleasantly surprised by this one....works pretty well and pulls the cork out for you, just as advertised....the motor sounds a little weak so i don't know how long it will last but so far, so good..."
2,A Limited Cork Puller,"This battery-operated cork puller is a whiz for fast, effortless cork pulling, but only with natural corks. Multiple attempts with plastic ""corks"" didn't work. The screw would not penetrate the dense, platic material."
4,95% of the time - great!,"I didn't have high expectations for this opener - didn't think it would replace my Rabbit - but it did!For about 95% of the bottles opened, it does a great job. Fast & easy.A very small percentage of the time, you will find a little cork residue, but it's been very rare for me.The only real problem I've encountered has been with older, crumbling corks. The torque from this opener shreds them as the screw mechanism is fast & powerful. (Because of this it does a great job on synthetic corks.)"
4,corks up,"Great product. Sure saves time and energy. People that see us use it are impressed. So far has worked on all corks, real and synthetic."
5,Perfect gift,We purchased this item for our anual Christmas gift exchange. A number of invited guests had admired it at previous functions so it was a big hit.
3,wine opener,You have to read instructions. Finally got it to work but the plug in the wine bottle dod not come out.
1,Short-lived love affair,"Loved it for the first two months, used it frequently. Even in its dormant state it was a great conversation starter. Then it stopped working; it would screw all the way down into the cork and then halt. I let the battery drain, charged it fully and tried again. Same problem. I tossed it because for $20 I was not willing to navigate customer service, package the item, stand in line at USPS and ship it back. So I cut my losses. Total waste of money unless you're looking for a not particularly attractive countertop sculpture."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a review of my SECOND Oster Electric Wine Bottle Opener. I ordered it when the first one died after about 6 months. After leaving this one charging overnight, I attampted to use it. It never seemed as if had enough charge. The motor sounds very labored and slow. It never occurred to me that the item would be lousy, and I threw out the box and packaging as soon as I connected it. That was a mistake. Otherwise I would have returned it. So, I have ordered a more durable (albeit more expensive) model from another company and it works fine. If you absolutely MUST buy this one, at least save the box because you will definitely end up returning it."
5,Great with normal corks,"The Wine Bottle Opener is an excellent product. It works great. I only had a problem. Try opening a bottle of Portuguese wine called Mateus. The cork of this bottle is smaller than normal. At the time of uncork, the cork was trapped in the bottom of the Wine Bottle Opener. LOL! I had to carve the cork with scissors and activate the reverse of the Wine Bottle Opener to pull the cork. So be careful when opening bottles with corks smaller than normal.Here a picture of the bottle: [...]. Note that the bottle neck is thinner than normal ... thats why the cork is smaller than normal."
1,Poor quality,"This thing is worthless!! Whoever wrote the reviews, that I based my purchase on, are clearly mistaken about the product. It will not stay charged no matter how long, days, weeks, on the charger! Rediculous waste of my money and worthless reviews and information!!! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
2,Another throw away,This product worked fine for about 12 to 18 months----now it no longer holds charge and we must add it to the landfills. I think it is designed to croak in a short time frame so you can replace it (since it is inexpensive) Not what you call environmentally friendly. Would not buy another one because of its short life.
5,Auto Wine Opener is a BIG PLUS ++++,"I love this product! Not that opening a wine bottle by any means is difficult and needs to be improved, but this makes it more impressive, especially in front of company and those you wish to impress. Or if you have a hand injury (carpel tunnel) and can't quite squeeze the bottle or opener as necessary to remove the cork. This clever gadget does all the work for you, including spitting the cork back out in your hand when you are done. My sister was so delighted with it I had to buy one for her to be awaiting her return when she got home from her visit with me."
5,Oster wine opener,A friend had one so I just had to get this after using his. It works well. The product was delivered quickly and as deascribed.
4,A must have for lazy wine lovers,"We purchase two of these a couple of years ago and they worked perfectly until recently when one of them died. I took it apart and a wire had come lose. That is not good workmanship and is the reason I downgraded the rating from 5*. We have since repurchased a replacement with the special low price at Amazon and two more for gifts for friends.It is rechargeable and works in seconds on virtually any type of wine bottle, even through the foil!Why struggle with traditional corkscrews when this is so reasonably priced?"
2,Plastic corks,"This opener would not successfully open a bottle with a synthetic stopper (plastic?), a trend in affordable wine that seems to be increasing. The instructions state that another type opener should be used. Also, the red light on top unnecessarily draws attention to the opener on the countertop."
1,Stopped working after 4 months of use,"This worked great at first, but after 4 months it's stopped working. Now it just chews up the cork, splits it in half, and won't extract. Turns out the cork screw is loose inside the unit, but after taking it apart, we realized it's not possible to fix. I would not recommend this item."
4,Electric Wine Opener,Works just as advertised. Makes getting corks out just a snap. Couldn't be more pleased.
2,Occasional opener,I have only used this unit a couple of times and on both occasions it only pulled the cork out half way even trying twice; I had to go back to my mechanical one to get it the rest of the way out. I volunteer at wine tasting events on occasion and thougth it might be a show-off tool but I think not in this case. The metal cutter works great and will be in my pocket for sure.
5,Better than I expected!,"This product makes opening a bottle of wine effortless. Any wine drinker with Arthritis or Carpal tunnel (like me) should own this. You do need one hand on the bottle and one on the opener to keep them from rotating, then just hold the rocker switch down. It has a sleek look and fits in on your bar or counter. A great gift!"
2,Great but leaves cork residue in wine,We love the wine opener but it always leaves cork residue in the wine bottle. It is because the cork screw goes completely through the cork and then pieces of the cork fall into the wine. It needs a re-design so that the cork screw stops just short of the end of the cork.Looking for a new one.
5,Best gadget ever,"My husband and I were having such a time opening wine due to arthritis. I saw this and decided to give it a try. It is EXCELLENT! We have not had one bottle that didn't open perfectly and with ease. I was so thrilled, that I bought one for my son. Now he is a real gadget lover person so I thought he might enjoy it too. He is always appreciative when having received a gift but isn't a person who gets effusive. This opener broke that mode. He was thrilled and said that he gets almost giddy when he opens a new bottle of wine. He couldn't rave enough of how well it works, how easy it works and what fun it is to have. We all highly recommend it."
2,Disposable,Worked great for 2 weeks. Plastic corks got stuck and would not eject. Item ended up burning out after 3 weeks and needed to be discarded. Would not recommend at all.
2,Should have read the fine print,"This might work as advertised on ""cork"" corks. They do tell you that it may not work on ""plastic"" corks.It doesn't at all. Today most bottles of wine $10-$15 seem to have the non-cork cork. So unless you drink 1st tier wine it is useless. If you can afford 1st tier, let the butler open the bottles."
5,Great gift idea,"I bought my first one of the these as a gift for my sister for Christmas in 2010. She raved about it so much, my wife added it to her list (and got one) and we made it our ""gift of the year"" for this past Christmas. We bought about 4 or 5 of them for some of our close family.I've always struggled to find an easy quality wine opener. I like the restaurant style ones, but they aren't for everyone. We have one of those table top monstrosities with the handle and suction cups on the bottom and although they work ok, they are huge.The Oster is SO easy to use. Put it on top of the bottle, hold the button in the down position until it stops (the cork is now removed), then hold the button in the up position until the cork falls out.We just got together with some family recently and got 2 more rave reviews about this opener.Highly recommended for function and value."
2,Worked Good----About 4 times,"I have had this a few months and have only used it about 4 times.It will not charge, or work in any manner. Going to see what canbe done about replacing it. I liked it......while it worked. I havefriends who own these and have not had problems so hope I just got a""lemon"".Checked, it is outside the ""return date"". Very disappointed. If I buy anotherit might be local and not from Amazon....so I can return local if it breaks......"
1,Didn't work,Broke first time I used it. Maybe I didn't know what I was doing. the button flew off. that was that.Penguin Brushed Stainless EZ Pull Wine Opener - Easiest Wine Opener EverI am so much happier with this. Very Very easy! And doesn't have to be recharged.
1,Not Satisfied!,I've had this product for a year now and I haven't used it much because it's so frustrating to use. I always have to repeat the process because the cork does not come out the first time. You need lessons on the proper way to use it I guess. It's not worth the money! You're better off with the good 'ol cork screw!! It's more reliable!
1,Big disappointment,"I bought one as a gift and after reading reviews and video, I decided to get one myself. I tried it out before wrapping for my friend - it was horrible, didn't work and a real waste so I didn't gift it and will return both"
5,Very Nice,"Very nice, we enjoyed opening the wine with our new product. This is very user friendly! i would recommend the product to every wine drinker."
5,Effortless wine bottle opener,"The Oster FPSTBW8207-S Electric Wine Bottle Opener, Silver, is a nice looking and easy-to-use wine bottle opener that will get the job done in about 10 seconds or less. Highly recommended."
5,Love It!,"This is an overall amazing product! It features a simple, yet sleek design with its metallic color paired with black base and light on top. I got this product for my own use and as a gift, and it works like a charm. Both the foil opener and the actual product work great and it is quick. I believe that this is the best product for such a great price!"
5,Can't live without it!,"This, by far, is THE best wine bottle opener I've ever purchased. I have purchased this for myself and a second one as a gift. It's very simple to use, works well, is well-made, and looks attractive on my kitchen counter. I highly recommend this product."
2,Good start -- Bad finish,"When we first received the Oster Wine Opener 4207, we used it weekly or more often and it worked well. But after about one year, the battery would not recharge. And the battery is not replaceable.I would not recommend this product based on it's battery life."
4,Clumsy operation,"The power corkscrew enters the cork effectively, but it takes a thigh grip of the bottle to pull the cork out. The the power cork release is smooth, but that does not compensate for the awkward effort reqauired to pull the cork."
5,The greatest!,"When I opened the package, I was able to open a bottle of wine immediately. I thought I was going to have to charge it up for a while. This baby yanks the corks right out of the bottle, and spits it right back out in your hand. Great product. Can't go wrong with Oster."
3,Impressive but not for long!,"I am an avid wine enthusiast. I've owned many wine opening gadgets. At first I was very excited about my oster. All my friends and family were very impressed. After three months of continued use the wire coil broke off. This being said, I did enjoy it while it lasted. I do recommend that it be used for special occassions if you would like to enjoy for a long while."
3,failed then replaced,"Purchased this and used it for a couple of months and had cork bits in my drinks and then it simply lost power. Appears to have over torqued the motor on the non cork materials and wiped out the motor. No practical option with Oster for return or repair so it becomes landfill material. Ugh.Well I complained on the Oster website, gave my email and home address, and Bingo they are mailing me a new one directly from Jarden Consumer Solutions (the parent company). If they are willing to stand by their product at this level, then I am willing to bump up the rating a bit."
2,Stopped working w/in two weeks!,"This product stopped reversing, after only two weeks of light use and therefore made it impossible to use...VERY disappointing!I expected more from Oster."
1,Melted!,When I first gt this I was realy impressed. Worked great everytime with never a split cork. About the third time I went to charge it the casing melted near the top! Now I am afraid to plug it in lest it cause a fire or something. I am going back to the rabbit type. Don't buy this product!
3,Somewhat Delicate,I am on my second one. First one lasted six months. Opener does not like plastic corks. Ok for what you pay for it.
3,electric wine opener,"I have owned 5 of them, they work great for a while...then break, so I have gone back to the manual ones"
2,"Great product, doesn't last long!",I purchased this almost 1 year ago and I loved it when we first got it. Worked like a charm and a very nice conversation piece too! Glad I waited to review this because it's already died and will no longer hold a charge! Thank goodness I didn't pay a lot for it! But I feel like I still through away $20!!! I would not recommend unless you want to purchase a new one every few months!
1,"After a few months, throw it away","Once the teflon on the built-in corkscrew wears out, it shreds corks. Apparently there is no way to replace the teflon-coated corkscrew. Oster provides no instructions or any means to replace this part. On manual wine openers, this part is replaceable. On the Oster it is not. I guess the only option is to toss it away, eat the cost and return to your manual cork puller. It was great while it lasted, which isn't long if you drink wine every night as I do."
4,wine opener,"It is just what was ordered was a replacement for a christmas gift that broke first time out of the box, as described, shipped fast thanks..........P.S. has plenty of opening power...."
4,Wine Lover,"Much better than the Brookstone model it replaces! Stand could be a little heavier, as it wiggles a lot when replacing the unit for recharge, but a great deal overall."
2,Nice - but doesn't last,"I've bought two of these - both died after a few months of reasonable use (estimate 10 - 12 uses for each one). As far as ease and speed of use, I think the Oster is a big improvement over waiter and twist corkscrews but not any better overall than a good rabbit-style manual opener. If you already have a good rabbit-style manual opener, I don't think you're going to benefit much from buying one of these unless you like having electric devices cluttering your kitchen countertop (or wet bar)."
1,Two strikes - You're Out,"I have purchased this item twice. It has broken twice. The first time I bought it at Walmart and they gave me a refund. I re-ordered through Amazon and not 60 days after purchase, the second one broke. I have not bothered to return or request a refund because I don't want to hassle with the shipping, packaging, etc. However, I have returned to the manual openers and will not try this item again. I loved the way it worked, when it worked, but it has a very short life. Recommend that you save your money."
5,Fastest way to remove a cork from a bottle,"The Oster 4207 Electric Wine Opener is a must for anyone with a wine collection or those who drink wine on a regular basis. The simplicity of this product is unmatched by other wine openers; if you can press and hold a button, you can open a wine bottle."
4,WINE OPENER Electric Cordless,"This is a simple, easy to use product. Makes opening a bottle of wine a very quick and effortless task."
2,Life expectancy too short,"I enjoyed this wine opener while it lasted. Despite constant charge and really taking good care of it, after 12 months of use it decided to expire on me and there is nothing I can do to make it work. I am going back to manual wine openers."
5,Works Perfectly,We have used this product for over a year. We open at least two bottles a week and have not had any problems. This even works well with plastic corks.
5,The best thing that has happened to wine since the wine glass!,"I love this wine opener. I have used this brand for 5 years. No longer do I struggle with corks. This easy to use opener always removes the cork without cracking it or pushing it into the bottle. Simply hold the down area of the button and the corkscrew pushes into the cork and then automatically raises up, bringing the cork with it. To release the cork simply hold down the up portion of the button. I now give this electric opener as gifts. Friends are fascinated when they see it, and delighted as they use it. It has been the conversation piece of many parties!"
1,Electric Wine-Bottle Opener,Very diappointed. Worked great the first time and progressively got worse until it broke on the third bottle of wine!
1,Broken cork screws Oster opener,"I purchased an Oster Wine Opener about a year ago. Everything was fine until a cork broke apart inside the workings and I could not remove it. It would not work afterwards, and I could not remove the broken pieces. I removed the screws and took out the broken cork, but without any help or diagram of course there was a risk I could not reassemble it just right springs, etc. with no obvious mounting points). It's history now. I'll try another brand."
1,Oster 4207 Electric Wine Opener,"After using a similar wine opener at a relative's home, I thought that this would be the solution for my difficulty (old, weak hands) with most wine openers. I was greatly disappointed when, after only a few successful uses, the contact, normally used to recharge the battery, pulled loose, putting it in the way of the opening for a bottle. I was further disappointed when I could find nothing about a guarantee on the box or on papers shipped with the opener. The wine opener was so new that all that stuff was still at hand."
3,Broke after about three months,"You have to be careful with these units. I basically broke mine by holding down the button too long. The cork basically went all the way up into the unit and I couldn't reverse it out. Probably my own fault, which is why I am giving three stars vs. one."
1,Do Not Buy!,"The corkscrew cannot be properly aligned to stay true to the center. So, as it goes down, the corkscrew grinds into the bottle undoubtedly creating fine glass chips. After repeated attempts, the cork comes out looking like Swiss cheese with the wine probably containing a spray of fine glass particles.As stated above, do not buy this device."
2,not what iexpeced,i thought the product did not perform as i thought it would.hard to pull cork out of bottle.going to ask for my money back.Floyd gig harbor
2,Cheaply Made,I had high hopes for this product and it worked well for about a week. It then froze up and would not move. Luckily I got it at Costco so I returned it and not another only to find the same result. Just didn't have a solid feel from the beginning and didn't last long. I would rather pay twice as much for a quality one. I was surprised as Oster normally makes quality stuff.
2,Return opener,"This is a very sleek looking wine opener, but not so easy to use. We finally returned the opener."
2,Good While It Lasted,"Worked perfectly for the first dozen bottles or so, then the cork screw broke out of the unit renedereing it useless. Disappointing."
1,Worked for 30 days than broke.,Worked great for about a month and then it broke. The screw pull just broke off. It must be defective.
1,Useless,Did not remove any type of wine cork. A corkscrew does a much better and faster job. Totally not work the money.
1,Oster Electric Wine-Bottle Opener,The Oster Wine Opener is simply a piece of junk. It could not pull the top off a baby bottlelet alone remove a cork from a wine bottle. It simply does not work. I bought the device formy wife who as she ages is having more and more difficulty removing the newer synthetic corksfrom wine bottles. THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE SOLUTION... NOT it just does not do what itis intended to do.
5,Oster electic cork puller,This neat machine is quick and easy. After pulling the cork from the bottle it ejects the cork into your hand. Easy to store. I have not had one problem with it. not even on the tough plastic corks or on older corks.
2,If you want to add quantity and not quality,"to your movie collection, then by all means buy this. If you are expecting a polished product you will be dissapointed. I really like Angelle Brooks, but this wasn't her finest performance. James Black delivered the strongest performance of the film. The script left a lot to be desired, but for a first time effort I guess it wasn't as bad as it could have been.I found the movie to be a notch above a film school project, but it was a welcome break from the gangsta, pimp/ho, court jester ... that seems to permeate films by or about African-Americans. Hav Plenty is a better film in all aspects and funny to boot!"
5,scanner,For the money this is the best scanner I have ever purchased..It is very accurate in it's readings and where it shows where a stud is then you can depend on it being their. With this scanner there is no more knocking on walls with a hammer to find a stud and also driving small holes in your wall to finda stud.very accurate
3,stud finder,"Where it works, it works very well. But one of my walls has a metallized mylar wall paper. and it doesn't seem to be able to read through that: therefore 3 stars."
4,Could have used a little something,"I bought this one for a course. It is the only translation at this time of King Rother in English. I have not compared the translation with the original Middle High German but it has been translated into rhyming couplets which must be its original form. One hundred and seven pages of rhyming couplets gets a bit wearisome at times and I think some footnotes, a glossary or an essay or two on the text would have filled out this volume nicely. If you are looking at this review at all, you are probably not someone looking casually for Medieval texts to read for fun. It is a little known piece of work, that draws in a bit of the Dietrichs epics and tries to invent a great pedigree for Charlemagne. It is not called an epic but a 'bridal quest' story. Some parts remind me of the Iliad which is the ultimate 'woman-stealing' story."
5,The best food processor ever,"Cuisinart invented the food processor and this model is about as good as it gets:) A lot of thought went into this model and it shows. The dual sized mouth is a great idea. I've used it to make bread, cookies, truffles and prepare other ingredients for use in a lot of different receipts. The over all quality is self evident. It's very fast, and easy to use and clean up. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,Love it!,"I bought this machine (in white) a week ago, and I have used it every day since then. I just love it. The machine works so effortless, quick, and elegant. It's such a joy to use it. The blade is super sharp and chops and blends everything very nicely. The two discs that come with it are heavy duty quality and work great. I love the extra large feeding tube. I haven't used the dough blade, so I can't say anything about that. Besides making food preparation fun, the machine also looks very nice and doesn't take up a lot of counter space. All the parts clean up quickly under warm running water. I am so pleased with this machine. I went to the store with the firm resolution to buy the Kitchenaid food processor, but I changed my mind when I compared it to the Cuisinart. I think this machine will serve me well in the years to come."
5,Can't Believe I Waited So Long to Get One!,"Just bought this processor last week and I'm already in love with it. Since I've never owned a processor before, I really didn't understand the impact it would have on our lives. There are so many foods that we love, but didn't have often because of the time and work they required. That's changing already. This machine is SIMPLE to use, even for a processor novice. It's EASY to clean and doesn't require a great deal of counter space. Absolutely the best gift I've ever purchased for myself."
3,Disappointment,"I purchased this item brnd new based upon Cuisinart reputation. When I took it out of box it did not work. I called Cuisinart and the employee told me to perform a small test. The machine still did not work and I was instructed to ship back under warranty. It cost me an addyional [amount of money] for shipping plus I had to wait a month to get it back. My advice, make sure it runs before buying. They need better quality control and should not make customer pay shipping because a new product was defective. Unfortunately, this experience has caused me to realize that you cannot purchase relying on Cuisinart reputation anymore."
4,New to me,"This is my first food processor, I wanted a good one so I would not judge the usefulness on a cheapie. This machine has worked very well. For some small jobs I will prefer my knives. but I compare it to a microwave, (yes I remember when they were new), some things I wouldn't want to do without it."
2,long term use limited,"This product was great in the beginning. However, over 2 years it has fallen apart. The plastic parts have come apart. I am forced to reassemble each time and hold it ""just so' for it to work. Replacing the plastic lid...well over $100. Also, the button covers have eroded. I'm trying Kitchen Aid next time. P.S. All pieces were hand washed; never in a dishwasher."
1,Why 1 star?,"As many people have already said, we cannot recommendthis product for the purpose of kneading dough.When we used it for kneading dough (we werefollowing the recipe in the Cuisinart instruction bookand hence used the right amount of dough), it startedto produce strong burning/electrical smell fromthe motor section and the smell did not disappearfor 10 min or so...Therefore, we sent it back to the customer serviceand asked them for a full refund. Actually, this wasthe SECOND time that we sent back their food processorfor the same reason. What was even worse, the waythe service representatives treat customers is reallydisgusting. ...We just wanted anyone interested in Cuisinart productsto know our bad experience with the customer service ..."
1,The unit leaks from the top and bottom,"I recently bought this unit to replace a trusty Cuisinart food processor that I used and loved for 30 years. Sadly, I discarded the old unit (the Lexan bowl had cracked) before fully testing the new unit. The first item I prepared was a small brioche dough. The unit leaked badly under the blade, and that part of the bowl was extremely difficult to clean. The next item I tried to prepare was a cold soup. I filled it to just under the marked fill line and water gushed out of the top when the liquid started to spin. I have just spoken with Cuisinart customer service. Both of these problems are normal with the unit. The maximum liquid that one can process is two cups! My small brioche dough was also too large. and it is normal for some dough to leak out under the blade. Needless to say, my old Cuisinart processor did not have either of these problems. This unit is fine for grating or slicing vegetables, or cheese, but not much else. Such a disappointment!"
4,Empire,"If you're not particularly concerned about historical accuracy, but don't want to stray to far off the mark, and want to avoid the flamboyant over design of Hollywood sets and costumes, this is a good choice for the Ancient Roman Empire enthusiast."
2,Décevant,"Beaucoup moins bon que Rome, les acteurs sont peu impressionnants et le récit très prévisible . On oublie vite cet Empire"
2,Twaddle,"EMPIRE is only interesting because it follows on from HBO's ROME but , really, its pretty poor compared to that and I CLAUDIUS. Plus lets see some Yanks in there - I am sick of the US using Brits as Romans and Greeks etc etc."
5,Brilliant Escapism,"Sometimes I like a movie or a book or a TV series that will absorb my attention on recurring viewings. The Lord Of The Rings is one of these books. Gladiator is one of these movies. And Empire is one of these TV series. It is absorbing, well acted and the sets are exactly as desired. It has a great story. Forget the exact historical facts, that is irrelevant to the enjoyment of this film. Simply sit back and sink into this other reality - it's a great trip.Ben"
3,Not a BAD movie,"I was happy watching this movie. The only weak actor in my opinion was Octavius. Unfortunately the movie revolves around that character. Still, by the end of this long movie I was glad I watched it."
2,bad but watchable,I was expecting a bit more historical truth. To have a gladiator responsible for the rise of Octavius to rule Rome was a bit ridiculous. Acting was so-so. Action was wanting. If you are into historical fiction and can let the facts that it is based on history but has very little else in common with it then you might like this movie. I would have thought that the telling of the true story would have been exciting without this melodrama.
5,empire,Excellent.first class service replaced faulty disc on request would recommend this seller to anyone with complete confidence
5,Funny story,This stuff worked all to well. I made the mistake of putting it just over my back tattoo in a nice big circle spent the whole day at the lake the next day I was a lobster but lo an behold my tattoo and the GIANT circle all around it was white as snow :/ Lesson learned but awesome buy and it did what it said it would !
2,Rock'n serve lids,"I am not at all happy with the square and rectangular lids, these lids become damaged in the corners. The others are excellent, the smallest one portion, and the round container."
1,Lids become damaged quickly,"I spent a fortune on these, loving the idea of being able to freeze then heat in the same container. That worked for a while, but with normal use EVERY top is damaged in the corners and will not fit on the containers. Definitely not the Tupperware standard! I would not purchase again."
1,Lids are VERY difficult to put on,"I love the see through, it is durable, hasn't stained, everything expect the lids are great. My husband and I have to put them upside down and bang on them in order for them to close on all sides. I know that if I was older they would just have to be given away. I asked the tupperware consultant about this last year and she said that it takes awhile for them to loosen up. Well it has ben 1-1/2 years later and no loosening!"
4,A7X meets Rob Zombie..,"This CD has the music of a heavier version of Avenged Sevenfold mixed with the voice and music of Rob Zombie, its like A7X and Rob Zombie had sex and had a baby, and Sanctity is it.This band has some of the best chugging riffs I have ever heard, my personal favorite being ""Beneath the Machine"".The music is awesome, the lyrics are great, this CD is worth every penny."
3,Not Bad,Not bad for a new ol' school slash metal band. For the likes of Shadowz Fall fanz i guess. I didnt really like the vocalz at first but it doez go with their sound i realized. Buy it if you like War Within by SF.
1,Total Ripoff,"I have never been so shocked at a purchase in my life. I just knew there was a mistake when I purchased this product for $79 to only receive one disk with 3 episodes on it. This is truly highway robbery. This is a gift that was specifically requested, however, I doubt the requester knew that only 3 episodes is on the disk. I am returning this gift."
1,Worst video set ever.,"This is the worst quality DVD set I have ever seen.Cheap packaging, very poor quality audio and video.Many episodes are literally unwatchable.Seriously, unbelievably, BAD.Total rip-off.DO NOT BUY."
4,Release the whole series,"This DVD was good but it could have been great. Why not follow the lead of Cheyenne and release the series. Commentary by James Garner would also add a classic touch. James Garner WAS Maverick. Jack Kelly was simply the ""brother."" Did anyone ever look better siting at a poker table than James Garner dressed in his Maverick garb? He was probably the finest tv actor of all time. Warner brothers has a gold mine in its Westerns and detective shows. Why not release 77 Sunset Strip with commentaries by all 3 leads while they are all still with us?"
4,"Great sampler set, but a full-season edition would be nice...","""Maverick"" was one of the best (and highly entertaining) westerns to hit the TV airwaves during the late 1950s. The three episodes represented here were among the best; ""Pappy"" with Troy Donahue and a pre-""Batman"" Adam West was standout.The folks at Warner Bros. did the right thing to showcase each episode exactly as it was originally broadcast, even down to the brief opening scene and fanfare (replete with the WB shield) that opened each '50s era show (deleted when TV Land aired the series a few years ago). My only disappointment is that there are no bonus features.I know that there are some die-hard purists out there among classic TV fans, and I join them in hoping that Warners will release full-season sets of this and other early hits in the near future!!"
1,only 3 episodes for the cost!,"This seems like you are getting a box set with a whole season... but its one disc with only 3 episodes. At over $10 per episode, this is a terrible deal. DO NOT BUY THIS DISC."
1,$45 for 3 episodes!!!!,I can not believe I spent $45 on this 1 disc dvd that only has 3 episodes on it!Talk about a rip off!Think about it before you buy this everyone.It's not worth it.
5,Three episodes only!,"It should be clearly noted that this is a 3 episode, one disc DVD release, featuring two episodes from Season Two and one episode from season Three. Neither of these three episodes have appeared on DVD before or since. The three episodes included are:Shady Deal At Sunny Acres 11/13/58 (Season 2)Gun Shy 1/11/59 (Season 2)Pappy 9/13/59 (Season 3)The DVD has been out of print for at least three years now. I enjoyed it and wish the studio would start releasing every season of ""Maverick"" on DVD. This is just a compilation of three favorite episodes only. Not enough to satisfy a hardcore Maverick fan like myself."
3,Good memories,"I bought this movie for a gift, but I watched it before to be sure that it was what my dad wanted, It brought so many memories."
4,Memories of Maverick,The DVD brought back memories of long gone evenings with the weekly update on how the brothers were getting along and what trouble they would end up in.Great fun to see again and no doubt again and again.Look forward to the next release.
4,Nice but very narrow,"I was looking for a nice umbrella stroller. I have the one in black color which doesnt recline , but it`s fine since my baby is old enough to sit without reclining.. I love everything about it - color , look , the handles are high enough , i dont kick wheels while walking.. I bet cup holder is a good thing to have on this stroller , caz black one doesnt have it , the only concern- it`s tooo narrow , baby in her winter outfit dosnt fit in there .. :(( And i m looking for a new stroller - if it was a lil bit wider it would be a verry good stroller!!"
2,A little disappointed...,"I needed a lightweight stroller that was easy to load and unload and it appeard from all aspects to be just that. And it was cute too! A week after I got this stroller, we were at the beach on the vacation that I purchased this stroller for, when the front wheel fell off. I checked to make sure I had put it on correctly and I had. This happens all the time and so I never use the stroller. I was very disappointed, I should have followed up and had them replace it but I hate sending things back and had already thrown away all my information and packaging. Bummed."
4,Good travel and everyday stroller,"I bought this to go to Disney with. It worked great. I did end up drapping a blanket over the conopy to provide more sun coverage, but it steers great and is light and fits in my trunk which was a great plus when we got home."
4,LOVE IT,"Love this stroller. The handles make it so much more comfortable to push. My girls; 2 and 5, fight over who gets to sit in the pink stroller. No underneath storage which was a bummer. But is great as an everdayday light weight stoller or as a back up. We bought it for our 5 year old when she got tired of walking around the amusement parks. Husband not to keen on the color or to be seen pushing a pink stroller, but oh well thats what happens when you have all girls. Definetly would recommend it, both of my strollers are by Jeep and I love them both."
3,Lightweight YES ... Comfortable NO,"I bought this stroller based on the reviews and once I receieved it, I was thrilled to see that it was exactly what I had hoped. We will be spending 4 days walking around downtown Chicago and I wanted something compact yet comfortable. It was super easy to assemble and SO cute! My hopes were dashed when I placed my 15 month old daughter in it. She's 26 lbs and 33 inches long and this was WAY too narrow for her. I felt like she was crammed in the seat. It wasn't as deep as I would have hoped as well. You can't beat the price and it was a pretty sleek stroller, just not the one for me. I returned it today and order the Combi Flare Lightweight stroller. It's double cost but I'm hoping for a bit more room for my daughter.Combi Flare Lightweight Stroller in Mandarin"
4,comfortable and easy,"Very easy to put together, 5 minutes MAX. Comfortable height for handles, if you are a taller person (I am 6ft) there is NO stooping!! The negatives I can say are the seat bottom seems a bit shallow for older children, but not uncomfortable to my 7 month old. And the sun shade seems a bit worthless but better than nothing. And the sun shade when folding does pop off, but it's not an inconvenience really. Colors are cute, the pink is quite bright but not offensive. For the money this stroller is excellent and light weight."
4,Excellent! though a bit narrow...,"I just assembled the stroller today, which was very easy. It is beautiful, although I found it a bit narrow (It says it holds babies up to 18.6 kg, but my 12kg baby fills the seat already!) I recommend it, it is comfortable and very easy to manage."
3,Not for tall people.,"This is a perfectly good stroller for people under about 5'10"". It maneuvers well, but at 6' tall, I have to reach a bit too much for the handles. My long legs also kick the locking mechanism on the rear wheels, which really isn't cute (or safe) when it happens in the middle of the street. Also, it is so lightweight that my diaper bag makes it dangerously off balance. Overall, I'd say a good value for the money, but not good for an everyday stroller."
4,Canopy Too Small,"I absolutely love this stroller because of its size and weight. It is very light and has just enough pockets to hold a few diapers and wipes along with a few toys on the other side. The cup holder on top is a nice addition too. It is very easy to manage and fits perfectly in my wife's trunk, taking up very little space. My only real complaint is the canopy. It is undersized and flimsy. The only way it blocks the sun is if it is directly overhead at noon. Otherwise, the canopy is pretty much useless because the sun is always in our little girls' eyes. All in all, I'd recommend this due to enough features and easy of use to overcome the canopy issue."
4,Great umbrella stroller,"I ordered this stroller after I saw the lesser model in the store. It was shipped free and quickly - Thanks Amazon. I am very pleased with sun shade. I like that it can be adjusted to block the sun no matter where, even my big deluxe stroller does not have that option. The height of the handle bars is a nice surprise as well. The super cheap umbrella strollers always have short handle bars and I end up kicking the wheels and cross bars. I have neither problem with the jeep umbrella stroller. It also folds up compactly and fits into the back of my vehicle nicely. Only negatives are width and color. The stroller could be made a little wider to allow baby/toddler more room and it is a little too pink for me. But, what do expect for an umbrella stroller!"
4,Okay for what it is,"If you are buying this as your only stroller I would suggest spending a few $$ more and get a ""real"" stroller with baskets and a real canopy. If you are buying it to have a smallish funky throw-in-the-trunk stroller then just buy a cheaper umbrella stroller. JMO. I returned it and just bought a $10 umbrella stroller for vacations and travel as I found this one did not fold up very small. The Jeep stroller though is way better quality and is super cute, but just does not fold up very small which is why I wanted an umbrella stroller in the first place."
4,Good Stroller,"The Jeep stroller is a really easy to use and set-up stroller!! If you are looking for one just to run around with instead of the bulky big strollers then this is a good choice. I love the way it rides, the wheels are great not sticky like most umbrealla strollers. The one thing I would want different is the sun shade, I wish that was bigger and that there was a bigger space to hold things. I would recommend this one because it is not ""cheap"" like alot of others its size."
1,incomplete,"I want you to know that my stroller was delivered in a box with tape under and on the top, it seemed like it was opened before! By the time we opened it and started assembling the stroller, we noticed that there were missing the rear wheels. Because of this I was not able to use and I do not want to keep it, I want to return it. what can I do to return the stroller and get my refund?"
4,Love it!!,"I love this stroller! Only thing that can get annoying is that when I fold up the stroller the canopy or the drink holder will occasionally pop off. Which isn't that bad, just irritating if I'm out somewhere or something. But overall, I love it! My daughter is very comfortable in it and the slight recline is perfect her to to sleep in. Also, love how easily it turns and moves. I had a stroller before that was so hard to turn I couldn't take it anywhere with tight spaces (like the mall), but this one is so easy to turn! Totally recommend this stroller!"
2,We bought several books in this series before I realized I just don't like them that much,"Can't fault the art, it's a great way to introduce kids to Degas.And the text... well, I can take it or leave it. It sounds trite to my ears, though, so I prefer to leave it. The author's got a tin ear when it comes to rhythm, nothing seems to scan right.The really bad part about these books is that they're cheaply made. I've had them fall apart on me while other books that we've had longer and that we read more often are in great shape.You can't have a poor-quality board book, it just doesn't work. I can't in good conscience recommend these books until that little problem is fixed."
4,Great intro to art,"Our 7 month old daughter loves the books in this series and gets very excited when we get ready to read them to her. I can only recommend these to anyone that wants to introduce their kids to art in a fun and exciting way. The poems that accompany each picture are fun and relate to each painting, which also helps expand their vocabulary."
3,Disappointed in size,"This a nice offset spatula, but small. The description says the ""blade"" is 9.75 inches, however, this is actually the full length of the knife, thus making it much smaller than I expected, making this somewhat expensive for such a small size. I guess I need to order the largest available, or go with the Oxo."
1,Rust!,"I bought this 2 months ago and finally had a chance to use it this weekend. It claims to be stainless steel, but after one usage the spatula is starting to rust. What a waste of $, now I can't even return it."
5,great,"If you are planning to work with crepes or large items in need of a long spatula, this is the one. However, be careful as it is metal and you need to watch your non-stick surfaces."
5,For waxing,"I use this for my personal waxing, and it's great because the wax never sticks, and flexible enough to use in any place. It's also VERY easy to clean, you just need some baby oil and cotton cloth, in case you're wondering."
1,Additional Tools Required,"You will require a special tool (that costs from $5-10) to open up your current casing and then replace it with this.You will also require special instructions on opening up the casing on the V300. As I found out, it is not easy! The V300 faceplate is actually embedded into the phone hardware.After all that, your service provider may not uphold any warranty/etc if you do in fact replace the faceplate.In fact, I found it too frustating/etc to bother with changing the faceplate. This is another expenditure not worth the hassle."
5,"Informative, I couldn't put the book down.","The book took a step by step aproach to the Roselawn disaster. It was very informative, and I couldn't put the book down. The author spoke through a pilot's perspective and let the reader feel every moment of the disaster. The details and aviation terms were explained fully by the author to let you understand them. The book explained why air safety is not at its upmost. I would recommend the book to anyone who wants to know the story of American Eagle 4184. It is a definite 10."
1,"Pilot At ""Authors"" Airline Speaks Out - Don't Buy This Book","As a pilot at the airlne when Mr. Fredrick used to work, and someone that knew three of the crewmembers in the crash of 4184, I find it revolting that he used this disaster to make a name for himself. He even tried to be a ""star"" at the NTSB hearings on the crash at Indianopolis.Also, I happened to see a multi-page letter that Mr. Fredrick wrote to the pilots union following the crash. He couldn't even write coherent paragraphs, let alone a book. This book has to be ghost-written.Also, if Mr. Fredrick was so wary of the ATR aircraft, why did he continue to fly the airplane at American Eagle even after the 4184 crash.Don't waste you time with this book. It only rewards someone who is driven by ego and profits off the backs of dead crash victims."
4,Needed towels,"that weren't decorative. I hate the towels that are decorated by cutting designs in the loops of the towel surface. They (the decorative) aren't absorbent. Since that was the majority of the towels I owned I went on Amazon to get some cheap but absorbent towels. These look nicer in person than they did online. The pink isn't obnoxious. They are medium quality (to me) towels and they do the job. They are larger than the old Target towels we wore out. The hems and stitching are not of high quality, but then I didn't expect them to be at this clearance price. They are absorbent enough and aren't scratchy. I'm happy with the purchase."
4,Can't beat this deal on Phil's greatest collection,"Great selection of Phil Collins songs, each sounding really good on piano. My copy had one slight error, having the improper key signature on ""One more night"", b-flat instead of e-flat. I love playing ""Easy Lover"", ""Two Hearts"", and ""Don't Lose my Number""; these uptempo songs sound especially lively -- and if you can sing with the passion of P.C. it will really get the party going."
4,Phil is the best,"This piano book is a must have for a true Phil Collins fan. It has all of his solo hits on here dating back to the 1980's and all the way up to his Tarzan movie hit, ""Son of Man"". Playing his songs on the piano are relatively moderately easy. There are some songs that are really difficult to play or get a rhythm for, or just don't sound good on the piano. The very first song ""Against All Odds"" is one of my favorite songs of all time. But unfortunately, the publishers messed it up badly. It is totally in a different key, doesn't sound anything like the song, so you might have to buy seperate sheet music for that song if you really want to play it, or if it's even available at all to buy seperately. The book is fun to play, but I would say to only buy this product if your really an avid fan of Phil Collins otherwise you might not like what you are getting."
5,Thanks Tupperware - No More Smushed Sandwiches!,"Leave it to tupperware to come up with the perfect solution for my sesame seed bun sandwiches! Even plastic baggies weren't this easy.My (1)red and (1)blue round sandwich keeper set hold my sandwiches perfectly, and even keep them fresh! Before I took them in sandwich bags and they got smashed! The ease of opening these couldnt be any better. Want to take a salad? Well this works great just for that. Fill the round sandwich keeper with your salad, and fill the smidget (small white lidded container that stores on top) with a dressing, or cheese perhaps?I can add yet another tupperware item to my list of enjoyable, useful purchases!as a added note my dad said he uses his to take his biscuit and egg breakfast to work in the mornings, then uses it to hold his burger (that he buys at McDonald's) until he can get a chance to eat it."
3,Could use a redesign,"I was so excited when I found these round keepers. I was planning to pack a daily salad for lunch at work. I should have investigated the design more closely before making a purchase. The bottom half of the container (where you put the item you are storing) is very shallow. If you want to pack a salad, plan on packing a very small side salad. If you try to pack anything bigger, you will have lettuce falling overboard as you eat. I would just flip in over, but the top is not flat, and therefore does not have good footing. This is a great concept. They just should have put the deep half on the bottom instead of the top."
3,A Dated Adventure Story,"Having finished Scaramouche not long ago, I looked forward to reading another Sabatini adventure tale. The writing is standard Sabatini. It is crisp and clear and he knows how to tell a good story.What was dissapointing is that the story has not aged well. It feels like something that was written in the 1920's. The characters lack any depth or nuance. Every thing is black and white. The story line is simplistic and predictable. Captain Blood is an Adventure Tale and not really an Adventure Novel.I love the adventure stories of this time period (ie. Buchan, PC Wren or Ouida) but the craft and art of the adventure novel has moved far beyond Sabatinis adventure tales of the 1920's. If you are looking for good sea stories, stick with Patrick O'Brien's Aubrey and Maturin series or CS Foresters' Hornblower Series. Captain Blood is interesting because it a precursor to much greater novels."
4,Free SF Reader,"Captain Blood is a classic pirate romp, entertaining and with plenty of action.Blood, the main character, helps the wrong guy, and earns the enmity of the authority types. He becomes a slave in the Carribean.He finds a hot chick, and escape to become the pirate Captain Blood."
5,"Great fun, not to be missed","This book is well worth your time, as are the two sequels. It's the facinating story of a doctor, wrongly accused of treason, and sold into slavery. He escapes to become a famous pirate. The book is full of adventure and romance. It is much better than the Errol Flynn movie that is based upon it."
1,modular mates leak plastic smell into food,I purchased several of the modular mates in 2009. I have tried everything to get the plastic smell out of them. They continue to leach the smell into any food that is stored in them. Tupperware's return policy is very limited and they will not return products after 30 days. I would highly not recommend these tupperware products for any type of food storage.
2,Beats are tight but no rap flow!!!,If you think this album is going to be good just because of Kurupt and Redman it's not.The beats are bangin but Chris has no flow.Work is definitely needed for his next album or he is gone.
2,Stick With Basketball C Webb,"Man!! I love C Webb and his game, been with him since Country Day in D, BUT, dude hasno flow man. He sounds like he needs some caffeine or prozac or something. Gangsta Gangsta is nice and so are the flows on the Redman track but thats it. The songs Chris sings by himself are repetitive, BUT I still love my dawg man and I ain't playa hatin', just callin it how I hear it. Anyway, buy this CD for 2 songs and show your loyalty to Webb anyhow!"
1,"Just like his game, comes up short at the end.","Good lord! Just like the way he plays basketball, CWebb just doesn't deliver at the end, when it all counts. He fails to show up in this album like he does for the Kings. I'm not sure a trade involving him for Shaq in the NBA would be fair, but it's more fair than trading his CD for a 1-ply half-used up roll of toilet paper."
1,national geographic TOPO,"THis CD-ROM is hopelessly out of date..only good for a computer at last 8 to 10 years old, according to my Apple store. it would not work in any of my 3 apple computers.And if this was explained in the listing I certainly missed it...I think the advertising was misleading and when it was all done with the item shipped back I still lost money.I definitely paid some tuition for my education."
4,Good unit,"I bought this unit used but returned it because it wasn't the model that I thought I was getting. No problems getting my refund through Amazon and bought the CPS LDA 1000 model. Did try it out though and it seemed to work just fine. After talking to the people at CPS, the model I got (not a LS790B) was just an earlier version."
4,A new fan finds heaven!,"I was unaware of Jonatha Brooke until I sampled the ""Live"" album at a music store. I loved it! It is unusual to find such talented song writing and a CD you don't mind putting on replay! I highly recommend this CD."
3,Coulda been better,"I loved Plumb, liked 10cent wings, and I was hoping for more on this one. I had to buy it and i'm not disappointed in the music, I just wanted more out of it. People Magazine liked ""Where were you"" though that could be her worst song. But then again, I don't like most country music."
4,Fair to good,"At least a person can watch this with thier kids, it is what I remember our son watching when he was a kid."
3,Not So Believable,"Even though we never questioned it at the time this one was not as believable as others. As nieve as we were the situations and cliffhangers didn't hold up on this one. They cheated on this as well on the cliffhangers. We still enjoyed, and it belongs to entertainment of the time. A good, but thin story line. We took them for what they were."
2,"Very cheap, poor quality prints","I just learned my lesson by trying to save a couple dollars and buying this paper instead of my usual...it is very cheap and the colors are really muted and poor quality when printing on it. The paper is so thin that when you print on it, the pictures fold. I'm using it in an Epson Artisan printer that normally prints very pretty, colorful pictures."
1,Terrible quality on my HP printer,"I bought this for my HP Photosmart C5280 All-In-Printer. Big mistake. Despite the claim on the cover that the paper ""Works with HP"" the quality was terrible whatever settings I tried. If you own a printer like mine don't bother with this."
3,"Great information, but boring","The book has a lot of information, I just find it to be dry. I am highly interested in the topic, but reading this seems like pulling teeth. There must be a more interesting way to introduce interesting topics."
4,cognition text books,fairly new book with very few markings. Book was received promptly and at a reasonable price. service was fast and efficient
2,Uneven toasting,"The tops are very dark and the bottoms are not even warm! We have to flip the bread and toast a second time. And, it takes a very long time to toast."
2,Toast,"Well, if you would like to read the paper and have a cup of coffee while your bread is toasting this is the toaster for you. Seriously, it takes a lonnnggg time to toast anything."
1,"Worked badly, broke quickly","This toaster didn't work very well out of the box, and the only good news is it didn't last more than a couple of months before breaking, so we didn't have to put up with its lousy performance for very long. If this toaster is any indication, Cuisinart has thrown in the towel and begun selling junk."
1,Disappointing,"We were very excited to receive this as a gift. FINALLY, we thought, we'd own a GOOD toaster - not the typical, unreliable piece of crap. After about a year it's performance became spotty and unreliable. We've owned it for 4 years now and have been ready for a new toaster for most of that time. My sister received the same toaster as a gift the same year we did, and I'm told hers hit the trash over a year ago. I would have expected better than this from Cuisinart, especially for the price."
2,Slim but not long lasting,"We got this toaster because it's so slim and takes of very little counter space. We've been happy with it, but after only a year it's struggling to work. The electronics are flakey and makes it very tedious to get your toast toasted. I am pretty disappointed after spending more money for what appeared to be a great toaster."
1,I want both sides toasted,"This is a great toaster for those who cannot make up their minds. Do you want toast or warm bread? With this toaster you can have both! After toasting, one side was beautifully browned while the other side remained untoasted. When inspecting the heating coils, the coils on the outside heated up faster and hotter than the coils in the middle section. We kept this toaster less than a week and returned it for a full refund. This is my second Cuisinart toaster and I will never purchase another one again!"
1,Extreme diappointment,"I liked the looks of this toaster and mistakenly believed that higher price would certainly translate to higher quality. I actually prefer my $9.99 toaster. The slots are not deep enough so the tops of the bread are not toasted. If one side is brown, the other is burned black. Now I am saddled with this albatross--I can't justify throwing it away (which I would like to do) and I can't even give it away (no one in my family wants it.) My advice: Don't buy this."
2,Looks nice...,"I usually only buy high end appliances, so take me seriously when I say if you buy this, you are only buying it for looks. Truly, when I use the display for light/darkness or bagel setting, I cannot tell the difference between this and a less expensive toaster. If you are going to invest in a high end toaster, I'd advise looking elsewhere. I actually am about to buy the Cuisinart toaster oven ... which has gotten great reviews by people and Consumer reports. If you do decide to go ahead with this one, shop around. I got the exact same four slice electronic model at ..."
1,I'm through with Cuisinart!,"I read all the reviews here before buying, and all I can say is there must be lots of toaster inconsistencies out there in America. This is my second Cuisinart. I had previously bought the 4 slice stainless model. One of the heating elements broke after 2 years,and after some research I purchased this model. I totally agree with the negative coments listed on this site. Our toast is toasted on one side, barely toasted on the other. Sometimes it burns on level 2, other times you need to push it down several times on level 5 to get it lightly brown. When the kids and husband are complaining about it, you know there is a problem! I only wish I had kept the box to return it, but now it's too late. The only consolation is that in reading reviews of other brands, there seems to be the same types on inconsistent product quality among them as well!"
1,half a slice?,"After a year of use it now only toasts on one side, seems like for (the money) one could expect better reliability????"
4,A Toast to This Toaster,"I had the one slot version and thought it was just ""OK."" Recently, I bought the two slot version and like it much better. (Maybe the first one wasn't right to begin with.)The wide, long slots are great for non-standard breads, waffles and bagels. I usually keep bread in the freezer for freshness, and the ""Defrost"" button gives me almost the same toast as I'd get from room temp bread, without changing my normal setting."
3,Good enough,"I wanted to alert you to a problem I had originally with this toaster and one which several other reviewers also had---and one I solved! The first time I put in my bread it only toasted on one side. I found out that this was due to my not putting it in the correct slot---if you only are toasting 1 or 2 slices, you must put it in the front slot, not the back. The second time, the bread toasted beautifully.This toaster is fine but doesn't really have the oomph-factor. It is very big (takes up lots of room on the countertop) and not deep enough to toast the tops of tall bread. Other than that, its fine. But pricey--I don't think that it provides enough bang for the buck."
5,Great unit if you can read instructions.,"This is a great toaster unless you are technically challenged as I suspect some Senior Citizens who reviewed earlier are. Reading the instructions will answer all your questions and allow you great results with your breads. The light will stay on when you are not using it. Thus, the instructions plainly state to unplug the toaster when not in use. I am sure this would also extend the life of the toaster too. I freeze all my breads now and then use the defrost setting and it works very well and cooks very evenly. I love not having my breads spoil. Again, READ the instructions. A little common sense goes a long way."
2,"well, not to complain but....","Not much different than the good ol normal toaster that cost less. I do like the high ""techness"" to it but now if I could just figure it out- It was a Christmas gift and still a good toaster, extra long space to do 2 slices but still for the price I would like it to butter my toast too. :)"
5,Excellent,"Charles Johnson is one of the most neglected writers living today. He, along with William Kennedy, often get shunned aside for their poetic quality in their work. The best story in this series is ""Moving Pictures"" which gives an excellent appreciation for the arts. His prose is rich and musical- plenty of lines would work in poems. The story about the 2 kids and the old woman was probably the weakest tale. Not bad, but not the best- just goes to show how the most simple of his tales gets all the praise. Johnson takes risks, and takes them well. He is not afraid to be poetic & every work of his I've read has been a pleasure. I highly recommend ""Oxherding Tale"" because the ending is out of this world. Charles, if you are reading this- keep up the excellent work. There are those who really appreciate your style, and I think in time will grant you more acclaim. Bravo!"
5,A Great Deal!,"I bought 5 ties in varying prices for my 8 year old to choose from. Although this was not that much, it was the most expensive and the one he choose. It made a bargain suit look like a designer buy!"
2,A little bit of little stuff,I ordered this thinking it would have some larger items. The picture was deceptive.... I have 4 pieces I will never use because they are TINY!! If you need small pieces of tupperware this is great - if not - this is not for you.
3,Good alternative music.,"Overall a good cd with different music not heard ever on radio. I don't like how choppy the tracks are put together. It kind of takes away from the live feeling of cd. Other than that is some good listening, not the same old stuff heard everyday on U.S. radio. 2 cd's w/good amount of songs."
5,Excellent - lots of very useful info,"When I changed jobs to program from C++/Smalltalk to Java, this is the book I used the most for the first couple of months. Lots of useful information that is easy to find (each tidbit is pretty much stand alone). I still use it a lot."
3,ATL Server Programming.,I want be perfect in Web Server programming. I am student doing BCA 2 year from IGNOU. I have been involved inside software field since three or four year's. I have finished the JAVA 2 and complete the JDBC XML Java Scripting UML and good depth programming in TCP/IP. I need some goods skill in the Web Server Programming. I will be thank full for you if you will suggest me to get me the right channel.
3,Great book but outdated...,"This really is a nice book but if you get it, don't be surprised to find out that a TON of methods in the classes have been deprecated in JAVA 1.1. Since JAVA 1.2 is around the corner, I'd make sure this is the book you want.A lot of neat stuff in JAVA 1.1 is not in this book that's critical to JAVA programming (i.e. event handling, printing, cutting and pasting,)."
1,Plagerized book,"I've already said it, but I'll say it again. Don't buy this book. This person has plagerized portions of other people's work. She's created a new low: plagerize your story and then self-publish it. *rolls eyes*"
2,Dr Kracker - sorry Amazon,Dr Kracker makes an excellent product; unfortunately Amazon delivers either the wrong product or one at or near the expiration date almost every time. Sorry Amazon; although your price point is good; I'll spend more at the store and get fresh products and the correct items from now on. Disappointed in Monterey.
5,My Satisfying Crunchy Snack,"I love these ""Krackers"" - Put a little Smart Balance Peanut Butter on and it makes for a great pick me up when I'm hungry!"
4,CRRRRRRUNCH!,"Cheesy, crunchy, nutty. Dr. Kracker fills my tummy between meals and gives me that wicked CCRRRRRRUUNCH that I love. I enjoy my Dr. Kracker with a cup of tea or a glass of water. I haven't tried anything on top yet. They are not salty, just dry and very, very crunchy. I have to eat them by myself because my husband can't stand the crunching sound. Way better than chips/crisps."
3,Great Snack,A delicious snack just as they are. Crunchy with good flavor. Also good with salads and cheese spread.
2,Hard (not crunchy) and very bland,"I was really disappointed with the flavor, or lack thereof, and the extremely hard texture was like eating concrete. I was expecting a gourmet experience, but this looked like it did on the box and tasted like it too. Would not recommend."
3,Decent,"For some reason I thought these crackers would be much better than they are. Maybe it's because I've never had ""flatbread"" before and I just found them extremely hard. The pumpkin seed and cheese is a good flavor combo, but I just don't enjoy the hard-as-a-rock texture."
1,CRAP!,"My wife received this ""weather station"" as a gift from her employer. It doesn't work. The temperature is off by at least 8 degrees and the clock won't set itself as advertised. I'm about to e-mail LaCrosse, but based on previous reviews, and the fact that LaCrosse would market this junk, I don't expect any satisfaction. Avoid this product!"
1,Very Disappointed,I purchased the Tupperware can opener about 1 1/2 years ago. At first I loved it. After about 6 months it started to not work on all my cans. I kept trying and was continually frustrated. I contacted my Tupperware dealer and she gladly replaced it. After about a month it started doing the same thing. I heard somewhere that it does not work on a certain brand of cans. I do use a lot of this brand but if it will not work on all my cans I need something different. I just contacted Tupperware directly and they told me they could not do anything for me because it was over 1 year since I purchased it. I don't feel they have very good customer service. The opener is rather pricey. I purchased something similar from the grocery store for 1/3 the Tupperware price and have not had any problems as of yet. Very disappointed with Tupperware on this one.
5,"Very tasty, very healthy!","I love Dr. Kracker products - full of crunch, full of taste, full of fiber. They are tasty alone as a healthy snack or a great accompaniment to cheese and all sorts of spreads as an hors d'oeuvre. Just remember to have a lot of liquid when eating high fiber foods!"
5,good and crunchy,"I have been trying to find theses crackers for some time. They are very tasty and low in carbs, high in fibre."
2,Name of product is misleading,"Okay, yes, I know the brand is Dr. Kracker and maybe that should have been a clue as to the texture of this product. However, I have had flatbreads made by other companies that were actually the texture of a pita. These are VERY crunchy and don't have a whole lot of flavor. Additionally, they were shipped and arrived expired. If you are shopping for a super-healthy cracker, this may be it. If you are looking for a whole grain flatbread with the texture of a pita, keep shopping - this is not it. My next venture for this product is to grind it up and use as bread crumbs on top of broiled tilapia."
3,Tastes different than the one purchased from store,"I fell in love w/ this cracker months ago and have been purchasing them regularly from local grocery store until I fond on Amazon and decided to try the auto shipment since that worked out great for some cereals the family loves. The crackers in the first shipment of 6 boxes taste different than the ones I bought in the grocery stores for several months. Not sure why, if these didn't pass the taste/quality/freshness test in lab or what, but I'm willing to give it one more try to see how the batch is with the next shipment. Great value on the auto shipment so worth another try but will cancel if next batch the same as the first."
5,Yummy and healthful,These crackers taste GREAT. I don't like eating wheat because it can cause blood sugar problems. But these crackers don't create that problem for me. I love the taste and they feel healthful.
5,These krackers are terrific.,These krackers are terrific and very healthy for you. A good way to get your carbs.
2,rule Britania,"I love the Selecter,must have seen them a dozen times.But by this album I,ve given up.Pauline,s constant bitching about how bad it is in England is getting boring.'Pauline dear if you dont like it go back to Jamaica'.Also if you tour under the name Selecter try getting someone other than your self who actualy played in the band to come allong.Last time I saw you the band only new half your songs.Preaching to your prodominantly white audiance that we are all a bunch of right wing scum does not help gain freands.If we did not like Black people we would not be at the show.Stick to the great Ska that you do so well,and we can all get allong black & white."
3,Not the shade of Blue shown,I ordered these because I liked the darker Blue top compared to the same canisters for less with a brighter blue top. Turns out the blues are the same.
2,Impossible to open,"They seal well and I can close them (some force), however opening them is nearly impossible. We have all tried and have come to the decision that this must be a design flaw. The small lip is painful on your fingers. They really should have put a little finger lip that you could get your finger under or a slightly larger lip. Right now the lip just is painful.I have purchased some Rubbermaid serving savers which are much nicer to open and close."
3,Not bad for baseball fans,"Ok, not the greatest story ever, but a really good book to get a reluctant (reader) 7-year-old baseball fan to read. My son and I take turns reading every other page. And I like the message of this book -"" ...try, try again"" or ""practice makes perfect"" - something along those lines."
2,Your Out of Here!!,"I didn't particularly like Here Comes the Strikeout. I thought the reading level was a little higher then what they said it was. It was also a little long and I don't think it could keep a child's interest. Young children are mainly looking at the pictures and this book didn't have good pictures that really illustrated what the book was trying to say. I would recommend with book for first graders maybe, but not kids younger then that. The vocabulary is simple but some of the words in sentences are quite tongue-twisters and I think this will get children discouraged if they can't say them. All together, I really don't like this book for young children."
2,Software driver problems,"This product works well when it works, but all too often it does not work. The Win2k driver, even when installed carefully, often fails to recognise media. I am a computer professional, and I tried various tactics; I can now make it work, but it is complicated, fiddly, and ridiculous. Phone and email support are useless (gave up after 45 minutes on hold on the phone, even when email questions are accepted and acknowledged no reply ever arrives). Avoid this product."
1,Many problems with this reader,"Have had massive problems with two of these readers that I bought for work. One of them repeatedly disappears from my computer after I read and remove a card, and I have to reboot to bring it back. The other has somehow corrupted two Smartmedia cards and made them unusable. Zio supposedly has a firmware upgrade but so far has not actually sent it, nor is it available on their website, not to mention they said you can only install it with a Win98 system... Avoid this product, by all means."
1,Avoid use with smart media cards,Use of this product has resulted in the unusability of my two smart media cards in the past 24 hours. The company's FAQ page in their tech support page states that this is due to old firm ware. I cannot find a solution to this problem online.
2,mechanical issues,"Works fine under Win2K but the problems are mechanical. The vertical stand is useless. Also, do not insert a CF card sideways!!! It will slide in and rattle around forever, until you remove the two screws under rubber feet to retrieve it. Note to Dazzle engineers: block the naive user from inserting the card sideways!"
5,great boots,"These boots are adorable, my daughter loves the color, the stitching and the ""high heel"". Very nicely made, they should hold up well."
4,toss.,I like the size and weight of the bean bags to teach children tossing. I also like that the bags are colored with the name written on each bag. These bean bags were exactly what I have been looking for to teach my granddaughter to toss and learn colors.
4,Great Wireless Weather Station,"I purchased this item as a gift. The reciepent called to say that the item was something that could really be used and appreciated. The numbers are large enough to see without glasses , most of the time. The time is accurate, as is the temperature."
1,Impossible to get what you want,"It looks nice, but thats pretty much where it ends. To my disappointment you can not see the Rain Gauge unless you push buttons in a certain sequence, and that sequence is impossible to remember. The button labels make no sense, the instructions are complicated and you need them every time you want to see another function. The are 2 ""Mode"" and it depends what Mode you are in as to what the buttons do, but there is no indication of what mode you are even in. I paid $90 for this POS in the store, Not worth even Ten. Battery life is so-so and I've yet to figure out where I can read the Indoor temperature if it even exists. Don't buy. I think you would be better off buying each instrument seperate instead of this all-in-one. Don't buy it!"
1,Waste of money,"Worked nice for couple or three months. Then stopped to feel the outdoor sensor. New set of batteries helped just for several days, and finally outdoor temp became totally unavailable. Then it started to drain indoor batteries so that even indoor temp became a problem. Keep off this crap!"
4,Not as advertised,"This is a good unit, but it does not provide indoor/outdoor humidity, only indoor. If you are looking for outdoor humidity like I was, keep looking. Aside from that, it is a good unit, especially for this price."
2,Works great for 2 months,"This toaster worked perfectly for 2 months used once a week.then one day I put a bagel in the toaster and about 5 min later there was billowing smoke coming from the toaster. I pressed the cancel button, nothing I then had to pull the lever up and two bagel briquettes popped up. I then put another bagel in and immediatly hit the cancel button, nothing. The only thing this toaster is good for now is making carbon. It has two settings on and off. I am boycotting all cuisinart products.mark"
1,This Toaster couldn't [stink] worse... really.. read why!!,"Great looking toaster... reminds me of my ex-wife... great to look at but completely worthless. I love the concept; the heating elements moves to adjust themselves to the bagel, toast, pizza, whathaveyou... the catch is the thing is dumb as a post. Put in a bagel or bread and you never know how it is going to come out of the toaster. Setting it on 3 may yield tan or black toast... so if you set it to one, you get warm bread... hit it again on one and the bread turns dark brown.This really stinks for me, because I was pretty excited to get it home. My other toaster was with me for 15 years. I pulled it out of the trash and toasted my bagel with it this morning, that is how much this one stinks.P.S. It does do an outstanding job of warming cold pizza to near original quality!! I put it on it's side and pushed the lever and watched in amazement as my slice got perfectly oven hot, crisp and fresh!!"
2,"Requires a lot of repairs, but if you are willing, it's a nice toaster",The first model I got had a glow bar on each side. One or the other would burn out after a few months. I had bought extended service and on the 3rd replacement I was upgraded to the CPT35. It had heating wires and was more reliable. I also have the buzzing problem others mention. What happens is that the wire clip on one side overheats and fatigues. I re-crimped it several times then finally replaced it. Seems to need a repair about once a year. But I like the size and the way it works so I eeked about 7 years out of my investment.
5,A toaster like no other!,"Bagels, toast, any bread, hot pockets this baby toasts them all!Outside of toaster does not get hot! I have owned it for approximately two years and it has never failed to work. Arrive at your price and purchase. You too, will love it."
4,This is the one for me-maybe for you too!,"After going through sevral toasters, I am pleased with this one. It is wide enough for bagels, which was my main reason for getting it. Beyond that, the settings are accurate, meaning if I put it some where in the middle, my toast doesn't look like it came out of a bonfire. My only complaint is that it is bigger then I thought it would be, taking quite a bit of room on my counter. So, if you, like me, where frustrated with tiny slots when you wanted a bagel, this is the toaster for you."
4,You get what you pay for,"The Cuisinart CPT-35 is a relatively inexpensive, no frills toaster, so you can't expect much from it. It toasts well, although you can't leave the setting on 3 and expect it to toast a frozen bagel as well as a thin slice of wheat bread. You DO have to change the settings for individual items. The extra wide slot is great for large, specialty shop bagels. The cancel button works as an ejector so you don't have to force up the toasting lever. The crumb tray slides out easily for cleaning.In case you can't tell from the picture, this is a long, narrow machine - the two slices go side by side, not across from each other. The construction is lightweight, at least compared to my old T-Fal toaster.You won't find fancy features with this toaster. The cancel button and the wide slot are the only notable features, and they are hardly high-tech. For an inexpensive toaster, the Cuisinart works as well as can be expected."
2,Perplexed,"We had a Black & Decker toaster that didn't toast. We read the ratings and felt the extra money spent on a Cuisinart was well worth the cost if the toaster toasted. The first thing we tried was English muffins...the toaster took forever and didn't toast the muffins. We turned the settings the entire way up, but the result was still inadequate. The Cuisinart doesn't toast anything so far but bread. I could do that in my broiler. Needless to say we are perplexed, unsatisfied with the product and disappointed."
1,Junk!!,"Almost every morning my wife yells ""when are you going to throw this toaster away!"" We have had it for approximately two years, and even when brand new, it has never toasted evenly. Sometimes for no apparent reason and with no relationship to whether it is hot or cold (and no explanation in the instructions) the toast won't stay down and an extremely loud buzz (it makes the cats flee the kitchen!) that sounds like an alarm comes out of it. Hitting the cancel button, unplugging it, won't ""reset"" it, it just stops buzzing and starts working again when it feels like it. Sometimes the toast won't stay down and there is no buzz. Buy another brand!"
2,UNEVEN TOASTING AND TIMER KNOB DOESN'T GIVE ENOUGH TIME,"I know it's a [poor] toaster, but I would have expected a minimum level of quality. The bread toasts unevenly, no matter what kind of bread we have tried. The timing is unreliable, and changes from use to use. We have ours set on 5 (darkest), and often have to send the toast back through for another go around -- when we then have to peer into the toaster and pop it up when it is brown or risk burning. I wish I had another chance -- but now that I've bought it I'm stuck with this one until it breaks. Maybe I'll get it right the second time around. IT WON'T BE A CUISINART THE NEXT TIME."
1,Waste of money,I had my toaster 2 years it never toasted evenly burned edges before the middle browned. Even worse the realease button broke off making the toaster useless. My best friend returned hers right away as I should have.
2,Am I supposed to be able to see anything?,"The mirror attached to this product is a very low quality material that makes seeing anything with it pretty much impossible. The item is also rather heavy for what it is. Do not buy this product, as the only mirror function it serves is something to cut your coke on, you drug addict."
5,Excellent..Easy..Tasty,"John Sineno has put together an excellent book filled with recipes that are easy to follow and more importantly great tasting! His little side stories and captions give great insight as to where Mr. Sineno passion for cooking and firefighters comes from. Having used his cookbook and also having the pleasure to meet the author, it is easily understood why firefighters have come to know him as ""Mama Sineno""."
3,Good Movie. Bad screen format,"Very nice movie, but I happen to be partial to seeing movies as they were shot and intended to be seen. This movie was shot in widescreen but the DVD release is formatted to fit the TV screen. It thereby loses its visual integrity and a couple of reviewer stars."
1,Leave it to Artisan...,"Artisan is the worst!Having never seen this film, I was extremely excited to see that it was to be released on DVD finally...until I noticed that Artisan was going to release it. Sure enough, Artisan has done it again, offering The Hit in a pan & scan format. Surely this is not an action cheapie, and as such deserves better treatment than Artisan is putting out.If you don't care about format, ignore my review. If you do care, I suggest that you be careful buying any Artisan DVDs, as they are releasing loads of P & S titles these days.Would someone in authority please advise Artisan to raise their price point and release these films in a double-sided disc offering both formats, a la Warner Brothers?"
4,John Hurt's finest,"John Hurt is the star here, a polished professional hit man without emotions . . . until things start to come apart. Saddled with a smartass punk assistant, Hurt is assigned to hit a stool pidgeon who turns out to be amateur philosopher, facing death with equanamity. As the job goes from bad to worse, turning into a kind of road trip from hell, Hurt resigns himself to a sort of passivity, accepting situations that madden him, relinquishing control of himself in a state of detachment that is troubling to see. You almost want him to kill all these people and regain his deportment, rather than accept one insult after another to his dignity as a professional.Hurt is perfect in the role, and the supporting cast make up an excellent ensemble, of sorts. The hero is doomed of course, but the journey to the end is well worth the trip. Outstanding."
1,Five-star movie gets One-star DVD treatment,"Stephen Frears' near-brilliant comedy/drama is one of the most under-rated films of all time. It's a shame that it doesn't get more attention given the superb cast (Terence Stamp, John Hurt, Tim Roth). This is one of my all-time favorites but sadly this is another botched DVD job by Artisan. Let's hope Criterion gets a hold of this beauty of a film and does it some justice. At least get it in widescreen!"
4,works well,"As long as it continues to cut up my winter squash, I shall be a happy customer. So far, so good."
4,Nice Product,given as a gift; recipient very pleased with performance and looks! May even order one for myself and other friends....
2,piece of junk,the product is very cheaply made and doesn't hold up. The on-off trigger just fell out of the unit one day for no reason. very noisy unit. not well designed.
2,Cuisinart CEK-40 Electric Knife,"I thought this electric knife would be the same quality as other Cuisinart items I have. However, this one was a disappointment. Besides the handle being uncomfortable, the major reason for return is that the knife handle got quite hot after the first use. It was being used to cut thru a very moist brined turkey breast and not much pressure was needed. We have since replaced the Cuisinart with a Black & Decker 700 Slim Line and are very pleased with it. Not to mention, the price was way less for a better knife."
2,"Disappointing Durability, Bad Design","I purchased two of these electric knives after reading the Amazon.com reviews and because I trust Cuisinart products. Although the knife performed well, after only a very few uses the on-off trigger control button simply fell off without warning - and this in the midst of carving holiday turkey for a crowd. I was left to scramble to find and sharpen another knife to get the job done while guests were waiting and the bird was getting cold. Very exasperating and embarrassing. This exact scenario was repeated with the second knife purchased as well. I am very disappointed and can't understand why this vital component hadn't been better designed. Cuisinart: your ""bad""."
1,Big problem,"When this knife first arrived, it was great. It cut great and I couldn't have been happier with it. Then, within a week or two, it began to stop cutting even though the motor still was running. Sort of like it locked up when it had to cut through something more than a simple loaf of bread. I was very unhappy and sent it back. Did not reorder so I don't know if it was just a one item problem or something general with these knives."
5,Love it,"I picked this item up at a local store. I used it to cut steak for a stir fry and for a loaf of bread. I stacked 3 steaks on top of each other and it cut through all three effortlessly. It is easy to use and does an excellent job. It was much easier than doing it by hand and the cuts were nice and clean (and no crumbling for the bread). I had tried another brand and it was not useable at all ... so I'm glad that I tried this product (almost gave up after the first one). I like the holder for this, but it would have been more functional if it was set up to hang on the wall or had a dedicated stand to hold it up on the counter."
2,Quit already!,"This knife is both under-powered and has quit already - the same switch problem others have found.I bake bread and like an electric knife to cut it - I'll look for a cheaper brand this time!My old, cheaper-brand knife lasted 10 years of bread slicing! and I would have purchased that brand again but couldn't find it."
1,Don't buy this knife!!!!!!,Do not buy this knife! We just threw out the third knife that we had replaced. All three knives had bad trigger switches. You would think that a company with a rep like Cuisinart would take care of a ongoing problem like the switch but all three knives had the same problem. We will never buy another Cuisinart product again. They need to get their act together.
3,Electric Knife,"Knife has good power. The Storage system is good. The knife cuts OK, but not great. I like to see a good cordless knife that was well made and durable, with a good battery.Cuisinart CEK-40 Electric Knife"
2,A piece of junk,I used this knife two times and the cheaply made trigger mechanism fell apart in my hand . Further inspection revealed that a tiny pice of plastic that holds the trigger in place broke off. Ive got it taped right now but it only works intermittently.
1,not worth the money,"We had an electric knife as a wedding gift 26 years ago that finally gave out. Our daughter bought us this one as a gift thinking the brand would be even better. It lasted 4 months! Minimal use, maybe 3 times a month. My original knife was proctor silex so I will be looking for another one. The Cuisinart was a complete let down since they are usually a good value. It's made us stay clear of their appliances completely even though I like the cookware."
4,Great at slicing!,Once you get it together it works great! A little hard getting it together and to stand up.Would also be nice if it could be wall mounted.Also would like better comparative pricing.
2,Cuisinart electric carving knife,I used it once on a properly cooked brisket and it did great until halfway through when it got quite hot and smelled like something burning. It also slowed down. I don't think a 5 pound 6 hour braised and boneless roast should challenge this device. It was also the most expensive knife. I promptly returned it.
2,Bread slicer disappointment,"A great disappointment for the Cuisinart name: the handle heats up during, not after, the slicing. Blade is not real sharp. A piece of China junk compared with my 40 + year old slicer from G.E. (made in the USA). Would not recommend this product."
5,Wish I had one of my own,"My best friend received this as a wedding gift and never uses it. It just sits on her counter. However, when she hosts holiday meals at her place, this is the first knife I go for! I first used it to cut up turkey and WHOH! I never felt that great a sense of accomplishment while cutting up food! I used it to cut the easter ham up and it worked GREAT! I love it so much, I put it on my wish list"
1,Good while it lasted,"We enjoyed enjoyed this knife while it lasted. My wife liked the way it fit her hand, its balance, and the way it did everything she wanted it to do. I didn't use it as much as my wife, but I found it to have the same qualities.The weak point on our unit was the switch. The little safety button stopped doing its job about a year ago and the whole tirgger part of the switch eventually fell out of the unit, along with some little plastic pieces that appear to have made up some kind of catch that held the trigger in place. Since it looks like the pieces are broken broken off of the plastic housing, it doen's look like it's fixable.In terms of how it worked, this design deserves 5 stars. In terms of its durability . . . well let's just say that it isn't in the same league as my mother-in-law's Montgomery Ward branded knife that is older than my wife (40+ just don't tell her I said that) and works like it's brand new."
1,disappointed,"I am disappointed in the limited performance of this product, particularly given the great reputation of this manufacturer of other quality appliances. At first it performed well but ""burned out"" shortly after purchase. Although the company replaced with a new one without question, it too died within a few months. With Thanksgiving coming, I am shopping for a more reliable product."
1,"Works for a short while, then completely dies","This knife worked well prior to an untimely death, after being used only a handful of times. I contacted Cuisinart, only to be informed that the 3 year warranty begins as of manufature date; it doesn't matter when it actually made it to the consumer. Needless to say, I will never purchase another Cuisinart product again."
5,We love this electric knife!!,I make the bread and he slices the bread! Worth the extra money. Dual knives (one for bread and the other for meat) makes it even better. Neat good-looking stand if you have to leave it on the counter. Great product from a reputable company.
5,Cuisinart Electric Knife,This is the best electric knife that I have ever used. With 2 blades it is very versatile. I read the reviews before I bought this product and agree with everyone else that said what an excellent product it was.
1,don't waste your money,"this knife worked for less than a month, then totally quit. my $15 black & decker still works after 20 years."
5,Electric Knife,Best Electric Knife we have ever used. Service from the original order to the delivery was speedy and appreciated.
1,Poor Quality,"the on/off switch is made of plastic and broke after 5-7 uses. We couldn't get it to work again, $40 down the drain. Cuisnart stinks. Had a $115 coffee maker from Cuisnart that crapped out too, after 1 year. Pathetic"
3,Cuisinart Electric Knife,"Nice look and feel, however I do not see any marked difference in performance to my previous electric knife..............and it cost 3 times more. That just doesn't equate to value!"
3,quality knife except for cheap gears that stripped,"I like the Cusinart CEK-40 electric knife. But after using it about 10 times the gears that active the cutting portion of the knife were stripped. this was with normal wear and tear. For a product that costs $50, you would expect it to be much more durable than this. I am truly disappointed with this product."
3,"Five Stars when it works, Zero when it DIES","I got the knife as a Christmas gift and loved it for probably five years. I carved a lot of cooked and raw meat with the meat blade. I would buy a whole pork loin and carve chops and schitzels to freeze for later in just a couple of minutes! My bread machine bread carved into perfect uniform slices for freezing with the bread blade. I was horrified when it just quit working reliably one day. It would hesitate, go a little, stop, go a little more. It was dangerous to use in that condition so I threw it out. I probably used the knife reliably for five years, maybe that is a reasonable life for a knife. I can't live without it so after reading the reviews of other cheaper and worse knives, I guess I will buy another one!"
1,Not long lasting.,This knife lasted 14 months. It cut well when it operated. The switch failed and when I tried to take it apart to replace I found that it was so poorly designed that you could not remove the switch with out breaking the glued in place cover.
5,great knife,"This is my second one (wish the other had lasted more than 5 years) Light, easy to use and hold. I love a good sharp knife, but you can't beat an electric for bread, cake, turkey."
5,Superior Electric Knife,"The Cuisinart CEK-40 Electric Knife is by far the best ever, and I've used three other brands. The knife and blades store securely in the very attractive tray and the attached cord tucks away neatly behind the stand. I especially like the bread knife which works wonderfully on crusty breads. The blades slip easily into the knife handle and are just as easily removed. This is definitely a quality product and well worth the price."
1,stripped gears,"I am very disappointed with this product. I was carving my Thanksgiving turkey yesterday when the knife stopped working after it got hooked on bone in the wing. The motor continued to work, but the blades stopped moving. The knife has only been used 3 times, but I had to throw it out today. I opened the plastic case, and found a metal worm gear coming off the motor shaft,and a cheap nylon gear attached to it to move the blades back and forth. The nylon gear was stripped and the knife was useless. My prior knife, much less expensive, lasted for 18 years. The Cuisinart knife is not well made and only works well when it is not under any stress."
1,Lifespan=4 years of intermittent use,"We received this knife for our wedding (August 2005). It started displaying intermittent switch behavior after 4 years of light use. The switch will only activate the knife about 30% of the time. Obviously the switch has gone bad. When I contacted Cuisinart, they declined to do anything about it because it was out of the 3 year warranty. Not very good performance for a $50 knife."
1,Does not last,"Bought the knife June 8, 2008 was used only for slicing bread, went to use it Nov 15, 2009 and it was dead. Something must have burned up in it. I have and old electric knife I've had for 20+ years that's still going strong. I just liked the thicker blade for the bread knife that was on the Cuisinart knife, guess I'll just use my old knife until if finally goes. Too bad I did like the knife while it worked."
1,poorly manufactured appliance,"This product is a piece of junk.My first knife quit after six months.The replacement I received lasted about nine months and customer service was totally uncooperative making me jump thru hoops as I sought to get another replacement.I gave up on this asI knew as I got nowhere with a rude,inconsiderate person.I am going to purchase another but I will never buy any Cuisinart product.jm memphis"
1,Great while it lasted,"The Cuisinart electric knive carved beautifully while it was working. Unfortunately, after fewer than five uses, the knife just quit. No smoke, no grinding noise, no warning -- just two minutes into the holiday turkey, the knife simply died. It still looks and feels brand new; it just won't work any more."
4,Slow start for cutting.,"When the knife 1st touches the surface of the food you are going to cut, it it takes more effort to get started. I primarly use my knife for carving rib-roast."
1,Good knife for a very short time,"I received this knife as a gift and was quite happy with its performance, for about fourteen months. Then it began to smell funny when I sliced anything at all resistant, such as bagels. This happened several times, over the next month, before the knife simply stopped working at all. This knife was refurbished, which I hadn't realized meant the warranty was for only 3 months. Cuisinart offered to replace it for $50, which is about the price of two knives if I replace it with another brand, which is what I intend to do. I had thought Cuisinart was the top brand but obviouly I was mistaken. We've had several electric knives, made by other companies, and this one gets the prize for having the shortest life. I wish I'd read the reviews posted by other customers, who had similar problems, before asking for this particular electric knife."
4,Great knife but lacks a storage case,This knife is by far the best electric knife I've ever owned. It cuts razor-thin slices of meat very quickly (so everything stays warm). It also cuts bread evenly without pulling or pushing the bread with the motion of the knife. (Two separate sets of knives)The only drawback I found is that it lacks a storage case. The LAST thing I need is another item on my kitchen counter - I barely have room as it is. I ended up using the plastic storage case from my old electric knife to store the new one (in a cupboard). If the Cuisinart knife came with a storage case I would have given it 5 stars.
4,Good Electric Knife,"I've only used this knife a couple of times, but I am very happy so far. I've sliced brisket, turkey and bread.The only negatives are that the cord management system is just stuffing the cord behind the cheap plastic fold-out stand. I will probably end up drilling a hole in the stand to mount it to the wall and add a hook to hang the cord out of the way.I have several Cuisinart appliances and continue to buy that line because I believe they produce better quality than a lot of the other brands.This knife is quite a bit more expensive than most of the other choices, but I'm a firm believer that in two years I won't remember the cost, but I will remember the quality -- and this knife will still be under warranty."
3,Cuisinart CEK-40 Electric Knife,The two blades do not stay hooked to one anotherDifficult to attach/dismantle blades without risking injury. I had a Sunbeam Electric knife for 16 years which I liked better. They are no longer available in the USA.
2,thumb down,I purchased the Cuisinart CEK-40 for my husband for father's day. It's a great knife as far as speed goes but with all the carving he's done on turkey's and roast's here lately the knifes have gotten out of shape and now just don't work well at all.
3,Recommend knife,I bought this knife in November and used it to carve up the turkey worked well and what it was intended for. It is a light duty knife not heavy duty one so if your slaughtering hogs this would not be the electric knife for you. This knife met my expectations for the price.
4,Nice knife to have on hand...,Works well for me so far. I purchased it to cut up cabbage for sauerkraut. Not great for that application but works well on meats.Jay
1,Loser Knife,"I bought this knife for myself and my sister. At Christmas dinner my sister asked me to carve the turkey and handed me a regular knife, telling me that the electric knife is unusable. She told me that she used this electric knife a couple of times but that the blades kept falling out. As it turns out, I had the same experience. When it worked it worked well but that didn't last long. I especially liked the security blade lock so that you couldn't accidentally turn it on. I have since purchased a new electric knife of a different brand and will see how well it works. If it works okay, I will also replace my sister's knife so that next Christmas I don't have to slice the meat off the turkey again with a dull knife!"
1,Died within a year,"Bought this knife less than a year ago. Used it maybe 20 times. Now, barely cuts through tender meat. I don't recommend it. Probably better to get the Black & Decker for 1/2 the price and replace it, if needed."
1,Needs help,"When it works, it is great. But I returned 2 of them after a short time because of it overheating or stopping totally."
1,Cuisinary Knife,"I cannot understand how Cuisinart sent a knife that only works on 110volts to my country, (Australia), that works on 240volt. Totally useless to me. To add insult to injury our Post Office wanted more than I paid in total to send this item back. I now have a good looking item sitting on the bench just to remind me of the stupidity of this whole exercise. Not happy."
2,what happened?,"I purchased this product approximately one year ago. It worked great, used it on turkey breasts, chicken, ham and steaks.A few months ago it suddenly stopped working. I have to unplug it, remove the blades and keep pressing the on/off switch.Eventually it goes back on but it is an annoying process and shouldn't have problems when it is so new."
1,Slipped gears,"I obtained the Cuisinart CEK-40 Electric Knife because of reputation of the company and familiarity with previous products. I liked the design, comfort of the handle and combination knife blades. My first use was slicing two loaves of bread with the bread knife. The bread was a somewhat dense whole wheat, but the gears stripped before I finished the second loaf. It has a great design but is poorly built."
5,Cuisinart Electric Knife a Winner,"I purchased an Oster 2803 electric knife based on the recommendations arising out of an America's Test Kitchen electric knife testing segment. I had previously owned a Cuisinart CEK-40 electric knife with the two sets of cutting blades but it was getting tired after a lot of heavy use and I thought the Oster would be the best choice to replace it. I was wrong. The Oster tended to tear rather than cut sour dough round loaves, a staple in my kitchen, and had great difficulty cutting through the bottom crust of the loaf. It was nothing special on meat and in fact I went back to using my regular cutting knives for carving meat and poultry. I bought another Cuisinart CEK-40 and discarded the Oster and have never looked back. The Cuisinart works great on meat and on bread and cuts the round sour dough loaves with ease, including the bottom crust. I would not recommend the Oster but I highly recommend the Cuisinart CEK-40."
1,very disappointed,"bought this knife cuisinart was a durable high quality knife , was i ever wrong used it 6 or 8 times and knife quit fileting to top it off i;ve tried twice to contact them with not so much of a hello from them geeeeeeeez THANKS for very expensive lesson"
4,Cuisnart CEK-40 Electric Knife,"I purchased this electric knife because my previous cuisinart knife had a bad switch, and you cannot get repairs for an electic knife."
2,CUISINART ELECTRIC KNIFE,"IT JUST DIDN'T WORK, I RETURNED IT TO AMAZON; IT WAS DEFECTIVE. AND, I EVEN LOOKED IT UP IN A CONSURMER'S REPORT TYPE OF BOOK."
1,Have not received this item yet,can't review don't have as yet..................not a plesant experience
1,poor service,"This was the poorest service i ever received from anyone, i ordered the knife on 12/25/06 and received it on 2/20/07 do you except me to buy anything from you in the future."
1,Poor quality control,This thing lasted almost a week before it broke. Now it just kind of makes a grinding noise and stops when I try to cut anything. Very poor quality control.
2,Poor Reliability,Did a good job carving turkey when first used. Motor failed to work the second time I tried to use it. Cannot recommend it. Removed comment about cutting frozen meat 12/3/11
4,Cuisinart CEK-40 Electric Knife,"This is still the best electric knife available. When the motor of my last one burnt up, I bought a Hamilton Beach, which broke during the second use, and would not cut anything more solid than an egg yolk without jamming. Even though the Cusinart knife motor burns hot, it works well. Generally, I have found the life of these products is about two years at the most if you are using it regularly."
1,consistently BAD,"I was given this Cuisinart Electric Knife less than a year ago after my mother bought one for her own kitchen. Within the first three months of occasional use, the trigger started malfunctioning so that it wouldn't turn on consistently. Within a few weeks of mine malfunctioning, my mother's started doing the same thing. Apparently this is a design flaw in the knife's trigger switch. When it works, it cuts well but there's no joy in repeatedly pressing a switch and never knowing for sure IF it will work. NOT worth the aggravation."
1,Cuisinart CEK -40 Electric Carving Knife,"Even having checked with Amazon that this item was 220v 50/60hz for use in Ireland, and having been assured that it was, when it arrived low and behold it was 110v 60hz. Needless to say I was more than dissapointed. Due to the high shipping cost it is not worth returning the item,so I am looking for a step down transformer now !!! Amazon were kind enough to refund my money."
2,electric knife,"I have this electric knife and am replacing it with a different brand. It is very bulky to operate for a woman, a little to large to hold. Also, the switch is made of cheap plastic and broke after a few uses. We hold it together with a rubber band."
1,Watch your fingers,"I was rather surprised when I plugged in the electric knife and it immediately started going. The switch on the handle which includes special lock-safe had no effect.In addition, the knives did not lock flush into the handle. I would guess that this is a manufacturing defect. If you buy this product, please assume that the knife will be cutting the instance that you plug it into the wall and save your fingers. As advertised, the knives are very sharp and will cut well."
1,This knife is garbage,Don't buy it unless your cutting Jello. Its junk. Cuisinart should be embarrassed.I bought the Cuisinart CEK-40 Electric Knife for cutting our annual turkey. The gears became more and more stripped towards the end of the first turkey. I exchanged it for a new one and it cut out on the second use occasionally working and was completely unusable on our third year for the same reason. A stripped gear! The motor keeps running at a louder pitch but the knife stops moving. There is a plastic gear part on the inside that easily becomes stripped on this unit.!!Any good reviews were either written when the unit may have had better parts or after the customers first use!!I've blacklisted the Cuisinart brand from our kitchen because of this product. Test your products Cuisinart! My respect for your products has been greatly lowered.
1,Not worth money!,"I've had this knife less than six months and it just stopped working. I've only used it to slice bread, nothing else, and really loved it when it was working. Now, I'm forced to use a bread slicing knife which is very much a hassle for me, as I do not have great strength in my hands. I'm getting another electric knife but it certainly won't be made by Cuisinart, although all of their other products that I own are just fantastic! I am SO disappointed in this product!"
1,Disappointed,On it's second use the linkage that moves the blades broke leaving the motor to spin freely. Very light weight mechanism.
2,Noisy,This knife is noisy. Had a 20 year old electric knife that had a better handle and was half as loud. I was hoping for a huge improvement to the old knife but it feels like I have a power tool. The cutting is ok and gest the job done but sometimes I just want to shut if off because it's so loud.
1,Warning,"I have owned two of these knives and both, in a short amount of time, stopped working. I would not recommend purchasing this knife."
5,Cuisinart CEK-40 Electric Knife,"This is a very good knife blades very sharp,you can slice a home made loaf of bread in a heart beat.I have sliced a 10 pound brisket with the meat blade,was able to slice thin and fast.Dose not tear the meat up like some I have used,I would recommend this knife to any one."
4,cuisinart electric knife is very good,"I enjoy my Cuisinart electric knife very much. It is easy to operate and clean, and has plenty of power for most slicing jobs."
1,Dead Knife,Loved this knife at first but then....after maybe 5-6 uses it died during use. I had been cutting a 4lb brisket and it was too much for the measly motor. The handle got hot halfway through the job and it just stopped. I won't purchase another.
2,Great knife until the 4th time we used it.,"This knife worked great but then the 4th time we went to use it, it did not work. Jiggling the blades around made it work once but then it quit again. My wife was very unhappy when she needed this for Thanksgiving and it didn't work. Maybe we got a dud but I would not buy another one and roll the dice on it."
2,Burned up!!,"From the day I bought this knife it put out an electrical burning smell but it always worked fine. Well, I was cutting a loaf of semi-frozen bread and it started smoking!! Really Cuisinart?? And just after the three year warrantee ended. POS! The last one I owned lasted twenty years. This ""top of the line"" just over three. Don't waste your $$."
2,disappointed/cheap but overpriced chinese junk,way overpriced. not very well made. trigger going bad. time to throw it out and get a different chinese-made piece of crap.
5,Ad does not state the knife is not correct voltage for Australia,"I was distressed when the Cuisinart knife arrived as it not meant for using in my country. Australia needs 220volt, the knife is 120volt. As I have other Cuisinart products I use regularly and like, it was a genuine mistake. At further expense I purchased a transformer to enable me to use the knife. I think it should be clearly stated in the description as to what Countries it can be used in. No way would I have ordered the item if I had known that. However, now I have bought a transformer I must say it is a brilliant electric knife. But I do think Amazon have to be more specific in advertising electrical goods, for sale around the world, and make their staff aware of the world voltage standards."
4,Great and fast teacher,"This little book is well worth the buy. It shows you the needed information fast. If you are searching for answers, this is the one you need. Where other books go into the why and how in a more elaborate way, this book shows you the path in an easy way, like a picture book. It showed me some hidden features, which I now use every day.Great buy."
2,Mediocre,"This book is only 260 pages but it took me forever to finish it. Two boys, Brian and Gregory, are caught up in a strange game while visiting an uncle. They have adventures and meet strange creatures. Even now I cannot really remember or understand what the point of the game was. The boys' characters were very undeveloped. I had a hard time remembering which boy was which -- they seemed interchangable. The great ""ah hah!"" at the end was -- underwhelming. Anderson was aiming at a gothic and sinister atmosphere but Spiderwick Chronicles and of course Lemony Snicket do it better. I am glad some kids liked the book but there is better stuff out there for fantasy readers."
3,Anderson drops the ball...,"I must say that I had expected more from M.T. Anderson. I adored his previous titles and eagerly dug into ""The Game of Sunken Places."" I found ""The Game of Sunken Places"" to be clever but unfortunately rather self-indulgent (Fanta, indeed....)."
1,Idiotic,"What a tremendously silly book. Unless I've missed something, there are only two routes to getting what you want -- taking or asking. Taking implies force (the stick). Asking implies sales (the carrot). Shorris would have us to believe that we should march evolution backwards and start using the stick again. Shorris obviously feels guilt by his salesmanship and has a need to atone for past behavior. Rather than write a book, he should seek out a psychologist. It would be more effective."
5,"Strength, Look and durability of stainless!","This tough plastic drink mug is plenty durable. It can stand up to even the toughest abuse, or commute. I really love not only the lightness (even when filled) but the spill-proof as well! No one likes having hot coffee tumble out onto their work clothes, or legs for that matter.You can also show your patriotic side with the emblazoned flag on the cup. If you are looking for a sturdy, light alternative to stainless commuter mugs try this out. Heck, it's backed by a lifetime warranty, and it's Tupperware! How can you go wrong?"
3,"Nice subject, but book has more fluff than guts","I bought this for my engineer friend, but when I received it, I realized that the book is very light on technical info and could not give it to him. This book is more for the general public than for someone who really wants to know more about the actual structure. I found the images to be more centered around the men who erected the steel rather than the actual structure. Overall, the book seemed more topical than a case study on the Disney Concert Hall, and when you are talking about such a intricate structure, it seems like an injustice to not fully cover the topic."
3,Wait a Minute,"Michael Webb is arcitectural critic for a magazine owned by the publisher of Garcetti's book. Fair's fair.This is a nice book, but the photography is well, mediocre. The building is astounding."
4,New Minimalist Sound Masterpiece,"A reissue of the 2nd album by this German electroacoustic composer (the 1st being the utterly amazing ""un peu de neige salie"" on Table of the Elements). 3 long sound works dedicated to Jim O'Rourke, Richard Long & Giancarlo Toniutti. Beautiful sounds of computer-aided & field recorded ""high-pitch tones"" & ""lo-end disruptions"". Bernhard Guenter definitly has his place in the sound universe along with such composers as Luc Ferrari, Pierre Henry and Bernhard Parmegiani."
3,"Good book, but lacks a key content","This is a great book that gives good insights on business acumen and common sense. Where the book falters, however, is at the central theme of the book. He claims ""selling"" is what they don't teach you at Harvard Business School. It is obvious that the author does not know whole lot about selling either. He tries to teach sales techniques that are amateurish and perhaps what they DO teach at Harvard Business School. Otherwise, it is a good book."
3,Is this book still relevant,I think in the internet age this book could use and update. Things move much faster than they did in 1988
3,Didn't exactly set me on fire..,"Mr. McCromick is indeed a great motivational writer/ speaker, but in this book, there is no new information that one doesn't already have by using common sense. No disrespect to Mark but they probably don't teach common-sense at Harvard Business School because there is a great possibility that the guys who make it to HBS already possess enough of it."
3,Indeed a book that deserves to become a University text ...,"... to fairly and squarely remind students of the limits of University education. McCormack (whose craft is business, not writing) would have done better to use a professional writer to get his ideas across."
2,"Clever Title, Disappointing Content","I eagerly made my way through this book, in search of insights that might live up to the intriguing title of this book. What I found disappointed me: rather blasé anecdotes that seemed to be saying, ""Look at me... see what I've done? Aren't I something?"" Mark McCormack has obviously achieved great success, but his musings left me unfulfilled just the same. The basic premise of this book (listen to and take care of people, and beware arrogance) is sound, but for hard-hitting, meaty commentary, I'd look elsewhere."
4,Notes from a Street Smart Executive,"There are many books the shelves for the seasoned executive wanting to enhance his or her skills, but very few for the new executive crop.Mark McCormack gives straightforward, no nonsense advise on the subtly of business that is not taught in ANY business school. The reader gets invaluable insights into the world of ""the street smart executive"" and how to immediately improve their people skills. While some of McCormack's ""notes"" may seem obvious to an experienced executive, the lessons are great examples of how interpersonal dealings can either make or break a business relationship. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to save the pain of trial by fire as they make their way through the corporate world. This is a must read for anyone wanting to be a ""street smart executive"".John M. Vanderslice"
2,"What is bigger, national debt or author's EGO??","The book is full of nonsense that should be simple common sense to anyone that has worked in the business world. Mostly this book is a chance for the author to talk of his many ""high level"" meetings and for him to boast about all of the execs and sports figures that he knows. This book is rather entertaining, but you will not gain much from it in the way of business or management knowledge."
1,Very disappointed,"Antidotal stories, personal opinions, and somewhat painful to listen too. It was a great premise, but the delivery isn't very good. I wish I had saved my money and not purchased this book"
4,"Entertaining & enlightening ""journey through time"".","The author travels throughout the Mediterranean, Anglo-Saxon Europe and Africa, as well as the Canary Islands. You feel as if you're there traveling right along with him. OK, he's not always detailed, it's more a travelogue than a scientific examination, but, along with the fun, there's lots of historic information and mysteries I learned about that I didn't know about before. The book stirred up my interest in Atlantis and led me to want to do more study on the subject."
3,lost cities of atlantis and ancient europe and mediterranean,i find it very intersting and it's indispensable for every body how want enter in the next century
1,blah,too many people out like this loser get your own style and dont write a review on yourself even tho u dont have any fans. This guy is a 50 cent fan btw if that tells you anything. Looks like a cracked out NE-YO haha
5,Perfect for those pesky onions left in the fridge.,"This is neat! These hang on your the shelves in your fridge. They are too cute. But more than just that. They are very useful for the left over onion that you need to keep, but do not want stinking up your fridge. My mom uses hers for keeping her grated cheese in. It hangs where you can see it so you will not forget about what you've put in it. It is also good for keeping the second half of the grapefruit in until the next day. It stores tomatoes, oranges, lemons, or anything that you have just a small amout of to keep cold."
3,Borrow from a friend,"This book was not that great. The summary, was not at all what the book was about. There were numerous typos, no plot, and the story seemed choppy.Not at all what I expected."
4,A good read!,"I just finished ""Mixed Messages"" and it was really good. I ordered this book 4 months ago, and I finally read it. I really enjoyed it. Nice job, Ms. Williams! I am looking forward to her next novel."
3,Cute teacher gift but a little small,"I am sure I would have known this prior to purchasing this if I had read the product description better, but it was a little smaller than I had thought it might be. I added some other things to it for the gift as it would not be sufficent to give alone."
5,Worth Every Penny!,"I had a professor in college that made us read this for our ""Teaching Writing"" class. And, I am forever grateful that she did. This is an excellent reference for any class that is going to study or work on writing. There are so many ideas of what to do, but more than that, there is so much motivation within these pages. While reading it, I would get so excited about what I would do in my next lesson plan. Whether you want your class to write a multi-genre paper or not, this is a great book for any English teacher to read at least once! Even if you teach a subject that is not English, this would still be a fantastic reference. In our class, we had to write a multi-genre research paper. This would be an amazing project in a history class, or art, or any class where you want your students to be more creative with their writing!"
3,Cell Phone Battery,The new battery I received appears to be a factory original which is good. The problem is it will not hold a charge any longer than the old battery I was replacing. I can't say for sure that it is the battery or if the problem is with my phone but because of the cost of shipping to return it and get a replacement I am in a no-win situation. The battery arrived on time and packaged well. I just don't think I can come out ok on this and will probably just buy a new phone.
4,Nice item..,"I needed a new battery for my phone since my didn't last a day without being back on the charger. So I bought this replacement and it now last for a few days. Great price and a nice product, I would highly recommend."
4,Great Buy,"This certainly does not look like a $4.00 hat, the quality is great along with the fit. It fits much like the polo hats but sure does not cost like one! I ordered the blue and it turned out a little lighter than the picture depicted, but I am happy nonetheless. It shipped quickly and I will order more in the future!"
1,DVD Recorder doesn't last,"The Magnavox MSR90D6 that I bought a year ago has worked sporatically at best. Now, after a year, the clock will not set. I don't think Magnavox got all of the ""bugs"" out of this unit before they put it on the shelf. If you are considering buying this unit, get a LONG extended warranty, you will need it."
3,I like this recorder,"I have 3 of them. I found them easy to install and set up, and editing a disc is relatively easy. However, on one of them, the clock no longer works, so I record manually rather than setting up a timer. That's a little annoying. I'm looking to replace it with another, and it's important to know whether a dvd recorder has a tuner. The hook-up to a cable box and tv is very different if the recorder doesn't have a tuner, so I would recommend getting one with a tuner. This model produces a good picture and is easy to use. The remote and the keys on it are small."
1,Not Happy,"I have had this recorder for less than a year, last night it stopped working completely. Will not power on. It was a great recorder while it worked, not so much anymore. Should have lasted a lot longer than this."
2,You can do better!,"I purchased this and it worked properly for 13 months until the clock mechanism stopped working, which rendered the programmable recording functionality useless. It still plays DVDs, but obviously I can get a DVD player for less than and DVD recorder. The unit is slow... in every aspect and really isn't that great.In closing, if your buying this to record TV you can do better. Go for a hard drive based recorder that can give you > 30 hours of media. This thing can only give you 6 at best."
2,Unreliable,"I bought this unit in early 2007. It operated flawlessly for almost a year. In the last month it has become very sporadic. I am unable to finalize a recorded DVD about half the time now. The unit displays an ""Error xxx"" message very early in the finalize process."
4,Love This DVD!,"I am a new drummer, and a HUGE fan of punk rock in general and the Ramones in particular. Marky gives grooves from simple to ""oh man"" and fills to match. It really is a great beginner's DVD, and I use it far more than the other DVD's I've bought for learning purposes. I only give it 4 stars because Marky is no television personality...so...yeah, there is that."
3,"Oh Marky, you're so funny...","So I got this DVD thinking,""who better to teach me how to be a cool punk drummer than Mary Ramone."" The DVD showed up, I got all excited, I put it in, and........ nothing. Well, I guess you can't say nothing, but as far as instructional... forget it. Entertaining? sure... we'll go with that. I found myself laghing at the DVD instead of learning anything. If someone came to me and said... ""HEY, I was thinking of getting Marky's DVD to LEARN to play the drums.""..... would I recommend it? NOPE! But to a Ramones fan would I say ""Hey pick up Marky's drum DVD it's kind of funny."" YES!"
4,Great for cars or planes,"Thought this is a fun personal entertainer, it's fun for a group of people as well. It tests your knowledge and amazes as if magic. I had the original game and this is fun too. Great stocking stuffer."
4,I love Roses,It was very hard to find any kind of rose cologne online. I ordered this and really like it. It is very strong though so only one spray will do.
2,Old lady,"This scent was too strong. I was hoping for a light rose scent, but this smelled heavy and very old lady like."
1,Smells Horrible,after reading all the great reviews i figured i should give this perfume a try. especially since it was so cheap. big mistake. it STINKS!!!!! i normally dont rate things i buy on amazon but i had to this time.
5,roses delight,"fairly priced and nicely comprised for a cheepy - not complex, a straightforward single note impression - dry and slightly sweet, and not at all spicy"
5,Awesome Scent,The scent of this perfume is awesome!!! I will last all day and you will smell like roses all day. It's not overpowering yet others will notice this fabulous scent.
1,Toxic Smell,"I'm rarely, if ever, sensitive to perfume, but this perfume is one of those exceptions. I've tried wearing it on more than one occasion, and every time I've ended up with a headache. Also, the rose scent is sharp and unnatural."
1,I can't stand it!,"I did buy it severals months ago without testing before. And when I received this, I couldn't breathe because of it's dark strong smell. I had a headache immediately !"
4,Really nice!,"I bought this on a whim after purchasing a few other perfumes I had high hopes for. While this isn't quite the scent I'm looking for, it is really nice. Before I opened the box I could smell roses. I was excited. I spritzed a few times around my wrists and in the air. When I pulled my wrists up to sniff, I thought it smelled terrible! Like a potent, fragrant, woodsy stench, or something. However, when I pulled them away from my face, it reverted to the lovely smell of roses. So, for me, I can't stand it too close to my face, too strong I guess. But a couple spritz around my torso and it's great. I smell roses wherever I go."
3,Item mis labelled on amazon,"Note that amazon.com title for the product isTea Rose Perfume By Perfumers Workshop 4.0 oz.This is not perfume, it is Eau De Toilette."
2,Is that ammonia???,"I really think that this perfume smells like ammonia after a while. At first it smells like roses, then like cat pee. Yuck. I've tried it several times to make sure that it was not just a weird fluke, and it really does remind me of cat pee. It is like one of the low notes in the perfume smells like ammonia. I also don't think it is just that the fragrance does not mix with my body chemistry, because it does the same thing on clothes."
2,"A Rose Is A Rose, or may be not?","Remembered this lovely fragrance from my grandmother, who was the best-smelling woman around. My mother told me that she wore the ""original"" Perfumers Workshop Tea Rose.After receiving this product I can only surmise that either this is not the ""original"", is a different Perfumers Workshop, or they have changed their formula.This smells very artificial, almost plastic-y. When you spray it on your arm, the scent is completely gone in an hour or so (probably good in this case).Fortunately it was not an expensive product, so it wasn't a great loss. I miss the lovely fragrance that my grandmother wore, and hope that somewhere out there it still exists."
3,For the Mature Adult,"I am 29 years old. I will say, this fragrance is possibly more suited to a more mature adult. The fragrance is very true to the scent of an actual rose...but...there is a tinge of, something. Sorta smells like, nail polish remover somehow. I wouldnt return it at all, its an OK, prefume. But I wont be a repeat customer for Tea Rose. :-("

2,Terrible Picture Quality,I am a huge Steve Morse fan but I have to say that the picture quality on this Blu-ray disc is terrible. I'm going to return it.
4,Jimi Still Making Records,"This is incredible. 30 years after his death Jimi is still spitting out records, box sets, and autographed guitars!On January 1st, 2001 he will have a press meeting and announce that he is still dead and is working on new material for his next album and have a world tour to support it."
5,The Best Guitar ever,"As my title says, Jimi's one was, is, and will always be the best guitar ever. In The Jimi Hendrix Experience boxset, yaou have the possibility of listening to a great artist in the whole faces he had. That's when you discover why he is called the great Guitarist ever..."
3,"Not really a ""Box Set""","If you're looking for a comprehensive collection of Hendrix recordings, you'll just have to keep waiting cause this isn't it. While the fidelity of the recordings has never sounded better, (including some much improved remixes) calling this a box set is somewhat deceiving. Hendrix released three studio albums and one live recording while alive, and several of the highlights of those recordings are not here. There's no Castles Made of Sand, Manic Depression, Love or Confusion, May This Be Love, Crosstown Traffic, Remember, etc. That being said, there is some stuff here for a Hendrix collector that is dying to have some new/slightly different material to add to their collection."
5,"Wow! At a loss for words, so just plain.... WOW!","As mentioned, this is not for the person new to Hendrix. There's plenty of 'greatest hits' packages for that. With that said, if you are a fan you absolutely MUST have this box set. I just got it and it blew me away! Some really incredible guitar as you'd expect from Hendrix. Several tunes that I had not heard before, but are already favorites. An instrumental ""Bold as Love"", a scorching version of ""Room Full of Mirrors"", ""Catfish Blues"" and ""Come Down Hard on Me"" are just a few of the incredible songs on this set. Like I said, this is for Hendrix fans. Much better than the other collections of odds and ends that are available. This one has mostly polished numbers and great live cuts. I dumped it into my IPod and have been in Hendrix heaven since getting it in the mail. Buy it!! Read the other reviews for more details. I think everyone gave it 5 stars... should be 20 stars since all 4 discs are incredible."
4,the master lives on,"being a fan of jimi's since a teenager,and having lost some of his precious lp's and cd's in a fire,you know i was truely excited when this set came out.i will admit just as other reviewers have done that this set does have a few flaws.but the sheer genious that is jimi just permiates everywhere!if you want to hear power trio material,or r&b flavored rock and roll,or progressive rock with a jazz flavor it is here.this set may not be for everyone,but for collectors and serious jimi fans,this is a must!check out the awe inspiring blues on red house.you've never heard blues guitar like this!"
5,Awesome box set!,"You might have thought they'd have milked Jimi's works completely over the last 30 years... but they came up with an awesome set with this one. Trust me-- if you're a Hendrix fan, you MUST have this collection. It's simply amazing. I couldn't begin to use all the superlatives it deserves. Buy it!"
3,"Though Good in Parts, Hendrix family falls short","I, like many Hendrix fans, was really looking forward to this set. And if you're a really big fan, you already have the import Polygram releases of Isle of Wight, In the West, and Band of Gypsies. When you trim away the re-release material, alternate takes that sound nearly identitcal, there is maybe 2 cds worth of gems. And gems they are!!!As usual, the Hendrix family serves up the bare minimum instead of going the extra mile, which would be deal with the reissuing of albums like In the West correctly and not pawn them off, again, in a box set that had huge potential."
5,Still the greatest !,"After all these years Jimi Hendrix is still one of the greatest guitar players to grace the Earth ! This box set, sanctioned byt the Hendrix estate, is amazing. New takes (never before released) and previus cuts come through with amazing clarity and style. Even today more than 30 years after his passing his music proves that he still lives in the hearts of all music fans. The booklet enclosed with the box set details every cut and has some close intimate photos. If yo are a Jimi Hendrix fan, if you want to learn more about Jimi, if you want to hear some amazing songs with blues then this is for you. Don't pass it up !"
2,I got the Mac version,These usually work well for my needs but the little note about it being for a mac was not very prominent on the site and I ordered it by mistake.
3,"So Far, So Good","After 3 days into the Networking Essentials volume, I'm half-way through. I agree that there is a bit of non-essential information, but this can help broaden your horizons...I don't want to just pass the tests (as some MCSE courses suggest), but want to KNOW what I'm actually doing as well. We'll see how the first test goes."
1,"Lacking tested material, but, still looks good on the shelf.","I have to admit - It is typical MicroSoft. T.A.U.I. Technically Accurate Useless Information. I dove into this set with the belief that MCSE is a MicroSoft Certification based on MicroSoft's pricipals (point of view) to take a MicroSoft test. Ironically alot of the material on the test is not even grazed in these books. The Networking essentials doesn't even cover 30% of the material that you are actually tested on. I am exceptionally dissappointed with the product, Especially after the price."
2,Check First!,"I purchased this training kit mainly because it contained a 120 day evaluation copy of NT. I thought that working with NT would be much more beneficial than just reading about NT. I didn't get very far into it before I ran into some problems with the software. From what I did read, the information provided seems relatively well organized and informative. There is a caveat.If you're thinking about buying this training kit because it contains an evaluation copy of NT (like I did) I would STRONGLY suggest that you make sure your system can run NT Server. It's MORE than the processor or the amount of RAM you have. Check Microsoft's web site for a complete hardware compatibility list.If you ignore this warning and have problems with the enclosed software, don't expect much (if any) help from Microsoft."
2,There are better ways to get your MCSE,"Don't get us wrong, it's not that these books are terrible. It's just that if you're going to spend this kind of money on a set of books, they better be all you need. Sadly, the Training Kits lack much of the essential knowledge needed to pass the exams. We would recommend purchasing other books like Sybex, Exam Cram, New Riders and Alan Carter's book depending on the exam. Check out MCSETutor.com for a more detailed breakdown."
4,The Softwares alone worth the $$$,Let's get straight to the point !!!The included CDs which contain NT workstation & server 120 days trial alone worth the $$ already. Show me a training kit that include these trial OS ?
1,Bill does it again.,"I have to say, if I wasn't such a fan of microsoft, I'd defect to pc-dos. These books fall into the typical microsoft arsenal of useless products for usefull tasks. I have taken and passed all four core tests. First I failed after studying these books and then I passed using a few others. Mind you these books do in fact cover almost everything, which would be great if you could take the books with you for the tests. Unfortunately, the amount of useless (non test related) information is so large you windup remembering all the needless information. If this was a reference manual I would have given it five stars.... but this falls way short of a training and test preperation manual, which it was intended to be. Big thumbs down Bill."
2,Art History major gives his two pennies,"So I bought this book after graduating with my BFA in art history and was looking forward to learning something new about this subject. Unfortunatly I never took a class on this particular subject and I feel like I knew more art that I could have put into the book than they did. I also feel I could have said something new about the art included. Reproductions are great, but I think this book would have been strengthened if maybe it was broken down into more than one book so each subject could have been dealt with properly. As it is I would say that this book should have been re-named as a few pages on each of the topics the authors find slightly spooky."
3,Fun for couple of minutes,"Purchased toys for nephews for xmas, after an hour of playing they were bored with it."
4,pretty cool,For a star wars/transformers nerd its pretty cool.. but it's more for collection than anything.. whats cooler is I got mine at target for 15 bucks!! I should have bought 2
4,lots of fun!,"well i guess if you never played with transformers as a kid you don't understand how they work. you really have to pop them hard into place. if you don't, it WILL fall apart. and you have to push HARD to get them to make certain positions, etc. i can see how those not familiar might either be concerned if they push too hard it will break or think they have it locked in place but they really don't. it may take some tinkering to get it right if you aren't very familiar with the concept.otherwise, for us (both my husband and i loved transformers as a kid and star wars) this was lots of fun to put together! and my son has gotten HOURS of play and enjoyment. my only complaint is that i can't readily find replacement gun parts. my son took the falcon over to a friends where there was a 2 year old- who shot it and lost the parts. :(but even without the shooter parts, my son (who is 4.5) ADORES this thing. worth every cent!"
1,educational is a good word to describe this toy,"Horrible, flimsy, piece of crap with awesome potential. My son wanted this toy and literally within5 minutes I broke it trying to open chubacas arms. Totally ruined. Lesson learned. He still has fun trying to figure it out but that bad boy is never going to become a space ship again."
5,GREAT GIFT,MY 6 YEAR OLD GRANDSON PLAYED ENDLESSLY WITH THIS TOY.THE SOUNDS WERE GREAT AND THEY WERE VERY INTERTAINING.FOR A STAR WARS BUFF LIKE MY LIAM..IT WAS PERFECT.
2,Does not do the job,"It is very difficult to get the blade on this can opener to pierce cans to initiate the opening process. This limits its use, particularly for larger soup cans, where often the old manual can opener needs to be used. I am unimpressed and would not recommend this item."
1,Not a great can opener,"I completely agree with the reviewer from Portland. It is very difficult to get the can lined up properly and the cutting started.Also, this unit produces a particularly sharp, jagged and nasty lid which will slice you like a razor if you are not careful.I still use it but am looking for something else."
2,Can Opener Review,"The service was great. The can opener, however was not so great. It was difficult to get the opener to begin cutting and when it was finished, it dropped the can on the countet top.The company readily approved a return. I have not received a refund yet, but I am confident I wil receive one soon.It was a pleasent experience even though the product was not very good."
1,Buy anything else you find,"I have been putting up with this can opener since Dec 2001. The longer I have it the more I hate it. It has two problems:1)It spills the contents of the can every time it's used.2) The can top ends up with the most ragged cut you can imagine.It does reliably grab the can and open it, and if you don't mind the problems mentioned above you may be satisfied."
1,waste of money,"i got this product because it was suppose to be a housing with everything include, it is actually a cover, something that you can buy in a different web site for no more than $4.00. Got full housing with tool from ebay for $14.00 ( the same amount of money that i waste here for a simple cover), recomend don't buy it."
4,Excellent way to introduce children to orchestral music,"""Peter and the Wolf"" is, of course, designed to introduce young people to the orchestra by telling a story using musical instruments. This collaboration between the European Chamber Music Orchestra and the Spitting Image puppets features Sting as the narrator. The fanciful treatment will appeal to older children as well as the very young--although some youngsters might find the wolf a little scary. Includes others of Prokofiev's work (""Variations on a Hebrew Theme"") with the characters of Peter and the Grandfather to anchor the fantasy. (Some parts may be a little ""dark"" for children under five.)"
4,brilliant production,"Not sure why this isn't available on DVD, but it's very entertaining. In addition to Peter and the Wolf, there are two additional Prokofiev pieces, which are a little confusing to follow (no actual plot) but actually quite nice once you figure out what's going on. But a great production of Peter and the Wolf. My 5-year-old loves it."
5,Peter and the Wolf--GREAT!!!,"The condition was EXCELLENT!! It came in a plastic covering thing, just like new. Thank you very much!"
5,Awesome Quality and Strength!,"Finally a backpack that my 16 yr old son did not destroy within a month. In fact, he has had this backpack for most of the school year and will be using it again next year. I can't get over the weight that this thing can hold without ripping or falling apart. It comes home stuffed with books every night. This backpack has saved me money since I have not had to make 3 trips to Walmart for new ones like I did last year. I also own an Ogio golf bag which is top quality as well."
3,I so wished I liked this one...,"The tips are fine... the unit that holds the filling is not the right material. I don't know if it needs to be made of a different material, or vented...or a different shape but....Tupperware usually comes out with some real winners. In theory this should have been one. It just falls short of the promise.Until they work out the design flaws (and I will be looking forward to that very much) I will stick to pastry tips and a zip loc bag...which works fine and doesn't need clean-up.Three stars for the concept though"
2,Not on the ball,"I love the concept of this decorator ball, easy to store and clean... but the frostings don't come out easily unless it's totally full, which makes for a lot of waste.The idea is great, but just doesn't work well. Stick with the old fashioned bag."
4,good concept,this porduct is very invovative but require more modifcation in plastic matrials to be more flexbile
1,Lousy,"This shelving system is very unsteady and the wire shelving does not allow small items to be placed standing. For the steadiness, it should have adjustable or rubber ends to the legs. I guess I should not have been surprised, considering it was priced so economically. If it is going to be used for towels and the like, it is worth buying. Otherwise, shop elsewhere."
4,Great buy,"This freestanding, over the toilet bathroom shelving is light weight and easy to put together. Very nice looking unit for the price. Can also be anchored to wall if you want."
1,unsteady and cheaply made,Zenith 2501W freestanding space saver over-the-toilet shelving system is below par..don't buy it! Instructions incomplete and freestanding should mean stands on it's own - without benefit of screwing to a wall...not so with this product.
3,"Flimsy, but functional","This shelving system provided much needed storage for towels and other bath items at a very reasonable price. It is very flimsy, so I would not recommend it for a bath area where children could do the damage that only children can do."
2,Zenith 2501W,"Hard to assemble, wobbly when it is assembled--very disappointing. We will have to secure it to a wall so it won't fall over into the toilet. Not happy with it."
4,good for the $$,"While this is not the 'highest' quality space saver you will find and would not be the ideal one for long term, heavy use, it is perfect for a kid's or guest bathroom. That, coupled with the incredibly low price, makes this space saver perfect! Additionally, it sets up quickly, and looks presentable. I would recommend getting some plastic liners for the shelves or some thin plywood/paneling as they are wire, and thus it would help to stabilize your items. All in all I am very pleased with this purchase and believe it will serve my child through college when a job/money will afford an upgrade ;)"
3,Shaky,"at best. I had to place towels on the ""shelves"" so I could place things on them without them falling thru. I would not buy this again and I don't recommend it. It's just too precarious."
5,The test of time.,"There are some movies one sees as an adolescent that simly don't hold up upon reviewing later; Repo Man is not one of them. Whether you're a young punk rocker, a die hard sci-fi fan or simply an aging fart, Repo Man remains a joy to watch."
5,I Blame Society,I agreee. Repo Man is indeed the Best Film of All Time ...a Masterpiece (the best soundtrack too.)and then... BLAMMO..
1,i feel like amazon ripped me off on this one!,"i saw the release of the SE dvd announced and ordered it. after the fact i see that the only special bits are the tin box and a comic book about which i do not care the thx, the commentaries (SE lists as 4 separately but regular also lists 4 on a single line so they are likely the same) everything else remains the same so i spent $15 on packaging which i care nothing about ... but the original amazon announcement did not mention the regular edition release!sometimes it is the studio who rips us off (brazil followed by SE later, and the same for a couple of other movies of note) but when the reseller is doing it to suck us in i figure it is time to complain"
1,Bad acting and no plot at all,"This movie has nothing to recommend it. The actors can't act, the dialogue is inane and unbelievable, the photography is second-rate, the macho histrionics and constant cursing are unimpressive, and besides that, I don't think I liked this prole-trash very much. I watched this movie because of the high ""star"" ratings given in these reviews. BIG MISTAKE."
4,"""I don't want no commies in my car. No Christians either.""","Alex Cox sends up the Reagan era in a black comedy about car reposession. With a stellar soundtrack and lots of quotables, Cox is the precursor to the Coens and Tarantino. Cox sends up everything but the kitchen sink-suburban life, televangelism, nuclear fear, UFO conspiracies, commercialism, self help cults, and more I'm sure I missed here. Straight up lo-budget classic if you have a taste for irony and absurdity."
5,A rare treat,"I read a copy of Alex Cox's script for ""Repo Man"" a number of years ago in film school, and was amused at his running commentary in the margins about the Smurfs. His actual film is a total original, featuring some of the oddest characters, and lines, to populate a feature film (""A lot of guys ilke to watch their buddies ... I know I do."") Given his other films - Sid and Nancy, Straight to Hell, etc. - it's fair to rate Cox as something of a Nihilist. It works here, though. Plus you get a soundtrack full of 80s punk rock favorites."
4,Plate of Shrimp! A Metal Hand!,"This film is wonderful for about the first hour but the UFO dead aliens plot never really did it for me. What makes this movie a classic is the first hour where Otto, fed up with his life, finds his way into becoming a RepoMan. The dialogue of the ""Repo Code"" and the soundtrack (""doo-bee do wa wa say what yeah?"") put this film into a class by itself. I still consider it one of the best films of the 1980s."
4,Irradiated,"When I first saw this movie about 20 years ago I didn't know what to make of it. I was about thirty then. I still don't know, but I do know it has enough merit as a SciFi movie to deserve at least a rental. For someone to associate this as sexist, cruel, sadistic, unholy, or any other negative societal connotation is certainly understandable. It is probably those things because it was meant to be. I doubt saying Hannibal Lechter was a cannibal would surprise the author or director of ""Silence of the Lambs"". So trying to equate displays of anti-feminist, anti-christian, or anti-social behavior with intelligence is rather moot. The movie is what it is. You will love it or hate it probably. Imagine crossing ""Reservoir Dogs"" with ""Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" or ""Raising Arizona"" with ""Snatch"" and you begin to understand. You can't fit it in your genre specific box. So if you are open to sub-cultural wacky movies, you may be entertained."
1,"Digital Video Didn't Work, Can't Find Another Way to Complain","So instead, I'm forced to write a negative review. I did not see the video because I tried watching it on demand and it never loaded. Extremely disappointed!"
1,Repo Man,"Thank God I watched this instantly on Netflix therefore saving some money,Who's idea was this make Psuedopunk/Wanna-bee Billy Idol meets Bad Sci-Fi into a movie?the plot if there is any does not make sense.Half-way the movie does a 360 as Mean Gene would say To Macho Man,the Malibu along with the Repo'd Camaro are the only parts worth watching,there are not many cars to be ""Repo'd"",I actually enjoyed Night of the Comet to this,I would even prefer watching a 3am Cinemax Movie or Made For Tv movie than this.The acting is not there,by the description I would have thought it was about a Person who got into the Repo Business,But Alas even the netflix description or any others without giving it away would advise you what mess your getting into when you watch this,I believe this would be the cheech and chong/surfer/whoa set that would ""dig"" this movie,because someone sober and with all their faculties would not watch this,I made the mistake of doing so."
2,"Muddled, aloof.","A summary of events is a waste of time, suffice to say that the film is rife with eighties plot excess' and in-cohesiveness. The film, although quirky and periodically engrossing, is badly made and cobbled together with acting styles ranging from frenetic (the indistinguishable punk figures) to somnambulistic (Estevez). Most of the figures in 'Repo Man' are grating, none are memorable. A little of this watchable mess does- granted- go a long way, especially for eighties fringe culture enthusiasts.The DvD release's picture quality is acceptible, the sound quality is awful, muddy. Go for the DD 2.0 instead of the thinly expanded 5.1. track."
1,What the f*** is this???,"You got some mohawked broad kissing a woman's metal hand...sucking her fingers too,a crazy old man driving around in a car with some kind of atomic s*** in the truck,that makes people disolve when they open it,Emillo Estevez stealing cars for some crack snorting guy who hates Communists and Christians and a bunch of other bulls*** that doesn't make any sense whatsoever.I wasted an hour and 33 minutes of my life watching this crap-fest of a movie.I HIGHLY recommend that you don't do the same."
1,"Boring, gave me a major headache","This has got to be one of the dumbest, most deliriously boring flicks ever made. Heck, watching it gave me a massive headache. I'm known for liking really cheesy movies, but this one is just plain stinky."
1,"Scenes from TV version MISSING, but talked about!","Half the reason to buy the DVD, especially the commemorative edition, is to see the extra scenes. The comentary focuses on how great the extra scenes in the TV versions were, but are not part of this $50 DVD. I wish I had known this before my purchase.Wait until they issue a version with both the theater and TV versions."
2,Save Your Money,"Missed the mark badly. Deleted scenes would have been great. Problem is, a track called ""The Missing Scenes"" takes the strangeness out of the movie and reproduces it in an interview with the inventor of the neutron bomb and chops the deleted scenes up, mixes them up and misses a few for good measure. The transfer and audio is not sufficiently good enough to warrant buying this edition over some other edition. Buy the cheapest one available, skip this one. Focus Features-don't treat us like freaks! Some of us just want plain, run of the mill deleted scenes without the crap you like to splatter all over. There are fans who aren't rabid cultish fans."
5,Cut!,"I've loved Repo Man since the first time I saw it on late night cable. Repo man is a great film which I love to watch over and over. The characters have a raw/cold edge that are foreign and familiar at the same time.My only gripe is that a couple of scenes were edited out on the DVD. Although the scenes are not integral to the overall story, I knew I had missed something but wasn't sure exactly what at first.The one scene that that I really miss is where J. Frank Parnell talks about Lorna Doones and goes on about vending machine food being the perfect food. Is it insight into Frank's life - not having a life outside of long hours on the job or is it the radiation affecting his mind?Another scene cut is the one where Otto and Bud attack a pay phone with a sledge hammer to get some money. This scene is partially shown in the video trailer in the ""Extras"" section.It's an excellent film and I give it 5 stars, but I wish that they had not cut out the scenes."
1,Incomplete copy!,"The copy of this book that I bought, and am now returning, was incomplete: it ended at the bottom of page 288 in the middle of a sentence. Caveat emptor! Better yet, get a good used copy of the Early English Text Society original."
3,It Was Pretty Good,"This movie is pretty good for children, because it relates to fairytales but with Hello Kitty. The only reason I didn'y give it five stars, is because the graphics and characters are no where near as good as the movies made by the Sanrio Company; ""Mom Loves Me After All,"" ""Dream Theif,"" and ""Santa's Missing Hat."" The Sanrio-made movies are original and in my eyes, a lot better, but I still give this movie a thumb up."
5,A Collection from her heart to my heart.,Mrs. Cowman has obviously faced many trials during her lifetime. You can feel this through the incredible collection of writings that was dear to her heart. This book speaks directly to anyone who knows the reality of life and wants to be victorious through Christ. I am moved by each page and encouraged so completely. I read her works over and over.
3,"Love the product, don't like the name.","First off, there is nothing more convenient and helpful in the kitchen than Tupperware. So it is with a heavy heart that I must write this. I have a cousin who is ""a little person,"" and he was so offended at the name 6-PIECE CLASSIC SHEER MIDGETS SET TUPPERWARE that he went into a veritable depression. While visiting my house, he refused to eat leftovers. At first I found his behavior to be extreme, but he made a good point. What other slur would be deemed acceptible by a major manufacturer? He's right. The product should be renamed TUPPERWARE 6-PIECE CLASSIC SHEET LITTLE PERSON/DWARF SET TUPPERWARE to avoid this kind of pointless name calling. Little people have been marginalized for too long, and they're tax-paying citizens just like the rest of us. Beyond that complaint, however, I found the product very satisfactory. It keeps food fresh longer, and preserves flavor. Hence my profound ambivalence."
1,don't bother,"The net is flimsy, the sticks only about 18 inches long. I have 5 boys between 2 and 13 who have a skate rink in our yard to use They like to play Hockey for fun but we are better off buying old sticks at the thrift store...no one really likes the little plastic ones I bought."
3,"Too, too small","When they say 'mini', they're not kidding! I bought this for my 4yr old son's birthday and it's too small for him. He's average height and weight for his age. Three stars - it's a great set for smaller children. The sticks are durable and the net is well built - assembly a bit of a challenge. I bought larger sticks - we use the mini net and the ball."
2,Made for midgets!,"Buyer Beware! The item description does not give dimensions of the goal or sticks. The package arrived in the actual packaging - no brown box or wrapper, giving away contents - at Christmas time! - and the set is very small. Packaging shows toddlers playing with the set - item description did not specify this! Not a good item for a 10 year old. Poor description. I'd say pass...."
3,"For the price, you can't beat it","I was a little disappointed when my 3yr old daughter opened this (present) one stick is a lefty and one is a righty. I did not see that anywhere in the descriptions (read descriptions from several stores). The handles on the sticks are flat, like a ruler. The other thing is, the box calls this a ""knee hockey set"", didn't see that in the desc either. It is a good size for a 3-4 year old. The ball supplied is light weight, virtually it can't harm anything, so you can rest assured no matter how shoots it, it won't break anything (or hurt anyone!) however the ball seems to stick to the stick blade, makes it a little difficult for the child to get used to moving the ball with their stick."
1,"Predictable, boring, typically formulaic Turtledove drivel.","If you like predictable psuedo-historical formulaic drivel you'll love the continuation of the Videssos Cycle. This book, like so many of the author's, uses repetitive and unimaginative language and themes. Turtledove uses the same phrasing, the same situations, even the same quotations from one book to another. The simple stories go nowhere and the characters are one dimensional and unbelievable. These type of alternative historical novels have been done so much better by almost any author that has laid pen to paper."
4,The Biography of a Unique 20th Century Mormon Leader,"Frederick M. Smith was the president of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints--now the Community of Christ--between 1915 and 1948. Paul M. Edwards' biography of him was the first of a projected series of administrative biographies of Reorganization presidents, and it analyzed its subject as ""a visionary for the RLDS people who otherwise might not have moved so quickly from their own provincialism to embrace the changes sweeping America.""Edwards concluded in this book that ""Under Fred M. the RLDS church became a modern church."" Edwards was meticulous with his research and writing and created a rounded and useful portrait of a man of striking paradoxes. While not a definitive study, the book went far toward interpreting a major figure for the Reorganization and placing the movement more in the context of larger religious trends."
1,Be very careful my friend,I bought this product and I wanted to install it. I tried to install in on an older win98 secomputer and a XP computer. No luck. The big pronblem is that my email requests for support have gone unanswered.These guys are very unprofessional sorry to say that but you've got to test your software and you've got to offer support especially if you're selling aniche market product.
4,Another Fun-filled Ride on the Schoolbus!,"Ms. Frizzle takes the class on yet another extraordinary field trip! A photographer is coming to take a picture of the class and their garden for the cover of a magazine! However, Phoebe needs a plant for the class garden. Ms. Frizzle takes the class to her old school on a ladybug schoolbus ride! There they tour every major part of her flower and watch a seed being made. But will the class make it on time? Will Ms. Frizzle find love? This video was enjoyed by my students as a suplement to our plant and seed unit! This is one that kids will enjoy watching several times."
3,Great . . . at first,"This chopper was wonderful at first. Easy to chop things, easy to clean. But the flimsy plastic cracked within 3 months. I have had it now 10 months and it is falling apart. I do use it alot, but I would expect it to last longer - especially coming from Tupperware. My mother and sister have another brand (from another company that mainly sells at home parties) and theirs have lasted much longer."
2,"Great Coffee, Great Explosion!","Well, we purchased this item on Saturday and for four days we had great coffee! I like my coffee hot and this product brewed it quite hot and the carafe maintained the temperature very well. The best home brewed coffee I've ever had - no kidding! Then on the fourth day, after the coffee had been brewed and had been sitting for about an hour and a half - kablooey! The thermal line exploded and coffee drained out the bottom all over the counter top.Fortunately I didn't have to deal with Cuisinart, I just returned to the store where I had purchased it and I got a refund. Now I'm cogitating over what brew system to try next. As good as the coffee was, I don't think I'll buy another time bomb. Now looking for a system with a stainless thermos."
2,very disappointed,"We purchased this coffee maker (black) a year ago. We have already returned it once to Cuisinart and it just broke again. The first machine made coffee that had a very strange ""plastic"" after taste. We sent it back after attempting to clean it various ways. They sent us another one that had the same after taste but to a much lesser degree--it also didn't happen with every pot. Anyway, we kept it and used it daily. It has quit working now and we are looking for another brand--don't want to go through the hassle of sending it back to Cuisinart. We were very disappointed with this maker--had very high expectations because of the brand name.On the other hand, we did like the idea of the carafe. It kept the coffee hot for 2-3 hours. Wish it had been 10 cups though."
2,Very disappointed,"The coffee only stays hot in the carafe for approximately 1 1/2 hours. My previous thermal coffee maker (Black & Decker) was much better. That coffee would remain hot for at least 4 hours! Also, not happy with the ""Auto"" timer remaining on. There should be an indicator light letting you know that the Auto timer is active; otherwise, it's too easy to forget to turn it off. A few times the coffee maker brewed in the morning and there was nothing in it -- just because I forgot to turn the timer off! On a positive note, it definitely looks great on my kitchen counter."
1,Worst Investment I Ever Made,"This is the worst...coffee maker I have ever had. I bought this for my office 4 months ago, and it has already stopped working-for no reason at all. It also has many design flaws. The carafe itself is extremely hard to clean, and coffee tends to collect in it. It also has a hole in the back where you pour water in so that you don't overpour. If you happen to not be paying attention, water spills out everywhere. Also, the buttons are very flimsy, and the machine itself is made of...plastic, giving it a general [bad] look..."
3,No Cigar,Loved the machine at first. Looks great! Fast brew cycle. Easy to set timer. But...never could get really fine tasting coffee and had to use less water (or more beans) than usual. Finally sent it back.
2,disappointed by this machine,"While the machine makes a decent cup of java (or maybe that's just the operator), the timer and clock have never worked, and now after a couple of months of use the ""stop and pour"" drips. I would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone."
3,Makes great coffee - but watch out for overflow,"Overall, our experience with this coffee maker has been good, with a few very notable exceptions. On at least three occasions, if the carafe was not set exactly under the spring attached to the filter, major disaster has occurred. The water keeps pouring in to the filter, and eventually it runs over the top, since it is not flowing through the filter. This makes for a messy brown disaster that no one wants to deal with at 6:00 am. Makes great coffee when you're paying close attention, though."
1,One of the worst gifts I've ever purchased...,"I bought this as a gift for my mother, who needed a new coffee machine. It seemed like a great deal, and I trusted the Cuisinart brand. My mother was happy to receive the gift but a week or two later hesitantly told me that it was a terrible coffee maker - coffee was lukewarm the moment it was made, splattered out the top, and the whole thing, being white, was stained after just a few uses. She put it away and took out her old machine."
2,It broke again!,"I originally purchased this product in December 2000. After 3 months it stopped working - no idea why. Customer service was accomodating and we got it fixed. However, after 18 more months of use it stopped working again. We also had problems with overflow a couple times. I'm buying something different this time."
2,loved it - until it stopped working,"I bought this in late Dec. and it stopped working after 3 months. Customer service has been accomodating so far, but it will be several weeks before we get a replacement (and a coffee msker is an appliance you MISS - mornings are tough!).My experience could be a fluke, but I've never had a coffee maker just stop working before. I've only replaced them because I've found a better model, or the warming plate has worn out after years of use."
1,Don't Buy It!,"I am an avid coffee-drinker and have purchased many coffee makers. This is the worst coffee maker that I have ever owned! The reason why I bought this product was because the advertisers stated that each cup of coffee would be steaming hot. They claimed that this was possible due to the thermal carafe. This is a blatant lie! Maybe the first cup is hot, but the rest are luke warm at best. I followed the directions to a tee, but its claim of continuous hot coffee never materialized..."
3,Better this than buying 'em separate...,"Overall, not bad. Superman consists of the first three episodes of the Superman animated series, retelling the origin of Superman. Other than the introduction to that series, it's nothing new to Superman fans, who are better off buying the first season if they are into it. However, it'll definitely work for kids at an hour long. Batwoman is a brand new movie from the Batman animated series team, although the animation is different from the original series. Story wasn't bad, although not the best from this team. However, it was original enough to be enjoyable, and was definitely worth the watch. Extras are nice too, especially the highlight on the voice talent, which is a great extra for any cartoon on DVD. Overall, while I would suggest not buying either separately, I felt this combination was worth it. Keep rockin' in the free world..."
3,Fun,"Some of these episodes have better transfers, others worse. And some of them have a decidedly more ""Christmasy"" feel to them. The Annie Oakley episode in particular wasn't one that you'd really sit down on Christmas Eve to watch, and the Robin Hood one had little if anything to do with the holiday at all. But the ""Date With an Angels"" episode--starring a youthful Betty White--might make the purchase worthwhile by itself (though it does appear on a better DVD collection offered by Amazon,Christmas TV Classics, Vol. 2). Despite the poor transfer, the Burns and Allen ep also is a solid offering.I've been buying up old TV episodes on DVD for several years ago, and if you enjoy that sort of thing as I do, go ahead and buy this. You won't be sorry because it's inexpensive, and the included CD actually isn't that bad."
5,my son loves this book.,"My son loves history and he has really enjoyed reading and studying this book. He specializes in the hundred years war, and has found it most helpful. It came in good condition and he really likes it alot. thankyou."
2,kindle version only,way overpriced considering eversion lacks photos and type in sample jagged. might be pretty in print but translates poorly to kindle. book sounds like winner but i will wait for price to come down to earth or find used hardcover in local bookshop
1,Broke Quickly,"Previously owned [money] Osterizer blender for 10 years which worked just as well as this Cuisinart blender. Shortly after the warranty expired but only after 15 uses, the clutch -- which is plastic -- broke. Without the clutch, the machine is inoperable. When I called Cuisinart to inquire into repairing this product, they told me I would have to mail the blender base (motor is heavy!) and then, only after receipt they would estimate the cost of fixing the machine. When I asked for the average cost of repair, the answer was at least [money]. In other words, for the cost of buying a new Osterizer, I could pay for another plastic clutch to be installed. No thank you. A friend of mine who owned a Cuisinart blender had the same thing happen. She now owns a KitchenAid blender and is very happy with it."
2,Difficult to mount on base,"I have Cuisinart products I like, but this was a disappointment. The plastic bottom of the container holds the blade in place, and sits on the rubber rotor on the top of the chrome base. However, both the bottom of the blade and the top of the base (where the motor is) have teeth which must mesh when you insert the top on the baase of the machine. It takes a few tries to make this work every time you replace the top on the base. What a pain.I make banana shakes, and this machine leaves chunks of banana! It takes several tries, and even then does not always complete the job.When I try to chop things llike nuts or bread crumbs, they tend to collect in the narrow bottom around the blade and get gummy instead of chopping. I never had this problem with my old Waring.Plastic parts have a cheap feel. Next time - and I'm sure there will have to a next time with this machine - I'll get a good American made Waring. I don't find a use for the multiple speeds. at all."
1,Blender leaks...,"I have only used this blender a few times and it now leaks out of the bottom and is no longer usable. I would not buy this blender again. It looks nice, but did not last long."
3,Not one of her best.,"A lot of the songs are embarrassing (like ""Leviathan,"" which is mostly fun to listen to and laugh at) and/or crappy pop, but there are a couple of good ones--""Like an Island Rising"" is certainly worth an iTunes download."
2,Hell of a plan,"I don't understand how the author suggest that a war with Islam is not inevitable using his only proof that he was helped by a person who left islam for a life in Christ. Is he suggesting that we set up a system for hostages to be taken in the hope they convert one at a time ,one out a few dozen every few weeks for a billion people .That would take weeks*Flat out the Quran calls for my death the subjugation and eventual eradication of all non muslims I would like to avoid that but I cant change that I wont over look it either."
1,POS fell apart in just 2 months,I don't understand the positive reviews on this pack because it fell apart under light use in just 2 months.I'd give this zero stars if possible.[...]. Stay away from this POS! I'll never buy an OGIO product again because I've never owned a backpack that has fallen apart this quickly or extensively - especially under such light use.Advice for OGIO:Product test the pack and maybe you'll realize you've chosen the wrong material and stitching. FAIL!!!! and worst part is there's no way to return it even though they say it's under warranty.Thanks for stealing my money.Stay away from OGIO crap.
5,Perfect for traveling,"I had been looking for a day pack for a long time for traveling, but couldn't find one with side zip pockets. Most have mesh pockets for water bottles which wasn't what I wanted. I like compartments when I take month-long trips for different types of items. This pack was designed for a laptop, but the largest compartment is large enough to pack other items when traveling such as a camera and different lens. It's a perfect addition to my luggage."
2,Not for teaching adults,This book deals with teaching children English as a second language in public schools from age 5 up to adolescents. I teach primarily adults which this book does not tough upon. For that reason I would only recommend someone buying this book if you only want to teach large classes of children or young adolescents. Not appropriate for adults.
5,A must have,"I having been teach ESL students for four years. I found this book to be extremely handy. It is an easy, interesting read and very informative. Any teacher could benefit from the use of most of these strategies. The book offered creative ways to differ your instruction. I love it!"
3,Not bad,I needed this for my TESOL 2 class. It was well written and easy to read because the chapters were short and to the point. It also had alot of useful stuff (50 strategies :-D) that would be easy to write a lesson around so I hope I can put it to use when I have a class of my own.
2,Very disappointed... Only lasted a couple of months.,"Got these based on other decent reviews, and I was semi-happy with them in the beginning. Sound was decent. Microphone worked fine. I bought to use with Skype and had few complaints.The headband adjustments were a bit tight. The cushions are a bit firm and I didn't like they plastic that they are made of. Would prefer foam ones, as don't allow enough breathing and they become little moisture chambers. Be prepared for sweaty ears.But what ultimately left me unhappy was that the sound started cutting out on me and it turned out to be the cord where it enters the headphone. If I fiddled with it, the sound would come in and out. After only about 4-5 months of light use.Using a decent wire and construction shouldn't be difficult or expensive."
2,Very uncomfortable,I can't wear these for longer than 30 minutes without eperiencing extreme discomfort on my ears. So I use another pair of headphones to hear and just put these around my neck for the mic.Do not buy.
2,"Works great, but lacks mids and highs!","PROS:- Immediately recognized by Mac OS X.- Great for Skype- Comfortable and light- Mic sounds good on SkypeCONS:- AWFUL performance for music: too much bass, no mids and highs are rolled off. EQ'ing Itunes helped, but it's still far from perfect. This set doesn't reproduce high frequencies very well.If you just want to use it for Skype, it's great. If you also want to listen to music, I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,"Voice is clear, but for some reason the earpiece broke","It ran pretty well until the earpiece broke. The customer service said that warranty does not cover it, blah..blah..The bad thing about it is that it's too bulky, and if anyone is looking for something portable, stay away. But for desktop use, I think the audio quality is pretty good."
4,good value,Skype was our first venture into on-line fone service and this headset fits the bill perfectly! Fits comfortably and is easy to use--great valueBuzz
2,OK headset but has hidden problems,I have grown to really dislike this headset. This is about my fourth and I find it a real problem to use.First there is not volume control or mute button so you can only control it by opening a device manager.Second if you want to listen to music on your PC you have to switch the driver to your sound card. If you want to listen to music on your headset you have switch your driver to the USB device. It is a total hassle. You cannot just switch your speakers on and off. If you use skype and voip you have to constantly fiddle with the drivers to configure you sound how you want. No other headset has done this to me. You just plug them in and everything works as you want it.
2,You can get it cheaper,"You can get the same or better quality on other headsets cheaper than this one. Just for having the convenience of USB I paid twice the price compared to the previous that I had from CompUSA brand, which maybe it had better sound."
4,Best USB headset,"Of all the USB headsets I've tried, these are the best, and one of the cheaper ones too. The sound is great and I've even recorded music with these. I've used it on both PCs and Macs. The reason why I only give it 4 stars is because the plastic foam around the headset is quite painful after wearing the headphones for about an hour. It also makes it hard for your ears to breathe. Otherwise, a great pair of headsets. Better than a SONY USB headset that I recently bought for twice the price. Would reccommend this highly. (Also very durable - I carry it in my laptop bag everyday, to and from work)."
1,"shoddy, shoddy quality","After less than four months of occasional use at my desk, no particularly wear or tear, the headset has a faulty contact and the microphone is dead. While it's under warranty, shipping it to Logitech is almost as much as a new headset."
4,4 starts,Bought For online gaming over Vent. Plugged it in and it works! No complaints so far though it hasn't seen much use to be honest.
1,didn't last long,"this headset worked fine on PC and PS3 until the microphone stopped working one day (only ~3 months since i purchased it), never to work again. looking at the other reviews this does not seem uncommon."
1,"Poor reliability and build, lasted three days","The headset was easy to setup on my mac. I was able to plug it in and it started working. Everything went fine until day 3 when it just stopped working all together. I thought it might have been a driver problem and tried another computer. It was the headset which had less than 8 hours on it.I opened up the headset and could not believe the poor build quality. The wires are barely soldered on the board. The wire were very poor quality and very thin, which is likely leading to some of the problems with the headset. The factory had smeared some gunk all over the circuit board. It should have never left the factory in this condition.I will not buy this headset again, especially seeing as it only worked 3 days. I have noticed other reviews stating the same problems with this headset.It is not worth sending back because of the poor build quality and reliability.Do yourself a favor and read some of the one star reviews. I could have saved myself some trouble."
3,"sound is good, but right earphone broke after only 3months","The sound quality is very good, and everyone says I sound good to them through the microphone. The main problem I have is that the right earphone broke off and is just dangling by the wires. I put it in my laptop bag, but there wasn't much pressure on it, it just isn't very durable.A volume or mute button would be nice"
2,Logitech 980356-0403 Stereo USB Headset 250,"I think basically I got what I paid for - a cheap quality usb headset with fairly lousy sound quality. There is no volumn control which might make it better, but for the most part I'm sure if I end up using a headset a lot for calls on Skype, I'll end up buying another headset. If you use a headset often, buy a better one."
2,Lovely but won't last,"I keep buying these and they keep breaking. They're lovely and comfortable but they keep failing and I'm not ""abusing"" them."
2,Breaks Easily,"This headset was great for about 3 months, then just stopped working. The pc still recognized the headset, but no sound.Meh, should have known better than to buy something other than a mouse from logitech."
4,Cheaper at Walmart,The sound quality is great even at the highest volume. But I found the same peice cheaper in Walmart - much cheaper
2,I liked them while they lasted,"At first, I liked them. They were reasonably comfortable for the price; and they had good sound (both sending and receiving). But, after a couple months, they started dropping out in the left ear. Then, a few months later, they stopped working altogether."
5,Excellent USB Headset,"For skype users like me, it really works. I can talk on the computer and have some privacy."
2,great until...,"I bought this for use for VOIP and it worked great until one day, one side of the speaker stopped working.. then later that day, the microphone and the right side stopped workin too!! All this happened less than 3 months after I bought it & now I have to buy another one."
2,Don't be really fooled by this rating...I mostly blame oil for the bad rating,I bought this so that I could have more fun playing CounterStrikePROS:I'm a power user so once I got the headset (from newegg) I disabled my onboard sound....Headset worked great...nice alternative to weak output of onboard sound chipsPlug and Play Had no problem except for that one time where it kept not detecting it correctly....(should've deleted that driver from system32)VERY STRONG QUALITY when I'm either listening to Youtube etc.CONS:Doesn't really have a one size fits all setting..:/It loves oil. Whenever I eat chips/oily food...the oil from ears would seep to the muffs. Had to wipe it with alcohol cleaner every couple of days...and then the left muff broke even when I didn't use excessive force..It just fell off.Get a more expensive headset with bigger muffs.
2,not upto the mark,"I bought it one month back in $27. I did not like this product. This is an USB headphone. Most of the laptop has two USB ports and if you are using one mouse and one webcam then there is not place to put this USB headphone. Now whenever I want to chat then I have to take out my mouse. Second, even the voice quality is not worth $27. Third, if some application is running and you want to start listening through this headphone, you have to restart the application. So I say that I do have a very good satisfaction with this headphone."
5,Great Product,"Plugged them in and they worked beautifully, no drivers, no fuss, no hassle. Sound quality and microphone are outstanding for telephone conversations."
4,Great headset! Comfortable & Easy to use!,"I received one of these headsets for work (Stockholm, Sweden) and liked it so much I purchased another and had it shipped from Amazon directly to my mother in San Francisco. It was extremely easy for her to set up and use with Skype. I would recommend it to others contemplating headsets within this price range."
3,Great Headset...Until,"I got this primarily due to the level of rating it received. Well I was very happy initially with the headset in receive and sound quality, though as I used it the boom mike became worse and worse until I had literally angle the mic around my face and off my right ear in order to have someone hear me on the VOIP system.Good headset but I expect MUCH better in microphone quality."
3,I'd look for something cheaper.,"Its a good product overall, easy plugnplay, a very clear mic and long cord (around 7.5 ft)Problems: The design tends to pinch the ears, especially if you wear glasses like me. Moving the glasses ups helps slightly, but using these things for long periods of times caused me discomfort, as the leather that surrounds the speakers are fairly hard. I'd avoid this altogether if you have ears that stick out.I've noticed also that there are some problems with audio. My right speaker started experiencing problems about 2 months after I purchased them. Worked only when I jiggled the cord, so I popped it open and noticed the casing pinches the wires and is frail when the cord is twisted."
5,A great buy,"This a great buy. I bought mine at Radioshack for $40 and a couple years later it will works beautifully. Very easy to use (just plug it into a USB port)and very reliable. My friends have never complained about the sound quality. Would recommend buying new as to make sure it works, but I wouldn't be surprised if you bought used and it still worked great. An awesome deal."
4,OK as headphones...not OK as headset for voice chatting,"Update - I played with some settings on my computer and it works fine. It is just a little bit uncomfortable on the ears.------Original Review:I got this headset from my company. They were pushing it out as a communication device for the soft phone on our computers.It works decently as headphones. But, when it come sto talking the microphone is horrible.The mic does not pickup your voice....to the other person it sounds as if you're talking to them from 60 feet away.To add to this the boom of the microphone is too short.Now if you speak directly to the mic you hear a lot of disturbance because of the air from your mouth.Bottom line...if you need headphones, buy something like Philips or Sony, if you need a headset don't buy this one..buy something else."
4,Great price/quality,"I've had the item for quite a while, always in my bag, so far it's not broken (I expected it to break much sooner!). I used to skype my friends with it before Skype came up with the pro number. I have no longer a use for it, except when I'm abroad. But it's a great item, good sound quality... and not fragile!"
2,Not too Good!,"The first few times it worked great, after that i haven't been able to use it, for some reason incoming audio is good but the mic does not work, i have to use my computer's which is anoying so i stopped using altogether. Waste of money."
4,Meet the Barkers,"Tomie Depoalo wrote the book Meet the Bakers. Some of the main characters are Moffat, Mogan, Mom and Ms. Shepard.First, there were two twins, a brother and sister named Moffat and Morgan. They were getting ready to start kindergarten. Moffat was born first so she was the boss. Then, the kids had to go shopping for school stuff. Next, they go to school. On their first day moffat got a gold star and morgan met a friend Billy. Fourth, they go home and tell their mom how it was. Finally, Moffat meets a friend and morgan got a gold star.Then they went home and told their mom that they loved school.I liked this book because it reminds me of when I was in kindergarten. I think my brothers would like it because they are in kindergarten."
4,Tomie's Barker Books,"I like this series of Tomie dePaola books and this is a cute story. I would recommend this for younger students and I would recommend the sequel ""A New Barker in the House."" Both are very cute and my students loved the the comparison of the twins and how they coped with school."
4,"Mmm, mmm, good","Reminiscent of the great sandwiches and drinks that Edward X. Delaney shared with us in the Deadly Sin novels, Arch McNally continues the tradition. I would love to visit the Pelican Club for a month, trying each of Mr. Pettibone's drinks and Priscilla's sandwiches, then go for a long swim in the ocean."
5,A most authoritative book,"As a practicing clinician and a researcher, I had frequently consulted the first edition of Experimental and Clinical Neurotoxicology since its publication in 1980, and I am glad that a new edition has now become available because considerable advances have been made in this field over the past 20 years. Glancing through the pages of the new edition, I note that the editors have kept up the high standard of the earlier work. The text has been thoroughly revised and updated, and new subjects added. I have no doubt that it will continue to be a most authoritative book in neurotoxicology."
1,not worth the money,"I typically think of Tupperware as having a good, long lasting product because of the quality with which its made. This carrier, however, is cheap & the way it holds together is flimsy. On more than one occasion the clips on the side have come undone & have caused me to drop a perfectly good cake on the floor & lose it. I'm in the market for a new one (different company) because this one does not hold together & I'm sick of losing my creations as I walk out the door with them!"
1,Don't buy it,"I hate this cake carrier. The locks that hold it together come undone easily, allowing your cake to drop to the ground. Mine broke, and Tupperware did not replace it. Don't buy this."
3,Cute Little Book,"This is a cute little book that is definately geared to those who practice ""Compass"" forms of Feng Shui. Some of the tips made me chuckle and some I marked for reference and possible usage. For what ever form of Feng Shui you practice, I'd say some, or a good many of Ms. Wong's do's and don't's are adaptable to your form, but the book does require some knowledge and back ground in Feng Shui, or you might be instituting the wrong cure. This little book has a somewhat more light-hearted approach then I expected, but it is a good antidote to those ponderous and deadly dull Feng Shui authors/practitioners who think they know it all and spend their time intolerantly bashing anyone who does not practice their exact form of Feng Shui. I would still highly recommend Karen Rauch Carter and Stephen Skinner for your first forays into Feng Shui, and after you become more proficient Ms. Wong's book will have it's place."
2,"Buy ""Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life"" Instead","Few suggestions in this book come with any reasoning behind them. If you are the type of person who likes to understand the reasoning behind given suggestions - don't bother with this one. If you can blindly follow directions, without knowing why - go for it. In summary, it's a quick read and may serve to spark someones interest in the subject but that's all folks."
3,Mini Glossary,"Feng Shui Dos & Taboos is like the glossary that you wish the big Feng Shui books had in the back pages. Though a little pricey for the amount of content, it's ok as a quick answer guide."
4,Fun with Feng Shui,This is a tremendously easy book to read. It is enormously informative and well written. It guides you along so that you can use Feng shui to your advantage to achieve peace and harmony and enhance the good things in life such as romance and prosperity. It is a darling book and well worth the money.
4,Good suit for amateur lap swimming,"Good basic practice suit, but the straps become uncomfortable after long wear. Seems durable though!"
4,This is a great prep for the MOUS Excel 97 exams,"I found this to be an indispensable assistant in passing the basic and advanced MOUS Excel 97 exams. The book shows you step-by-step all the skills you need to pass either of the tests. On the MCSE tests, you just need to know the answers to multiple choice questions, and that's what the Transcender material is designed to do. The MOUS tests don't work that way. You need to know how to complete each project. While the MCSE tests are basically multiple choice, the MOUS tests are project based. True, you don't get the exact questions you might see on the test, but anyone who passes the exams in the book shouldn't have any problems with the tests. It would be nice to have the exact projects that would show up on the test, but that would defeat the purpose of the test and make it worthless. For my money, this is a great book, and I would encourage users preparing for the MOUS Excel 97 exams to buy the book!"
4,Microsoft Excel 97 Exam Cram,"Trudi Reisner does a great job covering just what you need to know for the Excel Expert or Specialist Exam--nothing more, nothing less. Quick tasks reinforce the lesson, and practice exercises and tests have detailed answers. Another 3-book set I used belabored unimportant and confusing extra details and failed to cover crucial topics.I had a couple of questions on the material, so I e-mailed Trudi (e-mail address included with book). She was great about getting back to me and answering my questions. This book gives good test-taking hints, a last-minute cram sheet, and a personal touch!"
2,Did not pass expert level using this book.,"I practically memorized this book from cover to cover and had all the excercises down pat before going into the expert level test. I quickly became discouraged as I moved from task to task and began to realize that this particular Exam Cram book was not ""The first and last book I needed to read before taking my certification exam""."
2,Good for beginning furniture painters,"I would NOT recommend this book if you are an advanced artist looking for new and fabulous furniture ideas. I was disappointed after receiving this book. This book does not contain anything that is ""to die for"", just the plain ole basics. However, if you are a beginner, this book will give you the basics for step by step furniture preparation and materials. It has good information on tools and lots of materials that are important to the beginner.If you are looking for beautiful old world style, modern or contemorary painted furniture, this book is NOT for you.!!I recommend: ""Sophisticated Surfaces"" by Karen Aude. It has beautiful professional ideas for walls, floors and furniture. It features professional artists and sample pictures of their painted furniture, walls and floors."
3,A decent piece of fiction,"As sci-fi action/thrillers go, this book is quite well written. As Nazi Propaganda, it is actually very poorly written. The majority of people that will read this book will already agree with the author's Nazi philosophies. But the arguments for believing in Nazi propaganda are quite weak.The main character is hired by the SS as a mercenary, and without revealing any plotlines, he is completely a-political, and in fact has an Indian girlfriend. Despite his stronger arguments AGAINST Nazism and racism, he is eventually converted to the Nazi party line with arguments as weak as ""The Holocaust was a hoax because we say so.""While this was an entertaining read, it will not convert anyone to the Nazi Party who isn't already 3/4 of the way there."
4,A must for any W.N. library,"A great story and piece of W.N. fiction on the lines of ""Hear the Cradles Song"" genre. A short read and a small volume so not hard to simply carry with you anywhere and read. Worth every cent and something to share or pass on to others within the ranks of the cause."
3,Enjoyable ... But Consider The Source,"This is another piece of fictional propaganda put out by those ""hip"" neo-nazis, the National Alliance.The book is a page turner, it engages the reader and brings him/her into the mind of a people who feel that their Social Darwinist Imperative is essential for the survival of Western Civiliztion.This is why books such as this and ""The Turner Diaries"" were produced. They are out there to reach deep inside every white man and woman and manipulate our fears as a people.(...)If you are one of their target audience and read these things for any reason other than a morbid curiousity for the mentally twisted, I feel sorry for you as a human being."
1,Well written Nazi propaganda,"This book is essentially an exposition of Nazi philosophy written in the style of a novel. While the action sequences are quite good there's too much preachy political nonsense. The book maintains that races should be separated and that the Holocaust never took place. There may be something to be said for cultural homogeneity but it would be an awfully boring world if the only people you ever saw were whites or blacks or asians, etc... Nonetheless, I can see how this book would appeal to people who are frightened and bewildered by the globalization of the economy and the world."
1,Seller had the insight to watch where this book was to be delivered,"This book would have fallen into the hands of my son a prison inmate, the people selling the book gave me a full refund explaining why this book should not be in the hands of prisoners unless they have a good reason. This is a portion of the e-mail I sent to the seller, ""Thank you for stopping this book from falling in my sons hands, after I read the other comments I realized my son is playing a dangerous balancing act with faith.""People that put morals and thought in front of a sale are awesome people. I thank them for caring about my son. A parent that is thanking God for people that care about others.A return buyer that will be back to buy books,Sandy"
5,Quality DIY,"I loved this book. Ledoux's clever writing and descriptions, coupled with great photos, truly turned me on to the DIY world. I created cool re-upholstered chairs by following her office chair transformation guide. Other favorite ""a la Mode"" projects on my list: two-tiered coffee table on wheels, applique window panels and art paper tube shade.I also enjoyed Ledoux's suggestions on using funky 50's fabrics, and how to harmonize colors and designs. Everything in this book seems relatively cheap, easy and fun to make! Again, I loved it!"
5,Awesome craft book!,"Recently I've been purchasing craft books so that I can jazz up my new apartment. This is easily the best one yet. The projects are practical, clever, and easy to make. I can't wait to start making them!Definitely recommend this one over most of the other craft books."
2,Such a let down,"If you are looking for a book to give you the absolute basics, you've found your book. The projects are simplistic and unimaginitive. The ideas uninspired. Most seem to be something you could find in any craft or do-it-yourself magazine.I had high hopes, but this is really a book for someone that has no imagination what-so-ever."
3,of the book,"The illustrations in this book were nice full page drawings. The book is thin, has maybe 20 pages. The story does include some history leading to the event which is nice. But the conclusion seemed a bit short. I was looking for more details about the night that the fort was bombed, an explanation of the lines Key wrote, how many soldiers died, etc. This has no details like that, just kind of a general overview. So maybe this book was written for kids."
5,Love these glasses,"I have used these glasses for the past 16 years. I had to order more. Wash them by hand so the gold trim lasts longer and the glass doesn't scratch in the dishwasher. The label comes off easily in dish water. If you have china with a gold trim, these glasses are a must."
4,Bode actually seems human,"Excellent video, a bit disjointed but really does nail down some serious beginner and intermediate tips in many parts, he actually skis like an intermediate to show what can happen and what should happen. Money well spent"
5,Hall & Oates Greatest Hits..,"Being a big fan of Hall & Oates since I heard their music--I fell in love with them and all their music. I just purchased their Greatest Hits CD & it is awesome. For those Hall & Oates fans..I suggest you purchase it. Their music just makes you come alive. It's romantic & has the best of the best songs they made & more. Their are 2 cd's & there are songs I've never heard..& I thought I heard everyone of them. Again, this cd is awesome."
3,"SO, SO","I like this Item at first it worked well, but I'm on my third one because to crome finish keeps pitting in my dishwasher."
1,sheer stupidity,"Why would anybody in their right mind make an ice cream scoop that you can't throw in the dishwasher and have to wipe off right away due to the product it was intended to be used for will cause it to pit?What are they thinking? That is like making a gas can that will melt after you put gas in it! How many thousands and thousands of these have they had to warranty? If they would have made it right the first time, they probably would have saved a lot of money.Don't waste yours! Buy some other brand!"
2,Not the best out there....,"Yes, the Tupperware scoop lives up to most of it's claims. But I want to share with you that there is a better scoop out there. The Tupperware scoop is very heavy and requires you to run it under hot water first. The Pampered Chef has a scoop very similar to this that uses the heat from your hand and is immediately ready to slice right through even the most frozen of icecreams. No, I'm not a consultant, just a happy customer. One word of warning for both of these products: don't leave the scoop in the box, even for a minute, it will melt all the way to the bottom. (I say this from experience)"
3,tupperware ice cream scoop,"Sturdy enough to be a good scooper however after 8 years of use the chrome is flaking off the metal. (Nothing like metal flakes in your ice cream, it's a real hit with the kids...!?!) We do put it in the dishwasher and in this day and age shouldn't they find a way to make everything dishwasher safe? Even though we don't use the heat dry option and let the dishes air dry it just didn't hold up. We bought a Faberware scooper at Walmart for around $6 or $7. At half the price it works well and should be dishwasher safe and last a long time."
4,Great for lecture,"This recorder comes with a very sensitive mic. On the upside this makes it great for recording lectures. On the downside you pick up a lot of ambient when doing so.The built in voice filter is shockingly effective for lecture play back and really addresses many of the problems with background noise.The user interface is a bit clunky. Downloading to computer fixes that problem; however, when doing so you give up the background filter!I appreciate that the files are captured raw and filtered later but it would be great if they could be applied on export as well.The other problem of note is not being able to resume a stopped recording. You can of course pause a recording, but when one is stopped that's it."
3,gift,this was an amazon gift list item so I do not know anything about it...the person that received me thanked me
1,Not What I expected,"I purchased an Olympus DS-40 from Fry's Electronics for $160.00. I got a box that contained the digital voice recorder, the software, a usb port cable, headphones, and an AC Adapter. I returned it thinking that I was going to get a better deal on Amazon.com. What I got was a digital recorder, the software, and two AAA batteries for $114.00. As far as I'm concerned I did NOT get a better deal. In thought I was going to get the same thing that I returned, but I learned that you get what you pay for. I DON'T EVEN HAVE A PHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO TALK TO SOMEONE. I look on Amazon.com to contact them by phone and all I get is a list of items that I can buy for customer service training. I will be returning this product to the fact it is not the complete product that I was paying for."
4,Good value for price,"I am a physician and use this for dictation of patient visits. This is a great unit except for one small issue. There is no way to review your dictation in any particular file while you are dictating, and then resume dictating. Once you either push the stop button, or the play button, the file is ended and the next time you push the REC button, it starts a new file. You have to buy the more expensive models (~ $100 more) for this option. Otherwise the voice activation control works great and the sound quality is good. Great price at Amazon, $103. $159 at Best Buy."
4,If it only had removeable memory...,This is a nice stereo recorder. It picks up a lot of background noise with the stereo and built-in mics. I added an extension cord to the stereo mic and got better results. I wish that this recorder had removeable/replaceable memory. Compact flash memory is inexpensive and it would be nice to simply pop in another chip when the memory is full.
3,Olympus DS-40 is not Mac Compatable,"Once you wade through to extreem complexity of managing all this recorders features, it does a fine job of recording. The include software is for PC Windoz only, so Mac users might want to forget using this product.Keep the extensive manual handy because you'll be referencing it frequently."
4,A Powerful Professional Tool,"The Olympus DS-40 delivers on its promise as a professional recording device. Its combination of small size, bright and informative display and ease of use, along with long battery life and excellent audio fidelity, makes it a must-buy for many users. The issues that hold it back from a five-star rating are rather loud handling noise--it picks up a great deal of noise from your hand while the holding it, rendering it virtually unusable for newsgathering or ""found audio"" music recording--and its WMA-only recording format. Professional audio users will easily convert Windows Media Audio files to other formats, but the handling noise and lack of a high-bitrate .WAV recording option keeps this otherwise excellent and affordable device primarily in the on-the-desk dictation category."
4,Olympus ds-40,"This is an excellent voice recorder, but don't get it if you wish to record live music or your practice sessions with a guitar or piano. I tried it and the resulting sound was just plain awful--just one mushy sound. I returned it to Amazon and bought the LS-10 which just arrived today. I've already tried it out and it's a hundred times better than the DS-40 for the purpose of recording live music."
4,Easy to use and good sound quality,"If you want an easy-to-use and reliable digital recorder, this one's for you. It took me 5 minutes to learn how to use it. The sound quality is excellent when recording multiple voices in a room. Over the phone, the sound was not as clear but perhaps I could have used a different setting. The disk space is generous, and you can organize recordings into separate file folders."
1,Go for Sony ICD-PX820 at 1/4 of the price,"I was in a conference room in LA for 6 days for 8 hrs a day and a friend was recording with the Olympus DS-40 with the special Mic that comes with the recorder and I was recording with the Sony ICD-PX820 and the Olympus sound was like with lots of eco and like inside of a can and my recording is clear and understandable like the guy was there. Very easy to use and you can edit on the go, the batteries long me almost the entire conference (I came with replacements that I just change the last day the final hours, just in case). I recomend go for the Sony ICD-PX820 instead of the Olympus and is 1/4 the price of the Olympus and best sound quality (you can also add a mic if you need it but I didnt need it in that conference)."
1,"Unfriendly, no features at all","Will not let you modify, cut any section of the recording. Unfriendly buttons are completely unintuitive. Clueless with Macs. The sound quality is good, but a lot of rubbing/handling noise. Are there alternatives? Always running out of storage."
1,Another useless product,"My cell phone can do it better. Don't buy it I give mine for free. Seriously, too many required words for a review."
3,"great information, bad sourceing","Pennypacker was a historian on Long Island in the first half of the 1900's. He did some groundbreaking research and came up with information about some spies during the american revolution. pennypacker is generally said to have discovered the identity of one of the most active spies of the revolution. however, in recent years, pennypacker, who wrote in the dry way that was typical of nonfiction in his day,has been frowned upon. one big and frustrating reason was he didn't document his sources. Still, this is one of the works from the man who lived a historian's dream and changed our knowledge of history."
4,Fairy Tale for all ages with young romantic hearts,"A Kiss to Remember, by Teresa Medeiros, is an interesting, dreamy story with many location changes with words so descriptive I could see it all in my mind. I loved all of the characters, except Carlotta (just too evil for a child). I laughed a lot through it, the H&H were perfect. I cried all through the last two chapters (and again as I went through all the first pages of the chapters reading his mother's notes). I was emotionally exhausted and happy when I closed the book at the end. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it wasn't really my style of story, it being a fairy story (even though the passion was good). (THIEF OF HEARTS BY Teresa Medeiros is my idea of 5 stars). I do highly recommend this as a good book, just a little young for me."
5,WonderfuL book,"This book was such a joy to read. I read this book non-stop. Loved the fairy tale theme. This was my first book that I have read by this author, and I must say I am definitely going to be a new fan of her books. I have just received a few other books from her today and will be reading tonight!!"
5,A kiss to remember by Teresa Medeiros,"When her benefactor dies, Laura learns that the woman's prodigal son, plans to return to Arden Manor. Laura is determined to keep him from casting her and her family into the streets. The only hope she has is a stipulation in the will that says if she weds by her twenty-first birthday --three weeks away -- the house will be hers. She prays for a miracle, which seems to be answered in the form of a fallen man who awakens with no memory. She does the unthinkable and claims him as her fiancé. The story takes off from there and brings the reader into their wonderful world. What will happen when Laura learns' who her fiancé? How will he react when he realizes he has been tricked? That is for the reader to find out. This is one book you won't forget or easily put down."
5,5 stars! Very highly recommended.,"Every book Ms. Medeiros has written goes right to my keeper shelf, and this one is no exception. The author always knows how to write scenes that are both poignant and laugh-out-loud funny. What I liked best about this story was the emotional depth and plot twists. Laura and Sterling are wonderful characters."
4,Really a 4 1/2,"I loved this book! It was a quick,light, interesting read. The character's are colorful and at times very amusing. I enjoyed the amnesia element to the story as well. The only real problem I had with the book was with a secondary character (the heroine's sister). It seemed as if they would allow her to behave in any way without even getting angry at her...I just found that aspect irritating, but otherwise the book was wonderful!"
2,Not one of her best...,"Okay. So I have to admit that I haven't been able to force myself to read this book all the way through, despite trying several times. I found the heroine very selfish and manipulative, rather than innocent and cute, as I'm sure she's meant to be. She takes advantage of an injured man, telling lie after lie, binding him to her and trying to shape his personality to her own desires, not once thinking of him as an individual with his own life or loved ones to return to. And then when things go awry and he demands that she become either his mistress or his wife, she has the gall to say that HE tricked HER and that he is not giving her a choice. Ironic, hmm? Definitely not a story line that sits well with me."
2,A Kiss to Remember,A rather boring book. Boy meets girl falls in love type. Not enough plot and what there is is not interesting. I have read a few other books by this author but will not purchase another. I like some sizzle in a romance and I found none in this one.
2,Come Clean Mrs. Meyer,Mrs. Meyer's Clean Dish Soap is a useful product but expensive. The box arrived with a spill from one 16 oz. bottle that made a big mess. It is not packed well for shipping. Now I have to clean up my front poarch and Mrs. Meyer is not here to help!
2,no lemon verbena fragrance,bought this cause I love lemon verbena fragrance- doesn't smell bad but way strong- makes me sneeze-but diluted twice amount of water gets dishes clean so ok
1,Scent of soap remains on dishes,"I wanted to like this soap. The fragrance was wonderful until it stayed on everything I washed with it. I rinsed and rinsed, and tried using less with no avail. I bought the Seventh Generation Free and Clear dish soap instead and didn't have the same peobelm."
3,Left scent on everything,"The soap worked well as far as cleaning the dishes. However, it left a lemon verbena scent on everything, especially plasticware, that we could taste! Yuck"
1,Toxic Product,"Mrs. Meyer's dish soap and many other products in this line are very toxic. I'm told they made it into the 'health section' of stores because they are biodegradeable. However, they contain toxic synthetic fragrances -- note they are simply listed as 'fragrance' on the label. Synthetic fragrances are known to disrupt hormones (promoting obesity, thyroid disorders, sperm damage, and birth defects), induce or worsen respiratory problems, cause immune system supression cancer and kidney disease, and damage the brain and nervous system.Many companies add a natural ingredient (in this case lemon verbena or lavender - if these are indeed the real thing - to pretend their product is natural. This is unethical.For general cleaning I recommend vinegar. For dish soap - I suggest you look at other brands.If you desire more information on fragrances and their toxic effects, Sandra Redemske of Redemske Design has put together some remarkable information."
2,I hate the smell,"Well, so it goes for ordering online. This smell just did not work for me. And it is so strong that I smell it after I am done with dishes. I usually like lemon verbena smell of other products or brands but this one is a killer."
3,"Smells great, cleans well, but is a little pricey!","I use A LOT of the Mrs. Meyers products. This dish soap is nice. It cleans well and the scent makes my kitchen smell nice. There are other mrs. meyers products that seem to have better bang for their buck (e.g., candle)."
3,3 stars for the great scent,"I LOVE how the lemon verbena scent smells, but this is the WORST performing dish soap I've ever used! I use a refillable foam pumper, and this is just awful in it. So I tried it full strength...not much better! While I do like the Dawn Foam, it's so expensive that I just use the original Dawn in my pump & it's the best dish soap I've ever used."
2,Not very good.,"I finally purchased the Mrs. Meyer's lavender dish soap after seeing on the store shelves. I find the scent to be very ""perfumey"" and it almost smells like artificial lavender. The soap cleans ok, but the smell seems to linger on glasses and cook-wear even after an extensive rinse. The lingering smell is enough for me not to recommend the product."
2,"""Soap"" from the Middle Ages","I've used this product for several years now, but it isn't working very well lately. The main problem is that there's very few bubbles and I found I was having to use more and more product to get my dishes and pans clean. The consistency appears to be the same, but it just doesn't clean. In fact, this is my main complaint with most all of the Mrs. Meyers products I've used. They smell nice but don't do much beyond that. I feel like I'm using a product that was devised for a reniassance home - lots of perfume to cover the bad smells, but no cleaning power. What a let down.Update: Thanks Christopher Davis for the confirmation that the formula was changed by the manufacturer. It was pretty good prior to the change. Not so much so now. I still stand by my review!"
2,If you like your food smelling like flowers,"This stuff smells so good, I love the packaging and the hand soap but I got the dish soap and now everything I cook in my frying pan smells like flowers. Smells great, tastes not so great. I cant get the freakin flowers out either. I hate taking stuff back to the STO but this is gross."
3,Does it's job but smells like artificial floral scent,"This dish soap is a disappointment. I love lemon-verbena scent. This does not smell anything like it. It smells like an overly perfumed fabric softener. I won't be buying this again. It does however do it's job, that's why I gave it 3 stars."
2,Perfumey greenwashing,"It suds pretty well - I'll give it that. But the nonsense about being scented with ""essential oils"" is greenwashed bullhockey. The scent of this product comes from artificial fragrance, with a smattering of real essence thrown in so they can charge you double. Every time I wash dishes I choke on perfume, and the smell of fake flowers blended with sink scum is not entirely pleasant. My hands seem drier, too.I despise brands that pretend to be ""eco-friendly"" and ""natural"" just to make an extra dime off the gullible."
1,I disregarded the negative reviews by mistake.,The sent of this Lemon Verbena dish soap is really disturbing. I love natural Lemon Verbena paste and find this nauseates me. I asked the kids to use it and find that I want to leave the house if anyone is using it. I agree that it takes a long time to get the smell off your hands. I would advise avoiding this brand.
5,YUM!,"I love the way this smells. Plus it works. I have tried other all natural dish soaps that leave my whole sink of dishes greasy and not clean. Not this product, this is good for the enviroment, good for my nose and good clean fun! Great stuff."
1,Faulty pumps,Soap is fine but I have had three faulty pumps which leaked soap and would leave a mess on the sink until the bottle was empty. Very frustrating. I don't intend to buy this product again.
4,I have had almost zero problems with this,"This product has performed as expected for me and I have not had the software problems that some others obviously have experienced. I have also found the product easy to use and it works perfectly with my laptop. I had some issues with setup, but nothing that I could not solve myself with some general monkeying round. I have about 16GB of music loaded on mine and it works fine every time I use it. My only complaints are battery life seems a bit short and the manual is not very good. Also, I agree that the design is not as attractive as the ipod. Overall I'm very satisfied."
1,Raising the bar for overhyped garbage,"Samsung is truly adventurous for riding an MP3 player on the Napster 2.0 name. If this device is any indication of the service, however, I'm not holding my breath. The YP-910GS looks about as well as it performs, small but sloppy. The buttons are about as unintuitive as possible, with an interface to match. The ""features"", save recording which I was unable to test, are pointless and cheap (The FM transmitter and receiver both subpar), and I had difficulty with even basic song playback. Napster, look how far have you come since your roots. Shawn Fenning would be disgusted."
5,a question about this player,"It says that this player seamlessly intergrates with napster, but can u just download songs to the player without napster if you already have existing songs on your computer?"
2,Really Junky. Stick with an iPod,The antenna is worthless.Transferring songs MUST be done through the Napster software and it reuploads the ENTIRE list everytime you want to update music. It's a real pain. You cannot just copy and paste mp3's to the player. Song lists cannot be created on the fly and this is needed for a player that holds 5000 songs
5,Certainly a winner,"I researched this product in the magazines and here on Amazon. The only negative reviews were found here and I took them with a grain of salt as they were obviously written by iPod fanatics. When a reviewer says the Samsung Napster player ""does not work at all"" or ""it fell apart"" and then suggests that I buy an iPod, I have to seriously doubt the genuiness of the review.In any event, the player is great and I have nothing to add except how to get the best price.At Best Buy they have the player for $399 and you get 20 free tracks on Napster.On Amazon you can get it through J&R Music world for $399 and it comes in a couple of days or you can order it from Amazon for $379 and it comes in a week or two. I don't know if you order through Amazon or J&R if you get the 20 free songs.Find the best price and get this superb player."
2,Do not waste your time,"This gets 2 stars because I really liked the hardware. Problem is, the software is from Napster and the hardware is from Samsung and even though they say they are in ""partnership"" the software doesn't work with the hardware at all.Simple things like ripping a CD to the Samsung is a nightmare. The software acts like it's pulling CD data from CDDB, but it's not. You either get a garbled mess, or nothing. Even though the manual says that you can build a play list on your computer and then drag and drop it to the Samsung, you can't. In order to do practically anything, you have to sign in to Napster first.And, of course, when you call for technical support, Napster blames Samsung and Samsung blames Napster. Both are pretty clueless.Just get a standard MP3 player and forget about this Napster/Samsung stuff."
2,I'm taking my Samsung YP-910 back for a refund,"Pro's1. Easy to operate2. Plays both MP3's and WMA's3. Built in FM transmitter to play music through vehicle antenna4. Plenty of storage space5. Good sound quality through headphones6. 20 ""free"" songs from Napster7. Nice visual appealCons1. FM transmitter (not radio receiver)is too weak, sometimes the sound quality is worse than AM radio (6 foot range between car antenna and unit if you are lucky)2. The FM transmitter is especially degraded while charging in vehicle3. I have been unsuccessful in attempts to remove music from the unit.4. No ability to creat playlists without hooking unit back up to computer.Impression: I don't care for Apple products much my friends IPOD seems to work much better for my purposes"
2,"Terrible FM transmitter, no 12volt adapter available","The FM transmitter is worthless. There isn't a 12 volt cigarette adapter available in the US per Samsung. Mine didn't work with songs purchased from Napster, a real problem. The backlight is not adjustable and too dim to really help in a car at night. Would not recommend."
5,Amazing-blows Ipod off its pod,"I've read the glowing Associated Press, Time, Newsweek and other reviews of this player prior to purchasing it. I also read the reviews here which are mostly good except for those written by paranoid Apple Ipod owners.This player has every feature that the iPod has-I know because I own one- and more.The price is the same but the difference is that the Samsung player ties in to the superior Napster service which has just launched.The USB works fast, the player works well in the car. Sounds great A++++"
1,Terrible Product - DON'T BUY IT!,"Don't buy this over-priced piece of electronic junk. The FM radio has poor reception, the FM transmitter is worthless, the unit crashes after importing mp3 files (duh!, this is what this piece is suposed to do!), has to be reset multiple times to get it to power up after a crash, etc, etc.I bought one only to returned TWICE and finally to get my money back."
2,I wish that I had read Walter Mossberg's WSJ review,"From Mossberg's review:The program refused to install properly on two Dell computers, and crashed them. Even when it did install properly on a third machine, it failed to import all of the songs I selected, and to transfer all the songs I wanted to the Napster portable player. The company promises to fix these problems by the service's launch date, a week from Wednesday. Other limitations will persist, however. While Napster is a pretty good music store, it's a lousy jukebox. It can't rip CDs to music files, and it has only rudimentary jukebox capabilities. It can't download music to any portable player but its own. It doesn't work with the iPod and, if you have other players, you have to launch Windows Media Player, a separate program, to transfer Napster downloads to them."
1,WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU PEOPLE THINKING?!?!?!?!,GET A SONY NET MD WALKMEN!!!!!!!!!! WAY BETTER!!!!!!!!!
3,Will everyone please stop comparing this to the iPod?,Every single review has either said:***** This thing is great!!! Much beter than the iPod!!!or* This thing sucks. the iPod is much beter.will someone please just tell me what is good about this player and what is bad? And please for my sanity don't mention the iPod.
3,I dont't own this,"All this iPod and iTunes vs Napster debate is kinda funny. It seems like the only people posting reviews for this product are Apple and Samsung empolyees. Nothing can be this good or this bad. I can tell you what I do know though. The iRiver ihp-120 offers all the features of the Samsung in a package just as small and even lighter than the iPod for a price fifty bucks less than both of these products. In my experience with digital audio, iRiver is the company to go with for both value and performance. Even if the player is extremely difficult to get your hands on, its worth it to check out. By the way, firmware upgrades will soon support the .aac used by iTunes."
1,"nice try, lousy software","Purchased a new Napster and when it works it's okay and the FM transmitter is a nice idea which works okay in my area with few competing stations. Very limited range.The software really sucks. For $300 and with 20GB of space they should have made it so you can load software and edit the data more easily. Software hangs very easily and if anything happens while you're loading it, guess what; you get to start all, over!It takes forever and a day to load too and you have to be careful because the little green bars that are supposed to be showing your songs being loaded are not always accurate. Watch the % reading over on the left in the tree.Manual is lame and there is no support on-line at Samsung.com.I'd give this one a no-go. I suspect many of the 4 and 5 star reviews out there may not be the real thing."
5,"Satisfied, Great product",Got one of these players today at Best Buy as they were out of the iPod. Can't complain I am using the napster service and for the same price as a 20GB Ipod I got a 20 GB Samsung player with 20 free Napster downloads and some nice extra features not found on the iPod.
1,Major Disappointment,"This player is terrible. The software kept crashing my system and was difficult to use. The interface is nowhere near as intuitive as the iPod. Yes it does have a radio. Yippie. And with 20 GB of space for your music and your own playlists do you really think a measly radio is going to make this player stand out. Yeah maybe like a sore thumb. (which you may actually get after using your thumb on those tiny little buttons.) I returned mine and bought a 40GB iPod. With iTunes for Windows, the iPod is by far the best mp3 player out there. Don't take my word for it. Try the two of them out for yourself before making this large of an investment and compare them. The iPod is better in every respect."
5,WOW!,"I received my new player and I'm not one bit disapointed. The players sound is great, even the radio works good. I appreciate the looks, navigation and the cool blue lights and animations. You just have to take a spin with this one! Its an all around winner!"
1,AAAAAARGH,"Like every other electronic device, I've lost the charger. I figure not problem since this device has a USB charger intereface. But wait, it DOESN'T WORK. You seem to have to use their SPECIAL charger interface which of course I can't find anywhere.Oh well. This device locks up after a few songs. Time to buy an IPOD I guess."
4,great,irecieved this player for x mas and is prety good .However it does not store 20 gigs but only 18.6 gig. the software is pretty good and the 20 free songs you get is good but really hard to find here is the info if you want your 20 freetracksTo redeem your 20 free songs:Sign in to Napster with your member name and password.For the Napster standalone program:Go to Account Status from the My Account menu.Click on the link provided for Samsung Napster Track Redemption.Provide the serial number from the back of your Samsung Napster Player.For the Windows Media Player Plugin:Click the Options button and then the Account Status link.Click on the link provided for Samsung Napster Track Redemption.Provide the serial number from the back of your Samsung Napster Player.
1,"UNRELIABLE PRODUCT, GREAT TECH SPECS","I BOUGH THIS UNIT AT BEST BUY 2 WEEKS AGO AND HAD TO RETURNED AFTER DOWNLOADING A FEW SONGS. THE UNIT WOULD JUST NOT BOOT-UP AND THE BLUE LIGHT ON THE FRONT BUTTONS REMAINS LIGHTED. NO SCREEN, NO MUSIC, NO NOTHING.AFTER SPENDING 3 HOURS ON THE PHONE WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE AT SAMSUNG WITH NO RESULTS, I DECIDED TO EXCHANGE THE UNIT THINKING IT WAS A HARDWARE PROBLEM. THE NEW UNIT HAD THE EXACT SAME ISSUE, IT WORKED LIKE A CHARM OUT OF THE BOX, BUT AS SOON AS I IMPORTED SOME MP3 SONGS INTO THE UNIT, IT STOPPED WORKING!. I'M A COMPUTER EXPERT SO I KNOW I DID NOTHING WRONG. I RECOMMEND TO BUY A PROFESIONAL PRODUCT (SUCH AS THE iPOD) AND DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR ENERGY ON A BAD PRODUCT WITH IMPRESSIVE SPECS."
1,Cheap,"This thing is cheap. It feels cheap, I am afraid it might fall apart every time I pick it up. Don't waste your money on this, get an iPod."
5,A Player and More!,So many features including a voice recorder! Its slightly lighter than the iPod and the battery lasts at least an hour longer than the iPod.You can record from the radio which is great for pre announced broadcasted live concerts.You can use the Napsung player in your car without having to buy a special adaptor.You can drag and drop from Napster.All in all very pleased I got the Napsung player and NOT the clunky Ipod.
4,An overview of Maslow not necessarily what I was looking for,"The book is okay but I wouldn't spend a huge amount of money on it if you see it for sale unless you are just looking for an overview. Maslow's seminal works can be located through certain databases if you're in school for psychology so I wouldn't look for books first if you're looking for specifics. I bought this book thinking it was about the work Maslow did after he received his doctorate. However, I found that book after I had already purchased this one and then found his work when searching in some APA databases which essentially made both purchases unnecessary! Sucks to be me eh? Just wanted people to be aware if they're looking for specific works they should look elsewhere. Although the book isn't bad it may not be what you need."
4,Great seat at a great price,"We narrowed down our choices to this one and the baby papasan chair. We ended up choosing the JOY bouncer because it was $15 cheaper. I'm happy with the decision. The chair is sturdy and comfortable. It uses C batteries, but uses them very gently, so you don't have replace them often."
2,Does not fit,"I received the item and was pleased to find that the product is sturdy (I had previously used the tupperware cup shake and lasted for a few years, until I accidently grinded the top cover). However, this new tupperware cup shake took me a good few mininutes to forcefully fit the lids (one for the cup, and the other one for the top lid) initially because they did not fit. And it continues to give me hard time to close it each time I open to drink out of it. I'll return the item."
5,Great for making salad dressing,I have one of these and it really makes my ranch dressing so creamy. I use it to make my own ranch (with the Hidden Valley packets) and it just comes out so much more creamy than using another method.
1,Lid way too tight for the container,"Total ripoff. The lid is too tight for bottle. At this moment, I can not use this item and i consider this item trash."
2,The lid is way too tight,"my main problem with this cup is the lid is absurdly difficult to get on. I was amazed at how much trouble I had considering this is a name brand cup. I suspected the problem could be me, so I handed it off to a male to see if he would have equal trouble as well - and he did.The cap on top of the lid takes so long to coax into place that the only way I've deemed this cup usable is to just leave it closed all the time. Other than that the cup seems to be fine. The markings (c, oz, and ml) are clear and readable. It is also easy to clean (if using protein powder it is probably best to rinse it out right away), though I cannot say how it fares in a dishwasher. If you do not want a cup that is a hassle to put together and you are just making simple shakes, you will probably want to look elsewhere."
4,Quick Shake Container,"I have been using my Quick Shake Container for more than 8 years. I think it is one of the best kitchen items I have ever purchased. It mixes any thing liquidy in constence very well.The lid and snap closure are still in perfect condition. I never have any trouble cleaning it. I use a little bit of soap and hot water.One downside: is that the 2 cup measurements printed on the plastic cyclinder have rubbed off after such long use.To reslolve: I took a permanent marker and wrote the measurements on the cyclinder, fix that problem. NO need to buy another one.Hope this helps"
3,the older ones are better,"I've been using an antique one of these (about 15 years old, in bright yellow) for about five years. It's perfect for mixing up and pouring pancake, waffle, or crepe batter. The markings on the old one were long gone, though, so when I found the new ones on sale, I jumped at the chance to save myself the trouble of washing a measuring cup too.Unfortunately, the flip cap on the new one is much flimsier than on the old one - and because it's not really stiff, it's really hard to snap on to the spout. Tupperware is usually really good about design issues, so I'm not sure why they missed this. But I've gone back to the older one."
3,"Works fine, could be better!","What, are some of you on the Tupperware payroll? It's a good product, but not great. Strong points: The cup itself is sturdy and has good measuring indicators. Weak points: The two-piece cap portion is too flimsy and doesn't snap into place as crisply as it should. It doesn't rinse as well as I would have hoped, so you need a brush to get all the protein powder particles out of nooks and crannies. All in all, I should have bought one, not two. But I wish there was a competing product from Rubbermaid! And you can have it in any color you want, as long as it's blue."
2,Tupperware shakers,"Not pleased. Shaker lid and spout lid are so tight they are almost impossible to close, rendering it unsafe for shaking. Would not buy again nor recommend."
2,Preietita y la Llorona,"Overall, I enjoyed the book, but it lacked the ""magic"" that most Latin American folktales have. The use of imagery could have been better and the ending left readers hanging. Not the best depiction of the true Llorona."
2,At least the illustrations are good,"The good news: it's a feminist version of the La Llorona story. The Bad news: it's BORING!! In order to make it more woman-friendly, the author took all the suspense and horror out of the story. The result is only slightly interesting. But, hey, at least the illustrations are good . . ."
4,difficult lid,The lid to the pitcher is very difficult to put on. But once it is on the flip feature works well.
2,What Were They Thinking?,"This CD isn't something you'd want to listen to more than once. It's a concept CD with an idea. The music is basically here to serve the idea and not be music made up of songs that stand alone or are even ""songs"" in the traditional sense. I guess you need to know the band going in. I heard one song from this CD on the radio that I found interesting so I bought the CD and now I will sell the CD and not miss it at all."
1,Bad,"Not a problem with the product, but I try to return this item, because want to get another ball which I was going to pay them MORE money and the company was NOT able to give me a return LABEL.Very poor customer service NOW somebody else is getting my business."
5,Great for back support,This was recommended by a Physical Therapist for my son's back problem. To help posture.
5,Mead maintains high standards,"Stylistically, this is somewhere between ""Mine and Yours"" and ""Indiana"", with typically crafted songs, sensitive arrangements and superb singing. Singer/songwriters don't come any better thasn David Mead and he's long overdue a lot more success. This CD is especially worth having since it's so cheap! There's lot's more info about him including guitar tabs etc at www.dreamawaythemiles.com and www.mineandyours.com, as well as his official site www.davidmead.com."
5,true blue - the very best`,"I love this music, I have the original cassettes of all these songs but having them all on CD's is great. His ballads are wonderful. If you listen to John Denver you will love this too."
3,Not exact fit,After installation I noticed that the Camco replacement vent cover does not fit the Jensen frame. The corner radius is different. The gasket won't seal because of this. I use an over cover. Hopefully it won't leak.
4,Tupperware Marinating Container,I'm sorry but I thought I ordered a Blue Tupperware Marinating Container. I received a Red one.Denise
4,Lena Jones Returns with a Vengeance,I am a big fan of Betty Webb because she not only offers a great detective story with a strong female protagonist but also embeds various social issues within her stories as well. The most compelling part of the DESERT SHADOWS plot lies not within the mystery itself but within the mysterious background of Lena Jones. I find the hints about her past the most interesting part of the book and I can't wait to find out more!
5,Fun Music!,"I learned the ""Next Generation"" theme and had my brother read Captain Picard's lines. It was fun. I played on the organ and did the bass notes in the pedal. Doing that left me with two hands to play the treble lines. The upper part would be very hard to play with one hand. It was very fun to play on the organ at least."
5,Perfect for any dish.,"I hesitated about buying this product, but still went ahead because I needed a food processor and also a blender. The Smartpower Duet doesn't get any better than this.I've used the blender part to make daiquiries, pina coladas, milshakes, etc. They come out perfect in texture. I've also used the food processor part to make baby food and it comes out so smooth (no lumps), chopping onions, slicing tomatoes and cucumbers, grating cheese. Well basically it satifies every need you may have in the kitchen. My final grade: A+"
3,Could be better,"I bought my Duet about 4 years ago, mostly because it was a Cuisinart.Blender: The blender has served me very well, but I plan to replace it because I believe the shape is a design flaw. The wide base makes for incomplete mixing, so you get chunks of fruit, ice, etc. left behind in an otherwise smooth mixture. I'm shopping now for a blender that's narrower at the base.Food Processor: I was careless with the food processor base & got water inside it, so be careful washing!! After replacing that part, I still agree that it is WAY TOO LOUD. It worked alright, but now that I have a full-size Cuisinart, I will never use it again.I plan to give my Duet to my little sister, who doesn't have a food proicessor or a blender, but I'll tell her to use ear plugs."
3,"Worked solid for 2 years, then broke. Cuisinart fixed it though.","I bought the joint blender and the food processor. It works really well for about 2 years. Then the food processor simply stopped working. The motor moved but it did not slice or grate anything. It somehow lost power. So we started to use only the blender. Then the plastic housing of the blade cracked. This got water leaking in the motor and the rubber gear starting wearing off. So basically it's a gone case.I have bought a lot of cheaper blenders before and none of them lasted long. I thought a more expensive one like Cuisinart would have better life. But I guess not.However, Cuisinart did replace the blender. I had to pay the shipping both ways, but that was cheaper than buying a new blender. I took one month to get the new blender."
2,Nice looks but ...,"I got this blender as a Christmas gift 1 1/2 years ago. It looked very nice and the glass jar and base were sturdy. I used it mainly for smoothies (and Margaritas over the summer; used the food processor part just a couple of times). However, I noticed that just after a few uses, it began struggling, to the point that I was adding one fruit at a time or one or two ice cubes at a time, not to bog down the motor which seemed to be in CHF. Recently, it just died ...Now, I am in the market for another blender. After reading many reviews, I am going to purchase another Cuisinart (SB-5600). I'll keep you posted."
2,Waste of Money,"I read the reviews on this pretty thoroughly before purchasing it. I did check the plastic base of the pitcher - and like someone else mentioned, I too found a hairline crack. I called the company and they gave me no problem - they are sending a new one. I have still used it a few times, and it seems to work great. We are very happy with it so far - it is a million times better than our last blender.UPDATE: The blender only lasted a year before we had the same problem as many others - the blade seized up and tore the bottom to shreds. They sent us a replacement, requesting that we return the broken blade.... Six months later the exact thing happened to the replacement blade. In addition, the food processor had issues that caused damage within the first few weeks."
2,"Decent, but way too loud","I bought this so I'd have 2 appliances in 1 without taking up too much space in my kitchen, but I now wish I would have just opted for higher quality separates. Both the blender and food processor work well enough (although I have a tendency to overfill the food processor's small capacity bowl, but that is a personal issue), but the real problem I have is with the noise. I use the food processor more than the blender (which is a tad quieter) and I literally have to leave the room if I am going to run it for more than 30 seconds or so. It is so loud it makes my ears ring if I stand beside it while it runs. I don't think I have a defective unit, however I haven't contacted Cusinart to complain so I don't know for sure. I find myself not using it as often as I would like to due to the noise. I have a 6 month old and a 2 year old and it makes both of them cry when it runs (neither are scared of the vacuum or any other noisy appliance)."
4,OverAll Good,I would have given this product 5 Stars but Motor make too much Noise. other than that this is good BUY and get the JOb Done
2,Sofa King Loud,"I've had mine for 2-3 months, and I've used it maybe 10 or so times. So far it has continued to work for me, although there are plenty of reviews suggesting the life of the unit is pretty short. I'd have to say my biggest complaint is that hearing protection is needed if you intend to use it as a food processor. Without exaggerating, it makes my ears ring after less than a minute of use. I know that food processors and blenders are inherently louder than regular appliances, but this is louder than most lawn mowers."
3,Not bad..... but,"I used my Duet Blender/Processor primarily for making protein shakes each morning, and it worked fine for about 2 years. Then the bearings in the base began to malfunction making the blender work very hard to turn the blade. So, I checked with Cuisinart about a replacement blade unit. The price of $15 didn't seem bad, but then they wanted $10 more to ship it to me. You can buy the whole unit for about $80 these days, so I can't justify spending 1/3rd of the cost of the whole unit for just that small item. I'm a bit concerned about many of the other reviews when I think about how much longer this unit might last even if I do buy the new part. I'm going to go out and see what's on the market."
1,Burned out after 8 months!,"This duet blender seemed just dandy until I started blending shakes daily, using ice. Then it went to hell in a hurry. It burned right out, despite having an ice setting. Smoke issued from the bottom and it was too scary to use anymore."
1,Lasted about four months...,"Geez where to start with this horrible object:The blender assembly is plastic and breaks easily ... within four months of daily use in our case.The base of the jar has a sharp taper that creates a void around the blades, meaning frequent stops to jam food down into the blades.Smells like ozone.Sounds like a lawnmower.Avoid."
1,worst appliance I've ever owned,"What a piece of junk! I used it maybe four or five times before it broke. I bought it at Costco so I will be taking it back. It is also bone-shatteringly loud, and blends very slowly. Stay away."
2,Loudest appliance EVER,"Had high expectations for this brand-name product. Pretty disappointed. The single biggest drawback is the noise. The blender is so loud it scares our pets into hiding. A small jetliner taking off in our kitchen is about the best way to describe it. And for the money, it really doesn't perform above and beyond the most average of blenders/processors. Blending isn't click and go, I find I have to constantly adjust the speed and check the contents a few times and go again before achieving the results I want. Also, while blending or processing, it gives off a slight smell of burning metal -- even after two years of use. As soon as we can garage sale this thing, I'll be buying something else. Something much, much quieter."
1,Would not buy it again,"Hi,I have had this for over 2 years now..initially it worked ok..but after about 2 years it started having lots of issues..very loud noise..pieces of black seem to come out of the base motor..finally the base stopped working completely..."
5,I love it!!!,"I've had this item for about 6 months. I absolutely love it! It blends very well and I use the food processor almost every day. it is very easy to put together and to clean. It made my life so much easier! I even made doe in it. I set it on stir function and it did just fine. yes, it's kind of loud, but what do you expect from a food processor? It's worth it when I don't have to do all the work manually.Overall, great value for the price. I recommend it."
5,Everything I wanted,I love the blender/food processor. I use it daily for protein shakes and fruit smoothies and it does a great job blending up anything from bananas to ice cubes. It is not too loud and it is ver versatile. I love it and I would buy it all over again. The price is great for what you get.
4,Pleased so far,"I was surprised to learn that I had not purchased this from Amazon but it must have been another online site. So far, for the past year, I've used the blender with no problems. I don't use it often and have used the food processor once. That's a pain. You have to either use the blade or the slicer/shredder, you cannot use both at once or, more importantly, store both in the bowl. Very inconvenient. I've used wide scotch tape to cover the blades and tape to the bowl so the pieces don't get lost. That's another thing, you have to use a little white connector for the slicer/shredder. Be careful not to lose that little plastic part or you're screwed. DON'T LOSE THE LITTLE WHITE CONNECTOR PIECE! I've been very pleased with the blender. If it burns out I will simply buy a new one but I will not buy ""the duet"" I will buy separate appliances. It's worth what I paid for it at the time over a year ago and the blender works very well. VERY Powerful!"
1,Caveat Emptor,Product worked well for the few times we used it in the nine months before it crashed. Read your warranty! You pay return shipping plus send a check for $10.00. Our first Cuisinart Processor/Blender was great for 10 years. Of course it was made by Cuisinart in th US. Now the company is owned by Conair (has always produced junk) in China. Caveat Emptor! Enough Said.
1,the food processor makes a TERRIBLE noise,"When selecting the food processor tab is noise is awful , is even painful for you ears , I have to use ears protectors"
2,Horrible customer service,"I purchased the SmartPower Duet blender/food processor FPB-5 series 3 months ago and loved it. Easy to use and I did use it daily..it's the perfect size. In making my morning smoothie something in the base/motor ""clinked"" ..I could hear pieces of metal rolling around inside, but it still worked...although it made strange noises. I knew it was a matter of time before it stopped working so I called Customer Service and they informed me I would have to send it to NJ, at MY cost, and enclose a $10 check for it's return if they could fix it. I purchased a Cuisinart product in good faith and because of my history with other products from them. NO MORE!"
4,does the job,this blender/ food processor is good. I have been using it for almost a year and it is still working like new. The blender will make great smoothies and crush ice just fine. it is loud and it will take a few minutes to get perfectly smooth drinks
1,Cheap parts & wont last long,"My wife and I bought one of these, and the food processor broke within a few weeks. The plastic piece that turns the blade was made out of cheap plastic and just snapped in half. We returned it, and made the unfortunate mistake of buying a new one thinking that the cuisinart reputation was good enough to give them another chance thinking that maybe we just got a bad unit... The new one also wasn't that great, and we stayed away from the food processor attachement. the blender was loud, and would leak when we would pour the shakes out. It finally just broke again today after only a few months of use. The rubber piece at the bottom that turns the blades has stripped and is now broken. Were going to try an return it again, but either way we will not be buying a new one."
4,"great blender, just loud","I have been using this blender every day for the past 8 months or so and it's going strong. I love it. It chops quite nicely and blends my fruit smoothies quite well. I don't put ice in mine, so i can't attest to how it chops that up. I'd say my only complaint about it is how loud it is! But if you can live with that for a few seconds while it blends, it's a great blender. Looks nice, cleans easily. Thick, sturdy glass jar.One warning: this is my second one. I had to return the first one I bought from Costco because at one point the bottom was screwed on so tight, there was no way it was coming off. This made it impossible to disassemble and clean properly. This happened after a few weeks so it maybe it was defective. I haven't had that issue with this one and like I said I've had it for 8 months."
2,Great ... Except for Smoothies,I agree with many of the other reviews - Our blender worked beautifully until we began using it to make smoothies. We replaced the gear drive once and it broke again. I think that the plastic just is not strong enough to withstand the strain of making smoothies with frozen fruit over time. We have replaced it with an old fashioned blender with metal parts that I found at an outlet store and it has worked wonderfully.
5,Great experiences with this blender,"This is the best blender I've ever owned. It's up to the challenge of ice, which is great because I love smoothies. I've had it for almost 2 years. Every other blender I've owned has died...this one's a survivor."
1,"High Promise, Low delivery","I bought this as I liked all the bells and whistles. I used it lightly for only one season. The it went caput. No one would fix it as it was not worth fixing. Now I have all the ""bells and whistles"" occupying my kitchen space. Typical ""made in China"" cheap junk. Save your money and go elsewhere."
1,"Run, don't walk, away from this product!","I thought I was killing two birds with one stone when I placed this combo on my wedding registry. I can honestly say, it's the only thing I absolutely hate that I asked for. It is loud, ineffective, and the processor never really worked. Did I say loud? I'm not kidding when I tell you that my ears HURT when I use it! I wish I had never given up my old Kitchenaid blender. I finally threw away the processor parts and ordered the Kitchenaid KFP750. I will also toss the blender when I buy a new one. I won't even donate it. I wouldn't do that to any charitable organization!"
5,Brilliant Blender,"This is a great blender, it does the job very very well, its fast, and its got the food processor on it, for someone who lives on the South beach diet, this is amazing. Smooths, purees, mashed cauliflower, and the occasional drink!"
3,Cuisinart SmartPower Duet,"The glass jar for the blender is too heavy. The plastic cup for the processor is too small and all the parts are fragile. The motor is too noisy and sometimes it smells like if it were burning. The product is good for casual use. It doesn't have any replaceable parts. This mean you HAVE to be very cautious while using it and washing it, in order to keep your investment worthwhile."
1,Great disappointment,I bought this appliance and was shocked to find out that the plastic part that turns the machine was cracked and unable to be used. I have not been able to use the product at all.
1,OK while it lasted,This is my 4th blender - This blender lasted 30 days - luckily under the 60 day warranty. We have smoothies once a day and the moter burned out. Is there a blender out there that can handle smoothies??!!
1,Well...,"I really liked it until the motor gave out. I haven't put particularly heavy use on it, but have used it fairly regularly and liked the results. It is somewhat problematic trying to get everything to mix thouroughly if you don't add a fairly substantial amount of liquid, but that is typical for a blender. Also, it is loud, but also at a level typical for a blender.My BIG problem with it is that Cuisinart will be glad to replace the motor but I have to pay to ship it to them and then pay them $10 to ship it back. What kind of lousy warranty policy is that? Granted, compared to the $120 sticker price, it is probably worth it, but it is almost a quarter of what it would cost to buy the the thing once the discounting from the online retailers is taken into consideration. It has shown itself to be an unreliable product and Cuisinart doesn't stand behind it. What a combination!"
1,Leaky Blender and Super Loud Food Processor!,"I've owned this blender / food processor combo for less than 2 years and I'm about to get rid of it. The blender has been leaky for over a year now and I rarely use the mini food-processor as it's extremely loud and inefficient. Neither item works well and this was money totally wasted. I'm disappointed in this brand with my experience. I own other Cuisinart products that work really well, including the 14-cup good processor which I love. Not sure what happened with this product, but it should be discontinued!"
4,"Had it for 2.5 years, still works great","I received this as a Christmas present a couple of years ago, use it about once a week and it works very well.I don't put anything through the dishwasher, and completely disassemble the glass blender bit to make sure everything cleans well. Doing this, everything is still in great condition, no cracks, no breaks, no weird smells.Pros:- Works very efficiently, easy to store, and it's great to have a blender/food processor all in one.- Perfect size for a two-person household- Grater and slicer work great as well!Cons:- VERY loud- Retractable cord is a bit of a wrestle to get back in, but it's nothing terribly dramatic.Overall, a good tool to have in the kitchen."
1,It can not be said enough!,"Regardless of any of this product's attributes, it is absurdly, hideously and dangerously loud! What's the deal with that?"
2,wow they were right,"I thought really how bad can a blender be. We they were right VERY LOUD. I think do to it being plastic not a metal base. 1st time using the food chopper, which was the first day i bought it, I chopped a few onions - took of the lid to set in sink, put it back on to chop some more and it wouldn't work. I thought WHAT - why? I looked in the top of the lid and the stem that triggers the blade to spin when the lid is attached was not there. It was laying in my sink. OH MY WORD - can you imagine if it would have fallen off in what I was chopping plastic pieces everywhere. Why is this piece not actually made into the lid - why is it a separate piece which comes unglued and falls out. Terrible design. Be for warned. Not sure what other blender is good that also has a food processor. That is why i bought this. It was on sale but still for the price at Kohls over $100 NOT WORTH it. plastic junk"
1,doesn't do what it is supposed to do,"I've had this for a couple of years. I'm a big fan of smoothies. Although the blades are still sharp, never once did I have a perfectly smooth result with this machine. The authorized Cuisinart repair shop I took it to said it is because the blades are housed in too deep."
