3,comprhensive financial mathematics subject,good explantion with examples.answers at the end of problems.almost all related topics of financial mathematics.it need more organizing.
2,master of none,"Kind of silly I suppose, expecting a single book to give a decent overview of all the aspects of te creative suite, but that's what I was hoping for. It's basically an introduction to the adobe creative suite, rather than a 'bible'. I have to say, I find it rather ineffective, trying to learn all these things at once, and the basic theme of the book, 'interconnectivity' is simple enough that you really don't need a book.I'm also a bit bothered by how much they seem to want to sell the idea of the adobe creative suite. There is no mention of other tools available in places where they admit adobe's products have shortcomings.Also, the paper is poor quality (what did I expect for the price?!).That said, if you're looking for a generalist, get your feet wet kind of hand-holding book, this could be a good one to buy, the examples are clear and easy to follow."
4,Lowepro Laptop Backpack,"Fits my Lneovo T60 perfectly, and still leaves enough room for a few legal pads or small notebooks. Backpack fits well on my back when riding my motorcyle, which is one of the main reasons I went with a backpack. A little short on cubbys and pockets, but still does what I need it too. The Orange/Grey interior make it easy to find ""stuff."" Well worth the purchase."
5,Conditions hair at a reasonable price,"Suave Conditioner works like it should - conditions hair and rinses out cleanly with no residue. It's also priced reasonably, so it's a winner in our household."
1,It was a bad idea for them to change the formula!,"I used this product for years and often received compliments on my long, healthy hair. Now they have a ""new"" version of this conditioner and my hair is always frizzy and full of static. Even my husband has noticed that this new product does nothing good for my hair. I really miss the old version and wish they would bring it back. Until they do, I'll be looking for another product. I would love to let the company know my thoughts, but I could not find any place on their website to do such a thing. Therefore, I am sharing my thoughts with everyone in the hopes that they will get the message."
4,528 - wooo hoooo...,It's a very nice musical CD. You just have to listen to it to appreciate it. Absolutely fascinating...
2,"Frequencies ""CD""","Service was OP but Ican't rate the Frequencies '""CD"" becausethe same Same comments as for Deep Theta apply.. Are these disks faulty if not they should be advertised as MP3 not CD."
5,Spiritual Healing Music,"Jonathan Goldman is a master at composing spiritual healing music. His music is entrancing; it draws you in like a magnet and gives you a nearly instant feeling of inner warmth, peace and relaxation. His music is beautiful, perfect for meditation, sleep or relaxation."
5,Wonderful!,"I love this cd, it is so relaxing and a great addition to my meditation music. I highly recommend it."
2,Another cookbook without photos?!,"It's killing me! Recipies are not complicated enough, wines are not difficult enough to get a hold of, figuring out american measurement system and calculating it into metric is not bad enough?Oh yes, let's make it HARDER and let's not include any photos.Jesus and Blessed Virgin Mary!I need pictures in my cookbooks. What the meal is supposed to look like in the end for sure. A ""how to"" strip - even better!I'm gonna be too intimidated by my absolute lack of culinary experience / finesse and lack of pictures in this cookbook to even TRY to use it!Other than that (is there anything left? oh yeah) book is beautifully designed, paper quality is excellent but format is kinda weird (square and rather large) so it sticks out the cookbook shelf."
2,Sophmore Slump,"This novel was a let down. I was especially dissapointed because I really liked Chacon's first book, Chicano Chicanery. In fact I liked the short story collection so much that when And the Shadows Took Him came out I bought a copy right away and enthusiastically began reading. Unfortunately, however, I was only able to get about half way through before being overcome by boredom. I put the book aside, and am just finishing it now-- two years later! In my opinion, the plot is convoluted and the prose flat; there just wasn't much to hold my attention. I think Chacon really hit the sophmore slump with this one. Hopefully he'll be able to recapture the old Chicano Chicanery magic in his next work."
4,Truth as Fiction Aztlan-style,"Daniel Chacon's new novel is good. No, it's good and tiene ganas. While there is some familiarity in the roles being played out by the Familia, ultimately, their fates--especially Joeys and his jefes--are in the shadows.Like Stella Duarte's LET THEIR SPIRITS DANCE, this book pushes the margins of what many consider Chicano Lit. Pick up this new novel, forget what you might know about its author, and remember that we've come a long way, esa."
1,Even my 11 year old said it was 'cheesy',"I purchased last minute when my son said he needed to be dressed as a pilgrim for school 3 days later.....the costume 'worked', but son said it was cheesy.Mysteriously, the hat did not make it back from school!"
3,"A Junior ""Batman Animated""","This book seems to be a BATMAN ANIMATED for a younger audience. It's a useful collection of things related to the first season of BATMAN BEYOND but not as rich as ANIMATED. There are some model sheets, some background paintings, some storyboards, some scenes from the episodes, and a couple of pages from the DC comics, but these things are used only as design elements, not presented as information in themselves. But don't get me wrong. It still has useful descriptions of the Batsuit's capabilities, illustrations of the main characters (including the villains, though Blight, for some reason, gets short shrift), and synopses of the episodes. Personally, I would have preferred more model sheets and some synopses from the second season. I'll hope for another edition that will cover the 2nd/3rd seasons."
5,melancholic rock method of mass seduction,"Honest... headphone rock for the 21st century. Simple but powerful songs heavy on mood and atmosphere. Like the best elements of shoegazer rock, hushed acoustic ambience, bombastic space rock and extended improvised moods, this group focuses on a foundation of hypnosis. The music is both emotionally engaging and mesmerizing, encompassing that ""head in the clouds and feet on the ground"" spectrum. Think Pink Floyd meets The Doves, Elbow meets The Verve, U2 meets early New Order, REM meets My Bloody Valentine..."
4,Soundtrack for a rainy day,"I wake up to this album just about every day.One of the best things about living in Rochester, NY, is that I can see Greg Paul perform fairly regularly, with or without the rest of the Autumdivers. The music is arresting when performed live.I would give this album 5 stars, but I anticipate future albums may be even better."
2,The older they get...,"Boy Rammstein is getting old, in more than one way. This music is boring with none of the power or energy as their older stuff. I liked their fast paced songs which they made up until the album Mutter. But both this new album and last years Reise, Reise aren't that at all. These guys are done."
3,"Not Reise, Reise but still good.","I love Rammstein and have loved them ever since their first album was put on my CD Player long ago. I have followed the band closely and I have to say that this album is a step back from the amazing Reise, Reise. It is not a bad album by any means, but after being a fan for so long, this album just felt... lacking.There are some gems here as Benzin, Zerstoren, Mann Gegen Mann, Rosenrot are some of my favorites. Wo Bist Du I felt was rather weak and Stirb Nicht Vor Mir didn't feel as strong as I thought it should have felt. Maybe using the usual female vocalist would have helped the song.When I heard the song Te Quiero Puta! I couldn't stop laughing as Spanish is my native tongue and I wasn't expecting it at all. Great Spanish accent Till!You might ask me why the low score after I said how I liked it, but I just felt that it couldn't stand on it's own against albums like Sehnsucht and Reise, Reise. Good work overall Rammstein but I expected much better."
4,German Rock,"This is the first Rammstein album I've listened to, being attracted to it in the first place by the single 'Benzin', which constitutes track 1. I wasn't sure what to expect, other than probably more of the same. Rather surprisingly (I felt), I really enjoyed it - less 'Industrial' and more 'Rock' than I expected. I can hear many echoes of decades-old favourites such as Nina Hagen and Spliff.....of course, there's more power chording and the production technology these days is way better, but - German Rock still sounds like German Rock. So if you like the above mentioned Nina Hagen, Spliff et al - you won't get too far out of your comfort zone with this. And it goes without saying - if you're already a Rammstein fan, it may pay you to backtrack & investigate some of the older players in this game, to hear where some of it's coming from.Incidentally, you may enjoy (as I did) putting this album on the headphones, turning the volume up & visiting the Ramstein Air Base homepage."
3,the worst rammstein album,"in germany is this the worst album of rammstein, the lyrics are do not fit, the text resulted in no sense. i think this album and reise reise, are make for the american people. in germany ist this album absolutely ...., the best album are mutter then sehnsucht, then herzeleid and then reise reise and this album,the best german band are the BOEHSE ONKELZ. there have no bad album."
2,The Day Has Gone.....,"Every dog has its day, as they say, and Rammstein seem to have had theirs. For fans of the seriously heavy, powerful industrial sounds of Rammstein, ""Rosenrot"" will probably disappoint.With exception of the track ""Zerstoren"", which is filled with powerful chords and hard riffs, the band seems to have gone for a lighter, cleaned up sound. Most tracks have a softer sound to them, as if Rammstein have tried to change their image and style quite dramatically. Some songs get heavy in the choruses, only to lose that hard edge again in the verses. Sadly, this seems to be the case with every song on the CD.For fans who have been pounded into fan-hood by the sounds of ""Sennsucht"", ""Mutter"", and Herzeleid"", this one is certainly one to avoid. If you buy it, make sure you listen to it first. Maybe the changes will appeal, but for fans of the earlier music, ""Rosenrot"" is really where the ""rot"" has set in.If you were only mildly impressed by ""Reise, Reise"", then steer clear of this one."
2,The Truth,"It's the truth every band will let you down eventually no matter how much you love them. I spent a month tracking down this cd and actually getting it, so my expectations were held high to begin with. But alas, It's nowhere near as good as their others sure the spanish song is pretty amusing, the rest well.. I'm sorry to all those who found it utterly spellbinding. The first song you hear american words randomly which is confusing and yet retarded gasoline, vasoline... Then the love song.....that is by far the worst part of the whole cd..It ruined their whole image for me. So for people who love rammstein and really want to know what they're getting into, I would say wait for it, because I spent more getting the cd into the states than it was worth itself. And very saddened to have to say this about it."
4,A HELL OF A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT CAME BEFORE IT,"I gave up on these guys after the awful Reise Reise. I couldn' stand the lack of guitar, silly samples, random string arrangements that didn't pertain to the songs, ringing snare drums, lack of any lead guitar, no keyboard, just to name a few.This one puts them back on the right track, but they have a long way to go before they ever sound like Herzeleid and Mutter again!"
2,Average at best,"I have been listening to Rammstein for years and saw them in concert a couple of times. This album is no where near as good as the previous albums. All the songs are not as energetic as the ones on the first three albums. I highly recommend that you purchase them first, along with their live album."
5,Ich will mehr!,"Ich will mehr! Ich will mehr! This album is awesome. Though a few slow parts, this is a very solid Rammestein offering. Ich will mehr!"
5,RAMMSTEIN ROSENROT!!!!,"ROSENROT is another great piece of heavy music produced by Rammstein! I really like all the songs, but BENZIN, ROSENROT, SPRING and ZERSTÖREN are high lights! Rammstein is one of the coolest metals i had heard since a long long time...This is first class metal!!!!"
5,"A continuing evolution, but not to dissapoint.","First off, don't expect another Sehnsuct. They have changed slightly in sound, which is too bad, but thats not to say their newer style isn't amazing in itself. If you didn't like Reise, Reise, you probobly won't like Rosenrot all that much either, although I do notice more electronic elements than Reise, Reise, it's still not as abundant as Sehnsuct or Mutter. This really isn't all that heavy of an album either, but still excellent. I'd say go for it, but the other version is definatly better, having the full 11 tracks."
4,It's a little different this time around,"Well, when I first listened to this album, it really ticked me off, because at first, it sounds like Rammstein just put out a mediocre album to generate some revenue. But listen guys, don't give up on Rammstein too quickly! Give the album a few listens before you decided to hate or love it. It's got a lot of slower tracks on this album, but they are all very powerful. The more you listen to their music, the more they grow on you. I'm still not sure if it measures up to Sehnsucht, and Mutter, but overall it rocks, and they as always put 100% of their music passion into their songs."
2,What??,"I must have heard a different album than these other reviewers. Being a fan since the first time I saw them in '98, I've always liked Rammstein's work, but this one's definitely their least impressive, aside from the beautiful packaging it comes in. A couple decent songs, but nothing they haven't already done, and better. It's like a sluggish version of ""Reise, Reise,"" almost all ballads, and the song ""Te Quiero Puta"" is downright embarrassing."
3,too watered down for my taste,"I'm used to the metal, gritty in your face Rammstein. This album is too toned down, and as distinctive as Rammstein vocals are, is starting to sound like your average rock album with no angst and little expresiveness, out only to make a buck. Sorry Rammstein, try again, you've done much better in the past."
2,boring,"The production was well polished and high quality. However, I couldn't help but feel bored listening to it. It almost appears that they are going through the motions musically, while saving their efforts for adolescent lyrics and wild live shows. There are some bits of varied musicality and language, with a slow partially English ballad, and an 'industrial Mariachi' song in Spanish. But, the core seems to be hard hitting without enthusiasm."
3,so so sad,"i love rammstein, dont get me wrong. but this cd is crazy. i strongly dislike it. only a few good songs and the rest are disapointing."
3,half steam ahead,"Personally, I like what Rammstein continues to put out, but I'm more than a little disappointed at how some of the songs on this CD turned out so...generic.Don't get me wrong, I love this band, one of my favorites in fact. I just can't say I love most of the songs on this CD like I do on Sehnsucht, Mutter, or Reise Reise. I'm a fan of their older CD's; full of dark, heavy industrial metal, but not so much of this...I'd go as far as saying white noise on this CD. It reminds me of listening to the radio. Theres a few gems to be heard on the radio, but most is filler and consequently, white noise because it all sounds the same.I did like a few on this CD though. Mann Gegen Mann, Rosenrot, Wo Bist Du, even Don't Die Before I Do, and to a lesser extent, Spring"
3,Nur 3 Sterne... koonte besser sein...,"I only give this record 3 stars out of 5. It could be better. it's quite mellow actually... and I prefer the harder Rammstein. One of the best songs for me is ""Te quiero P***"", even though it's all sung in Spanish, which in itself is kind of funny. The whole song is quite comical, though I don't understand Spanish. I do respect Rammstein in making every album different... no copies of Herzeleid or Sehnsucht or any of the others. They do change up their sound a bit each time, sitll staying true to their roots. But, as I've already said, this CD is quite mellow... their mellowest yet."
4,Good price,Wish it was shipped faster... Price was about half of what I would spend at the health food store. Thanks!
4,Not bad for price.,"I agree with the previous review that it's preety good for the price. Also, most models in this price range do not include Canada in their maps.Some Cons you should be aware of.1. Cannot play mp3 and do gps at the same time.2. Does not include a headphone jack so you can only listen to MP3 on the built in speaker.3. No way to custimize the info that is on the display of the GPS (ex. time, MPH, direction etc....).4. Does not switch display automatically between day and night automatically.5. No way to adjust speker volume without exiting GPS program."
2,Nice when working,"Got this for Christmas. I agree with another person that it has a fairly steep learning curve.My main problem is that it doesn't pick up a satellite when I turn it on. Everytime I get in my carI have to go to the section that searches for a GPS Satellite. It always finds it and then it works.I have clicked on ""Set GPS"" & ""Automatic reconnect"" but it still doesn't connect.Also find their support pretty bad. Very hard to get any kind of answer from them."
1,"Crappy battery, terrible customer support","I bought this crappy system about 6 months ago. The battery died and would not charge. Customer service was non-existent. They sent me to a website that sent me to another website and I still could not find a replacement battery for this system. Save your money, do not buy this piece of garbage. The device is mediocre and will not last. Spend a little more and buy from a real company."
5,Veranda Patio Table & Chair Cover,"The article was better and was delivered quicker than we expected. It also was cheaper than what we could buy through other stores on line. Can not say much more as we have only had it a short while. The prove will be how long it lasts, but it seems sturdy enough to last for awhile. So far we are more than happy with the cover."
5,Excellent Table and Chair Cover,"Great quality at a reasonable price. Very well made. I have the 94"" cover protecting a 60"" round cast table and 5 dining chairs with arms. Has plenty of room to spare. Heavy weight with velcro leg ties keeps it in place during strong winds. Wish they would of put a couple of more velcro ties on it. Solid top so you need to remove umbrella if you want to use it during the season. Strongly recommend this cover."
5,Patio Table Cover,"The Veranda Patio Table cover is much nicer in person than it looks. It's made of quality materials, easy to set-up, and it's pleasant on the eyes. I would purchase this product again. It's the best cover I have ever had and highly recommended."
3,Too small,All my patio furniture is covered with this brand and I love it. Very sturdy and does the job. I have a second seating arrangement and I have just not had luck on getting the correct size. I give it 3 stars as the product is excellent but it doesn't fit. I would never purchase any other brand or style. I live in the north east and get at least 3 season out of the products or more depending upon the types of winters we have and I consider that a very sucessful product.
3,disappointed,I thought the dimensions given would cover the table and chairs. It did not. The cover is great but it only covered the table.
4,Good Long Term Weather Resistance,I purchased this cover over two years ago and it still is in excellent condition. It is fully exposed to weather and sun 24/7. Other less expensive covers I have purchased in the past became brittle and started falling apart after two years of weather exposure.
4,Great,"I have a grill cover made from the same material, could be the same brand for all I know. I've had the grill cover for 3 years now and the only hole was caused by a rabbit chewing on it. This is great for my table which is actually a tall table. It doesn't cover it 100% but it gets 3/4 of the way down. Very easy to use."
3,Missing straps?,"The cover is nice and heavy, but no match for the winds that nearly blew it off the table! I wonder why there are only two straps that secure the cover to the table, or am I using a defective product? Four, one for each table leg, would have been better. The color and texture are good, but mine arrived with a dirty spot on it."
3,cover,"It's a good cover, unfortunately it's a little too small for my table and chair set. The next size up would be too large - oh well."
5,Patio table cover,"Hey, what can I say? If it makes the ""boss"" happy, I am happy. This is a nice looking cover that you will be proud to display. We were very pleased with the heavy duty construction of this cover. I is large enough to cover the table and the chairs."
5,patio table cover,I recieved the cover quickly and it was as described. It is very sturdy and fits perfectly. I am very pleased with the cover.
4,Sturdy yet attractive,"A sturdy and attractive cover that easily covered the table and six chairs. We found the identical item in stores for more money, in some cases much more. We would recommend it highly. Make sure you measure your table and chair combination before you place the order. Read cleaning instructions."
5,Nice Patio Table Cover,"The Veranda Patio and Chair cover is exactly as described. It is a nice, heavy-duty cover that should last several winters at least. It easily fits over a 30"" round table and four patio chairs with a little room to spare."
3,Great cover. Too small (by far),"If you have chairs that hug the table completely and do no protrude at all from the back, this would be an excellent cover. It's just too small for the table and four chairs I have. I was afraid to go one size up, as it seemed far too big, but I should have done so."
2,It all looks good in pictures but in reality it is not sitting on the table as it looks in the picture. The top turns to a small,It all looks good in pictures but in reality it is not sitting on the table as it looks in the picture. The top turns to a small
1,Only lasted 2 years,This cover seemed good at first.I think it should last more than 2 years. I live in NYC not Montana.I gave it a 1 star rating because it was good the first year.It has a number of rips and tears along the seems.For that kind of money it should last a few more years.Save your money and try another brand.I only used it for 2 winters and its already worn out.
5,Just What We Needed,"I had seen this product at the showroom where we purchased our patio table set and where they wanted almost twice the price of Amazon. It is thick and well constructed. We just went through our first major storm for the season (w/2"" of rain) and winds up to 40 mph. This product helded up nicely and did not blow off. It has straps with snaps to hook around legs of tables or chairs. I just ordered the bbq cover and fire pit cover and will definitely use this brand in the future."
5,When you buy covers for your patio furniture online you hope they are as well made as these.,When you buy covers for your patio furniture online you hope they are as well made as these. I've bought other brands of patio furniture covers online before and they don't even last 2 years. The workmanship on these is much better.
5,great value,"excellent quality for the price. i have two other covers that are over a year old, exposed to direct sunlight, and have held up very well.highly recommend."
4,"So far, so good","Have only had this product a month or so, but so far, so good. We have had several wind storms, and the cover stays in place. We have had rain and ice and the water does not accumulate on the cover. The material is nice and heavy. And it is attractive. A plus for me since the cover can be seen from the road. It was a little dirty when I got it out of the box. Hopefully it will hold up for several years."
4,Well made product,"Purchased this to protect a square table and 4 chairs, as could not find a cover specifically for a square table, so it doesn't fit quite like it should, but does the job. Have had several very windy days and cover ties and loops have held well. We will see what happens over the winter."
4,Veranda Round Patio Cover,"The cover is heavy duty fabric and it covers the large table and 6 chairs that I have. The only thing I would like to see is more tie downs. It has 2, but that is not enough for the size of the cover. The wind has blown the cover off once already. We are trying to come up with our own tie downs to secure the cover over the winter months."
3,Well made cover,"I would give this 4 stars for quality and value, but it comes with only 2 clips to secure the cover to the furniture. With strong winds, the cover tends to pull off. You won't lose it, but given the large size of the cover, it really should have 4 clips."
3,smaller than it says in the listing,"It's supposed to fit a table AND CHAIR set ""up to 54 inches."" Well, our table is 47 inches. It will go over the table, but not the chairs. 54"" is the size table it can fit, but with no room for any chairs. The quality appears good, but it's going back. Star rating downgraded for the misleading listing."
4,patio table cover,"Very Nice fabric heavy and durable, nice clasps. Not quite as long as I would have liked to cover the legs only came down about 1/2 the way. I had to order a bigger size the dimesions for ordering may have been off."
5,Veranda Patio Table Cover,"I wanted a cover to protect a new patio set from the weather. This cover is perfect. It covers over 94"" which my set is a round table with six chairs (100""). The fabric is heavy with two draw strings to tighten the hem and two straps to secure to chairs. Since it sagged a little in the middle, I put a huge ball in the center of the table before covering. Now rain will not collect in the center."
4,Very Sturdy Cover,"I bought this cover last December and the result of my winter durability test was excellent.I found it so sturdy and reliable! Since this is a little too big for my furniture set, it covers all almost to the bottom of the furniture legs (it may not look so nice aesthetically.) and although it can be tied only at two points, the cover stayed all the time even under very windy/snowy weather. (Wind even pushed the furniture set all together as if it was one big piece!) So far so good!I did not give the full 5 stars, just because I could not find the best size, and of course, I would like to continue to check the durability for coming years....My patio furniture set is a 48"" table and 5 chairs, but the cover size is large (to 94"" diameter) as the medium (to 70"") seems to be too small to cover the whole set. I guess the bigger the better as there is plenty room to put other things underneath."
3,Patio Cover,Patio table cover was ordered after receiving a great stacking chair cover but disappointed with the length of the cover. Very short. Was hoping the cover would be longer to cover items placed under the table.
5,Humorous and beautiful modern tale,Greene updates the tale of Don Quixote beutifully in this tale of a Quixote-like priest in fascist spain. This book is beuatifully written and deeply touching. I think it is Greene's most underrated novel.
4,"Wine, Wisdom, and Windmills","Listening to Monsignor Quixote, (unabridged on audio casette) I found myself instantly transported into the company of these remarkable characters. Green is a master of both dialogue and symbolism. This is the best G. Green work I have yet experienced."
4,delightful small latter work of Greene's,"A delightful meditation on friendship, as two unlikely heros traverse Spain to purchase Monsignor socks for a colorless priest. His companion is the Communist former Mayor of their small Spanish town, and their conversations and roadside picnics are comments on a Spain that was lost under Franco, impossible to restore under communists, but perhaps recoverable with the Catholic Church militant and incarnate. The story arc follows that of Don Quixote, with Rocinanante as a mercurial but faithful motor car. This is a light, but deep funny story, an ""entertainment"" yes, but also deeply touching the divine spark of humanity."
5,Chaplin at his funniest best!,"This is a hilarious parody of Adolf Hitler(""Adenoid Hynckel""!) and the entire Nazi hierarchy .Chaplin portrays the bumblingly self-important Feuhrer to a T while concurrently playing the role of a Jewish barber (""the tramp"") who is constantly hounded by the stormtroopers .This is slapstick at its finest! Goering is played by the suitably rotund ""Marshal Herring"" while Goebbels is lampooned as ""Herr minister Garbage""! There is even a cameo role for Mussolini (senor Napolioni of ""Bacteria"").Especially funny are Chaplin's spoofs of Hitler's speeches____all ticks and mannerisms included! I don't want to give away the end of this movie( which is sobering) but can tell you that after seeing it you will never be able to watch one of those WW-II documentaries without getting a chuckle out of them!"
4,The Great Dictator,"Good movie, funny, but eye-openening warning of events to come for those who didn't fall into the Aryan race. Good message to all of mankind."
5,A Must Have Classic Comedy Film---Better than anything produced today,"Possibly Charlie Chaplin's best work ever--his Hitleresque character is beyond belief, and the ""Master of the World"" ballet is one every comedy enthusiast should see. This film is also filled with other stars from Paulette Goddard to Reginald Gardner; it has it all and would be an asset to any body's collection."
5,"Charles Chaplin: "" A True Genius""","I have rented several several DVDs and own a few, and never have felt the need to write a review. This is a very special film. I rented this DVD and my wife and I liked it so muich that were are purchasing a copy for our library. I have a son who is almost 11 years old and he was roaring with laughter! He only knows who Adolph Hitler was, and has no idea who the other characters are that are being lampooned. As he grows older and realizes who they are, he will appreciate this film even more. The Chapter X speech is all inspiring, and is as relevant today as it was in 1940. It is as good as any speech that I have ever heard. Jerry Lewis once replied, when an interviewer compared him with Charlie Chaplin, ""There will never be another Charlie Chaplin."""
5,"If you are looking for a Madonna concert video, BUY THIS","""Girlie Show"" is definitely one of the best concert videos I've ever seen. Brilliant instrumental and vocal performance backed up by one of the most spectacular visual shows ever created for a pop concert. Extremely theatrical."
3,Rockin' in Oz,"This has some excellent songs/performances and more that are not so great (which you can skip over). This is NOT a five star performance like ""The Virgin Tour"" (1985) which I thought was five stars and much much better and which I have on VHS. Hopefully, they will produce a comprehensive Madonna DVD which encompasses the whole career in the next year or two."
3,Nothing spectacular,"I expected a lot from this DVD. And for ""a lot"" I mean good sound quality and some kind of screen play.The good side: Madonna is great, as it's his music. The bad side: The making is a disaster. The sound is *nothing* compared to live CDs, there are few cameras, and bad placed.For the people who liked this, check out Tina Turner Live from Amsterdand Arena (if possible, in DTS). That's how a concert should be filmed. And check out Eagles' Hells Freezes Over for sound quality.Really, I didn't expect this DVD to be as good as any of these, but it's *nothing* compared to them. I wish Madonna can get a concert filmed and recorded in the way she deservers."
5,Amazing! Brilliant!,"This has got to be Madonna's best tour, with the exception of the Blond Ambition Tour. It was sad that she couldn't have more dates than just five shows. This show is so brilliantly performed. Madonna must have spent months rehearsing. Everyone should go out and buy this video! It's amazing!!"
4,If you like Broadway shows,"If you like Broadway productions, then you will like this show. Madonna uses this opportunity in this tour to showcase her theatrical talents. If you want to see her in a typical concert performance with just songs and dance, you will be disappointed. Not enough of her hits in this two hour show. But very entertaining as far as showmanship is concerned."
5,The best concert of the 1990's.,"Madonna's 'Girlie Show' seems to represent not only pop music of the 90's, but all the political issues, discriminatory issues, and other popular debatable subjects that were only taboos at the time to even mention. The performances are awesome, and Madonna is the greatest artist on the planet!"
1,Bullsh*it! (for people in south and north america),"ok..so, first off, im not saying the concert was bad because it turns out i can't even watch it. my dvd player wont play it bevause it says it;'s out of region.so if you live on south or north america dont even waste your money. there wasent even a warning or something to alert me."
3,A pretty decent concert but not the best....,"The best concert Madonna has ever done is The Blonde Ambition Tour(not yet available on DVD). Originally shown on HBO, Blonde Ambition (thank god i have a vhs copy) is the best concert she has done so far(covers all her classic hits and has the best stage setting she has ever had) with her Drowned tour coming in at 2nd place. The Girlie show has is moments but the are parts that you want to skip (especially the horrendus version of Like a Virgin. What was she thinking?? it would have been been better is she hadnt performed it at all). The show tries to be shocking but it comes up short. The dancing is good and her band is as tight as ever. The stage set was rather weak. If you want the best show that she has ever done i suggest you wait for the release of The Blonde Ambition Tour.You wont regret waiting for it."
4,Madonna 1993 Tour,"Three years after the Blond Ambition tour came this one called ""The Girlie Show"", based mostly in her Erotica Album, this concert is more sexually charge than the former with naked girls, same-sex action and unappropiate rubbing, but if you are a Madonna fan you certainly can expect this.The concert was filmed in Australia and is a colorful spectacular event with complex dancing routines, attractives dancer and the number one live performance show girl/star Madonna.My favorite songs here were: Vogue ( a different version), Fever (very sexy), Express yourself/Deeper and Deeper (go go theme).If you are a Madonna Fan is a must have, if not you better like her Erotica album since this is the basic inspiration for the tour, but as always is a great pleasure seeing Madonna live."
2,"Dull, boring and disappointing concert","I consider myself highly appreciative of Madonna -- her singing, dancing, acting, her intelligence and innovation, etc. But this production featured only occasional memorable performances. Madonna does not look good in short, blond hair -- but she looks much worse doing performances in men's clothes, chiffon wigs and top hats! The choreography was not very special. The rendition of ""Like a Virgin"" was completely innovative -- and completely throw-away. As another reviewer stated, much of this video needed the fast-forward button. I cannot understand why so many people liked this production. I not only will never watch it a second time, I won't even keep it in my collection. Yes, ""Truth or Dare"" is MUCH better!"
5,MADONNA DOES IT BETTER..,"The virgin tour 1985 was just the begining, Who's that girl tour 1987 was a tease, The Blond ambition 1990 was a mega succesfull shocker,The Girlie Show 1993 proved Madonna wraps up things at what she does better than any other artist TOUR. I recorded this live on (vhs) the dvd is better, I love how they show the fans reactions on this concert than any other. Madonna gave it more here her voice was just at its best. 8 years later Madonna proved she still on top and more hard core than ever at the drowned world tour 2001. But I like girlie show way better.. buy it today"
3,Not one of her better concerts.,"The quality was not that great. There were some unusual dance scenes, but nothing spectacular. Just a so so experience. And it was brand new but looked like it had been repackaged."
1,Avoid like plague,A true turd from an otherwise talented artist. Stick to Paradise and Lunch or Chicken Skin Music by Ry Cooder.
5,NFL'S 100 GREATEST FOLLIES VHS.,"Great Collection of the National Football League's Greatest Follies, a little outdated now, but great collection of spills and falls and some other stuff. I am not A fan at laughing at other's misfortunes but I enjoy this video!"
1,At least I got 8 months out of it,"Bought this machine about 2 years ago. Made incredible stuff. Later that year it broke. The autoreverse mechanism kept reversing until the motor overheated and shut off. At that point I variously called and emailed about my problem. It obviously was never perceived as their problem. After about 6 months of calls, I finally got a replacement motor, which didn't work. I continued to attempt to get satisfaction, but never got any response. I don't trust these people who said that they would fix the problem. I asked to send the machine back and offered to pay freight. No response. I loved the gelato and sorbets I was making, but now I'm off the find a more reliable model. The freezer version by Cuisinart just doesn't stay cold enough for a big batch."
4,It's a different kind of country - don't underestimate it!,"This band is just totally under rated. Anyone that likes country with a bit of a bop style beat and something other than a cry in your beer style should try this album. Its just not your ""typical"" country, its rebel country with a fun attitude."
2,Upside is exciting,Employee Motivation is a FRAGILE art!How's that for insight.Include employees in the strategy development process!Another gem.This book makes for interesting reading at Starbucksbut is no where near corporate reality!In the down economy since 1999 employees have been abusedand taken for granted only to have more demands on themand less salary/bonuses/stock options available.The majority of salary adjustments DO NOT even keep up withthe cost of living.
5,Sweet!,"This is a really great book. It explains way more then you would expect for a field guide. It goes in depth about each plant, animals that depend on them and other interesting tidbits that you wont find in any other guide. The awsome illustrations are done so beautifully and true to life no one should have any problems idtentifying plants on the trail. They also truly give this book a nice touch. It's like a book of old documenting new discoveries!"
1,not happy at all!,"This is not an all regional dvd. my little girl was looking forward to it and now it doesnt play. i now have to somehow return it, which is a pain as i live in the UK."
5,RR-the Ultimate-Best Love,"As being part of the soul/funk movement of the 70's, Rose Royce will always be remembered for the Car Wash tunes. Personally, I think they never got the attention as they deserved, they will always have a special place for the real soul/funk lovers. Even these days, many remixes are based upon tunes from RR (wishing on a star/Is it love you're after). Any song by RR will have my 5 star reward. I just wonder where is the song ""Best Love"" one of my favorites which shows the classic souly sounds and the modern disco beats during those times (terrific drums and timing) which will go on to eternity. I'm still hoping on the release of their Best Love Album, well the tape will do for the time being."
5,this Disc is Slammin',"I Really Enjoyed this Collection.Rose Royce has been Very Influential.they are more than Car Wash.They Have done some of The Baddest Slow-Jams ever such as I'm Going Down,Love Don't Live Here Anymore,Wishing On A Star.This Band Deserves Mad Props."
2,Good introduction to a good 70s Semi-Disco and Soul singer.... All main hits included,"Rose Royce is mostly remembered for her Hit song for the movie Soundtrack ""Car Wash"", as well as for her main Hits ""I Wanna Be Next To You"" and ""Love Don't Live Here Anymore"". All three included here.The rest of this album is good only for 70s Soul and Near-To-Disco 'extreme' fans."
2,It's an OK CD,"I bought this CD for one particular song ""Wishing on a Star"". It's a pretty song. To me, the rest of the CD is not worth keeping in my collection."
1,There's a reason it's Out of Print,"Before reading this I knew absolutely nothing about Tennessee Williams....after reading it I wish I knew even less.Williams writes with no continuity, constantly jumping back and forth with stories from different times in his life, making this book difficult to follow.His drug addictions, prima donna temper tantrums, numerous homosexual trysts, and infidelity to his dying lover are nothing to be admired yet he writes about them as if they were badges of honor.Don't waste your money or time on this one."
4,Great Gossip,"Tennessee Williams ""Memoirs"" are a feast for people who love theater gossip. While the info may not be entirely reliable, it is fascinating. TW was never vague about his opinions of people or shows; who would have thought that Kenneth Tynan would have introduced him to Hemingway (they hit it off) and Hemingway led him to Fidel! Great fun and useful for the Williams Centennial Fest I'm leading in Albuquerque. (This book is hard to order from the publisher, but Amazon sent it promptly and in good shape.) pkb"
5,Memories of Westerns Past,"This is a great recording which contains at least five of TEF's best western songs.I've always love western music. My favorites are Marty Robbins, Frankie Laine, TEF, and Tex Ritter."
3,"If I were you, I would stick with the hymns","Essentially, what we have here is a CD of songs that typify a certain lifestyle of the rural south in the early twentieth century. (I did not want to be so rude as to say hicks.)While I am basically a part of the region, I am not in love with the music of the era. If you are, more power to you. I am probably overshooting my dislike for this general style of the music because I love to hear Ford's powerful, magnificent voice sing the many hymn standards that he recorded. As it is, though, I feel that this CD is inferior to what he was capable of recording and, quite frequently, did record with his version of many hymns."
4,"Basically a good book, but it could've been better...","SPHERE was a satisfying read. A delicious book. It could have been better. MC could have put so much more into it. Like, he could have made the sphere create some special alien, not just manifest the thoughts of those who entered it. ""THE POWER"" is kind of a stupid concept, but Crichton makes it what the book revolves around. He could have made more scenes in the ship, but overall this book was fairly good. Just not his best. If you want to read one of his that is very good READ THE LOST WORLD OR JURASSIC PARK, OR ANDROMEDA STRAIN!!"
5,"A FABULOUS book, from start to finish!! ;-)","I think that Sphere is THE BEST book written by MC ever, only next to Jurassic Park, of course. Some people say that the ending sucked but they are completely wrong."
5,Extremely greaa..t book!!!,"I think that 'Sphere' was one of the best books by MC, next to 'Jurassic Park'. The ending was not so good, so i gave it a 9 but otherwise this book is fabulous."
4,Suprisingly good,"This was one of the strangest books I have read (right up there with Stephen King), the type of book I usually don't care for. However, I rate books by the fact that once I start I'm hooked to the end. That was the case with this book. I couldn't put it down. The ending was a little disappointing. I felt it could have been more exciting. But all in all I really enjoyed this book."
5,Sphere is a great book,Sphere was a very good book. It was very suspensful and had a shocking end. I colnd'nt put the book down. I enjoyed reading it very much and I hope that you will to.
4,"A good read, very thrilling and suspenseful","I would have given the book a higher rating if not for the ending. I just wasn't happy about the ""We're not ready for this power so let's get rid of it"" way they left things, although I'm not convinced Beth really got rid of her powers. I was very impressed by how close the Movie stuck to the book, but the book explains things more clearly and there were a couple of major differences, i.e. the movie had Norman go into sphere right after Harry, whereas in the book Norman went in last. i would recommend Sphere to any Sci-Fi enthusiast."
2,It was really great until...,"I was enthralled by this book from the very beginning. Imagine, scientists discover an ancient spaceship at the bottom of the ocean only to discover it's true origin is a little closer to home.I have loved every Chrichton novel and this one was no different, at first. The story was tense, thrilling and the very last chapter killed the entire book for me. I won't give it away but the conclusion felt like a huge rip-off. I know I wasn't the only one who felt this way."
5,"two words ""the best""",this his best i've ever read. a compeling and thoughtfull look at our world and universe and it's many mysteries. I have plans to go back to the trenchs of the deep and the characters you learn to care about. This one I'll read plenty of times. A great read for anyone who enjoys great suspense and tons of mystery
5,"Gripping, Possibly his best work of fiction",Sphere is one of the best works of science fiction I haveever read. I could not put it down
4,"Great Book, untill the ending","This was an exciting book to read, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, great science fiction, however I do think that a more exciting ending could have put this book over the top. I almost seems that the ending was written in a hurry to get the book to print on time"
5,"""'SPHERE' made me read through the night!""","SPHERE by Michael Crichton was the best and most thrillingbook I have ever read. I was on vacation when I read it,and all I could do was read! I read until 3a.m. in a hotel,and I would have kept reading if my mom hadn't made me sleep.I thought it was even better than the ""BEST-SELLING"" JurassicPark, and better than those of any other author. If youreaders like to be kept on edge, eyes glued to every page,and only hearing and seeing the words come off the page andinto your imagination, read SPHERE by Michael Crichton."
4,Not his best work but not his worse either,"I read Sphere after getting hooked on Crichton's Jurassic Park and I must say it was a good book but didn't live up to some of his other works. It was an intriguing and quick read but I think there could have been a little more to it. I will say however it is infinately better then the movie Sphere which didn't have the depth of the book, even if it was more simplistic then some others. If you're just starting to read Crichton's books I wouldn't suggest starting here but if you're already a fan then I would suggest checking it out."
1,Utterly dire...stuff for 10 year olds.,"This book is the first Crichton I've read and will absolutely be the last. I would give this book to a third grader to read, and even then they'd probably hate me.The dialogue is so amazingly poor, so horribly childish, so laughably bad I went through it with a highlighter to pick out some of my favourite pieces of trash. This book is like an Ed Wood film, so bad it becomes funny. How, how, how did Crichton achieve anything as a writer? He can't write, he can't direct, what kind of remedial is he?"
3,Reading with Tequila,"Everything about Sphere was average. Its premise was interesting and it had the potential to be spectacular, but it failed to meet that potential. Without giving away too many keys details, all I can say is the thrilling surprise ending missed the mark. Decent alien science fiction, but nothing spectacular."
5,Sphere is one of the best science fiction novels written!,"This book is a must read!It all starts out when Norman Johnson, a psychologist, is asked to come to a crash site in the middle of the Pacific. When he arrives at the site, the Navy informs him that it wasn't a plane that crashed but a spacecraft. When Norman asks when the spacecraft had crashed (assuming within the last 30 years), he is told that it crashed nearly 300 years ago.What makes Sphere such a phenomenal novel is the unbelievable suspense. Sphere is one of those books that you cannot put down; there is not one dull part in this novel. Crichton writes so descriptively that the situation could be real. I found so many mysteries and questions in this book, and when they were resolved, the solutions blew my mind away.Sphere is filled with action, suspense, and mystery and fills my imagination even now. Anyone who reads this book will definitely enjoy it, and will keep wanting more."
1,Beware of what you wish for. Oops I wish the book had a plot,"I borrowed this from a co-worker. Sure glad I didn't waste my money on it. The basic story borrows ideas from all over. Time travel, alien monolith (the sphere), deep sea submarine setting, and it looks like a pop culture survey patched together. A plot that rambles around trying to get the reader interested and then a disappointing weak ending. I wish that I had taken a nap or read something else"
1,Rubbish!,"To call this science fiction is a masterpiece of understatement -- it is science nonsense. Besides utterly improbable characters, the ending is a total disappointment. I can't believe I stuck with it all the (ugh) way to the end."
4,you can't put it down,"The book was great. It was like it sucked you into it. Great for a normal Crichton reader and awesome for any reader. It is just different, and in a good way. A sci-fi thriller that you can't put done. It includes all the things about science that are interesting and gets you to think about them deeper. Great for all readers alike, and a must for a sci-fi freak."
4,Solid speculative fiction,"If you like technical fiction by Crichton like The Andromeda Strain then this is definitely one for you. It is one of his better page turners - only let down by the weak ending. What it does do well, apart from engage the reader, is it gets you to think of ideas and possibilities well beyond those raised in the novel itself (it certainly seems to have provided more than a little inspiration for James Cameron's The Abyss). Highly recommended."
3,I could ask for more,"This was written a long time ago. Black holes were on the cutting edge. I like Chrichton's scientific explanations. He could have written text books. This story is a good way to learn some science while reading a real page-turner. I would have liked to learn more about the vanished crew of the ship. Couldn't they have left videos? And the oceanic life forms that mysteriously appear and vanish. Have they been conjured up by someone's mind? My chief complaint is that Norman, the psychologist complains about all scientists, as though they go around inventing means of destruction. What about the pure scientists who are interested in how the world works and, generally, disinterested in what other people choose to do with their discoveries? Norman would have them sit around watching TV instead of doing science. Never mind that without ""science"" we wouldn't have TV. Again, this is a page turner and I recommend it."
2,OK But!,Not the best book written by Michael Crichton. The subject matter was interesting but the book it was too long and rambling. I did not get the satisfaction that I expect from this author.
3,A fairly pleasing diversion,"As a long-time science fiction buff, I've always been curious about this book. I've heard from friends over the years that as far as first-contact stories go, this one is right up there with 2001: A Space Odyssey. All due respect to Mr. Crichton, but I found this story far from achieving that sort of excellence. Of course the setting of Sphere doesn't lend itself to the same grandeur of scope found in Clark's work. This book is a good way to kill time.If you really want a first contact story that will knock your brains out, try Peter Watts' ""Blindsight""."
4,Attention grabber,This book will grab ones attention from the beginning and is very difficult to put down. The only thing keeping this book from being a five star book is that it somewhat lacks in character development. The storyline is excellent as each page makes one wonder what will happen next. Overall a very good and fun book to read.
5,Very good book,The book was very good. It had a lot of action in it and I liked it a lot. There was a lot of techinical stuff in it but it is real easy to understand if you like reading Crichton.
3,Better than the dumbest movie of the year...,"The movie was pathetic, I hope a swift recovery of the careers of all the fine actors lost in unplayable roles. The book was less stupid, but no less boring. You really have to worship Chrichton to get through it. It's one of his most techno-babble filled works, with precious little action. Still, he describes everything very well, especially the Jellyfish attack on Edmunds. Ending is less unimaginative than that of the movie, but still....come on. I recommend ""The Terminal Man"" or ""Jurassic Park"" instead. The movie may have lost more money than some people make in a lifetime, and it WAS based on this book. If you've seen the movie, read it so you can understand what was going on. Other than that, I see no real reason to torture yourself reading ""Sphere."""
5,"Best book I have ever read, it stays intense the whole time.","This book is unbeleivable, it keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to read more and more, I have read many books but this one is on the tope of my list, I would definately recommend it to anyone who wants to read a book that is interesting, and that has a great plot!"
5,One of the quickest books you will ever read!,"This book is gripping at the start! I think that the idea that Crichton proposes is one of emense proportions. I read the book in a day, and I am an extremely slow reader! Don't read the book in the dark or late at night because it can get a little creepy! This is my favorite book of all time!"
5,A great book to keep you reading!!!,Sphere is one of the best sci-fi books I have read! It is sweet when the monsters attack. This book takes place in an underwater habitat on the bottom of the ocean floor. Anyone can enjoy this book- I was 11 when I first read it! A fantastic thiller for everyone!
3,It's complicated but very exciting.,Sphere is very hard to comprehend and then it begans to take a wild turn in things that nobody would want to know about if any thing would happen. This book seems to be very confusing in the begining and then it finally we the people get the point he is trying to make.Don't read this book unless you want to take along time doing so. Have a good peachtree day.
3,Imaginative story with paranormal overtones,"M.C. demonstrates further (as if necessary!) the breadth of his imaginationin this story of undersea explorers who find more than they bargain for.Their discovery bends the very nature of reality. Perhaps unsatisfying tothe logician, the premise of the novel denies its own story. If this soundscryptic and contradictory, so be it."

5,SPHERE is the best book that Michael Crichton ever wrote!!!,"Sphere is great for you M.C. fans. It is a great combination ofhorror, mystery, and action. All from underwater wrekage to whole newlife species the action and suspence never stops.Michael constantly keeps you gessing whats going to happen next. Wait for a weekend to come along because once you pick up this great book you'll never put it down. Sphere is also soon to be a movie and I can't wait to see it on the big screen. Just imagine..... uncontrollable power....."
5,UTTERLY FANTASTIC ! ! !,"I couldn't put this one down. This book wastes no time, immediately drawing you into this fantastically unique and imaginative story. It pulls you in and doesn't let go until the last page. I read it all in one night! Oh, yeah, go see the movie if you read the book and like it. If you like the book, you'll like the movie."
3,Good,"I usually don't read Michael Crichton, but I saw this book on the bestseller shelf and, wanting a good read that would while away my New Year's holiday, picked it up. I can definitely see how much better this story will be as a movie, as the characters seem to cry out for an actor's interpretation to make me want to care about them. I was disappointed by how all the technobabble was wasted in favor of direct action. Still, the suspense is worthwhile and I feel I had paid a good price for the time I spent reading the book."
4,Really good book....will make even better movie!!!,"While this was a really good book, I think it will make an even better movie. There are very few movies that are better than the books, but I think this will be an exception. The ending is astounding, and I can just see Samuel L.Jackson as Harry, and Sharon Stone as Beth, and Dustin Hoffman as Norman. Even Caroline Goodall and Rip Torn (Barnes of course.) Anyone agree..or have any suggestions for the movie?"
1,"Interesting premise, thrilling story, really LAME ending","The ending of this book was so weak and unimaginative that it ruined the entire novel. It is as if Michael Crichton worte a great story and slapped the ending together as an afterthought. It has to be one of the worst books I have read and it all has to do with the ""Let's pretend nothing happened and it will all go away"" ending. After reading the novel I have lost all respect for Michael Crichton as an author. All his stories seem to have ""zero-impact"" endings. After all is said and done the worlds in which his novels take place are no different on the last page as they were on page one. This includes Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain, that lame movie Demi Moore was in, and Sphere."
1,WHAT WAS WITH THE ENDING??!!!???!?!!!!!!??????,"It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends? I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something."
2,This book has a special place in my heart,"This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading. I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book. But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end. That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel. This is ""deus ex machina"" in its finest form. This is unexcusable in my opinion. I just don't get it. I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages. I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book. This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever."
4,Very good and very graphic.,"Like I said with Prey and Jurassic Park this book is very good, but also very graphic. If they do a remake of the Sphere movie (which currently garners a 12% ""rotten"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes) then I hope it is as good as this book (hopefully it won't be rated R or X or NC-17 or something.) :]"
3,"Crichton is OK, but not great",This particular Crichton did have its moments. Worth a read if not already done. But it also seemed to be lacking. Enjoy it but don't expect too much.
4,"Good plot, more action, a little confusing.",One of Crichton's best! Indeed worth making a movie about! You should enjoy this wonderful book!
5,"gripping, perplexing, and imaginative, sheer genius!","After reading this book, you will be more conscious of yourself, your surroundings, and how precious your life is. You might even understand the role of humans on earth, what makes us different... Just when you think the characters can't get into any more trouble, Crichton takes their desperate situation and smashes it to pieces. It is amazing. Sometimes it gets a bit on the technical side, so if you don't like to read about a lot of scientific information, this book might bore you a bit, yet for those who are interested in the sciences, Crichton manages to take the most advanced perplexing concepts and explain them to the reader with extremely suave. The ending is superb, and I must advise any one who likes science to pick it up today!"
4,This is a really good book.,"This book is from the movie ""Sphere"" and is written by Michael Crichton. In my point of view, I recommend that you read the book THEN watch the movie because I think that the book is better than the movie. The book comes more to the details than the movie itself. The book and the movie are not the same. Some of the parts in the book are different than that of the movie."
2,Not very good,"A fan of Crichton's previous books, I didn't like this one very much. It was very predictable. The annoyance of some of the characters i.e. Harry, Ted and Beth really got to me after a while. I was wishing that Beth and Harry would die so that they could shut up. I guess I was wrong. Thank God Ted the most annoying character was killed. But come on a squid attacking the habitat?? It's trite and boring. Also the ending 'Let's just forget about everything and everything will be ok!' What a joke, it only shows society's mentality of thinking that they can solve their problems by magic. The only good thing about this book is that some of the discussions between the characters gives a lot of insight on human nature."
3,"I usually like Crichton, but not this one","Starts interesting, but progressively loses strength. Terrible ending"
2,Crichton's worst.,"A three-hundred-year-old-spaceship at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Sounds interesting enough, right? Well, listen to this. The 'life form' controlling the Sphere inside the spaceship is nothing more than a scientist's 'manifestation' as Crichton calls it. The Sphere is a supposed liason between imagination and reality, creating whatever the person inside it imagines. I give Michael Crichton great credit as an author. (I've read seven of his books.) But he was obviously hurting for a plot when he wrote, (or perhaps 'manifested') Sphere. The story does not flow along smoothly, and the end is big disappointment. If you love Michael Crichton's works, but you haven't read Sphere, I advise you not to. The ending, which wraps up in the final ten pages, is a waste of the other 350 pages."
3,"OH! THIS IS INTERESTING,BUT, OH! THE ENDING,OH NO!","What else can i say about this fine story about two central points, extraterrestrial contact and psychology or maybe psycho first?. I don't know but i must say that the ending was so simple that don't deserve any more comments."
4,"Great premise, bad ending!","I read this book a couple years ago and thought it had a goodstory until the ending. Being so creative, Mr. Crichton could havemade the ending more believable and plausable."
5,THIS IS THE BEST!!! MICHAEL CRICHTON RULES!!!,THIS IS ONE OF MC'S BEST PIECE OF WORK. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOKTO ANYONE. READ IT!
5,Haven't read it yet??? What are you waiting for?,"One of Crichton's masterpieaces... After I've read this book, Iread almost all Crichton's books! Crichton is a great writer, whoknows tp keep you tensed 'till the end of the novell. I recommend this book for any SCIFI fan, who likes the scintific style."
2,There's better sci-fi around,"I found Sphere to be pleasantly diverting for a few days, but I guess I'm spoiled by reading novels of late that are actual ""literature"". Crichton's writing here just doesn't make the cut. His characters are cardboard (even though he tries to give some a PC twist, like the black mathematician), his prose is utilitarian, terse and vocabulary limited (e.g., he used the word ""uneasy"" twice in two pages to describe one character who was lying and one who had a stomach ache), and much of his ""science"" is hokey (I say that as a scientist). On the plus side, he does know how to concoct a clever, suspenseful story and reel out just enough of it at a time to keep you turning the pages. My advice if you like sci-fi adventure: your time is better spent reading real writers like Asimov, Verne, Wells, Bradbury, Heinlein and many others."
1,"Good tech writing, interesting plot, but boring","The technology represented in this story is facsinating. The plot is interesting. The story, though just ain't neither. This book's major flaw is that it lacked oomph to pull the reader through to the end. I finished reading it because I felt I owed it to the seven bucks or so that I spent on it. So if you're familiar with his other books, you will be disappointed by this one."
4,"A good book, but not Crichton's best.","Sphere was a good book with interesting concepts, but I have to say it was not one of Crichton's best. I'm looking forward to the movie version to see how similar they are. I got the feeling that this book was written specifically to be made into a movie, that's why it seems to be missing something."
5,"AWESOME!! HIS BEST!! READ NOW!! ""Brian Gaughan""","Toataly awesome his best to date. Some people may say the ending makes them loose respect for Crichton its not true. HELLO they need to ask themselves what would the ending be like if they wrote it and they were at the part Where Harry, Beth, and Norman are in the decompresion chamber thinkin what to say to everyone. I still have full respect for Crichton. Dont listen to those other coments. READ IT THE FIRST CHANCE YOU GET!!!!!"
3,WHAT ABOUT THE SHIP??!!,"Well, after reading JP I though I was in for another treat... I got the book and when I started reading it had the fast paced story I expected from MC. One of my favorite parts of the book delt with the underwater space ship. It was the most interesting part of the book in my opinion, but was the least explained part of the book. I didnt really get into the characters much, not very personal people. The character Jerry did get my attention, I enjoyed his puzzles and his slow suspensful way of talking to the eager scientists... Like most others I found the ending very BAD but I did read it about three times so I give it some credit.I would have liked it much more if the shp had been explored more!"
4,"exciting, imaginative!","I finished this book during a 13-hour flight from Chicaga to Tokyo. Frankly, this book didn't impress me very much at the beginning, but halfway through, I was hooked! The first part is a little boring, but from second part, it slowly builds up tension, and reaches climax and I was very impressed by Mr.Crichton's thorough knowledge of zoology and astronomy, and the descriptions of the fictional spaceship is plausible and imaginative.Unlike many others, I like the ending of the book. I think this book would have been a mediocre sci-fi novel if Mr.Crichton had conceived some alien creature in the sphere."
5,My favorite book,Once I started reading this book I didn't stop till I finished. Compared to the book the movie was kind of a disappointment.
5,He's the man,He's done it again. If you haven't read any of his stuff this will get you started. His writing style is unparalleled and wildly unpredictable. If you like books that consume you from beginning to end this is the book for you. Once you start you will be a Chrichton JUNKY.
3,A Good Way To Spend Friday Evening,In this book Mr. Crichton has us believe that the Earth has been visited by a Space craft from the future of the United States. I for one find it hard to believe that we could find a way to send something that big back three hundred ( 300 ) years to ourselvs without any type of operating manuel to tell us how to get it started.Also I find that this book was a good way to spend reading on a Friday evening after I came home from work and finished my homework
3,A brilliant idea with a dissapointing ending.,"The set-up is great! A space ship found at the bottom of the ocean that's been there for at least 300 years. But a variety of mysteries are just not dealt with and the ending leaves you with a ""well, what the hell is that thing"" looming."
2,"a few truly fascinating parts, disappointedly weak ending","This book captured my imagination and I think it did the same for most people who read. It posed some intriguing questions about the power of the human brain, something which the human race has been fascinated with from time immemorial but which we still know very little about. The time travel aspect of the book was also interesting, albeit somewhat cliched. All in all, a great novel, its only weakness being a mundane, anti-climactic ending which stands in blatant contradiction with the rest of the plot. --DB"
3,Gripping Suspense with a Jellyfish Finish,"Typical Crichton, this novel spins a suspenseful web around technology with a typically reluctant, but plucky, lead character in Norman. The suspense was real and gripping throughout the book. I read each page with anticipation, expecting (and getting) a new plot twist at every turn.Why three stars? The ending drifted predictably to a Dallas-esque, never-mind-it-was-only-a-dream conclusion. The ending was so lame that I really felt let down. In the end, it was a five star book with a one star ending. I still recommend the book for the roller coaster ride it is. Just quit while you're ahead with about ten pages to go."
2,Over all this was not a good book,"I enjoy reading Mr. Crichton's work. He is an excellent story teller, but this book seemed rushed. He started off with a really good idea: Space ship from the future (American) found enbedding in a reef at the bottom of the ocean. No one was inside except for this sphere. Where did it come from? What does it do? Did it kill the crew? Where did the ship come from? Etc Very intriguing! Then it stopped. The concept concerning what the Sphere could do and how they fought against it was lame. It read as if Mr. Crichton had to hurry up and beat a deadline so he just wrote it and finished."
2,For some reason I hated this one.,I'm giving the book a 3 simply because it was good Crichton.Till the ending that is. It was the absolutely mostdisappointing ending to any book I think I've ever read.Other people I've talked to think this is one of the besthe's ever written. I guess you'll have to read it yourself.
1,amateur night at the sphere,"Too long. Childish ending. The characters, all experts in their field, behaved like amateurs making the story unbelievably frustrating and boringly silly. What a disappointment Try The Andromeda Strain & The Terminal Man instead."
2,Just okay,"I loved the idea, that's why I bought the book. However, reading the book was just good in the fact it passed some time. I thought the movie was of the same quality."
5,Wonderful wonderful book!,"Disregard the movie, it does no justice to this book. When I found it on my father's bookshelf as a 13 or 14 year old I was amazed. I read and reread and reread it, over and over again. Impossible to to tear myself away from it...almost an obsession. My father's copy finally split at the bindings, and I had to buy a second. Trust me, this book is one definately worth the $."
1,"If this is his best, I'd hate to read his worst!","It started out slow, but I kept reading. I've never read Crichton before and I don't think I will ever read him again. The only part that I thought made it enjoyable was ""it ended."""
5,Easily one of the best novels ever written,"Michael Chrichton proves that he is the best author on the planet with Sphere. It is fun to read and very educational. It causes a feeling of paranoia and claustrophobia as Norman, Beth, and Harry are trapped underwater and not knowing who to trust. Great plot, great charecters, and I think I am the only person alive who actually was satisfied with the ending."
5,Great book! Crichton at his best!,"I have read most all Crichton's works, and let me tell you, this one tops them all. It is everything Andromeda Strain and Jurrasic Park were, and more! I have never seen the movie Sphere and only have half a desire to, but there is no way it can ever best this book. In my opinion, this is one of the best books of the 20th century."
2,"Crichton was not quite ""on"" this outing","This book is fast-paced and well written, especially the first half, but the plot is not as well constructed as some of his others. The problem is that subsequent events render earlier events illogical and senseless. The book starts out well but reaches a very disappointing resolution, as if Crichton bit off more than he could chew. The fact that this book was made into a movie demonstrates, yet again, that Hollywood will go with a project of dubious merit if it is attached to the name of a proven winner."
4,Worth borrowing on a rainy day.,The basis of the story is an excellent piece of imagination but the delivery and ending hint of a rush job.
4,An Amazing Book,"Sphere is a masterpiece of techo-fiction, an awe-inspiring story of a mysterious 300 year old ship found at the bottom of the sea and of the scientists who investigate it. Complex and well-written, the ending is exactly what you need, but not neccesarily what you expect. Top-notch fiction from a master in the field."
1,I was sorely dissapointed.,"I'm not sure which was worse, the movie or the book, but either way, the book was a huge dissapointment. He builds us up to some climax, but in the end, it was a very dissapointing resolution. Almost as if the publishers said ""Hey, Mikey, we need that book NOW, so FINISH IT. None of the themes were new, but I will say he DID manage to engage me for a while, which perhaps is why I felt so let down at the end."
3,Huge Crichton Fan!,"Unfortunately, this is one of the few times where the movie outshined the book. I love Crichton's novels, but we all know the books are better than the movies. This movie outdid the book though. If I were you, I would spend the couple dollars and buy this one on video. I hope I saved you money!Enjoy the video!"
3,oh the agony of the ending!,"OK, I am an admitted hater of Crichton's work. However, Sphere was entertaining and had me guessing until a forth of the way through (I've never seen the movie, or heard anything about the book). However, any fond feelings that I may have felt for this book was completely decimated by the cop-out ending!The slow drag partway through the story not withstanding, the pacing is good, and mood that Crichton cast is both eerie and suspenseful. I would have given this book a high rating, just because I was so surprised how much I enjoyed the ending...until the last five pages. Actually, if you skip the last five pages of the book - you will love the book and will walk way enjoying this much more then you would otherwise.I'm dying to say more, but I can't without giving away the ending, and while the ending isn't worth the paper it was printed on (was Crichton just bored of the book, by this point?!?), I don't want to ruin it for people who dislike spoilers."
2,I'm sorry but,"I'm sorry but that was one of Michael Crichton's worst books. The beginning had me hooked but the end was just stupid. I am also in the making of a book report on this book for English and i'm supposed to pretend i'm selling it but i wouldn't even try to if it wasn't for getting a good grade. The characters weren't very complex and kinda dumb. Norman sounded tired and an idiot the whole time. Beth was insane. Harry was just not there, he was supposed to be rude, smart, and sarcastic all the time but he was not. The ship was pretty cool but they thought the sphere was more important, which it was the point of the story but it was pretty boring. The Sphere really doesn't do anything, its all in Norman, Harry, and Beth's imagination that ends up coming true b/c the sphere shows them that part or power of their imagination to make things real.Oh well maybe its just me who didn't like it."
3,Great concept. Poor follow through,"Michael Crichton is not a great writer. His prose style is rather stiff, as are most of his characters. His real strength is in hitting on great story ideas. His main failing is in not following through successfully. This book is a good example. The initial premise - a group of scientests being assembled to investigate a spherical space ship on the bottom of the ocean - offers great promise, and the initial incidents in the story are interesting, but from the first third of the book it is all downhill. Much of the plot is silly and the ending is totally unsatisfying.So if you are a die hard Crichton fan, no problem. Anyone else should expect to be disappointed."
5,This book is an exiting sci-fi thriller for all readers,"This book has everything needed to make agreat sci-fi thriller, suspece will drive crazy to find out what is going on. However, this book has so many twists and turns in the plot you will go crazy until you get to the end, but this still doesn't change the fact that this book is written in great way and is very interesting, you wont be able to put the book down. Another plus to this book are the scientific fact that are in the book that can help you learn a lot of information you never knew, like in all the other Michael Crichton books.Since this book is soon to be major motion picture I advise you to read the book before the you see the movie. This book is made for everyone who loves sci-fi and action books. This book will keep you readoing until you finish, I finished the book in 3 days and I enjoyed it very much."
5,Spectacular!!!,"A team of scientists are shipped down to what the navy thinks,is an alien spacecraft, what they find is beyond their wildestimaginations, they find the Sphere...A very powerful but also mortally dangerous item! Sphere adds a mix between science fiction and science in a breath-holding way, I read the sphere and I finished it the same day, you just can't stop reading! Great book!"
4,"A page turner,couldn't put it down.",It kept me guessing and in the end had some good human insights that I wasn't expecting. Interesting deep sea knowledge shared too.
3,A bit of a letdown,"For the most part, I enjoyed reading the book, but I really felt like the climax was a real let-down. Pieces of the story just didn't fit together well. I preferred A Case of Need, which is not sci-fi and Timeline, which held together better."
2,Maybe the Movie will be better,"Crighton misses an opportunity to add to the lore about first contact with aliens, through his flat, uninteresting characters. His initial premise about a possible alien ship sitting at the bottom of the ocean is exciting and the twist about it turning out to be a human ship from the future is great. Furthermore, his genius for plot is demonstrated by having the actual alien artifact the Sphere inside the ship.However, his characters were boring. I was hoping they would die. I liked how the Sphere effected them, but I could careless about the people. Hopefully, when this is made into a movie, the actors will be able to make more out of the characters than I did."
4,"Great book, if you can think","This book was excellent, suspenseful all the way through.One of his more exciting works. I couldn't put it down forthe last fifty pages. The action lags a bit at the end, butthe suspense is still there, and anyone who says it suckedjust didn't understand its implications."
3,Fast-paced thriller about an object of unknown origin.,"A mysterious object is discovered on the ocean floor, and with the help of the Navy, a team of scientists are sent to investigate. Crichton manages to fuse the apprehension of the unknown with the fear of things we don't wish to know about ourselves. The mental claustrophobia builds rapidly in this fast-paced thriller"
3,"Interesting Plot, Lame Ending","I was looking for a quick read at my local library and picked Sphere up by accident. As a big Robin Cook fan, I immediately dove into this book. I never saw the movie, so I have a pretty un-biased opinion of the book.The ideas behind Sphere were creative, but I found myself rolling my eyes at several totally unbelievable parts of the novel (and I'm a big sci-fi lover!). The dialogue between characters was also a bit forced, but I'd recommend this book if you're looking for something to read by the pool :)"
5,The Book was AWSOME!,Sphere was a very very good I loved it. Crichton described with exelance. It was like he was drawing in my mine ilustrations while I was reading. I learned a lot about the ocean while reading this great book. It was very suspenceful and a major cliff hanger. I would strongly recomend this once in a life time novel.
5,I read this book twice and I think it was just plain GREAT.,"I loved this book for many reasons. First it was a very suspenceful and scary book. I like that. It had many exiting plot twists and freaky elements. When I was reading it i figured it would mostly focus on the suspected alien ship ( they weren't sure what it was till the middle ). SUPRISE! To my suprise, it actually took place mostly in the habitat. This book is a great, great book for everybody. If you don't like Crichton, who cares?! You have to read this book. It's worth every cent. It's non-stop exitement and I reccomend it to EVERYONE. READ THIS BOOK!!!"
5,One of the best novels ever written,"Try to take Richard Bach and his 'Illusions' and make his characters so well defined that you'd think they're real, existing people, and you'll have 'Sphere'. It's one of the best books I ever read. It makes you think you mean something in this world and life is worth living. It makes you proud to be a human being. And that's, I'd say, enough to take it in your hands."
5,SPHERE,TO ME THIS BOOK IS A VERY GOOD BOOK BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF GREAT ACTION PARTS IN IT.I ALSO LIKE IT BECAUSE IT HAS PARTS ABOUT HOW THEY CAN GET POWERS FROM THE SPHERE.POWERS TO MAKE THINGS.I THINK THAT WAS REAL COOL.I WOULD LIKE TO GET POWERS TO MAKE THINGS.IT WAS ALSO A GOOD BOOK BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT.THE BOOK MAKES YOU READ IT MORE AND WONDER MORE ABOUT IT.I HOPE PEOPLE OUT THERE GET TO READ THIS BOOK
4,Great Book,"This is one of the few books I have actually read in only one day. It keeps you interested, and will make you not want to put it down. The only thing I disliked was the ending."
4,very cool,"i really liked this book. it shows the downside of human nature and how we act when given a ""power."" the ending leaves you questioning, and makes you like ""what would i have done in that situation?"" although not his best, it is good. whatever you do, dont watch the movie. the movie is crap."
5,Don't see the movie,"Sphere is indescribable. I just finished the book and I appreciate Crichton's advanced, creative and imaginative thinking. However, unlike Timeline, the ending left me wanting an answer. Being a writer myself, I always know the part that a writer just assumes the reader will discover after some thought. Yet, the novel seems to want to stay ambiguious; you're mind is always searching for a concrete answer. Crichton refuses to give you one.Sphere transcends a ""sci-fi thriller"" that ""keeps you in suspense"". It, unlike most else, makes you think. It also confuses the hell out of you, but (to quote my favorite Gladiator) ""Are you not entertained?"" People forget that Crichton isn't writing to answer long asked theological questions; he's writing to make you think and to entertain. After all those vanishing pages, I would answer a definitive yes."
5,CRICHTON'S BEST!!!,"A novel fraught with suspense, action, and mystery. I loved it!!!The ending makes you want more"
2,"Good story, but.....","This was a good story, but it was getting long towards the middle. I wouldn't say it was predictable, but it was taking too long between incidents. I rarely felt like I had to keep reading... Several times I just wished it would end. I am an avid reader, so it takes a lot for me to not complete a book. This one was close.Oh well.... I still think Crichton is one of the best!"
5,Non-Stop Reading!!!!,"I bought this book because of the title and the description it had. First I started reading it with no enthusiasm and read to page 20 aprox., another day I read a bit more because the book was getting more interesting with every page (I read to page 70 aprox.), then a third day I read to page 250 aprox. and ended reading that day because it was two hours past midnight. Then a fourth day I finished the whole book (371 pages). My conclusion is that the book will rise your hair and make you continue reading no matter the hour or how tired you are."
5,Incredible Work Of Art - A Speed Of Light Page Turner,"This was my third Crichton book that I've read and was honestly sitting on the shelf for a rainy day. Last week, I picked up Sphere and within a fraction of my normal reading time for a 300-400 page book, I was finished with Sphere and hoping for more!Michael Crichton leads you through the story without any break-points or useless information. He manages to make items like the Time/Space Continuim, Black Holes, Paradoxes and other intense scientific items easy to comprehend. Up until the last few pages, one did not know how the book would be resolved. Excellent writing! I highly recommend reading Sphere, especially if you have not seen the so-so movie version."
1,"A good book, but the ending totally sucked","An adventerous underwater excursion, complete with alien space craftand time travel, does not make up for the ending.You will surely be dissapointed."
1,Pulp at its worst,"Crichton writes ""blockbuster"" novels which handily translate to ""blockbuster"" movies. Lowest-common-denominator action pulp at its worst. It's not even good science fiction, which genre has a noted tendency to forgive some of the traditional demands of literature (character, style, plot) if the imaginative vistas are nice enough. But this one? Naw, baby, naw. I can't tell you how many times I've groaned in pain when I mention to someone that I read a lot of science fiction; three out of five immediately ask, ""Oh, do you like Michael Crichton?"" In a word, no.On the other hand, if you need something for a transatlantic flight, you might find this in the airport. As brain candy, it serves its purpose. Leave it in the john for the next guy."
5,The best book about a Sphere of the 20th Century,"Wow, what to say about this book. Well I forget. If you haven't yet read Sphere ignore that last statement. Sphere has everything you would expect from a book with such a title. It has a great sci-fi story that keeps you guessing and guessing, and I don't mean why am I reading this damn book guessing either. Sphere is such an excellent book that I would say without hesitation that Jay should read this book... right now. Hey I said right now. The Pepsi joke just killed me. Now thats great writing, but its the end of Sphere that is so forgetable. As a matter of fact this book is as forgetable as Jays mom, but hey that's just me. So if you are reading this review and just not sure if you should read this, than just stop reading now and buy this book. BUY THIS BOOK! Well there you go you gotta admit it, on a scale of one to ten, I give this book an A... Of course"
3,Sphere,"Sphere by Michael CrichtonIt was good, but seemed a little predictable after reading other Crichton books.I will read others however."
5,Fantastic. Sheer Brilliance from Crichton.,"What can I say-this book overwhelmed me. I read it in a day and night. Maybe one of the most suspenseful, provocotive sci-fi-psychological books of all time. Impossible to put down. If you are a Crichton fan, YOU MUST read this. Better by far than Jurassic Park of The Lost World. The details and even the very essence of Crichton's writing are overwhelming. I have read 11 of his books, and this one is undoubtedly the best."
5,"HORROR, FRIGHT, & A SOLID FEARFUL SHOCKER","'SPHERE' is a horrorfying nightmare about a huge craft discovered resting on the bottem of the ocean. A group of scientists investigate the area immediately. They enter the craft with caution, and unleash a sleeping bloodbath, ready to come their way. Very engrossing. Boo ha ha ha!"
2,Not so good...,"The only redeeming quality I was able to find in this book was the attention to detail that Crichton paid in compiling scientific information for this poor excuse for a novel. Aside from that, the characters were two-dimensional cardboard cutouts, which prevented me from having any sort of empathy with them at all. At the end of this novel, the biggest mystery I found was how I was able to finish this mediocre piece of garbage."
5,Another Amazing Adventure!,"This book begins when Norman, A psychologist, is called by the Navy for a very special project. So special, that the Navy doesn't tell Norman and a group of scientists what they think is really going on. The special group is sent underwater to spend a few days investigating a space craft. There the group finds a beautiful sphere.They are all dumbfounded about why the mysterious sphere is there. It doesn't seem to do anything.....At first. Crichton, once again writes another thrilling novel. ""Sphere"" keeps your attention, and makes you believe you are a part of it's world.With never a dull moment, you will absoutely love ""Sphere."""
4,Good technical details+ok storyline,"This story has excellent technical details. The psychology tests information was great while the explanations on quantum theory were just brilliant. The effects of mind-control, how man has little control over his mind is also there. The plot is ok. After an interesting start, it peters out along the line. If you like sci-fi, psychology and techno-thrillers, go ahead and read it."
5,The Closest He's Come To Old-School Science Fiction,"Since I thought I had been giving too many five-star reviews lately, I was somewhat determined to give Sphere four stars. However, I realized it would be an injustice to this great book.Sphere is the closest Michael Crichton has come to old-school science fiction. It is in the grand tradition of Arthur C. Clarke and his contemporaries: suspense, the not-quite-knowable yet seemingly real object, etc. This also has the best characters in all of Crichton's body of work and is complete with a semi-cliffhanger ending -- though you may not realize it."
5,My favorite book,This is truely one of the best books i ever read. I found myself getting up in the middle of the night to read it. It is well written and discriptive. A real page turner-read it if you havent you will love it.
5,I could picture it so easily.,This book is the best written book I have ever read. I can still se all the details of the book and I read it almost a year ago. I don't remember how much I enjoyed the story but the author created a wonderful picture and I could imagine everything. I think I liked it a lot because I read it for 15 hours striaght. I recomend it highly and you should look forward to reading it.
3,"Good read, but...","I'm definitely in the minority here. While I love Michael Crichton's books, this was my least favorite.A team of experts from various fields are pulled together and assembled to investigate what appears to be an alien spacecraft on the bottom of the ocean. The plot thickens as several crew members mysteriously die, one at a time, before those who are left figure out that they are responsible. It is a suspenseful and riveting read.I just felt that sometimes it is a little too cerebral and far fetched, at the same time."
5,What a book!,"I had read some more recent books by Michael Crichton. This one is very different. It is way more science fiction. It kept me reading way into the night. Just the setting of the book will draw you in... a habitat so far under water that the light from the sun does not reach. The lights on the habitat can only show a small distance and beyond that light is unknown... If you are a fan of sci-fi at all, read this book."
3,"Similar to the classic movie ""Forbidden Planet""",I was disapointed because I found the main element of the plot similar to the premise of the movie Forbidden Planet.
4,"Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the vainest of them all?","This mixture of science fiction and horror is really a psychodrama, set 1000 feet below the ocean surface. A team of intrepid scientists is assembled by the US Navy to explore an alien spaceship found in the Pacific. Although we don't entirely solve the riddle about where the ship came from, we do find an incredible sphere inside it, which changes the lives of the scientists. Who can you trust? What is real and what is only imagined? What is reality? These are all questions thrust at our protagonist, an overweight psychologist struggling to keep pace with the other intellectual giants. This book should be made into a movie - not the one with Dustin Hoffman and Sharon Stone - but one faithful to the text. It keeps the reader's attention. Michael Crichton deserves kudos for doing his homework on it, as well. His scientific descriptions are believable, for the most part."
1,Ho-hum,"Seems to me it's kids who like this book so much. I can't imangine anyone with brains who think MC is go great anymore. These days he writes with the big screen in mind. I remember reading ""The A--- Strain"" centuries ago and it was really D--- good. Someone mentioned ""The Great Train Robbery"" which is very good because it's based on a true (note:TRUE)story so MC can't stick any lizard aliens in it. (Why are all aliens lizard-like anyway? What ever happened to semi-human types). Will I watch this move? No way, with a dopey cast like that. Did I read the book? I don't have to, I have telepathy."
2,Worst book ever,"This is the worst Crichton book I've ever read. The characters seem to become hollow in the middle of the plot, which is like a bad chapter of the X-files."
1,The worst Crichton ever,"Just not a good book for Mike. The hardest read I've had of his. Even worse than ""The Lost World"" in bad story line. At least that one was fun even though it was so obviously a sequel designed just to make money."
3,I'll give one half a star with that.,"It's a interesting, twist of a tale. The movie was not half the book....The book has alot more to more understand what is going on, and alot more dialoge that you'd remember. I personally liked the movie, after watching the movie, I thought nothing of the book. Then not to long ago I came across the biook and decided to read it. Well it's not as fast paced as it say's it is. But that's okay, it's a mind twister, and it get's you to think, like when the *THING* starts to speak on the computer screens in a series of numbers as communication, you get the urge to figure it out yourself, (well I did). All I can say it's a twisted tale, and is worth a short read, if you have seen the movie then it's a must."
3,A Disappointing Crichton,"The first 3/4 of this book is great. Crichton sets up an excellent plot. The last 1/4 of the book is crap. He goes nowhere with the great plot. The reader never really finds out what the Sphere is! Come on Mike, you can do better than this!"
2,Undeveloped Ideas,"Sphere, like many of Crichton's novels, starts off with good intentions. But, unfortunately, it is like walking into a coffee shop with wonderful aromas only to have the promise of the aromas result in ordinary and somewhat dissapointing taste. He could have gone much further with this novel but seems, instead, to only want to play to the superficiality of the masses. His books seem somewhat formulaistic and predictable and he sometimes mistakes a confusing plot for great intellectual insight. But, what the heck, if someone makes it into a movie, it is going to be a best seller regardless of the quality of writing. That is an indictment not of Mr. Crichton but of the general public. Perhaps it is us who is wrong and it is Mr. Crichton who is correct by playing to an audience he knows well. By the way, if you thought the novel was bad, rest assured, the movie was even worse."
2,Like a croissant - crummy and flaky,"Michael Crichton is one of the most uneven authors around. Here he is at his most uneven. The storyline of Sphere starts out very well and then just.... fizzles out. The ending is extremely weak, almost annoying, and the book feels somewhat wasted."
4,Be puzzled and enjoy the feeling!,"Suspensful science fiction that keeps the reader guessing at every turn. A crew sent to study a mysterious spacecraft found at the bottom of an ocean. The story got on a rather slow start, I felt, but it is actually the author's way of building up suspense, as the crew (as well as the reader ) is baffled at every event; from guessing what their mission is all about, to the entry into the spacecraft, to the discovery of the sphere, to the speculation of whether they are communicating with an alien or somebody from the future. The pace accelerated and the urge to solve the mystery kept me turning the pages. So would you if you are a science fiction buff. i would like to add that initially I was skeptical about the inclusion of a psychlogist as part of the crew, but author left no loose ends unexplained, as he showed that 'soft' science is just as important as 'hard' science when mankind is fighting against the unknown."
5,"Gripping, action-packed, yet enigmatic","Sphere can not be completely explained verbally. It must be read, and even then it will not be fully explained. Michael Crichton writes a brilliant novel. Read it when you have spare time, because you will not want to put it down"
1,Do not buy this item.,"After returning the secong one, I will never use this brand again. The first one leaked water, and the second one just wouldn't wotk period. Save yourself the time and effort and buy another brand!!!"
4,Covers the Topic Well,This book is a very good guide to recycling old items and creating new uses for them. Environmentalists everywhere will certainly appreciate the reuse of older items. The book is illustrated very well and the photographs are nicely done.
2,Almost,"This book is a little cheezy... it is close, but it is almost like they made up a few projects just to fill the book... it is OK, but not yet there...they are getting close... a little too chatskee..."
3,So so,"Cute but don't expect to get any deep advice from this video. If you can get it cheap or need a Couple's ""Pick me up"" then get it."
4,VERY DIFFICULT TO SUM UP,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This starts slowly. In fact, at about 120 pages I still wasn't sure I was even enjoying what I was reading. (This is partly affected by the blurb inside the front cover which gives away some plot points, so you are waiting for them to happen as you are reading.) But then, I got sucked in. The book is nothing but the typed thoughts of the main character, but as he gets older, you know more and more about him and his family, and he became a friend I felt I was listening to. The plot of the book could probably be summed up in 5 sentences, so don't read it for plot. Read it if you find you like the author's voice. I found myself genuinely sad at the end of the book."
5,MAGNIFICENT WRITING FROM START TO FINISH,"I agree with the other reviews except I thought it was totally involving throughout. As my days went by there was always a background of Tom Ripple that drew me to continued reading. Hard to shake off his philosophy and world view.Also, I dont find anyone talking about the humor which starts on page one. True, he does evolve, but his basic goodness and acceptance of life is apparent from the start. The punning is clever and often hilarious; particularly the reactions of the other characters to his broad based humor. I loved it when he interacts with Fogarty whom he recognizes as his match. There are so many gems to savor.I would like to read his unpublished novels.This is a must read book."
4,It's all read now,"This is decidedly not a book you can't put down. It's more a book you keep putting down and returning to later. Written as a fictional memoir, it is comprised of a large number of vignettes along the fictional author's life. As such, it would have been an excellent novel for serializing. There isn't enough action or drive to keep you reading hour after hour, but there is enough charm to keep you coming back. So this is best as a book to work through in pieces when you are between other books or just want a short stretch of light reading.At heart it is the reflections of an undistinguished man with a sense of humor about all the people around him, and about the life he leads but is largely detached from. It is filled with excellent character studies, but that only adds to the episodic nature of the journey. It is a book worth reading, but only on its own terms. Don't expect to be sucked in and swept away."
3,The Last Time,"This is the first and last time I take a literary suggestion from People Magazine. They raved, I bought, I couldn't finish. I am going to pick it back up again becuase the writing was strong, but it wasn't holding my attention. I am giving it another chance becuase the characters are intriguing, I have a feeling they are going to do something."
1,Not as good as expected,"The reviews were great, the plot sounded promising and intriguing but frankly, I found it difficult to read from the first page. I tried valiantly to stick with it but before long, it became a sleep aid.It's fairly convoluted, wordy and difficult to follow."
3,ASTD Books are Great!,"I gave this book only 3 stars, not because of any lack of quaility. The content is not new. But the format and usability is worth 5 stars. This is a very functional book if you're involved in organizational training. This book has several diferent modules to use in short or long-term training. If you work in organization training -- this is a must buy. Very functional!"
1,ugh!,"i rec'd this as a gift.At first it was easy to use-the manual was clear & concise & i had no troubles. then the bobbin began to jam & i had to reset the bobbin tension every time i sewed. to do this,you need to remove the bobbin casing; well! on one occasion the entire casing ""sprung"" apart & i had to spend an hour trying to get it back together. it happened again...and again...by the 4th time i just put it back in the box, in the back of my closet, & drug out my mother's Singer Rocketeer 500A!(had to take it to the local repair shop to get a clean & fix a broken bobbin casing part),but my experience w/the esteem model was not at all satisfactory. when i sew ( which is often) i want a machine i can depend on!"
2,Problems.,"It worked well at first. Then it started having little problems. Then it wouldn't make button holes. Now the bobbin wont wind. and of course, it isn't easy to replace the part needed. I can't even find the part needed.I'm just going to buy a new one, and not a singer. I've always liked them in the past, but this one gave me nothing but trouble. It's lucky it hasn't gone out the window."
3,Australian Melodic Metal..... between 3 and 4 stars.,"Australia doesn't produce much quality metal normally, usually only numbskull hard rock. But there are some acts like Dungeon, Black Majesty and Vanishing Point that have bucked the trend a touch over the years.VP play melodic metal. Similar outfits might include Supreme Majesty, Statovarius in heavy mode or a number of other Euro metal bands.Musically competent musicianship, nothing spectacular but with good use of hight and low end sound, creating a full sound to back Silvio Massaros' rich, though not overly powerful pipes. He is a quality singer but he's not Tobias Sammet in terms of ability to wail nor is he Timo Kotipelto in terms of range.Songs open out before the listener nicely, great melodies that roll along are the name of the game here. They need something extra to take them to the next level yet this is still a worthy band. Certainly something to check out for lovers of melodic metal. And you know who you are......"
5,a nouvellette's treasure,"Ever remembered a sentence or two from the book and, still later on, didn't recall where it comes from? Well, there is one in the 'The lost boy' that I'd say I'll never forget. It goes: 'Light came and went and came again...' I would believe this is the best definition of Time I've ever read. It tells what we all already know - that the Time is here, all around, that it passes, eternally, incessantly, giving us no chance to do anything about it. And although there's much more to the nouvellette, it's worth reading it from the beginning to the end. It's 'realness' moves you all along."
5,Cure' of Ars is relevant today,"Rutler himself recommends ""better"" biographies of John Vianney for more comprehensive narration of the plain facts about his life. This book adds the ""Rutler dimension"", which studies the man's life and its impact on thousands within the context of the Enlightenment and the disruptive forces of the French Revolution. Throughout the book, while the focus is on this uniquely selfless priest, there is meaningful relevance to the a modern world deracinated from its Christian roots and steeped in secularism. This is both biograph and history, but few books of these genre are also inspirational. This is a scholarly book, but extremely engaging and entertaining in both narrative and the philosophical quality of the ideas presented."
2,"If you like to be preached to, this is the book for you!","I purchased this book thinking I would be able to read about the Cure of Ars. I had to wade through 9/10 preaching and platitudes to read the 1/10 of the book about the Cure. If you are wanting a biography of the Cure, this is NOT the book for you. If you are conservative Catholic or christian, you may appreciate the ramblings of the author and his opinions about everything from feminism to Pope John-Paul's speeches."
1,dont buy this toy,this is not a good toy It takes forever to set up and then is not much fun to play with.
1,"Horrible Game, Waste of money",I got this game for my daughter for Christmas last year and it was a horrible waste of money. There are so many pieces to the board that it was almost impossible to put together. When we finally put it together it wouldn't stay together. We never got it to stay together long enough to play. After that we never bothered trying again and eventually threw it away. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
5,First Christmas,"I grew up with my grandparents, and was introduced to the gravel that is the voice of Kenny Rogers at a very early age. One of my aunts gave me a cassette of Christmas Wishes when I was about five years old, and it was the first Christmas tape I had ever owned. My grandfather finally forbid me to play it anymore because not only was it beginning to drive him insane, but I was about to warp the tape. I'm 21 years old now, and I have more than 50 Christmas CDs in my collection, but this album still is the one I go back to. It's the one playing at dinner on Christmas Eve, and Christmas morning when we're all opening our presents. Not to wax poetic, but it's a truly timeless album. I remember laying in bed when I was a kid, singing these songs softly to myself until I'd finally fall asleep. It's one that I'll have so my kids can drive me insane with it in the future."
2,not a great deal,"I purchased this item because I thought I was getting a bargain with the stainless steel and glass. It was very poorly built however and the screen constantly shakes at a 35 degree angle when pouring liquid. When it arrived, the screen had fallen out, and I had to fix the uncoiled spring in order to make the thing work! I should have spent the extra 5 bucks for a real french press."
1,Going right back out the door!,"DO NOT BUY! I don't know what happened in the past few days because previous reviews were good. This is a CHEAP knockoff, shoddy quality, and nothing on the box (except for a bar code sticker) or product denotes who made it or where it was made. Like others have said, the top looks like it's made of tin and it fits loosely in the carafe, with no strainer. The handle has a piece of plastic hanging off of it like it just came out of the mold. We have another BonJour press only a few years old, and it is high quality. This thing is going RIGHT back. I wouldn't have bought this thing for a nickel at a garage sale. Negative 5 stars."
1,Returning Immediately!,We will be returning this item immediately. The press delivered is not the one advertised. No place on the item or its package does the name BonJour appear. If this is what Bonjour offers we will buy another brand. The cover is loose and the filter is ill fitted. The plastic part underneath the cover is coming apart and looks dirty though never used. Also the glass is etched around the top. Not worth $5 much less $35. Save your money!
1,Cheap Knockoff. Not BonJour,"The item delivered was not Bonjour but an cheaply made knockoff. The tin lid and plastic covering underneath had already fell apart by the time I opened the box. Nowhere, on the box, nor the french press itself did it have the name bonjour. The lid was extremely loose on the carafe."
1,"Not item in picture or in description,",The delivered item is a cheap knockoff and not BonJour brand. The plunger is not tight on the glass and leaks grounds over the side. The pictures show the BonJour branding on the glass. The product that arrived had a sticker on the box that said it was BonJour Monet but the glass was not branded. I own one of the BonJour branded one and the one that arrived was clearly not the same product as advertised.
5,Monet 8 Cup French Press,The individual parts are extremely sturdy and well made. It makes the best tasting cofffee ever and it is fairly easy to use. I love it!
1,Good but watch out,"I was given the 12 cup BonJour coffee press as a gift.Once my wife, (non coffee drinker) made sure that nothing was broken, she disposed of the packaging. When I completed my out of town work and was ready to try the coffee press, I found that the filter screen etc. would simply not slide down when the plunger was pressed.Since it was a gift I did not have the receipt or packaging I called the company to check for replacement parts or parts breakdown to see what was missing fully expecting to pay for the missing part. I was told that they do not have parts for sale. I would need to buy a completely new item to get the one missing part.I think this comes under the buyer beware category."
1,"Taste is excellent, beak is very weak.","The beak on this french press broke the first time we washed it. We went on to get a plastic one, that although is not as pretty, is not a safety hazard."
1,the horror,"ordered and reordered, it kept showing up busted, and i went through consumer hell to return it. actually, i'm still in consumer hell. sometimes amazon blows."
3,Cute but Tiny,"If you like a tiny cup of coffee like many Europeans do, this is a great little unit. But if you like an American-sized cup or mug of coffee (8-12 oz.), don't be misled by the ad touting it as a 3-cup unit. We returned it for a larger model because as cute and nicely made as it is, it barely makes one good-sized cup."
4,"as expected, good","It's as good as one would expect from this type and brand. My only complaint is that they tout the advantage of having another screen that slides in place of the spout as it's poured, but it would have to be a tight seal to actually work as a screen, and it's not. It's just a gimmick. Aside from that it performs as expected."
5,Very nice message,Good for Dad's who just need a little reassurance that they are handling life's situations in a way that will assure a child that they are always loved even if things happen that Dad isn't very happy about.
4,Nice,Its a cute book did not catch my daughters interest right away but she enjoyed the pictures story line is ok but nothing great. Not sure if I would buy it again.
5,Power of Unconditional Love,Sometimes fathers are made to think that they are expendable. They aren't. Fathers provide a very significant grounding influence in a child's life and helps the child to grow into a balanced adult. This book will delight both the father and the child because it is a book about the unconditional love of a father for his child written for both to enjoy.
5,Adorable!,"I borrowed this book from the library to read to my 3-year old. As I'm reading it, I laugh at some of the lines. In my role as a full-time, impatient mom, I am the one who says the scolding lines that the dad in the book avoids saying. My husband is every bit the part of the doting dad in this book. This book is a wonderful reminder of what raising a child is all about - it's not just the rules that we have to have but the freedom to let ourselves have fun and show our kids how to enjoy life."
1,Rip Off--don't waste your money,"Had the vinyl copy many years ago and basically wore it out beyond playability. Downloaded this from Amazon, hoping to hear the entire score (the vinyl had only half the song selections, but was a very cohesive piece of work). Amazon has chopped these songs up so pathetically bad as to really make this unlistenable. Many (all) of the songs are abruptly cut short in order to make them fit within one download, and the fluidity is gone: no pauses between songs--in fact there is OVERLAP, the segues between many songs are gone, and the entire score is, at best, choppy. What a shame...this was a true masterpiece of Byrne's. Overall this is a very amateurish compilation. Sound quality is good, but if I could give it no stars, I would."
2,Experimental Music.,"This album contains a lot of experimental music, with a few early Talking Heads type songs sprinkled in. If you like Brian Eno's experimental music, you will like this album."
4,"A good, sweeping history","This book offers a good, sweeping history of United States foreign policy from independence through the present. The author's Old/New Testment metaphor is useful, and his arguments are for the most part convincing. Some more background as to the role of the colonial wars in forging American identity would make the work more complete, but what is here is worth the read."
2,Looks ok but i miss the old style,i bought this because i have just about all the other hallmark star trek ships but it does not look like any of the others for one it is metal and its really heavy so it bends down the xmas tree branchs
4,check the date,i didnt realize it was from 1999. some of the road around me are out of date. otherwise the book is fine.
4,Killer froth,"I bought this product so that I could make lattes at home. It froths milk perfectly, but does not steam milk like the frothers at the coffee shops do. Not sure how it does for whipping cream."
1,Did not work for me,"Got maybe a quarter-inch of foam. VEry disappointing. The $2.50 foamer from IKEA gave me so much foam I had to be careful, but it seized-up after about two-months."
3,"Works well, but not the best choice for coffee","I bought this product because my old frother broke and I needed a new one for my daily coffee. This device is very stable and pretty, but when it comes to milk froth a less sophisticated version sometimes works better. The problem is that the froth doesn't last long. This product is quite strong ('turbo') and it is hard to make froth without messing up the kitchen.I guess this turbo frother could also produce whipped cream.Overall good quality, but depends on what it is needed for."
3,"Good value, but performance is so-so.","This frother is quite cheap so it's difficult to be too hard on it. However I believe that if money isn't an option you can do better. From my experience, frothers with a wire-wound wisk produce more froth than this unit. It would be nice to be able to interchange the whisk, but unfortunately it's fixed. I was also disappointed to find that my frother was missing an adhesive attachment ring which allows it to be hung from a vertical surface. Should have been in the box but wasn't. I can't be bothered complaining.Bottom line: this is worth $8, but no more."
1,Not so turbo,"Not a very good product. I've used many bonjours in the past and currently, but this one broke in two days. The bottom of the frother came unattached and could not be super-glued back on."
5,More than Just a Frother,"This Turbo Frother is NOT just for Frothing and anyone who only uses it in that matter is underusing this product. This frother is also an emulsifier and drink mixer. It will totally emuslify eggs so that you don't see any streaks (like in a carton of liquid eggs) , making it perfectly yellow which improves the taste of scrambled eggs or omlets. It's also great when a recipe calls for beaten eggs. This product does splater a bit, however, there are 2 remedies. #1 using a taller glass. #2 if you keep the disk submerged slighlty it won't splatter at all. Use it to emuslify salad dressings which can stay combined without seperating for up to two weeks. emuslify any liquid ingredients that normally sepearte. Use in shakes or weight loss drinks. The mixing/ emusifying choices are endless, and I think it is a great gadget added to any bakers collection. I don't use it as a fronther, I use it as an emulsifier for my baking."
5,Best battery-powered hand mixer I've used,"I've had one of these for about 5 years, used it close to daily, and I swear by it. What sets this one apart from other hand mixers is the torque. The 4 AA batteries allow it to pack more of a punch than 2-battery mixers, and the RPMs it can produce will thoroughly mix or froth any drink.I use mine for powdered protien shakes, and it always produces a foamy creamy shake that tastes better than the pre-mixed ones. There are a lot of cheaper, and smaller mixers of this type, but none which can consistantly produce these results."
4,The Tea House on Mulberry Street,I thought this book was a wonderful read. Ms. Owens draws you into the lives of each and every character. I couldn't wait to return everytime I had to leave them.
3,Not Maeve Binchy nor Joanna Trollope but...,"I bought this book while on holiday because the review on the front cover from the Irish Independent said, ""Maeve Binchy meets Joanna Trollope...Gives you a warm glow like a nice cup of tea."" I was disapointed in it because it was a quick, simple read and not at all like either of those authors. Those two authors tell a meaningful, entertaining story while making you think about friendships, life choices and love. This book tells a entertaining story with little substance. Pick it up for what it is and you'll be entertained for a few hours."
4,Gentle reading,Enjoyed this gentle story that keeps you capatured and you feel that you know the people in the story and were they live. It kept me interested all the way though
2,only OK,"Found this book rather simplistic and not very engrossing. I prefer a book that, along with the stories of its characters, adds layers of thoughtfulness. The Sunday Philosophers Club series by Alexander McCall Smith comes to mind, which I find much more interesting and thought provoking than this book."
3,A sweet place to stop,"This book is character driven and moves quickly. The stories are interesting, and the dialog keeps you entertained. My only regret was there were too many affairs and not enough happiness. It is a cleaver book very much like Meauve Binchy's novels. If you need a quick lite story this is a sweet cup of tea."
5,Tea House On Mulberry Street,Loved the book and made the Cherry Cheesecake recipe for my family. They the loved cheesecake.
3,Playing FAVORITES,"A good rule of thumb for a Christmas album--even a budgetline release--is to throw in holiday surprises along with the old standards. Anne Murray's MY CHRISTMAS FAVORITES may be quite literally that; old favorites personally selected by Anne herself. But even then you could still have a relatively new Christmas favorite as well. I wouldn't mind hearing Annie tackle something like Amy Grant's ""Breath of Heaven,"" for instance.Since it is a budget release, I'm not complaining about the album's brevity. Ten songs is reasonable if the price is the same. But the arrangements could have been a bit more inventive. The choral arrangements are just SOOOO Mitch Miller. Anne has always been better served by straightforward, simple arrangements that match her own emotionally direct (but never ornate) vocal delivery.Worth a listen--and the price is right. But it would be nice to hear Anne include a few more contemporary numbers on a Christmas set."
3,MURRAY'S MERRY CHRISTMAS,"Turn on your FM radio anytime after Thanksgiving. Go into any shopping venue. You're sure to be greeted by a Christmas song from Canada's favorite songbird---Anne Murray.MY CHRISTMAS FAVORITES is a pleasant collection of songs that appeared on previous Christmas albums. Murray has a clear crystalline voice--no histrionics or dramatic flourishes, a style that has given her an enduring four decade career. There are no surprises here...professional but formulaic instrumental and choral arrangements. Its delightful background music for the usual holiday activities but doesn't command focused attention. Enjoyable for those who truly savor Christmas music."
5,Incredible Funk,Roger&Zapp Rock&FUnk all through this Disc.The Jams&Grooves Never Let Up.The Music Smokes Non-Stop.The Genius Of Roger is on full display here.More Bounce to the Ounce still Makes Heads Bop.Be Alright is a Great Slow-Jam.Very Essential.
4,Very good album--but let the buyer beware!,"Before purchasing, be aware that this album contains edited (i.e., shorter) versions of ""More Bounce To The Ounce"" and ""Be Alright"". For some (me included), this might be sufficient. However, others might want the extended versions that probably were included on the original release.Amazon notes the actual lengths of the songs on the product page--so no false advertising here.Otherwise, a nice variety of funky sounds."
4,This One Song Changed The Face Of Black Music...,"While this artist and LP have a definate P-Funk influence, Roger Troutman is no less a brilliant musician himself. The same way James Brown took the African-American experience (like Hendrix, Sly Stone & others) to a different level, so did Roger & Zapp with ""More Bounce To The Ounce."" It was, and is, like nothing ever heard before. Just like Larry Graham's bass changed the face of R/B and funk, so did ""More Bounce."" The whole 9 minutes of the song is irresistable. It opened the door for street funk, which gave way to another type of ""funk"": Hip-Hop and Rap. This one song has probably been ""sampled"" the most by young rappers and R/B artists alike...and they continue to this day! This LP is a defining moment in Black music. Not only is Roger a master at the ""talk box"" (that computerized voice thing you hear) his deep blues committments come shining through. Enjoy this LP. They had to re-issue it, the grooves never cooled off. :-)"
3,Great writing; Questionable writer,"I, too, thought that this author expresses herself very well on paper. She is articulate and I think she knows it. Like other readers, I'm not sure exactly what she was about, fiddling with the raw emotions of the soldier she calls K. She's a married woman flirting with this soldier, and then near the end of the book she begins flirting with still another man. Makes you wonder if she made a habit of tearing stories out of people whatever the cost. Surely she could have shown enough pure journalistic interest in this African that he would likely have shared his emotional life story. If she had, there would be no question that, paired with her extensive writing talent, she would have a true winner of a book. Anyway, all I can say is that I enjoyed the story but recoiled a bit from the author."
2,A Twist on the Truth,"A well written and fairly well researched book... and an immense disappointment. A married woman, happily undertaking an ""adventure"" in landmine-ridden Mozambique with a man who is clearly in love with her. Sadly this, together with the fact that yet another unmarried man also falls for her charms, completely detracts from the story. Furthermore, I am a displaced Zimbabwea, and my father and husband both fought on the wrong side of that war. Their memories of that time are somewhat different to Ms Fuller's, and it's very doubtful that a man as tragic and scarred by his internal demons as K would open his heart to this relatively unknown woman. Having read Peter Godwin's excellent ""Mukiwa"" and ""When the Crocodile Eats the Sun"" I can honestly say this book falls a distant way behind those two."
2,Making a Hash of It,"In the end, the reader is left wondering why the Who, What, Where, When is not complemented with the longed-for Why. Namely, why a book that slams to a dead-end? Fuller attempts unsuccessfully (as an afterthought?) to depict herself as someone much in need of ""closure"" (not her term) with respect to her white-colonial childhood in war-torn Zimbabwe, and in so doing is overly obtuse in sporadic representations of empathy with ruined lives, black and white. Her stylish, semi-metaphorical descriptions of African ambiance too often seem detached from larger literary purpose, amounting on the whole to high-flown travelogue. The impulsiveness of her travels with a psychically (pre?)-damaged war veteran leads her, and us, nowhere except to disgruntling uncertainties about her, the narrator. Irresolution, multifariously manifested, unfortunately scribbles the book."
1,A Big Disappointment,"With so few books about the conflict in Rhodesia, it's disappointing when somebody comes up with something that is so factually inaccurate. Although the story is well written, there are too many mistakes - or exaggerations - to make it a plausible or credible account of the Rhodesian war, and the people who fought it.Two thumbs down."
3,Insightful yet annoying,Provides good insight into the life of a soldier during the Rhodesian war and is appropriately graphic in parts. The author's ralationship with her subject gets a little tedious and annoying. Worth reading but there are better books out there about the experiences of Rhodesian soldiers.
1,Scribbling A Book,"This was a huge disappointment for me because I really enjoyed Fuller's book, ""Let's Don't Go To The Dogs Tonight."" Problems with this title included a lack of focus for the first half, followed by an apology for a wartime event (during the Rhodesian conflict) that suddenly becomes a vehicle for slandering the efforts of those who fought against communism and terrorism. I tried to read on, but after a few more pages my copy found its way into a McDonald's trash can near Gate 17 in Reagan National."
2,Disappointing,"This was definitely a let-down after ""Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight"", which I thoroughly enjoyed. I found ""Scribbling"" to be rambling and without purpose at times. It seems unfinished and incomplete."
3,Factually inaccurate,"I bought this book because I loved Alexandra Fuller's first book. However, this one is riddled with factual errors. First, I was born, raised and educated in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. There is not and never has been an Mweni junior school. Milton junior and senior were popular with Bulawayo's jewish community. Is this what K means? and whose error is it? K's or the author's?Second, even the cover is wrong. Zimbabwe's civil war occured during approximately 1967 and 1980. By 1981, the date mentioned on the fly leaf, the war had been over for more than a year.Not up to the high standard of the first book, I fear."
2,Dishonest Account of Africa,"The author should have stated that this book was fictitious rather than stringing the reader along. The first few chapters are engaging, but it is unrealistic that she would leave her family and, on a whim, travel with ""K"" to his old Rhodesian War haunts. It was also a fallacy to suggest that she was so naive as to not pick up on his attraction for her. I was truly dissapointed by the self-promoting arrogance of this author and the trivialized generalizations that were haphazardly made about Africa. A true waste of time."
2,Myth creator,"After reading Fuller's first book I was surprised at the uncritical praise given to it. It was hardly credible given her age at the time of the events. The post-modernists might excuse her but given that it was supposedly autobiographical I found it hard to trust. The same is true of her latest work. There is an air of exaggeration about it that left me wondering whether this is a work of fact or fiction. Ms. Fuller certainly seems to have some trouble with depicting other than an extremely biased and overly emotional rendition of life in post-colonial Africa. Perhaps the fact that she has chosen to live in the USA contributes to her angst but if one wants to balance out the story she tells I suggest Paul Theroux's ""Dark Star"" and the works of others. There are far more intelligent and better written books on the market than that which Ms Fuller has written."
4,Very well written,"I've found this very informative, as I have just started learning about Rhodesia, with only small tidbits from old SOFs"
4,Conventional book,"Redoubtable writer Alfred Price writed a good book, which gives a general picture of the pilots who fought in this kind of airplane. The plates, as always, are very well drawned and explains, with his legends, a lot about the pilots. Good job."
4,Great visual dictionary,"Very good and helpful visual dictionary, but I could not give it 5 stars because it lacks the plural form of the nouns. I also wish that the pictures pertained more to German culture. The picture of the textbook showed the textbook with korean writing. There also wasn't any vocabulary of German specific foods.Other than that, I really enjoy this book and I am glad I bought it. The chapters include People, Appearance, Health, Home, Services, Shopping, Food, Eating Out, Study, Work, Transportation, Sports, Leisure, Environment, and Reference(calendar, numbers, and almost all of the countries)."
1,Lonely no more,"Being a huge Matchbox 20 fan, I own all of their discs.I just purchased the Back2good disc, and the new Rob Thomas ""Lonely No More"" disc.What a mistake! For $13, the Rob Thomas disc contains 2 versions of the cut ""lonely no more"": A poor live cut, and the standard issue studio version. Less than 8 minutes of music for $13.00!What a rip-off.The Matchbox20 disc back2good isn`t much better.Just 3 tracks, less 14 minutes of music, with 2 of the tracks being poor quality MTV things.What a shame that Matchbox 20 and Rob have allowed this trash to be recorded.I could go on and on, but neither of these discs are worth the effort.CAVEAT EMPTOR!From now on, I`ll be much more careful when I purchase music."
1,"""Bored on Thursday""","This book will be a lovely addition to my compost heap. I couldn't find any sense in the character's motivations so the whole mess became a simple, predictable voyage through a hamlet that any five-year-old could have dreamt up. When coming across this one on the shelf, my advice is to keep on browsing."
2,movie is better,this soundtrack is good but the movie and book are about a thousand times better. I would recommend buying it used maybe but not in a cd store for like $16.00 but all in all it was OK.
3,Good EOS-3 guide,"Good complement to the sometimes ambiguous owner's manual: the different metering and autofocus systems are well explained, and allow you to learn how to get the best of this camera.The worse part is, IMO, the flash operation: the book is really weak on this topic, and it disappointed me a lot."
4,Rage at Dawn,"You have to like Randolph Scott to like this movie and I do, Scott is methodical in everything he does from his walk to his facial features. The movie is very well done and it is some what true showing a part of history in the early American West. Life was hard back then, it wasn't a cake walk, a person had to stand for what they believed in, and not pussy foot around any situation. If you are looking for a movie to in enjoy may I suggest Rage at Dawn you won't be disapointed."
2,There are much better Scott films,"I have liked most of the Scott films, but this I found a rather tedious film. Scott just follows the gang and does not do much. The story is very predictable. Rather, look for the Boetticher films."
2,"Movie = 2.5 stars, Video Transfer = 1.5 stars","This review is for the Roan DVD. The movie is an okay western, nothing special, but it has some good moments, particularly those involving the corrupt officials of the town. The transfer, unfortunately, is bad. The color is uneven, the contrast is a mess, and the sharpness and clarity leave a lot to be desired. So I do NOT recommend the Roan version of this film."
5,Rage at Dawn,"This is a well done movie that is a true story of The Reno Brothers....outlaws. It is perfected by the star....Randolph Scott, as the under cover lawman, who brings the outlaws to justice."
5,Awesome game!,"I bought this game for my 7yr old nephew who LOVES O.C.C.I have to admit though, even some of the things on the DVD's had me stumped! One of the hardest games to play is you'll hear the sound of an engine starting up, and you have to guess the bike. Crazy, but also a lot of fun for fans of the show."
5,CHAKRA/BRAINWAVE HARMONIZER,"The CD I got is not the one showing in the picture. It is TANATRA OF SOUND HARMONIZER and the one I asked for is CHAKRA/BRAIN HARMONIZER, an also the picture in the case is different. I was not pleased with the result. I kept the CD, but still, is not the one I wanted.My experience : BADI am a very old amazon customer. This is the first time I have such a bad experience."
5,Highly recommended,"I've never tried listening to these types of things, but I have a lot of stress in my life and find it very difficult to fall asleep, stay sleeping, and to wake up feeling refreshed. I got this CD for Christmas and I'd have to say I highly recommend it to anyone looking to feel completely relaxed and centered. I actually fell right asleep feeling very peaceful and I actually woke up earlier than usual with lots of energy and feeling extremely refreshed. I also found it really nice to cozy up next to a candle with. The booklet was very helpful for me to know what I should expect from listening and the basics to help me feel the full impact of the music. This gets an A+ from me."
1,digital hygrometer,"had an earlier oen of this same model and it had been checked against professional equipment and found to be accuratethe latest version has an additional button for additional memory but the unit was very slow to respond to changes in the air and worse yet, it read 6 to 7 point higher in humidity. THe plastic fold-out table-top stand fell off immediately - the usual ""made in china"" problemthis is a do not buy. pity, the previous omes were fairly good and I had several and all regtistered with a 2 pts of one another in humidity"
4,Very helpful,"I found Superlearning 2000 to provide a wide array of relaxation techniques and advice on classical music. At some points, the authors also discuss using affirmations to prod the unconscious to whatever we seek to achieve. While I found the book to be packed with good advice and well worth the reading, I found two problems: the paperback version is 470+ pages long, and, to paraphrase another reviewer, the authors *really* want to sell you this book and their techniques. Most of the stories they provide are interesting, but at times I felt as if I was stuck in a very long commericial. Some trimming would have helped an already good book."
1,Don't You Believe It!,"If you like to listen to fluff, then by all means, buy this tape. You don't get any information on how to execute any of this information, or anything else useful. What you do get is something that is akin to hearing about someone else that is doing really well. You hear it, and it's nice, but YOU want to know how to do it yourself. That is where this tape falls woefully short."
3,Don't Get Your Hopes Up,"Interesting and very well researched. But after buying their tapes and trying out the ""classical music"" technique they promote, I didn't experience the accelerated learning that was promised. (The exaggerated claims of most of these self-help courses do get annoying after a while.)"
2,"Mildly interesting at first, then gets rapidly annoying.","I found this book to be interesting, in that it discusses various techniques for increasing mental capacity and memory retention. These sections I found moderately interesting and useful. Especially interesting is the idea that classical music can increase intelligence. This, at least, is a technique you can employ without too much trouble. However, the numerous sections on ""positive affirmations"" and how to breathe properly were extremely annoying. I skipped the last few chapters because I couldn't stand it any more. I kept thinking of that neurotic, self-affirming sissy character from ""Saturday Night Live."" If you followed all this book's details for breathing and repeating things to yourself, you could become a truly neurotic and self-absorbed person. Also, the writing style was repetitive and boring. Too much ""how-to,"" and not enough ""why?"""
1,Is this a book or a commercial?,"I must confess right off the bat that I didn't finish reading this book (or listening; I'm reviewing the audio version). After 20 minutes of the author telling me how great Accelerated Learning is, why it's better than traditional learning methods, and droning off a seemingly endless list of ""sucess stories"" about people who have used the method, I found myself thinking, ""are you ever going to get to the point, and tell me the actual method, or is this entire book nothing but a sales pitch?""Maybe they should re-title the book: ""Why Superlearning is the greatest thing since sliced bread"", with a sub-title ""We're not going to actually tell you anything about our method, just convince you why you should be excited about it"".Perhaps readers with more patience than I will be richly rewarded by sticking it out, assuming the authors ever do get to the point. Note to authors: I already bought the book; you don't need to spend half its contents selling it to me again."
3,"This book was interesting, but at the same time, confusing..","Bought the book in December 1998 while visiting the Philippines, have utilized several of the techniques in studying for college exams, found the various sections devoted to relaxing, well....relaxing! However, the chapters covering how to make your own superlearning tapes got to be a bit confusing, I didn't know which technique would have been appropiate for my subjects, a lot of information to take in all at once......."
5,Exellent,"Incredible book written by unusual autors. I wander how people can read this book and don""t understand its value.Thanks to autors for remarkable reaserch.Exellent."
1,My comment is for the Audio Cassette of Superling 2000,"I hearded all the audio cassette, but this is like when you are reading only the introduction of a book withoutthe rest of it, no step by step instructions, nothing you are listening only cientific reseach without telling you what to do and how. For anyone that want to buy this audio-tape my recomendation is: You are spending your money."
1,I would give this less than one star if I could,"This work is a waste of time and money. My wife and I listened to the audio cassette while commutting and laughed out loud at how pathetically trite the material was. Really, blow this one off - it's worthless. I would have returned it to the store if not for store policy on opened audio cassettes. I will probably recycle the cassette and record some music over it. Really."
5,Great way to Superlearn,This is the 2nd time I have purchased the Super Learning book. Strongly recommend it.Received product in excellent condition.
5,Literary Criticism for The Wife of Bath,"This book has historical context; The Wife's prologue and tale; New Historicism Criticism regarding The Wife; Marxism and Psychoanalytic Criticism; and Deconstruction and Feminist Criticism. For anyone doing a paper, class, or any type of study regarding The Wife of Bath, this is an excellent book to have. It is easy to read and understand. You get to view the Wife of Bath from 5 different critical perspectives and each chapter ends with a Works Cited page which is an excellent reference for further research."
4,vietnam,great collection - have not seen it yet - is on VHS but for the very low price i could not pass it up -
5,Courageous and Well Written,"This book is written with such clarity, love and hope. After surviving being shot in the head by her husband, Ms. Morris-Grant uses her total recall of the events leading up to and following that event to give readers a clear understanding of the confusing/contradictory emotions and circumstances that make domestic violence so dangerous and difficult to escape. A must read for anyone who is supporting someone as they deal with an abusive relationship."
3,Good for Light Loads,"This is an okay rack for light loads. I had a small tent strapped to it on a bike trip and it tended to sway a little side to side. This fatigued the eyelets at the bottom of the support bars where it screws to the bike frame. The second day of the ride, one of the eyelets broke. Be sure to connect it rigidly at the front of the rack to limit sidesway."
2,Great music but horrible transfer from master,"This is one of my favorite albums but the transfer from analog to digital is really horrible. I can not listen to it. It sounds like it was recorded under water. I put on the vinyl copy when I want to dance this mess around.Please Warner Bros. Remaster this CD! To you buyers, spring for the compilation CD's if you have to have any of these songs in the digital format."
3,Some Great Stuff; Some Filler Material,"I loved the first B-52's album for its wackiness and great beats. This second outing has some great material (Party Out of Bounds, Private Idaho, Give Me Back My Man). The ""first side"" is fully realized in the style of the first album. The ""second side"" of Devil in my Car, Quiche Lorraine (despite its cuteness), Strobe Light and 53 Miles West of Venus don't have the energy or consistency of the other side.I know it's heresy to dis the B-52's in any way, but only 1/2 of this 1980's album is worth repeated listenings."
4,More consistent than debut,"Although only ""Private Idaho"" (and possibly ""Strobe Light"") is as perfect a track as ""Planet Claire"" ""Dance This Mess Around"" or ""Rock Lobster"" from the first album, the B-52's second release, as a start-to-finish listen, is actually a more solid effort. While the first album's stregth is all but exhausted on the first four tracks (back in the vinyl days, I bet a lot of folks wore out side 1 without playing side 2 more than once or twice), this one keeps the party moving till the end.The only throwaway in my opinion is Quiche Lorraine. Other than that, you get a lot of strong beats, excellent playing, and the classic B-52 sound. ""Dirty Back Road"" is a great late-night driving song.All in all a perfect blend of goofiness and new-wave spunk, played and sung (except of course for Fred, but Fred is ... well, Fred) with verve and skill. Listen to the drums closely and hear the subtle accents - interesting but never overbearing!"
5,Provides a well-rounded view of the man and his career,"This book on legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix takes an unusual turn, gathering eyewitness recollections of his life through the words of his admirers, friends and close observers. From his childhood experiences through adulthood, this uses quotes from documentaries, books, newspapers, TV and Internet sites as well as new interviews to provide a well-rounded view of the man and his career."
2,Say no to Coby,"The sound on the unit is very good. You can recharge rechargeable batteries while in the unit. Only one inch thick. These are things that earn the CD player two stars.The quality/durability of this Coby CD player is horrid! It only lasted a few months, just like the earlier review. It also skipped all the time, meaning the skip-protection barely worked at all, and it's the stupid meter protection, the one where you have to wait for your skip-protection, which in reality isn't TRUE SKIP-PROTECTION.There are a few features, but for $30, a CD player that lasts a few months isn't worth that. Don't buy."
3,Cheap Crap,"The title explains it all. Why would you get one of these with all the solid state players out there. Skipped, battery life poor... Need I go on.."
5,Works!,"These work nicely, and go very well together. I built wooden containers to house these, and they work great! (unlike the sliding mechanism the drawers are on). No complaints here! They are durable, and they hold your DVDs/CDs. I wish they were less expensive... but alas, they are cheaper than at a brick-and-mortar store! The cheapest I have found."
4,The little-known 1989 remake of the classic TV show.,"This is an official release of two episodes from the -second- time Kimba was brought to the TV screen. Some say this is the last project that Kimba's creator, Osamu Tezuka, worked on. It is different, a re-working of the old story, and takes some getting used to for us old fans. In some ways the presentation is disappointing; it feels like the series was altered for a modern Saturday Morning TV audience. The new story arc is interesting, tho, and I consider the series very much worth seeing. I'll be buying every tape they release.The first tape in this series (""Successor of Legend"") is a must, since it sets up the story line. This episodes on this tape are very interesting and show the little white lion at near his best."
4,Good Survey of Voice Theory and Practice,"'The Vocal Vision' is a good survey of recent thinking about voice training and performance. It's primarily theoretical rather than practical applications; historical rather than current.The discussion of John Barrymore's voice training by Margaret Carrington was worth the price of the book to me.In sum, whether you find value in this book depends on what you're seeking."
2,"ZZ Top's Worst ""Pre-Elecctronica"" Release....","Before ZZ Top went digital with albums like ""Eliminator"" & ""Afterburner"", they were an analog, tube-amp, real live drum sound, blues soaked band lead by the killer guitar of Billy G.This album marks the end of the ""cheap sunglass"" era ZZ Top.It comes off with the band sounding tired and very unispired. With the exception of a few killer tunes like ""Tube Snake Boogie"", ""Pearl Necklace"" & ""Party On The Patio"" this release sounds like a bunch of songs that were headed for the ""Deguello"" scrap-heap. I would give this 3 stars if it were not for one of the worst songs ZZ Top ever recorded ""Heaven, Hell Or Houston"". I find the song virtually unlistenable (at least in the cd format you have the skip track button...20 years ago I'd have to lift the needle by hand to get to ""Party on the Patio""). As a ZZ Top fan, ya gotta have it...but it doesn't mean you'll play it a whole lot."
5,ZZ Topp,"What can you really say about ZZ Topp, We just seen them again in person at a concert, They are still just as good as the first time we saw them. Glad you still had their CD's. Thanks!!"
2,Kind of a let down,"I love ZZ Top but I find it hard to listen to El Loco I think this may be ZZ Tops worst album, before the 80's that is.'Tube Snake Boggie' is a ZZ Top classic and the best song on the album. Its got killer guitar from the legendary Mr. Gibbons. its a nice bluesy peice of music that is sure to satisfy.'Heaven Hell Or Houston' is another great Bluesy rocker with all the great quallittys that Tube Snake Boggie Has.'Pearl Neckles' what is this.... A Ballad? From ZZ Top? yes, and a damn good one at that. Billy Gibbons guitar playing is completly amazing on 'Pearl Neckless' and the songs not about what youthink its about which makes it that much better.Other then 'Tube Snake Boggie' 'Heaven Hell Or houston' and 'Pearl neckless' El loco really lacks musical quality! Dont buy unless you are a true ZZ Top fan, even then its not really worth it!"
1,So not interested,"Bought this thinking it was a great deal and it held some of my favorite songs. Errr, wrong! They weren't what I hoped for and the price was ridiculous. Better off looking to other collections."
5,The best!!!,"This is the BEST hairspray I have ever used in my life! It is EXTREME hold! I have super straight hair and this hairspray allows me to curl, tease, whatever I want."
3,Good News,"Apple is releasing all 15 albums re mastered, non Beatle,recordings including Mary's albums this fall. COOL!"
5,She should have steered clear of MCCartney,"At first I thought this album was elevator muzak....but beware!!! Turn the treble up on your stereo! Mary has such a high-pitched voice that it will be drowned out by the background band if the treble is improperly set! After fixing that, I found some of the most pleasing sounds in the world emanating from my stereo. I wish that ""Those Were The Days"" had been left out of it. McCartney evidently wanted to keep pushing that song ad infinitum. Unlike ""Postcard,"" most of the muzak was left out of it except ""Que sera sera."" The only question now remains: Why no Welsh folk songs? Didn't McCartney allow her to do any of what she was born for?"
3,Definitive Hopkin,"A lot of hits collections do not assemble all the artist's chart singles...but this one does. All six of Mary's U.S. chart singles are here: THOSE WERE THE DAYS, GOODBYE, TEMMA HARBOUR, QUE SERA SERA, THINK ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN and KNOCK KNOCK WHO'S THERE. Paul McCartney produced TWTD and GOODBYE as well as three others on the cd. (Paul did NOT discover Hopkin as some think - she was discovered by Twiggy!) It's a bit pricy, as it is an import, but it's a hard-to-find collection you may need (and it's still on the original Apple label). Plus it's a kick to hear GOODBYE again after all these years!"
1,dont buy it!,the step mechanism is really tight and sometimes doesnt work at all. we thought it would loosen up but it never did and now it is too late to return. and it slides all around the floor.
3,Difficult for younger kids,"My kids were too young to do this without help. The thread is knotty as well, but that is typical of the thread, not this product in particular."
4,Julia Varady's La traviata,"If La traviata happened in Berlin, it should sound like this edition. Julia Varady is wife of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, and a soprano from Hungary. Varady has typical solid training from east Europe. Though it seems she does not draw lots attention outside the vocal music world, I like Varady's translation pretty much. And she know how to balance between beauty and drama in this Italy Opera.Since Verdi's La traviata is a worldwide master piece, I enjoy to listen to different kind of translation. I owned about 20 edition of La traivata, and this edition is minimum standard in my collection. ( a soprano need to sing at least as good as Varady, then I will buy it!)"
3,3 points for originality and 9 points for content...,"As the first book of the series, _The Harvest_ is a great way to learn about Buffy the Vampire Slayer... that is, if you've never watched the show (at least the first two episodes). If you've watched the television show however, this book is an almost word-for-word transcript of the first two television episodes and runs a little on the dull side of entertainment. If you've never seen the television show, _The Harvest_ is an excellent way to get informed and interested... but if you've seen the series on television, you might want to skip this book (unless you're a collector) and run onto the others..."
3,Eh...,"The Harvest is the same as the pilot episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". Thw writing is very simple and very repetitive. If you like ""Buffy"", it's ok."
3,Nothing New,"There is nothing different about this book and the opening episodes. The dialogue is almost word for word the same, and the action sequences are also the same. This was written well, but there's not much point reading it unless you A -- missed the episode B -- just like me, love Buffy"
4,Novelisation of the first episodes...,"""The Harvest"" is a novelisation based on the first episodes of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series. We are introduced to Buffy Summers, the vampire slayer of her generation, as she arrives in Sunnydale hoping to escape from the vampires and start a new life. It soon becomes apparent that she has picked the wrong town...This was an easy-to-read, well written novelisation. It kept me hooked and I read it straight through in an hour. I have seen both episodes it is based on - Welcome to the Hellmouth and The Harvest - but that didn't stop me from enjoying it. Even though it's pretty much a transcript of each episode, it's interesting to be able to read what the characters are thinking. I recommend this to all Buffy The Vampire Slayer fans.~Jenna~"
4,it's quite good.,"at first i thought the book was going to boring, all about blood and other gory stuff,but when i actually read it,i found to my surprise and amazement,that it was actually quite good and now i quite enjoy reading it. so i would recommend it to other horror book readers."
3,Good for those who memorize episodes to recite to friends,"Word for word, I felt like I could've watched the episode and saved an entire day of reading. As a big fan of BTVS, I expected this to be based on the episodes, but this is too much. Wor for word scripting. I thought the writer just had to write down the lines and sell it."
3,Very true to the pilot episode of the tv show.,"This book is written for a young audience, but manages to capture the spirt and essence of the popular tv show. It is, however, nearly word for word with the script from the first two episodes."
3,Its really just the script,"I am a big BUFFY fan so i was excited when i found the book. However, this and the other books in the series are just the scripts in book form, with the action not very well described. the books lack density and undercurrent writing."
5,the master vampire will rise before sunnydale.,this the fist book i read when i turned 12 my parents bought me this and i was like yeah ok i opened the first page and didn't put it down. the best bit is when Xander and Buffy are in the pipe i highly recomend this book to people it will grip you from start to finsh.
1,"Oh no, what happened.","I thought I was buying something associated with Ornette Coleman's Prime Time and Free-Funk era.Where as Jukebox was an excellent example of this, this album really just falls so flat. It's marred by horrible R&B; singers, worse rappers, Tacuma bass barely shows up on some songs and he displays none of the non-mainstream prowess I've come to associate with him.How could he have gone from Jukebox to this?"
1,Bucket with NO BAIL!,"What a disappointment! This is a beautiful bucket with NO BAIL! I mean, I know these things can come undone, but what sort of business ships things out in such a manner??? This is ridiculous and unacceptable!"
1,defective item,"this item did not work and although I tried to contact the seller for an exchange or return, I received no response."
3,"Very good in itself, but low in other Simon works","Considered in itself, it is a very good album, featuring some moving tracks, like Late in the Evening (the most recognized song on this CD). So Simon fans will like it, but if you take his career as a whole, you wouldn't help to notice that it is not one of his top works. Simon never made a really bad album (even his recent works, Capeman and You're the One are very good); the proof is this One-Trick Pony, which is quite good but nonetheless may be easily regarded as his weakest album.The songs are rather melancholic (I like, personally, ""Nobody""), with the exception of the mentioned Late in the Evening, and Ace in the Hole.And what in the hell did drink that reviewer, Carol Alaniz, when doing her odd review? ""Soundtrack of the movie of the same name""?????"
4,Simon gets you in the mood,"Besides Simon and Garfunkel, this was my first solo Paul Simon album. It's a gem. It's mellow, jazzy and every track is a night track - ie. great to play while chilling out with friends. The CD also comes with extra tracks."
4,Forgotten Simon,"Both the album and the accompanying movie are sadly underrated. The film is a fascinating study of a painful subject. It's not great and inspiring as a story. It's largely watching someone's downfall. To be honest, take out the humour, and this and Spinal Tap are VERY closely related. The songs are good though, and some are fantastic. ""Ace In The Hole"" which is the song most featured in the movie is fantastic and more rocking than you usually think of with Simon. You also get some great of Simon's heady, melodic stuff. This is something that if you like Simon, will come as an unexpected treat. He's done better work, but this is still VERY good!"
2,There are so many better albums by Paul Simon,"The lyrics on the album are mostly self-conscious. Much of the music sounds generic to me, with the electric piano-led band that appears on this album. Go back a few years to ""Still Crazy After All These Years,"" or ahead to ""Hearts and Bones,"" or ""Graceland"" and you'd be much better off. That having been said, Paul Simon is perhaps the greatest songwriter of our time, and even his worst efforts are worth listening to. I also find the writing to be more consistent on his first solo albums ""Paul Simon,"" and ""There Goes Rhymin' Simon."""
5,An excellent album,"Every song is outstanding, but especially ""Jonah"" and ""How the Heart Approaches What it Yearns."" This album is introspective, like HEARTS AND BONES, but significantly better (not so sterile). It's my favorite Paul Simon album, and certainly one of his best overall."
4,Soundtrack is some of Paul Simon's best work.,"If you're looking to start (or add to) your collection of Paul Simon music, this album is a great choice. This is the soundtrack to the movie of the same name, written by, directed by and starring Simon. The movie is just a B movie, but this album is anything but. The title track, 'Late in the Evening' appears for the first time on this album, (later on other CD's and re-arranged for the Concert in the Park CD, 1991) and is a wonderful, uptempo latin-style song with a throbing bass line and a full brass section. Other great songs are 'How the Heart Approaches What It Yearns' and 'Jonah'. The whole album is smooth and features the great Steve Gadd on drums and the late Richard Tee on keyboards."
4,"Warm, weary, intimate","On a cold, grey winter's afternoon or bleak windy night, curl up by the fire with a blanket, a book, a cup of hot chocolate, and this album. Most of the music has a distinctly 1970s sound to it (as did several tracks on Simon's preceding solo albums), with lots of background strings, but there's a weariness to the album's many ballads that transcends being dated. ""How the Heart Approaches What it Yearns"", ""Johah"", ""Nobody"", and most of all ""Long Long Day"" are beautiful, quiet, intimate songs in the same spirit as the title track of HEARTS AND BONES -- but without the boring fluff-pop songs that are found scattered on that album. This is probably the most musically cohesive album from Simon's early solo years, and it's my second-favorite of his solo work (GRACELAND takes top honors. :]"
3,It's a good biography behind the life of a 'blasket',I thought of it as OK because it was kind of slow but still interesting to learn the life behind a 'blasket.'
5,Absolutely essential Steeleye Span,"This album not only shows the brilliance of the group, but showcases the essence of Britain's wealth of folk music which grew out of a mixture of commoner and crown alike. If you owned five albums of British folk music, it should include this album."
5,One of the all time great classic recordings,"This is Steeleye Span at their best. Tim Hart and Maddy Prior are wonderful. The music ranges from somber to lively with a great deal of humor thrown in, British style. It all has historic significance. This was Ashley Hutchins last recording with the group. He is masterful. You will not be disappointed with this work. Francis J. O'Reilly"
4,A Timeless Gem from the 80's,"Despite it's being a badly uneven album, the majority of the album is so revolutionary, creative and at the same time pleasant and enjoyable (a rare combination) that this extraordinary side project by Talking Heads members with a number of other pop-jazz-electronica heavy-hitters continues to stand as a great work of experimental pop.Sometimes laid-back, sometime aggressive, strong and cutting-edge without every being negative, pompous or dark. Expertly performed by creative people who understand entertainment and seem to be doing it more it's own sake than for any contractual obligations."
5,Enjoyable and different,"This album is a real work of art, with lots of imagination. It makes fine background music."
4,"Great Album, But.....","I chose to put my comment here since this is their first (and arguably best) album -WHERE'S THE 'GREATEST HITS' COLLECTION??!!!!!I'd like to see ""Pleasure Of Love"", ""Suboceana"", ""Call Of The Wild"" and ""Devil Does Your Dog Bite?"" (From the ""Married To The Mob"" soundtrack) all on one CD! And while they're at it, they could also tack on those cool live versions of ""Genius Of Love"" and ""Wordy Rappinghood"" from the 12"" of ""Call Of The Wild.""It's not fair that Backstreet Boys and Hillary Duff have 'greatest hits' collections, and they have fewer albums than TTC.Sire Records - Are you listening?? You put this together, and you'll get my $15!!"
5,Amen!,"And where is CTB???? WB releases so much crap but, TTC is da' bomber! If they never release CTB on CD I will never play my LP 'cause I do not want to wear it out even more. WAYYYYYYYYYYYY ahead of there time with, as previously stated, sublime art!"
3,White bread funk,"It's still fun, but very dated. Everything on this album sounds like it was recorded in the stone age - it's that slow. It seems like their more quirky second album has been deleted - shame."
5,Very Pleased,I was more than pleased w/ the item I purchased. It arrived as stated in my purchase order. Will not hesitate to order again.
2,Should've been called Pet Rock,"I think the whole point of this album was to see just what Tina & Co. could get away with. Genius of Love has a pretty good groove, but it's just James & the Flames all synthed up. Wordy Rappinghood was just making fun of the rap scene/sound. I think the rest is making fun of Dave Burn - they're saying the band lost any pretensions of making punk/new-wave and now was just riding the latest pop trends. Of course that didn't stop them from riding Dave's money train thru the 80's!"
1,Horrible,"Don't let Genius Of Love fool you. Although ""Genius"" is one of my favorite songs of all time, this is without question the worst album I have ever bought. Not one of the worst - the single worst album I have ever bought. Stay away!!! I beg of you."
2,2 hits!!,"THE MAIN WORTHWHILE SONGS ON THIS CD ARE OF COURSE, ""GENIOUS OF LOVE"" N' ""UNDER THE BOARDWALK "" NUFF SAID!"
5,Im 26 and I liked it,I enjoyed it. Fun factor is in the learning part. Its meant for kids but I liked it.The kit was easy enough for a child (great) and left out all the cartoons so I didn't feel embarrassed playing with it.I looked at several kits and picked this one. happy i did
2,Not for the classroom,"Pros: Experiments manual. Charged quickly.Cons: Broken after being used half a dozen times. Rubber wheels come off the car too easily.This item is not for class/school use. The wiring to the motor is too close, rigid, and flimsy (particularly the contacts directly attaching the wiring to the motor). The wire that attaches to the motor was broken-off after less than a half dozen uses. It is irreparable/useless now."
1,None of these songs are the originals,"As usual, K-Tel has put out another album of songs labeling them as the originals.. They're not. Don't buy this. A few of them are so badly faked its funny. Unless you like wasting your money."
1,Simple DV to DVD did not pass basic test,"I so wanted this product to work and started with the most basic of functions. I connected my Sony DV camcorder via firewire to the back of the DVDirect Recorder, confirmed the input, put in a DVD-R, and after the unit verified the disc I pushed play on the camcorder and record on the DVD Recorder. The DVDirect unit went into ""Pause"" mode 10 times before my eight minute DV test completed. Each time I would have to manually push play on the camcorder to get it to start recording again. I used the same mini DV tape through my computer direct to a DVD-R without a problem. I am returning the product tomorrow. Sony tech support is never a real option."
3,DVD's require new DVD player,"The recorder worked as expected. However, DVD's recorded have to be played on a recent (under 2 years old) DVD player. Therefore, sharing home movies or pictures may not work."
1,Stay away from Sony VRD - VC20 ! - Coaster Burner,"A true ""Coaster Maker"" . I bought this unit to have a simple stand alone solution to make DVD's from Analog sources.Used media from Sony, Maxcell, Verbatim and Fuji - got one useable DVD on a Fuji Double level ($7 each ). Called Sony 3x they say it is my VCR's.I hooked up the VC20 drive to my computer and downloaded the firmware update (Ver. 4) Still nothing but coasters called Sony and they again said it was my VCR (Sony, Panasonic, Apex)I then tried a different tact - I left the Sony VC20 hooked up to my computer and used WIN-DVD Creator 2 to burn the disk and guess what - ALL the disks Sony, Maxcell, Verbatim and Fuji all play on ALL of 3 of my VCR's!I do not think that the CODEC / Firmware in the Sony when operating in the ""Stand alone mode"" can correctly format & correctly finalize a DVD disk in an Industry standard format.Sony - get your act together !"
1,Failure to deliver ordered Item,"I ordered this item from warehouse_deals through amazon.com on February 28 2006, come the twenty fourth of March it still was not here. I asked amazon where my order was and instead of helping me aquire the desired result. They just gave me back my money and forgot it. Needless to say I am more than dissatisfied."
1,This is a VERY unreliable DVD Recorder (Finalize Error),"I purchased it as a solution to recordong my video tapes onto DVD's. However, out of a bundle pack of DVDs, at least 30% have ""FINALIZE ERROR"". I figured out and there are some compatibility problems. If you are thinking on purchasing this unit, please make sure you have that list, and you know for sure that not every DVD recordable media is compatible with this unit. As a matter of fact, just a few brands. Hopefully SONY should release a better unit sometime soon..."
1,Bad news,"I've had this machine for over a month now, past the return date and have yet to burn one watchable dvd. Sony has been very helpful and they finally said I've got the wrong disks (memorex). I'm trying to record from a sony handycam so you'd think it would be a slam dunk. Not so. I'm not happy and wouldn't recommend this item to anyone."
1,Does NOT sync with older camcorders.,"I own a sony DCR-TRV510 and this device will not sync over the iLINK connection. You can use iLINK to transfer video, you just have to manually start/stop the camcorder when you press REC on the DVD recorder. I called tech support and they said it was a 'known problem'. Too bad they don't note that on the box, on their website, or in the Operating Instructions.I'm using two sony devices, connected by a sony cable, and they don't sync up. What gives?"
2,"Started out great, but then . . .","This product was just what I was looking for in that it promised to provide a relatively easy way to transfer VHS tapes to DVD. Hookup was a breeze. Directions were generally clear. For the first 100 hours or so of recording--spread over several months, by the way--the product worked fine.Out of about 50 DVDs I only had 3 duds, but then I tried Sony DVDs. (The store was out of memorex.) Since then the product has performed horribly. I contacted tech support twice and got no help at all. Oh, they did refer me to their tech support page which, in essense, has no genuine trouble-shooting advice. I'll probably try some different DVDs but the onus should not be on me to find the right DVD to work with this machine. Besides, it's Sony DVDs which aren't working. Strange."
1,Product does not work as advertised.,"The digital i.link connection is not compatible with other Sony devices. I purchased the VC20 and the DCR-TRV480 in order to make high quality transfers of my old Sony Hi8 analog tapes over to DVDs, just as Sony advertises. Although both items have the digital i.link feature, they are not compatible with each other. I have spent two months sending each item back to Sony for testing: Each works fine by itself, but the TRV480 does not send a digital i.link signal that the VC20 will recognize. Sony Tech Support had me purchase another i.link cable, and when that didn't work, they finally acknowledged the compatibility issue, but they have no remedy for it. I found nothing in the Sony literature that warns that these two Sony products will be unable to connect via i.link. I wasted a lot of time and $100 on the second i.link cable and in shipping for testing, and Sony Techs have walked away from the problem. Buyer beware!"
1,Sony interoperability fails,"I bought a DCR-TRV480 D8 and a VRD-VC20 burner to put my old 8mm and D8 tapes on DVD. So far I have tried 3 digital and one analog. One digital lost the sound after 20 minutes. The two-hour analog had no sound at all - two wasted hours. I have spent a few days trying to narrow down the problem. Sony support is fun to work with: ""Contact the storage group"" and ""It must be the camcorder"". When turning on the equipment the DV signal is not recognized until I cycle through the different input options with the tape running. There is no one-button recording on this unit!"
1,THE MORE I DEAL WITH THIS THE ANGRIER I GET!!!,"THE MORE I DEAL WITH THIS THE ANGRIER I GET!!!I bought the VRD-MC3 and the DCR-SR40 because of the way you advertised how you could directly record from one to the other.Not seeing the coded fine print footnote that DOES NOT STATE DIRECTLY THAT ' you can NOT record directly from the DCR-SR40 to the VRD-MC3 on a duel layer DVD""That is stupid!Why would anyone build a video system with a 30 GB drive, then say it is compatible with a burner that they make and then make the largest medium that burner can burn NOT compatible with the video direct record system?When are you going to fix it?I have always thought Sony was ""top of the line"" but i have been severely disappointed with the last 4 Sony products I have purchased and I think I'm gonna start doing something about it.NO THANK YOU!Bruce A. Clark"
2,High Quality Not as Expected,I purchased this unit to record some VHS tapes to DVD. I first tried the SLP setting but was unhappy with the quality of the DVD recording. I then tried the High Quality setting for recording and the quality only improved slightly. This unit does deliver good sound quality in the recordings just that images appear to be fuzzy and slightly out of focus.
1,This product worth is not more than $100...,Recorded disc from the Mini DV Camcorder does play. but the recording disc is blurred and Hangs. it does not playI recommend don't buy this product.
1,Stay away,I sent the unit back to Sony becasue it would just shut off while recording and they said they replaced the hardrive. Now I get one good burn in 5. The only answer Sony gives is use Sony DVD. I'm stuck with a $200 piece of trash
2,HIT AND MISS,"Whatever happened to Sony being the best? Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. Here are some of the problems I encoutered:(1)I went to finalize a disc and after it completed the process, I got a message that the finalizing failed.(2) I had put a brand new disc ( a Sony brand at that) where the disc kept spinning and spinning until finally the message appears ""insert disc"".(3) I had another error stating that it could not read the power source coming from the computer.Luckily I borrowed this drive and did not shell out the cash. What a huge disappointment.I would not recommend this product at all."
4,A Prince album with Morris Day singing lead,"This album contains Get It Up & Cool-The Time's best songs(much better than Jungle Love). And those songs stand as perfect examples of what music used to be,before producers & ""beatmakers"" took over. Both Get It Up & Cool are EXTENDED JAMS full of splendid musicianship-riffs & succulent solos,for people who actually like to LISTEN to music.Songs used to be a showcase of musicianship that required your full attention,now music has been dumbed down for the average listener,so they use less brainpower when listening."
4,Must have for shakespeare lovers,Buy two you will want to keep one and give to a loved one or witty coworker.
1,A Missed Opportunity,"Beware: This book contains factually incorrect information and incorrectly labeled photographs. These obvious inaccuracies were not corrected in the updated, revised edition.What a shame, because it's a missed opportunity to tell the story of this extraordinary and historically important neighborhood."
4,Great tube for kids,"This is a great tube for younger kids. It is very stable and you can put either 1, 2, or 3 kids on it at once. This could end up saving you gas since you won't need to spend as much time tubing to give everyone a turn. One thing that I don't like about this tube is the hard plastic scoop on the bottom that creates the ""rooster tail"" effect when pulling the tube. The plastic scoops tends to gouge the boat cushions or fiberglass decking leaving black marks that are nearly impossible to remove. This tube is also fun for adults who don't want to end up getting dumped in the water at 35 miles per hour. I have used this tube with 3 small adults (all women) and they had a blast. For those looking for a wilder more thrilling tube, this one is not for you."
4,Inflatable Towable Rave Sports Ravenger,We gave our two grandsons age 6 & 10 their choice of over 200 towable blow ups. They narrowed it down to the Rave Sports Ravenger and love riding on boat. Highly recommend this craft.
3,Ravenger 3,Our family had a blast on this towable until it sprung a leak. We followed directions for inflation (which basically said blow up until wrinkles disappear). We took it out three times then noticed it slowly deflating. It had pulled at the seam and formed a small hole. Warranty covered it...thank goodness!
5,an open door into another world,"This is a gut level adventure into Balkan life and music, not by a tourist! I found it a little difficult at first to find it's rythm, but once I did it took off like the rythms that this book is about. To American ears this music could seem odd, but having been exposed to it in my youth I find it invigorating! 7/8, 9/8, 11/8 timing you won't hear on AM radio. Mr. Cartwright has tapped into it and it flows well in his book. Several of the musicians are on YouTube and listening and watching them really made the book pop and come alive. It is funky, real, and might open a door for you into something completely different! Just what I needed!"
1,Do not buy - This product sucks,"I like the idea of what this product could be. Unfortunately it is not. You would expect with buttons A, B, and C on the remote that you could buzz in and then answer with the remote. NO! This toy works on only if you turn you head away from the screen and announce your answer. Both Tiger and Jepordy should be ashamed to put their name on this product as it's obvious no actual ""playability"" testing was done.Do not waste your money."
2,"leaky package, not in aerosol container",Arrived in a leaking package and questionable if in original Aqua Net packaging - not in aerosol container but soft plastic one instead. Still did the trick although very sticky.
4,Good and fast lens,"This is is very sharp and fast. You need to play around with it. With F/8 and shutter speed above 1/500s the lens is very good. You can see the image I posted. It's an old lens but it is excellent when you consider the price. The auto focus is fast. It will not AF with Nikon without motor in the body such as D3100, D5100, and the like. I works great on my D7000.[[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004ZD4A/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title]]"
1,Not the best out there....arrived broken,The plastic case is thin and flimsy. Mine arrived with two corners cracked right where the clear plastic meets the base. Sent back the next day....will look locally for a better product.
1,Liars,Ok so I bought this and it is about 5 inches long and super small. dont waste your money on this crap show case
3,If Looks Could Kill.,"I am not a Fan of Grieco or 21 Jump Street(Except Night at the Roxbury:""Is Johnny Depp Meeting you here?:NO""),This movie is semi-funny and entertaining but It does not get my full attention.The Bad Guys especially the Evil little lady and Richard Daltrey as Agent Blade are the best parts and the exploding Woman in the bedroom,The highlight for me was the Lotus Esprit even though it is not an 80s Turbo Version,Decent flick,1 star for acting and plot and slow pace,3 stars for effort,I saw it free on Netflix so I can't really complain as much."
3,Glaring Errors on the DVD C,"I really like this B-movie.Those who love James Bond movies will appreciate it.However, the DVD cover was not properly edited. There are glaring spelling and grammatical errors. For example, it misspells the word ""agent"" with ""angent"" and uses the phrase ""pedal to medal"" instead of ""pedal to metal."" Obviously the DVD cover was hastily put together.I would have given the DVD 5 stars because I like the movie, except for the DVD's poorly edited DVD cover and its unusually high price (about twice or three times what the DVD is worth in my opinion)."
5,Classic,"Saw this back in the day. It was a departure from the standard movies being pumped out at the time. Great comedy, fantastic story line and every teenage males dream come true. What would you do if your high school trip to europe ended up putting you inside a super fast car with a hot babe and stumbled you into an international spy case? Don't know? Watch the movie, it will make you laugh and even bring back those teenage dreams you had..."
4,"Laughable, action packed movie","I purchased this movie to use as a break for my French classes as it pertains to a high school French trip. It's cute and cheesy with late 80s early 90s style of clothing and discourse. After viewing, students can compare and contrast clothing, hair-styles, language, etc. The film is in English, but class discussion can be carried out in French. As always, preview the movie prior to viewing in class. There is a 3-4 minute scene that maybe questionable."
4,Wrong One,"READ THIS BEFORE BUYING:I JUST RECIEVED MY COPY OF THIS CD, AND IT IS THE WRONG ONE. IT ONLY HAS THE FIRST THREE TRACKS IT SAYS IT HAS.IT DOESN'T HAVE THE LAST THREE SONGS AND VIDEO."
2,"Meh, it could have been better","I just recieved my cd, and I wasn't at all disappointed. I already knew that the last two tracks weren't actually on the CD. So, I already knew what was coming. Anyways, here is how I rate the songs:1. Funeral Of Hearts (Radio Edit), Basically about the same as the Album version. A slow, soft, melody, with some pretty good lyrics, which gets a bit harder in parts as the song goes on. Pretty romantic song, similar to Close To The Flame in my view.2. Funeral Of Hearts (Album Version), ""Read above post""3. Funeral Of Hearts (Acoustic Version), I actually think this may be better than the Album version. I tend to learn towards acoustics in most HIM songs, and I'm not sure why. So, unless you have no other HIM CDs to add to your collection, I would leave this one for awhile."
2,The Biggest Disappointment,Don't order this cd if you are just wanting the video and extra song. The acoustic by Valo isn't even that great and I consider myself a true H.I.M. fan. The CD is not terrible...It's just alright.
1,Weak Zipper,I bought two of these. The zipper on both of them came off the tracks. I highly do not recommend.
1,Bad Zipper,Zipper broke after ten or so uses. Material otherwise seems good though I have only had for one summer. Would recommend purchasing something else.
1,Product is lightweight and poorly made.,"The first time I used the cover, the zipper broke. It is very lightweight and poorly constructed. Spend more for a better product."
2,If You Must,Hard to stuff in the toys. Better off just giving it directly as a treat. But there are other products out there that would be healthier and more satisfying for your dog.
2,Too small,"This item is good for small dogs, but I have two large dogs and the pieces don't fit well into the extreme kong toy. They fall out; thus, it is not very challenging for the animals b/c the treats just fall right out."
3,"Decent fit, but crumbly.","They work well for the small size kong I got them for, but many of the treats in the bag were broken up, which make them pretty useless for stuffing."
5,Award Winning Author,"This book is so awesome, I can hardly find words to tell you how wonderful it is. My wife and I have read this book, and her second book, ""Dancing Around the Throne"" in our devotionals with our kids because of the magnificient lessons that Cherone teaches. She tells true stories about herself or someone she knows, then gives a spiritual lesson she learned from that happening, backs up her insighs with Bible verses, and gives a wonderful drawing to put it all together. Her style is unique, and makes you really stop and think. While her story telling skills are magnificent, the fact that she is an award winning author, a 2004 Who's Who in America, and published internationally, all combine to make you realize that these books are very special, written by someone who is knowledgeable."
5,Great for Children and Adults,"We bought this book as we got our two and six year old boys psyched for Paris, but wound up falling in love with the book ourselves. Dated, sure, but so is Paris.The best part was when we got back, because so many of the small things we did were in there (like boats in the fountain!). A great book for everyone."
5,Great Book!,"I bought this book for my 8mo daughter, so she can start learning about the traveling my husband and I have enjoyed doing, and hope to do with her in the future. Beautiful book, neat illustrations . . .an overall wonderful buy! I am very very happy with this book."
5,The Voice of Gentle Souls,"Rod McKuen's book ""Listen to the Warm"" was perhaps the first I found of his work and after having read many of the classics and falling madly in love with Emily Dickinson. Although Rod speaks with a modern voice, his is still the voice of all gentle souls who have spoken, sung and who even now speak the language of poetry. But it isn't simply a language, it is a way of seeing most are too rough and immature or too busy to slow down enough to understand or even attempt themselves. ""Listen to the Warm"" is a great entry into Rod McKuen's heart, but continue to the other works that read very much like a travelogue through the course of his sensitive and wonder-filled life. If we all could but love as genuinely and deeply and hungrily as such hearts."
4,a BOOK TO LAST A LIFETIME,"I've searched everywhere for this book. I had a copy back in the early 70's and loaned it out and never got it back. I did find that a library in Ft Myers has copies of Rod McKuen books, so I guess I'll have to visit the library next time I'm in Florida. Rod McKuen could use simple words to describe a raft of emotions and feelings."
4,Over-rated in its day; unjustly ignored now,"This book was in everywhere in the early 1970s -- in bookstore window and given as gifts to friends -- so it's difficult to believe it's not even in print today. Rod McKuen was a romantic, ""touchy-feely"" poet; he was someone you read in your early 20s and outgrew when the time came to buckle down to the more workday world of job and family. That said, these poems are not all puerile -- you can find some good lines in them if you look hard enough. ""Warm"" has decidedly grown cold, but it's time for a revival. I'd give him -- not only this book but his numerous others that appeared around the same few years -- a 4 for the mix: better than average, but if you're looking for poetry that sticks to your ribs a little longer, look elsewhere."
1,Listen to the smell,"During a night on the town, while seeing the midnight cowboys and getting more and more bent (that means old) my friends and I shared a few laughs over the poem ""A Cat Named Sloopy."" Someone in the back seat brought up the subject of bad poetry and a couple of us instantly thought of Rod McKuen. My girlfriend kept an old copy of ""Sloopy"" stashed in the glove box. I almost crashed her sedan as she read aloud the first lines of ""Sloopy"".McKuen's writing style, a strange combination of self love and bombast, mixed with bad grammar and awkward metaphors, will ever serve young poets as an example of how not to write free verse. I always chuckle when I hear the line ""my arms full of canned liver and love."" You say potato, and I'll say poetaster. Let's call the whole thing off."
1,sanitation of shears,"If one purchases two piece kitchen shears it's so you can clean them thoroughly, truely two piece.....these shears are constructed from several pieces, e.g. grips are separate pieces bonded to blades leaving cracks at juncture for collection of food debris and moisture"
2,Great item...at first.,"This is a great item...at first. But the handles are metal foil-coated plastic that slips off the blades eventually. Also the foil chips, leaving razor-sharp edges on the handles. We tossed ours after a couple years usage, I'm sorry to say."
2,Much weaker than usual effort,"I am a huge Heywood fan and was excited about the latest Woods Cop mystery. However, I was very disappointed with this novel. As others have mentioned there was a lot in the book that simply did not make sense. Also, it was hard to follow the plot since Heywood insisted in bringing in a cast of thousands who added very little to the story. Also, the ending was not satisfactory. It was as if the plot was not moving along but the page count was too high so Heywood used a Deus ex machina to end the story, still with little conclusion."
3,memories,"Although it took me through a place I know well, the UP, the story was difficlt for me to keep straight. I was able, finally, to get the characters straight in my head. I will, however, read more of the cops mysteries. Joe is a great writer. Thanks Joe"
3,Better than most,"A story that got away. The author tries to do too much. Dozens of characters. A plot that never satisfies. Relationships that are interesting, but not in this context. I read this book last of the first five. A great series, a less than great entry."
2,Grady Service Stud muffin??,"Simply too many words wasted on Grady Service's love life. If I wanted to read a love novel, I would read one of my wife Danielle Steele novels. The story premise is excellent but, the story line is wasted on Grady being a Stud."
4,Wide Open,"I love this era of Prince. He'd established himself as a brilliant musician prior to this release, and he'd not been very shy in doing so. On this one, though, he opened it up completely. This was one of the last really raw sounds from Prince before he got locked into restrictive contracts and such. Still, what a way to go."
5,His First Masterpiece!,"For You and Prince could not compare to his third album, the masterpiece Dirty Mind. Neither of those albums provided such a great showcase for Prince's musical talents. Best songs are Dirty Mind and When You Were Mine. Definitly worth buying, it will be right at home in your Prince collection."
4,Great!,"Prince's third LP Dirty Mind is one of the best albums I've heard that have come out in the early 80's. The sound is funky and lyrically it is one of the most sexual explicit albums I have ever heard. The music is really good and the songs are catchy. The LP is both raw yet funky and brilliant all at the same time his falsetto voice and carisma shines through his album. However many people have not heard of this album and I find it's time to let them know that this album is not to be overlooked. Prince is a genius who has managed to make over 20 albums in 20 years. Almost every album is either good, great or a masterpiece ( Take that Michael Jackson). Buy it now. You won't regret it."
4,turn of a decade,"I would say this was a great way to start out the 80's- a nice risque album complete with the ""dirty"" cover. This was never one of my favorite Prince albums yet it still had an amazing amount of playtime in my stereo. I like every song- my favorites are ""Do it All Night"" and ""Head"". However, I never appreciated ""Gotta Broken Heart Again"" until I heard him perform it recently. I have to admit I slept on this one- it's a fine piece of work that defined the sincere sexuality and talent to expect from a star in the making. If you want to dig into the past for music that opened the doors to a new sound of funk, pick up ""Dirty Mind"""
3,Great Album,"I only gave this album 3 stars because I know he has better work out there. Although he has hits like ""Dirty Mind"" and ""Uptown"" no song really stands out to grab me. Then there is ""When You Were Mine"", but even that song hasn't grabbed me yet. Overall, this is one of the few albums that works well being played as a whole, but other than that, nothing here excites me."
3,Prince...Dirty Mind...,"This was another of the re-mastered Prince albums that I bought for ($7US). The signature song on this disc: Head! Overall though, it was my least favorite albums due to his subject matter. Let's be frank, he left nothing out on this one, and set a standard for all others to follow. Three stars!!"
5,Great classic Prince.,"Before he started getting all, uh, serious about things, Prince offered this great funk/rock masterpiece from '79 that sounded like nothing else at the time. The title tune alone is worth the download price. This is a great album."
2,"Sounds great, but big skipping issue.","Just wondering if anyone else is having this problem? My first copy skipped a lot on side two. Amazon just sent me a replacement disc and this one skips as well. My player and needle are fine and working well on other discs, including other 180 gram vinyl. I just wanted to see if this is a common issue from others who have purchased this disc. It's a bummer because the new remastering sounds terrific otherwise. It's the best I've ever heard Dirty Mind sound."
5,"Raw, unrelenting funk!","Unfortunately, since Prince's name change, his ""weirdness"" has overshadowed his music. That is a real shame, because he has released some of the most incredible music of the past thirty years!Dirty Mind is probably my all time favorite Prince album. It still has all of the bite that it did when it was released 20 years ago. Time has not diminished it one bit! The music here breaks down barriers. For example, When You Were Mine combines Funk, New Wave, and The Beatles. The lyrics are definitely not for the faint of heart. But, if you like music that gets in your face and takes chances, look no farther!"
3,Little Ditties From the 80s,"This is one of Prince's earlier CDs, of which I am not such a great fan. Don't get me wrong it's still good music, but a very short CD, just over thirty minutes. And the songs here don't have a whole lot to them, you know, crazy guitars and other instruments that the current Prince is famous for. The lyrics are interesting enough, I guess.If you are a fan of the early 80s material, a big Price fan, or maybe a music historian looking to discover where music started getting lowdown and dirty, then go for this album. Otherwise, go for the later Prince stuff."
5,"This is the best of the ""pre-Purple Rain era"" Prince","To be honest, I love all types of music, and I must admit, I am heavily infulenced by 70's and 80's music. With that said, this album is a must if you want to hear a truly unique sound from that era. This is THE album. Raw guitars, funky synth lines, driving drum and bass. Top it off with soulful wailing in a falsetto no less.(Uptown) is an antiwar party anthem. (Head, Sister)...set new standards in pop pushing the limits of censorship, but worth it. (When Were Mine)- very hearfelt and spunky. (Dirty Mind) simple, but infectious. If I had to choose 10 recordings to have on a desert island this would be one of them!Nuff Said'Thad"
5,prince's first great album,"This album is not Prince, or at least not the Prince we know. This album is more like Tracy Sanders with a dash of the Sex Pistols and Rick James thrown in to boot. Possibly his most cohesive, centered album, it is also his most erotic and taboo breaking. Try turning out jams about oral sex and incest today. only prince could have woven this magic. And magic it is. Buy this CD, pop it in your dash, and drive at 100mph until it ends. Overlooked, underrated (except by critics) and still for the most part undiscovered. Enjoy."
5,No-Ad provides great coverage,"As a scuba diver, No-Ad Sunblock 45 provides me with protection from sun rays without being greasy. I love it and must use it all the time, even though I have dark skin."
5,A great product.,"NO-AD products sell themselves on not bothering to advertise a good product, they sell on the word of mouth that the products are as good as any other sun/skin care, which smell good, soak into skin well, don't stain clothing and work well doing exactly what they claim to do on the bottle.Incidently the bottle's are basic with simple pump action dispensers and are made from easily recylable hard plastics.The fact that there is no hype, no nonsense and no false claim along with no attempt to waste money on hype, seem to have served this company well and has worked better than any glossy ads of perfect bronzed bodies from piz buin or ambre solaire, fair play to them! They are far more honest than any other skin care company I can think of!"
5,Old favorite,We use to use No-Ad in Colorado.Unable to find now in TX in locals stores. Thank goodness it is at Amazon! Love this sunblock for years.
3,Romantic Writing.,"Well Written, detailed, told with a little tongue in cheek empathy for the various peoples that were called barbarians. Yet,the author at times seems to ridicule the very authors he so often quotes. Since the barbarians did'nt choose to write their own histories, does not mean that their enemies who they attacked were lying in their descriptions."" Indeed, numerous archaeological finds far often than not prove the Classical records to be true."" Most scholars use to snicker at the very idea that the Amazons existed, they were proven wrong!"
5,Great music !,"Morricone is brilliant and inventive, and he was not affraid to try new things. This music is intuitive and emotional, inspirational and plenty of images.The audio quality from this recording is ideal for vaccum tubes, because, in spite of the typical saturation present in old recordings, the imaging is simply amazing. This is a must have for anyone interested in Morricone's music."
4,"""There's two kinds of people in this world..........",".......those with a gun, and those who dig. You dig"". Ya know, there's not too many soundtracks out there that make you feel like you're in the film when you listen to it. However, when I listen to ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"", I feel like I have a cigar in my mouth, a revolver on my hip, and a serious squint. The music is so incredibly perfect for every scene. Simple at times, and dramatic when it needs to be. This expanded edition is also nice because it's remastered, and has nearly twice as many tracks as the original. Don't be tempted by an album full of cover versions of this, or music from another film. This is the real deal right here. I only subtract a star for the lack of dialogue. A little bit of Blondie or Tuco between tracks would have been perfect."
1,Go With The Import.,"Get the import ""Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo"", by GDM. The sound quality is ten fold better. The expanded version does not do Morricone's talent any justice. And it still has the abridged version of ""The Trio"".A bit off topic, I found the same problem with Ikura Ifukube. Again a brilliant composer (known for Godzilla), again short changed by American released CD's. Always go for the import it seems."
3,"Not Bad, but not the Good one","This is a great soundtrack, but with this release you're missing much of it, and some songs are shortened. Get the real thing: Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo [IMPORT] ASIN: B0006ICFJA."
5,Excellent theme setter,"This album is a perfect theme setter for many occasions. Great background music for western BBQ parties, or just to have on in background. Areally good representation of the old spaghetti western style of movies."
3,Great CD but...,"Great CD but there should be more. Listening to the soundtrack, I found there was something missing. Especially on the last track Il Triello which should be about three minutes longer. Now if you can get your hands on a copy of the Extended Italian release of this soundtrack, you will NOT be dissapointed. Still, a great buy at a great price. Amazon should really be selling the expanded italian release since it is the definitive collection - Highly enjoyable Ennio Morricone. Takes you back to the great experience you had watching the film...Ciao!"
5,the good the bad and thr ugly soundtrack,this is an excellent representation of the music that should accompany a western of this caliber. ernnio morricone is masterful at creating the exact right mood with his compositions. i will quite likely be purchasing more of his work in the near future.
5,Marvelous expaned soundtrack.,"Title says it all! I have the original, shorter, release on vinyl and was looking to get it on CD. This expanded version is great. Would recommend it for anyone who is a fan of G.B.U."
4,Soundtrack score,"This soundtrack is very good and quite easy to loose yourself while listening. The track listing is in order with the film which makes it easy to follow. Ennio Morricone did a superb job on this score from the opening theme to the final showdown it is all here along with some bonus tracks. The only thing this disc lacks, as mentioned by another reviewer, is that there could be some dialouge between tracks."
1,Not what I expected,"This item is the June 1965 edition of the Reader's Digest. I was billed as containing the Book Section ""Beyond Fame and Fortune"" by Lawrence Elliot. But, when it arrived, the magazine did not contain this story after all. I did some research and found that the story is actually in the May 1965 edition. I have contacted the seller with no reply.Rgds, David"
3,Much too difficult for children...and some adults,"This toy was given as a birthday present for my 9 year old son.It has some faults. First, it is very difficult to set up, especially if you try one of the wacky setups on the instruction page. Second, we have never gotten past more than 3 turns before the whole thing collapses. Maybe we are doing it wrong but we don't have this problem with original Jenga.The good thing is that my younger children LOVE to use the pieces as building blocks and can make some pretty cool structures.I think the original should not have been messed with but may be just the challenge someone is after and as building blocks it is rather cool."
1,THE ORIGINAL IS MUCH BETTER,MY STUDENTS WERE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT PLAYING THIS GAME. IT TAKES FOREVER TO SET UP AND THE PIECES ARE VERY SLIPPERY. YOU NEVER GET PAST A COUPLE OF STEPS. IT JUST ISN'T VERY MUCH FUN TO PLAY. DEFINITELY BUY THE ORIGINAL JENGA. THIS ONE NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD.
2,not for kids,"wayyyyy tooo hard to play, takes forever just to build it back up because of its shape and the extra oil coat that they put on the pieces"
3,fun but hard work,"The Jenga game is a lot of fun. But the only problem with the Extreme game is it takes to long to set it up, the children got tired of waiting between games. However the blocks in the Extreme game made great building blocks."
4,how extreme can pieces of wood be?,"A lot more funt han the original, i'd say for older 'children' - the pieces are a lot more slippery, and the leaning tower tricks you need to keep going are fun."
1,Not what I expected,"I suppose this is a good book as a resource guide but I should have read the description better. I was expecting it to be an informational book, not just a book listing resources."
4,Great book!,Has alot of avtivities to choose from and alot of fun and interesting ones! I would definetly recommend this book!
5,Cahill does it best,"TIM CAHILL is one of the best travel/adventure writers in the business. He writes with wisdom, insight, and a gentle spirit that accepts humanity in all of its many aspects without passing judgment. Add in his ever present humor and ability to see something slightly amusing in even dire circumstances, and you have a winner. Every time."
4,Got me envious.,"Made me feel - whats the point inhaving a white-collar job.Envy, fascination and lots of laughsmakes this book a great one.The rating would be better if the authorinterconnected the stories in some way.Its a bit repetetive in some parts,but still ... buy it!"
2,How can adventure writing be so dull?,"I found this book to be extremely boring - it jumped from topic to topic, from location to location, without any explanation of who, why, where etc., and no sense of ""leading into..."". I had just read Bill Bryson's books and found them most entertaining, but Tim Cahill, I just could not identify with. He's certainly had major adventures, but his style is just so unemotional, so factual i.e. I did this, went there, climbed that, drank that... but I just couldn't identify with him. No empathy or amusement whatsoever. I love adventure books but this one I just found very dull and unimaginitive."
4,"""Cahill has perfected the art of the short travel essay""","One of my favorites. Author of Pecked to Death By Ducks and A Wolverine is Eating My Leg, Cahill, a founder of Outside Magazine, has perfected the art of the short travel essay. There are man-eating sharks, dangerous cave diving, eating cheese in a yurt in Mongolia and all sorts of ridiculous first hand escapades all over the globe. He is brilliant and brilliantly funny. Perfect travel book to take along on a trip. If you want to learn how to write, read Cahill and pay close attention to his introductions and conclusions."
4,Real adventure writing with great comic relief,"Cahill's books were recommended to me for some time before I read one. I just couldn't imagine that 'humorous adventure writing' was something that would appeal to me. Wrong! What is great about Cahill's pieces is that the humor is strictly at his own expense and the adventure is real. Make no mistake, this guy can really write. For example, when he ruminates about what is in store for him on a proposed dive in shark infested waters, he conjures up images of terror that any of us can relate to and then takes us to laughter with his description of his own terrified reations - which wouldn't be funny if it was US and WE were going to face the killer sharks.These pieces are a real treat; a taste of a lifestyle that we can only dream of, and laughs that keep us from being too covetous of it. Cahill is an American original."
4,For the Vicarious Adventurer,"Cahill's writing is somewhat of an acquired taste. This is a compilation of outdoor stories which do not always seem self contained - some missing context, some missing closure. And they are not necessarily adventures in the conventional sense, as stories may focus on nature, archaeology, sociology, etc. While the book cannot be construed as an outdoor reference, there is good information (ex. ""wisdom"" of cave diving). Some stories hit the vicarious adventurer's sweet spot. The author is at his best in this book when relating his experience caving in Kentucky, engaging the reader with educational content (ex. barometric effect on air flow), spectacular descriptions(ex. lightening igniting bat guano), and hair raising suspense (ex. getting lost in a maze of passages). Not all of the stories held an equal level of interest for me, but they are short enough to peruse and ponder as time permits."
4,Paper Fasteners,"They are a good idea and I like the concept. They aren't quite long enough. When fastening a thick stack of papers, they need to be a little longer in order. They do work though. The length just makes them a little harder to use."
5,Service Handbook,"I have seen Steve at several conferences. He is not only a great speaker, but a great author as well!! This is a must read for all business people."
4,Sanders Disects the Manson Cult,"If you want to get down to the nitty gritty of what made the Manson Family tick, this is the best source to date. Sanders was able to speak with many people who would never have been so open with Bugliosi or his associates. Read this book for more of an inside perspective than can be had from Helter Skelter.One caveat is it helps to already have at least a passing familiarity with the hipster lingo and historical background of the time during which the book was written. L7 folks might want to read up on the history of hippie era first as background."
1,I can't believe someone would publish this book,"Author Ed Sanders cannot write to begin with. Making sound effects is another annoying matter. I guess he wrote this book like he is talking to someone. But, speaking and writing is really a different matter. I don't know if his facts are all correct but reading through this book is difficult because the auther cannot, I repeat, cannot write. I first thought maybe Sanders is a foreigner, but I think what he really needs is to go back to grammer school."
3,The Family,The Family is more of a book that tells you about the life of Charles and his family. It really doesn't tell about the murders that he had commited. It tells about his childhood and why he was in jail all of the times. The book tells about why he had started a clan and what kind of people had to be in it. If you like to read about Charles Manson then this is a good book to read about his life. I thought that the book was pretty good. It really didn't tell about the murders that he commited but it did tell about his life.
2,Two stars for effort,"Sanders seemed to have had good intentions when he wrote this book, but halfway through his effort he seems to have had the sudden idea to instead begin regurgitating Bugliosi's book, thus rendering the entire work useless for those interested in learning more about the case."
1,Plug Plug Plug,"Although I am a ""fan"" of this subject (and I don't think it is appropriate to term it that way) I found this book to be a collection of facts and stories from those who know and a huge way for the author to plug his own projects. If I had to read about his damn record (which he names several times in the book with very loose ties to the actual story ) I was going to throw it against the wall. I do not think I learned anything that was not covered in ""Helter Skelter"" and the authors use of slang was, in my opinion, a pathetic attempt at being cool.Dissapointed."
1,Not all songs listed in preview are on cd - Misrepresented,I have to say I was very disappointed when I received the cd. I bought it because I wanted one particular song called Permission to Shine. It is shown in the preview and I listened to the clip to confirm it was the song. Yet when I received the cd the song is not on it. I feel it was not accurately represented. Either fix it or take it off the web site.
5,Great,"This is one of the best australian albums ever! Bachelor Girl have made a really catchy first album! The best ones are Treat Me Good, Lucky Me and Blown Away."
2,Low grade horror film,"This is a low grade horror film so bad it's entertaining. Last of the Paula the ape woman trilogy it's not as dull as ""Jungle Woman"" and not as mechanical or loaded with stock shots as is ""Captive Wild Woman"" One of my guilty pleasures."
4,rondo speaks!,"the jungle captive is to me a very entertaining movie,it is not highly thought of but it has rondo hatton which in my mind is worth the 64 minutes it runs.a sequel to jungle woman it is more fun than that one.good makeup job on the beast woman by jack pierce makeup genius at universal pictures,otto kruger,phil brown famous as luke skywalkers uncle in star wars,to bad its only out on vhs but worth the 8.99 I paid for it."
2,"Great memorabilia, poor quality","I am Otto Kruger's grand daughter, so I was thrilled to find the poster. Unfortunately it is a photo of the poster and shows the creases from folding. The quality is very poor. They did however deliver it in good shape and in a timely manner. I still love the poster because it has personal meaning."
3,Almost 5 stars...,"The content and format of this video are excellent for introducing the alphabet and phonics to very young children. It's short, to the point, and our 16 month old was captivated. She already knows most of the sounds the letters make and was chiming in with the children on the video.My only complaint is a big one! All of the children in the video have extremely pronounced southern accents! I've got nothing against the south. In fact, I was born and raised there. However, I think a teaching aid of this sort should feature children with a more generic dialect!"
5,carpenters gold greatest hits,CD was in great condition and I received it before expected.If you like the carpenters this is a great summary of their music.
3,Slowing Down,"I discovered Kitaro years ago in california. I was immediatley addicted to his music and have purchased many of his albums. I purchased Ancient and Ancient Joruney at the same time and was let down. What turned me on to his music was the style he used in his music. The soft and relaxing melodies inspired by world instruments and the exiting, epic performances that kept the listener begging for more. In Ancient and Ancient Journey, none of the songs really get going. A few songs build up to the point where you feel youre about to be swept away by the music and it will just fizzle out.They are good albums for relaxing, but none of the exitement is there."
1,Not Among His Best Work,"This tends to happen with Kitaro where he experiments a little too much. Ancient Journey does not grab me at all and contains a lot of annoying songs actually. There is very little to be gained here if you are a fan expecting more of his melodic, meditative compositions."
1,"Almost, but not quite there",This book comes up a little light in the facts department. You can only guess which period of time she is talking about at any given point as the author does not go into great detail about Status Quo or what they did/do/plan to do. It is really a typical book by a dumped ex-wife with all the customary bitterness attached. You end up not believing her as she loses her objectivity early on. At the end of the day she was married to an amazing musician in a band that is now an institution. Who cares about Parfitt's personal life. Tell us about the band. If you don't know anything about the band this won't help you. And if you are an expert this book won't help you either. But can someone tell us what Rick Parfitt does with all the money he makes? Perhaps the subject of his next wife's book?
4,Ogden's got history!,"I've lived here all my life, and I've heard rumors about some of this stuff, but today I actually got to see our sordid past. Isaac has done a nice job blending the pioneer, railroad and civic histories into one interesting story. He has several old pictures and even some eyewitnesses to help bring this story to his audience. Well done. Scott Smith"
5,Back from the dead even if for a moment!,"This is one great collection. Almost a story or scrapbook of sorts of that wild 70s outfit, Little Feat. Hear two versions of ""Teenage Nervous Breakdown"" side by side! Hear unreleased gems (""Framed"" and ""Gringo"")! Hear a New Orleansified ""Rock And Roll Doctor!"" Hear a touching tribute to Lowell George by Linda Rondstadt! Marvel at the chilling ""China White!"" And Roll on Through the Night while it ends... A must have!"
4,"A gem for fans of ""The Feat""","While probably not a good starting point for those who want to ""check out"" what Little Feat is all about, this is a great supplementary addition to Little Feat's catalogue of work with some interesting renditions of old favorites. Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
3,"Not the best Feat collection, but ok.","Not the best Little Feat collection, but the CD contains a fair assortment of oddities and a few actual album tracks. The best portions are the first few tunes, taken from late-era Lowell George concerts. The weakest material comes from the post-George period, where the group sounds utterly lost. In between, the set seems to miss the point of the band but does spend time on each album, mixing in live tracks with some studio material. The most revelatory cut is the group's version of ""Lonesome Whistle,"" a tune by Hank Williams. ""Hotcakes and Outtakes"" is better, because of its thoroughness. ""Hoy Hoy"" isn't the place to discover the true mystery of the band and is somewhat obtuse in the group's discography. Not really for newcomers or fans, it seems both overpriced and redundant in the 21st Century-especially in the wake of the box set."
3,"Not worth the price, esp of batteries","Candles are one of my passions, so I have to change air filters often from the smoke. Have allergies, so ordering battery operated ones more often. These are not as bright as normal tea lights and batteries are short lived and very expensive. Won't order again and only use for special occations, but don't expect much light."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Hours and hours is right for the length of duration. More than 2 hours, ha! I was excited to see these and went and purchased another package when my first came in. Flicker, they do, for HOURS and HOURS! Good Lord, I am such a huge Amazon shopper, over 500 items, and what disappoints me even more, is this came from Bethlehem Lighting, which has always been the very best of best when it comes to lighting decor. (In my opinion)Needs CR2025 3V batteries, so I suggest if you purchase these, buy many, many batteries, or hope your guests do not stay too long or they will think the ""flames"" went out and pull out a lighter to relight them all, then think you were cheap, just like these candles. Bethlehem, shame on you, Amazon, good try, me...bad. Only review ever in all these years. Do not buy, buy something else."
5,These speakers are awsome,"I brout home 3 different brand of speakers home. The bose 601 were far supperior. The sound was everwhere in the room, just as clear and crisp as any speaker I have other heard. Truely a work of art."
3,"so so, not reliable","My biggest complaint is that the glass is very flimsy, this broke in about a month and a half. I barely bumped it against a mug while doing the dishes and it broke into pieces. This device made a denser foam when it was not filled up to line, if I filled it up to the line the foam was too milky. Results varied each time and this did not give me a consistent dense foam. The foam also dissipated quickly once mixed into the coffee. btw I used 2% milk. will not be purchasing again."
2,UNim-PRESS-ed,"At first appearance it looks to be fine and even has a rubber plate that the glass fits into, securing it to almost any surface -- limits accidental carafe breakage maybe? then when I used it, I found things uncomfortable, not very USER-FRIENDLY -- and the frother to not be, well, not nearly as frothy -- very milky -- as compared to the Bodum, which by the way, changed their model style and was never the same. AS for the handle -- it's a knob on the top and difficult to get ones fingers under and around to secure for the pressing action needed. The Bodum, had a knob that was oval shaped and this worked better. The pressing screens are also cumbersome and frequently need to be completely dismantled for total cleaning. The flange is also a rigid plastic and metal now, while the Bodum's original was a flexible rubber and I think that helped make the frother, well, better. I'm yet to find one that compares to the original."
5,my wife really likes it,"my wife really like this frother. we recently bought 2 more- 1 for a gift and 1 to take to the office. easy to use, easy to clean, froths well."
2,BonJour Caffe Frother,"Very disappointed in this product. The glass cylinder broke after about two weeks of use. The frothing unit did not slide easily in the cylinder. This was my second frother. The first was a Black and Decker, which lasted several years. Now I need instructions on how to order another glass cylinder."
2,Glass breaks too easily,"This worked great for the first 3 days. On day 4 it tipped over on the counter and broke immediately. Glass is much too fragile. Am using a different glass container with the frother plunger, and it does work flawlessly, but the glass container it ships with is unnecessarily too thin and breakable."
5,A foamer that works,"This BonJour Caffé Froth foamer really works. It makes a thick froth that rests on top and holds together. Easy to clean if you do it right away. No need to heat milk. Very easy to use, quick.In comparison, the BonJour Primo Latte Milk Frother does not work so don't waste your money with that one."
4,Think of Tomorrow worth hearing,"This is an interesting collection of Irish folksongs and original material. Jacqui McShee's voice is haunting and light, making use of traditional Irish vocal ornaments. My personal favorite is ""The Lark in the Clear Air"", in which the group added an original verse. I had to stop at 4 stars because some of the original songs are trite and forgettable, but overall, this is a good listen."
5,Awesome,"Not only is Sidney the best, but this album is the best. One of the most prescious jazz albums in the 20th century!"
2,Made in China,"Elenco Electronics Inc. is based in Wheeling, IL, however, this power supply is made in China. It is written on the box ""Made in China"". Caution: All three plastic circuit board standoffs were broken when I received this product. Lucky I heard the pieces bouncing around inside the case before I plugged this device in or the circuit board would have shorted against the metal case. Had to install new standoffs before use. Also, when this device is turned off, the caps hold a steady 8V on the variable leads so be careful not to leave voltage sensitive devices connected while turning this thing off. Potentiometer to adjust the voltage on the variable side is not of good quality, so adjusting to accurate voltage is hard to accomplish. Overall I would say this thing is a piece of junk and is an actual hazard. I expected more out of a product claiming to be ""Made in the United States""."
1,Utter Disappointment,"This product arrived right on time when i really needed it, only when I went to use it the current was unstable and unreliable to work with. I then exchanged it the next chance I had. The new packaged arrived, right on time again, but the same results came to amaze me! Never again will I order this product, and as a first time user of Amazon, I was utterly disappointed."
4,BEAUTIFUL UNIT EASY TO USE,"THIS IS NOT THE UNIT I ORIGINALLY WANTED. HOWEVER, I AM VERY IMPRESSED!! THE UNIT IS SO QUIET !! IT HOLDS A LARGE CAPACITY, SO DINNER IS DONE FOR SEVERAL DAYS!! EASY, EASY, CLEANUP ! I HAVE FOLLOWED THE "" NO SALT "" RULE & SIMPLY SEASON WITH SALT AFTERWARDS IN ANOTHER PAN. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR VALUE & PRICE."
5,What an all-rounder!,I...The major advantage with this set is how easily you can use wither the glass lid or pressure cooker cover on either of the pots. The quality is the best I've seen in pressure cookers. The best thing about it is how easily it just slides to get locked unlike so many pressure cookers that are so furstrating to lock.With these two in your kitchen you will hardly find use of most of your other cookware.
3,"Beautiful, expensive choice","I used to cook with a pressure cooker that my mother had given me and I loved the time saved using it. Somehow in one of my many moves, it disappeared. After considerable research, I chose the Kuhn Rikon Duromatic Pressure Cooker Set. It is a beautiful set of pans that work very well. My only hesitation in recommending this purchase to someone else is the expense. I think the cooking results could be obtained with other pressure cookers. I must admit I was swayed by the brand reputation. The fact is that it is still just a pressure cooker underneath its beautiful looks. As long as you know that ahead of time, go ahead."
4,"Perfect, but pricey","I had not used a pressure cooker before so this was an experiment for me. So far I am thrilled. Risotto is now very easy and comes out perfect. Wild rice in 10 minutes puts it on our menu in place of the one time faster white rice. And making a lamb curry with a cheap cut of lamb was amazing. The frying pan pressure cooker was used for the curry. Pressure cooking a takes a little practice to find out what setting on your stove to use to get the different pressure levels. But after about four batches of rice I think I know all I need to know.I bought this pressure cooker because I had various Amazon coupons etc. It is more than twice as costly as others, and I am not sure that is justified. It is a beautiful flawless stainless steel piece of art. My aesthetic requirements were satisfied."
2,Not worth it,"I took care of the lid, etc and I'm in year 5. The handle to the small pan completely fell off and the small parts that broke on the lid aren't replaceable so a new lid's gonna cost me $99! The replacement parts are the problem. I've already spent alot of $ for a product that requires expensive replacement parts? I bought this for my Indian curries and beans but I find my enameled cast iron pot or cladware work just as well. If I'm going to pay that much for a pan, I need a lifetime guarantee or the product should be so sturdy to not need the support. I regret buying it and would not buy this again."
4,"A superb, memorable disc!","I've listened to Irish traditional music for a good many years, and it doesn't get much better than Portland. A wonderful, memorable blend of music and song. Kevin Burke's fiddling is in top-form, and the songs, in Irish gaelic, are hauntingly beautiful. I turn to this disc again and again and it always sounds fresh. My only complaint: There's not quite enough music - running time is 37 minutes and some change. Still, this is a superb disc, one I would strongly recommend."
2,pick songs off Itunes,"this 2 cd set did not live up to expectations, many average songs and missing a few of his better songs."
5,this book changed my life,"before reading this book my clothes were riddled with pubes and peppered with semen. my clothes would just sit in the corner of my room - abandoned I left them in this horrifying, tangled, sticky, mass of has-been t-shirts and seer sucker shorts. i was pathetic. i couldn't look at myself in the mirror. cotton shirts that i once loved felt like wool to my sensitive skin. i began to develop rashes and callused scaly skin. not only was by apartment a mess of pube harassed shirts but my skin was beginning to resemble scales. i turned to drugs and prostitution to try to get the pubes draped upon my body off my mind, but no. no one would buy sex from a pube ridden hooker. i found myself lost - wondering aimlessly through the city streets. but then, one day i had my awakening. betty, girl, this book has changed. my. life. i found it amongst old condoms and other useless things. now, i don't look like an animal when i put on a t-shirt. i am human again."
5,relax,"It's not a dream, a real mountain stream is in your bedroom, to relax and think of nature. The sound is perfect, so real and pure."
5,Chaos Indeed,"75 songs that surprisingly vary so much from one another. Celph just comes up with punchline after punchline and simply put, the dude is sick. The rubix cuban seems to be able to collab with ANYONE and always shine no matter who pops up on track with him and his solo tracks just give Celph more beat to spit his sick lines over. All in all, i can find no flaws in this collection of Celph's overall career. Anyone who's a fan of Celph or the Demigodz clique (or rap in general) should be ashamed if this isn't part of their collection..."
3,ALRIGHT?,"I LOVE REAL HIP-HOP!, This cd was alright but not that good..i seen the reviews and thought that i was geting some dope $hit.But what i got was four cd's with a combined total of four songs that i listen to. rhymes are not that good, there a 3 out of like 5 and a half.I will stick to my stuff, word up krumb snatcha, O.C. Words-worth, AZ,Can-i-Bus, Mighty Mithy MOS DEF, GANG-STAR. ECT........"
5,asdf,"i'm not going to write a massive long explanation of this cd, cuz if your checking this cd, you've already heard of, and heard celph titled on more than one occasion....all i have to say is this... your stUPID if you don't get it...peace,"
4,NOT BAD!,"i have to say when i first got this cd from a friend i was not too sure that i would like it, but after to listening to the whole cd i found that it was actually pretty good. the guitar-work is amazing and brett detar sounds a lot better on here than he does on the old zao stuff. the best song on here is constellation b/c the guitars just go all out. if u love great guitar playing or u like emo, i recommend that u check this cd out!"
5,A CD That Everyone Should Have,"This is an awesome Compact Disc. If you have the chance to get this CD, you should. The musical tunes are great. Brett is a really cool guy, and a great musician. All the members in this band make some great music together. The Juliana Theory's CD is one of the best compact discs to be released in a long time. They are an emo band I think. You should go and get your own copy today. Anyone who has any taste of music will like this CD. It is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,mediocre emo-pop.,"my friends had told me this CD was wonderful, awesome, changed their lives, etc. it did not impress me much at all. the whole time i was listening to it, i kept thinking that many, many local bands have CDs like this, yet THEY can't get a record deal. i've heard better from TJT. the only standout track was #6, ""The Closest Thing."""
5,good emo (punk) sound!,"The first song that caught my attention was ""August in Bethany""...talk about being EMOtional! Then I proceeded to buy the whole album, and I do not regret it at all! I love every song on the album, especially ""Music Box Superhero"" and ""Duane Joseph"". A lot of critics say their lyrics need developing (they repeat words a lot) but actually, I think it works well here since they'd have these irresistable loops I love. It hooks you. I was lucky to see them live. When they played an acoustic version of ""The Closest Thing"", I absolutely melted. This is great, for anyone who is into pop punk or emo, or even good (non-mainstream) modern rock."
5,Want to listen to a good cd?,If you do listen to The Juliana Theory! This band roX! I love every song...so good~!~ If you like these guys listen to Weston! --(another super-duper great band! )
2,Not their best... by a long shot.,"What made me a fan of this band originally were the catchy melodies in their songs. To put it simply: this cd doesn't have that quality. There are a couple songs that are good, but not enough to warrant buying the entire cd.I should point out that I became interested in this band after hearing their latest E.P. (which I bought) and then their latest L.P. (which I also bought). Both of those cds are excellent, but the earlier stuff of theirs that I've heard (this cd and some mp3s) just seem like they come from two different bands."
3,could be a lot better,"from the couple of songs that they do have, i know they could be a lot better. the only real reason why i don't like TJT that much is because of their lyrics. they repeat phrases....a lot. and it's annoying. esp the long pauses that have nothing and then it's like ""oooOOOoo..."" too much. from the Emo that is out there, their lyrics could be a lot better and composition could be better. it's mediocre. it's pretty mellow and on a bittersweet side which is pretty cool (it's Emo, what can i say). some good songs from THEM (not just this cd) are: ""Is patience still waiting"" ""if i told you this was killing me, would u stop"" and ""the closest thing"" they are just alright. i suggest Get Up Kids, Recess Theory, Reggie and the Full Effect, Appleseed Cast, Alkaline Trio, the anniversary, yellowcard, and Futher seems foreverKeyLain"
5,The ORIGINAL JULIANA THEORY FAN SITE - Webmaster,"I use to work with and book the members of this band (when they were with two other bands) at the Derry Theatre (a movie theatre converted to garage band concert hall). Lost touch with them for three years and then suddenly discovered that they were the Juliana Theory and were playing in Chicago. Totally blown away by them . . . they are a truly 'pro"" level act and this album totally nails what alt rock/pop/college rock should be.I know what these guys listen to so I can especially pick out the influences on the album but at the same time can truly say they are their own sound. Think of Radiohead meets Smashing Pumpkins with the hooks of The Goo Goo Dolls/Matchbox 20."
1,i hate these guys,these guys are MEAN and UGLY and STUPID and i have the same pants as them and im a girl!!!!!!!!!
4,Romantic - Karyn White,"US CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""ROMANTIC"" - KARYN WHITE1) Moonlight Edit - 3:522) Sexy Mix - 3:583) Candlelight Mix - 7:314) Instrumental - 3:415) Moonlight Mix - 7:226) Sensuous Mix - 7:077) Single Mix - 4:061991"
5,Great find,"I'm a big Karyn White fan, so it was nice to know that I could get this CD without getting it on ebay. Ebay=hotmess. Anyway, this CD is used, a little wear on the outside, but what do you expect the single is 21 years old almost. I love the remixes,and just got them so I could rip them to my ipod. Great job, next time I will order expedited shipping, normal shipping takes to long. No worries though."
3,"Different, entertaining, has promise","The plus side is that it isn't a first-person shooter. The minus side is that after a while it feels like ""Doctor"" (the Hasbro game with the cartoon body and the buzzers) spiced up with quicktime mini-movies.As a rapidly rising doctor in a busy emergency room you interact with a photo-real patient within the context of Exam Room, Lab, Imaging, and Treatment. As you apply the tools (EKG, and stethoscope, x-ray and blood workup, oxygen and I.V...) to the appropriate body parts, and make the correct entries in your chart, your score rises. At various junctures actor-portrayed characters (the crusty Chief of Staff, the caring young Intern), will speak to you and perhaps share a little of their own story."
4,I wish that they were more specific about the operating system.,"I remember playing this game when my father got it for his computer. It was a lot of fun, so when I saw it on Amazon, I wanted to get it for myself. The description said it was good for Windows, so I ordered it. What I did not realized was Windows and Windows 7 was not the same thing. Amazon told me that I could return it, so I did. It is a challenging game, but remember, it is old and quite expensive. Be careful to check out the operating systems that the software is able to run with. I learned the hard way."
1,Emergency Room is Dumb!,"Too bad we can't try these things out before we buy them! This ""game"" is limited in scope and, after the third crash, I gave up on it. Give me The Sims any day!"
5,oranges and oratory,"I came to this book knowing nothing, I walked away an erudite robespierriste. Jordan has written a clear, acessable history without being condescending. Although most of his interest is with Robespierre's politics and beliefs (plus an excellent chapter on his oratory), Jordan has a gift for including just enough personal information abou the Seagreen to make him seem at least somewhat human (for example: his obsessive love of oranges). I thoughroughly recomend it."
3,Does not fit all 14x6.5 snares,"I have a mapex Black Panther 14x6.5 steel snare and this case is a touch too short to accommodate the snare throw. This can result in unnecessary impact to an already delicate part of the snare and cause damage in the long run. Unfortunately Protection Racket does not make a 14x7 case so you have to decide whether to try the 15x7 or the 14x8, either of which will have too much extra space."
2,Good human interest material; some extremely poor research,"Though the subtitle indicates this book deals with the aircraft carrier Yorktown at the Battle of Midway, it actually follows CV-5's career from late 1941 through its sinking in June 1942. The author provides depth and variety to his human interest coverage but makes a large number of egregious factual errors, all of which are avoidable. Just a few corrections: some US torpedo planes DID return to their carriers; Geo. Gay of VT-8 did NOT receive the Medal of Honor; SBD and TBD armament is incorrectly described; and for some vague reason the Yorktown dive bombing attack that sank the Japanese carrier Soryu is glossed over in one short paragraph. This is certainly a worthy topic, but the best books on the subject are Cressman's ""That Gallant Ship"" plus Cressman (et al) ""A Glorious Page in Our History."" Naval aviation history really needs to be written by naval or aviation people."
2,Really dissapointed with the transaction,"They were suppossed to send me a 4 pc crib bedding set and I only got 3 pieces, its been so frustrating to get the missing piece that I lost a lot of time and phone calls trying to, and never got it. Neither amazon or the seller were able to solve my problem, the solution was to return it, buy another one and keep the part I needed or send me something similar, the bedding set is really nice but the transaction was the worst of my life!"
2,"Great while it lasts, but dies before it should.","I thought this would be a quality, long lasting opener. The one I had before it was similar, but the knob to operate it broke off. This lookedstronger to me. It worked great for a couple of years, but then wouldn't open anything. I'm a disabled senior with neuropathy, and have a hard timewith my hands/fingers. I contacted the manufacturer about my problems withthis opener, and they wouldn't even respond to me. For the price, this product should last much longer."
1,Roller Hardness Problem,"I was originally delighted with this opener. I like safety openers and my last one, a Swiss-made one, lasted a dozen years. This opener worked very well for the first several weeks, but the cutting edge wore down to the point of uselessness after only 3 months. The cutting wheel is made of a softer steel than is needed for long-term use. Older versions may not have had this problem. This opener is now made in China."
4,Good product,"This Kuhn Rikon Auto Deluxe Safety LidLifter seems well built. It does take a little getting used to but once you've got the hang of it, it's a great product!Would recommend"
2,Great then failed...,"This opener worked fantastic the first couple of months. One round and the can was open.BUT as time went on, it got weaker and weaker, and I'm only talking 4 months from the date I first bought it. Now it takes 2-3 rounds before it does the job.Sadly would not recommend buying it."
2,heavy cans and top crank awkward,"Works well on smaller cans (tuna, soup, etc.), but when used on a large heavy crush tomato can, the can dropped off the opener about halfway through opening. Luckily the can was just a few inches from the counter and no major spill. Could not open that can completely after re-tries and had to bend the top with pliers. Tried another large crush tomato can but with that one I kept the can on the counter while cranking so it wouldn't drop off the opener. It made it all the way around with a clean cut but was a little awkward. Another awkward thing, even with small cans, the crank is on the top instead of the side. Kind of have to lift your elbow while cranking. Side crank would be more comfortable, don't have to lift elbow. The opener is well made, nothing flimsy about it and Im sure will last a long time. Just the design and performance is least to be desired. I recommend buying one with a side crank."
1,Kuhn Rikon can opener,This is the worst can opener I have ever owned. It rarely cuts and when it does is totally frustrating to get the lid off! Buyer beware.
1,Safety Concerns,"After reading the reviews for this can opener, I thought I would give it a try. In concept it sounds awesome. No hassle with jagged edges, etc. However after 3 uses, I found that it began to leave slivers of metal around the edges. Some of which actually found their way into the food.This seemed especially bad on small cans of soup.While I had high hopes for this product, I cannot recommend it due to concerns for safety. My can opener will be returned to the manufacturer."
5,excellent,"Kind of expensive, but an excellent product. Have had it for months now as our sole can opener. With our very small house counter or cabinet space is too valuable for a plug in appliance, but after many poor quality openers we were considering buying an electric. This is so easy to use there is no excuse for plugging one in, if you lift a can you can turn this opener. My wife is very happy with the sanitary nature too."
5,"The Very BEST, Period!","There are far less expensive can openers out there but none better. A great functioning unit, it's built like a Swiss watch. I bought one for myself and 2 to give as Christmas gifts."
4,"So far, So good","I've had this for over a year, use it quite regularly, and haven't noticed any drop in performance. My only quarrel is that the pincher used to open the lid is on the opposite side of the opener(I am right handed). It is a slight inconvenience to have to look to grab the lid. I know, it's not that big of deal. It works great. I've had no problems."
4,Lid Lifter Lifts Off,"When we first got this unique tool, my son and I thought it was defective. The mechanism glides so smoothly around cans, it hardly seems to be doing anything...then we discovered the grip that lifts the lid off. I truly like the safety the lid lifter provides. Since we recycle our cans, sharp edges can really be a hazard; but we no longer have that problem. The lids even fit back on as though they had never been removed. This product is very well constructed, has an easy grip to turn (much more comfortable and easier to operate than a standard can opener), and seems to stay cleaner. The only drawback is opening large cans, particularly large cans of coffee."
2,very hard to turn,"I've had other openers that function the same way (side opening, no sharp edges) and this one does the job perfectly well, but it is not as easy to turn as the others I've used. For older folks or those with arthritis, I don't think it would be a great choice. In fact I often opt for the old cheap grocery store version in my drawer rather than use this one. My older parents can't use it at all."
4,It works,"It works as described. I like it a lot, my wife says its Ok but she thinks its a little hard to use."
3,Only 1 yr old and starting to fail,"I did lots of research and put my faith in this expensive product, but it's only 1 yr old and already failing to open on first cutting round.I gave one to my sister too, and hers is doing fine still, so maybe I got the lemon!"
5,In love with this tool,"After falling head over heels in love with the Kuhn Rikon garlic press several months ago, I was confident enough in the company's quality and design genius to give up my Krups electric can opener for this little beauty. Is it possible to get excited about opening a can? Yes, when just a few smooth clockwise turns of the handle, and one counterclockwise turn to release, yields a can that opens without splashing, without creating a sharp edge, and with no food residue ever touching the can opener gears to accumulate gunk. The lid comes off smoothly and cleanly and, if you aren't planning to use all the contents (such as a large can of Italian plum tomatoes), the lid does fit snugly back on for refrigerator storage without having to transfer to another vessel."
3,I bought this game before the insane price i jusr saw.,I bought this game a few years ago and it was a fun game with the regular price of 50.00 bucks back then. I would think by now it would be like 30 bucks or 19.95 like alot of games do after a while maybe but not the insane 80.00. I do not even know what thats about. other than that its a pretty fun game. its sort of like grand theft auto except with the limitations that you cant kill civilians and if you get into to much trouble by trying your basicly garenteed to get killed by the cops without a chance of survival. you can do and make customized things and buy businesses. you basicly start the game right at the final scene of the movie except this time you need to survive the attack on your mansion to start the rest of the game. then your starting from scratch and rebuilding your coke empire.
3,"Good for awhile, too repititive","Scarface is a good game for non-serious gamers, but if your buying for the long run, this game won't cut it. Although the missions are fun, they lack variety, and it is too repetitive. I also wouldn't reccomend this game for young teens because of it's strong drug content. Overall it's okay, but not a Grand Theft Auto beater."
4,"SHAME OF YOU VICE, CITY SHAME OF YOU..","i have to say that the universe of scarface is more than ten years old that the vice city rockstar theme, and all of story, scenes and world was entirely ripoff of this classic. inclusively the original soundtrack was included in gta 3 in the flashback radio station. then who steal who?. this game is fantastic and full of fun, and is way better than recently over hyped games like Just cause."
2,Don't expect much for your money.,This game for the most part is a blatant ripoff of grand theft auto.The graphics are not that good & the missions you must complete are sometimes really boring or just plain confusing. If you want a real street action game try the latest GRAND THEFT AUTO. If you can pick up this scarface game for under $10.00 it's worth it. Otherwise don't expect much for your money.
5,Should cost more...no...really,"I waited until I used this product for 32 years before I would leave a comment. Well the 32 years of testing this product on my face everyday [ 11,680 days, but who's counting ]..this product should only be used by men who shave and would rather not have a nice red rash on there face. This product cools the face, and about the smell being loved by women...well I have 4 children...enough said...just buy it...the end"
3,Too expensive,I bought this for my grandfather not knowing the actual price they retail for. Which is only $5 when I paid $8+. Other than though it cam in a plastic bottle and is exactly what it looks like. I give it 3 stars because of the price.
5,GREAT,This book is a must read if you haven't. Frankl writes of his life and Logotherapy. Great price for hard copy.
4,On Frankl and life,"Dr. Viktor Frankl weaves the story of his concentration camp experiences in a masterful look into the soul of man. The first section of this book is his recounting of his experiences. The later sections delve into his concepts of logotherapy and psychoanalysis. While the later sections would have never been a topic of interest to me, provided with the backdrop of his camp experiences, I thought it provided an interesting peek into that area study. Well worth the read! Highly recommend for anyone searching for life's purposes and explanations."
4,They must have died in 1969.,"Because that is where the heart of their music remains. I must be one of the only people who bought this CD the day it came out, but since I popped it into my car stereo, I haven't been more pleased in a new rock group in a long time. The arrangements, the melodies, the style, all harken back to the day when ""album rock"" was a mainstay and there was more to a song than just a few choruses and a bridge.If you enjoy classic rock bands like The Zombies, The Beatles, The Who, and current bands like Jet, The Vines, and The White Stripes... The Zutons are the latest chapter in the resurrection of good rock music.Someone may have killed the Zutons, but even in ""Death"", they are bringing rock back to life."
4,I killed them!,"great album, sort of like a 60' brit. invasion band gone crazy, with eccentric quarky lyrics, a saxphone, and a light hearted feel to it.but that isn't to say there aren't a few deep heartfelt songs on the album, it has that too!"
1,bad band bad music,Very disappointed by this band...nothing new..no good melody...It is a CD that everybody will forget quickly
4,...,"I cannot see the comparrisons to Franz Ferdinand at all. FF is good enough, but there isn't any FF in The Zutons. If I bought this cd because I heard they were like Franz, then I would be a very disappointed music purchaser.Hopefully that disappointment would be short-lived since this is a fairly strong album. The overall feel of the album is a mix of some swing influences and classic rock/pop, with a few songs going down a rockabilly/country route. Also interesting is the pseudo horror theme in the artwork, which gets alluded to occationally in the music, too.The strongest testament of this cd is how there are a lot of really good songs on here, yet the bad songs are still catchy as hell. They are bad songs I would definately have recommended they leave off... yet I still want to sing along with them.Not a bad effort and I would think that fans of older rock and swing will get a kick out of the album. I think (and hope) that future albums are stronger and pack more of a punch."
4,Really Good...check out The Coral,"First off, this is a really good album...quirky, ambitious, catchy and a whole lot of fun. Not to take anything away from The Zutons, but they sound almost EXACTLY like The Coral, who've been around for about 5 years. Anyone who likes this album will love The Coral's debut (which is self-titled). The Coral's second album (Magic & Medicine) is also good but pales in comparison to the first one. Check 'em out."
5,Epic Debut!,"I just saw these guys (and gal) on Aug. 2nd, 04. Man, what a live set. This is one of the few bands that is hard to place. They definately carry a vintage vibe. There are some classic rock sounds, there are some nice folky songs (but not traditional), there is a bit of Mo-town, a bit of ska and a splash of rockabilly! Now blend it up, shake it, and play it loud. If you are not infected by the songs, check your head, eh?This is the record that I hoped the band the Coral would follow up with, but they didn't.Buy this and enjoy introducing them to you buddies.ps...after the show (they opened or co/headlined) for Cosmic Rough riders) we were able to meet them and hang out for a while. Great people, great fun. Enjoy!"
4,Get the Zuton Fever,"So, who did kill the Zutons? I don't know because I think they're alive...and well, I might add. Thanks for asking. A lot of people are trying to compare The Zutons to other English bands such as Franz Ferdinand or such American bands as The Killers or Maroon 5, but I find them to be another animal entirely. When people attempt to categorize a band yet are unable to do so, it's a credit to their originality, not a lack thereof.Starting off with the oh-so-catchy track Zuton Fever, we are immediately immersed in the quirky and inimitable sound of The Zutons. From there, there exist many standout tracks that I thoroughly enjoy including the three videos that are included on the enhanced CD for your computer-viewing pleasure: the alt radio hit Pressure Point, the punkish You Will You Won't, and the fun quasi-country track Remember Me. Don't try to classify The Zutons, just enjoy them. Nice CD."
3,Prevention and Cure,"This selection is a collection of ideas and history that exists within the disease, Diabetes. It includes ways you can prevent Diabetes and its affects on people and summarizes the attempts to cure the disease in the past 10 years. I felt this book was an asset to the Diabetes Literature that I have read."
1,This is an ordinary book on web search.,I have disappointed when I have read this book. I could accessed more detailed information on Web.
3,"Paper is fine, backing cardboard flimsy, packaging terrible","The review title says it all, actually.The paper is fine. I accidentally ordered it with lines, and although I was initially disappointed, they turned out to be very helpful in writing straight and organized on such a big pad. The lines are pretty close to invisible to your audience, so go for the lines, is my advice.The backing cardboard to the pad is very flimsy, which is a disadvantage to such a heavy and large pad of paper, inadequately supporting the edges from getting dog-eared, etc.The mailing package was even flimsier and arrived filthy, torn up and ragged. Since one really does need to transport these pads in a protective cardboard cover, it is a major disadvantage that the packaging can't serve that purpose, as there is no other covering cardboard included."
1,do not put in dishwasher,"I placed these in the dishwasher and they came out broken and unsightly. After going back to check the description on Amazon, I see that the description says to hand wash only but on the actual product it did not say this."
3,a good second effort,a good album. The songs are more intelligent and the disc over all is polished.
5,sophomore hit,"To me, a bands sophomore album makes or break a band. Although this album is a bit more tame than Fever to Tell, I was instantly addicted to the tracks and I love this album."
2,Songs sound like they were each written in about 20 minutes...,"..this is what happens when hipster fashionista lead singer moves to Hollywood and the band has to fly there to meet her and write songs. Just goes to show that ""Maps"" was an anomolie, and that this band is exactly what most of it's haters have said all along: all style, very little substance. It's hard to be anything other than that with someone like Karen O as frontperson."
2,No No No!!!!,Ok. I have now lost my patience with this band. I bought the EP...not great. The first CD was boring and the live DVD was dismal. Crap. Simply because band members are extravagant and seem to have lots of personality does not a great band make.
1,What a dissapointment,"something rock is lacking in every era is bands that are actually fun. 98% of all rock music is boring and definately not fun. AC/DC, The Who, Rocket from the Crypt, Dead Boys, the Ramones, Hot Snakes, the Decendents, MC5, the Stooges, the runaways, the Pixies, Talking Heads, and so on... were the exceptions to the boring masses. Unfortunatly the Yeah Yeah Yeahs gave up this torch and decided to be arty and boring instead of arty and fun. Too bad, The Master EP was one of my favorite records a few years back and I even liked Fever to tell. Guess they were just another semi-punk band."
1,Yuck Yuck Yuck,"I hope who ever produced this album contracts Ebola. Although the disease itself kills too fast (thus there has never been a severe outbreak), knowing that their flesh will rot off their body will give me some comfort after enduring this trash. Every catchy hook from the 80's is tossed into the blender here and spit out without any type of imagination. Karen O's voice is so electronically manipulated it almost sounds like she can sing. There isn't one song on this disc that is memorable. God I hate it. AND, I love the YYY's (more specifically Karen O) and have seen them live a couple of times."
2,room for improvement,"The three tracks of interest here are Gold Lion, Cheated Hearts and Way Out. The rest is junk.Karen O uses the twang in her voice way too often. It would be more effective if she used it less."
5,"More mature,more complex and greater",Yes i admit i miss the Karen's screamings but i love the album.1.Gold Lion- Good drums great verse and strange single 10/102.Way Out-Excellent mini intro and great producing 10/103.Fancy-Complexxx for ever and fantastic b-singing 10/104.Phenomena-The best track which is more a fever to tell song 999/105.Honey Bear-You are not invited great song 10/106.Cheated Hearts-is the last screaming that makes it really good 9/107.Dudley-average song but it would be better without this song 5/108.Mysteries-scream to me O 9/109.Sweets-sweet ballad 9/1010.Warrior- one of the greatest ballads i've ever heard 999/1011.Turn Into-great closing song 9/10
2,a sad sorry disappointment,"this album is pretty terrible. it's so overproduced that it doesn't even sound like yyy's. it's completely boring. gone are the dirty angular guitar sounds, and all the best little shreiks, growls and moans of karen o that made me love this band in the first place. it honestly sounds like someone [...]the band. they sound bored and there is no passion. i'm truly deeply disappointed, having been on the yyy train since the first ep. this is rubbish. i hope they make alot of money."
1,SUCKS,"- The yeah yeah yeahs have made a piece of crap. It's all wimps with acoustic guitars, not the punkish feeling of fever to tell, dont waste your money, buy a stooges record."
5,Karen O is hawt,"This is an awesome cd, and I'm not going to bore you with a long review of how the first sound of the chord of the beat shifts and roars throughout the damn cd, just pick it up and listen to it. It's packed. I like it more than ""Fever To Tell"" But, you be the judge!"
5,Fantastic book!,"This is a fantastic book, one of the best I've read in ages. It's the story of John Pridmore who was a London gangster. His life was turned upside down after he nearly killed a man outside a bar. Today, he takes the Christian message into schools and prisons. A terriffic and inspiring story. It reminded me of The Cross and the Switchblade."
1,Not impressed!,"After reading the book myself, I would not send it to my son, who is presently incarcerated. Why? He knows enough about crime already, why would I want him to learn more. The conversion was not so believeable. Mr. Pridemore, is that how your conversion actually happened?"
3,"We got the wrong one, but Amazon did treat us well about it","Just a note to check that you actually get the Best Manufacturers 12 inch whisk (aka Balloon Whip) and not a different brand made in China. I'm not sure if it was just a mistake or what happened, but we specifically wanted a made in USA whisk by an American manufacturer. Amazon treated us fairly when we contacted them, but still, buyer be warned to check. We have ordered made in the US items on Amazon before and received the correct product."
5,Swordfish,"Three great movies in one case and all you have to do is get the popcorn ready, soda and candy to eat."
5,Perfection.,"I wish there were more bands like the Prids out there, making darkish music with an 80s vibe, but adding their own take on the whole thang. I highly recommend this cd, and both of their eps (available on their website I think). This is some of the best music I've heard all year!Long live the Prids."
2,Too sweet.,"These aren't Jolly Ranchers. If you're looking for something that tastes like Watermelon Jolly ranches, these aren't for you. they have a sickening oily sweet taste to them. Waaaay too sweet. Stick to the Halls Citrus instead."
1,"I've seen worse, but not by much","What is with the BBC and the blue background? Wire in the Blood, Dr. Who, etc all have this blue tint to their shows. I guess they can't afford but one set. Jekyll is not bad and worth a look while flipping channels. But the entire story is so cliched as to be painful. The worst part is the mysterious 'organization' and the mysterious secret. And ""Benjamin' is such a stupid over the top villain he's painful to watch. Though it was rather fun to watch him get his in the basement. Nothing new or interesting on the whole.There are some fun bits scattered throughout so, worth a watch on the Telly for free if there's nothing else on.Go watch Quatermass or Benny Hill. Or maybe Joe 90. Now that was a good show."
5,warning! you will be compelled to watch every episode... in one sitting!,"Brilliant!I just finished a marathon viewing of Jekyll on BBC america. I haven't been this excited about a TV show since the first season of Lost, or Battlestar Galactica. Stephan Moffat's (from coupling and the new Dr. Who) influence shines through. James Nesbitt is simply amazing."
5,Wonderful and Disturbing,"I saw this at a friend's house and went right out and bought myself a copy. Wow. Okay, double wow. This version of Jekyll and Hyde has completely convinced me the story can be scary and entrancing. I have seen other retellings of J&H;, but this is one of my favorites. Like the Joker in the latest version of Batman, this modern day Jekyll is realistically frightening and disturbing.Brilliant show. Wish there had been more of it. Don't watch it with the kids, whatever you do."
3,A Show With a Split Personality,"Jekyll begins with an intriguing premise and strong characters, but begins to almost confuse itself with its twists and faulty logic. What starts as a smart show for the first few episodes slowly slips into inconsistency, with each new plotline and story arc growing more ridiculous than the last. Serious and interesting characters conclude this show's single series as shadows of what they once were, resulting in a disappointing end to what could have been a brilliant display of storytelling.TL;DR: a mediocre episode of Doctor Who drawn out to 6 episodes. And this is coming from a Doctor Who fan."
2,yuck,"A friend recommended this Moffat show because I love Sherlock and Doctor Who, but I watched half of the first show and turned it off. i didn't like it at all."
4,James Nesbitt is truly creepy.,Jekyll is a show you have to watch. It's not a play in the background while cooking dinner type of show. Sit down and watch. It's worth it.
2,Good Idea Poorly Executed,"It was a great idea and it had an encouraging start. By the 4th episode it becomes very clear that the writer had lost his focus and it quickly declined into dramatics for the sake of dramatics. A major contribution to the weaknesses here is the unfortunate miscasting of the actress who plays Tom's wife. I have no idea who she is but her over-the-top emoting simply made her annoying and distracted from any entertainment value the show might offer. Plenty of unnecessary dialogue, assigned almost exclusively to the lesbian couple and a few loose ends make this a disappointment. Too bad. If you must see it, rent it."
1,Dreadfully stupid,"Steven Moffat is Britain's foremost purveyor of adolescent cr*p and wastes more potentially good material than any director on the face of the planet. I find it hard to believe that so many people liked this - it' s pointless, the plot ""twists"" are arbitrary and there's absolutely no attempt to explain any of the ""science"" behind any of it, just a bunch of adolescent notions about the eternal nature of true love. Like all of Moffat's stuff, a total waste of time...think ""Torchwood"" but even sillier. Nesbitt it totally wasted on the lousy script, for which he attempts to overcompensate with the hammiest acting imaginable. Awful."
5,Brilliant,"Another delicious series from Stephen Moffat, who also whisked Doctor Who and Sherlock Holmes into the 21st century through his inventive writing. (I can always tell when I'm watching a something with the Moffat touch -- it's effortlessly smart and surprising, and makes everything else on TV seem even more leaden and formulaic.)And James Nesbitt is amazing as Tom Jackman, the modern-day descendant of Dr. Jekyll, who suffers from the same malady."
4,An excellent 21st century take...so far..,"I just saw the first episode and was very impressed. Steven Moffat (Dr. Who) has come up with an interesting take on the old story. Lots of mysteries are set up in the episode which will hopefully be resolved in the next 5 weeks.James Nesbitt makes an excellent Jackman and Hyde. It's implied in the first episode that he is a descendant of Dr. Jekyll but no one knows quite how. I'm sure this will be looked into in the coming episodes. The evil side is called Hyde as a joke-which he doesn't get. There is a subtle physical difference between the two-something I don't think every actor could pull off. I'm glad they didn't go for the stereotypical 'ape-man' look although there were a few quick glimpses of a more animalistic Hyde. An excellent series, can't wait for the DVD."
1,worst description,Ordered this item and it states that the item is 48 inches. It is the smallest reindeer I have ever seen my 2yr old is bigger than it. When it arrived it is in a box labeled 36 inches. Will never buy another product from this company.
5,Classic design and beautiful Great for any yard,THis is a very good display. We love it. Classicdesign and beautiful great for any yard like the idea for the support that went into the ground
5,A Must-Have,This cable is a must-have if you need to use the Metra kit for after market installation. It fits perfectly. I installed a new CD receiver on my 2003 Honda Accord and this antenna extension fitted well in terms of length and plug-in. It's worth every dime.
4,Does what its supposed to do.,"Very straight forward. Does what it's supposed to do. When I installed my car radio, my antenna wire would not reach the R side of the radio where the antenna input was. I purchased this extender and whala! Works like a champ."
3,Mr Manuva is Master!,"Rae and Christian are often credited as displaying that British Hip-Hop is around and sounds good. But as dj's/producers they have SFA to do with it's renewed respect I feel. Because Roots Manuva and dj's such as Leftfield have had the most to say. With the long awaited follow up to Leftism, Leftfield feature Roots on thier newest album. And in 'Phat Planet' he does a grand job too. However when I brought his debut long player; Brand New Second Hand' I was blown away.Not being a hip-hop fiend or anything of that description, I immediately took to Roots' disjointed breaks and chopped-up beats. Respect double big time must also go out to Mr Manuva for refraining from employing a US accent - while only a minor effort, it serves his talent well. And finally, I was drawn in by his political bend, ""the IMF wont write-off the third world debt, 'cause they profit from holding it down"". Mr Manuva is the Master!"
4,Smooth but powerful,fascinating and vital lyrical content delivered more naturally than any hip hop artist I know.
4,sweet band,"i just happened to see them on a trip to dallas and they rocked. I agree that you can't capture their energy and performance on a cd, but it is still a great addition to any metalhead's collection"
4,Hail Texas!!!,"A pretty good album overall with loud guitars (and synth), and even louder on stage antics. All hail Texas, thanks for the great industrial bands."
3,3 films on one-sided disc?,"Since all films are shoehorned onto one side of the disc, there is no room for at all for extras, scene selection, or even picture quality. When it loads, you choose which film you want to watch and there you go. Gorky Park picture quality is godawful, but Needle isn't terribly bad. I doubt I'll ever watch the third film. For the price it's great to have Eye of the Needle at all"
2,Only wanted the one...,"OMG - Love the movie Eye of the Needle which is why I bought this set. Gorky Park is one of the worst movies I have EVER seen. If you can find Eye of the Needle just by itself, buy it. Then you won't be tempted to watch the others that come in the set. You will never get those two hours of your life back!"
5,duct fan,we purchased this item to help with our radon problem and it worked great our radon went from an 8 to a .6 so we are very pleased. It is very quiet and was easy to hook up.
1,Buy better American products,"This is a German product. You expect high quality. You will receive extremely poor quality. When we opend the box, the screws to fix the motor inside of the body, came apart separately. Better buy true American products, manufactured here in the US. Yepp."
5,Occasional Reviewer,"1. Very well designed and made. It warms up fast as all cookware with 3-ply bottom. Mirror finish let it stay hot for a long time and use very low level of burner to keep pressure. Pressure valve doesn't release smells and quite silent.2. Cooking under pressure saves me in average 50% of time.3. Overprized, but wait for a good sale.-------------------------------------------After 4 years of very light usage and hand washing the UL aluminum valve (part #1565) corroded and broke apart. Luckily it was not under pressure. What was in Kuhn Rikon's engineers heads to put aluminum part with a steel spring in wet environment ?! The new one cost 20$. Fun to repair - priceless."
2,Premium product requires premium maintenance,"I relied on this pressure cooker to prepare most of my food for years, but around year 5 the handle began to fall off as an internal plastic component wore out. The handle can be replaced, but like the silicone valve I also needed to replace, it is only available from a couple of small specialty retailers at a high price. I've had other pots whose handles came loose, but that was decades after they were purchased for less than $10. Kuhn Rikon's pressure cooker design might outclass its inept competitors, but its construction quality is nothing special."
5,"Yes, it is as good as they say.",Very well made and very obviously well thought out and designed. This greatly expands the range of foods that you can cookand cook them better.
5,Owned since Dec 17 2002,"We just now have had to order a replacement over-pressure valve and new sealing ring. This pressure cooker has been used on average 5-7 times a month for the entire time we have owned it. In the last year we have started purchasing all of our staples in bulk and have been using the pressure cooker 5-10 times a week. Some days it will cook Irish oats for breakfast, Rice for lunch and quick soak beans for dinner. The best thing about all of this is for all of those meals the pressure cooker allows us to have the stove on for less than 5-7 minuets. Not only has this product lasted for so long but in the last year it has saved several times it's cost in propane and in the convenience of preparing good foods from scratch in the same or less time than prepared, packaged foods."
2,"After 4 Years, Lid broke!","The pressure cooker cooks very well and is whisper quiet. My complaint? For $178.00 I would expect a pressure cooker to last longer than 4 years of minimal usage! I didn't use it every day. I used it once in awhile and the other day I took it out of my cabinet and the metal disc going around the pressure indicator had fallen off and the plastic was cracked! I'm really annoyed! The company is oh, in SWITZERLAND?! how does one get it fixed? I won't be buying another one again. I'll stick with the US from now on."
4,Hasn't blown up yet,"I bought this as a gift for my chef husband who begged for a year. He tempted me with stories of creamy risotto in minutes and broths that won't sit for hours and stink up the kitchen. He got it with the caveat that he would clean up any explosions. None yet, and I'm convinced now that there won't be any. Food is evenly cooked, fast, and has well developed flavors. This package comes with everything- CD, cookbook, pot. The only downside is the small size. If you're doing a lot of broths you might want to upgrade to the 7 liter."
4,Batlle cry,Hey! i just got this game and its so cool! There are 15 different battles to choose from like antitam and gettysburg even bull run. The campaign is cool too. the only bad thing is when you have to set it up because you gotta tear everything out. And its a little chalenging at first but you'll get the hang of it.
3,Battlecry: great for kids but....,"disappointing for adults. The major problem with Battlecry is the fact that it is more a game of chance than a game of skill. Your strategy and tactics are limited by the command cards you are dealt and the dice throws that you roll. Unrealistically, the number of dice that you roll is not decreased in proportion to the losses you have suffered. With a little imagination, the game could be salvaged with some rules modification."
4,AMAZING!!!,"This game, Battle Cry, is a very educational game that really makes you feel as if you're strategizing for the civil war. Your play decides the fate. It's also really fun!!!"
3,Brace yourself. This may sting a bit.,"Dash a bit into your hands and splash onto your face liberally. It'll make you smell good. It might cool your face after a shave (once the stinging sensation has subsided). But come on! This isn't facial medicine or anything like that. It's a decent product but only as much as any other run-of-the-mill after-shave/cologne product, be it Old Spice, New Spice, Nice Spice, or what-have-you."
2,More Cayce than Jung,"A light introduction to synchronicity that pays more attention to the prophecies and teachings of Edgar Cayce than the theories of Carl Jung, this book is far from an absolute text on the subject. The author even refers to occurences as being ""synchronous"", instead of the proper ""synchronistic"". It also contains a poor translation of the I Ching. I didn't find this one very helpful, and would recommend instead ""The Power of Flow"", a book that has much more of a grasp on the essence of synchronicity than this one."
2,Not as advertised,"Advertised as 12"", my clearance is 12"" on the nose, this wouldn't let my cabinet door shut. It's about 1/16-3/32 over.Other than that, it seems to be a quality piece, though I didn't assemble it."
4,Good for what it is and for the cost,"Overal, this is a good product and good value for what you get. My only gripe is that it's so tall and a lot of my spices won't fit on the top tier. This wouldn't be such a big deal except that the tiers are so thick that there's not as much room on the bottom as my old Lazy-Susan. I do like the non-skid surface, although it's not on the bottom, and it's good quality and so far, seems sturdy. The price, compared to others I've seen in the store, was a lot lower here on Amazon.com. I might buy another one sometime."
5,Copco Cabinet Turntable,I actually use this on top of my counter near the stove. I find it convenient to have spices that I use routinely right at hand. I can see everything without having to move things around like I have to do in the cabinets.
2,I expected more ideas and less complicated ones!,"I bought this book last year when it was published so there were no customer reviews thenm, and i wish there were.I bought the book based on the title, i expected easy and fast projects which give creative and lovely results. While the book is wonderful to browse because of its excellent photography, the projects are FAR from being easy and ""instant gratification"".Most of the projects have a long list of needed supplies, and the ideas weren't the ""ah, why didn't I think of that"" kind either. I was particularly annoyed by the large number of projects that do not CREATE anything, but rather decorate a glass ornament. I can think of ways to spice up a glass ball, thank you very much.I do NOT recommend this book only as a viewbook for getting in christmas mood, but there are better books out there for that. I give it two stars for the photography and design, but for contents it doesn't deserve it."
5,Very Catchy Music,"The lyrics in all the songs are very catchy and my 2 year old has added several words to her vocabulary. The interactive songs allows my daughter to ""touch her toes,"" and ""put her paws in the air!"" Even my husband and I go around the house singing Anne's songs. It is definitely a family friendly CD and your kids will especially love to dance and sing to it--you will NOT be disappointed."
1,Bright-Eyed and Busy-Tailed:More songs to sing and sign with kids and kritters,"This is a ""CD"", not a ""DVD"" therefore I would not recommend it!!!"
1,Disappointing,"Would be more accurately titled ""14 Worst and A Couple of Good Instrumentals"". As an inveterate F & S fan, I made the mistake of ordering the CD without looking at the song titles. As a result, and for the first time, I found several F and S songs I didn't like. Do yourself a favor, pass on this one."
3,Chasing Rainbows,"As I wish to leave no stone unturned, I read the book. Supposedly it was commissioned by the Vatican to ""clear up"" all the misinformation concerning the death of Pope John Paul I. Not only did it come ten years too late, but interviews that Mr. Cornwall conducts are all based on hearsay.He is a good writer and novelist as he describes the characters we are introduced to: Marcinkus has warts, another priest has decaying food particles on his clothes, another yellow teeth, the Pope peers up at him through scrutinizing eyes. The chapters are, thankfully, short and his ""investigation"" is light reading and light lifting.Compared with Yallop's multi-layered almost incomprehensible depth, this is a walk in the park.While applauding his effort, I am not convinced."
4,A Thief In The Night....,"Considering the subject matter, this book could have been a very difficult read. However, because of the format that is was written in, the book kept the readers attention the whole way through - well written and compelling.Mr. Cornwell's hypothesis of what really happened on the night of Pope John Paul I's death is highly plausible and is more than likely what did happen on that faithful night.Through both confusion and escalation of commitment, it is easy to see how being economical with the truth, by the Vatican hierarchy, that conspiracy theories have developedIt is pleasing to see too that while the ""Vatican"" sets standards for mankind as a whole (which there is nothing wrong with,) as an organisation it appears as flawed as any other man-made organisation.All-in-all, a great read !!!"
2,Received incorrect product,"The rating for this product is for the buying experience rather than the product itself.I ordered 024-032R (1 inch squares) but received 024-34R (1 inch rules) instead.Apparently, the product received is labeled by Amazon as ""Ampad 24-032R"", but it also has the manufacture label which indicates ""24-034R"". The content matches the manufacture's part number, but not Amazon's part number and description.I would advise perspective buyers to buy it elsewhere."
2,Their poorest offering,Probably the best Scottish folk outfit of all time but if I'd heard this album before the others I'd have written them off. Some good stuff like 'Roarin Donald' but found much of the rest rather uninteresting. Andy Stewart has a tremendous voice but somebody should advise him to give up writing his own material. I think thats where they went wrong with this one. Their other albums are just stupendous but this one is very thin indeed.
5,Great last album together,"This album is less traditional in tone than their previous albums. I especially like ""Wha'll be King but Charlie?"""
5,So sad,I found out Seamus' twin brother also died of brain cancer at the age of 22. What a heart wrenching and uplifting at the same time story......
5,What a Deal,"This performance is wonderfull. The narration on most others is done with an artificial ""poetic"" drone, whereas this is done in a natural tone of voice. The instruments are played excellently. The price definitely makes this the best value."
3,A Good Seat Belt....,"This dog seat said it would fit dogs up to 20 pounds..However, it's a little too snug on my sister's 15 pound terrier mix.It does fasten to the seat very securely, so if you hook your dog's harness to the thing that's supposed to keep them in the basket, it makes for a good puppy seat belt.Good product, but not for the use it describes..."
5,Favorite Book...,"Along with the other three books in the series, my 18 month old daughter has this one. She likes all four, but this one is probably my favorite. This book; along with the others, is so colorful and bright that it captures my daughters attention. The text is simple so it's just enough for her to sit through. I highly recommend all four books."
3,"Needs updating, but good basics","The information in this book provides a good basic introduction to the travel industry. However, there's been enough changes over the 10 years since it was published that several chapters contain information that is outdated and sometimes no longer accurate. An updated edition is needed, as there are few options available to the person seeking the material in this book."
5,Very Good,"If you are looking for a cd of soothing relaxing sounds of waves breaking on the rocks then look no further. This on has got it. There are no seagulls crying in the background, no seals grunting. Just waves breaking on the rocks. Great for going to sleep with."
4,Very relaxing,"My wife and I use this to help fall asleep and it works very well. My only small criticism is that, initially, we have to turn the volume up quite a bit to hear the dimmer ocean sounds then, when the first wave comes crashing down, just about get knocked out of bed. It's not a big deal--we just adjust the volume at that point and it's fine and it's likely this is due to our hearing difficulty and not a fault of the disc."
4,Sounds of th4 Earth: Ocean Waves,Great stress reducer! I use it whenever I need a break from life in general!
5,great condition/will order again,excellent. have purchased others from this producer and they are all excellent. Came in great condition/brand new. will definately order again!!!
5,Review by a Philippine Nena Fan Who Understands German,"This is Nena's second modern children's songs album and her latest solo album to date. In this album, Nena introduces not only more modern children's songs in either German or English, but also German pantomime songs( ""Ein Gespenst"", ""Der traurige Baer"", ""Wir entspannen uns"", ""Zwei Schmetterlinge auf einer Sommerwiese"", ""Maedchen vom Land"", and ""Ameisenhaufen"" ) as well as different music styles using one relatively short song ""A.U.S.-Aus""( Twist, Swing, Bossa Nova, Blues, Punk, and Acapella through her third son Samuel ). Another unique feature of this album is the involvement of members of a genuine German elementary school class in the recording of several songs included in this album. Hence, I highly recommed this to everyone, especially those like Nena, who have never lost their childlikeness( not childishness ), because they will truly appreciate it."
5,I love to watch this video clip and I simply loves it.,I don't mind watching Mariah Carey's video clips time and again.I just loves her powerful and strong voice.My favourite song is My All as it reminds me of my past relationship with my beloved man.
3,Interesting,"I have just started to read Barth's books so maybe I am being a bit harsh - however .... Barth likes to quote in Greek and Latin a lot which makes following him confusing to one who is not versed in those languages. His point of view is very interesting (enough so that I bought 3 of his books and his 14 volume series on ""Church Dogmatics."""
5,Barth for Beginners,"I have the Audible version of this book. Along with the Humanity of God, It's a useful book to read (or hear) before tackling the Church Dogmatics. It covers most of the basic themes of Barth's theology in his own words. Highly recommended."
4,Gifted,"For the collector of Texana books, this is a suitable selection. I did not read the book since it was a gift. This was specifically bought for a Texana library, and I believe the recipient liked this book."
4,"Practical, compact and great for beginners","Let's face it, grammar is hard enough in your native language. It's even harder in a foreign language-you don't need a thick complicated book covering every nuance of the language when you're staring out. This teach yourself book is well organized and not overwhelming like many other grammar books I've tried.Each chapter is a few pages long and covers a couple related grammar concepts. The topics are very practical for everyday situations. The topics get more difficult as you progress through the book.I've taken this book to Italy twice now and use it in conjunction with a dictionary and the Pimsleur audio course. It's great for travel because it's compact and easy to find the derivations of words you hear people use."
3,Martha Scott's best performance as dedicated teacher.,"The film belongs to Martha Scott who gives her best screen performance as Miss Bishop, a dedicated teacher, whose personal life is constantly being put on hold as she ministers to the needs of her pupils. Scott ages from a schoolgirl to an octogenarian and does a lovely, memorable job. The sentimental score is a plus. Oscar nom for Original Score."
2,DVD Review,this dvd is not worth buying needs to be remastered very difficult to see DO NOT BUY its a great movie just the dvd disc itself needs attention
5,Outstanding FAMILY movie,"I have seen this movie many times, and it always leaves mefeeling good. Miss Bishop is an amazing Dedicated TeacherA story of quiet courage and the power of teachers to help shape the lives of young people.I recommend this as a FAMILY movie it is excellent."
1,Boring,"I had to force myself to watch the first 20 minutes which was quite boring. The movie quality was poor and the 20 minutes I watched dragged on so I did not wish to persecute myself any longer. Even though I had 48 hours in which to complete my viewing of it, I did not take advantage of it. To me, what little I saw made me rate it a dud. Maybe someone who has seen it through its entirety can give it a fairer rating."
2,Just don't do it.,"This game is just not fun. The moves are so hard to do. There are way too many complicated things to do. Why can't shoot just be triangle, or hit be the circle etc. like most games? Ugh. Think we get rid of it as soon as possible."
3,"Ultra Violent, Foul Mouthed Bloodbath for Kids!",This game is so violent and disturbing that I had to get rid of it.No one under 17 should even watch it being played.Brutal.
2,Don't disappoint yourself,"Do yourself a favor and rent the game from your local video store before wasting your money. The one thing that I really hate about this game is that you cannot jump. How dumb is that? When playing the game you have to go uncessary routes in order to get places, because you cannot jump. The storyline is pathetic. I laugh everytime I look at the case of the game sitting on top of my tv, this is where the game will stay"
3,"Its ok, but may disappoint.","If you're NOT a fan of the movie, it probably won't be something you'll vastly enjoy. You may still get a little bit of fun out of the game though. It isn't all bad.. However, it is probably the second most disappointing game I (personally) have ever played.. That only being because I had extremely high expectations of this game. GTA SA type expectations.I had to run over a guy 5 times at full speed before I found out I couldn't kill peds. Lol, that destroyed it for me for a little while. As the game went on though, I got a bit more interested. Still never lived up to its full hype (of my expectancy) though. Considering I bought it new (at its time of release), as a kid (about 12 or 13) I especially felt ripped off.."
5,Tony at his best!,"When i moved out of my house and let my sons mother stay, she refused to give me back my PS2 and my Scarface game. So i bought the game again and another PS2 (why not have a ps2 and ps3?? lol) just to keep playing this game. Any gamer thats a scarface fan, or have ever even seen and loves the movie, this is a must have game. Old school all the way!!"
3,Good Product but not the best bang for buck,I can't deny that it's a good quality product but I regret purchasing such a small canner for so much money. It holds so few jars that it's not worth my time to can any goods. It is only good for pressure cooking a roast for dinner.
5,THE BEST!,"I have used many cookers and this is the best of all!.Simply great and it is an asset, do not get cheated bythe cheaper priced cooker. GOOD FOR ALL COOKING."
5,Perfection in cooking,"I have been using the Kuhn Rikons for the past 10 years. They are so well made and cook so perfectly, I often use them as everyday pots, even without the lids. To this day, the blue seal shows little sign of wear and the pots are as shiny as new. I assume I will be passing these on to the kids in about 40 years: they seem as though they will last that long."
2,A study in over-engineering,"Does the job just fine but no better than the $50 domestic branded models. Like all modern pressure cookers, it's very safe to operate but no more than any other on the market."
2,Just get a Presto!,"This unit is not very user friendly. It has a spring loaded pressure gauge which is very difficult to read and has a tendency to stick therefore the feedback on the cooking process is lousy. The Presto has a gravity based juggler that rocks and lets you know everything is cooking properly. Yes the highly polished 18/10 stainless is nicer looking than the standard stainless on the Presto buts adds nothing to durability, performance or end results. The Presto will last a lifetime; this unit may drive you nuts with that gauge."
5,Get rid of your microwave!,"We got this a month ago and use it for something almost everyday. Everything cooks so quickly and has a terrific taste and texture, especially beans. It is worth every penny because there is no unhealthy aluminum, just easy-to-clean stainless steel. A must for vegetarians or those who want to eat more healthfully. Just don't forget to get Lorna Sass's cookbooks to go along with it."
5,The best presure cooker I have ever used!,"I purchased the Kuhn Rikon 7-Liter Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker because I wanted to cook the meals my father (Hungarian) had made whilst I was a child. Namely, goulash... And gee, is this a lovely item! Sure, you need to regulate the heat, so did he (and his grandma). This one is _so_ much easier though....With this model you don't have the steaming and the hissing, moisture leaving your dinner. This baby is so _very_ quiet.. I have made so many meals with this cooker, and my wife loves it. Regulating the temerature is easy, the two bars (high and low pressure) are so very easy to read. Just adjust the heat.I had an electric stove top first, it was harder to use with a pressure cooker. Now I have gas, and easy easy....Of course, I needed to cook more than goulash...Great value, more than yes! Quick cooking, good cooking. Do yourself a favour, this is a great buy..."
5,K-R Pressure Cooker,"Tried a Presto pressure cooker first and hated the noise of the rocking valve. Things took longer than they were supposed to. The Kuhn Rikon cooked everything I have tried from rice to stock to roasts to beans perfectly. The valve is marked showing you high and low pressure is very helpful - no guess work like with the Presto. I rarely used a pressure cooker before, but now I would never give it up."
5,Best cooking method EVER!,"I wish I'd known about all the benefits of pressure cooking years ago. WAY faster, easier, cleaner, healthier, more energy efficient, better tasting, the list goes on forever! This brand is the only type I've owned but I know a bit about cooking utensils and Kuhn Rikon seems like they build 'em to last. If you cook at all, or are looking to start, a pressure cooker seems to me like an essential. Also, the energy savings this product produces are amazing, for those of us trying to be more ""green."""
3,Oh Well ...,"Well, I was very exited when this appeared in my Gold Box and purchased immediately! The Mercedes Benz of Pressure Cookers! Unfortunately, as a PC novice, I found it very difficult to regulate the pressure on my electric cooktop and was never really sure if there was ""excessive hissing"" or not. Decided to send to my mom (a PC expert) in hopes she'll have better luck. Also found the tall shape awkward to work with - had to use BBQ tools to reach all the way in."
5,Foci shipped on time and in great condition,The Digital Foci arrived at my daughter's house on schedule and in great condition (Xmas present for my wife). When I looked at the Foci I could not get it to turn on ... even after charging it. An email to Digital Foci stating the problem was responded to in less than an hour and I found there was a user error ... lock was on so the Foci could not be accidentally started. Great people to deal with!! Now I hope my wife likes it.
5,Excellent!,This product is excellent! All my photos and memories are now on the device I can share and remember. I had photos from 1997 when I went to Belize birding. I scanned them all and downloaded them into this device.I can even watch the slides while music plays in the background. This isthe best gift my husband gave me.
3,"Disappointing, I was expecting something new and different.","The book is well written but the argument is the same; I was expecting to read something new from the author. Perez is a brillant author/historian/professor but somehow i was disappointed in the fact that she did not address any new arguments in her book. Perez needs to take us a step further in her writings and explore other issues/arguments that surround women of color.Will I continue to support her as an author/historian, yes. She remains to be a brillant woman who is not afraid to speak her mind."
2,Expected More,After reading the first few pages of the book I realized that I was back in my Graduate class at Utep. I was expecting something more and different from Dr. Perez.
5,Worked Great,"I bought a used 2004 Sienna with no key Fob, I ordered this one and it worked great. It was easy to program didn't take long, took about five to ten minutes."
3,Great Tracks but ...,"I bought this album having heard only Queen of Argyle so I didn't really know what to expect. Having listened to the CD I really only love that one track. Had I known what the rest of the album was like I would not have bought it -- not that the CD is bad, just doesn't catch my interest."
2,Come on guys let's not get ahead of ourselves,"If you're looking for a history of sexuality, this is not the book for you. Unlike Madness and Civilization, this work has very few historical details, and those it includes basically just support the theory of the text. Also, unlike M&C, this book is almost entirely theory, and the theory isn't even very interesting. You thought Victorian society was repressive? Well it also showed an unheard of explosion of sexual discourses! Foucault questions why we have made sex the bearer of a secret truth that must continually be sought, and continually elude us. This is likely the least sexy book ever written on sexuality; probably owing to Foucault's belief that sexuality is a ""historical product."""
3,The History of Sexuality an Introduction by Michael Foucault,"""The History of Sexuality"" by Michael Foucault was a very good book. It is a very confusing book. I was assigned this book for my LGBT studies book in college and it was even difficult to understand for most of my class. Michael definitely crosses the line into some topics that some authors would not even consider to go into. The chapter about The Repressive Hypothesis was very interesting to me since I am a psychology major; it was neat to correlate both of my classes to this book by Michael Foucault. I would definitely recommend this book, if you would like to be challenged but are definitely ready for a good read!"
3,dry as dust discourse on sex but interesting anyway,"unlike his idol bataille who did write some very good books that you can read with one hand, foucault on sex is just about as erotic as a discarded coke can.but his method of 'reverse-engineering' a knowledge industry that craves out a human activity or phenomenon and imposes control and power over it is fascinating. he probably overstates his thesis but it is still a lot of food for thought."
1,Abysmal,"All Volumes Reviewed: Is this the work of Michel Foucault, the author of ""Order of Things,"" ""Discipline and Punish,"" and ""Archeology of Knowledge?"" Surely, this must be a hoax. Foucault is notoriously provocative, keenly insightful, and always virulent. So what happened here? Hardly much of a history, anything but provocative, entirely pedestrian, already outdated, and woefully incomplete. Accessibility is not a problem, unlike ""Archeology of Knowledge,"" but truly lacking in information, perspective, and relevance. Compare, for example, this trite and superficial reading with Compton's expansive and exhaustive ""Homosexuality and Civilization."" After all, Foucault was gay and into sado-masochism. The two are incomparable. A complete waste of time (since I was sure Foucault had something quixotic to write over three volumes), but hope never materialized into reality. PASS."
2,Foucault valorized child molestation,"Michel Foucault says that we are all prepared to die for sex. He did. But should children be forced to prostitute themselves, and die from the diseases they get, as he implies that they should in his anecdote about M. Jouy, a field hand, who pays children to blow him in the 18th century? This unbelievable anecdote appears on pp. 31-32. It's so badly written that maybe nobody actually reads that far. But he very pointedly says that statutory rape should not be a crime on the books, that it's a normal part of any French village, and that young girls should give hand jobs and/or blow jobs (he never explains 'the game of curdled milk' and leaves it as a euphemism) to simple-minded menial laborers to earn their keep.Foucault actually asks what's the big deal.This book made me sick to my stomach. It is mortifying that such a predatory madman should be revered in the halls of academe. Can anybody in a university English department think?"
4,Review of Hurley's 'History of Sexuality',"The translation sadly lacks an introduction, but the work itself is more than adequate. Hurley has a skill at making Foucault sound like it was written in plain English, which is neither true nor plausible, but in any case incredibly helpful. There is an index, but no footnotes or endnotes. It's a very bare edition. I dare to criticize the cover design (for both editions). Do these have anything do with the content of the work?"
4,Briliantly pessimistic,"Foucault has an extraordinary Nietzchean ability to dismentle accepted ideas and raise new paradoxes. The irony he poses: the more we cultivate individuality and pursue personal freedom, the more hopelessly entangled we become in the menacing net of science and ""bio-power."" Is Foucault truly unique, or is he being clever; is he a thinker or simply an iconoclast? It's for you to determine. A very interesting book."
5,like watching a movie!,"AWESOME! I actually bought this for $1 in a hardware store, thinking it was gonna be junk! Non-stop action and a REAL believable story. The shootout at the end in the White House was insane!This is a book that HAS TO be made into a movie."
5,An Exciting Read!,This turned out to be a very exciting book.The book begins witha bang when Iranian Commandos sink an American shipin the Persian Gulf.There is much loss of American life as a result of the sinking.The Americans retaliate by bombing the Iranian oilproduction facilities on Karg Island.Iran decides to gain vengance by sending a well trained team of commandos into America to attack the Marine base at Camp LeJuene and to commit the ultimate act of terror by assassinating the President of theUnited States.The only person who percieves a threat from Iran isa Department of Defense aid named Welsh.The book is fast paced and very action packed.You will find it hard to put this book down Read it and you will enjoy it.
5,Wonderful love affirming novel,"This novel is a winner from start to finish. It deals with weightier subjects than the usual romance novel (child abuse, drug abuse, incest, adultery, prostitution) but at it's heart it is a wonderful romance. It also has wonderful humor laced throughout. Many times in the book I wanted to reach out and hug Crystal as she struggled to make a life for herself in a better place (physically and later emotionally). Her new roommate and new friend Laura was a complete rock of support the whole time. It was interesting to watch Crystal becoming supportive of Laura when she needed Crystal.I hope the authors revisit Jenny some day - she is a very interesting person and deserves good things to come her way.I have read this novel many times and it is on the top shelf of my bookcase to read again."
5,A Keeper,"Within the Realm of the Dying Sun is the third release by Dead Can Dance and one of their very best efforts. It was released in 1987 and follows another excellent album of their's, 1986's Spleen and Ideal (also recommended). A somewhat somber effort by Dead Can Dance, it is almost symphonic at times in its use of percussion and brass. The album is divided into first Brendan Perry's songs which are followed by Lisa Gerrard's beautiful vocalizations.Definitely one of Dead Can Dance's best efforts and should be part of any fan's collection."
5,"DcD, another great album",Well if you like them this is a must have. Lots of that mind stretching harmonies and melodies.
4,Dead Can Sing To,"I first heard of DCD about 12 months ago when a friend sent me some samples of their songs. One of the songs that particularly captured my attention was YULUNGA and I knew that I had to hear more from this unique groupe!I then got my hands on Within The Realm Of A Dying Sun. I perticularly enjoyed the songs by Lisa my faves on this album are Summoning Of The Muse,Anywhere Out Of The World,Xavier and Cantara. I look farward to hearing more DCD albums and have looked at the reviews and it looks as if AION might be next!"
3,Do a sound check first!,"Best advice on this cd is do a sound check first! I LOVE DCD and would highly recommend their music but this is NOT my favorite! So why do people check reviews anyway? . . .it's just someone's opinion . . .I read these wonderful reviews and found that this cd is my least favorite DCD . . . .I love Lisa Gerrard for her incredible talent but that is not reflected on this album. I love her haunting middle eastern flavors, the driving rhythms and her wonderful Celtic influences. . . suffice to say this album does not offer that. . . . I found it slow, morose, and boring. . . . . again sound check and make your own opinion . . ."
3,Moody and tres goth,"This album is so-so as compared with amazing CDs such as ""Aion"" or ""Toward the Within"". Missing here are any songs with the driving beat or rhythms which makes so much of their music a trip to hear. This album is all slow and moody and goth...not bad, but no where near as good as later efforts by this duo."
5,Narnia Figurines,The transaction went smoothly. The figure arrived in perfect condition in a timely manner. My nephew is very happy!
5,This Book is Excellent,I recently borrowed this book from a friend of mine. It's an excellent read. It's well written. The authors keep the readers engaged and the theology is very sound. The practical how-to's on asserting one's self are great. I highly recommend this book.
5,Interesting and fun!,"I had no idea that our adult cravings for comfort food form during our few few years on this planet. The material in this Dvd was absolutely fascinating! While I am not a parent yet, I found the information very applicable to my own life. And if I ever become a father, I will be mindful of the foods that I will feed my kids.Bottom line: I would recommend this dvd to anyone who is interested in early childhood development!"
3,Wrong tittle,"While much valuable information is in video, I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it focused on children's eating patterns. A peak at the past sure, but what about solving today's temptations. Showing me what was wrong when I was a child is not enough."
3,Something fishy here,"I am Vegan and i eat a lot of raw and live foods. Why are the older Boutenko and A. K. Fuller so overweight? I love green smoothies, but this appears to be a thinnly disguised sales pitch for the wonderful world of Boutenkos."
4,Very good coffee!,"I like this coffee - it has a nice flavor, not too overpowering. I will definitely check out other flavors by Coffee Masters and come back for more Cinnamon Nut Swirl."
5,"A most enjoyable book, one of my favourites","This is a delightful book, one of Anne's extensive Dragon series, and one of my personal favorites. I discovered the two Dragonsinger books in the local library while I was recovering from a work injury and devoured them both in 48 hours.I bought both many years ago, and now have purchased them again as Kindle books.They are about a young and gifted girl and are ideal for young readers. I have just re-read them (again)in my 50s and still love them both."
3,Great for dragon fans,"I find the other books by this author to be a bit heavy handed and sexist (I'm sure she didn't mean them to be that way; it's more that they're rather dated). However this book is a favorite with wonderful imaginative dragon characters, an interesting heroine and a deftly imagined world. The pacing can be a bit slow, but for a reader interested in the story this shouldn't be a problem. Well worth the read."
4,I liked this book a lot. I would reccomend it.,This book was very good. It is about a girl who goes and lives with little dragons. She is a very good music player but she can't play where she lives because she is a girl. This book is very exciting. It also is very interesting because she makes friends with the little dragons. Anne Mcafferey does a very good job of explainig the charactors. You really feel as though you are there. You should definetely read this book.
2,Dragonsong was an interesting book.,"DragonSong was written by Anne McCaffrey. She made the story very interesting.This book is an imaginative book filled with fasntasy and is fun to read. Dragonsong was a very interesting story because of the dragons and firelizards. It was interesting because of the way the dragons and firelizards were able to go ""between"". The way the people of Pern used the dragons to kill the Thread was also interesting. Seeing how that was the fastest and best way to kill the Thread. The story in the book was unclear as to how the firelizards helped the people of Pern. Altogetherthis was an interesting story with intriguing characters. I enjoyed reading Dragonsong, because of how interesting it was. I think that it is a good book to read if your into fantasy,and mild si-fi,or if you like to read about dragons. This is a book for you. Dragonsong was very captivating towards the end of the story, and I encouage you to read this book."
2,Dragon song was a very exciting book.,I happen to enjoy reading a good book. I am always ready to open one up and get into it as soon as possible. Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey was an exciting book. Dragonsong was a book filled with excitement. The author adds many things that help fill it with excitement. For instance the threadfall provided much excitement with its deadly charactaristics. Therefore the author explains that the fierce dragons battle this deadly thread to maintain life on Pern. Menolly was almost killed by this treaturous thread and that experience was exciting enough to exemplify the the excitment of this book. I found this book to be very complicated yet hidden in all the complexities I found a very important moral and that was to never give up on what you truly love. This was a very good book but due to its complexity I recomend it to all high school students.
5,Dragonsong,"""The book was truly remarkable. As I read it I really didn't want it to end.Anne McCaffrey is a very talented author."""
4,Enjoyable,"This book is about Menolly, a tomboyish girl who loves to make music. Her parents, boring, traditional, and narrow-minded, do not want her to make music in any form, and make every attempt to discourage her from it.After she injures her hand and is told that her hand will always be crippled, and she will never be able to play any instruments again, Menolly runs away from home. She has many adventures. She discovers and help a group of fire lizards(smaller versions of dragos).This book has a predictable plot and ending. It is an enjoyable read, with vivid description, but may not live up to your expectations if you are looking for an edgy, controversial, thought-provoking book."
5,I Love Dragonsong!,"I think that in some ways, this book was very realistic compared to some teenagers lives.It is well-written, original, and AWESOME! I recommend this book to everyone!"
4,A Great and Imaginative Adventure for Fictional Readers,"I think this is one of the best fictional books I've ever read. I love all of the characters and I especailly loved it when they talked about the dragons and fire lizards. This book is well written, has good descriptions, and is very entertaining. I couldn't wait to read on, and had to read it all in one day. There were a few holes in the plost and a few things that didn't quite make sense, but besides that a great fictional book. I loved how creative Anne McCaffrey is. This is the first book of hers I read."
5,This book is great.,"What is wrong with those people out there? You say that this book is imaginative and good, and then you proceed to say that high-schoolers should read it. Then, you give it one or two stars. While this book is not a must read, it is interesting and quite good. I don't think that it is boring.By the way, why do several review say the exact same thing but say that the location is different?"
2,OverAll,"The characters in Dragonsong all have very different personalities from one another, which makes them interesting in my opinion. Menolly's character at first is mostly annoying but later really develops. She acts as any human, would making her character believable. For example, she runs away from Half Circle Sea Hold when she is unhappy. Also the setting is believable because when Ann McCaffery describes it, she gives Pern characteristics that are recognizable to Earth.The book is hard to connect to and does not involve the reader, though the details are consistent and descriptive. The author makes the firlizards seem natural. She does this by having them act like a dog or another animal that people react to. The plot is hardly interesting or entertaining even with good characters and details. However, the story is not slow moving or hard to understand. Overall I would not recommend the book unless the reader is very much interested in fantasy."
4,A different kind of good!,"A very good book. Anne McCaffrey has outdone her other works with this one! This book exhibits the usual rebellious elements, without using the sexual experiences of the others."
3,Very original and light-hearted,"I admit, when I pick up a fantasy book, I'm usually craving some sort of crazy plot with action and close-calls...all spiraling down to one final battle scene. This book was nothing like that. It's about a quiet girl who lives her every day life until events take her to another more exciting (but still pretty tame in terms of fantasy) setting. Although this book didn't grip me with a sense of anguish, glory, and exhilaration like some more exhuberant fantasy series, it was still very original and entertaining. It's good for a quick, light read. McCaffrey was able to build great characters within a small amount of time (the book is only a little over 100 pages long), which is rare in most fantasy books today. It has hooked me enough that I will probably continue the next few books in the series when I need a break from some of the more action-packed fare that I'm used to reading."
2,Dragonsong : Undetailed and Messy,"In the book, the main character Menolly, lives a very harsh lifestyle. She lives in the Half Circle Village.There she usually plays a harp but when she cuts and paralyzes her right hand,she is unable to play. Then she goes out, finds and lives with 9 fire lizards and their eggs.I thought the main character Menolly in the book was very detailed, but everyone else seemed blurry.The author only included details about Menolly and not the other people or the setting of the book. The author does not include detailson the place or the events. She really leaves you hanging. There are many things that are unclear in the book, such as, What is thread? What is menollys home like? Almost no where in the book does it mention a different planet or pern.This book would be much better if it had more details and was well explained. I would not recremend this book."
1,I found that Dragonsong is a well written fantasy.,In conclusion I found that Dragonsong is a well written fantasy that stretches reality and pulls you into the life of a girl on a far off place faced with all sorts of problems. I would recommend this book to anyone from fantasy lovers to people who just want a break from reality.
1,just another dragon book...,"This book is like every other dragon book that I've ever read. Boring. It's time to take it to the next level. Like G. L. Strytler's Dragons vs. Dinosaurs, or something."
3,a little boring,"I heard a lot of good reviews of this book and in fact it was recommended to me. I'm a fan of fantasy but this book simply doesn't appeal to me. While Menolly is supposed to be an atypical-yet-admirable heroine, I just don't think her character is strong enough. The plotline is also pretty predictable. Since the beginning it is very obvious she and the new harper would be romantically involved.I personally think this book is boring because nothing really happens in this book. Nothing exciting I'd expect from a fantasy book anyway. I'll still give the second book a shot though. Hopefully that one will be better cause I'm assuming the first volume is a sort of introduction and that's why it's going slow."
2,Boring.....,"I never really liked fantasy books but I decided to try this one. It's pretty boring, I must say! Its about a girl named Menolly who likes to sing. Thats it! Its boring! I definately don't recommend it to anyone under 12."
1,I think Dragonsong was confusing but exciting.,It was exciting sometimes With the dragonriders Plus the dragon eggs hatching And the finding of the dragon eggs It was also confusing It started out in the middle of the story Also Had to many names Plus it didn't explan enough in the begging And terms it didn't explain I didn't really like it because it was to confusing but made up some of it by the exciting parts. Recomendation I don't think you should read it because it was to confusing
3,Dragonsong can be a confusing book.,"I enjoy reading good books, so when I read Anne McCaffrey's Dragonsong, I thought it was a confusing book, which brought new ideas to our mind. Dragonsong can be a confusing book. Things such as Thread falls can become confusing. Something never heard of before. Falling organisms that destroy everything that they come into contact with, except for bodies of water. Paying attention to all of the new names can become quite difficult also. These names such as Menolly, Mavi, and Yanis are all complictated. This happens with all of the new, fictional concepts that people have never thought about before. I think that this book was very magical. You are forced to use your imaginatio, picturing the dragons. I would recommend this book to to a person who enjoys reading fanticies. It is a well written book and interesting book."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"First off, fire lizards are cool. Smart, flying lizards are cool in general. They would also help with feral cat problems, I reckon.This is the story of an outcast young musician girl, who loses her sponsor, ends up wandering, meets some fire lizards, does some good work and ends up living at a much groovier weyr."
5,A must read,Slow at d start den it gets veri veri interesting in d middle til d end. Definitely shud b in ur collection.
5,A CURE FOR WHAT SWAY'S YOU,The cure for the difinitive exploration of chant. A repetitive and structurally diverse spread of lyricks pulling and tugging from the deepest of with in. And truly The strongest element a song writer can ever possess is to be able to touch the soal... with out ripping your heart as well thank you so much for that. ricksarah@nwinfonet.com sarah trusley
4,Good Celtic music,I love the music. I was surprised that there was so little included on the CD. (only 3 tracks)
5,SIMPLY MAGICAL!,"When I Saw this video on MTV Latino a year later it was release, I fell in love with this song!, I had to buy the album, but then the single was available, this song is going to take you on a journey!, great voice!, great taste.....simply magical!"
1,too thin,The problem with this flip chart is that anything you write on one page bleeds through to the next page...the paper is just too thin for most presentations.
4,Wana play king of the mountain?,"Well, you have to topple these guys first. Bolt Thrower's simplistic yet catchy style of death/grind/doom/thrash metal bulldozes over any and all commers without quarter. One of the most devastatingly brutal bands I have ever heard. ""Who Dares Wins"" is a compilation of some songs (mostly rare tracks) from their earlier recordings (Warmaster, Realm of Chaos era) and puts them all one one CD. A great introduction for a new listener and a great addition to any existing collection. Any fan of truly brutal metal is sure to appreciate this album and this band."
2,A bit disappointing,"Bolt Thrower is a great band, but something about this compilation just didn't do it for me. It probably has to do most with production quality. A lot of the songs here would be awesome if you could actually HEAR them better. Especially the live tracks. Not that I expect all the older, rarer stuff to be absolute top-notch quality, but the live recordings on here get so garbled that I find them hardly worth listening to. On the upside, the new 'World Eater' track is interesting and 'Dying Creed' is definitely one of Bolt Thrower's best songs (at least out of what's included on this compilation). I actually gave 'Dying Creed' quite a bit of air time on the radio while DJing in Nashville, TN. Though there is some good stuff on this album, I would only truly recommend it to people who are already fans. Otherwise, I'd suggest starting out with something that's already well established with better production quality."
1,ALREADY HAVE THESE SONGS,"There is no need to waste your money on this if you have their previous CD'S because your not getting anything new on this release. Just a couple of live tracks,and whats going on with the sound quality on this release,its pretty bad."
1,Incredibly Out Of Date,"In just four years this book is so out of date as to be worthless. Some places no longer exist, some are 40-70% more in price, both of which can be a shock when you get somewhere with your child.For example, KidSlope doesn't exist and hasn't for more than two-and-a-half years. Elitch Gardens Amusement Park is listed in there but not forthe prices listed and they charge for parkingFrankly, I'm afraid to attempt anything else that's in this book and will look on-line for something more current. Like something from this century. One would assume that Chronicle Books would update their information a little more frequently, but I guess not. I'm going to suspect any and all of their books in the future."
5,Awesome Devotional,"I usually don't like devotional books. I especially don't like when they have dates at the top of the page to tell you exactly what pace you are to go. The thing I like the most about this one is that it is mostly scripture. My girfriends and I are using it in our small group Bible study. When we discuss each chapter, we usually don't ever get past the scripture... which is great. Some of the readings with each chapter are weighty, requiring a second reading and making you think past the surface. Since this book is out of print... we all ordered used from Amazon. Love it!"
4,Strong flex rim,"VERY solid rim, easy to mount with a 5x5 or 5x4 bolt pattern. Comes with 3/8"" bolts about 3 1/2"" long. I had to buy longer bolts to go thru 3/4 plywood and a 4x4 treated lumber frame member on my homebrew backboard. Came with a reasonable quality net. Only complaint - the cover for the tension spring was a little difficult to fasten in place - screw holes didn't quite line up. The cover is as heavy-duty as the rim base itself. Mounting instructions are pretty sketchy, but should be unnecessary."
5,"Great rim, very solid, easy installation","I am very pleased with this rim. All the right parts were included, the installation instructions were pretty simple, it's very heavy-duty. It's very durable but still has the breakaway feature that makes it much better than most outdoor inflexible rims or even worse those double rims that make it nearly impossible to make buckets. Which is what I do. On the reg."
3,Kensington Smarttip for Dell Notebooks,"A necessary item for use with the Kensington Universal Notebook Power Adapter if you want to use it with a Dell Notebook. Very easy to use, although I have had to replace my tip twice in the last year and a half. The internal connection breaks over time with use."
1,Does not work with Dell Latitude 620,"I was using this product with the Dell Latitude 610 and was extremely happy with it. Recently my computer got upgraded to a Dell Latitude 620. Now it will not charge the battery. At boot, the computer gives a warning ""processor speed may be lower and will not charge battery"".I cannot take *only* this adpater with me on travel as a result. Kensington claims it should work with the D620 - but it does not. I have seen posts on the Dell site from other users saying they have the same issue with the Latitude D820. Dell confirmed that the D620 and D820 share the same motherboard.Buyer-beware!"
1,SMart Tips,I NEVER RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT. I ORDERED IT A MONTH AGO AND IT NEVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CAME
5,This book is a treasure!,"Bravo to Carol Avery for writing such a wonderful book! ""And With a Light Touch"" contains chapter after chapter of helpful ideas that can be implemented in the classroom, but the author also has such an honest and insightful voice, I actually put aside the novel I was reading and looked forward to reading about Avery's adventures in the classroom! Avery books gives a gold standard of value to the often overlooked teacher's anecdote, I wish more folks would share the way she does. As a mother of a first grader, I was very curious as to what the experience of teaching and learning in the classroom was like, and this book gave me a real inside view. I balked at the textbook price for a paperback, but this book was worth every penny and I would recommend it to anyone interested in teaching, children, or a good story."
4,An Interesting Approach to Teaching Writing,Carol Avery offers her view to writers workshop for teachers who teach writing. The strategies used in the book can be adapted to fit other grade levels. Teachers will find this book to be a useful resource in the classroom.
3,"Call it ""Metal Tricks 101""","This book is more a survey of guitar tricks than anything. You'll receive a very basic overview of several different tricks like raking, harmonics and whammy bar use, but you won't find a lot of details or depth to the material presented.The teaching material is very brief, generally only few sentences for each trick. Having worked through Stetina's ""Speed Mechanics for Lead Guitar,"" I was also accustomed to having lots of examples to practice along with to really drive home the new material. Unfortunately, you'll only find an example or two for each new idea presented.Overall, this will wet your pallete to dig a little deeper into the tricks presented here, but it will by no means give you more than a ""101"" level understanding."
1,Heavy Metal Guitar Tricks,"I bought this book thinking that Im going to learn the tricks of the trade about making unique sounds, As i was led to believe that this book has it all, As it was marketed for beginners aswell as advance players. Now Ive been playing guitar for over 15 years. Upon receiving this book and taking a brief glance at it. I realised that i must be a better player than Steve Vai, as I already knew every thing that this book had to offer.In Brief:If your starting to play guitar or just learning lead guitar, this book is great.. But if youve been playing for a while or you are in a band, dont waste your time with this book."
5,Great,"I have been taking these vitamins for several years, and I can tell a difference in my energy level. These vitamins are keepers!"
1,Falls apart in no time,At first I was thrilled about this bag but within a few short months the zipper on one of the side pockets broke and the shoulder strap pad ripped off. For an Eddie Bauer product I was very disappointed.
3,"Not perfect, but worth it.","I loved about a 1/4 of these songs and didn't like the rest. Which is better than any other tribute I've heard. It's worth it alone to hear the very different takes on the songs. My faves - Danny Dean's rockabilly ""Two Hearts"", Trespassers William's gorgeous ""Love is Blindness"" and Aaron Kaplan's soulful ""One""."
4,Hugo Alfvén: Symphony No. 1,"This is wonderful, outstanding music! I would make this recording required listening for anybody familiar with Alfvén's splendid ""Midsommarvaka"" (Swedish Rhapsody No. 1)."
1,repairs very pricey,I purchased this tv March 2006. Paid 1050.00 and since have had an additional 1100.oo in repairs and mailing charges to lg. That works out to 500.00 per year. Not very good buy!!!!!
2,Mostly DAA Tuning,"Most of the book is for DAA tuning. She doesn't present DAD tuning until page 70, then alternates between the two."
3,A pleasant surprise.,"Asaro created a cast of likable, believable, sympathetic characters; deep, textured worlds; and well thought political tension. I could do without the romance, but it's not so pervasive as to ruin the story."
5,Skyfall,I love this book. I'm almost halfway and I can't put the book down. I've read all the other 8 6 or comething books before this one and its nice to finally read the story about Roca and Eldrinson.
4,Does a good job!!,I have been cooking using this pressure cooker and so far I like how quick it cooks. I have been using anotherbrand for over 40 yrs. I like the quality of the Kuhn Rikon but was disappointed that a trivet wasn't included and had to buy it separately. The trivet is used for certain veget.I like the idea of the small size and can be used like a fry pan. There is a glass lid available when used as a fry pan.I have recommended this to friends and family. Two years ago I purchased a larger one for our son.
5,It is a great book if you are interested in Ninjutsu.,"Passed down through the centuries from father to son, Master to disciple, the Tiger scroll transmitted the secret instructions of one of Japan's most infamous and deadly Ninja clans. The book covers such areas as carrying secret messages, sabotage, and assassination. It also gives you back ground information on how they trained, executed their missions, and lived their lives. The result is a cleverly blended and transmitted text that will give readers of interest in the Martial Arts a greater understanding for the lifestyle they love."
1,Not For Everyone,"Certainly cannot recommend it as the adhesive is poor and space where the decal is supposed to fit is anything but flat, making it even more difficult to apply.That said, if you are very careful and lay it just about perfect without having to adjust it in any way the result is adequate. Barely.Still, definitely not recommended."
1,Stay Away,This is the worst thing I ever bought on Amazon. I followed all the directions and the decals won't stay on. Worst part is that the shipping cost more than the item. Stay Away.
5,Endless inspiration for creative possibilities.,"This book is an incredible showcase of contemporary embroidery, with a wide representation of styles. Some of the artists have preferred to work within established embroidery traditions, and others have gone beyond the standard definition of their craft. The photographs in this book will open minds to the creative possibilities of embroidery & provide endless inspiration for all enthusiasts. It's a great book which I recommend."
5,This CD rips,"Get this: one night about 2 months ago, I heard ""Every Breath You Take"" by The Police on the radio. And I got to thinking how cool it would be if a punk band did a version of it. The next night I went to a concert where Fanmail was playing, who I had never heard of before. I knew the name, just not the sound. Well, they put on an AWESOME show, and what do ya know, the last song they played was a punk version of ""Every Breath You Take"". The boys read my mind, and they did NOT let me down. Their album rox, the music rox, and they rock as people as well. This is a definent must have for anyone with some taste and money."
5,kick @$$ cd,This cd is not normal christian rock cd. THis is a cd that both secular and christian fans can enjoy. If you like Weezer then you'll love Fanmail.
4,had to have song,"The movie was awsome. I just got one or two of the songs stuck in my head, so I had to get the soundtrack."
2,ODD,"I loved the movie! The CD, Hmmmmmmmmmm, still trying to get it to grow on me. ""Close to You"" and the last song are awesome."
4,great cd,"Mirrormask is such a trippy movie it's easy to forget it was supported with great music. You'll be surprised how many tracks blended into the background and how vividly you recall the ones that didn't. My favorite? Close to You, proving how even easy listening can be very wrong and creepy without giving up being smooth and pretty."
5,"Ooo La La, Cha, Cha, Cha!","I picked up the DVD MirrorMask as my son and I love fantasy films. When the opening music started I was enchanted. I've never watched a film where the music compliments and unites the scenes of a movie as this one does. The music made the movie. I especially loved Josefine Cronholm's vocals on ""Close to You"" (a mesmerizing scene in the film) and ""I Aplogised"". Other notable songs are Mrs. Bagman's Rhumba, A New Life, Butterfingers, and My Waltz For Newk. If you haven't scene the movie I would rent it and see what you think of the crazy mix of circus, jazz, Scandinavian, and Far Eastern influences found in the soundtrack. Iain's soprano sax and Stian's accordion playing are present throughout the soundtrack giving it cohesiveness. If you love jazz, bossanova ,or downtempo electronica/ambient music you will probably enjoy this soundtrack."
1,Sent me the WRONG Item,They sent me the wrong item and now it will cost me more time and money to send it back to get the correct one than the item costs. You might be better off calling them to make sure they know what to send you first. I lost all my money with them.
1,one doesn't work,"I received two wall chargers, Jan 2013. One of them works and the other doesn't. Not worth returning. It is very irritating."
4,Weird and wonderful,"Why haven't more people read and reviewed this book???This is the story of a boy with a gift - the gift to touch people with love, giving them visions of heaven.He is generous with his gift, offering his body up to be used and abused, perhaps because he knows how good receiving that love feels, having seen the visions once himself.However, while he's able to give love to others, the love he desires remains elusive to him, and though he goes through life hopeful of getting that feeling back, we know it's too late as he is telling his story from his death bed where he is slowly turning into gold.This book could well be a modern-day fairy tale, apart from that fairy tales are not usually associated with harsh reality and squalid backdrops.Despite its sordid ""surroundings"", this is a beautiful book."
4,this beauty within..................,"To love and the ability to give love in stranger than strange contexts, is a beautiful experience.Moved me till all is 'gold'"
4,Hard wired ......... needed,Ok the pump is great .... but nowhere do the tell you that you can not just plug this in. You need a electrician to HARD ~ WIRE this to get it working.
5,wayne pumps,"works fine. Good price for a company people say is good quality. Cast iron is MUCH better than plastic, and a pump that senses when the pressure is low so that it doesn't burn itself out pumping air - both very desirable features.We thought we were having problems with the pump, but it turned out to be the water supply. Wayne Pumps customer service was quick and responsive. They will take very good care of you. I can't tell you how pleased we've been with the company and their customer service. I HIGHLY recommend the company and their products. This pump works great!"
1,Water pump,Pump was installed and leaks.the leak has slowed but we will have to replace it when we are able and when we have a replacement
3,jet pump,The pump did not work when it arrived. My son was able to take it apart and file it to make it work. So now it is working OK. I guess that was to be expected since it was a returned article.
5,Brilliant!,"""So Many Partings"" was the first CD I heard by Silly Wizard, and I *had* to have it. The musicianship is marvelous on the instrumentals (Phil Cunningham has *got* to be the most amazing accordionist ever). However, it was Andy M. Stewart's voice and lyrics that really got hold of me and didn't let go. ""The Valley of Strathmore"" brought tears to my eyes upon the first listen ... incredibly beautiful ... and I am still known to shed a tear when I hear it again. I cannot recommend this CD highly enough to admirers of Celtic music."
3,It's Alright for ages 1-7,"The movie was great in theaters but at home with even the best speakers couldn't top it. I gave it a three 'cause of the song ""take me There""... but i didn't give it a five 'cause it was real short and was really exhausting after watching it once. I reccommend it to infants."
1,Doesn't work!,"I tried the DVD in my friend's TV, and it kept skipping. I tried it on my computer and in my own TV, and it said that there wasn't a disc in there. What's going on? Why won't it work?"
3,The Movie is good for kids 2-10 and is Goofy for people 11up,The Rugrats Movie is Stupid and Funny And Good
3,The movie was for younger kids...but ok,"it isn't as good as everyone says it is, but my lilttle cousins liked i"
5,An amazing animated film! Nick should be proud of what they accomplished!,"I remember that when I was a little kid, Nickelodeon, PBS Kids, Fox Kids, and Cartoon Network were my life. (Cow & Chicken, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Bobby's World, Blue's Clues, and especially Rugrats). I always was a fan of Rugrats and knew that someday, they'd get a movie and I was right. I remember seeing this film on Pay-per-view in the fall of '98 at a hotel in San Diego, CA and I enjoyed it from start to finish. Excellent animation and songs make this a good film. Tommy gets a new baby brother, Dylan Prescott Pickles (or Dil, played by Tara Strong), and things go off-course for the Pickles family and their friends. Plus, Tommy's dad has a new invention: the Reptar Wagon (""The ultimate in child's transportation!"", ""The perfect children's toy!"") and the babies go off with it into one of the biggest adventures of their infant lives.Overall a good film for kids and nostalgic teens and adults."
2,If You Dont Like The Show Then You Wont Like The Movie,"I am not a fan of rugrats but this one wasnt so bad.When i went to go see it in the theaters,the little kids did not find it good,They where jumping all over the place and wouldnt stay in there seats(same for the second one).Older people will find the Baby humor immature and stupid(i found out by experience).This movie does get annoying but is cute at times.Bottom line RENT IT because its not that good!"
1,Obnoxious!,"Well I am a fan of The Rugrats, those babies are so cute so I watched this movie and though the movie had a couple of funny parts it was only marginally and it's mostly a boring movie and just way too loud and obnoxious and doesn't live up the the hoopla it received from critics and doesnt live up to the Nickeleodeon TV show!If you want to get a splitting headache than watch this movie but if you dont want to get a splitting headache from all the loud noises in this movie that avoid like the plague!Watch the TV show instead. The original episodes and not the new ones with the horrible Dil and Kimmie who totally ruined the Rugrats!"
1,Absoulute stupidity on the highest level,"This movie is so stupid. It is about these bratty kids getting lost in a forest. Not a good tpic for an hour-plus movie. The voices of the characters were so annoying, I thought I would go deaf. The characters are stupid little brats who should be discplined more. Oh, and the babies got out of the forest (very prediciable). The humor was horribly infantile, I didn't laugh once. SPARE YOUR SANITY AND DO NOT SEE THIS MINDLESS DRIVEL!"
2,Don't watch it with your kids,"The animation in this movie is an improvement over the televised series, the voice talent is good, the plot is solid-and I hate this movie. I cannot tolerate the body fluid/noise humor, the screaming and squalling of the kids, and the mamby pamby parents. But my daughter cannot get enough of this. She watches it at least once a week, and it never fails to delight her."
1,I wish I can give it 0 stars!!!!!,"This movie stinks! The babies voices are so annoying! The plot was so bad, a bunch of kids getting lost in the forest. It was so overdramatic too. Tommy screaming for his mommy. BOO-HOO. This movie is a big flop and should have never been made."
1,THE T.V PROGRAM WAS WAY BETTER THAN THIS,I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS PATHETIC. IT IS JUST SO BORING AND BORING I FELL ASLEEP DURING THIS FILM. I THINK THE PARENT TRAP IS THE BEST FILM IN ALL THE WORLD NOW SO WHAT'S COMING OVER ME? STICK WITH THE T.V PROGRAM.
1,BAD Go see Hey Arnold the movie or Thomas and the Magic R.R.,"This is the worst film I ever seen at the movies. Do not take your child to see this... This movie is all about the babies get lost in the worlds. They decided to make the Reptar wagon. Tommy saves his retarted brother Dil, but Chuckie starts to drown; he soon gets rescued. They get found again. The end. I am a big fan of Rugrats. If I were you I would go see the June Nick Flick ""Hey Arnold! the movie"". The Rugrats Movie is more worst than Thomas and the Magic Railroad. I like that one and Hey Arnold."
1,"Um, Excuse Me, But Is It Possible To Give A Zero Star Rating","OK, now, if you are actually THINKING about taking a peek at this movie, DON'T!!!! This film is Rated G!!!!! What were the MPAA thinking???? There's this scene in a hospital where all these babies ... into the air to form a rainbow, and one where devil child ""Dil"" ... all over the babies while they're changing him. This is rated G????? I think that noone above the age of 2 should see this!!! I was 7 when I went to see it (although I didn't want to) and I was embarresed!!!! It's SOOOOOOOOOO BAD!!!! So, I think you shouldn't see this. If you want a good movie, go and see Halloween."
4,Pretty good movie based on the Nickelodeon series,"The Rugrats movie was fairly good. It was better than alot of animated movies. It was about Tommy,Chuckie,Phil,Lil, and the new baby,Dil. So the parents are giving Dil lots of attention and then the babies decide to take him back to the hospital to get their money back. They take Stu's new wacky invention called the Reptar Wagon. And on their way they get lost in the woods and facing obstacles on their way. Like I said it was fairly good for a kid's movie. I gave 4 stars out of 5"
2,Bad!!,"This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Between the annoying sound track of the babies singing...... and the very thin and boring plot, this movie was horrible. It begins when Didi has a baby named Dil, and they get lost in the woods on the border of town (which I am sure did not exist in the show)and they try to find their way back. The Grown-ups save them. The end. It was one of the most predictable story plot I have ever heard.If I were you, I'd skip this one, and see Rugrats in Paris, unless you are a huge Rugrats fan."
4,Rugrats the Movie,"It's a wild ride as expected. Definitely requiresparental guidance for the preschool to preteen set.Would recommend for the non-prudish, healthy family."
2,A Horrible Movie!,This movie is terrible. The songs stunk and the overall plot was not well thought out. I gave it the first star because you had too and gave the second star because baby Dil was cute.
2,Well it's for kids right?,"I agree with Roger Eberts Review in which case Old and Young Love the Rugrats, The old try to hide it but they still do.The problem is Rugrats Movie does go directly more for kids, and it would be in my words over shadowed by the greatness of it's sequel.It represents itself as more of a musical and frankly that was just annoying for me."
3,"Rugrats ""good"" but not ""all that""","For customers who want to check out this movie, take my advice. I'm only a 10-year old boy but I have some of the good and no-goods about this movie to tell you.First of all, a movie needs a plot. Where is it in this one?Next, you'll find the seires is a little better than the movie.You'll find that Nickeloedeon has improved making movies over the years.There were too many previews, however, there was a pretty funny bonus short.Last but not least, please rent before you buy so you can check it out."
1,BLEACHH..HURL!...I think I'm okay...,"Basiclly, this movie STUNK!!! It was one of the worst movies I've seen. This features the STUPID Dil and all he did was wail. I thought I was going to hurl. Anyone who thinks this is good is weird... PS.This was dumb it had no plot and BORING Like I'm going to see this again! I'll die of 'Cardiac Arrest'HURL!"
5,The Rugrats Rule!,THE RUGRATS HAVE MADE A POPULAR SINCE 1996 & I THINK THE MOVIE & THE TV SHOWS ARE THE NICER.
2,Where is the plot?,"I don't understand why this film gets 5 stars. This film isn't very exciting, it donsn't have a very good plot and when your 10 years old about half way through you'll realize that it isn't going anywhere. anouther porblem I have with the film is that at the begging you see the babys smach in to a window-wall, that part is totaly unneed! Plus the drama is realy bad as well as the animation theres something wroung with if, I think it has something to have to do with it being darker animation then the show and it more rufe anaimation. I hape Rugrats in Paris is better."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!,"The reason why I wanted to see this movie was because I like the rugrats so much. When I saw this movie, I was so disappointed. What annoyed me about this movie were the songs. The song ""Take Me There"" by Blackstreet and Mya did a lousy job in singing it. Don't waste your money on this trash, it has no point."
5,Great history we need to preserve,"Marcia Gallo's look at early lesbian rights pioneers is exceptional and it contains information we need to know and hand down to ""our"" younger generations. The book is fascinating and important.Fay JacobsAuthor of For Frying Out Loud - Rehoboth Beach Diaries"
1,The smell of this cologne reminds me of ...,The smell of this cologne reminds me of an older man. It isn't a smell that a younger man (under 55) in my opinion would wear. It just doesn't have the fresh smell that I would expect a man to have. It almost reminds me of an old man sitting in a bar.
2,Cheesey Wisk,"This is not a very good wisk. The loops are uneven and the chrome hasp on the cheap wooden handle is thinly and unevenly plated. Is it worth ($) bucks? Maybe, but you could probably find a better one for not much more."
3,Good,"This is a good copyholder, all the metal parts are great but the plastic slider line guide did not work right out of the box: it will not stay in a straight line so the portion of copy that is supposed to viewed in the clear blue line falls down to the next line of copy- sooo frustrating that I do not use the line guide. So a great copy holder with a poor line gude equals only a good 3 star product because I did'nt get what I paid for in the end. If there is a another copyholder out there with a quality line guide, buy that one."
3,"Solid Metal, Cheap Accessories","The body is solid metal, a $2 or 3 value, and the accessories are cheap. The clip is cheap, the magnet is weak, the ""premium"" guide does not stay in line (not 90 degrees, has lots of wiggle). Less than a dollar's worth of accessories for an extra $20. Big plus: the unit folds up. Big minuses: poor engineering, Chinese quality control."
5,Fantastic NFL MUSIC!!,"As an NFL / Cowboy fan I can tell this is a box that every nfl film`s fan should had. Tremendous,magnificent, every sound, every chord will remind you Staubach, Lambert, The doom's day defense, Montana, Aikman, Emmith, The Iron curtain, The purpple gang, Stabbler, Bradshaw,Jim Brown, Unitas, Jerry Rice, etc.Don`t think twice go for it!!"
3,nice but...,"still alot of the classic music missing. if they think the later music stands up to the Sam Spence material,they better stop playing football without a helmet !"
3,"Finally, great music from NFL Films; discs 1-5.","It took a while for this great soundtrack music to be released. It stayed in the vault, so to speak, for years without any consideration that this great music should be released on CD. Just after the 1970 merger, NFL Films released these soundtracks on a total of four volume LP's while supplies lasted. They didn't. I was excited when I learned this collection was finally available and I know this music quite well. While this collection is still not complete, the best music here can be found on CD's 1-5. But, CD's 6-10 sounds all pretty much the same -- boring, unless you're big into movie score music. I'm not."
4,Missing season,The CD's are wonderful but the brochure that comes with the product indicates that the 1975 season is included. The 1975 Season Suite was totally missing. The rest of the CD's were great but there was one particular piece that I was looking for and it happens to be included in the '75 season.
3,Autumn Thunder,"As a long time fan of NFL Films and its music, I recommend this collection ONLY for the hardcore NFL Films fanatic. If you like the music, purchase ""The Power and the Glory""- it's a lot cheaper and is an excellent compilation."
5,An insightful walk thru God's Word for real life change,"James is just as candid with his writing as he is in speaking. He is a conversational writer that gets to the point and his points are always well poised. If you are looking for biblical instruction that is easily applied to your life, this is a read for you. I've taught numerous sermons based upon this writing and would recommend it to anyone seeking life change based on Godly principles."
5,"I Really Want To Change...So, Help Me God","If you are really serious about changing with God's help, this is the book for you."
4,Great book on Biblical change,"I did not read the entire book but what I read was really good. James MacDonald addresses change from a Biblical standpoint spoken in everyday language and spoken as a pastor to his congregation. This is not a highly technical or hard to understand read. For that I'd recommend Jim Berg's book ""Changed into His Image"" which is what I read in a seminary class on Christian discipleship. Ovrall a great read written by a great man of God, pastor James MacDonald."
5,8-ball Rocks,"I love these guys. I see them every weekend here on Okinawa and I must say they are awsome. ""All for you"" is by far one of their best tracks. This is deffinently a great buy. You will want to listen to them over and over again. 8-Ball Rocks"
2,Dreams,"George Fraser is bored and lonely. He prefers his dream world to his real, ordinary life so he begins to boast about it, pretending that he is, in fact, a hardened and ruthless gangster. But George Fraser boasts to the wrong people and suddenly his dream world becomes all too real. But he has exciting dreams. In his dreams, he lives in a thrilling world of gangsters, guns, fast cars and beautiful women. And of course, in his dreams, he is the toughest gangster of them all. Obviously, when a dream comes true, the dreamer is expected to be happy, but tragically, Fraser has to be worried and sad for his dreams coming to limelight because he never knew things could turn sore even as a gangster living in a gangster paradise; he forgot to ask Coolio before consult chase for his dreams. It is an intelligent and harshly revealing piece of work with not a little serious penetration and power."
5,"Strong story, wonderful romance","I really enjoyed this romance novel. The characters have strengths and flaws and quirks, just like people you know in real life. Although they're attracted to each other, they have real conflicts keeping them apart, things they can't fix easily with a conversation. I've stayed away from series romances in recent years because they kept disappointing me. Not this time. I'm going to keep an eye out for more books from Margaret Watson."
2,Idiosyncratic performances,"I wish I loved this set (composed if this and another separate CD) of Vivaldi's 12-concerti group called Il Cimento dell'Armonia e dell'Inventione.But I hate it. The performances seem so self-importantly stylized and idiosyncratic, and the sound, which is highly touted as being recorded in ""24-bit, 96Khz"" resolution, is very grating and annoying, with little bass and highly accentuated upper frequencies. I love this set of concertos but I greatly dislike this recording and performance of them, I'm sorry to say."
4,Handy Little Item,"This FM Modulator (VRFM6) does not have all the ""Bells & Whistles"" the much higher priced model (VRFM9) does. It does not allow you to play your music by inserting a SD card or a USB flash drive. It does not display shows song titles, artist, album and genre and ID3 date tags. And, it does not include controls for random/shuffle mode, last song played and last song memory, either. I can only assume that your own MP3 players does all this already !!!!!!!!What it does do (at a far better price) is allow you to plug your own MP3 player, CD player and/or DVD players into it's audio input to wirelessly hear high-quality music through your car's FM radio. And it does it very well. What else can you ask for or what else do you need ??????Great Item !"
2,Just install a new audio player!,I had heard poor reviews of even the more expensive FM transmitters so decided to try out this cheaper one. But the sound quality is really poor and was no fun at all. I stopped using it within a day. I am planning to install a new Audio system with Aux input instead. You get good ones starting from 70-odd $. And u can have it installed for another 40$ from Frys.
2,Very Noisy,"This thing works ok, but in my opinion is really substandard. There is constant audible static on all channels. I have tried it on 2 different car stereos and the results are always the same. If you are listening to loud music and driving on the highway, the background noise may cover up the constant static, otherwise you are going to hear it. I wrote to tech support and they could not help. It seems the product I received is simply a poor one. If you want something cheap and don't care too much about quality then it might be worth getting. If you are picky about sound quality I don't recommend it. All of these FM transmitters will somewhat diminish the quality of the music compared to havening a direct connection to your stereo anyway."
1,not worth the .99 paid for it.,"i am using this for an htc hero. I had the same brand product, but different model (was a charger and adaptor) and it worked great. A fluke happening broke the wire connector and rendered it useless. This product does not compare to the other. the music is garbled and sometimes doesn't play until i adjust the connectors to be just right. The connector has different ends so I can't even use it on my previous product."
5,cheap the best,"i had this item before, about 5 years ago! i tried more expensive ones but, somehow vr3 worked the best, for the money that it costs u cant go wrong,i like this cheap one!"
1,Perfect for listening to static...,The old saying that you get what you pay for is definitely true here. Unless you really enjoy listening to background static this device is not for you. I tried literally every frequency and never received anything close to clear or enjoyable music.
4,"Great product, especially at this price!","This is actually a great product for the price paid. It does not have any ""bells and whistles"", but it is very easy to use, small, inexpensive, and has very good sound quality, contrary to the other reviews I have read. When I initially plugged it in, I heard a lot of the static others have mentioned. All I had to do to get rid of that was turn the volume way down on my MP3 player and then turn the volume up on my stereo. No more static."
4,Not bad at all.,"I bought this little device about a year ago. I use it with the mp3 player on my LG Chocolate phone. The sound quality is really decent, considering it is coming through the radio. It has a lot more channels than some of the more expensive transmitters, and I am able to use it with a non-iPod mp3 player. I recommend it if you don't have an iPod, or even if you do, want to save approximately $30."
3,Pleasure first albums,What happened to the song.....living without you. That was a hit. anybody know what album that was? Help a pleasure fan.Eloy villarreal
4,Knife Edge by Douglas Reeman,A very good read. Reeman has done extensive research into the Boxer movement in China at the beginning of the 20th century. The action is swift and the characters well defined. Conflicts abound in plenty and are resolved in a logical manner. A typical work from a master story teller.
2,disappointing,"I have read over a score of books by this author and really like the writing. This book, however, is all over the place, is hard to follow, and most assuredly is not anywhere near as well written as the rest. If I had it to do again, I'd skip this title."
4,Amazing Music and Performance!,"Reading the reviews on this DVD I was prompted to buy it, and boy am I glad I did! Thank you for the initiation to Shawn Lane! I must have been living under a rock to have missed this incredible virtuoso.Having been a longtime fan of Shakti I grew quite enchanted with the heavy Indian influenced sound so for me this was a no brainer, but it actually surpassed my expectations. This is one great performance!The DVD itself has two sets (chapters) that must be individually started, so make sure you watch both. Do not miss the incredible guitar work of Shawn Lane on the first cut of the second set.Evidently the audio is stereo rather than 5.1 (I see no audio options) but it is very clear and clean. The editing and video quality are both very good but not excellent, thus my 4 out of 5 stars."
4,"Weak, but tasty!","This product met my expectations very well. The flavor wasn't quite what I expected, however. I expected a cinnamon flavor with subtle hints of hazelnut and vanilla. Instead, I found that all three flavors are pretty evenly distributed. The end result is a cacophony of flavors which is very powerful and distracts from the natural coffee flavor.The beans themselves are rather small. Because of this, I think, the coffee is rather weak. I find myself having to use 30% more coffee per pot than with my traditional coffee beans. The cup, when poured black, has a very weak color to it, if you add creamer the look is very reminiscent of tea with milk.When I first tried the coffee I was very unhappy with the results. However, after tweaking the amount of grounds I use (as well as increasing the coarseness of my grounds) I found a product that was palatable.Would I buy it again? Probably not. However, I can see many people who dislike strong coffee truly enjoying this."
4,great tiny book,This book is very small. I was able to stick it in my purse and read it when I was waiting for somethig in public. Her writing is a little jumbled sometimes but she helps with a deeper understanding of this fierce mother ad more than just Kali the destroyer. But as Kali the mother.
3,OK but not a good selection of titles,"This is an OK compilation of Easter Themed songs but included some that didn't make much sense; e.g. Sugar, Sugar?????Audio quality is OK."
2,Good shoe goes Bad,"I've worn the Tommy Hilfiger flag shoe for years and liked them. But, this time I am disappointed. The shoe has gone cheap. The leather is cheaper, the flag symbol is sewn differently and less stylish. The insole is glued on, so can't easily be removed to place sole inserts. This will be the last pair of Hilfiger shoes I buy. They've obviously changed materials and construction to cut costs, and it shows."
4,a nice surprise!,"I didn't know much about Sondre when I picked up the album, but I was pleased with what I heard - simply, if you enjoy melodic pop music - stuff like the Shins, Belle and Sebastian, etc. than buy this - I'm gonna check out his debut album because I found this to be rewarding."
5,absolutely breathtaking,"I LOVE this cd to death. Sondre Lerche is a dreamy genious and I wish I had heard of him sooner. His music is so unique and original, his lyrics are touching and his melodies are beautiful. Not to bash Hilary Duff or Lindsay Lohans ""music careers"", but they are so generated and fake. They do not write their songs, they barely even sing on them, all they need to do is lip sync. Sondre Lerche wrote all of his songs, and he says they come from his heart, from his past experiences. His voice..... how can I describe it? Its wonderful, a handsome velvety voice. He is also VERY easy on the eyes if you know what I mean. Every song on this cd took my breath away, and I really hope to see him live in the future! His energy is so amazing, He's fantastic."
3,I like it,"I listen to a lot of music and I like this CD. I don't like most CD's I listen to. It's not amazing, but track two was one of those songs that I liked in the first few seconds (which is rare). It's worth buying."
3,Good but not great,"This is an alright cd but let's face it Beck did it much better not too long ago with Sea Change. Sondre is pleasant in a non-threatening kind of way while Sea Change was one of the most emotional albums of the last ten years. No disrespect but maybe he didn't realize it when he made this disc, no one will ever know."
5,great album,"This is my personal favorite album of this year. I was lucky enough to catch him on his very limited US tour and even got to meet him and have him autograph my copy of his first album ""Faces Down."" He is as elegant and well spoken in person as in any recording. He is a one man force from Norway who is slowly gaining a US audience. His music is engaging, empowering, insightful and full of youthful zeal. ""Faces Down"" and ""Don't Be Shallow"" met with well deserved critcal acclaim and so has ""Two Way Monolouge."" You will find ""Two Way Monolouge"" filled with infectious, life affirming songs that will stick with you like a good breafast. Lerche weaves his songs from catchy Beatle-like melodies to sophisticated sounds like Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello into his own notable and worthy voice.If you don't have ""Monolouge"" yet I implore you get going and buy it. He's here to stay. Thank God!"
1,Poems about fat grandmas and baby poo,"There are great books about -- and for -- babies and toddlers out there, with appropriate, enriching vocabularies and great humor. This isn't one of them. Try books my Mo Willems, Shel Silverstein or Anna Dewdney if you want fun stuff for kids this age...This thing was given to us as a gift. Thank God, because man, I wouldn't buy it."
1,Save your money,"I purchased one of the larger step cans, and it seemed like a really nice trash can, but after only two months of use, the step-opening mechanism broke. Turns out the whole trash can is metal, but the important parts that make it open are made of brittle plastic! How frustrating to have spent so much on a trash can only to have it break within 2 months! I would not recommend this brand at all!"
2,Cavernous and Cold Sound,The sound in this recording of the Organ Concerto is cavernous and cold. You could feel the vastity of Notredame. It lacks inmediacy. The organ is in the foreground but the orchestra sounds remote. Many orchestral details are lost. The percusion reverberates from far away.
5,Mary Loves It!!,We have this bag and my girl Mary LOVES IT!! Keeps us warm and toasty!!Go Jeff!! Tony Stewart will never compare!
4,Fun but buggy,The game is an excellent reproduction of the television show with all the bells and whistles. Two big problems: 1. Final Jeopardy sometimes jumps to the endof the music before you finish answering and you lose the game. 2. You can never get to the tournament of champions. You are supposed to qualify if you earn $100K but you never get in!Had fun but was frustrated for obvious reasons.
1,not worth the spin,This is not the spinner that I had anticipated. Disappointing purchase. The delivery was fine. The product is not worth it. Similar ones can be found at low price stores. It would not even serve as a re-gift due to its poor quality.
2,Gears Slip,"This was a replacement for the same exact item that I bought over 10 years prior. On the one I was replacing, the plastic interior basket was starting to fall apart but the exterior was fine. The new one is made much more cheaply - the gears in the top slip *a lot* and doesn't spin smoothly. Luckily, I kept the old one and just swapped out the lid."
4,Good for my Needs,"What I like about this salad spinner is that the bottom is nicely open so the water can drain out without the lettuce sitting in the water getting soggy. It's also easy to clean and have found it does well in the top rack of my dishwasher using air dry.What I don't like is the water sprays back up at you as you're pouring it in the hole from the faucet and spinning it, and the crank handle can sometimes be picky and you have to hold it just right while spinning it or it gets stuck. I think some people will probably get frustrated with that, but since I don't use it but maybe once a week it's not an issue for me and the lettuce and greens come out very clean and nice and crisp like I want. I even bought my mother in law one so we can now have sandwiches over at her house without dripping wet lettuce."
3,Settling for Least . . .,"As an old homemaker, mother of large family, and professional woman, I've had this product for quite a while, after my wondrous Tupperware product was permanently borrowed away. This product is marginal at best; if anyone has used the better products, they'd concur. But, the better ones are grossly overpriced, and frankly not worth the investment. There is a lettuce spinner/keep that is great - but frankly, my old Tupperware product kept our lettuce fresh and crisp for eons!At some point, we have to realize that constantly purchasing over-priced products does nothing to help our quality of life. An equal outcome may be reached by wrapping washed greens in fresh water, and wrapping them in a cotton towel, inserting them into an old plastic newspaper bag will keep everything nice, green, and crisp for a long time, without expensive ""SPINNING.""Would I buy this product, again? Nope."
2,spinner disappointment,I have had one of these salad spinners previously and loved it; however this one is a disappointment. The plastic cover doesn't stay on the lid making it difficult to get the basket to spin. Not sure what I am doing wrong - had no difficulties with my previous one.
4,Pretty good for 5 bucks...,"Also from Wal-Mart. A little contrary. Sometimes you have to realign the lid/driver to get it to spin. If you apply too much torque the drive knob/handle pops loose, but it pops right back on. So far it stands up to daily use/abuse (7 days now) without failure. I am a little worried about its longevity...so far so good. Good for infrequent use but if you are like me, a daily user, you may want to invest in a better, more durable design."
3,Compact salad spinner,"I returned the gigantic OXO because it was too large and cumbersome. The Progressive is compact and the water runs through as you spin, so you get to do 2 actions in 1. Saves time and space. A little on the frail size, so you have to use caution and not abuse it. Had one years ago and received the OXO as a replacement. Never liked it. Happy to be back with the Progressive."
3,all the things you lurve,"considering that it was one of the few strong tracks off of Kill Uncle, ""Sing Your Life"" was a good choice for lead off single. the tune is lovely and carries a feeling of long lost single that could have been penned by someone like Buddy Holly. ""That's Entertainment"" is a cover song (originally performed by The Jam); and Morrissey turns it into a nice acoustic piece. the final track ""The Loop"" is an ok track that doesn't offer much; but is a nice little song with a decent hook. a fitting b-side, then. cheers."
5,A must have album for any rock fan,"As a long standing Kim Mitchell fan, this is his best offering. There is not a dud song on this album. A great mix of ballad-like songs and toe tapping rock beats. Kim is a genius guitar player and this album is a classic. If you ever have a chance to catch him in concert don't miss it."
3,Strong perfume,"While it is a good pre-shave, it has a very strong perfume that my wife cannot stand. CVS drugstores have a clone with a less strong perfume."
2,"War , what is it good for?","I respect the men (and women) who fought for truth, justice and the American way, and gave thier lives. But this documentary is more suited to cable tv than a DVD release.I admit it is often tear-jerking to hear the reminiscing of the old veterans and what they went through, but it gets a tad dull and boring. The same message of the futility of war can be found in Saving Private Ryan, which is more exciting as an added bonus.I do NOT recommend this title, catch it on TV, save your pennies and buy some other DVD."
4,"Go Bes 16 Lovers Lane, at least 4.5 stars, Amazon, 0 stars","For those of you trying to figure out whether the Lo-Max and EMI releases are the same, they are. Because of Amazon's annoying habit of copying reviews from one CD or DVD into another more recent release, sometimes by a different and superior company (I am thinking of Criterion here), this is sometimes hard to figure out.As to 16 Lover's Lane, I like it a lot. That is why I bought it. Given that art and value are in the social and cultural eyes of the beholder not everyone will like it. I hope we never live in a world where such autonomic responses are common."
5,Beautiful,"This album is nothing short of outstanding, Yes, Outstanding. Most people when I talk to them about the Go-Betweens they say Go-Who.This is rotten shame as this is one of best acoustic pop albums from the 80's.Highlights include:Streets of your town (Amazing car radio song)Quiet HeartDive for you MemoryFans of good pop music will love this. Also check out Tallulah and the slow burner Liberty Belle.A bit of Trivia.1.John Wilstead plays the magnificant nylon string solo in Streets of your town2.All their albums from Liberty Belle to 16 Lovers lane contained LL's in the title cause the band thought this would help them become as successful as MichaelJackson's thriller, True !!"
2,"Some fun puzzles, but not much else","I would have given it two and a half stars, but I'll have to give it two. There are some fun puzzles in this game, but it lacks a lot.One -- some of the puzzles are badly unoriginal. The worst example of this is a player piano that imitates the game ""Simon"", where you have to remember the tune and play it back. Other puzzles almost repeat themselvesTwo -- the puzzles do not interact with the game play at all. The game is basically just a walkthrough movie, with puzzles here and there to solve so that you can make it to the next part of the movie. In this respect, it is somewhat like the game ""Fool's Errand""Three -- the animation moves too darn slow in the puzzles. When you click on a move, the characters or icons on the screen move annoyingly slow.Overall though, if you buy it cheap off the rack, it will be worth it for you. But it is still not a great game at all."
2,If you like chess...,When this game first came out it was outstanding. We have come along way since then. The story is very weak. There are way too many puzzles closely resembling chess. The piano puzzle is overdone and the Basement maze is from hell itself-even with hints. The scenes are gross but fun. It is fun watching the scenes unravel eventually. It is a nice house.
4,Very Good and Very Entertaining,"The only thing this game lacked was more development in the graphics and story. Other than that, some of the puzzles made my brain hurt. Seriously, this is one of the better games I have played (I own fifty), buy it you won't be disappointed!"
4,Looking for brainteasers and an erie storyline too?,"The 7th guest is a game recommended to those interested in an on-going mystery filled with games and clues needed to solve the mystery of such a haunted mansion. It's a great game, glues me to my computer."
3,It was fun&#65533;,"...for about 3.5 hours, then I just tossed it in the back ofmy closet, please, I beg you, for the human race, this game isn'tworth [the price], it's not even worth it if it was for free! The graphics and gameplay are old (1993 style), puzzles are difficult and also a sad introduction to the game!"
2,Boring,"The 7th Guest has a good premise, but the inability to escape out of boring (and useless) dialog is almost enough to make me cry in frustration. The games are fun enough, but it takes so long to get through the introductory chatter (which replays every time you need to start a particular game over to get it right) that it's almost not worth it."
1,Not USA Made as Described,"The Amazon description of this item indicates that it is made in Oregon (""handcrafted in Oregon"") - - this was the reason I ordered it.When it arrived, the handle is clearly marked ""Stainless China"" and manufacturers name that I can not decipher, but it is clearly not Best Manufacturers.There is a major disconnect, deceit or some manner of 'bait & switch"" - - or a combination thereof.Added Comment: Within an hour of the initial review, the supplier M V Trading, responded and thru Amazon, returned my payment and acknowledged errors in their listing."
2,Unimpressed,"Pretty flimsy. Looks good from the images, but I wouldn't buy this again. I think I'll stick to buying items like these from a physical store so I really know what I'm gettin."
5,Great Whisk!,This is a very sturdy whisk. I can't imagine this ever falling apart. Great price. Dishwasher friendly is a big plus as well!
2,Wire whisk review,The wire whisk is a bit flimsy but does work ok. Was hoping it was a bit stiffer. There is no way to tell when ordering on the internet. It will work for me but I may look for another whisk to have on hand for stiffer batters.
5,"Fine performances, pretty good recording","This was the Bothy Band's final album, recorded on a tour of Europe shortly before the band imploded and its members went on to other things. While many of the tracks will be familiar to those who have heard their other albums, the performances are excellent and there are some nice surprises (""The Death of Queen Jane"" is a stunner). The quality is generally good for a live recording -- which is to say, not up to studio level, but still eminently listenable. A worthy addition to anyone's Irish music library."
4,Good But Could Be Better,"This is a well-written book and worthwhile for what it contains, but what it does not include is inexplicable. What about Ada, Queen City of the Chicksaw Nation? It's on the map in the book (as it should be) but no mention of it whatsover in the text. This lovely town is important to Oklahoma's history and worth a visit with its many historic buildings and turn-of-the-century downtown."
3,Discs sloppily put together,I've always wanted to learn to paint and when I found Bob Ross's dvd's here I decided this was the time.The picture quality is very good but some of the episodes on disc 1 are repeated on disc 2 instead of the episodes listed . Disc 3 has episodes different than what is listed on the box and even on the disc. It's like it was put together by somebody who didn't know or care what they were doing .But at least there are enough episodes for me to have the Joy Of Painting .
5,Best bilingual dictionary out there.,"I have been studying foreign languages (Spanish and Italian) for over 15 years. I have purchased many dictionaries along the way and I have to say this is one of the best! Being a visual learner, this book is one of the most helpful dictionaries out there. Now, I would still recommend having a standard bilingual dictionary which will always be more comprehensive, but to help build a strong working vocabulary this book is perfect."
5,GOOD,I bought it for my American boyfriend who lives in Vegas.He is so happy couse it is a great DICTIONARYRoberto
3,cheap pads and brake lever,"pros:calipers are sturdy and solid with little wobble or squeal. Plenty of reach. brake cable housing is wire reinforced and plenty long. Includes ferule for the ends.cons:cheapest, lightweight plastic brake lever you can imagine. brake lever is for right hand only, unless you install it upside down. pads have mediocre grip. useless on slippery rim walls. Had to buy Koolstop dual compound bmx pads."
2,Pyramid Mx1000 bike brake,"The brakes themselves are O.K., but, the adjustment screws and the cable clamp parts are not the best. I wouldn't get them again."
2,Disappointing Tank,Each of my two sons received a tank from their Grandparents. Great toy until the tracks broke. After just a few weeks of use they broke into several pieces and cannot be repaired. Kids do not play with them anymore because they do not move. Very disappointing.
2,Not Rugged At All,"Bought as an Xmas gift, by June all the sections of the trackshave separated. Tank is just a thing that makes noise now.No idea how to repair the treads, won't move without them."
3,Robot parts,"I bought this toy to take it apart and use the treads and motors for my newest robot, (however I did play with it a bit first HeeHee!) it looks like it built very rugged, it should hold up well."
1,terrible: small and not comprehensive,"This is my 2nd and last Rand McNally plastic fold-out map. The print is too tiny.For this Virginia Beach map, I got it for my vacation, and it doesn't even cover the beach area. I was hoping it would reach down to Sandbridge to the south, but the coverage didn't even come close."
4,Great with Silicon Hydragel contacts!,"Unlke Lawyer Girl, I really like this product. Perhaps her issue was using the solution with normal contact lenses, but I switched to a 'new' contact material (silicon hydragel) in the Acuvue Advance contacts and use this with it. The combination is spectacular! I can wear my contacts for nearly 20 hours without any problems, when I used to have to take them out after no more than 10."
4,Popular Tales from Norse Mythology,"Just a warning to those fooled by the title: Don't expect to find any mention of Odin of Thor in this book. Rather than mythology, the stories in the book would be more appropriately described as folktales or perhaps even fairy tales. Most involve a fair maiden in distress who is rescued by a ""once-was-a-peasant-found-a-magic-belt-or-met-a-troll-and-became-a-knight"" type of hero.Nevertheless, I greatly enjoyed the book. As the author says, the folktales in _Popular Tales from Norse Mythology_ are overall good reading. They are full of excitement and adventure and a great deal of humour. These factors probably made it possible for the stories to survive as Scandinavian oral tradition until they were finally written down in the last century.Although the book rarely mentions Norse gods directly, a number of characters can be identified as one of the old gods, particularly Odin, slipping into an overall Christianized story. I found that interesting."
4,Good Video Overview,"""Consider the Sea"" is a good video overview of this major 19th Century American author for high school and undergraduate college students of literature. The viewer gets to see many key faces and places from Melville's life, and excerpts from his works are dramatically and vividly presented.It's a bit ""PBS"", but I'd recommmend this video to any rookie Melville fan."
1,Piece of Crap-Don't Buy It.,"I have seen Girls Gone Wild advertised for years now. Once, while watching late night television, I watched an ad for Guys Gone Wild. I went ahead and purchased the video from Amazon. What a waste of money! I can't believe I actually paid to watch this crap. I can't imagine what I was expecting, but disappointment was the emtion I was left feeling. This truly gives credence to the phrase, ""A fool and his money will soon part."" I may be a little poorer, but wiser nonetheless."
4,Quilters: Try something different,"This book is great for the quilter who would like to try a different technique. The author gives helpful, concise, and not commonly known directions for working with wool. She advises the reader on where to find good wool, how to prepare wool, how to quilt with wool, and includes many wonderful patterns and designs that adapt well to wool. The sample quilts are folk-like in design and fairly easy for a beginner to accomplish. It is a book I will keep for reference."
2,Crossword puzzel,"The shipping was fast. The box was worn around the edges so it could not be given as a gift even though the item was ""new"". The refund was quick and hassel free."
4,8 years of fun,"I have loved this piece of software as much as any I have owned. NYT Crosswords from 1986-1994 are in this package. While, as the last reviewer pointed out, there are typos that will frustrate you, the brilliance of the NYT crossword puzzles shine. I have spent many a happy hour and only a few frustrated minutes on the puzzles.This package can be found relatively cheaply and provide many hours of enjoyment. I would have given 5 stars except for the typos."
3,A Few Good Movies,"Aim for the Werner Herzog Collection instead. I deeply admire the work and breadth of Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski. Their best films together, in my opinion, are Aguirre: The Wrath of God and Fitzcarraldo. The others are dispensable and forgettable. I'll give a rating for the movies included:0 out of 4Aguirre: The Wrath of God ***1/2Fitzcarraldo ***1/2Nosferatu **Woyzeck **Cobra Verde **My Best Fiend ***1/2Nosferatu suffered severely from blandness throughout. It didn't add anything to the original, just a pointless remake of a great film. Woyzeck was dull and overwhelmingly boring. Cobra Verde, borderline incoherence and, too, incredibly dull. I figure that this is not a bad deal considering the separate purchase of Aguirre, My Best Fiend and Fitzcarraldo would equate to the cost of this entire collection. Like I said before, buy the Werner Herzog Collection instead."
2,Meh,"I found most of these movies boring save the one about the boat and the one about the vampire. Those two were not quite worth the price of box set, but I would buy them again as standalone features."
4,Kinski is the Star...,"Overall, an excellent box set. Beautiful transfers. My preferences among the six films are for ""Aguirre"", ""Woyzeck"" and the documentary ""My Best Fiend"". I had seen ""Nosferatu"" at the time of its original release. The first version by Murnau from 1922 (available on a Kino DVD) is superior and even more frightening. ""Fitzcarraldo"" seems a little overlong. (I was checking the time on my watch!) I doubt that I will view it again. Regarding ""Woyzeck"": Herzog's film is quite faithful to Büchner's ""fragments"", and a treat for those who know or have seen staged versions of Alban Berg's opera ""Wozzeck"". Superb photography throughout."
4,Werner Herzog & Kaus Kinski - a winner,"The documentary is an absolutely fascinating look at the complex relationship between these two geniuses, and the movies themselves are a testament to the fact that you don't need vast special effects and copious quantities of money to produce movies which are riveting to watch. Huge risks were taken in the making of several of these movies by both actors and crew, and the results are stunning."
2,More of the same,"If you've played 7th Guest, you've played 11th Hour. It's the same house -- the same puzzles -- the same general story -- and most of the same actors. Did they think that adding more and better FMV cutscenes would disguise that? Puh-LEASE.The only really positive thing about the game is how much fun it is to wander through an abandoned house poking at things. The puzzles are all of the improbable chess-problem sort, and several of them require you to play against the computer, a situation that is not always winnable. Quite frustrating! especially since every wrong move you make gets you an insulting remark by the overacting villain. Add to it that the basic story is hopelessly contrived and silly, the ending unrewarding, and the neverending music boring and hokey, and ... well, I wouldn't call it a winner.If you're intrigued by ghost stories, go play 7th Guest. It's more fun and at least has the benefit of originality."
2,Pass it by - even at this price,"I liked the first game (7th Guest) a bit, mainly because the puzzles were so strong that it was fun. The acting was atrocious. The sequel is a bit like most movie sequels...not quite as interesting as the previous. The acting is still bad, the puzzles to some degree are almost identical in nature, and the storyline goes exactly nowhere. If you haven't played the 7th Guest, then maybe you'll like it, but I think I liked the music more on 7th Guest, so get that if you can."
1,Nothing but problems!,"I was very disappointed in the technical aspects of this game. I really enjoyed ""The 7th Guest"", and I thought that I would enjoy this one as well. Unfortunately, getting the disk to run was a MAJOR nightmare! After spending an hour and a half trying to get the game to start (the game required me to change and configure audio drivers, without giving any help doing it!), I was finally able to get it to go, but even then the sound was pretty much shot. Other problems I had with it: 1) it wouldn't remember the sound settings that took forever to change. When I would try to play the next time, I would have to ""uninstall"" the game and reinstall - losing any saved games! 2) The puzzles, when I could access them, were INSANELY hard! Without the help of a good cheat guide, forget it!All in all, it looked like it had potential but I would NOT recommend this to ANYONE! What were the designers thinking? Give me a game that I can just stick in and play!"
1,Oh Please,"Definitely this game had possibilities: decent story line, fair acting, but I was totally frustrated with the puzzles. Get on with the story already. If you're a Mensa genius buy it."
1,Agree with pass it by review from other buyer.,"No help from tech staff if you have a problem with installing disc, had to return faulty disc. Also messed up my computer, had to have help to straighten out my programs"
2,To Big,This iten is to large for any one I would think and it is way to soft it wasn't what I thought it would be
2,Not what I expected,"I was not happy with this item and was extremely shocked when I had to go to the post office to retrieve the item. If using as an adult toy, keep in mind, the item is somewhat heavy, limp or flimsy. The girth/width is alittle on the larger side. There was a bad odor to the product when it came out of the package. I was not impressed and this wasn't what I expected or ordered!"
1,Smelly!,"This item smells...and I dont mean just an odd oder, I mean it really smells. The smell remains anywhere this item has been. I have washed the sheets, the towels, the sofa cover, and the smell is still there! I came home from work and the whole house smelled! It is really bad. I do not recommend that anyone buys this product. I threw it in the trash."
4,It is definitely SUPER,"The product is slightly wider at the head than the shaft. If you're going to use it for anal, it may take a while to get used to it. However, now I find it to be just the right size. Maybe I'll get a bigger one ;)It has a suction base, which comes in handy when you want to ride it, but you can't move too wildy or it won't stick very well.The only con is the smell. Every time I break it out, it smells of rubber, and it's something that hasn't washed away with having it for over a month.Overall, it's a great toy, and I recommend it to all ... unless the smell of rubber makes you feel nauseated.Have fun!"
1,Not worth it.. even $2,"Recently bought it...too soft, too big , too smelly and can't return it so better stay away from it.so Journey of this rubber starts from Amazon warehouse to post office to my home to garbage can...God knows where it ends next..There goes my $17....Could have bought plenty of unripped banana for $17 and it comes all sizes and shapes ....;-)"
1,Made of rubber. Stinks. Burns when inserted.,"Positive: size and feel of this toy are good.However, I will never use it again. It is made of rubber and smells really bad. I cannot even store it in the same room where I sleep: the stench wakes me up, it is that bad.Another negative: I do not know the chemical composition of that rubber, but when I use it, it burns my insides... It feels like a chemical burn.Too cheap to return. Ended up in the trash."
5,Unbeatable U.S. made guitar,"I bought this guitar to tinker with. I have owned several acoustic guitars over the years, but none of them ever got much playing time. I have always preferred to play electric. Acoustics are (traditionally) too big, bulky and uncomfortable for me. I own a U.S. Paudak Washburn N4 and a custom U.S. Jackson Soloist SL2H and the 1778 gets as much or more playing time than both of them combined. The neck feels like a cross between an electric and a traditional acoustic. I absolutely love this guitar. The bass is tight and punchy and the highs are bright and true. This is the only acoustic I will ever need."
2,"Tacky, corny Danish pop band who should rather write songs f",Yucky pop music written and performed by a band who should write music for bOYZONE instead...Yuck
2,A little bit disappointing,"I am not a biologist, but an engineer interested in evolution and mathematics.The mathematics of the book is very easy, the only (very) confusing issue are the indices.The G-function is introduced a bit ad-hoc, but as a definition, this might not matter much. It is very clear, that by allowing the strategy to vary, one can get optimal (at least stationary) values. The strategy dynamics are introduced in a rather confusing way, without much of an explanation.For the rest, it seems, that 80% of the book are numerical examples, which seem to prove mostly, that with nonlinear differential equations, the behaviour of (e.g.) stationary points can vary quite a bit, if the coefficients in those equations are changed.Maybe a professional biologist gets a lot out of this book, but for the interested layman it offers little (except upteen numerical examples, see above)"
3,a dictionary of latin words and phrases,"This is an excellent quick review of Latin words and phrases. It is well arranged and even relates some of the phrases to famous Roman writers. For example, explaining malesuada Fames in terms of Virgil's Aeneid and his conception of Hell is excellent. So also is Seneca's ducunt volentem fata. There are many other references like these. Such references make it not just a dictionary of Latin words and phases but also a minor appreciation of Literature."
4,Book ordered from Amazon,"""A Dictionary of Latin Words and Phrases""was rather good. It definitely will help me in debates with friends and with my crossword puzzles."
2,Too focused on history,I thought I was purchasing a book that would help analyze and explore one's dreams. Instead the author describes how in history and how in the bible God used dreams to communicate with people.
1,Doesn't Fit all Bottom Brackets,"Be aware that this tool will only fit one size of crank bolt threading, I believe M15. There are other bottom brackets that this tool will not fit and will be completely useless. The product description should at least specify the threading size."
1,Poor CCG,"As a huge magic AND a huge WoW fan, I looked all over for this game thinking it would be the best of both worlds...unfortunately, it's the worst of both.Beware the HUGE imbalance of hero cards/decks in this game. It's obvious that the game was not properly put through its paces before it was run out the door. Upper Deck should be ashamed of the poor play-balancing.Outside of that complaint (which makes the game itself useless), the art is so-so compared to other CCGs and the rule-book absolutely ABYSMAL.Do yourself a favor and purchase a properly put-together CCG (I don't care which one you choose, just choose something other than Heroes of Azeroth)."
2,Completely inappropriate style,"I bought this CD hoping to learn more about Poulenc's piano music, since I am most familiar with the vocal works and chamber music. As it turns out, M. Cazal has no affinity for Poulenc's style, and I cannot listen to this disc for too long before I start to feel assaulted! Every attack is aggressive, there is no time for the music to breathe, some of the loud parts sound actually violent, and the phrasing can be so incredibly square that one gets the impression that the pianist actually resents Poulenc. Where is the humor, the finesse, the gentleness, the genuine passion, the poignancy? Truly disappointing."
2,OUTDATED,"Groff's book is simply outdated. It is no longer relevant. It is a mystery why the the National Guild of Professional Paperhangers uses it as a study guide for their ""Certified Paperhanger"" program. Although there are some valid points in the book, it is, as I stated, OUTDATED. If you need to learn how to hang paper, sure read this book, but then go work for a REAL paperhanger. This will not make you a competent wallcovering installer, nor should it be assumed a ""C.P."" has advanced skills."
3,Great resource,"This book is a great resource to find items in the Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament by Walter Bauer, I believe this edition fits the fourth edition. The binding does not hold up. Jesus' Blessings and Peace"
3,"Looks real nice, but it's average at best","Since there were no reviews here, I thought I'd assist you with some info. I strongly rely on reviews, so hopefully this one will help you.Apparently Amazon stopped selling my favorite bag clip by KitchenAid. It had a price tag of around $10.00 (ouch) but it was worth every penny. (nice looking, strong, large, and magnetic)So here I am, several weeks after using this bag clip by Progressive. It looks very nice, but it's not very functional. It does not have a magnet so I can stick it to my frig. The tension is far too weak but seems to work better on thicker items .... so I decided to use it as a clip to hold my upcoming bill envelopes. It does this just fine IF there are at least 6 envelopes stacked.Ultimately, I cannot give this product more than an average rating - even though it looks very nice.Cheers!Jeff"
4,Good shape - hard to use,"This cookie cutter makes snowmen exactly the way I want them shaped, and that was hard to find. The bad thing is that it's a little hard to use because it's a little sharp. I wanted my 9 year old to help make the cookies, but I had to cut them and then let her decorate."
4,Learning Jewish history,"With little knowledge about Jewish modern history, from the late 1700's, I've learned about the thinking of the Jews of this period. Through letters and documents, both from Jews and non-Jews, this book gives us an interesting insight into the minds of the people across Europe during these turbulent times. I used this book in a class I took and it is both informative and interesting."
4,Essential collection - BUT don't buy the Kindle edition!,"As a Jewish history professor, I assign this book every semester I teach the modern era. It is undoubtedly the best collection of documents available.I was thrilled when I noticed that an electronic edition had finally been published, and I immediately purchased it.Unfortunately, the Kindle version is the second edition of the book, originally published in 1995, not the third edition, which was published in 2010. Amazon does not mention this anywhere on the product page. The editors made substantial revisions and editions for the third edition. Why would Amazon publish an outdated edition?So do not buy the Kindle edition because you will not be getting what you think you're getting. I believe this technically constitutes false advertising. And if Amazon expects their customers to go digital than they need to rethink their approach.And if you assign this book in class warn your students not to buy the Kindle edition."
2,Very disappointing,"Although this is a very cute toy as far as appearance, the durability is very poor. After being dropped (on carpet) a few times, the voice became warbly. After a few weeks it stopped working altogether. Not worth the money."
1,Very disappointed!,Kuhn Rikon Safety Lid Lifter Can OpenerI am very disappointed about the quality of the can opener I received. I have had the exact same opener for about ten years and loved it but it became worn and no longer opened the lids smoothly. I wanted to replace it with the same model because it worked so well and bought a new one here at Amazon. The can opener I received is in worse shape than my old one. It seems very flimsy and cheap by comparison. I wanted to return it but the seller never responded to my email.
5,The Best handheld Can opener Ever,I've used mine for 2 years and it is fantastic. I prefer this can opener over any electric. It takes about 4-5 turns of the opener to get just about any can open. It's easy to open and it does a wonderful job. The lid just pops off and is perfectly safe. The edges are not sharp and there are no slivers(as described by a previous reviewer). You will not be disappointed by this product. I even recommend this item for the elderly with arthritis. It's just that easy!
5,exactly what I expected,"This is very easy to use and much better than any other standard opener than I have ever used. And since I have been opening cans for over 40 years, that's quite a few different openers. If your serious about a new opener and skeptical as to whether you'll like this new type of opener, take my word, it is very nice and I would suggest you spend the extra $$ for the deluxe all stainless. Since some of the reviewers on amazon can't be happy with anything or find negatives in anything, we would have bought the other but the other reviews made it seem like a risk. No risk here."
4,Great can opener,"I know can openers aren't typically something to get excited over, but this one is excellent. It opens the can without cutting it, so there are no sharp edges and you can re-seal the can using the original lid."
4,best open for recycling,"always had a fear of can lids, but this opener changes all that w/smooth edges on all. everyone should have this opener. only problem is sometimes getting it started."
1,Good until it failed,"Bought and used the can opener for 5 years - it was tricky to use but did a nice job - until it suddenly broke and stopped working. I'd been using the opener only a couple times a month and thought the design and reputation for quality would last for years and years, but it didn't."
2,shards of metal,I just returned this item because it left shards of metal in to the food. It cuts from the side instead of the top. It is easy to turn the knob though.
2,hard to use,"I read a lot of reviews before I purchased this. I was really excited about it. The first time I tried it, it worked great. But that was the only time. I've never again been able to make it work. It shouldn't be so hard to do. Most everyone else says it's slick, but I just can't make it work again. I'm really disappointed."
5,Best Can Opener You Will Find!,"I have had, and used a great deal, this can opener for somewhere between four and five years. Not only is it just like new still, but I still love it. It is easy to use (after a small learning curve, as another reviewer mentioned), easy to keep clean, and always looks nice.I am neurotic about can openers, and especially dirty or unsightly can openers, and I could not be more pleased with this one.It opens cans safely with no sharp edges which I, as a total klutz, enjoy immensely! It is well worth the money and if you take care of it, I believe it will last a very very long time. It is made of heavy, obviously good quality, plastic and stainless steel so it continues to perform just as well as it did when I first purchased it. I even purchased another one as a back up in case, as often happens to me, something happens to mine and I am unable to find them anymore. Two thumbs up!!"
4,Finally got one!,It took me a while to figure it out but once I did I fell in love with this tiny yet worthwhile gadget. It's been wonderful knowing my kids won't cut themselves on the jagged edge of a lid when throwing out the garbage. Great idea! Great product!
3,Famous Explorers Jacques Cartier,"I wanted a simple book that was interesting too -- for my students to get the basics of this man. About half of it was interesting, but much was simply uninteresting summarization."
3,"Nice, but Disappointing","This CD has contemporary and unexpected music, but some of the songs sound a bit like repeats. It's pleasant and somewhat refreshing, but it's not outstanding. It's nice music, but not all that special.The music is pretty, and Terzis is talented, but it didn't ""sparkle"" for me. I do recommend this CD, and I certainly won't get rid of my copy, but if you can find a used copy, save yourself a few dollars."
4,Great music,This upbeat cd is a firm favorite at our Greek restaurant! Staff sing along sometimes even though they don't know the words lol! Thoroughly recommend it .
3,Magic of The Greek Bouzouki: Near the Sea.,"I thought that they would have been some singing, in the Cd but it's only Music."
4,Complete Works of O'Henry,O'Henry wrote terrific short stories and he was noted for his twist(unexpected)endings.Fun read and you can read a whole story in short while since they are all short stories.Two stories I loved: The Cabellero's Way(the famous movies and TV series the Cisco Kid was based on this only you will see that they took huge liberties with the character in the screen versions. The short story is far better. And The Ransom of Red Chief; about a horrendous child that is kidnapped. Only he is so aggravating that the story has unexpected results(very funny).
5,A Gift from My Magi,"I received my first Christmas gift yesterday! My uncle sent me this complete collection of William Sydney Porter's, I mean, O'Henry's short stories. It's just beautiful. If you are reading these reviews, then you are familiar with these turn-of-the-last-century, surprise ending, plot-driven tales. They're all here, all the great ones: ""The Gift of the Magi"", ""A Retrieved Reformation"", ""The Last Leaf"" and ""The Ransom of Red Chief"" being among my personal favorites. If you are not familiar with O'Henry, kick back and enjoy!The real story is the book itself: formidable and classy. It is nicely and securely bound, with print slightly larger than most and paper a little bit weightier. It makes a great looking present and an even better gift of enjoyment. And this will be no coffee table book in my house. I am going to read it again and again."
2,shoddy printing,The pages look as if they are photocopied. The print is smeared and nearly illegible in places.
1,Total waste for anyone under 13,I managed to beat the game on all three dificulty levels in the span of a couple of hours. I felt like it was the biggest waste of my money on a sim that I have made in years. Many of the functions such as shovelers are a total waste of time as the fire will either be put out or spread before they are of use on the one mission they can be used on. Moving the firefighters inside of a building is a nightmare and it is almost impossible at times to finish a mission as you can not get to the person to rescue. Hose teams can only be used out doors and there are hardly any fires outdoors. Indoors you have fire extinguishers. Not realistic might be engaging to an 11 year old or less other wise save up for something better.
3,Trouble getting started,"I found this game very neat, but after a long run of trial and error. It took me hours to install, too many link, etc. In all, a good game."
1,DONT BUY THIS GAME,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ! ! ! IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY FOR ME AND IT HAS POOR GRAPHICS AND IT IS VERY HARD TO CONTROL ALONG WITH ALSO THE FIREFIGHTERS AND THE PEOPLE DIE TO FAST FOR YOU TO EVEN DO ANYTHING TO TRY AND HELP THEM .
5,Long Version/Remix is Still Dynamic...,"....I recall in the 90s' R & B radio was being hi-jacked by the New Jack Swing. Certain ol' skool artists were complainin' that they couldn't get any of their new product played on gumby-hairdoo saturated, aggressive rat-a-tat-tating new jack radio. That's why when this cut came out--from the soundtrack of Van Peebles' New Jack City--it kissed a lil of the ol' skool with the new trend and it was an instant hit that everyone seemed to dig. The extended remix has some partifying new jack bass drum electrobeats at the end of it which make you wanna move even if the babies are watching, trying to figure out what's going on with Mommie and Daddy. And with the powers that be allowing For the Love of Money to become Trump's the Apprentice theme song, I bet this can find even newer audiences. (There are however many New Jack Swing tunes which sound curiously dated nowadays. Divine reciprocity I would gather.)"
5,An Invaluable Group Counseling Textbook,"Group Leadership Skills: Interpersonal Process in Group Counseling and Therapy is a textbook designed to be an aide beyond learning the pertinent material for a particular course. As a new and practicing school counselor working with groups, my familiarity for the group process is a skill that I credit to the thorough nature of the text. Each chapter builds upon the last and by using real life examples; the content is as practical as it is engaging. Group Leadership Skills is a perfect blend of theory and application and I would highly recommend adding it to your collection of counseling texts for use in graduate courses and future professional pursuits."
5,Timeless Beauty,"First I bought this album on vinyl. Later, I bought the cassette tape. A few years later, I bought the CD. Now I'm buying the MP3. I guess that should tell you what you need to know.I've been a big fan of the Brothers Cazimero for many years, and I particularly love their older albums. Ho'ala is one of them. It combines several styles and moods, from upbeat and humorous--Na Menehune 'Ekolu--to the hauntingly lovely Mu'olaulani, written by Her Majesty Lili'uokalani. I love all of the pieces on this album, and the order in which they appear was crafted well.Robert and Roland are treasures in the realm of Hawaiian music and culture, and they've created a gem here."
3,Great music but poor sound quality,"There is a great selection of origional Vietnamese Southern traditional songs such as ""DA CO HOAI LANG"", this song later became a very popular ""CAI LUONG"" or ""6 CAU VONG CO"". Unfortunately, the sound quality of this CD is poor, too much ""NOISE"" mixed with the music."
5,Perfect Balance of two Styles,"Chorus is a perfect mix of Erasure's two main styles. While earlier Albums were more upbeat and later ones have been more mellow, Chorus mixes them both together on one album.After hearing four of the songs on Pop 20 hits, I bought this album expecting them to be the highlights of the disk. I was thrilled when I discovered that the entire CD was a highlight! The songs Waiting for The Day, Joan, and Home remain some of my favorite Erasure songs today. I enjoy both styles of Erasure's music and this CD blends them both wonderfully. Easily my favorite Erasure CD and highly reccomended!"
4,This is just so diferent from the others.,"I have followed every single album of Erasure since last 10 years, and everyone is the best. Even though, for the south america region, people just love the way they sing and the music background is perfectly match to their style:mixture of pop, rock, Raggae and soft-romantic. If you haven't listen their song, please do it, you will addict to them. If you do have already listened before, keep support, FANS."
4,For when you're in a darker mood,"With a few exceptions (Love to Hate You, e.g.), this album is less dancy than other e albums, but it has some nice songs on it, including two of my favorite e songs: Siren Song and Home."
5,Excellent historical thriller set in Georgian England,"This is the first book I have read by this particular author and it prompted me immediately to order several more on completion. A highly intelligent, literate and adult piece of historical fiction with a pleasingly sophisticated plot that is very difficult to put down - also featuring Edgar Allan Poe as the eponymous boy (though crucial to the plot he is not one of the major characters as his father is).Fully deserves the excellent reviews it received in the UK press, an enaging evocation of time and place and a wonderfully paced thriller."
3,If Wilkie Collins were writing in 2006. . .,"Don't read this book if you're looking for a story about Edgar Allen Poe--he's more of a device than a character in this book.The narrator has a chip on his shoulder throughout the book which is always a bit off-putting. This is understandable as he is that most unfortunate combination of circumstances which result in the ubiquitious ""impoverished gentleman"" -- bitter at spending his time working to support himself. This doesn't work unless the character changes during the course of the book.The dialogue recalls Wilkie Collins' work in an uncanny way."
4,A good second-stage triathlon book,"There are better books for beginners (I used Triathlon 101 by John Mora, which I found perfect for my first race), but when you're ready to focus on improving performance instead of simply finishing, this book can help you get to that next level. He explains the technical details, but then generally summarizes in layman's terms. He encourages technical training aids like heart rate monitoring, but also proposes lower-tech ways of estimating. At the end of the day, however, if you want to improve and have a limited time budget, you've got to be organized and be willing to structure your training for greater intensity. It's not easy and it's not going to hold your hand; it is focused on performance"
2,This book is too technical.,"After reading reviews that stated this book was simple to use and had specific examples, I couldn't wait to receive it. I really need time saving training methods and hoped this book would offer solutions. What I found was the usual confusing information on VO2 max, heart rate and other measurements that needed to be taken before you could move on to what you could do to train efficiently in less time. I tried to skip all that and move ahead to the meat of the book and found that pretty confusing too. If I had enough time to read and comprehend this book, I wouldn't need it...I would spend the time training. I am going to give Mark Allen's new book about the same topic a try."
2,Not a great read.,"This book was very disapointing. It is a great book if you understand all the musical terms. Cords, etc. However, the story I wanted to read was about Miles.For example, the author writes about Miles and states that ""by now Miles was having trouble with his legs."" Then goes on to discuss his band. WHAT happened? The book was so hard to get through I put it down."
2,Disappointed,"This book might be more relevant for an American school teacher, but I am teaching AIDS education in Africa and it didn't have any useful information. Plus, the book was published about 13 yrs ago, so I would recommend something a little more up to date. I guess thats my own fault though for not looking a little closer before purchasing. Luckily I didn't pay much for it. I would VERY HIGHLY recommend ""The Invisible Cure"" by Helen Epstein for anyone wanting to know more about AIDS in Africa, especially if you are going over there for AIDS or STD related work."
5,The best--very practical and thorough!,"As an educator of young men and women, I found this book to demystify much of the unknown about this difficult topic. Helpful. Thorough. Complete. A great book. Just what I needed!"
4,Great addition to the kitchen,I am always in need of a new kitchen gadget and this one is great for gravy mixes. Does not work so well with tall pots and pans.
4,An amazing young man,Matt Savage has the potential to be come the next Oscar Peterson. He's young and needs a bit of polish but over all he's an amazing and wonderful addition to Jazzdom.
4,I know you not gonna sing that song!,This CD features four versions of one of the best R&B; songs from the early '90s. None of the versions are radically different from each other. Some of you may remember this song from the movieNew Jack City.
3,catchy back in the day,I sue to dig this cut from Color Me Badd.this cut was nice&it's always cool to hear it every now&then on the Radio.it takes me back to that time&alot of fun times.
3,"One hit, the rest is background music","I adore Franoise Hardy's earlier work and had high expectations after hearing the title track on the ""Chanson"" program broadcast daily on Radio Canada's Espace Musique channel. The title track is wonderful. The rest of the CD is so ""ghostly"" and ""ephemeral"" that it fades into the background. That isn't necessarily a bad thing if that is what you are looking for, but I had higher hopes."
2,fantastic .... for a while,"I bought this set two years ago thinking I was upgrading to a high quality product that would not need to be replaced for many years, and while you do have to remember to lower the temperature on your recipes because you're baking with metalware, the results are very good and nothing sticks; however, despite proper care and only moderate use, every single piece is now peeling. I've never put these pieces into a dishwasher. I've only used nonstick utensils. But now I'm forced to decide whether to replace these expensive items or have my family eating little bits of who-knows-what.After having been very excited to upgrade my bakeware, I am extremely disappointed with the short lifespan of these pans.This is good bakeware if you don't mind replacing it regularly."
4,A Gem,"As a Seraphim LP, this disc ignited my love of opera and Mozart vocal music. I've been waiting for years for it to show up on CD. The sound is serviceable and the orchestra and conductor mediocre; but this remains Moffo at her most expressive, with a lush midrange. The recording of Deh vieni is as I rememeber it: the most affecting I have ever heard."
2,Merely Serviceable,Beautiful voice but minimalistic power in her singing with her usual crooning and skimming of the music's content.
3,minn kota powerdrive V2 55,"I have recently mounted this motor and would like to make some comments. If you plan to use a motor mounted transducer for your bow fish finder--Forget it!! The shaft of this unit slides up in an enclosed sleeve that makes it impossible to secure the transducer wire, therefore it is always hanging loose and tangleing. If you want to use a bow fishfinder bite the bullet and go for the internal mounted transducer model. Also if you are going to cover your boat better get the quick disconnect mount as this motor sticks way out in front of the bow and covers won't fit. The electric turning motor is pretty slow. There is no lighted directional marking on the top of the unit for night fishing. These are the reasons I rated it at a three."
5,Pleased Customer,"I used this trolling motor to move an 18' pontoon boat. It does an excellent job for me. I've used it in high winds, and it performs well. I highly recommend it."
4,Minn-Kota used on pontoon,"I purchased this trolling motor for use on my 24 foot pontoon and was surprised and pleased at how well it moves the boat through the water (2.2 mph according to my GPS - no wind). I have used it several times now and have yet to draw the battery below 50% charge so I don't know how many hours I can run on a charge. It goes all day with no problem.The foot controls are a great idea but the direction (left/right) controls are too 'touchy'. They seem to over-react to the slightest pressure, I wish they could somehow put some kind of a buffer in the circuit. I can't say that I have really mastered it yet. The idea of controlling from the captain's chair is great (middle of the boat).Getting the motor latched into holder after removal from the water is harder than it should be. However, once in place it is firmly held.Overall I am very pleased with the quality and performance of this motor."
5,great motor,Does what it's supposed to do. A little wax on the shaft and it's up & down with ease. Seems to not use up battery as fast as the 12 year old relic it replaces. Never need more than 1/2 power to troll my 16' boat at walleye speed. The fish will never hear you coming...
3,Minn Kota Powerdrive V2,"Not a bad trolling motor-be sure to mount it in the CENTER of the front of the boat-we have an old bass boat that had a foot controlled trolling motor that mounted on the front of the boat, but off to the side. We mounted the new one in the same spot as the one we took off, but the boat tends to want to track sideways a little. We plan on moving it to the center as soon as my husband's health returns. Plenty of power, even when it's windy. We would purchase this motor again."
2,Minn kota review,"This is a good running trolling motor, pushes a 15 1/2 foot fishing boat with three guys loaded with gear at a good rate . The only issue is pulling it from the water , there is no rip cord and it is an absolute pain to hoist it back inside the boat . Deploying it is even worse ! If you have a bad back or shoulders I wouldnt reccomend this product"
2,Terrible product unless you have newer PS2,"This remote is nearly useless if you have an older PS2. None of the regular DVD player buttons (stop, pause, play, etc.) work, you can only use the buttons that are the same as the PS2 controller (square, circle, triangle, x, etc.). The official Sony remote comes with software to update the older PS2s, but this Pelican remote does not.The item description also says that the power and eject buttons will work, but, just like with the official Sony remote, they only work with newer PS2s with the built-in IR sensor."
2,finger puppet review,Not a bad toy. Useful for babies on plane trips but that is about it. It would be better to have more than 4 in a set. 8 would be better.
1,Expensive and not helpful,I too found this book of very little help to me in learning the Yoruba language. The first 70 pages focus solely on tones and if you do not buy the cassettes then they are very difficult to study. The vocabulary is strange and random- words like intestinal worms and walking stick are taught. I found the book 1-boring and 2-hard to follow. I found the grammar explanations very random and unorganized. This book was not helpful for me and now I am looking to buy another...
5,Excellent sermon collection,"An outstanding collection of expository sermons from the book of Galatians. Michael Milton is pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Chattanooga, TN, and is a strong biblical expositor.Michael Duduit(...)"
5,Old-time Favorite,"I used to love these guys. I'm from the same town these guys are from, and know the singer's brother, but man these guys used to be my favorite. I've been to shows with them playing at least 15 times, and the crowd always responded well to them. They had great breakdowns and great riffs."
5,This Cd is incredible,"Its a shame these guys broke up. This CD is so intense, everytime i hear it i wanna rip someones head off. It also gets melodic at times too..i went to there last show in June..incredible...BUY THIS NOW!!! Classic Hardcore from one of LI's best...EVER!!"
1,Overthrow-react,"Well seeing as i alredy heard of an Overthrow from Canada years ago, i kept an open mind to this overthrow. Unfortunately to no avail....i swear i've heard this cd before....by any other NY style hardcore band. So all in all i wasn't impressed with this release. Look for canada's Overthrow to put out a much more impressive full cd soon"
1,I never received my item.,I never received this item that I ordered/purchased on 8/27/10. I purchased it with an Amazon gift card that was purchased on line for my birthday.
1,Terribly boring event,"Survivor Series 1994 is best remembered for Bob Backlund beating Bret Hart for the World Title in a 1-hour snoozefest featuring a handful of restholds and nothing else. Elsewhere, Diesel's phony push continues as he beats 10 guys by himself, Jerry Lawler battles clowns, midgets, and midget clowns, Lex Luger jobs again(yup), and Undertaker and Chuck Norris take on the world. Once again Bret hart's World title fight is moved down the card so the fans won't walk out before the end. Truly an awful show all around, except for seeing Hart's undeserved title run come to an end."
2,SURVIVOR SERIES 1994 Review,"Not one of the WWF's better pay-per-views but at the time, it was entertaining. Bob Backlund won the WWF Title from Bret, Undertaker battled Yokozuna in a casket match with Chuck Norris as ""special guest enforcer"", and Diesel finally had enough of Shawn Michaels as the two split. There was also the forgettable midget match featuring Doink & Jerry Lawler as team captains. If you saw it when it originally came out, you may want to check it out for nostalgia purposes but anyone else may just wanna avoid."
4,Quick review for the Boards,"I liked it. It's very concise and well written in an easy format to read. I think it's a good quick and easy review for optics before the exam, but I don't think it's enough alone, works best if combined with Dr.Guyton's Ophthalmic Optics books, they compliment each other.Good luck with your exams :-)"
2,Aimed at the exam taker,"As a reference book, this little handbook falls short.As alearning tool it is also lacking, with little detail or helpfuldiagrams.However, as a study tool, this review should serve the student well if he/she had a real reference from which to learn. That is, in fact, what it markets itself to be -- a last minute study review -- so no false advertising here.Kirk Carver, Patient Advocate,..."
3,Slow,"I agree with several of the other reviewers who gave this film a low rating. No doubt this story could be told in a better way. My feeling was that the film dragged and was slow moving. Too much ""romance"" and not enough action. My other concern was that some of the CGI aircraft maneuvers were not physically possible, taking away from the realism."
4,At least the baron looked happy,"Its a game to be best? You could tell he wasn't suffering from being in the trenches, and when he 'd go there, to lift moral, you could see the horror in his face.The movie needed a love story to keep you from being engulfed in the doom. The part where he tells the Kaiser to surrender was classic.Fly boys or Red baron, they need to keep making more."
2,Almost entirely Fictional,"This movie was painfully bad. The story line was fictional, cheesy, and implausible. There are almost no redeeming qualities to this movie. Please spare your eyes. You can see the dogfights on youtube.A"
3,The Red Baron,"As an historical movie... the airplanes are pretty. (Codicil: I'm an amateur WWI aviation historian and, as history, this movie made me cringe.) If you just want to see some cool flying scenes, OK, buy it, but beware. If all you're looking for is action, Flyboys is a much better use of your money."
2,"""I WAS UNABLE TO GET THE STAINS OUT""","It's all here: the original Flying Circus; authentically re-created dogfights; poorly re-created harmonica playing; an improbably Pretty Nurse trying to get blood out of a Scarf (the film's only shot at symbolism?); and attractive, bleary-eyed people suffering from the massive Gilded Age hangover known as WWI -- all while doing lots of very unattractive things with largesse that can only derive from a blithe disregard of history. Add crushingly poor directing, editing and writing (authored auf Deutsch and then translated nach Anglaise?) and you have, what exactly? Unintentional comedy!At one point -- I am not making this up -- an officer in the German High Command speaks this line without irony or, apparently, any awareness:""Verrry Interesting.""After hearing that I confess to spending the remainder of the movie waiting for Miss Pretty Nurse to ask The Red Baron to lovingly, passionately, and with Wholesome Germanic Resolve, ""Sock it to me""."
2,looks good but NOT a biopic,"I thought it visually appealing. The sets look good and so did the CGI flying. It's reasonably well acted. However, It's completely modern in its sentiment and not at all reflective of the times. Furthermore it is hopelessly inaccurate. There is too much made of the romance between Richtofen and his nurse than there is support for and multiple meetings between Richtofen and Roy Brown that are completely fanciful. If it were ""just a WWI movie"" I might shrug and say ""oh well, movies"", but it pretends to be an accurate biography and it is far, far from it. (Even ""Von Richtofen and Brown"" was closer to the truth, and it wasn't accurate either.)"
4,Really Great Movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. I love wwi and wwii movies and was especially excited to see this one. The story line I thought was great even if it was inaccurate. When has Hollywood actually cared about portraying history accurately? Aside from that the acting was superb. I loved the cast, Mathias did a wonderful job as the Red Baron. So I would recommend this movie not for teaching history, but for entertainment."
1,English language version of an original german language movie,Warner release this movie in DVD in the USA in an english version and the only option they give to customers is french subtitles. They sell the original german version in Germnany.
3,OLD SCHOOL FILMMAKING,"This is old school filmmaking at it's best.Sweeping aerial combat, impressive heroic action, striking visual effects and spectacular action carries the day.Sure, it's a fiction, but still an entertaining movie with an ironic heart."
1,Don't buy this movie,"I don't know why they called this movie 'The Red Baron' as outside of the character's name there is not one correct fact in the entire movie.Wrong dates, wrong planes and wrong instances. I doubt the writers ever read a book on Richthofen when they wrote the script.Even the CGI graphics suck in the movie. I've seen better actions sequences in the game 'Rise Of Flight' than you get in this movie.I could understand taking liberties with the occasional fact here and there, but the movie is unrecognizable as a movie based on his life.There's no character build-up at all, just random characters entering and exiting the movie, with no explanation of why they are there.It's bad enough that the movie has so many historical errors, the movie is simply bad as a work of fiction.If there was an option to give it zero stars, that's what I would have given it."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"This is a terrific movie. I hadn't heard anything about this movie prior to its release and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the acting, the script and the production. This is an indpendent film with top-tier studio qualities. The story itself appears to be at least fairly historically accurate and entertaining. This is a must own for military history buffs."
1,Horrible,"Read Nachtjager's review. This is a terrible movie and worse if you are a history buff and WWI ""enthusiast"".FLYBOYS was a MUCH better WW1 movie than this one and that's saying something. :-P"
2,the red baron,did not like iti found it very inaccuratei brought the dvd thinking it was about manfred von richtofeninstead it is more of a love storyi have since purchasedvon richtofen & brownin the hope this is the dvd i was looking forif you really want to learn about the red barontry the book RICHTOFEN by william e burrows
3,Must disagree with Troy Tempest a bit,"While this film certainly gets into a lot of the funny and old WW1 movie stereotypes (French nurse love interest), no WWI movie could be worse than Flyboys. In Flyboys, all Germany planes were painted as if they were the Red Baron (minus the one mystery ace who fly a black plane) and they all flew the experimental Fokker D.III triplane that saw only limited production because of its lame engine/top speed and horrible visibility. At least Manfred spends most of his time in an Albatross in this movie (as he actually flew) so I can't see how a 'WWI buff' could support Flyboys EVER. I can accept complaints about this movie, except for saying that ANY WAR MOVIE EVER WAS AS BAD AS FLYBOYS."
2,The Red Baron - Not so great,"There are a number of documentaries available about the Red Baron, but not many movies, if any. If you are an military aviation history buff, this may not be to your liking. Most of the historical aircraft are duplicated nicely, especially in the digital flying scenes which are fairly well done, from a viewer's perspective, but probably pretty awesome for the technical crew that put it together. The actual life and historical military activity on Manfred Von Richthofen was pretty far off, and had most of the real history been included, it would have been a far more interesting and exciting movie. If you are into a movie with some fine digital work, but very much lacks on historical accuracy, this may be for you."
2,Not entertained,"First of all the story is not historic, so I watched from an entertainment mind. However, the movie was not that entertaining. Almost fall asleep a few times.I find that some segments of the movie didn't flow/connect/or very clear. For example, Red Baron was in a factory (very upset) and wanted to see a report where the British claimed that they had used the British engine in their aircraft. Not sure why he was upset or the purpose of this segment (could probably been left it on the cutting floor). There are many segments like these.The CGI of the dog fights was pretty cool."
2,its a ok movie,its a ok movie but it goes nowhere the ending sucks not a lot of dogfights it would be better to rent it will save your money to buy a better movie i liked flyboys a lot better////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
2,Cheesy story line and obvious compter effects,"This story has NOTHING to do with actual historical facts. In fact the crummy computer effects have nothing to do with how an aircraft actually flies. If you want to see real planes being flown by real pilots, buy or rent THE BLUE MAX. This film caters to the uneducated masses who start every sentence with the word DUDE...."
1,The Red Baron [Blu Ray] US version.,"This USA release is simply a shamefully edited version of the original european film. A full 20 minutes of footage has been removed for some unknown reason. The european blu ray version has so many more enjoyable / extended scenes than this. Why was this done? Removing so much footage makes this title seem to ""rush along"" and the missing footage is dearly missed. The people who edited this version should immediately kill themselves."
5,A great sequel to the original collection,"Although I recommend purchasing the original Time-Life Treasury of Christmas collection first, this collection is a fitting and worthwhile companion set. If you already own the first set, you'll DEFINATELY want to add this set to complete your collection!"
5,High End Candle,"This candle is so much better than so many others I have purchased over time. The scent is not ""too"" much, yet gives enough of a scentwhereas you're able to enjoy it."
4,Great product!,"Root candles are excellent compared to other candles. The quality of these candles surpass the competition. We purchased several fragrances and love them all! If you want a no mess, no soot, long-lasting candle, then Root is for you. The only reason we didn't rate it a 5 star is that sometimes the wick has a ""build-up"" that needs snipped after a few usages. Definitely recommend this candle."
2,Basically A Jar of Wax--Stick With Yankee Candles,"I veered away from my usual Yankee Candle Co. purchase because I had read some good reviews about this candle. I don't know if I received a defective candle, but when I lit it and waited for the aroma to surround the room, I was sorely disappointed! There is almost no scent to this candle. On the plus side, it does burn well, which is why I gave the product two stars instead of one, but what's the point? When I buy a scented candle, I expect the scent to fill the room after it is lit. I will definitely stick with Yankee Candles. I've tried many different scented candles (even some of the Avon-types sold by catalog and representative for WAY too much money, I think they're called Party Lite), and Yankee Candle Co. has the BEST products by far. From now on, I will stick with what I KNOW is a great product!"
1,it smells bad,I received this toy and it smells so bad that I am afraid it will kill my bird if I give it to him. I have let it sit out of the box for 2 days hoping the smell will go away but it hasn't yet. Will probably be returning the item.
2,Zinc free...Lead free.....?,But what about what IS actually used to dye the rope and what IS used to tan the leather? I had the same reaction as a previous reviewer about the smell. What is the smelly leather tanned with? Checked the Penn Plax website and the web and couldn't find any info other than about zinc and lead. If I knew what was used on the parts maybe I would feel better about giving it to my bird but I haven't had the nerve to yet.
4,Scott Fitzgerald Meets Edward Abbey,"In Mr Davis' ""Leaving Defiance Bay,"" we are presented with a literary elegy for the environment, the poignant and funny story of a Pacific Northwest man's bafflement at America's love affair with development and his own romantic quandries. The main character's alcoholism works as a powerful metaphor for the unsteadiness of national principles and of modern society, and in an era where one has difficulties dealing with the Orwellian nature of truth from the White House on down, Davis' meditation seems more necessary than ever. Go on and try it; it can only enrich you."
5,fast and clean,this product is really good at removing nail polish cuz it's fast and clean. the only thing is it's so smelly.
2,not for the high level thinkger,The book is designed for quick and simple inspiration...not for the high level thinkers out there.....
4,One of my favorites,"I've many CD's of Chet Baker. This will be one of my favorites. Although I saw a negative review of this collection, I find the sounds bright and fun. I'm a sucker for strings, and lush arrangements.BTW: This CD is a combination of Chet's ""In Milan"" and ""With Fifty Italian Strings."" So, if you're a serious collector of Baker's recordings, you may already have it."
5,F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S,"I was at a club in South Beach, Miami, and saw Vanessa live. She knows how to get a crowd going. This track is definately ""The Bomb"""
3,needs to be more objective,"I thought the books was very good as I love reading books by Ann Rule. However, this book was not very objective and painted Jerry Harris as such a wonderful man and Susan as such an intelligent and sweet person. This books seemed to be largely an in depth interview about Susan Harris and her wonderful life with Jerry Harris. It made these characters a little bit too perfect which took away the objectivity and made me feel the books was not real enough. It seemed the author did not delve more into the characters when researching this book."
2,not the best book by Ann Rule,"not her best and I wonder if she should not have written it at all since she obviously didn't have enough material for a real book. She just keeps harping on the good guys being so good and the bad guys being so bad without much detail to back it up. Sad. I thought I-5 Killer, Dead by Sunset, and Everything she ever Wanted were fabulous."
3,Not one of her best,"I am a serious lover of Ann Rule books, but this wasn't one of my favorites. It really took a while to grab my attention, unlike other books I've read by her. Not her best, but still a good read when compared to most other true crime books."
3,Murder & Mayhem,Ann Rule stories are interesting in that they are true but her writing leaves a lot to be desired. Takes to long to tell the story.
1,In the Name of Love,"I read this book when it first came out and my first thought was ""Ann Rule did not write this book"". It is poorly written and not at all in the same wording / manner that Ann Rule uses.Second, it is totally one sided. I am sorry but the 'poor victim' was a crook himself that took from others and used others to get what he wanted.He was murdered because he stepped on people to get money for his own benefit.I wonder, did Ann Rule get paid by Jerry's wife to write such a false account of this devious man?Not worth reading if you have read any other Ann Rules, and if you want to read TRUE life crime novels."
2,This book does not give enough background on main characters,"I read this book in much the same way as I have read Ann Rule's other books: fast. While I enjoy her books, Ann Rule does not define the main characters here as much as she has in say, ""Everything She Ever Wanted."" For instances, why did Jerry Harris get his nose broken three times if he was such a saint? Why didn't Ms. Rule do more research into the character of Steve? I would have preferred to look at this story from the angle of how someone is set up to be a good guy, a scapegoat, and how they play it out over their lives. I was irritated overall by Ann Rules one-dimensional view of everyone. And I did not like being made a part of Susan and Jerry's schemes to outwit others as part of a cute joke."
5,A Brilliant Contribution,"I must say that this is one of the most interesting books I've read so far concerning the experience of everyday (Soviet?) socialism. By reconsidering such an important subject through a solid (and novel) theoretical lens and providing high quality ethnographic data, Yurchak does what every good ethnographer should do: (laconically speaking) bring something new. This is a must-read for anyone who is interested in (post)socialism. Last but not least, it is very fun to read."
5,running aid,"This ointment, used by my husband-a long time runner-is his favorite. When he was unable to find in a retail store, we found it on the Internet and ordered it there. Using it always when he runs."
3,AVERAGE,My 2 1/2 year old son received this as a Christmas present and played with it for about a day. Now it just sits in his room and collects dust. It just isn't a toy that you can sit and play with for hours at a time. He honestly hasn't even looked its way since the day he opened it. I wouldn't waste my money!
2,"Tumble N Laugh Koda, not worth the money","My son quickly got bored with this toy. It's cute, but it is hard and you cannot cuddle it. Recommended only for collectors of Brother Bear stuff."
1,Horrible Audio Quality,"Got this Bluetooth receiver kit from Best Buy, tried it in my home stero system before even hooking it to my car, but was extremely disappointed by the audio quality.I stremed mp3 songs from my Motorola RAZR phone, but the audio quality through this bluetooth kit was so horrible I did not believe how the company even puts such a kit in the market claiming that it is a ""stereo bluetooth audio kit""..Complete joke..Motorola Bluetooth Car Kits are WAY better and superior to this, I tested one and the audio quality is as good as wired stereo.Buy Motorola, and not this piece of junk."
5,The best treatise on sales I have read.,This is truly the definitive book on sales technique. The author has a phenominal understanding of sales. I have attended his seminar and find his techniques to be right on target. I have never read a more complete and understandable book on sales.
2,Old School/Yesterdays News,"I stumbled across this guy when I was a new salesperson. Needless to say, it probably could have been good training for a pushy furniture salesperson in the 70's, but this material is hopelessly out of synch with the corporate marketplace of today.I recommend ""The Sandler Selling system"" which works wonders, in terms of information that is usable in a corporate environment. Next, Tony Robbins offers a decent sales training too. Both are far superior to this..."
2,Mistaken Reviews,I see the favorable reviews for this book and must assume they have it confused with the excellent Ron Willingham book with the same title. Mr. Ley has constructed book you can only hope your competition is using for a text. The book can be counter productive if used by someone with less than a month's experience in sales. Most with that much experience will recognize how shallow it is.
4,great scent; great hold,"I have used Aussie products off and on for years, and I never get tired of that certain scent they use.You don't need a lot of this product to get good styling results. Hold lasts all day, too. Smells great. What else can I say..."
3,Very touching and heart warming story,"This book was slow to begin with, but as you got into it it was a very warm and caring book about two people who really loved each other. To bad there was so much tragedy to Danina. She was a very warm a loving person. I feel that Nikolai should have gone with her to Vermont instead of Siberia with the Czar and Czarina. It seems his priorities were a little confused. I think she is writing too many books a year and she is running out of ideas on what to write. Alot of her books are beginning to sound a like in a lot of ways."
2,Should have gone to the library for this one,"I have been a fan of DS for a long time yet she is quickly losing me on her new work. 'Granny Dan' in my eyes was ZOYA meets The Ghost. Another ballarina...another box full of memories and lost treasures from a different life..haven't we heard this before? Granted, it was a nice quick sunday afternoon read...but nothing more."
2,What a disappointment!,"This book is your basic summer ""no thinking required"" read. I (like several other reviewers) was totally shocked at the amateurish editing... assuming this book was edited at all. It was a waste of money, and I'm ticked off that I bought it. :-( The story's setting had a lot of potential, but DS never went anywhere with it... she just re-played the same old romance cliches over and over. This was my first (and probably last) DS book."
5,Danielle Steel Does it Again!,Once again Danielle Steel brings her own special artistry in writing this novel and in doing so brought forth memories of special times shared with my own late grandmother. A heart-rendering story of love lost but never forgotten.
