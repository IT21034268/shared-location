3,jay,i liked the mats for my wifes truck she likes tweety and sylvestor glad that you had them very hard to find .
2,Not very sturdy,"The canopy bar broke only two days after Christmas.Now I have a sharp end on the bed frame. Not goodfor little fingers. For the price, I thought it wouldhave been a lot more sturdy."
4,One thing wrong,"I love all the accessories you get with this crib. I think the pattern is adorable. The only draw back I have with this is the canopy is only in there by 2 little prongs and if you go to pick the crib up by it, it pops off there is nothing there to hold it on. I suggest getting a super glue or gorilla glue and use that so it will never come off. Also you have to slide the canopy in through the sewn hole and then put it on. Other then that I love the product I would recommend it to everyone. It roles with ease and I know the first thing my daughter did was climb inside it and she is 25 pounds and it held her. She loves it. I love it."
5,Marriages and Families,"Before I got this book I had a lot of questions about relationships with family, etc. This book breaks down so many things having to due with marriages, famileies, friends, just relationships in general. I have applied a lot of what I have read in this book to my every day life and you wouldn't believe the amount of changes I have made since then. Reading this book has given me a better understang of a lot of different things."
3,"Marriages and Families: Changes, Choices and Constraints (6th Edition) (MyFamilyLab Series)","I was satisfied with the book. The cover was a bit torn, highlighted, but i was pleased. Was shipped out on time and received in less than 2 weeks."
5,Good Book,This is quite an interesting book. Finding it on Amazon added to how useful it was- the price really saved me. Used it to study for my first exam and got an A. Couldn't have done it without the book!
1,Awful,They sent me this package on 10/24/12 which has an expiry date of 11/2012. I would not have bought if it was from a store.
5,Clever idea ... fantastic art!,"I really like this book. The art is fantastic, the idea remarkable. In reading it, please keep in mind that it's a fantasy for kids ... not adults (except adults like me who have never grown up).I think the author had some very creative lines in this book and some scenes that I applaud. But I think it would have a wider audience as a Christian book since it's a God-themed base ... which agrees with my philosophy and beliefs. But it isn't Biblically based, which would turn some Christians off, but I think it's perfect for children in the author's targetted age range.Clever! Clever.Lighten up, people!"
5,Great non-tradional wearable timepiece,"This is a great watch with a readable face and hands. I'm not a fisherman, but I use 2-3 keyboards on my desk, and a wristwatch would scratch them up as I jump from one to the other. I've been using these Dakota carabiner watches for years, and just hang it from a beltloop on my slacks/jeans. I'm an engineer, and I use the other functions a lot- red LED mini-light, stopwatch, alarm, etc., as well."
2,Poor design,I haven't even used this steamer because the tiers and lid don't seem to fit properly. I will be returning it.
2,garbage,worst steamer among the 10+ sub $50-ish steamers i have worn out from daily use since 1998. clueless design and features.
1,steamer,"This streamer lasted only a few months. First, the timer numbers started to disappear and them the thing stopped working altogether. I followed all instructions but this is not intended to be used often and I like steaming my vegetables and potatoes. I replaced this with a pot with a steamer insert. I will never go back to buying an electric steamer since this one was my second electric one."
4,a proud daughter,"Though I must confess, I have not fully finished the book, what I HAVE READ IS TRULY MY FATHER. I am proud that my father finally followed through with a promise. He wrote a book for us. the book is a great legacey of my family's history and a fascinating journey into his physci. I hope to follow in his footsteps one day and write of his daughters and our life with and without him... I miss you daddy I miss the way you made me laugh, I miss your gruff, yet comforting voice... I can have the laughter and the voice in your book; that is where it will always live."
3,A voyage into a burden man's soul.,"This book , from a scholar's stand point is abstract and odd. From a person close to the author, the book hits a nerve. The characters in the book strongly eariely resemble real people in the author's life. The book appears to be a metorphoric plea for forgivness, a plea to those he hurt along his way. Could it be that this man has a deep ladien subconcious guilt? The tormenter is none other then the author him self. The boy, his eldest daughter. The young wife,is none other than her mother, his first wife. Reader, he seeks this forgivness in vain. He would not recieve it in life, and now in death, he is yet to earn it!"
1,Sub Zero,"A friend lent me this book, as it had some intellectual underpinnings. I must say that it is one of the worst books I have read in ages. The author is apparently French and was raised by hippies. One can sympathize with him for having such a dreadful upbringing. However the book is full of revolting sexual images. Reading the critical response the theme of the book is apparently with the collapse of the old morality society has become fragmented and pointless. This apparently gives the author some leeway to write about a character who spends most of his time jerking off after seeing young girls. The book is full of big statements such as ""there is no such thing as homosexuality. All homosexuals are pedophiles who would drop their current partner for an 18 year old"". Generally the book is dull, semi pornographic and filled with bald pretentious observations about the world."
5,A Move Back to Classic Buffett,"Take the Weather With You has more of a classic Buffett feel than any of his albums over the past 10 years or so even though he only wrote two of the songs. Party At The End of the World evokes the party sound of his concerts. The steel drums of Cinco de Mayo in Memphis takes us back to the good old days and the cover of Henry Kapono's Duke's on Sunday takes you to Waikiki Beach. After the blatantly commercial License to Chill and the more esoteric Far Side of the World and Beach House on the Moon, this is a welcome addition for all long-time Buffett fans!"
5,All New Buffett,"I consider this one of his best in ages. Usually there are a few new songs and the rest are oldies. If I want to hear ""Margarettaville"",I can play in on one of the ""traditional"" Buffett CDs. This is a totally new, great sounding, and relaxing CD. Recommend it highly. Also want to wish him a happy one as the Pirate is passing 60 a week behind me."
2,didn't like,love Jimmy Buffet but not a fan of this CD. Just a little too country for me. My husband does like country but never listens to this cd- guess it wasn't his cup of tea either
2,"""I don't know...""","I have only listened to the CD a couple of times yet I couldn't keep from trying to decide what the heck he was trying to do on this release. He didn't write much of it so is he trying to use his following to introduce new people? Another question, why in the middle of this did he choose to do such a crappy cover of the Mark Knophler song? I just thought the whole thing was pretty uninspired. Maybe his self professed lack of direction isn't just an act, but somehow I can't believe that the guy that wrote such introspective, insightful and truthful lyrics in his 20's, 30's and 40's can't come up with somethin' better."
2,Why Bother?,"Jimmy gets a writing credit on 4 of the 14 songs on here. My question is, if he really doesn't have anything to say, why would I want to listen? It is a shame JB is diluting his strong catalog with his last several bland offerings."
3,What an opening track.,"Much of modern Buffett sounds repetitive to me, but ""Bama Breeze"" is a knockout. Practically had me running to the airport to hit the Gulf Coast and drink away the days. It's the real thing."
3,A couple great songs...,I was somewhat disappointed in this album. I love Buffet too. Only a couple good songs on the cd in my opinion.
4,I can't get the songs out of my head!!,"Great CD!! Some of the songs are so-so, but the majority of them are truly addictive. Just like many of Jimmy's earlier songs, you will find these songs playing in your head when you're not listening to them.Thank goodness, now Radio Margaritaville has some new material to play!"
5,Feel Good CD,"Really good music! A little different than last released CD, country feel but still has his signature sound. Love the title song!! ""Bama Breeze"" is about the bar everyone knows & where they have the most fun. ""Breathe In Breathe Out"" puts a horrible event into everyday prespective and makes you feel you can get thru anything. ""Duke's on Sunday"" brings back wonderful memories of family vacation. Listen to this CD while on the freeway in LA, makes the ride so much nicer!!"
4,This is the one we've waited for,"Jimmy Buffett's music had gotten stale in the late 80's and stayed there for almost two decades. Sure, there were flashes of greatness, mostly when covering other's songs. This album is different, and is a progression. He finally has accepted his age and is singing within his range. He's singing more of other writer's songs too, and it pays off. Jimmy Buffett has always occupied his own genre within the music world and when his music is good, there's no one better. He's right on target here. Many of his recent albums have been unintentional self-parodies (self parroties???). This is the real thing!Thanks for sticking around, Jimmy Buffett, we missed you."
3,New Music. Not a Repeat. Has his writing talent faded?,Some good songs but not the quality of his earlier works. Has he lost his shaker of salt for writing songs? Did 5 O'clock somewhere make him think we want him to be more country? I like country music but that's not what I want from Jimmy. I want the unique poetry of the past.
4,Good JB,"I loved the songs Bama Breeze and End of the World. The video was good too. After years of listening to Buffett I find I have a sort of love/hate relationship with his later CD's. Some good, some not so good. This one is GOOD!"
4,Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy,"I am not a fair reviewer because I love everything about Jimmy. However, I will say, that the title was misleading to me. All of the music is good, I just did not fall in love with it the first listen through, it took me two plays. That is not normal for me and Jimmy. Anyway, this is good cd, worth buying, even for a non-collector."
3,It's okay...,"Meet Me In Margaritaville was one of those CD's that I liked...no, I mean I loved...every single song on the CD. This is not one of those. I liked several of them but this isn't Jimmy Buffett's best work."
5,Best in years,"This is Jimmy Buffett's best album in years. It's a nice mix of styles with enough of his basic Caribbean style, returning after his brief detour to Nashville. Only three of the songs are written by Buffett, perhaps indicating that he needed a little outside inspiration. I suppose you can't keep writing great songs forever."
2,Pass the Tequila....and my Blackberry...and the Wall Street Journal,"Another ""product"" from the Parrothead that refused to grow up. I supported myself in the 70's playing Jimmy's songs, and basically I've been over it since ""Margaritaville"" reared its silly salt-rimmed head in '77. Since then, he's gone from someone who wrote fabulous songs & character sketches to writing ""Jimmy Buffett Songs"", seemingly a genre itself. These have all the requisite geographical and cultural references necessary to be a ""Jimmy Buffett Song"". His first 4 (6 if you count his 2 earliest releases, ""Down to Earth"" & ""High Cumberland Jubilee"") albums were absolute gems, but with the issue of ""Changes in Latitudes..."", he drifted down a road I didn't want to travel. Still witty, still a very talented songwriter, but no longer my cup of grog. He is to be commended for his choice of covers; songs written by the incredible Guy Clark, and Mary Gauthier among others, but I've retired my goofy fin hat forever."
2,This CD is like the Yankees.....,"a lot of great players but not many hits. I heard this ""record"" on Radio Margaritaville with introductions by Jimmy before each song. There are some very fine musicians playing with Jimmy but there was nothing I'd want to hear over and over again in my CD player as I went down the road. I enjoyed Bama Breeze. My opinion here is probably swayed because of the video."
5,Don't Believe the Hype,"Anyone who gave this set a poor review is not a true Marley fan and does not understand anything about Bob Marley's estate and who is profiting from this box set. THE VAST MAJORITY of the profits from this set GO DIRECTLY TO THE ESTATES of BOB MARLEY, PETER TOSH, and BUNNY WAILER. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. This is one of the few earlier Marley compilations where Bob and the rest of the Wailers are being given PROPER ROYALTIES. I know for a fact that this is the case as I have had an e-mail correspondence with Mr. Roger Steffens, the world's foremost expert on Bob Marley as well as one of the gentlemen who compiled this set. THIS IS AN AMAZING SET - no other Bob Marley collection encompasses his earlier work as well as this one. I would also STRONGLY SUGGEST picking up Part II, which is just as good! One Heart."
5,Words from a TRUE Marley fan,"To hear this CD trashed by such amateur reggae listeners is an insult to those of us who can appreciate Bob's entire career---not just what appears on ""Legend."" There is so much depth and musical innovation in this set that I've just purchased Vol. 2 as a natural compliment. Sure, some of the tracks are raw and unpolished, but that's what makes it such a fabulous recording! Alternate versions of ""Bend Down Low,"" ""Rockin' Steady"" and ""Put it On"", plus a list of previously unreleased tracks such as ""Sugar Sugar,"" ""Rock to the Rock"" and ""Nice Time"" make this collection a must-have for a ""true"" Bob Marley fan. I would venture to say that these early recordings are even more influential and moving than the later recordings on Tuff Gong. All in all, this was one of the best multi-CD collections I've ever purchased. Don't deprive yourself of this exquisite collection based on these other misguided reviews."
4,Marley's Quest,"This box set focuses on Marley trying to bring the Wailers to an International scene. Disc 1 is probably the best featuring Marley from 1968, some famous tracks, but alternate, or original. Disc 2 is not so famous, but really good. And Disc 3 features 4 versions and great songs from 1970. Trust Me! Buy this box set if your the real Marley fan. And like work before the Catch a Fire or Soul Rebels album. If your just familliar with Legend and those songs these songs will sound odd. And the Box set is digitally remastered and sound good."
1,Ripoff By Reggae Hustlers,"I spent good money on this and two other Marley sets thinking they were a big special thing from the packaging, and I could've cried at the money I wasted. It's not fair to put these leftovers out as mainline recordings. They sound awful and depress you to be around. I'm sure Bob felt likewise."
1,Odd Leftovers,"There's too many Marley packages and boxes and what-have-you in stores that are glaringly there to hustle people who don't know his best work. And this is way too expensive to justify the odd peek yet get at his weakest sessions. Save your money for ""Songs of Freedom."""
1,Complete Disgrace,Put a handsome wrapper around a horrible ripoff and all you've done if try to deceive. These are substandard rehearsal cuttings all musicians accumulate and no artist would take seriously or want to share with a trusting or respectful public. This marketing scam marks a new lowpoint in disrespect of Marley's memory.
1,A Bad Trick,Don't get tricked into buying this series. It's doesn't soundadequate or professional. But it's evil to make these things that are so bad appear to be worthwhile just to make money off Marley lovers. Stop in the name of One Love!
2,The Cover was more exciting than the movie,This movie was a bore. No plot or cimatic buildup...i actually fast forwarded thtough half of it waiting for it to get good...it never did to say the least.
1,Not quite worth the price,40 bucks is pretty hefty for what you get. I expected that at least they would have used both sides of the tape. The rather thin book seems to have been put together at Kinko's.
2,Canned Creole: A Problematic System,"Maybe I've been spoiled by all of the great new language products, but this Basic Creole book and tape fall far short of my most basic expectations for a language series. The book and tape appear to have been assembled in someone's garage and the quality of the content follows suit. The sound is horrible, the design of the lessons is haphazard, and the scope of the grammar and vocabulary reviews is extremely limited. I would recommend that anyone interested in learning this language should get a firm grip on French and then find a Haitian friend and a good Creole dictionary, because this set will not prepare the student for a conversation. On the other hand, I am grateful that Moseley at least attempted to market a means of learning this beautiful language."
1,not worth it,This book is entirely unhelpful. It does nothing to explain the Creole language. It seems to aim to confuse the listener. I learned more Creole in one day of travelling than this book taught me in several run throughs. If you want to learn Creole stay away from this book.
4,A good place to start,"This is a very good introduction to learning Haitian Creole. There are very few language tapes available for Haitian Creole, and of those available, this is by far the most reasonably priced. The written transcript and dictionary are helpful to the novice. The tape is an appropriate place to start learning this beautiful language."
2,Basic Creole not recommended,Not at all worth the price because the quality of the tape provided was so poor.
5,Super intro to prairie dogs,"Having spent seven years living just outside Denver where I fell in love with prairie dogs, I was excited to discover this book. Truly, Russell Graves presents the good, bad, and adorable about these captivating little animals. The book provides plenty of facts, but is easily readable, and thankfully, not encumbered with vague scientist's jargon (though, apparently Mr. Graves has the credentials to do that). The photos are really good, and made me miss being able to watch the prairie dogs' hilarious antics up close. Good book for almost all ages, and good for the coffee table, too!"
3,Just OK,It had information in it but there are other magazines of the same type that put out much more useful information.
5,I love this magazine,I have read this magazine from cover to cover twice already and I have only had it for 1 week. It has so much information in it and it is exciting to read. I am a newbie to country life. We are looking for OUR place in the country now to buy so we are reading everything we can get our hands on. I am happy I bought this subscription.
4,"It's great, BUT....","This is a fun magazine I must admit, however, since many of the entries are by readers themselves, sometimes the information therein is lacking. There are occasions where someone will discuss something like raising goats, or growing apple trees, and not go into enough specifics. It is good though to spark your interest and read how others are doing, or what they are doing."
5,The best mag EVER!!,"This magazine is like no other. All the articles are written by subscribers. They cover any and all topics of small scale farming, simple living, homesteading, etc. There are classifieds where people can ask for help with projects or ask for people to send info on a specific topic. Each magazine is **FULL** of information. I LOVE this magazine. I recommend it for any and all who have even the slightest interest in simple living."
2,"Enjoy, but editor is Far-Left Loony","I recently renewed my subscription to Countryside after 11 years. I don't remember the editor being so far-left. Neither my husband or I can stomach his articles praising Obama (preparing for the repurcussions desined to follow this man's disasterous policies are why we are seeking to live more self-sufficiently). We overwhelmingly prefer BackHome Magazine for useful information and articles written by like-minded limited-government, self-sufficient enthusiasts."
5,Works for me,"I bought these 5 years ago through a catalog. I placed them in the attic for a week, then the 2nd floor, then the 1st and finally the basement. I did this in the winter. The spring and summer came and I had no trouble with bugs. When they started a city sewer project my neighbor hood was overrun with rats. I'm the only guy on the street that had no rats or mice.I have heard others complain about these not working but I've been happy. My old model number was sb101. I hope these work half as well. If you live in the north put them in your basements now and it will keep mice from moving in. Good luck"
4,GREAT!! Suave House Flava,This is the Best CD Crime Boss has done. There are some major bass beats on this album. The album has off the hook story telling songs that can really bring the hype. You don't get to much better than this. You can listen to this in your CD player without skipping a song. TRUE SOUTHERN SOUND!!
4,Great daily reading....,I own several books similar to this one that I read with my husband each and every day and this one is quickly becoming our favorite. It touches so many different aspects of forgiving and letting go. So glad I added this book to my collection :)
5,Nice book!,"I love that this book is very small. I can carry it in a purse, or stick it in my nightstand drawer, very easily. It is full of great ideas and is very helpful and inspirational. I RECOMMEND it."
4,Very healing stuff,A great daily devotional. Compassionate and caring guide to forgiving and letting go of past events whether self-incurred or inflicted by others.
3,fine book,"I'm not sure that I agree with all of the facts, figures and conclusions, but the author's heart is in the right place and I do agree with the general theme."
5,world poker tour RULES!,Excellent dvd set. Poker junkie here that is happy as can be!The best show on TV period!!!!!THNX
5,Excellente Service,"I was in a business travel for only 3 days and some inconvenient had to change to a different hotel.I had to cancel one order and creat a new one without any extra charge to my credit card.Customer Service was GREAT, get in contact with me asap for every inquiries I've made and treat me as if I were the only customer they handle.THANK YOU !!!"
4,Dark and full of emotions,"Dreadful Shadows are a band that have composed some great music for their genre . This album takes you on another dark journey through their unique rock-goth melodies . This may not be their best release to date , but this specific edition is a MUST for all fans , since it includes a limited edition bonus material from live sessions .For all new comers , i suggest looking up some of their older stuff as well. Dreadful Shadows are also very well known in the goth world for their EXCELLENT cover songs which include 80s classics such as ""Twist in my Sobriety"" and ""Lullaby"" .For all you die hard Dreadful Shadows fans you must own the miniCD ""Apology"" to hear some great stuff as well ."
4,Good Cd but not great or excellent,A good album by Chicane. Impressive release. A creative album that showcases various talents of Chicane. Mostly mellow and chill-out music but still interesting. I like the creativity behind the album. It might get boring after listening very often. But the trick is not to listen over and over. More ambient than trance but still good. I would say ALMOST as good but not completely good as the debut album. I like the traxx and songs. I would like to hear more music like this but towards trance/dream dance and less towards chill-out. Good after hour music for clubs or anywhere else that you would like to play.
4,Don't give up,"The 'Saltwater', 'No Ordinary Morning', and 'Don't Give Up' tracks are very good- you know the 'Don't Give Up' track if you saw Vegas Showgirls on E!. 'Don't Give Up' is a bit cutesy and has a bubblegum feel to it, but the other tracks are quite different- they have more of a trance feel to them. Overall, it's a good CD and if you buy it, you won't waste your money."
1,A new definition of boredom in trance music,"After listening to this I'm just bored to a degree of apathy and can't really think of writing much more... the best part of this album is some tunes they stole from their former album ""Chilled"". No redeeming qualities for what I can see. Maybe you'll like it if you're used to the Cafe del Mar series that I find equally boring. Trance light for those ""not-in-the-know""."
4,"Gorgeous, but Not All Like Halcyon","OK, I'm a trance junkie, and bought ""Behind the Sun"" based solely on my love for ""Halcyon"". While the complete album doesn't quite reach the pinnacle of that masterpiece, it is nonetheless a beautiful piece of artistry, well worth your listen..."
3,Too simple.. Too poppy,"Comparing with ""FFTMC"", this album is just too simple and poppy. Not even nearly as hypnotising and taking you away as ""FFTMC"". I usually love female vocals, but most vocals in this album are very weak, and just doesn't fit into music. Probably the only composition worth listening is ""Saltwater"", but isn't there just a ""Saltwater"" single? Better get the single. Well.. Overall, 3 stars rating is pretty precise. Many other musicians which work in Chicane style would get 4 stars for the same album, but Chicane gets 3 start - too weak after such a great album like ""FFTMC""."
4,One of 2000's Definitive Clubber-Comedown Albums,"Definitely one of the most [perhaps overly] played post-clubbing albums of the year 2000. I can't praise any of the ten tracks as amazing, but most are pretty good. Unfortunate that Chicane decided to team up with Bryan Adams for its only cheesy track, ""Don't Give Up"". It would have also been nice to get an extra novel track instead of including The Thrillseekers' remix of ""Saltwater"" in addition to the original.3.5/5 stars."
5,The Perfect CD,"If there's ever gonna be a 'perfect cd' it has to be this! Every single track is great, and has this very inner-feelings! I cant say anything bad about any track!Extremely melodic, and very pleasant, his music (Nick) goes well with the dancefloor, as well as for everyday listening....and ull never get bored of it!My favorites are saltwater, saltwater (the thrillseekers remix), halcyon, andromeda....well...just about everything!I heard he's creating the music for EA's F1 2001....can't wait for that!Well done Nick!"
5,"best 50-60' surf or beach party compilation, + jenny pics!","If you're on your 30's and you don't enjoy this cd, you're dead or you've never heard radio in your life.There are great songs in this cd I heard as a kid, but didn't know their names or who played them, like 'Walk dont run' and the Tarantino-movie-famous 'Misirlou'(Pulp Fiction), others by Beach Boys and Ventures.I played this cd for the 1st time at the computer center of my university (I am studying a MBA in Peru) and my mates made me play the whole album for three times in a row. Enuff said"
4,Nice Christmas Big Band CASSETTE TAPE,"Great Christmas Big Band tape. We have to be careful when listings the tracks. The CD version is not always the same as the CASSETTE version. The listings shown are of the CD VERSION. The Cassette tape (which this one is) Does NOT include ""Winter Weather"" but INSTEAD, DOES include ""Santa Claus is Coming To Town"" by Lester Lanin & His Orchestra.Total tracks include:Jingle Bells - Duke Ellington & His OrchestraSnowfall - Claude Thornhill & His OrchestraRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer - Sammy Kaye & His OrchestraDixieland Band from Santa Claus Land - Jimmy DorseyWhite Christmas - Bobby HackettGreensleeves - Les ElgartChristmas Song - Tex Beneke, Ray Eberle & The Modernaires, Paula KellyLet It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! - Woody Herman & His OrchestraWe Wish You the Merriest - Les Brown & His OrchestraSanta Claus is Coming To Town ~ Lester Lanin & His Orchestra"
5,One of best books written on argumentation--EVER,"Billig traces the development of argumentation from Classical times to today, integrating rhetoric, sociology, philosophy, and other disciplines. This book is essential reading for students of argumentation."
5,Another Glenn Ford masterpiece!,"Seems I agree with critic anne on just about anything where this actor is concerned! But in addition to his prowess as a fast gun, watch for the fleeting camera moments that distinguish his acting from others...after he is trapped into shooting his best friend, watch the body language as he bends over the friend, but particularly when he raises his head to look at Bronson and note the shock, pain and grief in his eyes. Also, compare the facial expressions when he is talking to the rancher's wife and when he is talking to his new-found girlfriend. In the former scenes, it appears that he is trying not to be rude, but can't stand her; and in the latter, there is a tenderness that is also seldom seen on the screen. Don't miss this film! It is an above ordinary western!"
4,1956 Western Classic,"Great Cast, Emotional Storyline, Good verses Evil, Lust verses Love, Freindship verses Betrayal, The whole cast went on to great acting careers. Enjoy Jubal! I did!"
5,Great Cowboy Glenn Ford,"Of all the parts he played, I loved Glenn Ford best as a Western cowboy hero. Loved him also in Cade's County on television."
2,Run of the Mill,"Like all those Westerns we used to watch and love when we were kids. Trouble is, that rules many of us out."
3,Undercover...,"When the Brotherhood, an organization that works on keeping the world equal, realizes that something shady is taking place in the world they send in the Undercover Brother, Eddie Griffin. The Undercover Brother has to create a cover, which will transform his attitude and life style to an aloof white man in a polo shirt and loafers. Disguised, the Undercover Brother begins to penetrate the evil source of oppression and he realizes that there are many enemies to face before justice can be served. Undercover Brother is a comedy that flirts with the reality of racial oppression and bigotry that sometimes surfaces in our society. Lee creates a comedy with moments where the comedy reaches the audience with an educational value; however, there are also moments where the hilarious amplification creates an absurdity where the lessons fade away. In the end, the audience is left with a decent cinematic experience."
4,Funny!,"This is a very silly movie, but I like it. It's so over the top. Very funny though. If you are in a mood to watch a silly movie, this is it."
4,70's Afro Flashback,"This movie was hilarious--to me. But I was a member of that generation. Big afro, platform shoes and ""hot pants."" Being a bourgeois black pronouncing my E's and R's, I made them cringe when I said the N-word. So this movie was terribly funny to me. My hat's off to Malcolm Lee for having the courage to make such a film. One IMDB reviewer who complained of having been offended by white jokes doesn't have any idea of just how offensive a great deal of this was to some black viewers. Suggesting that all types of black men, no matter how hip and politically savvy, fantasize about white women took guts. Many people, especially younger ones will not see the humor. But I laughed all the way through it. All power to the people. Right on, my brother."
5,Very Funny!,"This could be considered an Austin Powers rip off, but it is beyond that. The main character, played by Eddie Griffin, dresses like a person out of his time period, but he is not buffoonish. The supporting cast work very well together. Overall, the movie is very funny and not just a ""black"" movie. My fear is that the movie will get dated because of the large amount of current references. Even ""You Go Girl"" is already getting dated."
1,This movie is BLAH!,"First of all let me say that I came in to this movie with high hopes! From the preview it looked funny! Well this movie combines scenes from Austin Powers(I LUV IT) and The Ladies Man(FUNNY)! But it made it horrible. IT is not origanal at ALL! It is also very descrimitive! This movie is not even worth renting let alone seeing. If you are looking for a good teen movie watch ""The New Guy'(5*/5*)"
1,This movie was completely un-called for!,"I usually love these types of movies. This movie was horrible. The whole thing was ""black man"" this and ""black man"" that. If white people made this movie it would be all over front pages talking about racial issues. It makes black people look bad. I would be ashamed of myself if I made this movie. The movie is about black men trying to run for president. Well, that's the beginning of the movie. I was so mad that I turned it off not even 30 minutes into the movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Very taste-less."
1,worst movie ever,"This movie is like a really stupid and cheap version of Austin Powers, but there is one thing that seperates this movie from Austin Powers, and that is comedic value. This movie contains tons of bathroom jokes and racial stereotypes. Undercover Brother is a movie that will probably loose a lot of money at the theaters, since no one over the age of thirteen will find it entertaining."
1,This Movie Is Really Bad,"The title says it all...this movie stinks....I am a huge fan of ""blaxploitation"" movies and I thought by renting this movie that it would give me a few laughs....boy was I wrong....this movie did not even make me laugh once.....this is just a really bad [spin off] of the ""Austin Powers"" genre of movies, and misses the mark on all accounts...the script is bad, the sets are bad...everything is just bad....the only thing remotly good about this film is the cool 70's funky soundtrack...if your thinking of buying this ... don't....if your thinking of renting this...don't...wait for it to come on TBS or something....run ...from ""Undercover Brother""!!"
3,What About Glynn Turman? Or Dorian Harewood,"Props to this flick for mentioning in passing the Seventies cool of Richard Roundtree and Pam Grier. The film has a clever premise in that there is an orchestrated effort to undermine African-American culture a.k.a. ""The Man"" and that there's a need for a covert organization called the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. to assert Black autonomy. But at 90 minutes or so the premise is stretched as far as it can go to the point of tedium. The film is held afloat by the appealing work of Eddie Griffin and the steamy sultriness of Denise Richards but that only goes so far. This would have worked better as a sketch on ""SNL"" or the late lamented Dave Chappelle show who appears here as Conspiracy Brother. I found it kind of ironic that Chi McBride is on hand here. McBride starred in a short-lived series about Lincoln's butler that was protested by varied Afro-American organizations."
5,undercover brother review cover,"The cover above is the correct cover for this movie. Richaerson at the time this movie was made had more credentials than the other actors. However, the African American Actress should not be on the back of the package as in the case of my purchase. The original package should not be changed.Thank you"
4,Undercover Brother Gets the Man,"Growing up watching the Blaxplotation movies of the 70's, I thought that Undercover Brother was very funny, with all the typical sterotypes and cliches. I loved all the Austin Powers series and put this right up there with them."
4,"Funny,Funny",I love Undercover Brother. If you like a good laugh gets this movie. I love Sistah Girl & She-Devil. Not that other characters were great. But they were the standouts. This is a must purchase.
3,Only Fitfully Funny,"A thin premise is stretched to its limits in this black riff on Austin Powers and the Naked Gun movies. Dave Chapelle's Conspiracy Brother is the only consistently funny character, and the storyline often sputters. The big showdown between UB and Feather Man, set to Michael Jackson's ""Beat It,"" is the highlight of the movie, but it comes too late to lift the overall rating out of the doldrums. If Amazon allowed half stars I'd give this 2.5"
2,sorry spoof,"I was disappointed with this movie. To be fair, I don't like spoof movies, especially when the originals are already funny enough. This is a spoof of blaxploitation movies from the 70s. If you want to see the real thing, check out Cleopatra Jones, TNT Jackson, or almost any Pam Grier movie. These movies had a lot of style and the people in them were actually cool. Undercover Brother had people trying to act cool, but it seemed pretty flat to me. Style: none.I was especially disappointed with Chris Kattan's character. I can't think of a weaker villain in any movie, even in spoofs. Dr. Evil? Mogatu? Mr. Feather is a lightweight with very little evil to him, in fact he is boring.There were some fun parts to the movie, but overall I can't really recommend it."
2,The Man speaketh,"As much as I looked forward to seeing this moveie, I hate to say that it was wasted time. This movie tried to really push the jokes but they simply fell flat. Not even the fight between Sista Gurl and She-Devil could save this movie. The blooper feature was even non funny. I tried to laughed, I wanted to find it funny but in the end, I was slightly humored and glad that I borrowed this DVD from a friend."
4,Slap stick? Maybe,"A hilarious laugh if you can get into a culty 70's throw back. There is nothing deep or meaningful about this pix, you just have to get into the characters as strictly comedic takes on old stero types. Don't take the pix personal or become offended by the whacky off beat humor.Definite laugh out loud."
5,What The Funk?,I read a couple of the negative reviews and all I have to say is ARE YOU PEOPLE DEAD OR WHAT! This movie was hilarious. I laughed all the way through. All the characters were on the money and it says a lot about the actors when they can come together and make fun of each other's ethniticity. Maybe there is some hope for society.
3,A fun movie with an awesome soundtrack,"""Undercover Brother"" to me, was like a Black Austin Powers..It had that same brand of humor, and like AP, was a spoof film.I laughed a lot in this movie, and many of the comedies from 2002 didn't even make me crack a smile.This was fun, and I love the soundtrack!! Great 70's music here! ""Play that funky music"", ""Jungle boogie"", ""car wash""(stick around at the end for this one), ""Brickhouse""....just to name a few. I recommend this for a rental.It had some good laughs, and I had a good time watching it and listening to that funky music."
2,It was Aight in spots,"while this Film Wasn't a Knock out all the way it had some moments&Eddie Griffin was Cool in spots.He had Two Hot Foxy Mamma's by His Side so that Helped Matters out.this Film Spoofed ""Charlie's Angels""&""Austin Powers"" but it did it in a Cool Way to Me.I give this Film about a 2.5 for some trip out scenes&things.cool that Billy Dee Williams got in on the Film as well."
4,Great Movie!!,"I just recently watched this, it's really good! I'm surprised at how good it was! It was hilarious, I thought it would just be a bunch of corny jokes, ha!! What was I thinking? This was awesome!! Okay, it's a little bit racist, but used more in a joke style than anything! Undercover Brother(Griffin) is being persued by a bunch of white sexist guys! One of the workers, she devil(Denise Richards) is sent to kill Undercover Brother but instead, falls in love with him! Then, there's Sista Girl(Kattan) and they all end up working together in a big group with some other members, to defeat these white guys, who have kidnapped a famous dark coloured person! It's a good movie, so watch it!!"
4,As good as the previews!,"Usually, when you get the previews for a movie, they delightedly show the funniest parts of the movie. Not so, with Undercover Brother. The writing strikes an extremely fine balance of portraying the racial stereotypes of blacks and whites in a hysterical way. It is able to not only make fun of, but also make us laugh at ourselves and others without being accusatory or tasteless. This is smart comedy, much like we get in ""Who's The Man?"""
4,Undercover Brother is a Classic,"If you are a child of the 60's, 70's or 80's this movie will have you rolling! I predict that it will be a classic. A classic right up there with I'm Going to Get You Sucka! The jokes come so fast you will miss some because you are laughing too hard and won't hear the next lines. This movie will chase the blues away."
4,Flashback Fun!,"Hillarious fun from beginning to end! If you like Raising Arizona, L.A.Story, o Brother Where Art Thou, you will probably get a kick out of Undercover Brother too. Not intellectual, but lots of fun."
4,MUCH BETTER THAN AUSTIN POWERS GOLDMEMBER,"I didnt expect this movie to be very good because of my disopointment with his older movie ""The New Guy"". But it turned out to be very...very amusing. It mixes 70's and 90's jokes a way that works. And this is probably the only movie that uses Micheal Jackson's song Beat It, in a great way to back up the fight scene at the end!!!!And its not bias. It makes fun of both races, but in a funny way."
5,Hi-freakin-larious,"Wonderful off the wall humor, lots of old school references for those of us who remember, and everyone gets targeted equally. Delicious political incorrectness"
5,Good under shirts,"These shirts are great. They're thin enough to not be too hot or bulky under other shirts yet warm enough as a second layer. What I especially like is that there are no itchy tags. My two year old is 37"" tall and wears the size 4/5 so they run a little small. Great buy."
5,review of hanes toddler undershirt,Fit perfectly and will keep him warm underneath his shirts or tshirts! good quality too.
5,How far Down can we go?,"This is as down and dirty as they get. Why is this guy not a star and Britned Spears is? Oh yeh, I remember now. Buy this!!!"
3,Reverend Horton Heat - 'It's Martini Time' (Interscope) 3 1/2 stars,"Basically,if you like good old fashioned straight ahead rockabilly with a 'swing' attitude,you should finding this CD appealing.I've always been sort of a fair weather fan of the Reverend and his rocking trio.This disc is probably one of two of his titles I even have a copy of.The absolute best cut here is without a doubt in my mind ""Now,Right Now"" with other notable tracks being ""Big Red Rocket Of Love""(sounds like a South Park episode,doesn't it?),title cut ""It's Martini Time"",the foot-stomper ""Rock The Joint"" and ""Forbidden Jungle""."
1,Heep Implode!!!,"The album where classic Heep drop the ball, this is even worse than Wonderworld. Heep always were verging on the ridiculous with Byron coming on like a second rate Gillan, Hensley aping Lord etc. At their best it's good stuff but this album is radio rock fodder for the mid 70's, prety uninspired, I mean, what band has the first track without the lead vocalist?I'd recommend Demons and Wizards or Look At Yourself, but this is very poor, Byron's drinking and inter band rivalry had meant the end of the road."
3,Uriah Heep & John Wetton,If John Wetton had been around a little longer with them they might have a bit more recognition today then just Lee Kerslake playing with Ozzy.
3,Poor by Heep standards but some good trax.,"Only buy this if you are seriously hooked on Heep . I was and still am. The overall impression is of a lot of filler on this, and some odd arrangement ideas which one can only assume were an attempt to drag in new non-rock fans. Still, there are a few classics : 'One way or another' is a heavy rocking gem with amazing vocals by John Wetton (+ Hensley section). It is the only true heavy track on the album. Byron gets his turn on the excellent 'Weep in silence' with great Box guitar. There is the almost epic 'Midnight'(let down seriously by a funky small chorus section!}. 'Can't keep a good band down' is a fair rock/pop blast and 'Footprints in the snow' another good Wetton effort being an acoustic/blues mix. Other trax are just not up to scratch. Don't buy this if you want heavy or classic Heep but it does have some good moments."
2,Last album with David Byron.,"Uriah Heep ""High And Mighty"" #161 (1976).9th studio album, ""High And Mighty"". After the success with ""Return To Fantasy"", ""High And Mighty"", is just a shell of that album. It does have a few good numbers in the Hensley tune ""One Way Or Another"", sung by John Wetton and the Hensley, Wetton tune ""Footprints In the Snow"". Most everything here doesn't work for me. David Byron didn't like the direction The Heep was going and he left the band to go solo. David formed Rough Diamond, they released one album in 1977. David passed away in 1985 after years of heavy drinking, he was 38 years old. John Wetton left after this album, he formed U.K.. Everything was new again in 1977 on ""Firefly""."
4,Some of the best Musicians in Rock History,"There are great surprises on every Uriah Heep album especially during the 1970s. My favorite and probably one of the best Heep songs ever is ""Footprints in the Snow"" - this should be a wintertime favorite and played on every rock station in the world - it's that good! ""Weep in Silence"" is a really cool song as well. There's a great rif in ""Midnight"" followed by a really 'bright' organ, too bright in my opinion - that's the only thing I don't like in that particular song. This is the last album with legendary David Byron as the singer."
3,A History of the Bahamas,"This book is good, but not what I had expected it to be. Definitely not a page turner, but does contain a lot of great facts about the Bahamian islands."
4,An excellent release!,"I've been a huge Zao fan for years. Every album that I've ever listened to has totally blown me away. ""The Fear IS What Keeps Us Here"" is no exception. While not as good as ""Where Blood And Fire Bring Rest"" or ""Funeral Of God"", it still is awesome from start to finish. Something that's apparently absent is Russ Cogdell's presence from this album. But the most evident change is Dan's vocals. Instead of his heavily influenced Carcass-style vocals, it has morphed to a harsher, more brutal sandpaper howl. It'll take some getting used to, but I'm sure many people will enjoy this as much as their previous records."
2,Why?,"I have listened to Zao since their first incarnation when they were still hardcore. They have spent many years in the underground, influencing so many other bands, bring their own style of metal to the forefront of the scene. A band that commands this respect, deserves the proper production.I have to say, the material on this album is good, but the production is terrible. This album sounds worse than Save Yourself From Hell. This album could rip the room apart if everything didn't sound like it was buried underneath 6 inches of mud. I can understand the appeal of wanting to be ""real"" or ""raw"" with their recording, but when you take away the clarity of the instruments, you lose the strength of the songs. I really expected a higher level of achivement from them after The Funeral of God, instead they seem to be walking backwards."
3,Ok But Not The Best,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. The album is great. Not doubts about that. However, the vocals just run all over the place and the lyrics repeat throughtout the songs too many times. I found myself saying ""Wait... why is he singing half the song again?"" waaaayy too much. The instuments sound great and extremely well done.The only reason this wasn't given 5 stars was because of the vocals and the repeating lyrics. I'm a really big fan of Parade Of Chaos and The Funeral Of God. This doesn't stand up to it."
2,Going nowhere fast.,"I must say that after Parade Of Chaos I wasn't too excited about Zao anymore. Funeral Of God didn't excite me but it grabbed my interest. The Fear That Keeps Us Here didn't do much more. Although their songwriting is as tight as ever I found myself being unable to tell the difference between songs. Everything seemed jumbled and chaotic, although that can be a good thing at times it wasn't in this case. I have been a long time fan of Zao (going on a decade now) but it seems that after Self-Titled Zao lost something. I still love this band to death (they put on one of the best live shows i've ever seen) but i'm hoping and praying they can rekindle the fire from their earlier days. And I must say this, Where Blood And Fire Bring Rest was and probably always will be Zao's best effort so it will take alot from them to get my jaw dropping again."
2,Kindle version = very small. How can people even read this?,"I purchased the kindle version of this book, and I think I'm going to have to buy a magnifying glass to enjoy it! I wish I had just purchased the hard copy now because this kindle version will be useless to my students. I bought this in hopes that it might help my students who will have difficulty with the standard text. The writing in the kindle comic is very small. Other than that it looks great, but it seems there is nothing that can be done to make the image appear bigger on the standard (non DX) Kindle. Also, every other page is blank, which makes clicking through the book awkward. I wonder if I can get a refund to go toward the purchase of a hard copy of this book."
5,perfect visual representation of the original,"this graphic novel version of kafka's metamorphosis does every bit of justice to the original novella. the artwork is heavy on the black ink, giving it the perfect amount of darkness, yet gregor's antagonists are portrayed comically -- their facial expressions fit their shallow characters perfectly.i dont know much about kafka's original intent with metamorphosis (as another reviewer pointed out, it is supposed to be a ""comedy"") but the theme of alienation, existentialist despair, and injustice are consistent with his other works, most notably the trial. gregor samsa, like josef k, is turned into a ""vermin"": for no obvious reason, he is condemned to be the victim of hostility and rejection. both protagonists have done nothing to deserve their fate. this existentialist theme reoccurs in camus' the stranger, sartre's the flies, and hamson's hunger, just to name a few.the ""absurd"" should not be miscontrued as ""comic."""
4,Review of Kuper's 'Metamorphosis',"This is a fair adaptation of Kafka's original work. It is filled with the mood of a Kafka short-story. This short, readable piece would be a great introduction to Kafka for high school students (with a supplementary introduction on Kafka, which this work does not provide)."
3,Buggin' Out,"Adapted from the nightmarish short story from early 20th-century author Franz Kafka, Peter Kuper's graphic novel version breathes new life into angst-ridden hero Gregor Samsa, an overworked young salesman who finds himself getting stepped on--figuratively--after waking up as a giant cockroach. While Kuper's writing seems simple enough, he also decorates the word bubbles to further distinguish each character. And what characters this book has! While the reader may find the Samsa family's reaction to Gregor's transformation to be natural, he/she may actually find Gregor's treatment to be deplorable regardless. And the rough black/white artistic style Kuper brings to the table merely adds the mood for an already dark, dreary story. A nightmare that goes on long after you wake up.This comic is unrated: Adult Situations."
5,Australian cooking with Australian ingredients,"This is a fabulous book that I have been using this book since 1995, when I purchased two copies for my daughters as a good looking basic cookbook. There are many good descriptions and methods in the book and I finally discovered how to make a pumpkin pie American style without canned pumpkin. It's fabulous to have a cookbook that has Australian ideas for cooking with Australian ingredients. I have resorted to coming to Amazon.com to get a third copy for myself."
5,the full monty,"I've taken a couple of Prof. Kaeuper's courses, and I got what I expected in this book. I can't speak for professional historians, but I can say that his style accomodates those less familiar with the time period. Indeed, you might find it to be kind of a grind at first, because the emphsais is on strict historical evidence rather than on any prevailing romantic notions about chivalry. This often dissapoints beginning students in this area, but I gurantee that the energy put in leaves one far more gratified. The reader can get a clear sense that the ""Dark Ages"" were immensely complex and active, and that this thing we call ""chivalry"" is essential to Western history -even the Western present- and is by no means something people did just so we can watch nifty movies."
1,RIP-OFF!!,"This product is still a Boot-legged rip-off. Before buying this DVD, ask yourself:1) You only get the first 6 episodes on the 1 disc. For $14 + S & H ($5?) x 5 discs (total discs they were telling us would eventually be available) = $100 for a bootlegged series. Isn't that too expensive?2) The show is owned by Disney. Why is it being distributed only through Lacewing Media?3) Who is Lacewing Media?4) Why is there no web-site for this supposed ""studio"", Lacewing Media?5) They were selling this as a boxed set, with only the first DVD, for $25 + S & H. What happened to the box?I'll tell you what happened. They got so many bad reviews, they removed that offer and put up this new one, without the box. Now all the old reviews are gone."
5,Great Referance,"This book is very helpful when trying to learn about the TI-83 & 84 calculator, although there is a lot to learn, if you use the book with the calculator it becomes very easy, a very good referance manual"
4,Muy buen disco de bachata!,"Este es un muy buen CD de bachatas. Este joven dominicano tiene mucho talento, como cantante y como compositor. Los mejores temas del disco son ""Enamorado De Ti"" y ""Quiero Besarte"". Es un bueno disco para todo aquel que le gusta la bachata.Si te gusta la bachata, aqui hay algunas recomendaciones: ""Bachata Rosa"" de Juan Luis Guerra, ""Decidida"" de Sonya Cortes, ""Hoja En Blanco"" de Monchy & Alexandra y por ultimo uno de los mejores ""Tesoros De Mi Tierra"" de Milly Quezada."
3,"Dirty-shirt cowgirl, private eye boomer chases serial killer","Sinclair Browning knows intimately the territory about which she writes: The Arizona desert,the work of a rancher, the Indian rituals kept me interested."
1,The Girls of Lighthouse...,Very poor writing and not appropriate for the age level.Suggestive and depressing. I returned this book.
3,"Cute, fast read","Very basic story, but the characters are endearing, and it was very sweet. This is great for young teenage girls."
2,Cheaply made,"The item is very cheaply made, falls apart at the hinges easily (when I am working with it), it does not latch shut from the moment I put it together on Christmas morning and the enclosed Doc Hudson is missing an eye. Really really poorly made."
1,This toy is not portable.,"We bought this toy for a Christmas present. My almost 6 year old was extremely frustrated with the toy. It was not easy to pack up, the commerical shows a fold and go process. It was a process all right, if you did get it packed up the hooks on top did not keep the semi trailer closed, thus everything fell out when you tried to drive it. The whole toy is a good thought but poorly executed. Toy makers should really test these items on children before selling them."
1,"Agree with the negatives, wish I'd listened to them","How disappointing. This toy is flimsy and not well designed. The launcher is too powerful for the short distances McQueen must go, the various activities do not stay together or lay flat, closing it is difficult. Some time ago, I bought a littleTake Along Fire Station Playsetfor my son and it lasted two years. This is a far better concept toy, many more activities, far more sturdier, easy and intuitive to put together. Even though it looks more complicated, my son could put it together at two. At nearly five, he can't put the Mac Playset together so it works. The fire station toy isn't Lightning McQueen, but my son loved it and played hard with it for a long time before its hinges gave out. And it's cheaper than this piece of junk."
4,Mack Playtown,"I bought this for my grandson, who is almost 4 years old. It was relatively easy to assemble, but I don't think it will stand up to many hours of playtime; it seems a bit shakey in that department. Everything on it is plastic, which a lot of toys are these days, but it didn't seem to be a very sturdy plastic. He was thrilled when he got it, of course, but it remains to be seen how long it will last. Thank You for the opportunity to speak about this."
4,pixar semi,"I was disappointed in the size of the semi cab. It looked larger in the photo. It looks like it should be for a trailor much smaller. However, I purchased it for my grandson and he loved it."
3,"cute, but what a hassle.","My son loves it, but I have to put it together, put it away, fix it... constantly. I got it for him for his 3rd birthday and he was thrilled. It's a great idea, thus the 3 stars, but poorly executed.It is very hard to put together and put away.Also, the 'Drift with Doc' area is pretty silly... the cars do not fit properly on the curves, so they get stuck when you push them around the road.I would not recommend this, but I do not regret buying it."
1,HUGE Dissapointment!,"I bought this for my 6 yr old son who LOVES CARS. The toy is extremely hard to keep together and put away. It breaks easily. The only 2 good things is Bessie and Mac the Truck, his trailer is horrible and is now in the trash where it belongs! I don't believe much thought was put in to the durability of this toy. To be played with it must be opened but the opening mechanism does not work as an expensive toy should. I strongly do not recommend this toy get the smaller mac truck it is a much better toy."
1,Don't waste you $$$$,"I could not agree more with the review titled ""Ughhh!!! Nothing works on this toy and like the other reviewer my son can not play with it by himself. He is crying every five minutes to help him put it back together which is something two college educated adults struggle in doing. We are returning it and recommend you not to waste you time or money!!!"
2,All of the above. . .,"I agree with all the previous reviews whole-heartedly! This is a piece of junk. There is no way a child could put this back together on their own, it takes both my husband and I to do it. . . . one holding the sides together and one arranging items inside so will close all the way - only to have it fall back apart as were gingerly putting it away in the closet. Also on ours, the sound doesn't work. I would just return it, but our son has been asking for this for weeks and finally got it for his 4th birthday. He would be heart broken if we returned it. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that he does enjoy playing with it once it is all set up - even without the sound, but I would suggest spending your money elsewhere."
3,Cheaply Made!,"I was really disappointed! It is very hard for my 5 yr old to open this up and hook it up correctly to get all of the sounds that it is suppose to do. It also keeps falling apart! Very frustrating! After about 15 min. or so of playing with it my son was bored of it because it really doesn't do much. For 49.00, it should be made better."
4,My kid love's it,It's a full playground for my kid with a collection of 20 or so Disney Pixar Cars vehicles. Everything packs in trailer and unpacks very easly. It is the best Mack character I've seen around.
3,My son loves it!!!,"My son really enjoys this toy, but often gets frustrated when it doesn't stay together well. It can be aggravating--you have to get it just right for the trailer not to fall apart easily. I had to figure out on my own how the trailer locks together. It can be tricky! My son is good at figuring out how things work so the frustration doesn't come as frequently as when he first got it for Christmas."
2,Not the best performance playset,"The concept is great and looked like a lot of fun, but my nephew lost interest faster than I could put it together for him. IT was not easy to put it together and packing it all away wasn't so great either. When the truck is put together and locked together, it inevetibly popped apart spilling out the contents. When it was opened up the sides fell off or the scenery fell apart. The cars are cool and the talking part as good, but over all, it was a disppointment"
2,Very Frustrating,"Every year we seem to manage to pick one toy that frustrates everyone. This was ours for the year. It took my husband about an hour to put this together. As soon as he handed it over to my 4 year old son, it fell open. It will not stay together, and I've yet to be able to fit all the pieces and parts into it. My son does like playing with it when it's open, but one of the features I was looking forward to was it ""self-storing"". That DOES NOT work at all. If you don't mind it open all the time, you may like this, because it pops open if you so much as look at it!"
1,NOT WONDERFUL,"The fact that there is an age reccomendation on this toy has nothing to do with the fact that it is a piece of junk. I dont care if they toy is made for a 12 year old that is good at putting stuff back together, toys should not FALL APART every time the child opens it to play with it. It is confusing and actually pretty boring. When we asked my son what he wanted for CHristmas he always said "" Big Mack truck"" so someone got it for him and he doesnt even play with it because it falls apart and he gets frustrated. The best part about the truck is that it comes with Bessie which you cannot just buy. This toy should be re designed or discontinued!"
1,Mattel Disney Pixter Cars Pitcrew Performance Playset,"I can not understand how this Toy could have possible been accepted by the Mattel Quality Control and Engineering Departments.This toy is a piece of JUNK! The plastic is flimsy,the backdrop scenery panels keep falling off when cars go around the race track, or if you even breath on it, and closing it will forget it!! It does't close, it keep's popping open. I have spent hours trying to make this work, the toy is a complete failure. I can tell you this, the whole trailer is going in the trash, and will only keep the cab. If I had read the other reviews on this product I would not have purchased it. I hope I save someone else's money."
1,can not recommend,I bought this truck for my grandson age 4 for Christmas because he was asking for it. I know the rcommended age was for 7+. However neither his mother or father were unable to open and close this truck. It is bulky and cheaply made despite its way to high price of $94. My grandson was frustrated and asked why Santa would make a toy like that. It now sits in his bedroom gathering dust.
1,"crap crap, did I mention crap?","See the review titled UGGHH, it's a very accurate summary. This truck is a nice concept, horrible execution. The pieces that are supposed to fold out are almost impossible to get to stay in their deployed positions, when you try to fold it up to create the truck, the sides do not fold easily (frustrating everyone who tries) and fall easily. The launcher is difficult to pop in place and has to be pulled out in order to fold the truck up. There's nothing but frustration in store for the parents and children that have this toy."
1,disappointing,"This truck looked like so much fun, but we're really disappointed. The pieces of the truck do not stay together, whether set up as a race track, or in truck form. It's very frustrating for me, let alone my son. I'm about to throw the whole thing away."
1,VERY Poor Construction/Quality,"Too bad Mattel didn't spend as much money on the design/construction of this toy as they did advertising it to our kids! My 6 year old son kept seeing the commercials for this toy and it was ""all he wanted!"" We bought it for him and within ten minutes the toy was broken. We couldn't latch the back parts of Mack's truck. With it unlatched, my son couldn't ""drive"" it around the floor. My very upset son got frustrated when I told him I was going to take it back. What a waste of my time and money Mattel!"
1,Terrible - don't buy!,"Where to start with this piece of junk? Firstly setting it up is hard. It is fiddly and the instructions are not very clear. More worryingly, once it is set up the pieces don't fit together well and don't work well even when an adult is working it. My 5 year old couldn't make it work. This is a design fault. My 7 year old could make it work with great effort and patience but soon gave up and moved on to some Lego. Even my 11 year old was baffled by the poor mechanics. The scenery pieces don't fit properly and fall off constantly. The final insult is that the pieces are supposed to fit into Mack when he is back to being a truck but despite great effort Mack keeps falling open and doesn't close. Absolutely rubbish and at a rip off price!"
5,Brilliant Examination of the Realm of Transport Logistics,"Mr. Issa Baluch's book brings the topic of transportation logistics to an understandable level through both his well-researched historical examples and his expert analysis of present and future methods of transport. His intelligent interpretation of modern logistics in areas such as industry, military, relief, and global growth is invaluable as a learning and reference tool to any individual or group that is interested or involved in the study of transport logistics. In short, ""Transport Logistics"" is brilliant work that enables a reader to be captivated by the historical methods of transport and to be informed of the present and future use of logistics."
4,The 3Ps of the the Logistics World,"Mr. Baluch using the 3Ps (Past, Present and Predictions) and drawing on his years of experience as an FLP (Freight Logistic Providers), guides the reader using real life examples of past, what is happening presently and the what needs to change in the future in the world of FLPs. He highlights the challenges of planning and execution in the world of FLPs. I like his focus on transportation security problems of today and his recommendations on what can be done in this area to make the world a more secure place to conduct business. An excellent reference and training material for FLPs."
4,"Transport Logistics Past, Present, and Predictions","The book is very well written, and Issa uses historical references to show the importance of logistics. He also points out some failures, and conversely some success stories; the Panama Canal example comes to mind.I would equate the book with case studies of logistics throughout history, with some keen insights into the future of logistics and the technologies that will take us there. I would recommend the book to anyone involved in the transportation / logistics industry."
2,stickers not reusable in my opinion,"The illustrations are cute. But, the stickers tear fairly easily and do not not stick well for storage or reuse. You might get 2 play sessions out of this product."
5,Excellent projector for the money,"I absoutely love this projector. I have used it in our home theater for over a year now and could not be more pleased. Excellent picture, installed easily and works great with all of our AV equpipment."
2,Pros and Cons?,Pros:1. Great Contrast.2. One of the least expensive projectors with lens shift.Cons:1. Not the brightest projector out there.2. Only has a 2000 hour bulb.Consider the Mitsubishi HC1500 or the Panasonic PT-AX200 instead and be sure to read my reviews on them too.Hope this helps get your RealHomeTheaters off the ground!
5,LOVE this!,"This is my most favorite boots at the moment! If I can get my hands on all the colors I will! It's comfy inside and I just slip my feet in, without opening the zippers, just truly adorable! oh, and they shipped fast too."
4,Love em,"Sexy, tough ass looking.... THese are good for work or play. I love them, You can dress them up or down. Very nice"
3,Calf too tight,"I have larger calves, and these booted were too tight. The boots themselves were nice-looking, but if they don't fit, then I can't wear them. Sent them back and got another pair. Hopefully those will fit better."
1,Badly made boots!,The quality of the boots were horrible! The straps were stitched with orange threads. The shafts that were put on the soles were of two different sizes and werent for that size sole. The heels on the insides were just thrown together. Bunched up and folded leather that hurt the heel. I was not impressed with this product. I wouldn't give it one star.
1,Piece of Junk,Unit died just after end of one-year warranty. While Haier offered to replace the unit at close to its original price (including shipping) I won't take a chance on the product again given other customer experiences. I highly recommend purchasing a different brand.
1,BUYER BEWARE OF HAIER!!!!!,"AVOID THIS COMPANY!! My unit arrived broken. Haier customer service was rude & obnoxious. They were completely unapologetic & seemed to go out of their way to be UNHELPFUL. When I finally bullied them into action, they wanted a full week to send out a service man who may or may not have been able to fix it. I spoke to both customer service and corporate, both were extremely rude and entirely useless. What's more, neither one had the decency to so much as apologize. NEVER AGAIN.This was every internet buyer's nightmare!"
2,When it works it is great,I also got their product and it died after a few months.I did get a replacement which took a while and they needed all the information you can think of before they would send the replacement.But after another couple of months the new one died too. I will not bother wasting my time trying to replace it again.But when it works it is a perfect size and it is very quiet.
1,another dud,"I purchased this unit in Jan 2010, it is dead now after 1 year and 1 month.Seems like Haier designed these with just enough quality to last for one year so the warranty is over and then they die.Pretty dumb."
1,Waste of money!,"We had ours delivered as a wedding present. It ran constantly and never cooled off. When I called Hairer they told me to return it to the store. I explained the circumstances and they acted as if I didn't even have one. Then wanted me to pay to have the new unit shipped as well as cut of at least 8 inches of the power cord, remove the sticker on the back of the unit and ask my wifes work for a recipt. When I did they sent me another one that didn't work at all! I'm not paying for more junk and you shouldn't either."
1,Do not buy Haier products,I have owned our Haier wine cellar for about a year and a half. It is now broken. It now longer gets cool. I just called the company to get repair advice. They basically suggested that I just buy a new one. This is irresponsible. This company should be investigated. They need to make products that don't break down and if they do offer decent customer service to get it repaired..not just to buy a new one..and put more trash in our landfills. I WILL NEVER BUY A HAIER PRODUCT AGAIN.
1,One for the trash heap.,Mywine cooler lasted just past the warranty then died. A fuse on the back panel burnt out. It costs more to repair it than to buy a new one.
1,Big fizzle,"Mine worked fine for 3 months, then died a sudden death. It stopped cooling, but the fan still ran. It is not a deceptive on/off cycling as has been alluded to by one happy customer. It just plain croaked, suddenly. Ventilation was adequate. There was no recourse but to trash it."
1,Haier 12 bottle wine cellar,"This product lasted the 3 months that the warranty covered then promptly died. Smelt like an electrical connection burned out, then nothing. Save your money, buy better wine & use the refrigerator."
3,Not really for beginners,"This CD won't help much if you really are a beginner. I find it reasonably helpful, but only because I have done about 12 months of courses and am using it for revision.One irritant is some of the questions and answers they teach you. Things like:How much do you earn? I earn a large salary.Very bizarre. A bit too American for most people's tastes."
3,"Great premise, some nice work, needs salt though.","Digital Beauties has a great premise, exposing the world to digital artists who create visions of women in dynamic, flattering or erotic representations. There are several high points in this book, Works by Daniel Scott Murray, Will Kramer and Frans Mensink top the list, but save for 3 or 4 other artists, the rest us very amateur at best. Some are downright questionable as to talent or design. However the work that is the top of the pile is just that, very nice.Having been in the design world for some time, I know just how difficult it is to create the human form in a 3d environment and not have it look like a lifeless object. Some of the artists as mentioned, pull this off beautifully, others...eh. The book is laid out well from a design prospective with short but interesting bios on the featured artists.Bottom line...10% of the work is beautiful, I just wish the rest of the book kept up.I'd advise having it in hand to review before purchasing."
1,Simply Awful,"The thing that occurred to me while perusing the digital beauties in this book was that 90% of the ""artists"" paid to be included. With the exception of 3 or 4 of them, they don't even measure up to talented amateurs. There is one guy that is embarassingly bad. I won't mention names.If you want the cream of this crop, screen capture the book cover and let the rest go. Don't waste your money... I'm sorry I had to give it a star at all."
4,Good Boots!,Pretty good boots. Been wearing them for a few years now. I build houses so I'm pretty tough on them. I'd say they last about a year to a year and a half before the sole wears out. I like the wedge heel because a regular heel might catch on things when I'm framing second floors or roof rafters.
2,Poorly Cut,"The cut of the shirt was weird, the neck hole was too large and the sleeves come almost down to the elbow. Characters on the shirt were colored red and green when picture shows them as being black. The shirt is more school bus yellow/orange than ths shirt shows. My wife has adopted it as a sleep shirt."
5,Take Time for the Sacred,"Millions of people around the world have benefitted from the experience of praying on a daily basis with the interactive web site ""Sacred Space"". In my own daily prayer rituals, my reading of the day's scriptures at Sacred Space creates a quiet time for reflection and contemplation. Now, through this new book, the same experience is available without the need for a computer.Organized around weekly themes, the readings for each week actually commence with the new liturgical calendar in November, 2004. A reflection at the beginning of each week supplements the daily readings and questions. Whether you are looking to establish a daily prayer ritual or to enhance your existing spiritual journey, you will benefit from this wonderful book."
4,Sacred Space 2008,I have found Sacred Space a good resource for my daily prayer and meditation. The format at the beginning of each week gives a simple and inspiring framework for prayer. The questions following the daily scripture reading are unique and helpful.
5,JAOG book order,"The book was received in very good condition. The video material was used in my Apologetics class, and I wanted to read the book on my own. Excellent apologetic material, excellent for spiritual growth as well. Ravi Zacharias is gifted with an amazing mind!"
3,Not the worst I've read but far from the best.,"I'm a Christian so I'm not saying this because of mere prejudice. The book in my opinion was very poorly organized and I think would fail to be of worth to anyone who is not already a Christian. The book is of slight worth to Christians, but there are far better books to spend your money on. His arguments would not convince me that any of the religions he mentions are wrong if I happened to be a member of that particular group. I wouldn't say the whole book is junk; some of it is pretty good, but is sadly overwhelmed by the the not so good. I heard many good things about Mr. Zacharias and purchased this in high hopes of some great apologetics and profound insight. He leaves much to be desired."
3,Complicated at Times,"This was a gift from my father (a devote Christian) for Christmas '03. I recieved it ironically and consequently after I told him ""his religion has proven nothing to me""... I think he took it pretty hard.Anyhow I read the book, and was kind of dissapointed. At times it's hard to read and other times it seems as if it meanders so far from the point. There is actually very little compare/contrast of other religions, it's predominately ""Jesus is best because..."". The ideas R. Zacharias presents seem fairly logical from a theological perspective, he is definately a convincing author, yet once again the lack of comparison (which is assumed by the title) just doesn't cut the bill.Overall it's not a bad book, just don't be fooled by the title."
2,A glimpse at apologetics,"This book is an attempt at apologetics, but I wasn't very impressed. This title implies that I should be able to understand the major differences as a result of the reading. Instead, one gets a few pieces of the puzzle with a lot of verbage to fill the page. I can't see how anyone but the ignorant signing up to Christianity with the use of this text. At best, one can hope that an unsaved reader would seek out something much more detailed."
5,thoughtful... and helpful,"I am an avid reader of Christian apologetics... and have never read anything quite like this before. I was really amazed at some of the simple yet profound ideas presented by Zacharias. He reminded me that there is more to one's religion than theology... that the basis of one's religion is one's God. Before anyone dares defend his faith, I challenge him to really examine the God at the center of that faith. I believe that ""Jesus Among Other Gods"" really helps the Christian grasp how wonderous Jesus is."
4,Good book for the already Christian believer,"This is a great book from a highly intellectual Christian apologetic philospher. If you are already a believer in Jesus and want to strengthen your testimony on questions such as ""Why choose Christiany? Why does God allow suffering? Aren't we all just instances of random chance in a big bang universe?"" This is a wonderful guide. However, it is a 'tough' book to read for the average reader. I found myself rereading many paragraphs to get the gist of what he was saying. Once I understood, great stuff, but it is not a casual read. And as another reviewer points out, other books may be better suited to those initially seeking the truth of God. I highly recomend this book. It has stregthened my testimony. Just be ready to take your time when reading and fully absorb his message."
4,"Good, but title may mislead you","This is a good book, but unlike what the title suggests, it is not a comparison of Christianity with other religions. (For that, I recommend Stephen Neill's book, Christian Faith and Other Faiths, published in the 1950s.) This is more of a personal testimony of why Ravi Zacharias chose Christ rather than the alternatives. As in all of Zacharias' work, there is strong emphasis on the intellectual coherence of Christian faith and on the relation of belief to emotion -- what you believe determines how you are entitled to feel about things."
4,A solid claim for Jesus,Ravi Zacharias defends the message of Jesus against other religions. He starts out with his personal journey then he procedes to compare Jesus amonst other religions. He mainly focuses on the claim of non believers or skeptics. He states that it is both the Christian who uses his mind to trust God and the skeptic who uses his mind to disbelieve in God and demands a sign as proof of his existence. He states that the christian faith is not a leap in the dark but a well placed faith in Jesus. He also states that many skeptics disbelieve in God because of evil. Ravi Zacharias argues that in order for us to proclaim something evil there need to be a moral absolute to compare it to this evil. You cannot have evil without good.
1,Christian gives it the thumbs down...,"If you're not a Christian, don't read it. If you are a Christian, strongly consider not reading it. I read it for a class and came away with nothing but a bad taste in my mouth.Zacharias has a unique way of writing a lot, while actually saying very little. I read it a second time hoping that maybe I was just in a bad mood the first time around, but it really didn't make me feel any better about the book."
4,Good read,"Brilliant defense of Christianity as well as reason, logic, and intellect in the face of modern man's self destructive irrationality"
4,Informational but not quite accurate to the title,"I did enjoy this book. It was very informational and included many good details and arguments. However, the title, ""Jesus among other gods"" implies a more historical perspective and critical comparison of Jesus to other well-known ""gods"". In terms of comparison, it is very speratic and unorganized and contains only a small amount of historical information. Overal a good book, but not as accurate to the title as I would have liked."
5,Please evaluate this book in context!,"I've read many previous reviews that object to the fact that this is ""not a true comparative study"" or that it is ""not objective and biased"". Please remember that the title is ""Jesus Among Other Gods"" not ""A bunch of Other Gods""--it was Ravi's intention to place Jesus as the centerpoint of the conversation, and this fact was even disclosed in the opening chapter. There are many great books out there that are created to objectively contrast the world religions, but this is not one of those books. I would especially recommend this book to an analytical Christian who may have been brought up as a Christian and who is searching for answers to the question ""Why do I believe what I believe?"". In America, this is a widely prolific problem, from my perspective. Again, if this book is read and evaluated in its proper context, it is a wonderful work that will offer insight after insight."
5,Clancy returns!,"Tom Clancy returns with a second Jack Ryan novel, which goes more into the character's backstory than was developed in ""Hunt for Red October."" A great novel, with lots of twists and turns that makes it a far more complex novel than ""Red October,"" although not quite as good as the latter. Still, well worth the money and time. Just don't buy the paper back, it's far too long a book for that."
5,best version,"I originally bought this for Azam Ali's voice but I found my favorite ""tranced"" version of Rhys Fulber's, Conjure One, ""Center of the Sun"" cut. It is beautiful."
5,Tried and True,"It is always a delight to pick up a children's book and read some of the rhyming that I have heard for years. This work is full of tiny tales such as ""Little Boy Blue,"" and a fun one called, ""Cow, Cow."" My granddaughter and I giggled our way through this little book. The illustrations set off the writing.It was very enjoyable for both of us."
3,A great disappointment.,"As a long-time Colin Dexter fan, I looked forward to a long auto trip while listening to this book. Beware, all ye of similar expectations. This is not Colin at his best, or even average. None of the stories is very interesting, most are easily solved, (if you care enough to try), none is suspenseful. I had the feeling these stories were rejects from other publications. The Sherlock Holmes story is just dumb. Don't bother with this one."
3,"Morse is OK, but Dr. Watson shines.","Fans of Dexter's Inspector Morse series will probably be a little disappointed by this book, since only five of the ten collected stories actually have the cantankerous Thames Valley detective, and with a few exception those stories tend to be the shorter entries of the batch. But still, this is a very readable collection of mysteries and other crime stories, one which as a whole tends to lean more toward the light-hearted rather than the serious. Probably the high point of the collection is not a Morse story but a Sherlock Holmes tale, in which the perrenially overshadowed Dr. Watson finally gets a little bit of recognition.Overall not a stellar collection, but easily an enjoyable lazy afternoon's read."
4,A Wonderful Nod to Watson,"While I am a great Morse fan and enjoyed the short stories involving Thames Valley's finest, I particularly enjoyed Dexter's turn at Sherlock Holmes. I was truly impressed with his ability to emmulate Doyle's literary style and to capture the essence of those well-loved characters. But, what I loved most about this short story was the wonderful ending and Watson's role in it! Dexter's homage, though loving, also manages to poke a little fun at the greatest literary detective."
3,Short Morse,When I purchased this book I didn't read the description closely enough to realize this was a collection of multiple short stories. Some of the stories don't even involve Morse (including a new Sherlock Holmes tale). They are very enjoyable but the format doesn't leave space for the full development of characters and plot of the novels.
2,Great expectations poorly expressed.,This collection is definitely not Dexter at his best. The book reads like the sort of thing he does when he is thoroughly bored and has nothing better to do. If you must insist upon reading it borrow the book from your local library. It is a good way to catch Morse on one of his off days.
3,Morse's NOT greatest Mysteries!,"Morse's Greatest Mystery and Other Stories (Inspector Morse) by Colin Dexter is collection of short stories. I have read many of his full length novels and been captivated by his writing style, his plots and of course Morse and Lewis. (These characters played by John Thaw and Denis Whatley in the TV drama brought them alive, they became real people). On the whole I was disappointed with this book, I felt most of the stories were shallow and at times honestly wondered if Dexter had actually written them! The stories felt like cast offs, or the seed of an idea that was never developed and completed in haste."
1,Boredom reigns,"I had not previously read anything by Dexter, whose work has been praised by many. The reasons for that praise are nowhere evident in this sorry collection of plodding tales. The characters are cardboard; the ""plot twists"" seem based on the author's mistaken belief that telling a boring story, and revealing at the end that something else was really going on, somehow makes the first 90% interesting. The Sherlock Holmes -- what, pastiche? parody? -- I think ""theft"" is the right description. Of course it sounds like Doyle -- most of the text has been lifted verbatim, and Dexter's additions simply detract from Doyle's great work. The author may be clever and entertaining, but I'm not going to waste my time reading any more of his work on the chance that might be so."
1,You're all Stupid,"Anyone who likes ""Let's Get It Started"" should be kicked swiftly in the groin. Elephunk is an inferior Black Eyed Peas album to begin with, although it has some quality songs on it. ""Let's Get Retarded"" was an excellent song until they changed the lyrics for the NBA, and MTV decided that it was more radio friendly than the original. I'm certainly not looking forward to the next Peas album."
4,Easy and fun reading,This book is fun and simple to read. It reads like those familiar Dr. Seuss Cat in the Hat books. My children love dinosaurs and enjoy reading this book over and over.
3,Good Read,"I was pleasantly surprised that this throw back book from my in laws closet presented some great topics to talk about. Death, love, faith, friendship, and taking the hard road in life are all topics from this book.I suggest for preschool to 2nd Grader this is a good read aloud book especially if they like dinosaurs. I admit it I cried. I am a baby. So be warned.I give this book 3.5 out of 5 stars.[...]"
3,"good info, bad writing","I've read this mag a couple times, and found some useful info. It's unfortunate that it's necessary to get past the cliched writing and ridiculous metaphors in the articles before getting to the meat. A good editor could make this into a magazine I'd subscribe to."
1,...,Very pretty; looks great on any cell phone...however it broke within a couple of days! I was very disappointed that all it took is putting it in my pocket to break it. Definately not worth the money.
2,more complicated then neccessary,I read this book as well as was a student of Larry Rittenburg at the UW-Madison. If his teaching were not as solid his book would seem confusing and uninformitive to any other reader. This book seems to have been hurried to the market to compete with his fellow professors. I would recommend a more straight forward and interesting text one that better represents the Audit practice.
1,Very difficult to follow for first-time auditing students,"This book is very confusing for beginning auditing students. This is my first auditing course and I'm having a difficult time completing the homework because I don't understand what is being asked of me. If I had previous auditing experience it might make a little more sense, but it seems like the author is repeating a lot of stuff over and over in the first few chapters without really explaining what you're supposed to be doing. It all seems very abstract, which makes it difficult to apply what you're learning to the homework. If you're looking for an indtroductory book to auditing, I would not recommend this one."
5,<Pig> is awesome!!!,"I am a huge fan of Nine Inch Nails, and I think <Pig> Sinsation is an excellent album to buy. I wish more people knew about <Pig>, but I guess <Pig> just wants to be big in Japan and not the U.S.A. Maybe my review will turn things around?"
5,If you like /\/I\/\ you will like pig,"I bought this cd and I was definately not dissapointed. This cd gave me a new feeling and appreciation for music. Some of the songs are a little disturbing, But a great sound nevertheless. Pig's style is a bit inbetween the style of nin and marilyn manson."
2,What so great about this CD?,"I was expecting some heavy, dark, and noisey music. From all the reviews I read, it sounded like a great cd. But in fact, it is not. It lacks intensidy, compresion, and diversity. Only 3/10 songs from this cd are worth listending to; #2, #6, #9. Also, 3 songs are just musical, leaving only 7 songs in total. If it wasn't for his voice, the name band would be meaningless. HE has a great voice but doesnt fully utilizes it in this cd. Maybe in another cd it does greatly but not in this one. Also, there noting great special about the music. It just doesn't jump at you like it doest with NIN. Never the less, his cds are still quite interesting and i will give the band another try with another cd. Maybe pigmata or American Monster.2332"
4,Great Kitchen Towels,"I love everything flamingo-themed, so I bought these towels for my kitchen. The actual color is darker than pictured (less vibrant also), but it still works with my decor. They are absorbent, and work great. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five: When you first unwrap the towels, the ""new/packaged"" smell is overwhelming. You definitely need to wash these first before you use them. The upside is the smell went away after one wash."
3,Good plot but a few dislikes!,"This 3rd book in the Shenandoah Sisters has a good plot and for the most part is good.But I did not like the violence and the lying.Have we forgot the Ten Commandments:""Thou shalt not kill.""?And in the Epistles""Lie not one to another""?It is just wrong!The truth will always stand the thing is when will you beleive it?"
5,Biblical Studies and Archaeology,"This symposium provides the reader with a breadth of opinion on the archaeological evidence and interpretation in Jerusalem. The editors have brought together the work of biblical scholars and archaeologists with diverse opinions about how to interpret archaeology and the relation of findings to biblical texts. Authors deal with Jerusalem from the Bronze Age through the end of the first temple period. Not a text I would recommend to the novice. Some basic understanding of major archaeological features of the city and Hebrew Bible, especially (1 Samuel thru 2 Chronicles) are required."
3,Not the Best of Dickens But Still a Good Read,"First, I would like to mention that the Kindle edition has a problem with quotation marks - many are missing. That fact creates a bit of a problem for the reader, but I got used to it after the first couple of chapters.Second, the novel itself is not the best that Dickens has to offer. Paul Dombey is not a likable character, but Dickens doesn't really explore the character as much as he should have. The real lead character is Florence Dombey, his neglected daughter. The novel would have been much better had Dickens explored some of the relationships more in depth. Some of the other characters are also overly chatty and annoying to the point of distraction.Overall, it's a good book with much of the same attention to social issues of most of Dickens' works."
3,Slow moving but still essential Dickens,"Despite this novel being one of Dickens' least read and least known novels, it is definitely not a lost classic. It is typical, in a Dickensian way, but it is also very slow.The pace of the novel lags due to the fact that: (a) it is a typically long ""loose baggy monster"" of the Victorian era; (b) Dickens' connecting prose passages are ""old fashioned"" and either too prosaic or sentimental; and (c) the characters (especially Florence) are too one-dimensional. For example: Florence is too sentimental, Dombey is too hard (initially) and Paul is far too intelligent and perceptive for his age.For those of us living in this modern world who desire an aquaintance with Victorian classics, give this a miss. If you must read Dickens (and he must continue to be read), read CHUZZELWITT or DORRIT instead. DOMBEY is just too long and too plot-fixated for any but those with an already acquired taste for Dickens.(Perhaps a Trollopian heroine might also be to your taste.)"
1,Bag of Wind,"This book was the most boring piece of crap I have ever read. Just because Dicken's wrote some good pieces does not mean all of his works belong in the Hall of Fame. This might have been better in serial form, but not in a full book. I can only recommend this book to insomniacs."
2,Why this is not a well known Dickens,"There's a reason why this book is not on the list of Dickens greats. It was published a year before David Copperfield, and perhaps Dickens was still learning how to get this right. It was his first popular serial novel, so his English readers liked it. However, it is incredibly repetitive and overwhelmingly sentimental. The main female character, Florence, is an unloved child who nevertheless unwaveringly, for 833 pages, seeks the love of her cold-hearted father. She is too good to be true, and that kills the story."
3,A GOOD SEAGAL MOVIE,"I FEEL I AM THE ONLY TRUE SEAGAL FAN LEFT I OWN ALL HIS MOVIES{NICO HARD TO KILL,MARKED FOR DEATH,OUT FOR JUSTICE,UNDER SIEGE,UNDER SIEGE 2,ON DEADLY GROUND,EXECUTIVE DECISSION,THE GLIMMERMAN,FIRE DOWN BELOW,THE PATRIOT,EXIT WOUNDS,TICKER,THE FOREIGNER,OUT FOR A KILL,HALF PAST DEAD,BELLY OF THE BEAST.AND I RESPECT ALL OF THEM AND HIM.THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE WITH FANTASTIC ACTION SCENES.THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE POOR THOUGH FOR EXAMPLETHE SKYTHE FIREAND I HATE THE SCENE IN THE BARBERS WHEN THAT MAN IS RUNNING UP THE WALLALL IN ALL A GOOD SEAGAL MOVIEYOU SHOULD ALSO STOP DISSING THE WAY HE LOOKS HE IS 55 FOR GODS SAKE"
2,I'm so glad,"That i didnt buy this DVD. I am a huge Steven Seagal fan, HUGE. But even with that being the case, i am stretching just to give this movie anything above 2 stars. I enjoyed the fighting (of course) its Segal and everything. But everything just seemed more than a bit off in the movie. Not sure how to explain it other than saying that this movie is one of my least fav Segal movie next to the Foreigner.Action was great, overall quality was sucky, story doesnt need one. It explains enough for you to get whats up. Something bad happens to him and he goes and takes out all that get in his way, nuff said.I watched this over my best friends place the other day and i'm happy that i didnt pay for this movie. Because i would be asking for a refund of my money/due to mental stress and anguish. Rent this one at your own risk...even diehard fans of Segal would pressed to enjoy this one.I sure didnt."
1,out for a paycheck,"looking fatter and slower than ever this is the worst(now that takes so doing)seagal movie yet! please stop making these awful movies mr. seagal and wait for a better script,or better yet just retire!!!!!!!!!!! skip it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
2,should have been better,"Out For A Kill is not as entertaining as I'd hoped it would be, but Seagal's Belly Of The Beast was released recently and it's great. Seagal still has it, but Out For A Kill isn't very coherent. Don't let this one deter you. Give Belly Of The Beast a try."
2,Fat Jacket Segal,"This movie is a ""Fat Jacket Movie""! If you are a Segal fan, you know what I mean. It is very easy to tell if a Segal flick is going to be good. Simply, look at the cover. If Steven is wearing a large jacket, in order to cover a large round ""santaesque"" belly, than just put it down and back away.Try to keep your Segal flicks pre-Fire Down Below. These are the true ultraviolent, bone popping, one-lining, former-agent-turned-whatever Flicks.I am a Segal fan...the Segal Fan, but one must recognize the boundries of Segal flick watching.By the by, if you find Fat Jacket Segal movies funny(like I do), this one has some deliciously absurd crap in it.P.S.If I were to meet Steven Segal I would tell him his movies are great. I think he could still break me into pieces."
1,What is this?,"I can't make any sense out of this film at all. The only highlight is a martial artist using monkey gung-fu. I'm a Seagal fan who is still waiting for him to make a come back. I admired & respected his environmental-awareness films (Fire Down Below, On Deadly Ground, The Patriot)."
1,"Damm, you all were right...!","Impressive... I saw all your comments on this site and i decided to rent the DVD.The film look like a cheap old time hong-kong movie, the combats are incredibly funny and Steven Seagal is so funny when he starts teaching us the philosophy of life. At the end, (i accelerated the middle of the movie) i was pleased to have seen such an impressive avatar of what never to do with an action movie.I have a small thing to ask : i like the music in the following scene 21. The Tattoo Parlor [5:11]Could someone tell me what is the band and song name? I think this is the only interesting thing in this movie lol"
1,Definately the dumbest movie i've ever seen,"For starter's i was a big Seagal fan in the late 80's early 90's..his movies were real,raw,and the fight scenes were classic.This has some of the cheesiest one liner's from the whole cast that i've probably EVER seen or heard,even Charles Bronson's Death Wish flicks were'nt this bad.Also the fight scenes are Speed up,slow down,speed up,slow down again,my god just fight.And i shouldnt neglect to mention the computer technology in the movie could have been done by my grandma who can't even run a computer.This is like a horrible matrix rip off with the horrible action motion,stops and starts.And its also plotless.Save yourself the pain and just go watch Finding Nemo.This goes in the movie waste ben."
2,Not what I expected!,"I have always been Steven Seagal fan, couldn't wait to see them all! But this movie had to be Steven at his worst. It jumped around from scene to scene, sometimes to leave you wondering what in the world was going on. It was hard to figure out exactly who was doing what. It couldn't hold our interest, and we found ourself dozing off. We actually stopped this movie before it was over. I won't be buying THIS movie to add to my Seagal collection!"
1,What a DISAPPOINTMENT !!!!,"I am a big Steven Seagal fan. I wish there was something good I could say about this movie. Unfortunately, I purchased it on DVD (which had no added extras, except trailers) and was really disappointed. I would recommend any of Mr.Seagal's other movies. But not this one. If you are thinking of purchasing it anyway, then please rent it first."
1,Wasted 60 minutes,"First, I've been a huge fan of Steven Seagal. But this movie sinks to a new low (it doesn't deserve any stars). Poor filming, poor dialogue, poor martial arts (almost no aikido). I kept watching, hoping it would get better, or at least the action would be interesting, but gave up after an hour. No redeeming value whatsoever, save your money and your time."
1,The Long Coat Doesn't Hide the Huge Seagal,"After buying 'The Foreigner' I had made up my mind to never buy another Steven Segal movie - then I weakened and bought 'Out For a Kill'. I should have followed my own advice. The long coat doesn't hide the garguantuan, old, made-up, lethargic Steven Seagal. The plot was so phoney and there must be something wrong with Seagal's voice because he sounded like a cartoon character. After two movies of long coats, the real-life, out-of-shape Steven Seagal shines forth. The obvious dyed hair (to hide the gray) didn't work. He needs to cut off the locks and create a new character - the martial arts moon has eclipsed. Maybe a hard-boiled city detective who shows the young s***s some tricks?"
4,Any film with Elaine Tan and Michelle Goh...,"Any film in which I get to ogle Elaine Tan and Michelle Goh for an hour plus is an automatic 4-stars! I would give it 5 stars, but they kill off Elaine Tan's character within the first few minutes of the film, which is a minus 1 star. Too bad she hasn't been in any other films in America. Michelle Goh you get to ogle for the duration of the film, so that's nice.Seagal killing the bad guys and studying their hand tattoos for his next clue is both silly and amusing at the same time. This is one of those films you just have to enjoy it for what it is - Saturday B movie with a beer in one hand and ready for a nap.FINAL GRADE: B+"
5,great read,"i can't wait for the next one.characters are complex to peak your intrest, fast paced. def. not ""fluff"" reading. would recommend it in a heart beat."
2,Started promising.,"This started out so promising, with a really great premise: a professional assassin has a potential client who has a strange request - the person she wants killed is herself. Add to that the fact that the assassin is also a werewolf, and you're ready for a rip-roarin' good time! Except that's not really what you get. The story is narrated by Tony, the assassin, and I just didn't like his tone. I found him to be flippant and overly emotional, when I really wanted him to be hard and cool. And if the werewolf stuff isn't enough for you, there's some extra weird metaphysical stuff at the end that really makes no sense at all. I generally enjoy paranormal/urban fantasies, but this was a little too much for me. I'm not interested in finishing this series."
5,Great Find,I won't rehash the story. It is a humerous read that held me til the end. If you like para normal you'll like this.
3,"An assassin, a werewolf and a millionaire","The first book in the Tales of the Sazi series by C.T. Adams and Cathy Clamp gets a mixed review. The book wasn't great by any stretch of the imagination but it also wasn't horrible. The book is definitely missing something and has too much going on in the plot but there are some redeeming chapters.Hunter's Moon introduces the reader to Tony, he was raised in the mob and trained to be an assassin and when on of his jobs goes wrong he gets turned into a werewolf.Sue is the lucky winner of lottery, she won millions of dollars and yet her life is miserable because of her family. She tries to hire Tony to kill her but instead they end up talking.Their two lives get intertwined and and some of Tony's enemies make Sue their target.ash"
2,weird,"Very uneven blend of not very good paranormal with lots of bad mafia gangster stuff and a weird romance between unlikeable characters. Also, I'm use to a woman not a man being the main character, in first person written romance/paranormal books, so that was weird too. Why anybody liked this book is a mystery to me."
1,2 books at twice the price and my identity stolen,"I was sent 2 copies of this book, had to return it and ask for a refund, then I was only given half the money back for a untouched book until I appealed. On top of that my amazon credit card which sits in my dresser draw and has not been used on anything except amazon purchases, let alone left the house was used to purchase a string of meals in Florida. I have never been to Florida. Sure I canceled the card etc, etc, but the security breach can have only have a occurred thru this website or chase. No I have also only used my home computer for purchases and no other cards have been used."
2,I wanted to like it... but I couldn't,This book was not really bad but it was not good. These characters for all they are supposed to be logical and efficient were just emotional basket cases. I couldn't empathize with them. Good luck finding good literature.
1,If you like whining females this is for you,"I bought this book on all the rave reviews, based on that I think my expectations were very high.This whining pathetic female was such a turn off. We all live in a real world of people like her, so of course I don't want to have to read about her, I like my females to be smart or at least courageous, but I hated this one from the start. I couldn't give this book away fast enough, I was scared it might contaminate my other books. I don't know why so many people gave it good reviews?????"
1,Incredibly Disappointing,"I had accidentally picked up ""Moon's Fury"" first--which is a wonderful, exciting, and well-written book.Having said that--this one was just BAD. I really, really wanted to like this book because of ""Moon's Fury,"" and I was really looking forward to having a new series to devour. But the characters were completely one dimensional and cliched. Tony is the ""hitman with a heart of gold"" who goes against everything that he believes in and holds as truth for a woman that he barely knows. Sue is weak, whiny, and can't do anything for herself. All the characters are black-and-white good-or-evil and there was absolutely no ambiguity in anyone's character.Really, the book is just filled to the brim with cliches that made me really, really sad. I recommend skipping right to ""Moon's Fury"" as the characters actually have substance and the plot is infinitely more interesting."
1,"Disappointing, hack, and a poor copy","I purchased this book due to the cover endorsement by Laurell K. Hamilton. I hate to admit it, but that was the best and most interesting part of this mess.A werewolf hitman falls in love with a lottery winner. Whoopdedoo. The writers attempt to create a 'Were' society that underlays ours at the same time juggling a very unpleasant hero who is apparently a mafia hitman. I am led to believe the authors were trying to create a male version of Anita Blake. Unfortunately, they miss that which makes Anita appealing, her humanity and struggle to be who she is.Laurell K Hamilton, Sherylin Kenyon and Charlaine Harris do a far better job with more likable characters, more believable plots, and less annoying heroines.I'm afraid I tossed the book with less than 10 pages to go because I simply could not care less what happened to ANYONE in this book."
4,Ya gotta like the werewolf,"I'm a sucker for werewolves. And Tony was a superbly written character. Sure, the lead female, Sue, who becomes his mate is kind of a whiner, but for some reason I think she is a redeemable whiner. I think that is what the wolf sees in her too. Plus, the whole concept of mating and bonding, while not novel, is strangely stirring in Hunter's Moon."
2,"Short, short lifespan","I own two Canon cameras that are compatible with this battery, and this Lenmar one has been the worst of all four that I've purchased.After the first 3 months, it wouldn't hold a charge nearly as long as the other 3 brands (including the original OEM battery). After 6 months, it lasts about 30 shots before the camera dies.It doesn't matter which camera I put it in; the poor performance is identical in both cameras. Look for a different replacement battery!"
4,might need a higher power battery,"I got a couple of these to supplement the one cannon battery that came with my TX1. It seems to me they are some what underpowered. I can use one in a day with out trying too hard. It might be that the video mode on the camera is a big drain on the battery.I'm comparing this battery to the ones I use on my EOS, which seem to last weeks between charges, but it might not be fair as it has no video mode..This battery is only 760mAh, I'd probably go for at least a 900 next time.."
2,Cheap but short-lived,"It was great for its price while it lasted. I had this battery for about 9 months (charged it a total of about 20 times since I switch between the stock canon battery and this one). During that time it worked great, but now it works for less than 30 minutes before the my Canon 850IS indicates that it's dying. I've had the stock Canon battery and it's still going strong."
3,It works,This battery works great in my canon powershot sd1100 is. It doesn't last as long as the stock battery though.
2,Defective exterior,Mine comes wrapped in black plastic as one of the pictures shows. The corner of this stuff is curling up making it difficult to insert battery in camera. I just sent a complaint about this to Lenmar.
1,Disappointed,I purchase two batteries. One for myself and one for the camera I purchased for my son. The battery got stuck in the new camera even though it is the battery suggested for this camera. I charged the other battery for my camera and got maybe five pictures before it died completely. I would never purchase any of these products again.
1,No Luck with this cheap replacement,"Received a battery that seamed to be shorted out and would not accept a charge. It caused the charger to blink alternate amber & green, which it never does with other batteries. After a few hours of this, there was still no charge at all. There must be poor quality control on these batteries, as another reviewer also noted a cell that would not take a charge.Take your chances with this one, I'd say it's a gamble."
1,Get what you pay for,This battery falls far short of being a direct replacement for the NB4L. I would say it holds only half the charge of the OEM battery. You get what you pay for.
1,Battery Stinks...Warranty Is Worse,"Like many others here, my battery died and wouldn't take a charge after less than one year's use. As there is a 3-year warranty, and I had my receipt, I didn't think it would be difficult to get a replacement.My initial request (per online form) to Lenmar was simply ignored. My second request got me a form letter saying that I should mail the dead battery to them, preferably insured, at my own cost - after which they'd send me a replacement battery for ""$7.50 shipping.""In other words, I'll pay as much in postage as I would to replace the battery. And, oh yeah, ""allow 4 weeks for your replacement to arrive.""I'll try some other brand of battery, thanks, and hope that this warning can steer others away from this questionable company."
4,works fine,You don't always have to buy the 'name' brand for your camera. I saved a lot of money by purchasing this one.
4,about what I expected,"I got an hour of video on the official battery with my 300 hs and half an hour with this battery. minus one star because it claims to have the same capacity as the official battery. half the cost of the official battery, half the price of the official battery.you get what you pay for."
1,Lousy,"Bought this for my Canon S95. It didn't fit the charger without forcing because it's too thick on one side, and wouldn't fit the camera either. Was afraid to force it harder into the camera than I did and risk wrecking the camera and the guarantee. Lousy product and a waste of money."
4,"Great to have a 2nd battery, but not as much run-time","This battery only lasts about 1/2 to 3/4 the standard stock battery that comes with the cannon. Of course it was less money, so I can't complain too much. Definitely worth having a backup, so you don't get stuck with one battery and not be able to take pics at that ""moment""."
4,NBL4 Backup battery,This battery is an excellent choice as a backup for a Canon made battery.Would purchase again.
3,Initial Impressions,"I purchased two of these on the basis of favorable comments. I have only tried one of them so far, and only one charge cycle.I charged one fully with the Canon charger and used it in my SD450. It's life seemed much shorter than my 2-year old Eveready battery and the Canon battery. I don't know if this is just this sample, will have to use it more and also the other sample, to see.If I recall, the instruction does say the battery should be charged and drained fully to get maximum capacity. I'll have to test to see if that's true here, but usually Li-Ion batteries like these do not benefit from such charge/discharge cycles."
3,Works with a few glitches,"I bought this in 2007 with a Canon SD1000. It charges fine with the Canon charger. After about 5 minutes of use the low-battery light starts flashing on the camera, but if you ignore the warning, it works for much longer. Eventually the camera will shut off stating ""Change Battery Pack"", if you remove and re-insert the battery it works for a few more shots or a few more minutes of video. The original Canon battery works fine without any of these glitches. So I'm assuming that the problem is with the Lenmar battery. It cost me about 25% of what the Canon battery would have cost and therefore give 3-stars for still being able to use it even with a few glitches."
5,Great value,A great replacement battery for my SD1000. Saved a lot of money too. Fast shipping by this company. Not disappointed at all.
2,"Yes it's cheap, but really low capacity","I bought this as a backup to the Canon battery. After having used both for a week, I estimate that this one has about 1/4 the capacity of the Canon. Yes the price is good but it sure runs out of juice fast. I think I'll spring for another Canon Battery."
2,Worthless Warranty,"Bought this battery because of the 3 year warranty. However, if you claim after 90 days they make you pay $7.50 shipping so you know you're paying for the replacement so there's really no difference between the quality of this battery and the cheapies out there."
1,Not worth the price.,"I bought a Lenmar DLC4L batter to use as a backup for my Canon camera. I used it occasionally, and the last time I tried to use it, it would not power the camera, but the charger indicated it is fully charged. I thought that one battery was much like another with the same chemistry. Not true. The Canon battery works well, and continues to work well for me. The Lenmar battery worked for a short time, but now does not work. I won't buy another Lenmar battery if I can help it."
1,Don't buy it!! Spend the money on the real one.,"I wish there was this source of reviews when I bought mine, 33+ other people had the same problem - the Lenmar DLC4L does not hold a charge at all and is completely unusable. The seller at the time was the battery center, who conveniently doesn't answer email now. Unfortunately for me, Amazon is unwillingly the solve this problem since it is more than 90 days since the day of purchase (battery worked for a short period of time). What poor service. What a waste of money, especially the shipping."
1,this battery is garbage,"i bought this battery as a cheap backup battery for my canon sd600. this battery worked great for the first six months. but after that, this battery was only able to hold about a half-day's worth of juice on a full charge. i know that rechargeable batteries tend to degrade over time, but c'mon... that's ridiculous. in comparison, the canon battery that originally came with my camera still works nearly as good as new."
1,Low Capacity,"The battery I purchased does not hold very much charge. It lasts about 25% of the time for the ""Canon"" brand battery. It could be that I got unlucky, but I suspect that it just is a cheaply made battery with bad manufacturing tolerances.ps: I do analysis of energy efficiency for consumer goods for a living, and have thought a lot about batteries."
2,Battery Life,I bought this battery the same time as the camera as a backup battery. This battery lasted only 6 months then died. It will no longer accept a charge. The original Canon battery still works fine.
4,Overall good buy,"I purchased this battery as a backup for the one that came with the camera. For the cost it has been a great purchase. It does not seem to last as long as the standard battery (just over half as long from what I have seen), but for the much lower cost I would definitely recommend it."
5,good replacement value,"These batteries don't last quite as long as the original batteries, but are pretty darn close. I bought a couple to take with me on a cruise and got a couple hundred pictures on one battery. All outside without the flash. Haven't ran down the second battery yet."
1,Total dud!,"The battery I received proved totally worthless, not good for more than ten minutes of use. Never improved with successive attempts to recharge. Beware and steer clear, or trust your good luck and gamble figuring you won't lose much if yours is the same."
3,supposedly a Lenmar battery,"I ordered a Lenmar DLC4L Lithium-ion battery for my Canon powershot digital camera. The battery I received is not labeled a Lenmar as in the photo, but it seems to work OK so far."
3,"expected lenmar brand as pictured, received no-name battery","ordered based on title of product as well as item pictured, however received no-name battery. seems to work OK, so am not too upset."
1,Received a generic one instead of Lenmar,"Saw similar comments w.r.t the same issue. Now I am wondering if it was a mistake by ""the battery center"" or it was intentional. Although the generic one claims to have more capacity (1200mah vs 760mah), I am afraid of using it in my camera."
1,Wrong battery from The Battery Center,The Battery Center sent me the wrong battery. I paid for the Lenmar battery but got a cheap knock off. It was a Christmas gift for my father but he won't use it because he thinks it may be the brand that Canon is warning their customer may blow up within the camera. It's been over a month but I'm going to see if I can still get a refund.
2,Would Not Buy Again,"I purchased two because they were inexpensive and got fairly good reviews. However, I began having problems with them as soon as I got them. I charged fully in my Canon battery charger, and as soon as I inserted the first one in the camera, I began getting the message ""Change Battery Pack"". I can get rid of the error by removing and reinserting the battery, but that is not acceptable. Then one battery soon refused to take a charge. It believes it is charged after about 10 minutes in the charger. The company did quickly replace the battery, so that was nice.I'm also concerned that the batteries I received do not look like the one pictured. They do not have the LENMAR name on them anywhere."
3,is this a lenmar battery?,"I thought that I purchased a Lenmar battery, but there are no manufacturer's identifying info on the case that appears to be a generic of a generic battery. I have yet to try it, so I have no idea whether it will be short-lived, great value, or not at all useful. Not as represented, but it could be fine or not."
5,Just as good as the Canon battery,I bought this as a spare and it lasts as long as the one that came with the camera (canon sd630). The price was good and now I never have to worry about running out of battery life.
1,Defective,"Just beware. The battery looks good, fits my Canon 1100 camera just fine. However, it would not charge in the Canon battery charger. The orange charge light on the charger would go on then go off right away. I wrote the company and they quickly responded. They said the battery should be completely compatible with Canon charger, and if it didn't work battery must be defective. I was impressed by company's response, but returned it and bought a different brand. How often are these defective? Your guess is as good as mine. At least Amazon will take it back if it is defective."
1,Bait and Switch Battery Offer,"Length:: 1:06 MinsI ordered this Lemnar battery for a back up for my new Canon camera, battery and charger. You will see here that this is a ""Bait and Switch"" offer, it is NOT the Lemnar DLC4L that was sent, but a generic, no name/ID battery which box states: For NB-4L.Update: This ""Lemnar brand that is actually generic"" battery was purchased from The Battery Center through Amazon, which is noticeably missing from their list of sellers now, 1 day after submitting this footage. The current sellers demand more than $7.00 a battery now, almost 4X price we all paid The Battery Center, not including shipping. Hmm...I wonder if their batteries are generic too..."
1,Not worth it!,"The battery was great ... for about a year. But now, the battery lasts about as long as the time to take one picture. I bought it as a backup, but now it's useless. If I buy another backup battery, it will be the canon battery. The battery that came with my canon camera still lasts as long as the day I bought it two years ago!"
1,You get what you pay for.,"I thought I'd give this a try, knowing that for the price, it wasn't going to be a great battery. I was just looking for a backup of the original Canon battery. As it turns out, it isn't much of a backup at all since it doesn't hold a charge very long. I've fully charged it several times and within a month (not installed in the camera), it's completely dead. I guess it's time to bite the bullet and get the Canon battery. You get what you pay for."
2,Will stick with name brands next time..,"After initially charging the Lenmar battery, I set it aside and initially charged the new Canon battery that I purchased at the same time. I installed the Lenmar into the camera a couple days later and it was completely discharged. I had to go out and buy a new Canon battery at retail as we were leaving shortly on a trip and I had no time to order one from Amazon."
4,good value,the battery definitely doesn't last as long as canon's but good enough as a backup battery.
4,"So Far, So Good.","Just bought this product earlier this month. I cannot speak for the longevity of the battery, but so far it holds a charge as long as the official Canon battery. We shall see what happens."
5,Works just like the Canon Battery,Works great. Can't tell any difference between this and the battery from Canon.Don't have any side-by-side comparison as far as number of shots or anything. I certainly haven't noticed a decrease.
5,as good as the original Canon battery,"$10 for this Canon equivalent NB-4L is a tremendous value, given that LENMAR stands behind their product with a 2 year warranty. I would buy this battery again. There are cheaper batteries but you are out of luck if you have problems with them."
5,Great performance,"I bought this battery for back-up. I cant tell it apart from the original in performance. Its really great, for less than half of the canon battery."
1,Lenmar DLC4L Lithium-ion Digital Camera/Camcorder Battery,"I wanted to replace my several-year old Canon battery that is having a short life. Upon receiving the Lenmar battery I charged it completely and alas, it only lasted 20 pictures in my camera. I discharged it completely and did a complete charge again. It still dies quickly, even worse than my old OEM Canon battery.I understand that I may have just gotten a bad battery and I will order another one. If it works as well as OEM Canon batteries, then I'll write another review with 4 or 5 stars to balance out my 1-star review here."
5,good battery so far,"So far so good. Much cheaper than canon OEM,holds charge just as well as original. Don't know about longevity, have only used it for a month."
2,not H.B.W.'s usual inspiring work,Seems silly for Harol Bell Wright's work. Did not enjoy it at all. Tried but could not get very far in it. Glad I got it on my kindle and didn't pay for it.
2,FAKE???,I'm sure this is a fake. This there isn't a New Era logo stitched on the hat...And the quality is poorly stitched in comparison to my other New Era hats... the hat has no form and the bill is shorter than normal...pretty disappointed that Amazon would have this on their shelf.
1,braves cap,i told amazon.com that i will never order from them again because i think it's incredibly cheap of them to only use USPS when super saver shipping has been qualified for. especially considering the amount of money i have spent with them over the years. i hope you do the same
5,Read this one if you can find it,"This book blew my mind and left me speechless.I am a huge Simak fan, and I snap up whatever is by him that I can find. I bought the only copy of this book that I have ever even seen.This is an absorbing, evocative, and thought-provoking book, that, as is the status quo for Simak, full of extremely interesting characters. Also, it is short. Short + good = very good.Have fun coming to terms with an extremely unsympathetic protagonist."
5,"""Destiny Doll"" is a late classic by a grand master","""Destiny Doll"" is a late classic by a grand master of sci-fi, Clifford Simak. Critical opinion is that his best work was done in the late fifties and early sixties but I find ""Destiny Doll"" (1972), a flawless mood piece. This is the work of a master who uses all that he knows about writing a story to create a work of art that is perfect from all aristotelian perspectives.I call this novel a mood piece for it is not a tragedy or a comedy but it is a homeric journey to the centre of humanity's soul. The unity of tone and metaphor are impeccable as is the character development, rise and fall of action, climax and denoument. Not a word seems out of place in the 180 pages. I am amazed at how beautiful and moving this novel is."
4,Mexican Soda is Good,"It contains cane sugar, not high fructose corn syrup, which is why I buy it. The flavors are different, like Tamarindo, Sangria, Mango then the usual like grapefuit, strawberry, etc. I get it for $1.29/ 2 liter bottle at the local Mexican food store."
2,Bad Marzipan,This marzipan was harder than I expected. It seem as if it was old-sitting around for a long time before it was shipped to me
4,"For the first time MBM listener, i suggest A S & V first...","I bought this album shortly after i purchase ""Actual Sounds & Voices"" and i must say that i was somewhat disappointed...at first. This is a very complex CD, at first you may not like it, but if you listen carefully you will have a lot of fun with this one. The fisrt CD is has grim feel to many of the tracks and maintains a pop music sound that is munmial enough noit to irritate the hardcore electronic music fan. Disc 2 is an odd assemblage of ambient music that intertwines with sinister sampling creating an addictive combination. This will become one of your favorite CD's."
4,"good, but not the best meat beat...","as a long-time fan of meat beat, i have to say that this is a good release, but it is NOT the best meat beat. it is not even representative. i was completely intrigued when i first listened to the whole thing, and still listen to it semi-regularly, but after many years of ""storm the studio"", i can still pop that album in and get chills.as a follower of ""electronic"" music in general, i can say that it is not the greatest technical or creative achievement either. i can even refer to the ruthless, mesmerizing and poetic crunching of some of jack's older work in comparison....and i'm a dub fan, so it's not the repetition. =)"
5,"If you buy one ""electronic"" album here it is...","The Opus Magnum, the Everestial summit, that is MBM's Subliminal Sandwhich. This (double)CD is worth buying at ANY price. It is the synaesthetic mind-body-soul experience that music can and should be, listen, after listen, after listen... Layers, depth, lyrics, groove, production, mental bliss-its all there. This is the one MBM CD you have to have. BUY IT AND YOU WILL NEVER REGRET/FORGET IT."
5,Lasts longer than Energizer,"This 2-disk cd from MBM is a really well constructed mix of music. The songs are generally easy to listen and groove to, keeping up the tradition of hypnotic subtlties in the tracks. The second disk was more my style than the first, a little harder and more driving. A few of the songs are unfortunately long, you may have to fight the urge to skip through them when some samples loop on for minutes. When put together in conjunction however(especially on random), they create a much fuller experience."
1,Don't waste your time,"Not only is it not good design, the code itself doesn't even come close to running."
4,Exactly what I want.,"I just browsed the book in a bookstore in California, and decided to order it from Amazon. However, I am very confused over the negative ratings here. I guess, we are all looking for different things, at different levels. I want to model physical objects, like cars, and show how they move in a 3D-world. My idea is that the best way to get a better understanding of cars and the laws of physics in 3 dimensions, is to develop a program for it! I think this is more fun than any other kind of programming. This book will suit me well. Perfect for my level."
1,Total Disappointment,"I received this book 3 days ago after anticipating its arrival for 3 months. I have 4 other book from Apress about .NET programming and have been very happy so far, so I figured this book would be a winner too. That was the wrong assumption. I downloaded the code (the original and the patch). After patching together peices from both downloads I finally got it to compile, but the car doesn't even move (not a very fun driving game). The author seemed to write the book assuming you knew exactly what he was thinking when he wrote the program. He also doens't give a very clear description of his (some what cryptic) code. I'm getting ready to send this book back ASAP."
5,"Finally, pants demystified","This is one of the best books I have read on construction details. I have read it front to back and refer to it often when making pants, shorts, even skirts. I really recommend making a muslin first and follow all the recommendation for adjusting the pattern from the muslin. It will change the way you make pants forever!"
4,Pants for Real People,"This is a great time-saver for busy sewing enthusiasts. The book doesn't help you MAKE patterns for pants, on the assumption that since pants patterns are so cheap nowadays, it would be far easier to modify the patterns that you're using.The book has tons of very clear pictures of real live women with different body shapes, and the way the pattern-adjustment process is illustrated to adapt to their bodies is very informative on how to make the process of making your own custom-fit pants easier."
5,Treason,"What a great book...a real understanding of the age, but not too historically dry or stiff and with real compassion. Hats off to you Meredith Whitford"
4,Treason,"Witty & literate. If you are curious about Richard 111, War of the Roses/Tudors, this is an easy fictional approach -which may indeed reflect the truth.."
3,Nicely done,"Not the best, but lovingly and carefully done. I very much enjoyed it and agree Richard III deserves more than a reburial in anywhere other than Westminster."
3,Somewhat dissapointed,"Maybe I was expecting too much, but I was expecting this CD to take me right back to the MGM grand in the third row. It did not. This CD gets off on the wrong foot. The track Harem is horribly cut up to make it sound like some sort of interlude. I also have to wonder why tracks like the Phontom of the Opera suite are on here at all, while so many other songs would have made better choices. I would recomend only buying the DVD which will contain the full version off all songs.Stand out tracks for me are..Kama SutraNussun DormaSnow on the Sahara(Not a song from the show but a bonus track)"
4,Excellent except for the missing tracks,"I have seen Sarah in concert several times and thoroughly enjoyed Harem; however, I am disappointed with the CD only because it excludes the title track. Fans of Sarah often have to wait long periods for any new material and we eagerly anticipate new offerings. Ultimately, this CD is a must have for true fans who are rarely disappointed by Ms. Brightman. As for the comparison to Madonna and Cher, Sarah outsings and outperforms anyone."
3,I'm severely disappointed,"Granted the album does sound great, incredible even...but they left out the best songs! They couldn't even include the full version of ""Harem""?!? You know, the song the tour/CD is named after!!! They also omitted the fabulous ""What A Wonderful World"" and the ""Phantom"" piece could have been better if she actually sang the male parts. In all, I am a upset. First at Sarah for charging over $250 to see her live (girlfriend please...you ain't no Cher or Madonna) and the album for its lacking quality."
2,Somewhat Of A Ripoff Folks!,"The sound is great but it is editted material! Why not make a great two CD version of it instead of the concert edit? Anyway, for my money i'll just rip a soundtrack off the DVD & make my own double or triple CD set version. Buy the DVD & avoid the CD version of this release"
2,Very disappointed,Just got the CD today and was very disappointed. I saw Sarah in concert the day after this Vegas performance. Was very excited to get a copy of this CD but now see that several songs were left out. I agree with other reviewers ... this should have been a double CD if they could not get the whole concert on one CD. I can only hope the DVD will have the complete concert on it and I will make my own CD.
1,"doesn't play due to its ""Copy Control Protection""","I have a $700 panasonic DVD/VCD/Cd player, model DVD-RV31, the DVD player about 2 yr. old. I can play all 1000+ Cd I own, including 7 Sarah Brightman Cd.It doesn't play this CD due to its ""Copy Control protection"" scheme. Good thing I can refund this item. But on the sticker, it says only ""Car cd players"" may encounter playback problem. I have a home DVD/Cd player.Wouldn't be buying her next Cd, that's for sure, it's pointless to buy a CD if you can't play it."
4,Different,"This group is definately going to make it big, this album is the best yet. I went to Mexico City this summer and heard this really cool song, ""Antro"", I had no idea who sang the song, then I heard it was this gruop called Kabah. When I came home I started doing research, I was going to find who they were, through amazon.com I found them and imediately bought the CD. It's been over three months now and I never get tired of listening to it. I love this CD. It's great, a great relieve from all this BSB and Christina Aguilera stuff. The group has the coolest style, not only in the way they sing, but also in the way they dress! My personal favorites are ""Antro"",""Silencio y sola"" and ""Historia de una Noche"". I definately recomend this CD, and by the way I want to thank Alfa radio for playing this song while I was in Mexico!"
4,This is old school,"With old school fragrances, you want more.Especially when they are hard to find. Theonly problem Is, the size is much much muchto small. The 1.7 oz, would be a better buy.No problems with the seller. Price ??"
1,I'm glad the author's not my university professor,"The dust jacket states that the author teaches at the ""university level"". If so, he should know that in 146 B.C. Rome was still a republic, not an empire. I stopped reading at page 36 where he stated that Rome was an empire at that time. As the Romans might have said: ""falsus in unius, falsus in omnibus."""
4,When Nations Die,"It's amazing that this book was written more than a decade ago, yet the authors insights are dead on with what's happening in our country today. My only suggestion would be to encourage the author to bring his insights up to date with what's happened in the USA since he first wrote this book. I suspect he'd conclude that the situation has only gotten worse."
3,"I agreed with ""When Nations Die"" but...","...it was a disappointment. I remember seeing the author and his book on the 700 Club in the 1990's. I said ""I want to read that book"". Over time I had forgotten the title & author. It too me years to find the book. I finally did find it a month ago. I thought it was going to detail how nations of the past collapsed. It did...about 20% of it. The rest was on present day (at that time) mistakes within our own society. Therefore, it was not as good a book as I once thought."
3,Not bad but far from their earlier works,"This album contains few good songs, but we are far from the quality of earlier cd like ""Look at yourself"", ""The Magician's Birthday"" or ""Demons and Wizards"". The title track ""Return to Fantasy"", ""Prima Donna"" is a catchy song and I also like the ballad ""Why did you go"". The rest of the album is not very strong in my opinion."
4,Back to the basics.,"Uriah Heep ""Return To Fantasy"" #85 (1975).Back to the basics here, this their 8th studio album with new bass player John Wetton. The album begins with the classic Uriah Heep sound, ""Return To Fantasy"". The horn driven ""Prima Donna"". Other numbers include ""Beautiful Dream"", Your Turn To Remember"" and ""Shady Lady"". Most everything looked good for a return to classic Heep on their next album, ""High And Mighty"" (1976), but it wasn't to be."
5,After 2 years U still can't stop listening to the music,I love this CD. Ever since I heared the song NO Diggity I new I had to buy that CD and I did. I bought the CD in 1996 and it is almost 1999 and I still listen to it. This is one of the only CD's I've had where I actualy almost like every single song on the CD.Everyone who doesn't have this CD better get it because it is really worth it. I love and I hope U do too.
5,The Best Of Blackstreet !!,Just Listen This Album.!!~You Will be satisfied with this....If you like R&B category of music. ^^Trust Me...
4,I'm done with that homey,"This is a good album and is worth purchasing. The only song on this cd that should be skipped is a Blacksteet interview (14). Everyone has heard ""no diggity"" and knows that's a good song. The other songs that are good to listen to can't be listed here because there are so many of them."
5,ONE OF THE BEST R&B GROUPS AND CD OF 21ST CENTURY!! THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE CD's ITS TIMELESS!,VOCALLY NOT MANY GROUPS TODAY CAN TOUCH THE VOCAL STYLINGS OF BLACKSTREET! THEY WERE ONE OF THE BEST R&B GROUPS TO DATE...THIS CD SHOULD'VE GOTTEN WAAAAAY MORE CREDIT AND ACCOLADES THAN IT DID.
5,lovin soft and beautiful songs i have ever heard,i have always listen and bought all the cds they have made there music has a way getting out to the ladies and it alwasy seems to make me feel good when i havin trouble have all the cds because the are very special to me i love good work yall have being doing and i would like for yall yo keep doing what cha do and god bless
4,Nice job,It's hard to make a good album when the original members are not there anymore. But Blackstreet managed to do it!!! Although some of the interludes were unnecessary it was a good album.
3,You can only listen to so much of BLACKstreet,"Especially on this album. I bought it for ""No Diggity"" and then sat through the whole lenghty album and lost my appetite. Every member has great voices (especially Mark Middleton, but Teddy ""Street"" Riley tried to make it all about Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal), but what is it about this album that made it irritating? Maybe it was the overuse of Teddy's talkbox/vocoder à la Roger Troutman. Or maybe it was the fact that almost every song ""contains a sample from"" such-and-such (""No Diggity"" is sampled from Bill Withers' ""Grandma's Hand"" and Debarge is sampled at least twice on this album). There's nothing wrong with that, but when you do it too much, you don't look too original in the public's eye. Still, my favorite song from this album is ""Good Lovin'"" (which is sampled from The Staple Singers' ""Let's Do it Again""). I haven't listened to this album in six years and I think I'll keep it that way."
4,Great for Used,I would have given it 5 starts if i didn't have a couple skips on the CD. It was well worth the price though and the skips although noticable are not within a major song that i like most.
3,MICROPHONE PROBLEMS,"AS ONE OF THE EARLIER REVIEWS MENTIONED, THE SET I RECEIVED ONLY CAME WITH ONE MICROPHONE. IN ADDITION, AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS OF USE, THE MICROPHONE KEPT CUTTING OUT. MY CURRENT EXPERIENCE WITH LOGITECH AND TARGET.COM TO REPLACE MY MIKE HAS BEEN LESS THAN SUCCESSFUL. I HAVE HEARD OTHERS HAVE HAD SIMILIAR MICROPHONE EXPERIENCES."
4,Works well!,"This is great to cover my large wooden cutting board, I can easily put in dishwasher and don't have to deal with cleaning my large cutting board...wish it could have been a tad large, but all in all I like it!"
5,I love this,"Finally a cutting board that doesn't warp, crack or hold onto whatever it's used for, meaning no residual bad stuff from cutting. I use this every day and it's pretty enough to leave out on the counter."
5,next best thing to homemade,Imagine Chicken broth is as close to homemade stock as I can find. Cooks Illustrated rates it very high also. My only complaint is I am unable to get it in a larger size. A 1 Qt. box would be nice.Having family members with MSG allergies is what prompted me to start making my own stock. Slowly I started finding stocks/broths with no MSG added but the taste was not always true. I re-order this often so I can always have it on hand in my pantry.
3,Disappointed,I was disappointed with this product. The woman speaker does a great job but the male speaks way too quickly for a beginner and even too quickly for someone refreshing their german. Don't bother with this product. The good thing about this is that it also comes with a book and that is very helpful.
3,satisfied,sasisfied but didnt' realize it wasn't avle to be used on a ocmputer..I'm in Germany and am needing to learn language quick;y
5,Perfect for beginners!,"The CD set is perfect for those that are just starting to learn the German language. It starts out with the essentials with each following lesson building on the one before. The speakers are clear so that you can learn the correct pronounciation of the words. They also go through formal German conversation with informal conversation following. Overall, I recommend this CD to anyone who is interested in learning German."
3,Just OK,"I was disappointed by this CD set. For the most part there is no apparent method to the madness. You are given a random english word or phrase and the german translation. Most of the time with no <pause> to give you time to repeat the phrase in german. Some sections have a little order. It takes you through days of the week, counting, months. And all of the information was accurate. But overall it seems like I was listening to an audio english to german dictionary. I would recommend checking out Pimsleur's language program. It is a much better program...though much more expensive. Cheers."
4,Perfect for advanced beginners,"For those new to learning German, this program may move too fast to fully understand the content (especially CD 2 onwards), however it would be recommended to sit down with the handbook and move through the exercises in accordance with the CD to gain a fuller understanding. The content is great and covers various important areas of the German language (especially situations that may arise when travelling in a German speaking country). Therefore great as a 'do-at-home' resource but too intense for the car."
4,So Far I'm Impressed,"My German is very rusty. I'm not a beginner but chose to start at disc 1. The pace is good, the lessons varied and its not too tedious. Grammar is covered but in such a way that its not overbearing. I wish there were a few more drills at each section but I realize they can't do everything. I've only finished 2 discs and for me while there is much that is already familiar, there is still enough new to keep me interested.Be careful and check your package. My original set came with 6 CDs but I had discs 1-3 twice (4-6 were missing). This was replaced no problem, but I'm glad I discovered it up front, not when I needed disk 4!"
3,Works but can't be the only material,"The ""listen & repeat"" thing does work & I learn a lot after listening to each lesson a couple of times. But I'm not always sure what I heard is what is being pronounced, & the CDs don't provide guidance for pronunciation past the introduction on alphabet. Moreover, when it comes to grammar, it'll be a lot better to have a book. The little book that comes w/ the CDs does not have everything talked about on the CDs; it only has the dialog & the vocalbulary for each lesson."
3,Still trying to figure out if I like it.,"Training for Utopia, Plastic Soul Impalement (Tooth and Nail, 1998)I'm still not quite sure what to think of Training for Utopia. They've obviously got a handle on what they're doing, and know how to keep the listener's attention; it's not often that a thrash./hardcore band knows how to use noise to get their point across (and when you're in the same company as Integrity and Neurosis, you're certainly doing something right). On the other hand, vocalist Ryan Clark doesn't even attempt dynamics. The lyrics are all delivered in the same raspy full-on attack, which tends to lend a monotony to the parts of the songs that do have vocal accompaniment.A fully instrumental album by TfU would have been, I think, an awe-inspiring thing. But since the band have broken up, this will have to do. ***"
4,psychotic,"This record is insane, excellent, desperate sounding vocals, very dirty, thrashy guitars, meaty bass, and pulsing, relentless drums. the vocals are dark and emotional, my only comlaint is that the drums are horribly mixed. the best track is: ""single handed attempt at revolution"""
2,Boring,"I finally gave up and quit reading. It didn't make much sense. I love paranormal, metaphysical mysteries, but this never managed to take off. A good premise wasted. Book could really have used a good editor, too."
1,begin unravel after 1st trip,"I bought this product for a trip to South America; it's light in terms of weight, has a bunch of external pockets and great internal space; however after my first trip start to begin unravel, so I lost the confidence on the product"
2,Ok But...,"Perfect size, light and practical design. Sadly poor construction. Shoulder strap unstitched on 2nd trip. Carry handle disappeared courtesy of a British Airways flight. Shame the materials were 2nd rate as this is the best bag....as long as you don;t plan on taking it away from home ;-("
5,Mossad Tactical Duffle Bag - Black,"BS""DWe bought this bag for our son to go to overnight camp with. It is very well made, and was able to hold a sleeping bag, blankets, two sets of sheets, several towels, and more..."
4,"I HAVE CAUGHT ON, AND I LOVE IT","Brenda is one of the best, and this recording proves it. The recording ""Catch On"" means a great deal to the current state of affairs!! Many thanks to Brenda."
5,Paris Rain,"This is one of the most amazing albums i have ever heard! (im only 17!) After hearing piano in the dark on manchesters 104.9 imagine fm, i just knew that i had to have brenda russells greatest hits, and now i have extended to paris rain.My fave song is cant hide your heart from me and it its absolutely beautiful, as are many of the other tracks. The lyrics she writes are beautiful and from the heart and her voice is amazing, and that is what makes a good songwriter and performer, not .like most of the stuff in the charts.Most people in england have never heard of brenda russell, and she is too good a secret to be kept!"
5,The Best,"A long time Brenda fan, I awaited this release with great expectations. Not only did Brenda not disappoint, she exceeded my expectations. Brenda's trademark lyrics of love, hope, and all things good are beautifully conveyed in her performances and the incredible musicians backing her up. If there is any fairness in the world, Brenda will win a grammy or two for this work. In the meantime, I will continue to play the CD 3 or 4 times a day in my car, on my 3 CD players, etc."
5,Big Brenda Russell Fan,"I don't know why I'm just purchasing this, but I'm really happy I did. It's packed with wonderful songs that only Brenda Russell could write and/or perform. I'm a huge Brenda Russell fan, and I own most of her recordings, including her most recent single (""Open Heart, Open Mind""), and she still sounds really great on it. I can only hope she continues to record for many more years to come."
1,Cheap plastic holding the cartridges,"I was very excited when I got this as I had been using the case that the mounted shells come in to carry around 4 carts, not the handiest solution. This case was supposed to make my life a little bit easier during breakdown and travel. Anyhow the plastic that the case is made of is hard as a rock, its definitely built tough on the outside. However, the plastic that holds the cartridges in place gets loose and one actually snapped at the top. I only had it for about 6 months before I started finding delicate and expensive cartridges shaking around the case. Something better than this is needed but not sure what would work. And I was using standard technics head shells that come pre-mounted with Shure M44-7 cartridges, so no way that it was a size issue.Do not buy."
3,Not the same as the picture?,"It arrived new in a box, but does not match the picture. I was hopeing to get the one in the picture, but I got the older version I guess."
1,Horrible!,"Does not look anything like the picture. Poorly made, tarnishes horribly and was a very strange color when it arrived - and even stranger now! Avoid this ring!"
3,THE MONGOOSE OR THE COBRA?,"This movie was originally released in 1972 under the title, ""SACRIFICE."" Ivan Rassimov plays a Swedish John Bradly (Sven) who gores to Thailand as a photographer along with his blond gf. (Like bringing sand to the beach.) They attend a kick-box tournament with the Thai crowd going wide as if it was the WWF. She gets bored and leaves. He gets drunk and in a bar fight, kills a man, then flees to the jungles between Burma and Thailand were he is captured by a sadistic tribe, who eventually make him one of them. The acting was fairly decent. The plot was one we have seen many times. There is a lot of animal violence in addition to people violence. While this film is recognized as the first cannibal horror film, it lacks much of the ""horror"" cannibalism and gore of later films.sex, rape, full frontal Thai nudity, cannibalism, blood"
1,Appalling Writing Style,I have just started to read these books to my 2 year old son and I am amazed at how badly written they are. The sentence construction is awkward and the grammar is appalling.
5,A nice set,This is a nice set of books- the quality is good and the size is nice. The illustrations (black & white) are lovely. Perfect for a child's library.
5,a MUST have,"I have wanted this book collection for years.I am a huge Winnie the Pooh fanatic. I love Classic Pooh, Disney Classic Pooh, and the Disney Pooh Bear. I knew long before finding the book collection on Amazon, that the E.H. Shepard original drawings where in black & white. This is the way A.A. Milne presented Winnie the Pooh to Christopher Robin.I also plan on getting the the larger book that has colored the drawings. But, that's just to add to the collection.This is a must have for any Winnie the Pooh fan, whatever design you prefer. This is where it all started. I could not be more thrilled to own them!"
5,Childhood,My 15 year old daughter requested these books. She finds them soothing to read and likes everything about them.
2,this edition is in black and white,"This edition is in black and white, I would not have ordered if I had known. I ordered this edition because I thought the 4 small books would be easier for a child to hold and read than the larger, heavier editions (of which I actually own). I didn't order the 80th anniversary edition because I read several reviews that said the covers tear easily on that edition. However, the color editions are so much more beautiful and have much nicer paper than this edition.Please note I rate this edition as a 2, but the books themselves as a 5. Winnie-the-Pooh is every child's favorite."
4,This is a good selection for bedtime stories.,I have read this entire collection. It's really fascinating. Although I found it was a little hard for young children to stay focussed through out the whole story. It would be best for kids ages 5 and up.
5,Beautiful!,Nothing better than sharing the classics with your children! It's all you'd expect for a great price. Buy it! You won't be sorry
4,My daughter loves it!,"I was out shopping with my daughter and showed her a variety of toys. This was the one that she instantly went for, so we bought it. That was almost 2 months ago, and it's still one of her favorites. She loves to hear it rattle, and she loves chewing on its tail. She is fascinated by the lion's big, bright smiling face. She'll hold it out in front of her in both hands and ""talk"" to it.This may not be the most exciting toy--no bells and whistles--but it's cute, bright, and cuddly, and my daughter obviously adores it, so I would definitely recommend it."
4,Cute and Cuddly first doll,This doll is so cute and soft. She is the perfect size. She is lightweight and plushy with a sweet scented face. My daughter sleeps with her and points out her facial features. The finger does not actually fit in the mouth.
5,SOOOOO GOOOOD!!!,Season1 was soo good that I could hardly believe it I watch the whole thing at my friends house and could hardly wait for season 2!! What was really annoying however was that Lana and Clark weren't Getting together though there was chemestry and lots of it! I started watching season 3 and was totally on the edge of my seat and even found myself screaming with fright at some points! What totally made me feel better was that Tom Welling was in the picture most of the time! I really recommend this series but for Older kids because of violence and sometimes innapropriate scenes and Language!
4,Tyco Shell Shocker Is The Most Unique RC Toy of 2005!,"As I mentioned in a previous article, the Shell Shocker is the coolest land-based RC toy I've played with since, well ever. I purchased this review unit myself, and once I got it home realized I misread the packaging - to me it seemed that you could purchase an extra battery pack if you wanted to, but it was not 100% crystal clear that I needed to buy one of these separately. Some people are going to be turned off when they realize that they need to purchase a $30 battery for a toy they already spent $60 for - trust me when I realized I had to go back to the store I was right there with ya. Once you get the battery charged and start playing though, all that frustration will disappear."
4,Kids like it.,I think this is a fairly strange toy. It is hard to control but that makes it interesting for the kids. W have a 7 and 5 year old and they think it is very cool. I have to admit that over time though - like most toys - the newness of the toy goes away and they haven't played with it much since the holidays. Still it is fun even though it is hard to control. We had to return the first one because one of the functions failed - (moving the legs in and out) but amazon.com replaced it immediately - sent the new one before we had sent back the damaged one.
4,awesome toy,"I bought our son one at the local ToysR Us and they were very clear about pointing out the required battery pack. I really don't know why people seem to miss this, just like almost all other r/c toys, electronic toys, etc... it clearly states on the package what is required for batteries. And if you check it out on the Tyco r/c site it says it doesn't come with a battery.btw - 27mhz and 49mhz tell what frequency the radio works on. If you have more than one kid and they each want one make sure you get one on 27mhz and one on 49mhz otherwise they won't be able to use them together."
4,Better than expected,"I purchased the shellshocker for my grandson for Christmas.....well.....it ended up in a stopped up drain pipe that was filled with water. My husband and son began to dig out the stopped up end of the pipe....when the pipe was cleaned out...out came the shell shocker! We figured that the shocker was ruined because it had been in water for about 30 minutes, but after blowing it off and letting it dry out, it stilled worked....the only problem is that it does not completely turn into a ball now....but it is still great fun and my grandson loves it."
2,"Great, but it broke within a few days","My 9 and 7 year olds had a blast - until it broke within a few days use. The side plastic rim cracked - making it completely inopperable. It immediately went from a ""5"" to a ""1"". Too bad, because it was a fun toy - for the few days it actually worked. Wouldn't recommend it others."
2,Seems great...at first...,"I bought this for my son for Christmas (after paying too much for the beast, plus the battery pack) and it was awesome! My 6 year old son took it outside and wore the battery out. Then he had to wait...EVERY time he wanted to play with it, he had to WAIT for the battery to charge. After a while, he rarely played with it. Then it broke. One of the plastic arms broke off, which means that the other arms eventually broke off, too. DO NOT BUY!"
2,Very very fragile.,"The fine print on the box tells you this is a ""multi-terrain"" vehicle, instead of an ""all terrain"" vehicle, this is because while they advertise it to go through sand, and grass, and mud, what they actually mean is that it will go through dry sand, such as you would find in a desert, dry grass, such as you would find on the african savannah, and dry mud, such as you would find in their fertile imagination. Mine has shorted out and stopped working just going through dewey grass."
3,Thank goodness I found a battery 2 days before Xmas,"How come I could had swore that the battery was included. Never thought twice about it until last night when I started wrapping the christmas gifts. I saved that one for last and realized that the battery was not included. I prayed that walmart still had some in stock, thinking to myself, how would my son feel getting up and can't even play with the toy because Santa didn't bring a battery for it. But all in all I did get the battery but darn I done payed about 100 dollars now for everything."
1,RIP-OFF,"This toy has left us shell-shocked. The fact that it doesn't come with the battery it needs to work is ridiculous, as is the fact that it broke within one day of purchase. It wouldn't morph and only sporadically moved around. The replacement that was sent (after paying for shipping of the remote back to the company) also lasted for one day. When it worked, my 7 year-old son LOVED it, but that just meant he was devastated when it stopped working both times. Now we have two huge pieces of plastic that don't do anything. When you're charging nearly $100 for a toy, the expectation is that it will work for longer than a day. Save your money!"
5,The Biggest Job We&#65533;ll Ever Have by Laura and Malcolm Gauld,"This is a fantastic book that focuses on the importance of character development in our children, and it provides an outline of how to achieve it. The book is well written and easy to understand. Suggestions for ""homework"" at the end of many chapters are highly effective and provide a mechanism to start using the tools that are introduced in the book. Not only has Hyde provided our son the tools to work toward his unique potential; as parents of a Hyde student, the lives of my wife and myself, our relationship, and our relationship with our other children, have been enriched by our efforts to follow these guidelines. In a society where cheating, dishonesty, and self-destructive behavior are all too common, this book is a must read for all educators, all teachers, all parents, and even couples without children! Having read the book, I am now buying copies for all of my friends."
3,Sitting in the big chair,Won't lie. I got this CD for one song. It was cheaper than getting it off of iTunes and now I have the entire album! Brings back the memories of when radio didn't suck.
3,nice,‘Bonding’ Project. Makes for good story-telling time. It brought back a lot of pleasant memories and allowed me to share them with my grandson and ‘stretched’ his mind a bit as well.
5,WONDERFUL,"This book is very good. It tells about all of the items in the game and how much u can get if you ship them. It also includes all of the recipes for cooking, over 200! The map in this game is 100% correct(the other person just cant read one!)To sum it all up this book talks about tolls, fishing, mining, farming, caring for animals, selling, making friends and get a spouse. It also includes maps. Plus it covers Harvest Moon: DS. THIS BOOK ROCKS"
1,Not a great game guide,"I'm new to the Harvest Moon series and received Magical Melodies as a Christmas gift. I'm not that impressed with the game and even less impressed with the game guide. The game guide is confusing and doesnt give good details. I've bought other guides in the past and have been pretty satisfied. If your new to the series, the guide should be able to answer simple questions, but it doesn't. I agree with the other reviewers, wait until you can get the guide online."
1,Good luck getting it,I ordered this in mid-October for Christmas. I am still waiting (mid February).
3,Munchhausen,The film was everything I expected it would be. My wife is German and she likes the older films and stars. We both thought it was quite good and enjoyed it alot. I would recommend it to anyone who likes older German films in German and were you can remove the subtitles.
4,"good songs, bad mixes","This album includes all of Paulina's singles, if you are a new fan of hers this album is great for you. Another good thing about this album is that it has a really nice desing with cool pictures. But if you already have her albums and you are just going to buy this one for the mixes, forget it they are really bad, the production of the mixes is very poor, they sound really cheap."
2,OKAY!!!,"Yes I love Pau! But Latin labels tend to release to many greatest hit collections of the same songs, in different order from each other, The only difference is the album cover, This top hits is okay, But I have 3 different PAU collections, same songs, They need to wait to put all her old hits and present hits with 2 new tracks or hot mixes something to make it cool. But I recommend for all PAU fans.."
1,JUST A HISTORY,"Certainly, a documentary of one of the most prolific R&B love song composers of all time can be appreciated by his most dedicated fans. However, the positive raving by these other reviewers sadly misses the point in this case. There is not one decent DVD concert of this legendary artists anywhere! The live in Germany DVD is absolutely terrible! Its the worst Barry White perforance I have ever seen, and I have been a fan since his very first release. I collect DVD concerts, and live in Germany should be burned at the stake. How sad that such a wonderful and talented artist who thrilled millions of people for decades should pass away without one single decent video concert for his fans. So, why celebrate a documentary of the man, without the benefit of also having his incredible talent immortalized on a video concert for the world to also celebrate? Without that...its ""Just a History."""
2,Barry White Lover,"I was disappointed in this dvd. I thought it would have more Barry White songs on it. Actually, this dvd is a semi-documentary which is told from Barry White's daughter's perspective -- in other words, a very one-sided story -- it seems as though the whole truth is untold. There's a battle going on with Barry's children vs. his young girlfriend at the end of his life. The story should either be told or left totally out of the video. If you're looking for a dvd of Barry's performances and songs, this is definitely not the dvd to purchase."
5,Fantastic service,"This saga has a happy ending. I ordered the lime vest and tie for my son for prom. It was received promptly, however, we discovered he needed a small instead of the medium we ordered. I emailed the company and there was no problem with the size exchange. I received it in a matter of days after returning the vest and tie. Then a month later my son's date has a different color prom dress. So I again emailed the company and asked if they would please once more exchange the vest 2 weeks before the prom. I promised if she changed her dress again I would not as for another exchange! They were most kind and said certainly and again within a matter of days after returning the lime green vest and tie I receieved the cream vest and tie. I cannot say enough about their prompt email responses and unbelievable customer service. You won't go wrong with this company."
2,Skip this one,"This is a terrible review book. It is long winded and overdrawn, exactly what you do not want in a review book. A review book should be concise and easy to digest so you get the most bang for your time and effort. This is not even close.It does have a few redeeming qualities. Some nice charts are present and there is also a list of composers in the rear with their dates. Very handy. Perhaps this is good for lifting the charts and lists, but you'll give yourself a headache trying to read this one."
1,Help me Im pretending to dream,"If this is one of the best African books I shutter to think what the rest are like. Obviously war is hell and nothing is more hellish than an African war of tribes killing tribes and Africans stealing, raping and doing whatever bad things they want to do to each other with no culture, religious beliefs or police to stop them. So life has been hellish for the main characters of this book (a child and an old man) and probably that is why the author feels free to make up a story of ghosts and goblins and things that go bump in the night. Its not science fiction exactly but close to it."
2,Little parts are funny...but still pretty lame,"I thin tom green is(was)kinda funny(although annoying) on his MTV show...and also i think Jason Lee is quite good also.But this movie just doesnt spark any amount of solid laughs,mediocreones maybe if that.All in all Tom Green just is'nt an ""Actor"" and he shouldnt try to be one either,he should stick best to doing what he does best.Being an annoying idiot:)"
2,Tom Green never breaks out into complete weirdness,"When watching this film, I expected Tom Green to act like he did in Freddy Got Fingered, a movie that I actually enjoyed. He seems to hold back, which drags the whole movie into a boring state. There are funny scenes, like the man who forces other men to spoon with him and concludes ""in case you're wondering, I'm not gay."" Jason Lee is funnier in films directed by Kevin Smith, but I really expected more since this film was directed by Bruce McCullouch of Kids in the Hall fame. The only good he does is his brief cameo as Lee's unexperienced, negative attorney.The DVD comes with numerous trailers from other [...] movies released by Revolution Films, and some deleted scenes."
2,Only laughed once,"I saw this movie and hated it. This movie is so stupid it makes 'Road Trip' look great. There's a quote in the movie, the only funny part 'This is bad. This is really bad' This quote can sum the movie up too."
5,Amazing,"This movie was hilarious. The only reason I wen to see it was because Bruce McCulloch directed. I thought Tom Green was totally gonna ruin the film but suprisingly he was quite good in it. And Bruce is in it for like a minute, I was so suprised I almost stopped breathing!! Amazing film, even if Bruce hadn't directed it I still would have loved it!..."
1,What a stupid movie!,"OK, I know Tom Green has a crazy sense of humor, but this film was just stupid! It wasn't even about Harvard! Sure it was about trying to seal money to pay for Harvard, but it was mostly about how two stupid guys can't get anything to work. Should be titled, ""How Two Stupid Guys Couldn't Steal Harvard"" or something to that effect. The comedy was relly raw, and the levels which they had to go to to try and get you to laugh were quite low. This film truly left me feeling dumber after watching it. Don't waste your time!"
5,"""I'm not liquid, Jon. I'm not...liquid!""","This movie is hilarious. Jon Plummer (Jason Lee) made a promise to his niece when she became eliminated from an elementary school spelling bee that he'd pay her way to college. Unfortunately, he told her that to make her feel better, so now that his niece is all grown up, and he promised to pay for her tuition, he has to figure out a way to get $30,000.To be honest, Tom Green's character ""Duff"" had me laughing all throughout the movie. Yes, you read correctly. Tom Green is funny in this movie. I know, I know. He's an acquired taste, but in this movie, he's actually watchable (I've always thought he was somewhat watchable, and yes, I have seen ""Freddy Got Fingered"" twice -- out of boredom, of course). I recommend this to Tom Green or Jason Lee fans!"
1,Hated it! Sorry!,This movie is so incredibly boring and not funny by any means!Go back and rewrite the script because this movie goes nowhere.Why waste my time on this?
4,Good but dated,I bought this book as I was going to be coaching young house league goalies. I am a goalie myself but wanted to get some expert advice on how to teach it. The book is a revised addition & some of it reads dated. Though it does a good job of explaining the basics for beginners I can't see anyone older getting much out of it.
4,Ian Young,I have not read the book but as a youngster I was taught by two of the best John Reinhart and Ian Young.
2,Careful about buying BN publishing Books,"This is not the only Joel S Goldsmith title that BN has altered. Wouldn't recommend. I purchased this particular book and really regret having done so. I ordered another one by Devorss and company, the June 1980 version."
1,BN Publishing Unreliable for Goldsmith Readers,BN Publishing is making many changes to Goldsmith's work. Beware and avoid. The original of this title is a fine book.
2,not original,it is not the original. It has been changed and I would not recommend any Infinite Way student to purchase from this publisher
3,Copyright,"I was amazed that someone could copy a book already in print. The original pages were simply copied onto a larger page but the material retained the original size print and margins.The text is the same, as I had hoped. A plus for this would be, I guess, that the reader could make notes without any problem right on the page and have plenty of room. I am assuming that someone with authority at Joel Goldsmith's organization did this. Since the text is the same I am not returning the book. Trudy Charlton"
4,Merengue CD with current as well as classic hits,"This is a good compilation of merengue classics as well as current hits. I got my CD through Amazon and just to note that the song ""El Guaba"" is sung by none other than Celia Cruz (the CD cover also shows her name, not the other name listed on this Amazon page). She was not known to sing much merengue at all so this is a rare one - great merengue song. My favorites are ""Suavemente"", ""El Guaba"", ""El Tiburon"", and ""Cama y Mesa"". You won't find ""El Guaba"" by Celia Cruz anywhere else."
4,ripe (with decay),"Despite your personal tastes, interests, and/or religious beliefs, Antichrist Superstar is a great album. Not only great from the standpoint of musical content and production (Marilyn Manson should eternally kiss Trent Reznor's ass for making his career) but also great for all that it represented. EVERYONE's parents hated Marilyn Manson. It was a return to basics for rock and roll, and the angst-ridden goth kids of America thanked him in abundance for it. There is some very good material here, particularly the title track, Tourniquet, The Beautiful People, 1996, and the morosely elegant Man That You Fear. As mentioned before, the production is a key element in the album's potency. Nine Inch Nails auteur Trent Reznor manned the controls for this one, providing decayed and ambient atmospherics as groundwork for the riff-heavy industrial monolith that Manson provided. This proved to be the pinnacle of Manson's death rock perversions, and it remains a career-defining accomplishment"
5,The definitive Marilyn Manson album,"I personally love this album, and it's universally accepted that this is one of his best works, if not the best. All the songs a lot of meaning and the listener can defiantly connect to them. This is also a concept album and I think that it tells the story quite well. If you call yourself a Marilyn Manson fan and you haven't bought what is arguably his best work then pull out some cash and buy it now!"
4,THIS ALBUM HAS THE EDGE BECAUSE OF TRENT REZNOR!!!,"I THINK THIS ALBUM WAS GREAT ONLY BECAUSE OF TRENT. HE HELPED WITH THE BEST SONGS ON IT LIKE MANS THAT YOU FEAR FOR EXAMPLE. AS FOR MECHANICAL ANIMALS. I WOULD KINDA BE ASHAMED EVEN CALLING THAT A MANSON ALBUM. I ONLY LIKE MECHANICAL ANIMALS, ROCK IS DEAD IS OK, SPEED OF PAIN, I DON'T LIKE THE DRUGS IS OK, POSTHUMAN, AND COMA WHITE. AND WHY ISN'T IT THAT GREAT YOU SAY??? BECAUSE TRENT DIDN'T HELP. IF I WERE YOU, I'D BY THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL BY NIN IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT."
5,One of my all time favorite albums,"This is classic Manson back when he was at the height of terrorizing midwestern parents. This album is dark and weird and though Manson has become pretty pase at this point, I still think this is a great album 10 years later."
4,Not as good as I expected it to be,"I brought this CD cause ""The Beautiful People"" is a great song. The album is good, but Manson doesn't sing very well in this album. The voice is more clear in Mechinical Animals and HolyWood. Portrait of an American Family is supposedly his best CD, but I never brought it. Still I would recommend Holywood and The Last Tour on Earth."
3,"A good, but not the darkest CD","To quote the people who say that this is one of the darkest albums around. This is most definitely not the darkest album around. If you are looking for stuff that is hardcore and pre Evil, check out metal bands like Emperor, Cradle of Filth and Dark Throne, which Manson is pop in comparison to. On the other hand, this is a great album of whatever you want to call it (and no, it is not industrial). Has some great combinations of Metal guitar, drumming and raspy vocals. I find that in some of the songs Manson gets a bit side-tracked, which ruins the song and makes it sound bland."
2,"""The Beautiful People"" is the only good song.","I like the new glam-rock Manson much better. This music is so loud that all that you hear is a bunch of dischordant noises. ""The Beautiful People"" is excellent, but even that can't save this cd. Marilyn was too homoerotic with the artwork, it is REALLY Satanistic, and well, it just isn't that good. ""Mechanical Animals"" is perfect for him. Him and his band sound fabulous. I truly hope that they stay that way. They should never return to this phase. It's disgusting."
2,Not that good...,"I could only enjoy a few songs off this album. Some of the songs just sound like plain noise, just annoying.I enjoyed tracks 1,2,3,4, and after that, it was a not-so-good mixed bag. Pick up ""Mechanical Animals"" instead."
5,Did anyone not see this comning??,"People are always talking about how bad Marilyn Manson is. Well most likely these same people are adults who listen(or listened to)several ""sadistic"" bands. Like:Black Sabbath, KISS, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Alice Cooper, Ozzy Osbourne, etc, etc, etc, do you get my point yet? Anyway all Marilyn Manson is, is a more aggressive version of these bands, Manson are not watered down in any way about their music. You could almost say it is an evolution of shock-rock. From medicore to aggressive! Anyway this is an pretty cool album to check out if you like rock and are not affended easily."
2,Shocking! Scandalous! Puh-lease...,"I suppose this album deserves some credit as a cultural phenomenon, but as music, as such, it'll get no credit from me. If you want to hear something really depraved, if you want this type of music done well, you have to go find some Scratch Acid or Birthday Party. You can thank me later, kids."
1,Poorest of his albums,"Unstructured, tedious and really not very well produced. How people rate this as his finest escapes me. Holy Wood is FAR better as is Mechanical Animals. Forget this junk and get his later work. This is MESS of the highest order! More like a rough demo CD than an album worth purchasing. ..."
3,derivative but insightful,"I like to call this record ""death pop."" I'm surprised more people haven't noticed how Trent lifted and watered down Fear Factory's sound (Demanufacture) to make this record.So, while this isn't the real thing, it's saved by Marilyn Manson's caustic lyrics on Beltway morality. Unlike Trent, Manson is on the joke and writes a bruising, offensive satire on middle-class Christian culture. I don't necesarilly agree or disagree with his viewpoints, but it's rare to read anything this intelligent anymore in mainstream rock."
5,When hell becomes heaven...,"I was in my early teens when MM came on the scene. My mother was a religious zealot who convinced me that MM was a deranged mouthpiece of the devil. I eventually came to leave my conservative, repressive upbringing behind, but I will always wish I could go back in time & go to an MM concert during this era. This album is amazing.Highlights:Angel with the Scabbed Wings-- This has an addictive tribal-like beat that will make you want to move. My favorite on this CD.Antichrist Superstar-- A high-energy frolick into the world of MM. I love it when he growls ""repent""! ;)Tourniquet-- A lovely little dark song. Feel the angst. Ahh.The rest is good too, but those are my favorites. Buy this, but be forewarned: MM will ruin it for other music!"
5,"Powerful music, Powerful man","What can I say? I love this guy and I love this album. He has a strong voice, an incredible presence, and the lyrics and music are absolutely outstanding.My favorite song on this album is Tourniquet. It's a dark, erotic piece which, like the rest of this incredible album, has intoxicating lyrics, a strong rhythm and is definitely Manson at his best.In a nutshell, the man is a genius."
5,Gloriously Twisted,"The release of Antichrist Superstar was the height of Manson's Career, it encompasses such classics as Beautiful People and Antichrist Superstar.To Begin this review I would like to state that ys the album is dark and perverse but that is its intention after all it is metal music. Posting bad reviews and unopinionated reviews is unhelpful and people like that form the 'bad name' associated with Metal.When Listening to this album I immediately fell in love with it it is alive with influence (after all music is PROGRESSIVE) and provides a sarcastic and twisted view at modern society and shouts out the dark parts of ourselves. If you can see past the 'label' created around 'Marilyn Manson' and compared it to other albums released at the same time and of a similar genre this album definately stood out.Otherwise why would the band be legendary for social criticism?In ending I would like to say this must be one of my favourite albums of all time."
3,2 great songs....and a bunch of noise,"This CD has got two great songs, ""The Beautiful People and Dried Up, Tied Up and Dead to the World"". The rest of the CD is truly a bunch of talent free noise."
2,very average,"this release has about three good songs and that's it.do yourself a favor and buy their""Portrait Of An American Family""cd and hear some real damage!"
1,Sickest Person Alive!!!!!!!!,"Marilyn Manson is one of the sickest most evil people ever!! I don't know how anyone could listen to his disgusting adhorrent awful music. You have to be like really insane and crazy to like this nutcase. The things he does and stuff he says is not even describable. UH!!!! Enough said!!!!!(i hope you like hell ""Brian Hugh Warner"")"
1,Y`all need JESUS CHRIST FOR REAL...!!!,"This is Garbage trash, 000 stars this is not music.How can y`all say that scream profenities to God is good. Every one of you should be ashamed of yourselves.And yeah I post it here because my neighbor have this disgusting and stupid bullcrapt in there stereo player. Y`all got better going to go to church soon or your lifes will suffer a lot with this negative music. REMEMBER THAT GOD LOVES YOU ALWAYS NO MATTER WHAT...!!!!!!!"
1,uh....... this ain't music-,"This is for those who:1. Want to burn in hell2. Really think this guy is talented (but is not)3. Enjoy worshipping satan.Come on guys, this is junk. Everyone of his albums and everything he does is sick. Demented and out of touch with reality.Almost worse than Cannibal Corpse."
1,getgo,"Friend? introduced me to this satan worshiper? and sum years later I listened to my roommate in college and threw it in the dumpster-- anyone in my opinion that goes on MTV and appears occult, then opinions will be, but honestly, as I threw the album away i felt a presence lift out of my body."
1,"Who would even buy an album titled ""Antichrist Superstar"", in the first place???????????","I don't think I could like anyone who listens to this. This ""music"" sucks, and dont give me that crap about the album ""tells a story"" and has ""great lyrics"".Wow.Go buy some Red Hot Chili Peppers or some Pearl Jam.Pearl Jam is a band with ""great"" lyrics."
4,long road outa hell!,"www.iniquityclothing.comNow in my opinion this is by far MM's finest release! The whole feel of this album right from the outset lures you into his world of make believe horror! The defineing song on this album, which is comparable to ""Holywoods - Fight Song"" is definately ""1996"". It rolls off of your tongue if your singing in the shower but still has manson's signature hard edge. A definate christmas goodie for any fan of the darker side of goth Rock,8 out of 10 for listen ability"
5,Manson hits gold again,"Well, I think Manson is brilliant on many fronts - musically, intellectually, and marketing-wise. But many will agree with me that this is a must-have album. Very bitter, yet sensitive and teetering between varying degrees of harshness. Start to finish the tracks are beautifully entwined and it finishes with one of - in my opinions - Manson's best songs ever.The album is more polished than previous albums but not as poppy as some of Manson's later works. In my opinion, this is one of the most influential albums of the 90's, and also set the precedent for Manson as not only a name, but - as his band farcically mimics - an American icon."
4,Well more like 4.5 stars,First off I am a Christian. but putting all the antichrist reefrences aside on this album it is one of my favorite cd's ever. The song's are awsome. Irrespnsible Hate Anthem is one of my faves. This cd is perfect to get pumped up for a big game or anything. and when you think your ear drums are about to explode Manson comes at you with a slower more haunting song. Man you fear is probably one of my all time favorite songs. Get this cd. you won't be sorry.
5,An album that'll leave scars on your heart,"Its hard to classify this cd. It goes from the glam sarcasm of wormboy, to the spooky autobiographic kinderfeld with almost no effort. I became a manson fan after buying mechanical animals, so i bought ACSS thinking it would be similar. I was very wrong. While animals was glittery, meaningful and very reminiscent of david bowie, Antichrist has the kind of bleak story thats portrayed with such realism that it can reduce you to tears within the first few tracks. The best peice on here is definitely Man that you fear, and song that has the antichrist holding the world in his hands and about to crush it, and looking back on his lost innocence and the parents who betrayed him. Its the bitter finality of the electronic choirs and rhodes piano (suppplied by trent reznor) that makes the song one of the rare gems that have no equal. Be prepared to cry."
5,Great album,"This is my favorite Manson CD, if you like the sound of NIN 'Broken' you should love this CD. Powerful and very dark. This disc just rocksHad it forever still play it once a week.Get over the hype and use those ears. You may be impressed."
5,"oh, yeah","manson is like a good butt plug, greasy, dirty, and full of v.d. this cd reminds me of that time brian warner and i went down on each other in a mca backlot. when i put in in my cd player, i cannot help but thinking oh the burning sensation i felt when peeing after a hot night with mm."
2,Sorry Mansonites,"It is an ok album but hardly one I would recommend listening to. The lyrics are b.s., the music is decent but only through Trent Reznor's obvious influence and production savvy. In other words the only reason this album even sold at all was either through Trent Reznor's production or Manson's stage antics. Stick with Nine Inch Nails."
2,Not much to see here,"I have really high regards for Reznor, being a fan of NIN for a good amount of time, I figured I'd give his protege of some sort, Manson a try, the way I've always felt that he is more of a gimmick than a musician, or the image being more important than the actual value of his music. I gave AS a try, and wasn't really surprised. 'The Beautifle People', his most famous song, is really great and catchy, but when it comes down to it, the remainder of this album is really mediocre and not memorable. It also sounds quite egotistical, even if that may be meant to be taken as ironic."
5,great cd,when i first heard this cd i didnt like it but then it grew in me and now its one of my fav manson albums
3,Stole A Lot From Earlier Artists,"Alice Cooper, Kiss, and Skinny Puppy. Manson stole a lot from those bands especially in this record. Even the live show for Anti-Christ Superstar had a lot in common with some of the stuff done on Skinny Puppy's Last Rights tour. At least he knows who to steal from and it's still entertaining regardless."
3,Freak or Fake,"Manson is without a doubt one of the sickest individuals to ever come along in music. This is probaly the hardest of his offerings and the most raw. Manson has some very freakish ideas about the world,people,God and Government. Althouth i do not agree with his outlandish opinions he does have some catchy tunes that will probaly become classic over time. I have 4 Manson cds and this one is the most brutal even above Holywood I think. Like one review said all you need of Manson is the greatest hits and you have him in a nutshell. I gave this a 3 because he does have good technical production even thought this cd is not the best at that. He does seem intelligent but so did some of the most notorous serial killers also and look what they did. If you never heard Manson try the Lest we Forget Cd first and see what this freak has to offer."
3,A pretty good marketing plan!,"Give this guy credit, he was M & M before there even was an Eminem!! Ha ha!!But I digress...The real credit goes to Interscope for creating a martian out of thin air and making him (and them) a millionaire several times over.Long live rock & roll."
4,From someone who didn't know Marilyn Manson...,I had never really heard Marilyn Manson before I won this CD from my local radio station and when I gave it a liston I found the lyrics to be inspiring and very articulate with the mediphoric imagry. The music it self was driven with hard back beats and amazing synthisized gutar tracks. If you buy only one M.M. CD this is the one you should get!
4,Marilyn Manson Gives Us Really Something To Listen To,"Marilyn Manson's third album ""Antichrist Superstar"" is a blast of an eerie effort. A bit overlong, maybe, but it punches hard at life, death, poverty, love, sadness, eagerness, and boredom. There are a great amount of things to listen to like electronic effects, metal guitar crunch, audio effects, and great vocals by Manson himself. The use of the mellotron and theramin on ""Cryptorchid"" gives me goosebumps. The stand-out track ""Beautiful People"" is a look at one man's anger at reality and is effective in delivery. It also packs a great beat complete with heavy guitar crunch and vocal effects. ""Tourniquet"" is another one that made the pop scene and just clicks! Of course, Marilyn Manson is not for all tastes, but recommended for listeners who do not judge him by image. It's just music. A great effort."
5,i loved this cd one of his best!!!,i love this cd beacause his songs make sense at times but then they dont.he has the best voice and he does have some good meanings to his songs. he is so fine also. i am a freak but not obsesed. well yes i am obsesedi even drew a pic of him. its pretty good.
5,Star Manson,"Brian Warner has beat the odds and strived for exellence. This band has gone from black and back. I am really proud to say I am a true fan of the band . I encourage this band to keep on going and accomplish all there goals in life. It is hard as it is now in days to be judged by "" Society "" and still get what you want from life. Mariliyn Manson's cd Antichrist Super Star was a great hit, and I loved it so much!. He really expresses his feelings threw his music. If people took time and read about Brian Warner they would really be amazed. I have read all about Warner and the band and it is really amazing. So strive for exellence and get the point threw all of these narrow minded pepole."
4,Viscerally Amazing; Compelling Goth-Industrial Rock Album,"Marilyn Manson unleashes an industrial playground with Antichrist Superstar, an aural sensory overload that writhes in its doom and gloom. Perhaps the greatest achievement here is that Marilyn and co. can terrorize and genuinely torment their listener into a reclusive but appreciative darkness without seeming insincere or campy. An essential 90's recording... Best Songs: ""The Beautiful People,"" ""Deformography,"" ""Man That You Fear"" Rating: 8/10"
5,It rockssssss,Antichrist Superstar is one of my favorite albums!!! I like it better than Mechanical Animals...but Mechanical Animals is still a good album. There shouldn't be any Manson fans without this cd. You should probably buy some of the other old cds too before getting the new one...
4,it's good and different...,I'd like to answer to those who said that manson had no talent: You are wrong! He's not full of talent but album after album you can see a change and an improvement. Those who says that he's trent reznor puppet...listen to mechanical animal...i'm not sure but I don't think that manson had reznor as a producer.
3,The CD that could've been,"I believe this album was a waste of potential. Many of the songs start with a strong sound, but either get repetitive or fall apart altogether. There are highlights (The Beautiful People, The Reflecting God, and 1996 come to mind), but there are enough half written songs (Minute of Decay, many others) to make this album mediocre. Too bad, it could've been great. I'm looking forward to their next release, though - they have potential."
4,My fav,"This album is awsome! But there are a few songs that really suck like 6,11,14,7,8 (ok but still),3, and few others but songs like 10,12,13,1,2,5 (ok), 15 (ok), are awsome. If your gonna buy this new its worth it. Just stay away from smells like children."
2,what's the hype?,"i don't see the hype of this album. it's nowhere near as good as Portrait. the majority of songs on this album are just mindless anthems of hate. a few good tracks are ""minute of decay, mr. superstar, and deformography"" the irresponsible hate anthem and antichrist superstar maybe good if you are one of those people stuck in a self-pity party and mad at the world. 1996 is just a useless rant about hating the world, i just don't see the point. Portrait is a great album as is mechanichal animals."
3,Antichrist Superstar!,"Maybe it's me but I didn't get the album. First I'm always told what it's about but one thing fustrates me that is. I can't hear what MM is saying. Maybe mr. Warner himself wanted to make that somehow translate to something bizzare and mysterious. Musically this album is okay. However it's a bit overproduced. Not that I have anything against that but when it comes to metal it matters. I am no hard Core metal fan but I do sometimes like hard music and I often find Hard Rock and Metal best when it's not produced the way this album is. The music gets it's share but the producer who may have focused to much on the music and totally forgot the frontman. He totally ingores his role in the group and that is singing. There are lot of flaws in this album and I don't what to count them all here, one may be that this album contains to musch filler. However the artwork and the concept was a brilliant idea and some of the songs are excellent. So I'll Give it three stars."
3,If Alice Cooper had no talent,"Most of the music here is pretty bad, but this freak has a message here. If there was only song to go with it, he'd do better getting his message across. You can't make people listen to what you have to say if you hide it behind noise. Some of this stuff isn't all that bad because the production is good, but there is no talent as far as playing goes."

1,"really, 0 stars","this guy is just a pompous bag of douche. i don't give a f*ck what he says about religion, he can bash it all he wants and it makes no difference to me, he and his ""band"" are just so incredibly untalented, that is why i hate this crap!! this guy has a FOLLOWING!! HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE HIM? i don't wear black with black makeup and black fingernail polish and scream anguish at the world, and i know actual musical TALENT when i hear it, so i guess i'll never get it."
4,Appearences aren't Everything....,"Aside from the fact that Manson is visually repulsive, and his messages are taken to heart by millions of angst ridden adolescents the album is great. I have always been a fan of heavy music, and heavy this is. For those of you that scoff at Manson, this ablum stands up on it's own. I am sure that much of the credit is due Reznor, but nonetheless it's a great listen."
4,WARNING: IT'S NOT HARDCORE,"It contains synthesizer; if you can't accept that fact, F*** YOU!!! I like synth music and i like creepy music and I like all things dark and disturbing and/or depressing. This is almost a pop record except for it's ""un""-mainstream concept(s); sometimes it's even fun and upbeat. Sometimes it's spine-tinglingly creepy (but only if you listen to it on rare occassion(s)) and sometimes it's a little bit experiemental sounding. Perhaps it's what you could call a ""cross-over"" record, but whatever you call it, I think it's a thrilling record and worthy of repeated listening."
4,Shock-schlock but worth a listen.,"I must admit I didn't like this album at first. I heard Mechanical Animals first and thought it superior, more accessible. But with this record, after you strip away the things done for shock value, shows a group willing to work hard at their craft, and take the pains to produce a really good record. That is why AntiChrist Superstar won't fade away into the category filled with other ""satanic"" recordings. It's not a masterpiece, but for it's genre, it's close enough."
2,"Overwhelming, poorly prepared booklet.","I have listened to these CDs four times by now. Overall, I am greatly disappointed with the way the program is designed. The French actors speak very fast and are hard to understand. By lesson 3 almost everything is WAY over my head. The program seems to be designed for people who already know quite a bit of French and just need to brush-up on grammar. If you remember everything 100% when you first hear it and your brain work as fast as a very good computer, this course is for you. The provided booklet documents only about 15% of the CD course and often doesn't mach the presented material in substantial ways. I am going to look for a different course and return to this one only occasionally. I guess it's good for simulating the feeling of being in France and trying to learn the language from TV and radio. Date references indicate that it was put together between 1990 and 1995."
1,useless,"This is one of the worst instructional sets I've ever heard. it deserves no stars. How they thought this would actually help you learn french I don't understand. there is no repetition, no progression, no flow, no basic precepts for teaching! I have nominal french skills and kept listening to this hoping it would help me improve, but non.Get something else like Michel Thomas's or anything else!"
1,Tired of Texas,"How many times can one author refer to the state of TX in one book? At many places throughout, you cannot go even a whole page without seeing the word. It's used so much, it just got to be silly. And the story isn't all that great. Like the other reviewer said, you don't really care what happens to the characters. It's not often that I start a book and not finish it, and this was one of them."
1,To Tease A Texan,"There was no substance to this book. And how many times does the author think she has to beat the reader over the head with comments like, ""I am a Texan"", or ""Damn that Texan""? I got the fact that the main characters are both from Texas after it was mentioned ten or twelve times within the first twenty pages. I could not even finish this one. There was nothing in it to make me care about what happened to the characters."
3,The ok book for fantasy likers,"this was an ok book. It is very wishy washy in the middle but around the 22 chapter it started to get better and more exciting and suspenciful now that meryl is dying of the disease called the Gray Death. it is killing people all over Bamarre. let me tell you the story of the 2 princesses of bamarre.[ the short version] The 2 princesses of bamarre and they are very close to each other. Addie is the weaker and more afraid one. Meryl is the braver and stronger one. Then one day Meryl gets sick with the Gray death and Addie sets out to find the cure. now when Addie has to overcome her fears and save Addie she also has to face dragons, griffons, and other mystical creatures. will addie save her life on a tight scheduele."
5,A fantastic book!,"This is the story of two princesses - Addie and Meryl. Meryl, the older princess, is brave and bold. Meryl's younger sister, Addie can be fearful and timid. Meryl and Addie are best friends, and each other's favorite companions. They spend time playing games with each other. Their favorite game is the Gray Death game. In this game, Addie will pretend to catch the Gray Death, a feared disease that is guaranteed to kill of its victim. Then, Meryl will pretend to search for the cure. In the game, Meryl will find it, and bring it to Addie, who will get well again. Then, Meryl falls ill with the Gray Death, and this time it is not a game. Addie knows she must find the cure to save her sister, but to do so, she must face her greatest fears. I thought this was a beautifully written book that keeps the reader turning the pages, and I also like that this book can be unpredictable at times. This a is great, creatively written story!"
5,GO ADDIE!!!,"Okay, you're going to love this book!!!!Addie and Meryl are sisters and best friends though they are like day and night. Meryl has always been the brave, the strong, the protector of shy, scared Addie.But when Meryl falls to the Gray Death, the roles get reversed and Addie must find her courague to go out of her secure little world and find the cure to her sister's illines.On her quest she'll face her deepest fears... with Meryl's - and Bamare's - fate in her hands Addie's time is running out.Look out for other charactes, like Rees, Bella, Dru and much more!!Oh, and the Dragon rocks!!!"
3,Good Summer Book,"This is what I have come to call a rennaissace chick flick of a book. The story was a bit bland but still fun. A book about sisters who are so polar in the character and talents yet are so closely tied. I hope everyone reads this book, even tough ella enchanted is so so good too. You cannot just skip over this one. It is a fun, and quick read."
2,The two princesses of Bamarre,"After the rave reviews this book got at amazon.com, I bought it and was expecting nothing short of the next JK Rowling. I was dissapointed. I found the characters a bit flat, the two princesses a bit dense, and the lore of the land superficial. The character I related to most was killed (a dragon) for no good reason. The king is the most irritating character I have encounter for a while. Someone should have assasinated him. I struggled to finish it. The book has absolulty no humor in it. Zero. An unnecessary grim depiction of a fantasy land. This books charm completely eluded me."
3,not levine's best work,"I've read two other books by Levine (Ella Enchanted and The Wish) and enjoyed both, but this book actually feels like a pain. I think that the lead character is the princess who is more cowardly instead of the braver one is a great idea, and the inclusion of the epic hero is definitely amusing, but other than those two and maybe a couple more, there's hardly any reason to recommend this book.It feels like the author rushes through things; she moves from a problem to a problem before any feels complete. The rest of the characters (other than the main ones) comes off as kind of weak. And I'm pretty sure we could make do without the falling-in-love subplot, which is really not plausible, important as the marriage is to another subplot.So yeah, I'd recommend Levine's two other books I've read, but not this one."
5,The Dragon Lady,"This book is about two sisters who are very different but very close. There's this fever going around called the gray death, that kills quickly. Meryl, the brave one, comes down with it, and Addie, the timid one, sets out to find the cure. Her journey leads her by dragons, specters, ogres, fairies, and others.Addie, the herione is belivable, but you get so caught up in the story that you don't really pay attention to that sort of thing. Rhys is not quite so realistic, but still a pleasure to read about. And other characters, such as Bella, Milton, and Vollys add life to the story.The first half of this book is good, with a short introduction period in the beginning. The second half is very good also, and keeps you at the edge of your seat.I give this book 4.5 stars.OTHER BOOKS YOU'LL ENJOYElla Enchanted, by Gail Carson LevineThe Water Trilogy, by Kara DalkeyJust Ella, by Margaret Peterson Haddix"
4,Another beautiful and charming story,"I sat in Barnes and Noble for an hour and a half this afternoon because I couldn't put this book down, but couldn't afford to buy it! (still in hardback) This is a lovely tale of two sisters - princesses, but also believable young women. Gail Carson Levine weaves the tale without letting it become dull or cliche. It didn't seem to be quite as elaborate a novel as Ella Enchanted, but wonderful nonetheless. Perfect for all readers."
4,Ella enchanted was much better but this was a great story.,"It was too predectable, I could easly figure out what was comming next. It was a very odd story though and I like that in a book."
2,Dragged down by a dead weight of an ending,"This wasn't such a bad novel, and I kind of enjoyed it. Not great, but easy to read and the story chugs along briskly. However, the ending really killed it for me. It's too unnecessarily long. Once the major conflict is resolved, the story is over and yet we must hear a treatise on what it means to be a faerie and the price paid and the virtue of love and heroism and blah blah blah. I wish I'd just put the book down after the rain because I would've left with a feeling of at least entertainment. But after reading on and realizing that there were no further complications, only pages of explanations, I just lost much of my enthusiasm for the book. Would've been three stars if it'd just known when to end."
4,Pretty good but I found it frustrating,"It drove me crazy that time was ticking away and it seemed impossible that Addie could save her sister. But maybe I am just too impatient. I couldn't read all of the section about being kept prisoner by the dragon because I have claustrophobia.Also, I didn't like the ending but objectively, it was a fitting one."
3,It is okay,"This book is a good book, however I was a little disappointed. I had trouble deciding whether I should give it a 3 or a 4. The story line and the plot is quite good. But the first like nine chapters (short) were dull and slow moving. Once Addie gets on her adventure it becomes very exciting and I didn't want to put the book down. However it was almost painful to read the beginning chapters. The ending is very good though and I would recommend that you borrow it from a friend or library, because it isn't really worth it to buy. I did love Ella Enchanted (the movie was a disappointment) but the two Princesses was a bit disappointing compared to that one. I was looking foward to reading it but I was let down."
4,Pretty good book,"This book was pretty good. The pacing is good, and the characters were fun. The relationship between the sisters and between the sisters and their friends was well written. However, the reason Addie falls in love with one of those friends is not very clear or convincing in my opinion.I did like how Addie manages to defeat most of the monsters without suddenly gaining expert swordsmanship skill (without any training)...though that sudden sword-skill does appear at the very, very end.For those who care, there are a few kisses but no sex.Genre Reviews[...]"
1,worthless,"Not even worth using as a paperweight , I had it sitting on top of my stereo in my house and tried it all over my car and it still didn't do a thing except give me a VERY weak static filled signal , is it possible to give a negative star rating? I wish it was."
2,FM transmitter,Barely worked at home and not at all in either vehicle. I had hoped to be able to play the mp3 player in the car but the static and distortion makes it unplayable. Ended up with a $8 one from a discount store that performed a lot better for 1/4 the price.
3,Thought provoking analysis of portrayal of women in media,"Susan J. Douglas selects prime examples of popular media depictions of women from 1950's to the 1990's and meticulously dissects them, revealing the mixed messages presented to the unwitting public. While Ms. Douglas' analyses are often insightful and enlightening, her point is repeated so often, it becomes annoying. However, parents of young daughters will want to read this book to obtain a better understanding of how the media sends mixed messages about women. After reading this book, it will be difficult to look at magazines, advertisements, commercials, television shows and movies without doing your own critiques on their portrayals of women."
4,great book,"to the reader who stated ""men suck."" you've got feminism all wrong. there is nothing wrong with loving men;it certainly doesn't make you a weak woman. Feminism isn't man-hating unshaven bitter females, but equality of the sexes. A real woman is not afraid of her femininity."
3,"easy to read, but...","this book is very readable, but I found if you do not know much about the tv shows she talks about, it really isn't that interesting or imforative. I do know a bit about I Dream of Jeanie and Bewitched, so I found the particular chapter on these two tv shows very informative. However, some of the other chapters seemed a bit dull if I had no other knowledge of the shows, movies, etc that were being talked about. Don't get me wrong, it is very readable, but for me it was harder to stay with it if I had no prior to fall back on. Also, maybe it was me, but I don't know if it went deep enough into the issue of mass media and how it reflects on women."
1,A huge waste of time,"I had to read this book for a history class at Yale, and I honestly can't believe that a professor would force this book on anyone! It was a simple series of complaints about the presentation of women in the media (some of her complaints are valid, but a lot of time it just seems that she's being overly sensitive). I also found her writing style to be somewhat offensive. It's one of the worst books I've ever had to read for any of the classes I've taken."
2,not great,"Douglas's text may be enjoyable for a book club of aging baby boomers, but has little value to someone truly interested in the historical impact of media in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s on American life. She too often relies on her own memories and experiences, and grossly overestimates the impact of media like the Shirelles, over say...Civil Rights...on feminism. Additionally, she forgets that the leaders of feminism were not teens in the 1960s. Had she focused solely on media in the 1970s, its portrayal of, and impact on feminism, the credibility of the text would be greatly increased."
2,Wolves BluRay,This film was absolutely terrible. For most of the film what you are watching is in a tiny box in the center of the screen with a background image filling up the rest of the TV. My husband didn't even finish watching. It was boring and not about Wolves hardly at all.
5,EverFlex Pain Cream,This is a miracle cream! I have trouble with my lower back which causes pain. I rubbed EverFlex on it and almost instantly the pain subsided. I shared it with my 89 year old dad who also has some back pain and he was totally amazed at the instant relief. I would certainly spread the word about this wonderful product.
2,Way off track,"I see that this film was well liked by some viewers. I believe that this movie failed on three important levels: TV-style music, the lead actor narrated through the whole darn movie (I expect film to show a story as opposed to a book on tape that tells a story) and overall, it failed to intertain."
5,Awesome Movie!,It just does not get any better than this movie.Best made movie since Blade Runner!sound track is super!I wish I had seen this on the Big Screen.
5,Magical moments,"This movie has a fantastic story and because of the story the film is filled with magical moments. Great art piece, great comedic piece, great film. 5 stars."
4,best movie I'd never heard of,"It was a quirky view of how people react to breakups. It's silly, morose, a bit angry, and all together unique."
4,Lovelorn guys will relate to this movie BIG TIME.,"I thought I was in for a british romantic comedy - and I was - but not in the way I was thinking. First, the cover depicts some kind of potential ""Porky's"" type topless nudity - but that is hardly the case. Yes, there is a lot of naked breasts in this flick - but they are on display tastefully, and reflect the POV of the artist and main character of the film. The comedy is rather slight, but the message in the end is perfectly clear. I was happy I took a chance on this film, and you will be too. An excellent film, and a potential all-time favorite."
5,I Love it,I can't even believe its a independent film. This movie is fenominal. It's a great romantic movie and I give it five stars. It's an amazing and a beautiful movie. It has many funny parts which make you laugh and it has a good plot I am going to buy it later on and I recomend you to watch it. I just wish that this movie was more viewed than it is.
5,Unexpected Amazingness,"When I first saw this, it was at a little theater in the west village. I did not know what to expect, but what I found was pretty amazing. This movie was marketed really poorly. The poster seems to show it as some kind of skin flick or something. The reality is that it's a wonderful, artistic film, with a solid plot (something big movies tend to lack) and nonstop entertainment. It moves between serious and artsy and funny, seamlessly. The sequences going back in time are very nice. To anyone who is willing to give this a shot, you will not be disappointed."
3,A great final 10 minutes,"This is an odd little film that mixes dreamy and romantic with Ivan Reitman. Its about a young, depressed, very ordinary art student and his two really beautiful girlfriends. In fact, pretty much all the all the women in this film look like models which is a good thing since its a bit slow. This kid works in a supermarket at night, where he admires the beauty of the women (apparently, only women who are gorgeous shop at this market) and when he gets bored, he freezes time so he can draw them with or without their clothes. Its totally innocent but it isn't really funny, nor are the ultra-stereotype guys he works with at the market. They mix this delicate story with a bit of Welcome Back, Kotter. But I made it through to the end, which you see coming with the art gallery prank. If you can buy into the fantasy, the last few minutes make for a really sweet and visually beautiful ending."
2,So-So Film,"I bought this DVD because of all the rave reviews, but unfortunately I can't give it an equally great review. I thought the original movie short which was also included on the DVD was very good, but the full length movie version of the short seemed labored. Many scenes (such as the soccer game) were added only to increase the length of the short film so it would be a full length movie. On a brighter note, the special effects were very good."
5,Stop in time and watch this movie!,"I came across this movie on Netflix. Overall a great movie. Loved it. The story line is excellent.... boy/girl breakup. Boy is lost without her, can't sleep. He suddenly finds out he can stop time and move around within a stopped moment. He's an artist, he draws the people. He then falls in love with a colleague and realizes how important each moment is that he shares with her. Along the way you meet his friends....see his childhood and how he grew up.... there are many funny scenes and even hilarious moments that had me in tears. The music is just perfect and takes you into each moment of his thoughts. The way the movie is filmed is amazing.... especially the ending when he goes outside with the girl. I won't spoil it... :o) Not sure how the English do it but they have a way of making low budget movies that you can really connect with and enjoy. The Full Monty, Billy Elliot, Millions, Calender Girls - just to name a few. I highly recommend this film."
5,Worth your time,The Amazon.com review above is very good. My wife and I enjoyed this film very much. We finished the film smiling. And later I wonder why Hollywood fails so completely at making this sorts of fun non-cynical films that aren't for idiots in the midwest with Chuck Norris posters on their bedroom walls? My guess it that the decision in a conscious one by the Hollywood MBAs because we Americans flock in great numbers to the most mind numbing entertainment possible.
4,Imaginative,"I haven't seen a film that has touched my creative nerve in quite some time. Very well written and filmed. Hilariously funny with a charming cast of characters, Cash Back is also extremely witty and clever. Buy this film and watch it again and again."
4,Artistic License,"Most viewers of this movie are more voyeurs than viewers.This movie has a deep artistic quality of a passionate individual,struggling to find his calling."
2,Eye Candy As Lure,"Ill be honest.. the beautiful girl on the title page is what initially got me interested in the movie. I read the bio and the movie seemed cool enough.Gave up on it about 30-40 mins in, had to shut it down. The movie is really slow but surprisingly well done for an independent."
4,Artist Studies T & A to Find The Face of Love,"Excellent DVD. There is a short version and a full-length version on the DVD. At the far end of the full-length version there is a story to tell and it has a Chick-Flick Happy Ending, which you don't see coming at all with the short version. It is challenging to watch them one after the other, especially with company, but the short version is handy when you want to view the art and the comedy and don't want to play with the remote to avoid more dramatic and inspiring scenarios."
2,cashback,"This film is very dull and not what I thought it would be. Very poor acting, and the story line was something that a 12 year old child would write. Just about the time that you would think that things would make sense, then it would fade off into nonsense. The only good thing about this film is the gorgeous girl on the cover of the container."
4,Quriky and artsy,"This British short film handles the subject of dead-end jobs, the truth about relationships, and the beauty of the human form with taste and humor. An extended version of a short film, the movie never feels dull or dragging, which is an accomplishment in and of itself."
1,"awful ..received wrong product,,no response from seller...","very displeasedi with this vendor,, received entirely difffrent product from that i orderderedhave contacted seller twice regarding error with no response,would not reccomend this vendor for any purchase,,"
5,mucho mejor de lo espectado,este es un gran album. lo que Andrés logra en vivo con los músicos que trae es digno de escucharse y además admirar;.Gracias Andrés por las alegrías que nos das y la enseñanza que traspasas.
3,Good fit but a bit delicate,"Used these when wiring my garage. They fit well and look nice, but they crack easily when putting in the screws. One has to be very careful not to tighten the screws too much."
4,Helpful snapshot of Haiti,"This book is helping me to understand the situation of Haiti in historical context. Its information, format and pictures strike me as slightly out of date but it certainly will give you a background even if not covering the last few years. Since there aren't a lot of books like this one about Haiti I would recommend this for anyone who wants to know more about it but does not want to read a long in-depth tome."
4,Interesting alternative,"Interesting alternative to the current economic system. The book ""After Capitalism"" is not a technical book, but does flesh out enough of the economic system invisioned by Schweickart to make it worth reading and thinking about. Is there ""no alternative"" to capitalism? I am still not sure, but read this book and find out for your self. According to Mises, socialism cannot work, and this really must be the case with Schweikart, but I am not sure I could articulate a proof.Also read ""The Machinery of Freedom"" by David Freidman, for another alternative: the real free market."
3,Ships mentioned in this book are listed at ShipIndex.org,"Note to researchers: The vessels mentioned in this book's index are included in the freely-accessible online database at[...]. Use that site to explore more than 100,000 ship references from this and dozens of other books, journals, databases, and more."
2,How very odd,"This book is an odd blend of Yoga, American Indian Spirituality, and Eastern Mysticism mixed together with the author's own imaginings about what the Craft is all about. My personal opinion is that this book is more about mutated witchcraft than it is about ""evolutionary"" witchcraft.If you're into New Age mix & match materials passed off as witchcraft, then this is the book for you!"
2,"Blender Wicca a ""Tradition""?","If you take all the popular ""advanced"" and not so advanced books on wicca/witchcraft that are the current fad, you get yet another ""tradition"". This is one of those blender ""traditions"" - a mix of some of this and some of that. The photos of the tatooed dancer is something you don't see in any other ""advanced"" books (you do see it on all high school campuses, reality TV, etc. - so much for originality). Almost everything that is presented in this ""tome"" has been around for many years. Read Starhawk's ""Spiral Dance"" for a start. The writing is repetitive to the point of being annoying. I was very disappointed because I ordered this based on all the rave reviews. I'd suggest you check this out at a library to see if it's for you, before you order it.The one I ordered is on it's way back to Amazon."
3,Amazon's description is wrong.,"I already had this album on CD, bought it specifically because Amazon's product description states ""entire album in 5.1 surround"". Guess I should have read the reviews first."
2,shameful limits on such previously wonderful wings,"if you have followed Mudvayne through their career, you would most likely remember the complexity of their music: the time signatures, syncopations, melodies and vocal arrangements. Watching them live would only reaffirm how technical and caring they were about their songs. However, with this new album, it sounds like producers put chains on their limbs and gave them songbooks. The compexity is pretty much eliminated, save for a single track, IMN. That's a shame because some of my favorite work was from the intricate bass and drum lines in previous albums. The lyrics feel too commercial compared to the depth Chaz reached in prior albums, and that plastic feel really contaminates the whole album. It's a shame to see them go early, since this was one of my absolute favorite bands."
4,In what way is this nu metal?,"i do like a couple bands considered nu metal, ill admit that, but mudvayne ISNT nu metal. they are pure metal with their own special twist. this cd is great i think i reviewed the regular version back when it was released, and i definitely recommend it to any metalhead."
3,This Dual Disc Lacks Anything Worth While.,"It's no secret, the album is good.Lets talk Dual Disc features.Here's my overal take on this dual disc. CRAP!!!No 5.1 audio. I specifically bought this album cause I believed it had multichannel audio. I was wrong. 2 channel only. What CRAP! I'd return it if I could. Yea sure, its got a 15 minute video collage, thats crap also. If studio's dont embrace an amazing feature such as 5.1 audio then they can keep loosing potential money from me. Way to keep milking a dying product Sony! - It's the last f'in dollar you will trick me out of. If I want basic 2 channel audio, Ill stick to P2P."
4,A little mainstream there...,"The album itself is great, no doubt there, but the problem I have with it - Mudvayne had lost it's distinctive sound with it. I'm sure you've heard ""Happy?"" on the radio already, along with that songs ""Fall Into Sleep"" and ""TV Radio"" will probably soon hit the charts. My other problem with this is the dual disc format. It would be so much better to get a separate CD and DVD, but oh well...I don't know why Mudvayne became more radio-friendly, but that's not a direction I'd want the band to go into... Bring back the L.D.50 times..."
5,GREAT CD,This Album is really good i love this band and they are truely great. this cd is aggressive and impossible for a metal fan to walk away from. their cds have gotten softer but it dosent mean it is bad does it??? This is truely a must have cd for every rock and mudvayne fan.
5,Extremely thought-provoking.,"Humans share 96% of DNA with Chimps. It's eerie how much humanity is obvious in the chimps. Have we really come that far from chimphood? Perhaps not. The sound track is somewhat anthropomorphic, but you can turn the sound off and the pictures speak for themselves. They are extremely social, they use tools, they laugh, they play, they hunt, they posture and bluff. They don't quite use language, but it's awfully close. Makes me want to chow down on some yummy termites!"
3,OK Book,Welcome ParadiseThis was a very light book that was easy to read and funny. It was nice to read about Key West.
4,A Key West Vacation - For The Price of a Novel,"With a friendly and intuitive writing style, Laurence Shames takes his readers and deliveries them to a paradise vacation. Like most vacations, this trip isn't about the destination - it's about life's journey. Fate and mistaken identity, lead our main character through a gauntlet of unpleasant experiences. Key West is a great place to do some soul searching. In this novel, the drama of comedy/tragedy, humility & humiliation are crashed into more than Florida Key, Deer. My only regrets, are that this vacation lasts less than 250 pages & that our beloved author writes only one book per year (perhaps a trip to the midwest, would improve Mr. Shame's work ethic)."
5,"Misfits, Misadventures and Mistaken Identity in Paradise!","Mobster Al Marracotta and furniture salesman Alan Tuschman have about as much in common as a bowl of spaghetti and a bowl of conch chowder. They do, however, have the same nickname (BIG AL) and it just so happens that both of them are driving to Key West at the same time! A pair of south Florida wise guys are hired to make Big Al Marracotta's vacation in Key West miserable, but in a case of mistaken vanity plates, they start picking on the wrong Big Al! Using dead squid, live lobsters, and a remote control shark, ""Chop"" and ""Squid"" make Alan Tuschman wish he'd never left home!It's another Key West caper by Laurence Shames full of quirky characters, non-stop laughs, and a clever unexpected ending. The only disappointment was ""Bert the Shirt"" didn't make a cameo appearance. Oh well, there's always the next book!"
3,Worth watching but not great...,"Maybe the other reviewers are right about the historical significance of ""The Desperadoes,"" but I'm in it for the entertainment and this film was only three-stars-worth. Except it was fun seeing Glenn Ford so VERY young and I could watch Randolph Scott jumping off his horse at the well over and over and not get at all bored. When men were men and all that jazz..."
1,Da King of the NBA:but not happening on the Mic,"While Shaq is the Baddest Baller in the NBA with Kobe almost there,on the Mic Shaq leaves alot to be desired here but ""strait Playin"" is a tight Jam.Production&Side Guests like Biggie,Quik,etc... make this Set more happening than the Big Fellow.Shaq Rocks on the Court&His Book&Commentarys are Cool but not on the Mic or on the Big Screen."
3,Another underated Shaq CD.,"Best Songs:Still Can't Stop the Reign ****1/4 w/ Biggie SmallsLegal Money **** w/ ProdigyStrait Playin' ***1/4 w/ Nate DoggEdge of Night *** (Phil Collins beat)Overall CD effort by Shaq ****Overall Song Quality ***Shaq does it again with another CD. This time around he has even bigger appearances from Rap Stars. He must have paid top dollar, because this time around he gathers Nate Dogg, Jay Z and even Biggie! The beats are even tighter aswell, not one single bad beat on the entire cd. Some of the beats are obviously borrowed (credit is given in the insert) but makes the raps sound even better. This is by far Shaq's best to date, edging out Shaq-Fu: Da return.I would have to give this CD four stars just because of the quality beats and guests. Usually guests are overplayed, but in Shaq's case they helped out his quality alot.I would have given this CD 3 1/2 stars, and It's better then Shaq Fu: Dar Return, but since theres no option for 3 1/2 I went with 3 stars."
4,"""You Can't Stop the Reign"" brings back bittersweet memories..","Of the great loss to the hip hop world of Christopher Wallace AKA ""The Notorious B.I.G"", who collaborated with Shaquille O'Neal on the title cut. Hip hop music has regressed in the eleven years since the release of ""You Can't Stop the Reign"", having lost much of its energy and originality.I miss the lightheartedness and euphoric feelings evoked from the hip hop sounds from the late 80's to mid 90's. It is a wonderful thing to have the old school sounds available in the market. Sounds to remind us of the richness and raw energy from a time gone by and perhaps one day, hip hop will go through a rebirth and restore the cool and the flavor lost in the current recipe of sameness and lame lyrics saturating the radiowaves today."
1,Shaq,"Oh my god this is horrible. This is some of the worst ""music"" I've heard in quite a long time. Please just go away."
4,One of the best Non Cussing cd's I ever heard,"This had to be one of the best non cussing cds I have ever heard. Plus it had more legendary Rapppers on this cd all it was missin was snoop and 2 pac (even though he was dead when this album was released). But it had all an idea of an gangsta rap album, but with no cussin or killin. It was mainly talking about gettin that Legal money. Plus shaq wasnt half bad as an rapper on this cd he worked his ass off on this one. I think it was another legandary album slept on because he is a hooper. but with tracks such as ""Legal Money"" ""You caint stop the regin"" and ""straight Playin"" showed that shaq tried to make a legandary album it worked, but slept on."
3,"Video & Songs great, Audio on VHS static and noise","Video and songs are great, but audio on VHS was really bad!! Had to shut off VCR stereo and just play MONO to get rid of static and noise. Tried it on 5 VCRs- same problem. Only solution seems for us to wait for a DVD digital remaster. Any word when that will be available?"
4,I like it,Not enough Bill Champlin but still a great concert would love a DVD version though.I assume that new song 'The Pull' is from that album the record company didn't like and wouldn't release.I wonder why Chicago dont release it now cause that song and the others that are on the boxed set are really good.Anyway this is a ripper add it your collection of this great band in concert
3,Careful with AFCI circuits,"Product is generally good and does what it's supposed to, and the fact that it looks like a regular light switch makes it visually appealing. However, be careful when using these on newer construction, which requires AFCI circuit breakers in bedrooms by code - AFCI breakers can only take up to 1000W of dim-able load per breaker. This means that if you have two of these 600W dimmers on a single AFCI circuit, if you turn on both sets of dimmed lights, the breaker will trip every time."
1,Shot on video juvenile cap,"AQUANOIDS sounds good, but it is just a cheaply made shot on video amateur movie. The acting is bad, the monster is bad and the showdown is a laugh. Actually, it is just a shameful rip off of the much more entertaining Roger Corman production HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP. If you are interested in fish monsters, stay with the Corman movie."
5,2003 Acura TL - More low end power,"I got this in hopes of getting better gas milage. I cant really tell a lot of difference. The car accelerates easier. Using Lucas Gas Treatment does make your car get better milage tho. I would reccomend this filter because it can be used 50,000 miles before cleaning."
5,K&N Filter,"By far, hands down, the best air filter money can buy. I wouldn't consider running my vehicles with anything other than K&N."
5,excellent!,"i love this air filter knowing that i won't have to replace it ever again, and its backed by a million mile warranty! it does add some power to my 1998 honda accord but although its not something i can accuratly tell. i would recommend this air filter to anyone!"
1,parabens,It has parabens in it. It did okay as far as dandruff goes. I think head and shoulders is better and doesn't have parabens in it.
3,Helps with dandruff but....,This does help with my dry itchy scalp but it drys my hair out so much I can't even brush through my hair. When I use this I rub the shampoo into my scalp and then use my good shampoo in my hair.
1,Rather Drying,"I have tried several dandruff shampoos over the course of many years and so I am always skeptical about trying the ""next new thing"". The reviews that I read on this product before purchasing it were all relatively positive. However, I foud with my own personal experience that although it works on the scalp it leaves my hair dry and feeling straw like.I used it a total of three times and tried to add different variations of hydrating my hair and scalp after using this shampoo and still nothing work except discontinuing use. I have switched to using a product called Clear along with a deep conditioner and pure coconut on my scalp as daily hydration maintenance."
2,kenra dandruff shampoo,this seems far stronger than the one i tried from the salon. this made my dandruff worse. it dried out my scalp.
5,Great product,Really good product I just started using it but I have heard nothing but good things and it makes my hair look really good
1,Don't do it!!,While I thought this would be a great addition to a newly renovated laundry room I never got a chance to install it! First one arrived damaged and while a second one arrived in about a week the second one came damaged as well. This is a very heavy unit and the packing material used in shipping is not sufficient enough. Unless they change the shipping method I believe this will continue to happen. Not a good experience!!!
1,Fear dot com...,"I was so dissapointed after watching this big mess and I was looking forward to seeing this because I loved Willam Malone's last film,House On Haunted Hill.I thought Fear dot com would be gorier and freaker then HOHH,but boy,was I really dissapointed.Halfway through the film,I keep wondering when are they gonna diliver the blood and gory and it never came.Don't enter Fear dot com,you'll regret it.Watch House On Haunted Hill instead."
1,Udo Kier,The only reason I sat through this mess to the end was to see if the guy who gets hit by the train at the beginning was Udo Kier. It owes me a star.
2,fear dot com.com,"i had high expectations for this movie. The suspense isnt what i thoght it would be, and alot of charactors in the story mean nothing. the objects in the movie that are symbolic dont mean anything to the story. But it wasnt as good as i thought, so dont waste your time."
1,Waste-O-Time.Com,"The fact that I wasted an hour & 1/2 of my life on watching this movie makes me more angry than the bad acting and predictable screenplay. It follows to close to the movie ""The Ring"" which was actually worth watching! This movie is horrible...."
4,"Visually, the Best Movie of the Year","Director William Malone has a horrifying visual style all his own which he has established with Fear Dot Com and House on Haunted Hill. Actually, it would not be inaccurate to compare what he has done so far with David Fincher because the two directors have such an awesome, singular style all their own. What is unfortunate is that while Fincher was doing modern classics like Fight Club and Se7en, Malone was doing guilty pleasure B-movies. Not to knock either of Malone's movies, both were sufficiently creepy and entertaining, but they will not be remembered a decade from now by anyone but die-hard horror fans."
1,Get The Ring Instead,"Wow, so Feardotcom is a terrible movie. It's like, ""Hi- I wanna be The Ring. But I have an awful and poorly executed plot, shot too dark to be scary and my otherwise talented actors are not believable due to poor story choices."" God, it was bad. The one highlight in this non-scary horror movie? Stephen Dorf. You may remember him as Deacon Frost from Blade.HOT.Of course... he didn't have the teeth in this one... dissapointing..."
1,cheap ring rip off,"I still can't believe that a high-calibre actor such as stephen ""space truckers"" dorff would have their names attached to such a film. It makes no sense! That's it! it just makes no sense and is mind-numbingly boring! It is suspiciously similar to the ring too. the worst movie i've seen since... well i hate this picture and now i hate stephen dorff! but i hope he doesn't read this cuz id feel baddish"
1,This Won't Even Please Stephen Dorff Fans!,"First of all I wanted to give it zero stars, but it wasn't allowed. Being a big Stephen Dorff fan, I know his reputation for less than excellent movies. Still I manage to watch his films though I know I will end up regretting the action. FearDotCom is one of those times. It was the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The scenery was dark. The plot was predictable. The acting was horrid and the only thing scary was the fact that a studio backed this mess. If Stephen Dorff keeps going for films like this, people will soon be saying "" Stephen who? "". This won't even please a Stephen Dorff fan. If you went to see it in the movies, I feel sorry for you. If you haven't, BEWARE and don't waste your time buying it! If you must see it wait until it comes out on cable. Other than that thank your lucky stars you haven't had to watch it."
1,"Directionless, Storyless","Dreadful. The producers should have to pay everyone who watched this movie. The movie is storyless and has no character development. The only good part is when its over. Not in the least bit scary either, a good movie to cure insomniacs."
1,"Lord have mercy, stay away from this mess!","This film must take place in an alternate universe where black outs occur. The only lights visible in the movie are equiped with 10 watt bulbs...understandable since a city the size of fake-opolis would require too many generators to actually power decent lighting. If this movie had half the plot and acting of a movie like ""Seven"" where it ran mostly in the dark you might be able to dismiss the lighting issues in this movie(where jail cells are lit with one flourescent tube). Unfortunately the acting and story line seem to start off in mediocrity and plunge from there. Finally, i'd like to take the star i gave this movie back...it does not deserve it."
1,Dull.dotcom,"I wish there really was a website such as the one depicted in this movie. Why? Because if it were available at the time I viewed this movie, I would have rather logged in and suffered my doom rather than have to sit through this film again. I am a big fan of horror films, even bad horror films. The only thing that pleased me about this film was when it finally ended and I didn't have to suffer through it anymore."
2,Fear for the dying film industry. com,"I will not waste my time typing a full review on this absolute trash. This is not a horror/thriller film it has brought about its own genre, that being TRASH. If I could give it zero stars I would.I could not bear to read the girl Kelly's entire review. When I saw the reference to The Shining and Alfred Hitchcock I began feeling sick for our entire human existence. She must have be one of the films actors. And I use that term very loosely.Bottom Line: Just leave it alone it is not worth the pain of trying to get through. I wish I had the money these studios have to just throw away on trash like this. This film today exemplifies the lack of talented writers in Hollywood."
1,online XXX rated material,"The triple X is a warning for material that can bore you to death. I watched the first 55 minutes of this movie, and then stoped watching it. It wasn't worth watching it to the end. That is how boreing it is."
2,Hannibal Lecter versus Samara Morgan.,"Ok, it's a rehash. The script is just a bad version of ""The Ring meets Silence of the Lambs"", with some ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" sceneries. It's a mess and a shame. Only gave 2 stars cause the visuals are nice."
2,A beautifully crafted mess,"N.Y. Cop Dorff teams with Health Inspector McElhone to investigate a website that kills people with their greatest fear, forty-eight hours after they log on. This is losely related to a snuff cam villian (Rea) who tortures and kills young girls. Director Malone follows an exact pattern of Italian horror filmmaker Dario Argento; dark, well crafted, highly stylised and visually stunning but the story is completely incoherent and the voilence grotesque and unappealing. Extra points for Christian Sebalt's photography and Nicholas Pikes music score."
1,"Horrible Rip-off of ""The Ring""","This movie is very similar to ""The Ring"" except it's a website that kills you instead of a video. Ok, I'll admitt this has some creepy scenes, but yet it was very corny in parts. And who can forget the line ""Come find me...you have 48 hours."" Gimme a break. Get ""The Ring"" as oppsoed to this."
1,Very Bad,"This Movie Is not even worth your 4 dollars at a movie rental store, The spose thriller doesnt even come close to the movie it copyed off of , ""The Ring"", My Advice to you DO NOT watch this movie, Waste of time."
1,"cheap imitation of ""The Ring""","This movie tried really hard to copy The Ring script-line, except it's tottally unscary and stupid. Oh, another person dying, and it really matters because we CARE about the characters, not. The only redeeming quality is that you get to see a few boobies. Skip this film and get The Ring instead."
3,2.5 stars,"Not scary, but I've seen far worse horror flick than this. Ever heard of Scream, or Silence of the Lambs, those stunk. This isn't scary, but it could of been. It was just poorly executed. See The Ring instead, if you want true scares!"
1,"where's the ""no stars"" rating?","I love a good horror film. When I saw this one I knew a classic had been born. Not of horror, though. A classic in that for the first time ever assembled in one place are all the things a producer doesn't want to do with a film. The non-existent story develops into something so inane and not scary that I briefly contemplated suing them for the minutes of my life that were wasted. Why don't some of these vendors offer to pay us to take this movie! As I think of this movie saying that it sucks offers too high of a praise."
2,"Could've easily been the next ""SEVEN""...","...but the problem is that it tries way too hard to do exactly that. Stephen Dorff tries hard to be Brad Pitt throughout the entire film and Rea tries to be Kevin Spacey aka ""John Doe"" throughout. It just doesn't work. I do like the whole ""if you visit this site, you die"" concept, and the innitial premise sounded rather interesting, but in the end, it plops. If you still intend to see this movie, just don't expect that much from it."
2,At least it had a good concept...,"Really the concept of this movie is pretty good. Unfortunatly the list of good things about this movie ends there. Most of the movie is extremely hard to see or comprehend. While there is a little bit of entertainment value (I did watch the whole thing because I wanted to see what happened at the end) this movie is not really worth paying for, I watched it on a movie channel. If you do see this movie it's one of those movies that you only want to see once and at the end it kind of leaves you saying ""huh?"""
3,Not bad; interesting concept,"I watched this movie late one night and was rather intrigued by the concept. It's not a great movie, but I don't think it's a bad movie either. It's certainly worth watching at least once. I thought the movie was well cast but the story/script was choppy. That was, perhaps, it's biggest problem. Yes, many things could have been better explained throughout the film. Some of the visualizations were overdone. I'm not generally a fan of horror movies, but I did find this one interesting, intriguing, and worth watching. Give it a try -- you might be surprised and like it."
2,Cast and Production Values Deserve Better,"I liked this movie the first time I saw it...when it was called THE RING.(In fact, you'd have to see THE RING to understand what in the world's going on in this movie. The whole finding-the-body-will-lift-the-curse thing. It's too bad. The cast deserved better)."
3,eh ripping off horror cult-ure can be fun!,fear dot com in my eyes had alot of potential....if they hadnt ripped the ring soo much it coulda been much much better....also i noticed that it also reminded me alot of the Silent Hill series...people who have played the game would know what i mean...but overall it wasnt a horrible movie ... ripoffs aside its the type of movie u can watch with your friends with the lights off an u can make jokes about it an scare the girls (hehehe) i thought it was a fun horror film
2,Comparing this to The Ring is an insult to The Ring,"About the only thing this movie has going for it is the visuals. So if you're a fan of scary imagery, then this one's worth a look. But if you're expecting a plot, too, buy The Ring instead."
1,Rip off,"Fear.com is a rip off of The Ring, no more and no less. Doom comes by going to the Fear.com website instead of watching a video but the basic plot is the same. Instead of being a reporter the heroine works for the health department. Instead of a video technician her love interest is a cop. In this, a serial killer essentially creates snuff films while internet viewers watch. Now anyone who goes to the site is doomed to die in 48 hours. Why? For exactly the same reason that was given in The Ring. The heroine in Fear.com goes on a trip, visits the ghostly victim's home and finds the body in water, just like in The Ring. The heroine gets a nose bleed just like Rachel does in The Ring. The endings are also essentialy the same.The big difference is that Ring was scary and had atmosphere. Fear.com is just gross and sloppy. It's like comparing cheese flavored cracker spread to a hunk of Cheddar. Save your cash. This flick is just plain bad."
1,Horrible.,Absolutely horrible. Boring/confusing and could only watch about 30 minutes of it.. 30 minutes that were very forced.
1,"No Fear, No Scares,No need to watch",This movie sucks. There was nothing any good about it at all. I cant belive i even made it through the whole movie. Not any good for any collection.
3,"Doesn't live up to its potential, but has a few good parts","A premise of a website that can absorb psychic energy and project it back out of your computer is ripe with potential but falls short in it's execution. Using a similar plotline to The Ring but using a website instead of a video tape, Fear-Dot-Com does not have the suspense or the mystery that The Ring had.The most notable fault is the editing, jerking from one scene to the next without proper flow, and the speed-shot flashes are too fast and too disjointed to have any impact on the viewer. There is too much repetition in initial visits to the website, doing nothing more than adding painful minutes to this movie as padding. The torturer-doctor is more cheesy than creepy, some of the acting is poor, and it definitely takes too long to get going.However, the ending has a surprise for you, and quite a lovely, brutal, karma-like ""what goes around come around"" visual that will make up for some of your lost time in the beginning. Enjoy!"
1,Ugly movie!!!,"This producers can't do something better than this???I just lost my money in this movie...let me tell you that people and critics told me that this film was bad but i was very corious with the film so i decided to rent it!!!It's an awfull copy of the ring but this time you die 2 days later after enter in a web site www.feardotcom.com4 bodies are founded and a policeman and a doctor something like that i don't remember are discovering the mistery but to discover it they probably have to enter in the siteA regular idea but an awfull screenplay all is bad, bad acting, bad direction, bad deaths, etcDont rent it or buy it a very bad movie!!!"
4,Fear Dot Com verses The Ring,"If any of you rocket scientist would take the time to think about both the ring and fear dot com, you would realise fear dot com is not copying the ring at all. In fact fear dot com was released before the ring was, meaning if anything was copying anything, the ring would be a copy of fear dot com. Dont get me wrong i think the ring is a exceptionally great movie, i would give fear dot com 4 stars. Stephen Dorff was great as always, and the whole plot is rather creative. Some parts of the movie are very very similar to the ring, i would give both movies 4 stars.."
2,havent seen it but heres why,any movie that the producers refuse to let critics review PRIOR to its release can only mean 1 thing.its garbage!just like halloween 21.that wasnt previewed either and that junk i did go see.i gave that 1 star reluctantly(zero would have been too many!).i gave this 2 stars for originality(i guess).ill wait for this to show up for rent and watch to see if my rating was correct.i bet ill need to reduce it by 2 stars.
3,late in arrival,The movie itself had a decent storyline. And some of the effects were horrible. The movie would have done alot better if release as is about 5 to 10 years ago.
2,mess dot com,"This film has a promising eerie start but the plot which borrows from "" The Ring"" and David Cronenberg's classic ""Videodrome"" make no sense. Visually the movie looks great and there is one disturbing scene with some nasty bugs that will make you cringe. But the serial killing doctor is embarrassing- too bad they cut out the mush room factory sequence which is part of the DVD extras."
1,"""Fear Dot Com"" is an Error","What was this movie about? ""Fear Dot Com"" didn't make any sense to me except that it was lame. People log on to the site and then they die 48 hours later of their biggest fear. Originality (no). A detective (Stephen Dorff) and a health investigator (Natascha McElhone) are zombies walking into the same trap as all of the other victims. If stupidity were a crime, these two would be charged with ten counts. Like duh, I'm going to log on to the site and see if I go next! Yes! No! By the way, there's a strange subplot involving a serial killer which is kind of disturbing. If you want to see something scary, rent ""Bride of Chucky"" or ""Jason X."""
1,Absolutely terrible,"Feardotcom is without doubt the worst horror movie I have ever seen. Bad acting, bad direction and an astoundingly awful script render this film unwatchable. The ""plot"" is some generic claptrap about a spooky, creepy, evil website that kills the people who view it. Yes, it is as bad as it sounds. Stephen Rea is completely wasted in this clunker, his role is so bad I find it really hard to believe that he even accepted it. In closing, avoid Feardotcom at all costs. I was kicking myself for even renting it."
1,"stupid, stupid, stupid","if you want to watch this, rent it, don't buy it. not scary AT ALL- if anything, the parts that were supposed to be scary were at best boring, at worst laughable. it's hard to develop any sort of emotion for the characters at all. it's a shoddy [copy] of ringu/the ring- go buy one of those if you want to see a good movie."
1,Watching this is a waste of time,"This movie is so boring and so stupid. You log onto a website and have 48 hours to live, then you die of your depest fear. That's because a hemopheliac was tortured and bled to death by 'the Doctor'. Yeah yeah yeah. The scenes that were supposed to be scary were not, half the movie made no sense, and the movie's ""big finish"" was a real anti-climatic let down. I will never watch this again, and I wish I had the two bucks back that I spent to rent it. Horrible, awful movie."
2,Logon and Play with Death...,"The bodies of four individuals are found and they all have similar symptoms, blood running from their eyes. This is a mystery to the Health Department and the Police Department, who have put their best resources on the job--Terry Huston (Natascha McElhone) from the Health Department and Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff) from the Police Department. As they recover some evidence from hard drives, it seems like they all have been on a website 48 hours before their death. Feardotcom is a horror story that does not set the audience in the fright it intends to as a result from from stiff acting, a rough draft script, and excessive directing that creates a fabricated atmosphere."
2,Yawn,"Like the above Amazon review states, Fear dot com is a total mess. Director William Malone throws away such things as character development and sensible storytelling to go for pure visceral thrills and shocks; something that worked in his 1999 remake of House on Haunted Hill, but it doesn't work it all here. The talents of Stephen Dorff and Natasha McElhone are wasted here as neither's character is allowed to develop, thus both actors give lacking performances. The story revolves around an internet site visited by four people, all of which died 48 hours after visiting the site. The screenplay is loaded with plot holes and contrievances, hardly explaining anything of the going's on. Genre stalwarts Udo Kier and Jeffrey ""Re-Animator"" Combs are on board in minor roles, while Stephen Rea manages to inject some life into this otherwise dismal horror pic with his maniacal performance. All in all, Fear dot com is worth a look for horror afficiondos, just don't expect much."
1,this WAS HORRIBLE,"the concept of this movie was intriguing and it caught my attention and i wanted to see it for awhile , well i just bought it last week ( which was a big mistake) cause its one of the worst films i ever saw.its the most stupid non scary ((horror)) movie ever , let me leave it at that , just dont rent or buy this movie - youll regret it."
1,A Must Miss,"FEAR DOT COM tries so hard that it is embarassing. The script to this quasi-thriller is pedestrian at best, predictable, and just plain awful at worst. There is little point to the story and even that little idea - that connecting a lot of computers together can result in communal energy that creates sick, deadly consequences - is trampled to death (pardon the pun). It never ceases to amaze me how actors of the caliber of Stephen Rea can log on to duds like this. The only reason to rent this film is to see how low some backers will stoop in the name of film making. This is a ""must miss""."
2,Starts off good...falls apart quick,"Not a big fan of this kind of thing (torture porn) but I thought this started off pretty interesting. The characters were interesting and the acting was pretty good, so it kept me watching. The problem is...what the hell is it? If it just stuck to the story of the guy killing girls on a website and the police trying to catch him they may have had something. But all this rubbish about the website having evil powers and one particular girl living in the computer - you lost me. It goes on way too long and too much of the time I just couldn't figure out what was going on. Thumbs down. Waste of talented actors."
2,Grudge offshoot?,"If you have watched the ""Ring"" and ""Grudge"" series you might notice close similarities to this movie. But instead of dying in one week you die in 48 hours. In both the ""Ring"" and [...] a person dies of fear and the cause of the 'curse' in a young child. A lot of movies of this ilk attempt to push the idea that there is a similarity between electronic circuitry and the human brain. A fun concept to toy with but hardly mind boggling. Still worth seeing if you like this sort of thing."
2,Definitely a renter,"I can't imagine the disappointment of those who saw this in the theaters. The movie leaves you with nothing but unanswered questions. How does this ghost person know your name when you log onto the site? Why do people who log onto the site die within 48 hours? Who started the site and how is it related to the mad doctor guy? The movie has a few chilling moments, but for the most part it's a mess."
1,WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS 0 STARS,"This movie is so [bad]. First off a somewhat cool idea on the internet being a theme in a horror movie ,but awful execution. This movie is slow paced and downright boring. The movie reminds of One Hour Photo meets Strangeland(yes its that bad)Terrible acting except the woman forensic does ok. Finally this movie has the worst ending in history,and the villian is as dumb as dr. giggles. Furthermore if you think this will shock with gore or anything,it won't its as tame as watching CSI or ER. AVOID THIS DVD,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED(if you don't trust my judgement just look at all the other negative reviews posted)"
1,This movie is so DUMB!,"If you're looking for a horror film to revitalize the genre, keep looking. This isn't worth your time. Cool visuals don't make a horror movie. See The Ring instead."
1,Simply unwatchable,"I think director William Malone should be forbidden to ever direct again, and all the actors involved should hav etheir licenses to work retired from them.Of course I'm joking, I want no harm to the people responsible for this utterly mess, one of the worst terror flicks ever. Half way through it I could care less about it, but with sheer willpower I managed to finish it. A decent promise (for the terror genre, anyway) was simply wasted in a manner seldom witnessed. The film is unwatchable: dark, dark and more dark, awful edition, bad dialogue, well, enough..."
5,what's that I taste? FEAR!,Brillaint plotsick doctor and a sick plotgreat actingbrilliant endingsad at timesshockingdisturbingpowerful as horror movies can comethis one makes you really wonder if there really are sites like that out therecuz if there are hopefully no one would get off to watching that kind of behavior. that's disgusting. I like the movie cuz it goes to show that evil does not get away empty handed. I have this on dvd. and love it. a powerful yet twisted horror classic.
2,Misleading......,"I bought what I thought looked like a great horror movie. Wrong! Fear Dot Com was a huge let down. The only thing good about this movie is Stephen Dorff and some bloody violence. Otherwise, this movie is no where as good as it leads you to believe. People visit a ""killer"" of a website and then don't live to talk about it. A mad man has created a live-cam website that determines a person's worst fear and brings that fear to life 48 hours later. A detective ( played by Dorff ) is determined to find the source of the website and shut it down before more people die. It seems this would be a good suspenseful horror film but it is not. It's rather boring and doesn't live up to it's expectations!!"
1,The stupidity hurts my head.,"This movie is the worst horror movie I've ever seen, and perhaps the worst movie in general. This is sad, considering I watch mainly horror movies. I really couldn't stand this movie. It jumps around, eludes to a few ""scary"" things here and there, and just doesn't make much sense overall. Sure, there are one or two scenes where I thought ""hmmm, that was a little scary,"" but other than that, it lost my interest. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Should have popped w/ the .com bust.,"Like some illegitimate child of the Ring, Seven, and Nightmare on Elm Street, this movie might have had a chance if it would have been released prior to Ringu and the Ring. As it stands, it's derivative, unoriginal, and sloppily acted / paced. The gal from Ronin reacts like a statue and displays almost as much acting ability for the most part of the movie; at least she has a nice facial structure and eyes. The nonsensical plot involves a tortured and eventually killed victim of a sadistic doctor reaching out through the electronic medium of the Internet [Samara goes digital?]. She punishes anyone that watches the snuff-cam set up by the doctor. Eventually everyone gets their comeuppance including the Dr. Unfortunately we can't get back the lost time devoted to watching."
1,More giggles than goosebumps.,"Silly not sinister. Dimly lit scenes do not a horror film make. Sure there are plenty of grisly images designed to make you squirm, but they never really deliver a knock out punch. And why Steven Rea affected that silly voice throught the movie I'll never know. At least now I've discovered my greatest fear...having to watch feardotcom again."
1,Blarg!,"More laughs than ""Troop Beverly Hills!""More chills than ""Fair Game!""Better Special Effects that ""Crocodile Dundee!""This movie is as bad as any bad review tells you it is.I went into this with the best intentions. I really had hopes for it having read a positive review from Roger Ebert. It is an butt-numbing film. The plot is BORING. The acting is really pathetic. It's almost as if it would have been a good horror film but someone tried to make a more artsy film instead, and you end up with no horror, no thrills, no chills, and sadly - not even any drama. ..."
2,Wrong,"Ringu was released before FearDotCom was.The Ring came out afterward.So it's inaccurate to say that Fear Dot Com ripped off of The Ring. Ringu, yes.FearDotCom took its inspiration from Ringu and Kairo, among other, possible.. BETTER.. flicks.This is a rather poor movie. The acting is dry, the plot incomprehensible, and the logic baffling. One of the victims is a woman who is 'afraid of drowning'. How do they know this fear, and why is it that she did not look like she was 'drowning'?At least the visuals are murky and bleak, suitable for the scenario."
2,good concept,"The basic idea behind this intrigued me which is why I was generous enough to give it 2 stars. Hadly a plot at all and one of the worst endings I've seen in a movie in a long time. Good effects, but used in a very cheesy manner.The acting is not very good, the plot doesn't go very far...just read these other reviews. Read AMAZON's review at the front. That'll tell you what you need to know."
1,Unbelievably bad,"Muddled, horribly acted (especially by the wooden Natascha McElhone) and a plot line that's full of holes...that's ""Fear dot com"", which has one of the biggest howlers I've EVER seen in a movie--a female character who is a hemophiliac. Sorry, scriptwriters: women are carriers of the gene which causes hemophilia, but are NEVER hemophiliacs."
2,"Good Idea, Boring Movie","I was actually thinking of giving this movie one star, but the reason I gave it two stars is because I think the idea of the movie was okay. People dying of their greatest fear 48 hours after entering a web site. But that was the only good thing about this movie. Natascha McElhone's acting was ""not good"".Another reason why I gave this movie two stars instead of one is because there are only about two kind-of-scary scenes, but the majority of them are just too boring. I was about halfway done watching the movie when I thought, why am I still watching this? I continued watching it, thinking that the ending would be better, but everything kept on worsening. The ending was confusing, pointless, and not scary at all. When I finished watching this movie, I realized I had just thrown my money away. This is probably the most regretful, shameful, and worthless buy I'd made. So, if you don't want to waste your time watching a bad movie, do not watch this. I'm just warning you."
1,CRAP DOT COM,"If you loved The Ring and you are looking for something similar,do not buy or hire this crap.Bad actors,crap story and plot,I didn't find any quality in this stuff even the FX are not great! So if you are looking for the fear, re-watch The Ring instead of this joke !"
1,0 STARS: This movie is terrible...just terrible.,"""Feardotcom"" is based on a decent enough premise, but the execution of this movie was truly pathetic. The creators of this movie just sloppily threw together a bunch of uneven scenes with no cohesiveness, employed a lousy script and the result is an unimaginative mess of epic proportions with horrendous acting and a total utter joke of a horror movie. This is the kind of movie that gives the horror genre a bad name these days. This movie is utter GARBAGE with a capital ""G"" and is actually one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. It is AWFUL!"
1,Not for me,"There may be folks that will enjoy this movie, but I'm not one of them. I don't mind horror, and in fact enjoy horror. I don't even mind an occasional Jason/Friday the 13th type movie. This is not a slasher movie. It is a flat out torture movie. I like some of the actors in the movie, and it's why I watched as much as I did but I did not watch the entire movie. Too disturbing for me."
1,Complete garbage!,"Probably the only thing that would make this sell is the nudity. Other than that, storyline is completely confusing and stupid. DO NOT GET THIS, you have been warned."
4,Good movie,I bought this movie on VHS when I was a teenager. Haven't watched it since my VHS player stopped working some years ago. I was happy when I found Fear.com on dvd. When I watched it in the past I was scared I was going to die after watching it.... lol. Years later I still have a fear of death after watching it.... lol. It did scare me to go into any web sights off the internet. Thinking something bad will happen to me after. LOL
1,a rip off don't buy this dvd,"This has got to be the worst DVD I have ever tried to watch. The title is misleading. It has nothing to do with ""historic travel US."" Rather this appears to be an unrelated series of industry sponsored 20 - 30 minute films. Maybe there is some value in looking at homes and industry from the 30's, 40's and 50s but we could not watch any of them all the way through; the gag factor overwhelmed us. The production values were horrible. The sound was often not synchronized and most seemed to be a long advertisement. I felt ripped off. I do not know about the rest of the series but after this one, I will never find out."
5,Better & Better,"Like a fine wine, James Taylor just keeps getting better with age. He really puts his unique stamp on some of these Christmas classics and throws in a few that you might not be as familiar with, but will soon not be able to do without. He puts a lot of soul & feeling into everyone of these songs. Definitely an instant classic!!!"
5,A Real Christmas Album,"Some familiar, some not so familiar, all in the iconic voice of JT. It's one of the few Christmas albums that I don't pick and choose the gems and place the rest in a (no) playlist. I keep coming back."
4,Classic JT!,"I am a lifelong fan of JT. This CD is terrific festive Christmas! The reason it is a 4 is because it's a little lacking in any kind of spiritual heartbeat... the real meaning of Christmas. Still, I love JT."
3,Same as older Christmas CD,"I had hoped there was new material on this cd--it is very similar to his older cd, so it was duplicated quite a bit."
1,"Same old, same old...","If you have the original JT Christmas album, realize that there are only a couple new songs on this ""new"" one. I bought it without checking and when I played it the first time, I thought I had put on the old one by mistake. If you don't have the old one, this will be a great addition to your JT collection. I guess after six years I was expecting more new stuff..."
4,JT alla prova con brani natalizi.,"Come sempre JT riesce a produrre qualche cosa di interessante .Ho comprato nello stesso periodo sia quelo pubblicato dalla COLUMBIA che quello della HALLMARK (fuori catalogo) - contengono alcuni pezzi uguali.Comunque, ottime performances."
5,Wonderfully James,James Taylor's music alway creates the proper mood for whatever occasion. He's done it again. Enjoy
5,Christmas with James Taylor,"I have been in love with James Taylor since the late 60's/early 70's and this CD is the icing on the cake. I have never heard his warm voice in more of a pleasant, easy, and totally pleasing venue. His Christmas Song collection is absolutly a must-have for the winter Holidays!! BUY IT NOW!!!"
2,In the Bland Mid - Whimper,"Sorry, folks, I know this will make me unpopular, but this album goes way beyond bland! Sounds as though all involved had a jolly, old, subdued, old time. This includes the wimpiest version of ""In the Bleak Midwinter"" that could ever possibly be recorded. How can you take a tune as magnificent as that and turn it into mush, as they did on this album. If you want to hear a respectable version, one that does the tune justice, listen to the Moody Blues, ""December"" from 2003. I like Christmas music as much as anyone, but not if it is just vaguely warm and fuzzy, devoid of all feeling! sorry, James. I am ready for the ""0 out of 20 found this review helpful"" header!"
5,Treat yourself!,It does not matter whether you celebrate Christmas or not - James Taylor's voice and Dave Grusin's arrangements will make you feel good all year long. You will want to listen to this great addition to Taylor's work over and over.
5,GREAT NEW TWIST!!,"What a fabulous new Christmas CD!! Nice, jazzy, upbeat takes on well known songs. A great piece to play at a Christmas party! I cannot wait to play it at ours.....a fun one to listen to while wrapping presents and sipping cheer around the fire. Pick it up today!"
2,a bit disappointing,"I'm very happy I purchased a second-hand CD of this, for I was not crazy about it. I have been a long-time fan of James Taylor (I mean from when he had a full head of hair.. long time), and am still a huge fan.. his voice is so unique & beautiful. But this was his only CD that I did not like."
2,Disapointed,"I love James Taylor, but he plays around too much on this one and it ends up loosing the atmosphere of Christmas which is why we buy Christmas music, isn't it?"
4,Gorilla in a Santa Hat,"This is essentially the same release as the 2004 ""James Taylor: A Christmas Album,"" which was sold exclusively through Hallmark Stores and online for a limited time. However, this one includes ""River"" and ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,"" which may not have been on the Hallmark disc but WAS a bonus track on limited editions of ""October Road"" in 2002. The track selection is all record company hocus-pocus. The important thing is that this is James Taylor singin' some Christmas favorites, and if that doesn't put you in a more cheerful holiday spirit you're truly an incurable cold-blooded Grinch. It's one of the best holiday releases I've ever heard by anyone, and I've been around since Christmas was invented, I think. This is a can't-go-wrong purchase. Nice album cover shot, too. Nice scarf, JT. Luv yah."
5,Just perfect!,"I can't say enough good about this CD. It is my favorite Christmas CD. James Taylor has the perfect sound, and I especially love listening to him around the holidays. I think anyone of any age would love this. You can't go wrong!"
5,PEACE AND GOODWILL,"WHAT ELSE COULD ONE EXPECT FROM JAMES TAYLOR, SURELY ONE OF THE MOST 'SPIRITUAL' OF SINGERS. NO MATTER WHAT YOUR 'FAITH', HE , AS ALWAYS, TAPS INTO THE ESSENCE OF FAITH....... FOR ALL MANKIND! MAY THIS RECORDING SYMBOLIZE ANEW; OUR HOPE OF 'PEACE ON EARTH AND GOODWILL TOWARD MEN'."
2,remake of 2004 cd,"If you have Taylor's 2004 Christmas CD, don't bother with this one. Ten of the 14 songs are exactly the same. My son got this for me for Christmas. I was excited at first to have a new Taylor album; then totally disappointed when I played it. How do people get away with marketing an album as new when it isn't? It reminds me of drug companies who tweak a patented drug, and then proclaim that it's something brand new - just to make a buck. I'm very disappointed in James."
3,Nice Christmas Tunes,"I am a James Taylor fan from way back, but I have to admit that this album did not wow me. I guess I am burned out by the standards of the season; most arrangements are not particularly original. (Check out the Josh Groban/Brian McKnight version of ""Angels We Have Heard On High"". Just glorious!) I was looking forward to ""In the Bleak Midwinter"", probably my all time favorite non-standard Christmas song. It was unremarkable; I prefer the Julie Andrews version."
4,Another James T. winner,"Nothing better than JT's voice to evoke relaxed, easy listening....Great addition to your Christmas collection."
1,terri1224,"I ordered two CD's at the same time coming from two seperate locations, along with paying for the quick ship delivery charges and I have yet to find the James Taylor CD. Pretty bumbed out about that.8-("
2,Uninspired,A long time James Taylor fan - but there is a certain cheese factor about these arrangements that makes them truly difficult to listen to.Do look elsewhere.
2,too jazzy for JT,"I was expecting mellow and was surprised by how ""jazzy"" it was.I like the more country James Taylor."
3,I was excited about this CD but disappointed,"I was really excited about this CD as I love christmas music and have a large collection of holiday music. However as one reviewer put it ""it's distinctly James Taylor"". The sound is in no way traditional and his voice to my suprise just does not exude anything christmas. I was very disappointed."
2,Not terrible but definitely not good.,"I have nothing specifically against James Taylor but this is one of the most boring albums in existence, Christmas or otherwise.Everything on this album is a complete snooze-fest, Christmas never sounded so depressing!I've also never heard anyone destroy Jingle Bells as bad as this man. It's not a very good song to begin with and he somehow found a way to make it worse.You're better off spending a few extra bucks and gettingMidwinter Gracesby Tori Amos.Midwinter Gracescombines interestingly interpreted and modified originals like What Child/Nowell and Jeanette, Isabella with solid original songs. Most importantly it has varied sounds and well-executed instrumentals that make the monotony of James Taylor at Christmas seem almost criminal."
4,Great product...............timely delivery!,"The product was delivered in a speedy manner, and in great condition!"
5,James Taylor Christmas,"A great CD if you are a James Taylor fan, and even if you're not! Especially the duet with Natalie Cole!"
3,Not the best...,"I had just bought October Road which I totally love, so I thought why not try his Christmas CD. Not so hot! I'd say four or five of the songs are pretty good, but the others are average or less than average. If I had to buy another Christmas CD I think I'd go with Bing or Nate."
2,Not what I expected,"As a long time fan of JT, I was expecting something closer to his style of music. Rather, this collection is JT reaching for a jazzy/bluesy feeling and really, if you want that in a Christmas album, JT wouldn't be your first choice. The lesson I learned is to listen to all the samples and don't assume that any holiday album will sound like previous work."
3,S'Okay,"Every year I buy myself a new Christmas CD. Last year I bought Chris Isaak and this year James Taylor. The only song on JT's Christmas CD that I find myself singing to when the CD is not playing is ""Baby, It's Cold Outside."" Thanks to Natalie Cole, this is the best track on the disk. I was kind of disappointed in this CD, especially after seeing a live performance of JT this past September. His personality on stage is so much better than this effort. My advice to anyone who wants to add another Christmas CD to their collection is buy the Chis Isaak. Even though he is not as famous, he wrote some of the songs on that CD and it has become one of my favorites. And believe me, I know Christmas!"
4,JT Christmas,This is a good one to have on in the background for a Christmas party. How can you go wrong with JT?
3,Should've read the reviews... turns out I have this by Hallmark,"I was disappointed to find that this is essentially the same album I'd bought at Hallmark a few years ago. However, it's great music, so I'll probably give it to someone who likes JT as much as I do."
5,Wonderful album!,My husband and I both are avid James Taylor fans. We love this album and have been playing it repeatedly.
3,James Taylor,Was a little disappointed in this CD. Did not enjoy the arrangement of the selected songs but for the price I won't complain too much.
2,Where is the folk singer I used to love,"I have always loved James Taylor. I found warmth in the folksy sound of his music and his voice. But recently, everything he records seems to have more of a jazz feel, and it sounds like he may have taken voice lessons and his voice is more polished. I miss the old JT style.I was disappointed in this cd."
3,A couple shining stars on an otherwise odd album,"I loved ""Who comes this night"", which was a new song to me, as well as James' arrangements of ""Go tell it on the mountain"" and ""In the bleak midwinter"". The honorary Scot in me also appreciated hearing some of the more obscure verses of the Bobbie Burn's classic, ""Auld Lang Syne"", though I could have done without the tweaking there, particularly the anglicizing of the lyrics.Overall, many of the songs sounded too similar to me and I failed to appreciate the jazz take on many of the tracks. Personal preference as much as anything. As can be seen from other reveiws, others may appreciate these arrangements more than I.All in all, the album is worth its price for the 2nd and 10th trcks alone. Now if only I can find the sheet music for those without having to buy a couple of $20 compilations..."
1,Not what I expect from Amazon,The James Taylor at Christmas CD that I ordered skips and jumps and stutters so badly that I cannot listen to it.
1,Not at his best.,Purchased this as a Christmas present. Disappointing. Not James Taylor at his best.
1,Sweet Baby Jesus Awful,"The stultifying bore applies his well-crafted soul-less hackery to the Christmas canon. Just go and click on that 30-second Jingles Bell clip above and see if you can make it to the end. Fans, however, will love this record."
2,Disappointing,"While the song selection was interesting, the only one that was innovative was ""Jingle Bells"". Many of the other selections were cheesy and annoying, especially ""Baby It's Cold Outside"""
5,The best James yet,"This CD exceeded my expectations. His fresh interpretations of old classics are soft and wonderful! The duet with Natalie Cole adds new charm to ""Baby, It's Cold..."", leading me to hear it in a totally new way after hearing it for many, many years. Strangely enough, his ""In the Bleak Midwinter"" makes me want to slow dance to it, and that puts a new tone on it, to be sure. I just love the whole CD!"
5,Excellent,"Being a JT fan, what could be better than a holiday album from the man himself. Excellent renditions of classics, as well as some original material. Not essential, but if you're a JT fan, nice to have in the collection."
1,"I love James Taylor, but this one stinks.","normally I can purchase anything by James Taylor and I love it... But this cd, waist of money!!!Don't waste your time."
2,Weird,James Taylor's odd renditions of old Christmas favorites was disappointing. I wanted to here his soothing baritone voice bring classic Holiday songs into my home. Instead I got this. The addition of the Beatles Here Comes the Sun doesn't fit well with the other song choices either. I just took most of this record out of my Christmas music mix.
5,Great service,"I received the product as ordered, in the condition promised, and well within the shipping parameters established. That's all I can ask for."
5,James Taylor at Christmas,"As always, Mr Smooth! Another classic CD to be played year after year on Christmas and any other time. A mellow sound with soothing songs of love, family and good times."
3,Review of James Taylor at Christmas,"Good for some quiet, relaxed listening with a Christmas theme. This minstrel can de-stress a person. It's like he's taken the hype and the excess noise out of everything and has left the good stuff for us to listen to."
5,James Taylor Christmas,Typical excellent James taylor music for Christmas! I love any music by this artist and have ever since high school in the 70's.
5,my music,I have a disabled niece who LOVES music and NY cloud drive on Amazon is a wonderful way to store music for her. It's so easy to manage.
5,Boffo!,Gary Mule Deer is one of the originals..Over 40 years in the business..people sometimes think he is doing someone else's material but it turns out he did it first..He is absolutley the best.Just saw him recently in concert with Johnny Mathis and he got a standing ovation in the middle of the Mathis Show..Also saw him recently on the tv show The History Of Country Comedy and on an episoce of Nash Bridges on CBS.
5,"Good, ""clean"" humor geared towards older generations","I heard a bit from this album on Sirius. Some of his one liners and side remarks had me laughing days later. I bought the album and was happy I did. I've listened to it now about 8 times. I don't mind profanity and vulgar comedy, but I am impressed when a comedian can make me laugh without them. Gary is one of the few that can do this. If it helps, think of him as an older Brian Regan with Native-American lineage and country music roots. People in the 50+ age group would appreciate his humor the most, I think. His Native American ""wisdom"", sardonic sense of humor, and random and very brief musical ""interruptions"" are definitely worth a listen."
1,Utterly Terrible,I've been playing D&D for 20 years and ths is the worst module I have ever played. It is utterly terrible. Simply flush your money down the toilet; you'll have more fun.
3,pretty good mid-90s rock,"i remember hearing moon june spoon on the radio a few years ago, and recently went on an online trek to find out who did it, needless to say i found out it was spot, bought the cd and im pleasantly surprised to find its a nice muscular but laid back melodic rock, i guess they call it post grunge, i call it damn good."
5,We love this thing!,"Be really careful when ordering your product with relation to the size. There are only a few inches difference between a large and extra large, but I had to return my large for the extra large because those few inches make all the difference. Outside that, we love this thing. I feel really comfortable putting my yellow lab in the kennel when we're traveling. We even went through a pretty good rain while driving and she stayed dry inside. I don't know that I'd leave it outside all night with raining weather, but for a few hours riding in the bed of the truck it worked really well. It does make picking up the kennel easier (obviously empty); less ackward."
2,Way too big!,"I bought this for my 16lb beagle & her crate for her 12+ hour trans-pacific flight. I ended up returning this as it was way too big for her crate. I measured her crate & went with the one that stated was between her crate measurements. We received it promptly, but I could've put another 1/2 crate in there it was so big! Very disappointing. We had ordered the medium sized cover & were unable to locate a small size even though her crate isn't small. She made the flight just fine, luckily we were moving overseas in May & had no restrictions on weather or she may have had to stay."
1,Failed delivery,"I never received this kennel jacket due to a shipping problem. By the time the shipping error was detected and I was informed I would have to reorder the kennel jacket the price had increased by more than double the original ""purchase"" price. Therefore, my star rating is not a reflection of the product itself but of my frustration with shipping and severe price increase."
3,SIZING IS INACCURATE NO WIGGLE ROOM,Get the specs and add one inch to your kennel or it will NOT FITseems to be no concideration for the seam?overall the jacket is an awesome addition to your kennel/carrierfor hunting dogs traveleing in the back of your truckinsulated for heat as well to keep the beating sun deflected.A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR BEST FRIEND.
2,X-large cover,The covers were to small for the airline sized crates I use for my Akitas. Wish they had made bigger ones
2,Generic Joe,"So this isn't REALLY G.I. Joe. It is a much later effort than the super cartoon of the 80's when the Joes had lost quite a bit of steam. No Snake-Eyes. No Storm Shadow. Just a bunch of Eco-Warrior guys I've never heard of fighting some toxic avenger reject who turns bugs into huge eating machines. Cobra commander makes a short appearance, but that is the only real connection to the old Joe legacy. Not a very good cartoon. And not really G.I. Joe either."
4,Comentario,"Este disco es una muy buena produccion con nuevos arreglos por Aleks Syntek. Muy refrescante toque a los grandes exitos de Mecano respetando las magistrales letras de Nacho y Jose Maria Cano.La cancion ""Hijo de la Luna"" tiene un elegante toque de mariachi y musica tradicional mexicana. Rejuvenece la tan especial interpretacion de Ana Torroja. Escuchando ""Un anho mas"" se ve claramente la influencia de Aleks en esta buena coleccion. La version de ""Barco a Venus"" en rumba me tomo por sorpresa."
2,Anachronistic drivel,"The poet seems to be under the impression that ""light-hearted"" objectification of women, tired assesments of New York's glories, and peep-shows disguised as poems, are charming. Hardly--in 1950 this book might have been tolerable, but in 2001 it's insulting. One would expect more from a Bryn Mawr grad!This collection suffers deeply from a nostalgic attachment to a past that never was, and labors under the strain of the creation of a forced, false poetic persona. Even the love poems feel tainted.The poet clearly has a modicum of talent, but seems too invested in covering over a gap at the centre by layering details to address his subjects with respect, grace, or gratitude."
4,Lemon Fruit Review from NC,We were very pleased with the price and quality of the lemons but not happy that it took about 10 business days to receive (Outer Banks of NC) them. Suggest ordering well in advance of use. Will order again -- but more in advance.
3,Fresh Lemons,"Item was good. Needs to do a better job in packing. Lemons were put in a square Priority shipping cardboard box, by the time I received it the box was round and the lemons were bruised. Other then that they tasted good. Shipping was fast and timely. I would use them again in a pinch."
4,"A Brief, but Excellent Philosophical Work","This book only takes about half an hour to read, but it contains a deep philosophical message about finding the divinity that resides in everyone. If you've listened to Mike Dooley's ""Infinite Possibilities,"" CD, you will really enjoy this book. If you haven't been exposed to these ideas in another form, the book might be just a little confusing, but still certainly worth your trouble. I very much considered a 5 star rating, but I gave it 4 on account of the fact that I really wanted more to read on this fascinating subject."
5,a great perspective of reality,"Excellent motivating book to take responsibility for your life. Witty and profound Dooley offers insight and a true perspective of life on the planet earth. A primer for ""Conversations With God"" book 1."
1,Can't believe anyone actually likes this book!,"I love Mike Dooley's ""Notes from the Universe"" so I looked forward to reading this book since he endorsed it. I was completely disappointed. It appears to be an allegorical representation of the ""universe,"" but it could have been written by a child. It has absolutely no interesting insights. It takes about ten minutes to read. It was a complete waste of time and money."
4,good,"That story by Diana Atkinson was absolutely incredible. Without having the book right here in front of me to recall specific details, all I can say is that I remember a few of the stories to be good, while most were just regurgitations of Buddhist teachings. I'm sorry but I read Sutras and Philosophical works all the time so none of that is going to impress me. What i like to read are stories like Diana like give you a true experience and that truly move you and teach about the sheer reality of the human condition."
4,"Not sure at first, but it got better","It took me a little while to get into this book. Penman's Welsh Trilogy along with her other books are really quite superior to her mysteries. With that said, the mysteries are a good read and written well, but if you are expecting it to grab you like her other books you will be disapointed. Perhaps it's because they are shorter in length and you don't get quite as attachted to Justin as you can Richard III or Simon de Montfort or either of the Llewelyns. Maybe because Justin isn't based on a real person from history. You will enjoy the book as long as you don't expect it to be like her other books."
4,The Queen's Man-Enjoyable Light Reading,"While I am aware that the author has a reputation for historically accurate ""fiction;"" if you are looking for historical accuracy in this book I believe that you are missing the point. This is a mideval mystery, it's not intended to be historically accurate. If you enjoy fast-paced light reading with a plot you'll like this book."
4,Not the best but quite good.,"Not quite up to the work of other medieval mysteries, such as those by Candace Robb and Caroline Roe, but still a good read. I found her characters realistic and enjoyable. Her setting gives a good sense of time and place."
3,A Medieval Knigh with a Cowboy Attitude,"The tread used by the author to link the medieval ages with a suspense novel is skillfully used and indeed we are presented with a book that is fun to read. Regretfully, the main character, Justin, have an attitude and a way to approach the Queen of England which in the highly stratified times of the Middle Ages, were the peasants could not talk looking at the eyes of their lords, is ridiculous to the Eleanor having a conversation with a ""hired sword"" like two friends chatting in a cafe eating donuts. Sadly the Justin de Quincy is just the typical representation of American best sellers heroes who are individualist with a lot of luck, and who end in bead with the beautiful girl of the story. If Mrs. Penman had worked harder in the psychology of the hero we could have had a five star novel, but as I mentioned before, that is not the case."
3,Not Quite What I Expected,"I am a big SKP fan since having read The Sunne in Splendor years ago and have eagerly devoured her other books. Figured I'd try this one as a bit of a departure from her meticuously researched historical fiction. It was an ok read, just not up to the level of her other works. To date, this is the only one of her period mysteries I have read."
1,"For certes, a dumb book.","I am a 75-year-old gobbler-up of mysteries of all sorts, and am more disappointed by this one than I have been by any other in years. For certes, ??? This recurring phrase presumably proves we're in the 12th century. But ""of course"" used equally often would identify bad writing in the 21st.The author's entitled to her opinion of Eleanor of Aquitaine. I think she likes the queen, but she doesn't make her likeable to me, though I'm already a fan (""The Lion in Winter"" is among my all-time favorite movies).Other annoyances: All the men ride Stallions. Subtle sexism? The hero's principal love interest rides a mare. Too many plot lines are left dangling, probably to make sequels easier to write.So be it. One star, and I'm not in the market for more Penmans."
5,A Page-Turner of a Mystery with a Unique Setting,"Anyone who enjoys reading about the Middle Ages will certainly enjoy this book. It is not an overbearing lecture about life during this time, but it's the little things that the author throws in that makes it so interesting. The mystery is excellent as well. The plot turns and twists keeping the reader interested. The mystery was well planned and it will keep you guessing. I plan to read more of Penman's books. I am hooked."
1,Penman damages Eleanor more than Henry ever could.,"Eleanor of Aquitaine is one of history's most fascinating women. Penman reduces her and her role to drivel as a result of Penman's clunky writing and total lack of ability to portray the tumult of the time in which Eleanor ruled. The best writing found in this book are the reviews found on the back cover of the book. Ms. Penman, what a marvelous era you write about. Give us more excitment than ""Justin swore under his breath. But his bluff had been called."" Really!"
3,not enough suspense,"Sharon Kay Penman writes very good non fiction about the Medieval times. Now she has used that quality to write medieval detectives. You can see that she knows that period (King Richard, Prince John) very well. The everyday life and atmosphere are decribed in detail and work fine for me. However, the story is not very eventfull and suspense is almost absent. Still I ordered the following 4 books of the serie, so it must not be all too bad!"
2,I was disappointed with this book.,"I am an avid fan of SKP's. I have read each of her previous novels many times and loved her strong female characters. I was excited to learn that she planned to write a book about Eleanor of Acquitaine and hoped that her characterization of Eleanor would be as entertaining as the characterization of Maude in ""While Christ and his Saints Slept."" It was not. Her other books brought the history alive for me. I had grown used to her skillful intertwining of history and fiction. I enjoyed the time it took to read the book and the way in which the stories unfolded. This book moved too fast, I was finished with it in less than two days. There were also too many fictional characters and not enough historical ones. Basically, this book is just a pale shadow of her other works."
2,Discouraged by lack of consistent tone,"I am an avid fan of Penman's work. The way in which she painted with words on Here Be Dragons and the books following in that vein was breathtaking. I am extremely disappointed in The Queen's Man. The medieval setting is in disparity with the dialogue. The book transitions are disjunct.If you want lovely novels that will immerse you in the medieval period, I whole-heartedly suggest Here Be Dragons, The Reckoning, the Sunne in Splendour, or when Christ And His Saints Slept. The Queen's Man was a real disappointment."
4,An entertaining medieval mystery,"Having read and watched several of the Brother Cadfael mysteries, I picked up The Queen's Man. I read through it in a couple of days, intrigued by the story and enjoying Sharon Kay Penman's clear, flowing writing style. She includes plenty of historical background without turning it into a history lesson; the characters are engaging and the mystery kept me guessing right up to the end. I would most definitely pick up her other books, and encourage you to give The Queen's Man a try!"
4,Surprisingly good!,"This is my first Sharon Kay Penman book and I was pleasantly surprised. I never read mysteries and picked this book up in desperation (I was going through withdrawal after finishing the Outlander series!). It took a couple of chapters to get into, but it got very good after that. I just had my library put Cruel as the Grave on hold for me and am going to pick it up now! Definitely worth reading!"
4,Excellent--as expected!,"As a huge fan of Sharon Kay Penman's EXCELLENT writing, I couldn't wait to read this book. It is very good, but not quite the same caliber as her other works, possibly because the focus on this book is the mystery instead of the telling of an historical event, so the incredible detail that usually makes her books so unique had to be left out. Still, I can't criticize much, since I could not do any better! Keep up the good work, Sharon!"
4,A great mystery from Ms. Penman!,"This book is decidedly different from Ms. Penman's previous novels, and she's proven that she can diversifyand still maintain her own engaging style! This book remainded me of the writings of another of my favorite authors:Mary Higgins Clark. Like Ms. Clark, Ms. Penman keeps the reader guessing by giving every new character a motive; every friend a reason not tobe trusted! Just when you're SURE you know who done it, there's a new piece to the puzzle! Perhaps the resolution of the murder was a little disappointing,but the revelation of twisted loyalties was fantastic! I congratulate Ms. Penman on an excellent foray into the world of Mysteries....now let's havemore Eleanor!!!!! :-)"
3,A bit of a let down,"I'm not normally a mystery reader. Perhaps I was expecting too much. I liked this book for the author's wonderful depiction of medieval society and the main character Justin De Quincy is well written. However, the solution to the mystery was a bit of a let down. I guess I hoped for some twist and turn in the story that led to a dramatic ending that I least expected. That was sadly not the case. I nearly gave the book 4 stars because the writing was excellent. However, the plot was less than thrilling at times and the ending was blah. So, 3 stars it is - and I hope that I'm not being too harsh simply because of my lack of mystery reading experience. Maybe the obvious is the usual solution????"
4,Young de Quincy seeks his fortune.,"Set in England of 1193, this novel begins with Justin de Quincy, who has just discovered that his foster father is truly his biological father. Complicating matters, de Quincy's father is a man of the cloth. Not wishing to be a part of his father's household, he leaves his home to seek his fortune.As luck would have it, he comes across a highway robbery. He manages to foil the crime, but not before the weathly traveler is mortally wounded. He presses a note into de Quincy's hand, saying that it is for the eyes of Eleanor of Aquitaine, the Queen.Eleanor's son, Richard the Lionheart is missing, presumed dead. Her younger son, John is suspected of conspiring to seize the crown.de Quincy delivers the letter to the Queen, who immediately engages him to find the highway robbers. The trail leads de Quincy straight back to the intrigues of Eleanor's court."
3,Good read for lover's of medieval times,"Sharon Penman's writing style brings to mind the novels of Diana Gabaldon. The Queen's Man is an intriguing mystery with interesting plot lines and characters. While not as detailed as the Gabaldon novels, The Queen's Man is an enjoyable read."
2,A dissapointment,"Compared to the excellent ""Wars of the Roses"" series, which I devoured avidly, this book pales. An overblown and unconvincing setting doesn't compensate for a lack of surprises and superficial plotting and characters, and a medieval setting that rings false. It's a boring mystery and an amateurish novel; most dissapointing from a usually wonderful writer and exhaustive researcher."
3,MEDIEVAL MYSTERY SLEUTHING . .. SOMETIMES GOOD,"Penman wrote these medieval mysteries to take a break from her more flowery medieval prose. Unlike the latter, she didn't necessarily know what the outcome would be to various mysteries so it gave her a new stretch in her writing career.QUEEN'S MAN follows the ... son of a Bishop who, by chance, is charged by Queen Eleanor to solve the mystery of a murdered goldsmith in connection with Richard the Lion Hearted. During this investigation, our hero meets a number of suspisciou people in the town, as well as makes a few friends here and there.The dialogue and descriptions are sparse compared to her more Historical works. If anything, this series focuses on movementand pacing. I would say this is more of a fun and quick read than the usual elegant, flowery and heart breaking Historical pieces Penman is usually know for in her works."
3,OK nothing special,"I agree with many of the previous reviews that Penman should stick to her historical fiction novels and stay away from her short mysteries. This book was not bad, but it certainly wasn't very memorable and it was way too short. She can do much better than that as we have seen in her previous novels."
4,Penman does it again,Sharon K Penman has done it again! Her scope and presentation of the medieval period is wide eyed and not sugar coated. This new endevor into mysteries has not stopped her. This is a great series and I hope she continues with this character for some time!
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The only thing you need to know about this book is it gives Jon Najarian the title of super trader. If you have ever listened to the garbage he spews on CNBC, you know this is clearly not the case. The Market Wizzards books are substantially better."
5,Outstanding,"This book is a must read for anyone exploring the law surrounding reproductive rights in this country. I would highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the law, in the legal right to privacy, and who is willing and eager to learn. It is by far the most enlightening and simply outstanding book I have read on the subject."
1,what was he thinking?,"what was mr. garrow thinking when he wrote this book? obviously he wasn't thinking about the well being of the country. his book is one sided and uninformed. i think he should do some real research before writing a book. anyways, what can he say about abortion? he's a man! it's certainly something he'll never have to deal with."
5,Kinleys II - Excellent Effort,"The Kinleys have exceeded expectations of their fans with this new album. Much more interesting than the first, while (like the Dixie Chicks) keeping with genuine country tradition. If you prefer authentic country (not ""pop crossover"" like Faith Hill) you'll love this one. If you like Dixie Chicks, you'll love this one. Buy it."
3,"""Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm in""","The Kinleys spohomore effort starts off strong with tracks like the woman's anthem ""She Ain't the Girl for You"", the Georgia Middleman penned ""I'm In"" and ""That's Gonna Mess You up"", but then trails off to mediocrity like ""Yeah, yeah, yeah"", ""Lovers"", and ""Me Too"".One other notable song on the disc is ""Somebody's Out There Watching"", the inspirational song that was also the sisters' contribution to the Touched By An Angel soundtrack.This CD is filled with a lot of pop sounding music, leaving me to wonder what direction it is the Kinleys are wanting to go with their music."
2,II is for 2 stars,"I liked Girl For You and a couple other tracks on this Cd but the rest is just filler. This talented duo should have spent more time on song selection. When you try to be too pop sounding, you lose your country audience."
3,Kinleys Go Out With A Sigh,"With their first album the Kinleys were a hot new promising group. With their new album cliche's hit all over. One of the worst is the not so clever title II. From the title track hit single (the only descent song on the album) the Kinleys keep in tone with each other, and sometimes you have to wonder who is singing. Some Kinley's fans may also wonder where ""My Heart Is Still Beating"" is on this album. As it was one of the first tracks released two years ago. Sadly that alone would have helped this dreary album become a little better in the overall scheme of things...."
3,Not bad for online,"Picked up book on a whim and while I can say I've read better books, Artifacts is a good way to wile away some free time. There's some promise, such as storytelling (mostly), but hopefully if another book should be written, it'll be tighter. Bordering on the fence, can go either way."
3,....,"the first four songs are just plain awesome. any primus/claypool fan should be able to dig these tunes as well as a few others on this album like precipitation and granny's yard gnome. those are definately 4/5 star songs all the way. and they sound even better when played live and that's very nice. the rest of the album isn't bad, but it won't really grab you like a primus album or like some of les' later solo side projects. those songs are just 'ok'.the collection of great songs and ok songs make for a decent album. buy it for running the gauntlet, holy mackerel, high ball with the devil, hendershot and a few others. everything else on the album is alright."
3,A few songs drag this down,"Let me start be saying that ""the Awakening"" is the highlight here. ""Holy Mackerel"" is another great track, and overall the album is solid. Worthy of only 3 stars only because of a few songs that suck. Here they are: ""Calling Kyle"", ""Highball with the Devil"" (It's way too repetitive!), ""Rancor"" and ""Percipitation."" Good efort, but not up to par. I think this album should have done away with the slower songs becasue this album is all about Les Claypool, and the tracks that slow down often don't showcase his talent. Ex: ""Calling Kyle."" Not for casual listeners, but recomended to harcore Les/Primus fans."
5,Pure enjoyment,I knew of Les from Primus years but I was not that into the band. Then last year at the moe down I saw him play for the first time. I have been in awe since. I chose this disc from the other reviews and I have to say that I listen to it a good 3-4 times a week. If you are just starting out collecting Les music then I feel you would enjoy this. It is excellent for a studio album (live is always better with any jam band as you know!) Happy listening!
5,Definately a must have,"If you want an Old School Street Punk album, this is what to get. The songs are extremely catchy and upbeat. The vocals are sometimes soft then later rough. If you like Murphy's, or Rancid this is for you."
4,Good album from the Chicago group,I loved the first verbow album. This one took a couple listens and is also very catchy and we'll written pop.
3,Unimpressive,"Verbow's claim to fame is unique instrumentation, but there is more to a band then the occasional cello. Once the novelty wears off, they stand revealed as yet another substandard alt band."
3,Not very satisfied,This is not the first time I have purchased this item and somehow I did not feel these boots were of the same quality.
4,Gotta love the Timbs,"I absolutely love Timberland's Nellie Chukkas, but I found the Tabasco ones fit a bit narrow across the ball line despite the Medium indicator on the size. I also found the same thing true with my Porcelain ones. Length was fine. I'll just have to break these in a little more carefully than the others I own."
2,Not a comfortable boot,"These shoes did NOT live up to their cost. I have already sent them back. I didn't have them but a few days and the laces were falling apart. They were not comfortable at all, and these were wide width and my feet felt like they were in a vice. I have never had a problem with sizing with other shoes before! I would never buy Timberlands again."
3,Great look but runs narrow and has poor foot support,"I really love this boot... but everything great about it is superficial. They run narrow and have a cheap foot bed. Very poor support. But the style sure is what I like.I ordered an 8.5 wide and they were more like a medium... they were snug but after I broke them in they seemed to stretch out and felt better. They didn't last a year and a half before the insides were all tore up and I pulled a metal bar out of the footbed, lol. Huh?! That never happened before with any shoe. I didn't even use them everday... but I did do some walking in them. Nothing extreme. But the outside held up fine.Even though I knew better and feel they are waaaay overpriced for the quality... I love the look and ordered a second pair. This time in a size 9 wide so I could put some padding in there for better foot support. It seems to help. I will only wear them to work now as I don't know how quickly these will also fall apart..."
4,"Timberland Women's Nellie Premium Ankle Boot,Black,11 M","Resists moisture really well. My feet have stayed dry during snowy/wet weather. Only time will tell about summer time wear on hot and rainy days. However, it's taking longer than I had anticipated for the instep to break in, so my feet feel a bit tired by the end of my work day. Other than that, it's a great boot."
5,Great value,"These boots are very comfortable, waterproof and a great value. Worn with dress slacks during the winter snow storms they complement a professional look."
5,Timberland Women's Nellie Ankle Boot,"I love this boot. I rarely order shoes over the internet, but these caught my eye. They look good and they feel wonderful. I wore them all day and my feet were not uncomfortable. They keep my feet warm in snow and cold weather. I am so happy I bought these boots."
3,Pretty shoes but uncomfortable,I really like the color. It is a really pretty shoe. My only problem is that it feels so narrow. I bought a wide shoe. And the shoe tongue is very stuff as other reviewers said. Wish they fit better because i love the color.
2,Woman's Timberland Ankle Boot,"I had not purchased a Timberland boot in several years and decided upon the purchase. Upon receiving them, I tried on two tube socks and the tongue was so sharp and short that it jabbed into my skin with the socks on. In addition, the boots were durable, however, the boots itself were too heavy to walk around and were too stiff. I had always worn Timberland previous to this purchase and Timberland has changed the make of their shoes dramatically.I contacted Timberland and their response was that they are made over seas. For years there was never an issue with the tongue, as it had a pad around the rim of the tongue and the tongue was extremely long. The boot itself was never heavy nor stiff. Back in the day, they were great to wear on a daily basis.Do not blame Amazon, blame Timberland Company for cutting costs. I will not purchase this product again. Shame on Timberland Company!!"
2,"Great look, completely uncomfortable","I bought these and while they look great, they are painful to wear. I thought I just needed to break them in, but after wearing them over the winter, they are still painful to wear. I can only wear them for an hour or two a time. They are too rigid and simply can't be broken in. There is no give at all so I can't lace them up. They actually change the way I walk. If I wanted to wear uncomfortable shoes, I would just wear heels."
1,Ouch!,"Ordered these a few days ago and when I first tried them on, I liked them EXCEPT the right boot is MUCH narrower than the left, even though they're both listed as Medium width. I have narrow feet & the right one pinches.After the first day trying to break them in, my ankles were SORE AS HELL from where the top of the boot rests. The material is just too hard & there's no give to them at all while walking. Lace these very loosely or you will be sorry! I can only hope that they become more flexible with time. Won't be ordering these again. What a waste. :("
3,"nice, but....","I purchased a pair of these boots a few years ago in a shoe store in size 7M because the next size up was too big. This year, I purchased this pair of black ones in the same size through Amazon.com. I didn't use them right away and regret it because I cannot return them. They are way-y-y-y too narrow and not nearly as comfortable as the ones I bought in the shoe store. As a result, I will probably never buy shoes online again."
2,It is stiff and runs way too narrow,"I always wear size 7, D (wide) and that is exactly what I ordered. After I tried them on, I found they are way too narrow and stiff (they feel like medium width B). They hurt my feet and I don't like them at all. I contacted the seller many times, but no response regarding how to return them. If you want to buy these shoes, you should really size up the width."
4,Camera battery,"What can I say? Seems to work just fine, and at a good cost. The battery is a bit larger than the original battery on my camcorder and feels awkward at first (the JVC equivalent is similar). That's the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5. It's the price you pay for more recording time."
3,Cam Battery,"I thought this battery would keep a charge twice as long as my original small battery, but I was lucky if it lasted 45 minutes without using the zoom. Use the zoom and it uses much more battery charge."
4,"Good battery, even better price.","I needed a longer-lasting battery pack for my band's gigs as my old battery that used to last one hour only lasts 20 minutes now. Fully charged, it lasts up to about 2 hours. Only complaint is that it sticks out quite far from the back of the camera, but I usually put my camcorder on a tripod anyway.Overall a great product and an even better value compared to the JVC-brand battery."
5,A mind-blowing experience!,"I have read the book Anno Domini 2001 by David A. Simpson. I was captivated from the first page and read it through without putting it down.... The descriptive language is brilliant and I had absolutely no problems imagining that I was there. The story starts on an space-ship and from there it goes on. If you have an open mind, this book has a lot to offer, and you will start questioning things you've taken for granted all your life. Enjoy!"
5,Cinderella shoes,"What a nice pair of shoes to float and walk on ALL DAY... and NO problem or pain on the feet! Highly recommend this pair or any other pair made by Helle Comfort shoes! True to size, height and fit.... own a lot of these shoes made by this brand becuz of its great comfort and style. Same category in comfort as 'Mephisto', ' Arche', Paul Greene and Taryn Rose."
2,Disappointed,"I decided to take a chance on this CD. I was disappointed. On many songs, Adkins relies on gimmicks, such as Up on Mars. Every punk rock band that I've ever listened to sounds better. Hints of excellent guitar playing are heard once in a while, but nothing is developed. His voice, with so many years to develop and practice, is usually outside any good range, so most songs sound like an old country singer who just never had what is takes to really sound good. Clearly, the man enjoyed being on the stage and having fun. You might like it with a six-pack under your belt, but otherwise, you won't."
5,Excellent alternative music choice,"Hasil Adkins is a brilliant performer. His songs are always from the heart and his style of music is very creative. His well-crafted songs will take you from deep in the West Virginia woods (""No Shoes"") to the reaches of outer space (""Up on Mars""). He and his band have a unique sound that is sure to please most anyone."
1,Why is it here?,The ambiguous ending to The Giver comes after its message was so eloquently delivered to each reader on a personal level. That is why it needed not ending. Each reader ended the book his or her own imagination in such a way that their own individual message would end. The Messenger takes away all power and lesson from the Giver. It is a cheap story that involves no higher thought processes to understand - there is not nothing to understand. Such a waste.
1,Avoid if you are over the age of 10,"This was an insipid rehashing of the mythical story of Jesus Christ. Matty, who was my favorite character from Gathering Blue (a vastly superior book)is taking the Jesus Christ pose as he makes the ultimate sacrifice by saving humankind and the world itself in one fell swoop by dying. Allusions to Christ abound throughout the book until the whole process becomes trite and silly. As we are all familiar with this storyline it was a tedious read with an ending I fully expected. Try ""The Giver"" if you are interested in Lowry's work, as it's a far more thoughtfully developed and mature work not stunted by Lowry's unfortunate need to proselytize."
3,An interesting end,"I am not the most prolific reader out there, so for me to say that I had never heard of ""The Giver"" may not be surprising. I am surprised however that this is an unsung series. I wholeheartedly enjoyed the three book. The third book in the series wasn't quite as nice as the first. ""The Messenger"" is still very enjoyable, and I think anyone who is curious to read the first book, or has read the first book and enjoyed it, wouldn't be disappointed in this stories ending. I would certainly recommend it to an adult, and would hope a parent gives the series to their child."
4,Very good book,When I read gathering blue I didn't really think it was all that great but I really liked this one!!!!!!
5,Giver foursome!,"As number 4 in the Giver series, this may be the best. I loved the metaphor of newcomers - I believe there is a message there for our day!!"
2,Perfect martyr disservice to #1 and #2,"(...)The Giver and Gathering Blue are two books that have a profound effect because they explore the mixture of good and evil above and below the surface in varying versions of possible post-apocalyptic societies. Messenger is not a fitting end to the other two. It seems an insult to the complexity of mankind, and the good and evil of the societies she has constructed to have an end solution lie with an all-good, all-giving martyr character. The message then is that we have no control over navigating the complexities of our societies except to wait for another savior, which cheapens both The Giver and Gathering Blue and the choices each character made to defy their societies."
4,You fill in the blanks,"I did not like this book as much as the first two in the series. However, art is not always supposed to cheer us up. I think that Lowry is the kind of author who really wants the reader to become the storyteller and fill in the blanks. There is no neat package at the end, even in the book which is the third of the trilogy. Matty's true name communicates what I believe to be Lowry's central message. I don't want to spoil the end, so I won't reveal his true name, but the following quote is similarly revealing, and my favorite of the book. ""So you could meet in the middle with your gifts? It wouldn't be so hard if you only went half way. If you met."" Despite the abrupt ending, Messenger is a must read for those who have read The Giver and Gathering Blue."
3,Weakest of the series,"The quality of the Kindle book itself was great. No typos, no odd spacing issues. The three stars I've rated are just that I didn't find this book as engaging as the others in the series (The Giver, Gathering Blue, Messenger, and Son). For a book this short I also thought it was steeply priced at $7.99 for the Kindle book. If you're planning to read the other books in the series, I would recommend reading Messenger. Much of the content of Son won't make sense without the context of Messenger."
5,love it,I really like Messenger. It tied both the books together and was always on going and caught my attention. Can't wait to finish up the series with Son.
5,Messenger,I loved it.The book was a great attachment to the Giver series. I enjoy every second of it.I recommend it
4,Matty's journey,I liked this a lot. I thought it was a really good way of showing what greed and fear can do to a society when you give up everything to get material gain - and then want to protect it. I like how Matty turned from a boy to a man through the novel.
2,Disappointing,"So, this book wasn't as good as The Giver. And it does help to read The Giver and Gathering Blue before this one, since they are companion books. But it's not necessary.The word to describe this book for me is ""interesting."" It was a quick read. It was clean. It teaches a good moral. And it leaves enough unsaid that it makes you have to think for yourself and try to figure out what's going on. I got a little caught up in trying to remember Gathering Blue, so I could piece together some details. Overall, I liked it. But it was a little weird.And now it's made me want to read The Giver again."
3,A bit rushed,"My feelings on the book are simple. I feel as if this book was rushed. While the story was completed without holes or lingering questions, I feel as if the author left out a bit of substance. This definitely did not live up to ""The Giver."""
4,Pretty good,"I believe thar this is just amazing, it blew my mind! I actually do mind the questionable ending, with endless possibilities of what happened. Though I did enjoy trying to think of endings of what happened with Jonas and Gabriel's journey, this just gives me a new topic. Who discovered Gabriel and Jonas' body? And yes, I am 99% sure that it is Gabriel in the story, seeing as he was discovered with an older boy who did not survive. I do enjoy that she did mention Gabriel, Kira, and Matt-or Matty- but what about Thomas and Jo, what happened to them?But, as a whole, it was a very enjoyable book!"
4,#3 of 4,"This is a continuation of The Giver series and it answers many, but not all of the questions you had after reading 1 & 2."
1,Not the next book for my class - disappointing!,"I have introduced many of my ELL, high school students to Lois Lowery and the depth of her characters. She is a brilliant writer and capable of inspiring fierce passion in her readers as they encounter shocking details of her utopian worlds. I was anxious to read this companion novel and had planned to share it with my class this January. Although the series is written for 6th graders and older, this book's simplicity, in its message, language and writing style will inspire no one. I am sadly disappointed."
2,Messenger,"This book wasn't worth the paper and ink that it took for Lois Lowry to write it. After all the anticipation, Messenger was very poorly written and a let down. While the Giver, gets a thumbs up, Messenger gets two thumbs down!"
1,This book sucks!,"Compared to the Giver and Gathering Blue, this book is a HUGE disapointment. It left alot more questions than answers, and in the end it's just one big question mark. It's great if you like making up your own ending to stories, but it's just horrid if you don't.It gives closure to Jonas from The Giver, but other than that, it's a sh*tty book. My one question is...what the hell happened to Gabe? Jonas's brother?"
2,It is a must NOT read!,"I DID NOT LIKE this book. It was sooooo retarted and i would not recommend it to anyone, ever. I had to read it for school and it was very hard to get through it, I'll tell you that. But, it was ok... in that it was better then the other book we had to read and the book we had to read last year. Definetely. I have never read the giver or gathering blue so I can't tell you how it relates to those but if it's like this one, I wouldn't recommend those either."
5,Beautiful finish to the series,"Excellent conclusion to The Giver trilogy. This book is important for youths and adults to read. There are many underlying lessons within the text that I would just nod my head at while reading.I don't want to give an overview of the plot, as I'm sure others have already done so. Just know that it's a quick read for adults and I found this one more interesting than Gathering Blue. Even utopia places where everyone helps everyone else and is accepting of differences like Village can become corrupt and hateful. The ending is a bit surprising, sad, and beautiful at the same time."
4,Messenger review,Bought this book for my son; he loved it! You must read all three books in the series!
5,Messenger,I wish there were more books in the series!This book is very readable and the world the author creates seems very real.
4,beautifully written; one big flaw,"The series never answers the question of what happened to the community of the Giver. The personally focused stories are all wonderfully crafted, however, and I enjoyed them very much."
4,"Clear your schedule, you'll be reading all day","It was only recently that I learned there was more to ""The Giver"" than the first book. I read it in my younger days, and then earlier this year picked it up again. Wow, the difference that book can mean to you after years is unbelievable. I picked up Gathering Blue, finished it in 2 days, then moved to Messenger (book 3 of 4) and it was done in a day. I was scared that Lowry was going to have Middle-book-syndrome going on, where the books leading up to the finale were weak, but that's not the case! This book will keep you turning pages, wanting more, to know what happens in this universe."
4,Great....,I was excited to find out what happened to the characters in both the Giver and Gathering Blue. I was surprised to find out the lives of some of the characters. I was upset that the ending ended like the other two. I had hoped that this book would finally tie up all of the loose ends completly. I guess Lowry is going to have to write yet another stellar book!
5,The Messenger,"The Messenger by Lois Lowry was an excellent book. It was about a boy named Matty. Matty is in his late teens, but when he was a little boy he moved to Village. He came from a place where he almost starved to death and was abused. But now that he moved to Village, he has gotten over his past. Matty soon finds out that he has a gift, which is to heal. With a touch of his fingers, he can heal anything, except it takes energy out of him. Village had always allowed people to move to Village, but suddently the people of Village voted to close the borders. Before Matty posts the sigh up around Forest, Seer, the blind man who had lived with Matty all his life tells Matty to bring his daughter Kira back. Forest has been hostile to people, but never to Matty. But when he enters Forest to deliver the message, he realizes that Forest is more hostile then ever. Will Matty make it? Will his gift fail him? What will happen to him? This book is a very good book. I strongly recommend it?"
2,Somewhat of a letdown...,"In this book, a companion novel to The Giver and Gathering Blue, Matty is a messenger, one of the few with the power to travel through the forest. When his community, so well-known for their acceptance of strangers, decides to close its gates, Matty and his mentor know that something very wrong is happening- and Matty, with his still undeveloped power, may be the only one who can stop it.I am a great fan of the Giver, and enjoyed Gathering Blue a lot, so I was very excited when this book came out, and read it in a single day. However, I was extremely disappointed. It felt like the author had written it simply because she promised a third book, not because she had a really cool idea. The characters seemed shallow and undeveloped, and the description of the village didn't fit in with the one given in Gathering Blue. You never find out the actual problem of the village, and the ending leaves way too many holes- and not ones that are designed to make you think."
3,Well Written But Not For Me!!!,"I recently read this book and expected greater things. In my opinion this book was darker and more depressing than the other two,TG and GB( The Giver and Gathering Blue).The characters were protrayed well and the surrondings were rightly described. Athough it was different than the other two I thought it was well written and should be tried before you turn it down, because of this or any other reviews."
5,This is such a good book!,"This is a really, really good book. It centers around Matty (who was Matt in the second book Gathering Blue) and he finds out that he has a gift. Also, he has fled to a different village and is living there. People are starting to tell lies and to keep secrets from each other and the ""forest"" starts to grow as people keep secrets and lie. So Matty must go on a journey to get Kira (his friend from Gathering Blue) and bring her back to the village before the forest gets so thick that she can't ever come. Matty hits disturbing and challenging obstacles on his way back. This is a very sad book and if it doesn't make you sad then you don't love these books! A definent must read! I recommend it to anyone!"
3,Bad Ending,I thought that the book was great but all of her books have an ending that doesn`t tell you what heppens to the character. I wish that i knew what happened in this bok and The Giver.
3,Messenger,"I was extremely disappointed about this book. First of all The Giver and the next two books have nothing in common!!!! I thought maybe in the third book they would tie together the 1st and 2nd book, but it didn't! 2nd of all, it doesn't finish Kira's story or what she did to make her village a better place. It didn't mention Thomas or Jo and what happened after she finished the Singers Robe!SPOILERS ALERT:In the end it leaves you hanging... I was confused on whether Matty was alive or dead and what happened after he used his powers...Overall the book wasn't worth the time. If you read the Giver and Gathering Blue, don't read Messenger! It would ruin the first two stories for you."
3,More of a forward for the next book,"It was short, and left me wanting a lot more. But that's what the next book is for I suppose"
3,The Story Continues,The Giver storyline continues with yet another tale of an adolescent who senses the world isn't as it should be and seeks to make it better. I was skeptical of these sequels when I read the second book (Gathering Blue) but Messenger was outstanding. I highly recommend it.
1,broke after 1 use,nice looking chair but it broke after using it one time. it's a chair which has one function but apparently the manufacturer hasn't really figured out how to construct products that actually work.
4,"Not sturdy, slightly overrated","We've had some fun with these, but they did not meet my expectations. The blox are smaller and flimsier than I thought they would be. They look great once set up, but are very easily knocked down. We have found creative ways to use them, which is a definite plus. But my kids don't pull them out to play with them unless I initiate it."
5,EXCELLENT TOY,"This toy is SO MUCH FUN!!! Not only do my nephews love it, but I love playing with it with them. It is incredibly safe and durable and also teaches kids about how to build, enhancing conceptual skills."
2,"The velcro flaps suck, but read this tip","The flaps are such a huge pain! After a year of cursing this toy everytime my kids wanted to play with it, my 7 year old genius child slid a little plastic toy spatula to open the velcro flaps and it worked like magic."
3,Squashed my Patience!,"In theory, these are a great idea; but in reality, not so much.The velcro is too strong for little hands (although I suspect the hold will get looser as the fibers get full of dust & the never-ending supply of goldfish crumbs found at our house).And don't even think about getting these if you have pets. The hair clings to them like double stick tape. Seriously, I thought about popping a handle on one of them and using it as a dry mop!I think they'd be greatly improved with vinyl coverings (easy to wipe up & clean) and lighter velcro. Until then, we'll keep lugging around the couch cushions & the air mattresses."
2,Tough to put together,"Great idea for a toy and the kids loved it when they first saw it, but, it is very hard to put the pieces together. The velcro is tough to separate and takes way too long, the interest is lost. When I finally get it together the kids have to be very careful, if they fall into the side it usually tears apart-not very sturdy."
2,Good concept Poor design,"The concept is great, the design is lousy. The trouble is that the blocks are flimsy without attaching on multiple sides, and the velcro is SO difficult to undo from the cushion. As an adult I have a difficult time with this, sometimes taking up to 2 minutes for just 1 side of a cushion, so I can't see a child under about age 6 or 7 being able to do it themselves. My fingers and knuckles get chewed up in the process. The velcro is so hard to pull apart that some of the pieces are now coming off the cushion and I will have to sew them back on. The cushions should be thicker and the velcro possibly done a different way. I thought it would be a great building toy, but it's not very good for that. My son just piles the cushions and jumps on them and over them. When we want to ""build forts"" we'll probably just go back to using my couch cushions. This is an expensive toy for what you get."
2,The velcro is too hard for a 3 year old,My 3 year old loves to play with it and loves the idea she can build her own house. The problem is the velcro. It is too hard for her to manipulate. It's too hard for me to open the velcro. The bottom line is she could not play it by herself so it is not recommended if you need your children to play it by themselves.
3,"Newer, inferior squash blox",Oh dear. My kids really loved these when Santa brought them two years ago - so they asked for more. Santa delivered but not the manufacturer. The fabric is cheap and loose. The foam is stiff and probably will deteriorate fast. But the real kicker is that they are smaller! That was their biggest disapointment.
3,I liked it overall,"Well I really liked it overall, I have books 1 to 3 so I'm really looking forward to getting 4 through 6. I don't think much of the editor though since there are too many mistakes that should have been cleaned up or fixed, there's could care less when it should be couldn't care less, the last sentence in a paragraph ends at the so you don't know the what, & there are several instances of a the a & an and, all of which should have been fixed."
4,stick with it,"I can only suppose it had been too long since I read the previous book in this series, because I was completely lost in the first few chapters. It's not just because the authors kept referring back to them, but because they were referring back to such insignificant people and events. Obviously, there are many strong characters that have such small parts that it takes away a bit from the focus of the story.Despite this, this book is still quite enjoyable. If you can hang through the beginning, the action starts rollercoasting from then on. Lots of action and suspense. Tony and Sue are having a bit of marriable problems that they have to work out. Tony gets to meet Lucus. Bobby finds an interesting female. Then there is the creature killing Sazi that Tony agrees to find and kill. Then there's a small reappearence of the teenage mass murderer, Scotty. Sooooo many characters, so little time. Focus, authors, focus."
3,I gave it three stars because...,"I gave this book three stars because it is the textbook for my sight-singing/dictation class here at college and seeing it on Amazon gave me the creeps simply because that class haunts and consumes me! :) So I guess it's a good book because it's really helped out my sight singing techniques, but still... it frightens me to see this book on Amazon :) I don't think I could look at it unbaised ever again. :)"
2,"Good textbook, horrible binding","It is what it is. If your music program uses this book, then it serves it's function. It has plenty of sight singing examples for duets and solo. I wish it had some rhythm exercises in it as well to make it more well rounded. The examples progressively get more challenging.My grievance with this book is that it is HORRIBLY put together. After about a semester of use the binding starts coming lose and the pages and cover pieces start to come out. It's very frustrating. My schools music program uses this book. After about 2 years everyone's book looks like a mess."
5,perfect,this item came in very quickly and is just what i needed for my class. there are many practice examples for sight reading/singing.
2,Too much money for an exercise book.,"This book HAS ONLY NOTES IN IT. The instructions are just on a few pages. I think the author could have spent some hours more in writing (and this is true EXPECIALLY IF WE LOOK AT THE PRICE).I'm at intermediate level in sight singing, and quite advanced in sight reading, I bought this book to improve my skills.I'll try to study on this book, I won't just let it ""rust"" on a shelf, but I EXPECTED MORE INSTRUCTIONS. MAY BE THIS CAN BE A WONDERFUL BOOK IF YOU PRACTICE ON IT CONSTALNTLY, but in these days, where self-teaching is more important than in the past I think this book has an OBSOLETE-APPROACH.THIS IS A BOOK FOR A SIGHT-SINGING CLASS IN SOME INSTITUTE. PERIOD."
4,Didn't Agree with everything,"But it was nice to see someone stick it to social conservatism. It is a philosophy based on hypocrisy and lies; The leaders and adherents of which have just as many skeletons in their closet as anyone else (and some more than most). These People think that waiving a cross around gives them the right to intrude on people's most private moments (the Terri Schiavo fiasco), regulate consensual relationships (their attitude towards homosexuals) , and disrupt what ought to be sacred and private (Fred Phelps). I can only be happy that the younger generation gives no indication that it will accept these people's arbitrary control. The Days of Social Conservatives having any meaningful power and influence are numbered. Thank God."
5,Dan Savage is my new hero,"Thank you, Dan, for giving people like me (proud but semi-closeted hedonists) a voice! And doing it in such a lucid and entertaining fashion. My refrigerator at home proudly displays a copy of pg. 14, paragraph 3. When that frige dies, it's just getting moved to the new one. Way to go Dan!!!!"
4,An Exploration of Sin,"Dan Savage explores the world around him at the turn of the 21st century through the seven deadly sins. His travels across the United States include the mundane and the fantastic, and together make for a good read. Though his opinions are strong, and many do not agree with him, Dan Savage makes a good case for and against each of the seven deadly sins of sloth, greed, lust, envy, rage, gluttony, and vanity."
3,No new insights,"Dan savage is not afraid to point out that the emperor has no clothes (and he should certainly get credit for that), but there was nothing particularly clever about this book. It has little educational value. It is a fun book to read but it lacks any new insights. The 7 sins framework was creative."
3,"Dan didn't really skip, not enough fun. disappointing","I love Savage's writing. He is both funny and insightful. I have read all his books, and his column, so I was greatly looking forward to this, but it was a letdown. He doesn't really enjoy any of the sins he ostensibly set out to commit, with the exception of greed. Dan let his hair down, so to speak, while gambling. However, he did a terrible job on gluttony and sloth, two of my personal favorite sins. Dan didn't enjoy overeating at all. His section on sloth turned out to be a muddled commentary on marijuana. And even the section on lust, while one of the better sections of the book, was milquetoast. I would think a ... man could do better in this area. Overall, not a bad book, but should have been so much better."
3,Dan takes on the moral majority,"Dan Savage brings the same sharp wit and practical outlook he utilizes in his syndicated sex column to ""Skipping Towards Gomorrah"", which explores pleasure and vice in our culture. The result is an entertaining, if somewhat lightweight, read. The structure of the book itself is a bit of a gimmick, with each of the chapters of the book being about one particular ""deadly sin"". This makes the book easy to read, although not particularly in depth. Dan does make some very good points (that not everybody who uses drugs recreationally is an addict, that not everyone is wired for monogamy), and it's also interesting and admirable the way he treats the ""pride"" chapter: as a way of criticizing, instead of glorifying, gay ""pride"" events. If there is an underlying theme to this book, it's ""live and let live"" ... and with so many public figures constantly moralizing and condemning other people, this is a philosophy our society could use a re-introduction to."
1,Political Garbage,"I cant believe I bought this book. I thought it would be interesting, and maybe funny, but it was Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity upside down. Social commentary from jackasses on the far right OR far left is boring and predictable. A book about the 7 deadly sins, telling stories and giving insight, without political commentary would be interesting. Dont waste your money on this book. It obviously written with a specific adgenda and without any orginal thought."
1,"very good writer, but....","The fact that Dan Savage is a talented humorist and a gifted writer doesn't mean that what he has written isn't stupid. It is. After all, he is first and foremost a humorist, and therefore his silly ideas shouldn't be taken seriously."
4,Slouching Toward Andy Rooney,"Dan Savage is a much-needed voice of reason in our country, where those in power are currently whittling away at our Bill of Rights under the guise of the War on Terrorism. These rights are protected only so long as watchful citizens jealously guard them, and Dan seems to be one of the few speaking out. One hopes his message reaches well beyond the narrow demographic who can be expected to read him.Unfortunately his tone in this otherwise-important book keeps slouching toward whining, pleading and preaching to the converted -- not unlike the ""conservative scolds"" he keeps scolding. I lost track of how many times he invoked Krispy Kremes and Bill O'Reilly as emblematic of the nation's ills. For this and this alone he loses a star in the ratings.He'd better watch himself, lest he become the next Andy Rooney. ""Did you ever wonder why it is that _____?"""
2,Skipping Towards Gomorrah,"I bought the book because it was the title my book group chose to read and discuss in September.This is not high-class literature but does include information that was new to me.The author has attempted to commit each of the so-called seven deadly sins in the location in the U.S. where he believes there are many others committing a specific sin; i.e. greed in Las Vegas. His observations about gambling seem to be well thought out and show his understanding of the process. Comments by the author about some of the other sins didn't demonstrate as much deep thought.The point author, Dan Savage, seems to be trying to make is that it's possible to commit one or more of the seven deadly sins and it won't kill you or send you to hell."
1,Disappointing,"I had high expectations for Skipping Towards Gomorrah, based upon the reviews of other readers, and based upon other writings of Dan Savage. I expected the book to be very funny.I found it rarely and only mildly amusing, and I was shocked and very put off by Dan's unqualified enthusiasm for the occupation of Iraq. I learned that Dan and I don't share much common political ground."
3,Thank God Dan Savage is Hiliarious,"I found this book to be incredibly entertaining, although I had hoped it would be a bit more hard-hitting. I breezed through it very quickly, because Dan Savage's writing style is so wonderfully funny and accessible - I've enjoyed reading his columns for years and years, and this book doesn't dissapoint in that arena.Skipping Towards Gomorrah is funny, and has the slight whiff of political punditry, Savage comes off in ""Skipping..."" sort of like a less-confrontational Michael Moore. Would that Dan Savage would get a little more in your face with his opinions, do some research and make some harder-hitting arguments. It's an enjoyable read, but I can't help but wonder if there wasn't a more influential book sleeping beneath the surface."
2,Not up to the Harris Men,"I really enjoyed the Harris Men and was thrilled to see this sequel but found myself not even caring how this book ended. There was no character developement, the plot seemed to slow down and stop at certain points and I found myself bored. These brothers don't seem to know what they want and was it just me or did all three Harris boys have problems with violence?Borrow this from a library."
3,It was okay.,"The women characters in this book got on my nerves. The step mother was alright. But the middle brother's wife was so nosey, I just wanted to yell into the book, ""Get A Life"". The oldest brother's wife, Tracy, well, she was just a plain 'ol B. Some of the sub-plots were cliched and predictable. How did I know ahead of time that the little girl was going to get hit by a car and bring the parents back together? How did I know that when the youngest son stopped that kid from robbing the store, not only was he going to get the job working at the store, but he was going to ""adopt"" the kid as well. Conviniently, the same kid works for and is murdered by the estranged wife's new man. You could see the tired story lines from a mile away. The first book, the Harris Brothers, (or maybe it was called Harris Men) was much better."
5,another good read,"i would like to say that the harris family was a good sequel to the harris men. i just love the diverse lives of caleb, marcus and austin. they each have interesting lives but maintain the true value of family, something that america finds hard to do. austin is the brother that is a lawyer,has a family and suppose to be the perfect somebody until he and his wife divorce and all things go downhill for him, marcus is the brother that has issues how he sees things in life and is the one that tries to keep the family together until he finally marries and start a family and caleb is the younger brother that is the troubled one, in a out of jail but wants to finally do right until he runs in some trouble with his baby mamas boyfriend who is a drug dealer and a thug. this book has major twists and turns and will keep you on your toes. i really enjoyed this book and cant wait until the next novel by r.m johnson"
5,Beautiful,"I loved this book. It's an oversized book and it's full of animals that you find in the Zoo. The illustrations of the animials are simply beautiful. Exactly my taste. The book has barely any text, only pages full of animials along with their names."
5,A hit with my 8 year old nephew!,"Recommended by a design blogger, my nephew really loved the book. Even his dad considered it ""cool""."
4,Fun if a bit educational look at animals,"No fun prose but great illustrations of a whole bunch of animals. They are grouped in some general themes (hot, cold, nocturnal etc.) and to be clear all the written information is in the back and borderline useful - but each page is covered in beautiful illustrations of animals. I am on my second book as we take it out for bedtime on a very regular basis. That is also why I gave it four stars - I love it and it seems sturdy but it did sort of wear out."
5,Great Big Wonderful Book with Excellent Illustrations,"This a very large (coffee table size) book filled with wonderful graphic illustrations of different animals by groups such as animals found in the desert under ""Hot""; creatures found ""On the Seabed""; animals with ""Spots and Stripes"". Great book. I'm a graphic artist and appreciate the book from an artistic point of view. My 4-1/2 year old daughter loves to find the chameleon among each group in the book. Brief description of each animal and creature is found at the back of the book under ""Secrets of the animals"". I bought this book when she had just turned 3 yrs old. This will be a great reference book for a long time to come."
5,The book was touching.,"A Storm Without Rain was a fantastic book that made me think even after I was done reading it. The ending brought tears to my eyes in a happy sad way. I loved how Jack became best friends with his own grandfather who was the same age as him, 15. Jan Adkins is a great author and I hope to read more of her books!"
5,The Unknown Wonder,"Jane Jensen. She deserves more exposure. I bought this CD 2 1/2 years ago and the thing is STILL, always in my CD player at home and in the car. Her music has an underground industrial sound, while her voice is highlighted with an 'angry innocence' tone. Jane, if you ever read this, PLEASE come out with another album. -p4"
5,Great Bible Comics,"I owned these when I was 7 and now that my daughter is 7 I have broken them out of storage and we are reading them together. They are still great. The stories are short enough to hold a child's attention, have some rymes to help a child read the words, and yet still pulls no punches with key points of the stories such as Saul's death. All done in a great format with colorful pictures. I love these books."
3,Identity Crisis,"Is this a black tea? Or a tisane? There's so little darjeeling that I wonder why bother putting it in at all. As well, the darjeeling is overpowered by all the other ingredients, so why not use a less delicately flavored black tea. As for the berries, well, the hibiscus overpowers those elements, so why not cut out the hibiscus altogether? I was disappointed, only because I like a full bodied cup of black tea, and didn't get it. I believe Numi offers an all-berry tea, and I would recomment that."
2,Pointless album,"The Lady of Rage was a vital component of the Chronic and Doggystyle albums. Dre knows how to bring different rappers together to produce a perfect blend of voices. The production on this album is good by the likes of DJ Premier and Daz Dillinger, but The Lady of Rage just doesn't have the talent to pull off a solo album with so few guest appearances. Only a few rappers are capable of that. The Notorious BIG...I can't think of another. Even Snoop Doggy Dogg has always relied heavily on having a large crew of rappers to back him up, and he was the front man of those two albums, not just a supporting rapper like rage was. I'm surprised Rage has made a second album. I won't be buying it. I bought this because I was in need of another Chronic/Doggystyle fix but this isn't it. I believe that music can be judged by how often you want to listen to it. I never feel like listening to this."
5,Timing Was Everything,"This classic CD by the Lady of Rage was highly anticipated due to her guest raps with various artists on Death Row Records.She truly paid her dues to get to the point of releasing her own music, but the label had started its financial free-fall and Necessary Roughness didn't get the backing it needed to receive the industry attention it deserved.That the raps hold up nearly 10 years after being released says everything one needs to know about Rage. The music came straight from Rage's heart."
4,Efficient compact Hot Water maker,"Boiling 2 cups of water done in 4 minutes and found it extremely efficient in comparison to old tech PocketRocket MSR. MSR fuel works with Jetboil when I don't have JetBoil fuel canisters. On first boil, stove removed easily. On 2nd boil, metal expanded from heat and it was difficult to remove cup from stove. So unless it's necessary to avoid accidental tipover, I don't think I'll lock the cup in place. I want to be able to remove the cup easily and it's not a good idea to be pouring liquid with the stove attached to the cup.On opening unit, bottom of cup has halo. It's not the imprint of a fuel can or the 4 legs of the stove. However, it won't scrub out. It's been useful to use dehydrated food (Mountain House) and pack less for camping."
5,Great Product,"I ordered this, I love them> HOWEVER - mine arrived broken... the Cup holder was snapped. I assume it was a shipping error. I am returning it and look forward to it being replaced. However that isn't the products fault. I was sad yes, but still find this to be a great product. Thank you."
1,93 or 66 lumens of brilliant white light?,I found this light on Smith & Wessons site and there it states this light delivering 66 lumens of brilliant white light. Amazon says 93 lumens. I was going to buy this light untill I seen this conflict.I own the Smith & Wesson Galaxy 13 LED Flashlight (10 White LED & 3 Red LED) and so far it has been working great for an led light.
2,batteries die fast and cost a lot!,"batteries are SO expensive and die very quickly, buy cheaper one that takes AA batteries would be better for you"
2,"Good Flashlight, temporarily",The flashlight worked good. It feels sturdy and seems like it's good quality. Batteries are super hard to find other than online I couldn't find a local store that carried them. My flashlight only worked for about a few months. I have put new batteries in and nothing happens so I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND this flashlight for the long run.
4,Great light for the money,I purchased this light to put on my AR-15. It works very well and is good quality for the money. The only down side is that the xenon bulbs are somewhat hard to find and are rather pricey. But I would recommend this light for someone who is looking for a quality tactical light for a bargain price.
3,Best for specialists,"Part 2 concentrates on the technical side of the Key Route - the cars, the signal system, etc, and is to my view less interesting than the routes and the stations, presented in Part 1, which is much harder to find. Still worthwhile!"
4,The best conclusion book I have ever read,"Without spoiling this book, it had a wonderful plot twist from the first the Night of the Eye, to the Medusa Plague, and then this conclusion, the Seventh Sentinel. I love what became of Lyim, and the fates of Guerrand and Bram. Of the Defenders of Magic Trilogy, I feel that this is the best of the three. The descriptions did not leave me utterly confused when I put the book down, yet did not insult my intelligence. Finally, I loved how they tied information from the two previous books into this one. I would suggest reading this entire series (suggestably from Vol. 1, to 2, and finally 3.)"
2,Disappointing,"To offer an alternative view, I felt this was definitely one of the lower end DL novels. I especially couldn't stand where the character developements went, and the tuatha magic had a very un-DL ambience about it. It did have a nice plot to back it up though, culminating in a wonderful climax. This is the only thing making it worth while, and it might be quite a lot better on its own. I preferred the first two."
3,Dissapointing ending of a good story built by the previous two books,"The first and second book of this trilogy are good. Those two brings up interesting question of how the story will end. Especially in Medusa Plague, where there is an moral dillema of friendship and duty,and the line between what's right and wrong becomes unclear. But the last book dissapoints me. There should be better ending. Stories of the magical gauntlet which absorb magic and makes all mages powerless, other source of magic, the switch of the main character are too much out of the context of the first and second book. It has weak link with the previous two. It is a dissapointing ending of the trilogy. It should have been better..."
4,The Seventh Sentinel : Defenders of Magic (Dragonlance),"From a differnt prospective I thought the book was very well written, could have been 5 stars........but didnt have the substance. The assasins which seemed strong at the introduction of the second book were made to look like idiots by being killed by Lyim. The ending was the best part of the book ."
4,Sweet and Wonderful,"I really loved this story because it was realistic. I could relate to everything, the emotions, the situatuions they go through, their problems, everything. Frances O` Roark Dowell captured their lives and feelings perfectly, creating a sweet, enjoyable read that I`m not going to be forgetting soon."
3,Every chapter a different person,"Eleven-year-old Kate and Marylin used to be best friends, but now they look at the world differently. Marylin wants to be a cheerleader and have boyfriends and use makeup, but Kate is happy just playing basketball with the boys. Marylin thinks that discussion of kissing is interesting, but when caught up in a kissing game, she is uncomfortable. Third and fourth graders who read the kissing chapter might be uncomfortable, too.This story suffers from a multiple-point-of-view problem. The POV changes so often, and there are so many characters narrating, that the reader never gets attached to any one character. Also, since the book was written in 2004, there is a striking lack of electronics in the students. They make calls on a home phone, write phone numbers on the wall of the closet, and have no iPods or cell phones. This book would be good for 4th and 5th grade girls if not for all the boyfriend-girlfriend kissing."
5,A Great Book!,"I loved this book so much! It was written so well and the characters were described beatifully and I felt like they were real it was so good! Kate seemed like the person I would become best friends with! We read ""Dovey Coe"" last year in my literarute class and I loved it! This one sounded good,too. I bought it at Half Price books last night and it was SO good that I read all 247 pages in one night! Frances O'Roark Dowell is a great author! I loved this book and it is SO recommended! READ IT NOW!!!"
3,"Good tracks, but dissapointing for what it's not","A bunch of good tracks on this album. However, the movie opens with one of the best tracks that Michael Jackson has done in years. Beautiful! Well, it's not here - nowhere to be found. A shame, since it does such a good job setting the tone for the movie. Not sure what the title of the song is, but it would singlehandedly force me to give this album a five star rating. Oh, well!"
1,"What, no MJ??!!??","I could not believe I was hearing a brand new track by the King of Pop when I saw the beginning of this movie. I was so excited, I immediately went online to buy it, only to see that it was not on the soundtrack! Now how the heck do you have Michael Jackson do a song for a movie and don't put it on a soundtrack? It's beyond me."
2,No MJ....,"I was equally disappointed that Michael Jackson's song opened the movie ""Get On The Bus"", but was absent from the soundtrack. There are some good tracks, but the soundtrack would have been much better had that song been included. For those who don't know, the name of the song is ""On The Line"", and it was written and produced by Babyface. The only place I have ever seen this song was on a special edition of ""Ghosts"". Hope this information is helpful to those who need it."
3,"some good tracks, some throwaway","Well, I never saw the film so I can't join the rank of disgruntled MJ fans out there. But I saw this CD in the sale bin of a local shop and a few tracks on here interested me, so I took the chance on the rest of the soundtrack. It's sort of what I expected; a hit and miss mix of tunes. The best ones, in my opinion, are the ""old school"" offerings from Curtis Mayfield, the Neville Brothers, and Stevie Wonder (doing a nice Bob Marley tune). I also love D'Angelo's cover of the old Eddie Kendricks song ""Girl You Need a Change of Mind."" That alone, is almost worth getting this CD. A track by Marvin Davis, ""I Love My Woman,"" is also quite nice. But other tracks, some with rap and hip-hop elements, from the likes of Doug E. Fresh, Guru, BlackStreet, and A Tribe Called Quest sound boring and dated to me. If you can get this CD for cheap, go for it. A handful of very good songs on here."
3,Good,But like everyoneelse I'm disapopointed there's no Michael Jackson on it.The song is called On The Line(written and produced by MJ himself not Babyface)But the other songs are still good. worth the money
4,Great illustrator,"Little lamb is excited to meet a butterfly in the middle of his meadow one day. He has so many questions to ask the butterfly about where he is from and why he flutters. But the little lamb has a hard time understanding the free spirited butterfly. Why can't the butterfly be just like him and stay in the meadow? The lamb begs the butterfly to never leave, but the butterfly doesn't listen. Finally after being caught in a storm together the little lamb begins to understand why the butterfly can't stay with him. Parents will love the message about accepting others for who they are and understanding that everyone is different or might have different needs. The story flows well and is somewhat lyrical. Bright, cheerful illustrations help tell the story. Children will love the bold brush strokes and large images. Both of my children enjoyed this book and commented on the story and illustrations.I received this book free of charge from Children's Lit in exchange for my honest review."
2,Descriptive title!,"But in some ways, it doesn't go far enough. Because not only will it provoke ""sueño"" in young people, it's also perfectly appropriate for helping middle-aged people and senior citizens doze off! The producers' goal seems to have been to suck the energy out of any song or singer that showed potential. Therefore, Alessandra, the cast's best singer, gets stuck with the forgettable ballad ""Momento,"" while the promising uptempo cut ""Llega La Vida"" gets assigned to karaoke-league vocalist Litzy. Future so-bad-they're-almost-good classics include Alessandra's attempt at Def Leppard-style arena rock on the tepid ""Jóvenes Como Tu,"" and Verónica Jaspeado yodeling ""amo-or"" on ""Pólvora Mojada."" Ironically, two tracks are credited to the entire group DKDA, but the title song ""DKDA"" is not one of them...?!"
4,very useful,This book is extremely useful both for absolute beginners and also for those who have already encountered and practised narratology. Bal's comprehensive theory of narrative is a precious tool for a better understanding of narrative texts and of other theories in the field of narratology.
3,"Informative, but esoteric","While I can't say that I disagree with the ideas in this book, Bal's writing style fails to engage all but the most ardent students of literary criticism. Unfortunately, as is the case with many feminist authors, Bal tries desperately to demonstrate that she is worthy of her place in academia. She does this by taking a fairly simple concept, the Formalist style of literary criticism, and describing it in laughably pretentious terms. Furthermore, the relative value of this type of analysis is, in reality, quite low. As such, I would only recommend this book to a serious student of literary analysis. Anyone else will quickly find themselves either lost or bored to tears."
3,Good baseline,This book is a required read to be on our school board and provides a good baseline for someone considering serving. It is also a fairly quick read.
5,A Wonderful Begining,"The first in Italian cartoonist Giardino's series about a Jewish boy growing up in Communist Prague introduces us to Jonas Finkel and his pleasant middle-class life in Prague. His professor father is arrested for allegedly being a counterrevolutionary, although the unstated truth is that he's the victim of unofficial state anti-Semitism. The book is at its best in showing Jonas and his mother gradually sliding into poverty while they try to penetrate the state beauracracy to learn of the father's whereabouts and sentence. When Jonas is not admitted to high school due to his father's alleged crimes, he enters the workforce and awkwardly encounters the stirrings of hormones. The art is done in the lovely realistic style I tend to associate with European cartoonists, with appropriately washed out coloring. It'll be great to see all the books together."
4,Rev. Review,Very good quality on exegetical insights as well as a fair overview of differing opinions.
5,A Review of Secrets of Fat -Free Kosher Cooking,"In ""The Secrets of Fat-Free Kosher Cooking"", Deborah Bernstein, M.D. provides us with a large variety of mouth watering, lowfat recipes which essentially are quite simple to assemble. In addition, the author clearly explains all recipes while giving the reader background information and amusing stories, relating to the importance of the recipe, and which also bring balance to the wonderful illustrations. Among other timely tidbits, the reader will also learn about the laws of Kashrus. To sum up, this recipe book is an attractive, compilation of facts, and pictures, that will find a wide and appreciative audience. A very laudable effort."
3,ok,its just about what they say it is.but dont tell you the back and sides are very thin that recess in the wall.part of the side stop moulding is not oak but a composite.as is the broad it self. also it has 2 metal sides for heat but not on the bottom.the oak front if your going to paint it is open grain.but all in all for the price its not to bad a solid 6 of 10
3,"Not classic Heep, but a strong hard rock album","Abominog was the first album recorded by the ""new"" version of Uriah Heep after guitarist Mick Box singlehandedly rebuilt the band following the 1980 collapse. This effort does not quite sound like the Heep albums of the eighties, being full of glam and bombast, but is a solid effort nonetheless if you like well-done and polished hard rock. Indeed, most of the material is strong and the songs rock really well. However, the absence of the departed Ken Hensley and the reliance on cover versions for four of the album's ten tracks turn some hardcore fans off, as does the cheesy album cover."
3,Uriah Heep - 'Abominog' (Essential),"Originally released in 1982, not bad for a reunion lp when most long time Uriah Heep fans had assumed they were washed up. Now that keyboardist John Sinclair and vocalist Peter Goalby were new members in the Heep rank, they seem to breathe new life into the band. Of course, guitarist Mick Box always does his chore well on ALL Heep releases. Tunes I liked more than I thought I would were ""Too Scared To Run"", ""Running All Night"", their Small Faces cover ""Tin Soldiers"" and the lp's single ""That's The Way It Is"". A decent album rock title, do check it out for yourself."
2,"Ok album, the first without the great Ken Hensley","Ok album from Mick Box & Co. after their restructuring due to Hensley's leaving and the dismal Conquest album. Peter Goalby is an OK singer, but he pales in comparison to David Byron. The songs are pretty average, the performances are decent, but the album lacks the heart of many of their previous albums. This album is were you realize how vital Hensleys songwriting was to this band. ""Thats The Way That It Is"" is pretty good though, and the cover is cool in a bizarre sort of way."
2,VERY FUN !,"The fun in this albun is the cover art! It shows a horrible red demon (or whatever, with teeth showing in anger, for the sake of nothing, because, when you listen the music and the lyrics in the album, it's all only hard-rock, with candid lyrics about love, etc (see the 4 covers, for example). Bizarre choice of cover art by guitarrist Mick Box. Maybe he wanted attention desperately!"
4,Rock & Blues Missing Link...,"The cover art hides the fact that this album is more on the rock side of the rockin' blooze genre. This album is primal- just freakin' choking with distortion and laced with dry drums and vocals. I find it beautiful, but I know that it sure ain't for everyone."
5,It was so good,I liked all the different stories. There were some stories from books that I had read before like one about Smog the dragon from The Hobbit. There were also some pretty funny dragon stories. Overall there was a nice mix of dragon stories. I highly recommend this book to kids from about age 8 and up.
4,The Book of Dragons,I bought this book for my 6 year old. He loves Dragons. This book has been wonderful. The pictures are great. Some of the stories are a little over his head but he has enjoyed having the other stories read to him. We are enjoying this book specifically devoted to dragons!
5,Great for students and preachers,"* Many authors suppose to write for scholars, pastors and laymen, yet few accomplish their goal. Hamilton succeeds. This commentary is of sufficient depth and technicality for scholars and students. The introduction in particular does a wonderful job of addressing theological themes within the book. One very useful feature, not usually found in scholarly OT commentaries, is a section on 'New Testament Appropriation"" at the conclusion of every few chapters. Hamilton also includes useful applicatory points and easy-to-read and understand chapter and section summaries. IMHO this is the best commentary on Genesis."
3,Not real relatable,My son is 6 1/2 and my daughter is 2 1/2. I bought this book on a rec from a friend. I was disappointed. It went right over my son's head. He couldn't have cared less. He is not to the stage that this book is directed towards. All he cares about is when he will see his Dad again and why can't his Dad and I get along. The answers to his questions weren't in this book. If he was a bit older like maybe older than 10 it may have helped a little.
5,Awesome,"I was listening to the Rock and Wrestling Radio Show one night and I heard this band on the Bonecrusher Countdown. They played ""Turn Me On Mr. Deadman"", which I instantly loved. This is an awesome CD and you will not regret buying it."
4,Ride With Me,"Great CD for the Road, however, be careful of those around you as yo will be laughing so hard your eyes will water."
2,Show me Pinette's Work anytime,I stumbled on John's work many years ago during an special he did on TV. Since then I have caught him at Comedy Clubs and on DVD and CD of course. He is a natural as well as being a very nice person. I have been back-stage twice to greet him and he is always gracious.As for funny? He's hilarious and hopefully you'll catch him at a club too. This CD in your car will help a long drive become a short drive...but watch out he's addictive!Joe Castronovo
5,This is the funniest CD in the world!,"I've listened to this CD about 30 times. The first time I heard I almost died of laughter! And the next 29 times have been just as funny. It's not the same with other comedians, the first time it's funny but that's it, but with John Pinette, it's funny every time. I want to hear more of John Pinette but he doesn't have any other CDs. What a shame. Anyhow, I recomend this CD to anyone. One thing though , don't listen to it in the car, you might crash.""This one Chinese buffet I went to, well I must say, the owner was kinda rude. He'd come out every hour!""With chinese accent: ""You hea fo awa! why you hea fo awa? You no come hea anymore!"""
4,Why would you edit this?,"I love John Pinette, he is hilarious, and this cd is one of my favorites. But the copy I received had been edited. It says that is has explicit lyrics, but my copy did not. It was only a few lines, but it was still very irritating, because some of those lines were what made the whole joke funny. I don't know why they would edit this cd because it's not like it's really filthy. I recommend this cd, but make sure you get the unedited version. It's better."
5,Very Funny,John Pinette is one of the funniest commedians that I have ever heard. The entire show keeps me entertained even the third or fourth time through. The subject material is also clean enough for just about any audience.
5,Let's Take the Fat Boy for a walk!,"Hilarious self-deprecating obsessions about food & obesity will leave you in tears. Every bit from the Grand Floridian buffet, to the water slide fiasco, to why John won't eat seaweed... you can listen to it over and over and it's STILL funny; in fact, I always find little moments I'd missed before because I was laughing so hard. Best of all, it's fresh, original material, and he doesn't need to lean on sex & bathrooom jokes like so many other lame jokesters... Don't download it - BUY it! Can't let the best comedian in years go starving, now can we? ;-)"
5,Very funny!,"This CD is very funny! I thoroughly enjoyed the material as there is no offensive language, just lots of laughs!"
1,"You need to see John, not just hear him.","I've got John's DVD ""I'm Stavin"" and my wife and I think it's great. I got his CD instead of the ""I say nay nay"" DVD because of the reviews here; but I can't see why the reviews are so wonderful.A major part of John's routine is how he looks, acts and reacts to the stories he tells.Hard to do in a CD.John apparently also has enough ""material"" for one show, and nothing new, so whether you get his two DVD's or a mixture of DVDs and CDs; most of the ""bits"" are the same.Save your money unless you are a really big Pinette fan."
2,Repetitive,"While some of his jokes are amusing, listening to fat jokes for an hour is boring. All of his material is about being fat and eating. Very shallow talent pool."
3,Confusion,"I purchased John Pinette's ""Show Me The Buffet"". I thought I was getting a DVD of a stage show and was disappointed when it was a CD. This needs to be made more clear on your site, so people know what they are getting."
2,I thought it was a DVD. My Bad,It's an OLD CD not a new DVD that I expected. I don't recall whether I didn't read it correctly or there wan't proper information to clarify what it was I was buying.Cranky and unhappy
1,Low Standard of Comedy,"I must disagree with most of the reviewers here, I found this CD to be filled with low-grade simple humour about little else than how fat this guy is... It's really not that funny, it's pretty much a continuous sequence of one-liners and scenarios (where the punchline, of course, is about how fat he is). Maybe this is niche humour or something, that overweight people would find funny, but if you want comedy that's both funny and makes you think a little bit too, try Dennis Miller, Woody Allen, George Carlin, Steven Wright, Robert Klein or Eddie Izzard (there are many others that I cannot think of)."
4,It Works!,It works as advertised. It's being used on a Dell Windows XP Pro laptop and we haven't had any problems with installation or use.
5,Works GREAT,"It has a large head, which means that I can de-fuzz my item quickly. But most importantly, it works GREAT. It removes what should be removed and leaves alone what should be left alone. This is especially great for knits, which sometimes are a little irregular on purpose, and you want only the fuzz removed, not the threads themselves. I'd definitely recommend this item. I can't say one bad thing about it."
4,Professional grade,Works faster and better than a small model from another manufacturer. I would recommend it.
2,Didn't work that well and made holes in my clothing,"After reading all the other positive reviews, I was expecting good things from this product. Not miracles, but a good product capable of doing solid work.I first tried it on a delicate black scarf that I was going to throw away anyway as it had so much fuzz and lint. It worked pretty well on this product. It didn't make the scarf look new, but it did make it presentable. However, it also made plenty of holes in the scarf.I then tried it on a mock turtleneck that was starting to get pills. I hoped that being thicker, the mock T could withstand the shaver. However, the shaver started making holes in my shirt before I quit to salvage what I could of my mock T. Furthermore, it did not remove the pills very well.Maybe I am not using the product correctly. But then again, it does not come with specific instructions...For a better product that won't ruin your garments, try the SWEATER STONE which is a CONSUMER REPORTS 'Best Buy.'"
4,awsome history,"we have been to YNP and gloried in its splendor. also read ""the big burn"" about the same time.we will never forget the men and our president who recognized the beauty and dangers of the wilderness and preserved it for us. God forgive us if we let it slip away to the users/takers of our society."
4,The Discovery of Yellowstone Park,"This book is well written and contains many facts that are often ommited from books written in the last few years. Even if you think you know ALL about Yellowstone, there are things written in this book that will bring you up short and make you realize that, perhaps, there IS more to learn about America's first National Park. A good book to have in your library."
1,"Reiterates dilemmas, but doesn't provide insightful answers","Very disappointing, no substance, mostly full of quotes from individuals who are not very illuminating either. If you just want to know that you are in good company with your indecision, this book if fine. If you would like it to provide you with answers (as the title suggests) or assist you with your decision, it's not worth your time or money."
2,Too Basic,"I was looking to read something that would really stimulate my thinking and allow me to think about this topic in a new way, with the hope that I could come to some answers for myself. What I got was a very cursory overview of many potentially relevant aspects of this topic with nothing I could really ""sink my teeth into."" To give you an idea about how basic the material is, I was able to read the whole thing in one sitting in bed one night before going to sleep. Overall not very useful and I would not buy this book again."
2,Interesting but lacks depth,"While this book contains a wide range of topics of interest to those considering parenthood, it doesn't cover these topics with very much detail. I would have found it more helpful if the stories of the women interviewed had been longer than a paragraph apiece. Overall, this book is useful in that it brings up many important issues for consideration, but in my opinion, it served only as a ""springboard"" for further research."
2,Not helpful,"This book simply states the questions I (and likely you, since you're reading this) are already asking yourself. Each page states a question like, ""Do I have enough energy for a kid?"" and then explains, ""You may not, or you may. Kids are tiring."" I understand that these questions are meant to give people things to consider, but for me, since I've already been considering them and not coming up with answers on my own, it wasn't a helpful book. I was hoping the book would help me answer these questions, not just write out the questions I'm already asking."
3,"Not much depth, but covers a lot of topics","There's not a lot of depth to this book, but it's good for picking up to read for a few minutes here and there. It's organized into sections, each with a series of questions. The ""answer"" to each question generally takes two pages and includes a couple of short quotes from women in various situations. There's no background info on the women, and the rest of the text is pretty short. Interesting, but not my first choice of books."
5,absorbing story,"My father first read this book to me when I was a child and I thoroughly enjoyed it. In those days, the 1960s, all small boys were fascinated by the wild west. I discovered a copy years later in a used book shop and reread it with equally great pleasure. Wellman is a sadly under-rated writer about the old west. In time I have read most of his work and have found both his novels and historical work well written and researched. Broncho Apache tells the tale of an Apache warrior who escaped from a train near St Louis in Illinois which was transporting his tribe to Florida in 1886. Over the next few months he made his way back to Arizona. After arriving home he wages a one-man war against the Americans, the Mexicans and the tame Apaches. There is nothing sentimental about this character yet Wellman writes about him with sympathy and understanding so that you care about what happens. For a good entertaining read I strongly recommend this book."
3,The song I wanted the most wasn't even on the soundtrack,"I saw the movie and got the soundtrack. What a great disappointment. In the movie there was a love sequence at night , on a beach , near a shack that track hollywood sunset ( I believe )was playing . In this track there were female vocals that were incredible (sounded a bit like marta sebestyen ) anyway these vocals never appearred on the soundtrack and really ticked me off. Anyone who knows the singer and the song, could you enter it in an article here. If that song was on the soundtrack I would have given it a five."
4,As interesting and esoteric as the movie was,"The first time I listened to this was mainly for ""The Perfect Drug"" by Nine Inch Nails but, after a while, I branched out and listened to the entire CD. The first few times I found it very odd. After a time of listening to it, I got into the jazzy parts (most of the CD, in fact.) It has become one of my favorite CDs; since, it didn't start out that way, I'll only give it four."
1,What a yawner,"David Lynch tries too hard to be clever in his contrived film, and this soundtrack mimics that vain attempt by piecing together cool acts but with second-rate, ""B-side"" tracks. Buy the individual albums and leave this one to the discount bins."
4,Superb,"This is,by far,one of the most compelling Soundtracks out there. I listened to it a year ago an I liked the music..I mean, it's Trent Renzor(NIN)..Manson,& Rammstein..enough said.But when i watched the movie recently,i was amazed and creeped for the music which I listened to as individual tracks, took a whole new meaning & shape in my head..so i went back to the album & listened once more..but this time,it gave me the creeps..I could relate every song to a certain time in the movie..and it becomes really freaky & creepy..so listen to this album on its own or accompanying the movie..either way, you're a winner!"
2,Best track is missing...,"I, like most other people who bought this sondtrack, was looking for a very specific song (the one playing during the ""love"" scene at the beach) but the track is not included. Unless you really like the rest of the soundtrack, then I wouldn't recommend it to other buyers. The song that you are probably looking for is ""Song to the Siren"" which has been covered by everyone from Robert Plant to The Chemical Brothers--but I believe the artist featured in the film is This Mortal Coil--you can save yourself the money and disappointment of purchasing the entire album and just buy that track."
4,Uneven but has some interesting tracks,"The Smashing Pumpkins' ""Eye"" is a completely electronic, sequenced track, like NIN and unlike the SP's, and very interesting - it's got an experimental sound but is very focused and sure of itself. It turns out to be the best track on the album. NIN's ""The Perfect Drug"" has an unique, experimental sound as well, but doesn't pull together quite right - it comes off as a poppy love song with grating background machinery noises. Bowie's ""Deranged"" is a decent song, but seems almost like ambient music - it feels empty. Rammstein's and Marilyn Manson's tracks are also fairly good, but they're B-side quality. Most of the rest of the album is the soundtrack, which has the same sort of moodiness as the singles. This is an offbeat collection of songs, probably uneven for most listeners - but that same experimental quality makes it captivating."
5,MUST BUY.,"Simply put, this is probably one of the best soundtracks ever put together. If you're into industrial music, or derivatives there of, Purchase."
3,Many weak links,"This could have been something really special. Instead Reznor gets to highlight a few great tracks (starting with the relatively too-strong several tracks) but fades into irrelevance before and throughout its second half. Sadly Badalamenti's showbiz-jazz, which makes up the majority of his entries, just don't stand up to repeated listens like we expect from his deeper textures. In the end, as if to blatantly wake listeners up from stupor, another NIN track which could have been a Downward Spiral outtake and the Bowie reprise remind us to forget a majority of mediocrity."
4,"great soundtrack, strange movie","This is a great soundtrack, especially for any industrial fans. This also the only CD where you can find the original version of NIN's ""Perfect Drug"", which is reason enough to get this album. You also have David Bowie, a great Lou Reed track(""Magic Moment""), two Marilyn Manson and Rammstein tracks, plus some music scores and Trent Reznor's instrumentals from the film."
3,The movie was much better,"Er...this isn't that good. It's not that the songs are bad, but they just don't go together the way a soundtrack should. And the Rammstein tracks are really sub-par. I don't quite get why 'This Magic Moment' was in there... Don't get me wrong, the CD has it's merits. 'The Perfect Drug' is a great song (and a cool video), Marilyn Manson's retake on 'I Put A Spell On You' was very cool, and the Smashing Pumpkins track is rather captivating (although it wears off for me). The various background bits from the movie are good but just don't gel together. I would only reccomend buying this if you don't have a friend who has it, in which case it is worth it just to hear some stuff you'll never hear anywhere else again. Otherwise, borrowing a friend's should be enough."
4,If you believe in serendipity and destiny...,"A romance story of two people from different worlds, connected by a father they both longed to have. Filled with inner conflicts and uncontrollable desires, the protagonist Boston-bred Derinda James must choose between the desire to avenge and the craving for passionate affection.If you believe in serendipity and destiny, you will probably like this novel. We all can relate to life gone wild and a plan turned the opposite. After all, life is fragile and there are so many shades of feelings. This western romance novel has the quality to capture its readers' hearts.Ms. Simmons has proven to be a conversational and skillful storyteller, perhaps due to her own personal triumph over childhood and adolescent adversity. The lifelike dialogues, surprising plots and fluidity are the strengths of this highly praised romance fiction. Readers will be tempted to finish this page-turner within one sitting."
5,My Favorite Neels Book!,"This one is my all time favorite Betty Neels book. Just read it. You'll like it. Yes, it is quite similar to all her others, but we like that! My favorite line from the book: ""You're as cross as two sticks."""
1,Not what I expected from other reviews,"I could not wait to get this hat form reading all of the reviews. BUT It is HUGE!!!! While I do like large sun hats for the beach, this one makes me chuckle it is so large. It looks ridiculous on. It also came to me with bent places along the rim. I have tried reshaping this hat & to get the bent places out, but it's still ridiculously large. I don't know how anyone can travel with this thing (by plane). I would recommend getting a hat that the rim is adjustable. I have a black one like that, & I love that feature!"
4,Not as soft as I had hoped it would be,"I do like the hat. It's definitely wide enough. It's was shipped, very well protected. It's pretty in color. My only issue is I had hoped it would be a little softer."
1,Too small for my big head and hair!,"I bought this hat a couple of days before going to the beach because I read the reviews on amazon, and most of them said how wonderfully surprised they were that the hat fit them because of their big head. The hat came the day before we left for beach, and didn't fit - too small! Bummer."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,this hat was massive. the actual head part was huge. if you try to tighten it with the string it makes like a muffin top which doesn't look good on anyone. i have a pretty big head and i was still swimming in it. because the head part is sooo large the hat falls well over u eyes and u cant see a thing. the floppiness is awkward. it doesn't sit right on the brim. also the material felt cheap and the wholes of the woven straw a huge. its a piece of junk. on top of that the seller charged a restocking fee. i ended up paying more for shipping and restocking then the item was even worth. veryyyyyyyyyyyyy disappointed.
2,A BIT LARGE,"Wanted a large hat for a cruise that I went on so thought this hat would be it. I was totally disappointed when I took it out of the box. It was HUGE! Too HUGE for me. I was going to return it but figured it would cost too much to return. Suggest when purchasing a product such as this you have it in hand. 8"" does not describe the actual size. Will wear it to cut the grass."
5,Hidden Gem,"This is a great band from the early '90's that was grossly overlooked. If blues/noise/rock is your bag, this album gets pretty deep. These guys should have gotten more recognition than they did."
2,Bit of a ramble,"There's some nuggets in there, I'm sure, but you may have to dig for them. It's an older book and the author takes his time getting to the point."
4,brad paisley christmas,Great Christmas music for the season. I would recommend this to all who love Christmas music for the holiday.
5,Brad Paisley makes me smile,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and was so please that it arrived so quickly AND was just what she wanted. I have to admit, I love it too."
5,Brad Paisley,This is a great christmas album. I will definitely buy other Brad Paisley CD's. I would recommend this CD to everybody.
2,"poor writing, excellent topic","This book had as much rythym as a train switchyard run by an epileptic. John DeLorean is cast as the ignored messiah, one who's reputation for rocking the boat is only countered by the results he achieved. Simple technical errors abound, leading one to wonder what other facts where not true. What is true is the basic premise: GM had the world by the ass, and thru arrogance and sheer inertia is suffocating under it's own weight. It is grim to read this, written in the mid 70's realising that half-wit Roger Smith was just around the corner..."
4,Must read for anyone interested in the domestic auto industry,"After cooperating with the author to write an honest account of his time at GM, John DeLorean tried to supress this book, perhaps because he feared it would impact his attempt to start his own company. The book is incendiary, frank and candid. It lays bare the suffocating bean counter culture that's all but killed the greatest manufacturing company the world had ever seen. But that's what happens when you ruthlessly subtract content and compromise quality in the name of next quarter's profits.Japanese car companies are generally run by engineers. Since the 1950s U.S. car companies have been helmed by MBAs. The industry's current situation has proved Mr. DeLorean correct in his judgements.I couldn't put this book down."
1,too small for stated weight,Our son is 17 lbs. and is almost 5 months old. The packaging says 15-22 lbs.(for the Large size) No way! I tried to attach the velcro pieces and it can only go half way around his little body and the velcro pieces can't attach. The concept is good but doesn't work. I ended up just going back to swaddling him with a large receiving blanket. If anyone knows of a better product for swaddling please comment on my review. Thanks.
5,The BEST,"This is the best swaddling device...I wrapped my son whenever he wanted to sleep and I didn't have to deal with extra sheets or anything. He couldn't unwrap himself,so I didn't have to worry about sheets going over his face. Excellent product that I think any mom could benefit from."
1,it is disappointedly bad for my baby,"The design is pretty narrow. My 3-4 months baby was far more under the pounds as the product described. The product tightened her so much that when she was in it she would cry. Unless you have a very small and quiet baby, otherwise it is not a wise choice."
2,Incorrect sizing information,"This gown was labeled as fits up to 3 months. When I received it, it was actually a size large. I had to return it and go buy one at a store since it was needed for a baby shower."
4,Works like a charm,"A great shortcut for the swaddle process. Of course your baby will not like it for the first 3 minutes, but after that and when combined with other soothing techniques, they will love you for it."
4,Worth it.,"These things are great! If you have a colicky baby (and most of us do to some extent) read ""the Happiest Baby on the Block"" and get the SwaddleMe baby wrap. Yes you can learn how to swaddle with a blanket, but these are SO much easier, in part because how many LARGE square blankets do you actually see out there (required for swaddling)?Only downside for us is that the velcro loop section wears out in about 2-3 weeks depending on usage levels. Not a huge problem, since the need for swaddling usually ends around 3 months, and they aren't expensive. It would also be nice to have the loop section larger, to accommodate longer skinny babies. Our son is a bit too long for the small, but WAAY to skinny for the Large."
3,¡¡¡Ä1g,"A few good rap songs by some of the Death Row inmates and a few horrible R&B; songs, I'm not a great R&B; fan but I like some of it and none on this cd.#1 - 10 (classic from Snoop Dogg & 2Pac)#2 - 7 (Lady of Rage)#3 - 3 (Danny Boy)#4 - 9 (Dat Nigga Daz Dillinger)#5 - 8.5 (2Pac)#6 - 8 (Nate Dogg)#7 - 8 (Snoop Dogg, 2Pac, Tray Deee, Soopafly, Bad Azz, Hershey Locc)#8 - 6 (Danny Boy)#9 - 1 (BGOTI)#10 - 8 (Snoop Dogg, Charlie Wilson, James DeBarge, Val Young)#11 - 8.5 (J-Flex & Storm)#12 - 6 (Storm)#13 - 8 (OFTB - Operation From The Bottom (Low MB, Flipside & Bustop - Watts Up))#14 - 1#15 - 2 (Anonymous)R.I.P.

2,Gridlock'd,"This soundtrack is one of the last reign of Death Row and 2pac before his death. Tracks 1-5 starts the soundtrack off well, but suddenly takes an ugly nosedive. I only recommend this only if you want some more 2pac songs and memoribilia. Danny Boy batting .500, by only hitting with ""It's Over Now."" On the lighter side Dat Nigga Daz had a chance to shine on ""Don't Try To Play Me Homey,"" a personal favoriate. A hidden secret on ""Life Is A Traffic Jam"" by Eight Mile Road has 2pac featured on it. R.I.P. 2pac!"
4,-,"Don't forget about #15. This song is so beautiful. It's Cody Chestnutt, I don't know why the album doesn't recognize him. The rest of the tracks are dope esp. #7. Buy this album!"
4,Picnic Time Cheese Set,This was a nice gift. Comes complete with the knives but the cheese slicer is great! Bought it as a gift for my sister-in-law.
5,Ty Beanie Baby,Great Granddaughter loved it and plays with it often. Holding up beautifully as we play with it and other Beanie Bears
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping that this was part of the Buddha Bar series; I should have known by the low price that it wasn't. Very uninspiring and bland. There are a few halfway decent songs on the third disc, but that's about it. Not particularly recommended."
5,The twins loved it!,"We bought this book for our slightly-more-than-2-year-old twin grandsons, and they loved it. At this age, they're more interested in identifying the pictures than following the story, but that's ok. There's something about the monkey image that is endlessly fascinating to them. And all two-year-olds love bunnies. Go for it!"
2,Disappointed - not Spanish edition,"I bought this for the Kindle iPad app because the title said it was the Spanish edition. Alas, the book was not in Spanish. I should have previewed it first."
1,Just an excerpt from FLIES A KITE.,"This is just a few pages cut out of the CURIOUS GEORGE FLIES A KITE BOOK. Kind of cheap way to market a new book. But if you like the 5 pages of FLIES A KITE that are about the bunny, you'll want this. At least each page is thick cardboard otherwise it would be only a pamphlet."
2,Bad behavior as George knows best,"What trouble can the cute little monkey get into today?Let's start by trespassing on someone's property, and opening an animal enclosure without permission. Then, let's turn a baby bunny loose in the woods so we can't find it. Uh-oh! I know, let's tie a string around the mother bunny's neck. Perhaps the threat of strangulation will force her to help us. Yea! She found her baby hiding under a tree (what a surprise), now let's pull it out BY THE TAIL.I won't deny that the illustrations are very cute. But what's the lesson here? Why can't Curious George send a positive message to kids?The Product Description mentions that this is ""Inspired by a vignette in Curious George Flies a Kite."" That means the scenes in Curious George and the Bunny are from the larger book, and were simply incorporated into the newly published board book in 1998. (Oddly, the ""B"" in the title is erroneously not capitalized on the front of the board book; it is correct on the spine.)"
2,Maybe it's not this toy -- maybe it's the OTHER toys,"I thought these would be fun for the grandkids. I heard that they wanted a ""steering wheel"" type toy. Got these.Interest lasted all of about 10 minutes. Never saw the toys again.Anyway... could be that all of their other toys are just better or more interesting.Most kids have way too much anyway... Take them to the museum. :):)"
3,Cartographia Madagascar map,Quite good. Smaller scale 1:2 million than International Travel Map and Globetrotter Travel Map.No geographic (coloured) contours
1,Could not get it to play!,A total waste of money. I could not get the video to play on my computer. I'm not sure why. I also could not download it to anything other than my Kindle. Waste of time and money.
2,Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence,"The guide was missing some stuff that it said it had. It was supposed to have maps of where to find the kerotans, but didn't. It didn't even talk about most of the hidden stuff in detail. I was disappointed."
2,Better check the internet,"This is the first game guide I get, and I'm a little disappointed, better look at the internet you'll find better tips."
1,Don't change what isn't broken,Thier were too many changes & additions to this game. The controls were very sketchy as was the terrain. The first two games were much better & had far more detailed level.
2,Not Convinced,"Maybe I'm missing something but all I saw was cherry-picking examples to support a hypothesis that Fibonacci sequences and their .618 ratios are fundamentally related to human behaviors including the stock market. I understand there are thousands of guys analyzing previous trends claiming to have found the Holy Grail; statistically a portion will forecast correctly and therefore convince themselves the're on to something. As a neuroscientist interested in certain aspects of group dynamics, I found the psychology parts weak. Again, the author quotes from mostly ambitious/famous scientists claiming to be able to distill complex scientific problems with a clever quip. I don't feel confident enough to completely discount the hypothesis but I'm at least 61.8% sure you can pass this book up."
2,The Dutch Seaborne Empire,"Found this book difficult to read and a bit deceiving in its contents. From the comments on the cover and the introduction, I was expecting at least in part a chronological history of the period. Although filled with facts, you never get a good sense of the big picture. For instance the first chapter is entitled ""The Eighty Years War"". But after reading it I hadn't learned what countries fought the war, where it was fought, or who won and who lost. I think the author presumed that this all was common knowledge and he didn't have to insult us with these basic facts. So if you want a general overview of this period of Dutch history go elsewhere. If you already have a grasp of the period, but just need more meat on the bones, this may be a suitable book."
3,"Pretty, but...","The book's strength is its beautiful, abundant illustrations; its weakness is the text. Reading through the book is not nearly as enjoyable as simply looking at the pictures: Some of the illustrations are not discussed in the text, and the text often refers to works of art not pictured in the book.Another weakness of the text is its frequently dumbed-down tone and the shallow treatment given many of the subjects in its survey. The text and picture captions are also riddled with typographical and grammatical errors.Despite the flaws in the text, however, the photographs of classical art are lovely, and the book is certainly worth browsing through."
4,"Very helpful book, with lots of examples and checklists.","I enjoyed the photos of example newsletters, all in different formats. It really got the ideas floating around in my mind. The interview questions and checklists were helpful also. This book really shows how unique a newsletter can be, and I would recommend it to anyone dabbling with the idea of a family publication. I think the original price is a teeny bit high, but the quality of the material is also!"
3,Not as bad as some think,"At first play, Galleon looks like an older title with amazing effects. One has to remember that Galleon has been sailing the 7 seas in Europe for the past year. Thankfully, it has finally landed at our ports and graced us with an amazing action/adventure title that lives up to the hype.I try not to let reviews of games skew my enjoyability, especially if it's a genre I like. Galleon's gruelling, unavoidable tutorial is a tad too painful, but once you're into the story and the action, you're there to stay.I crave games that leave you with a feeling of satisfaction, and Galleon does just that. My moments of guilty pleasure in this game were when I saw the amazing wind effects on characters, their clothes, and their movement; when I got the hang of swimming; when I mastered the combo moves to earn enough fighting points to pull a really sweet move."
4,Can't beat the price,"I purchased this to replace the section from my muffler back on a '90 ford bronco. It is 3"" stainless steel and mandrel bent to fit over the axle with no issues. This fit my bronco surprisingly well considering it's ""universal."" Welding/metal work required.Pros: Price, stainless steel, 3"", mandrel bends, free shipping!Cons: Shipped wrapped in black plastic, one end got dented during shipping but it didn't affect anything.For this price, you can't go wrong! ($52.64 with free shipping at time of purchase)."
3,This book lacked the quality that was expected,"When I picked this book up, I expected to read a book written by someone with a graduate degree. What I actually read was a third-grade-style report. There were incorrect grammatical usages and shady Artificial Intelligence applications."
5,Permission plus!,"Finally! Permission to relax and enjoy with real suggestions for keeping priorities clear, making good choices and creating space in the day, week, month to really DO things with the kids and the family. I love it! With summer plans taking control of my family's life, I discovered Ms. Doe's suggestions just in time. Now our summer will be full (busy) but enjoyable and rewarding (balanced). We all sat down and read portions together and used Ms. Doe's strategies and ideas to REALLY plan and think about our summer! Thanks to her, we look forward to a fun, new and exciting vacation season and the kids will honestly have something to talk about when they return to school in the fall! I will too!"
5,Mimi helps little miracles happen.,"This book pushes past the ""yes, but's"" so gently, it doesn't hurt a bit. Fresh perspectives about how to interpret what is going on and practical suggestions about things to do (and not do), make this a virtual parent's handbook for sanity.As a psychotherapist and author (Embracing Fear, HarperSanFrancisco 2002) I have made good use of two contrasting metaphors for parenting that have always made sense to me. One is that children are clay and parents sculptors, assigned the job of molding the clay into what they believe is best. The other metaphor is that children are seeds, and parents gardeners, with the job of caring for the enviornment surrounding the seeds so that they can grow into whatever they are meant to be. Mimi Doe is a master gardener with a wonderful ability to teach other gardeners."
5,I'm busy...now I have ideas to be more balanced,"As a working mother of three I am grateful for the honesty and real ideas in this lovely book. My favorite so far is the chapter on guilt...boy did that help me stop feeling bad and start taking action.I also appreciated the resources in this book and have followed up by gettng a number of books and going to some web sites.All in all I recommend this as a way to get your life together, love your kids more, and just be a better person."
5,AMAZING BOOK for your family,"Wow! This is my Bible for creating balance, rituals and meaning in my family life. I love the month by month format. Great for families with kids at all ages. I buy this book for girlfriends with families. I would love to have a book club or group that meets once a month to support each other and their families using ideas from this book."
2,Not very engaging,"I took a chance on this book based on the recommendations and I was not impressed. The book is simply page after page of feel-good statements with no real backing. The main gist of the book is that the universe thinks ""You Rock!"" and just wants to let you know this in multiple different ways. If you like Mike Dooley or books written in the style of ""statement a day"" calendars then this book might be for you, otherwise I don't suggest it."
4,Pick Me Up,"This is a wonderful little book to have laying around. Full of ""pick me up"" anecdotes for life."
2,Really?,"I bought ""Notes"" because the author figured prominently in ""The Secret"". But really, the book's not worth it. Can't believe it ended up getting published."
3,Notes from the Universe,"This was a pretty good book. I think I would have rated it higher if I did not expect more. I have listened to his books in the past and I think I had expected better. From a 1 to 10, I would rate this book 6.5. Also, I think this is a book you should listen to more than once."
5,Connection,"I love Notes from the Universe. I love that I've downloaded the Kindle version. Inspirational and HUMOROUS, Notes from the Universe helps put things into perspective and frequently bring a smile to my face and oftentimes a little laugh. In the way we live today, some moments it's hard to get connected, Notes from the Universe helps me do just that - quick, simple and quirky."
5,Notes From The Universe--Awesome,"Listening to these ""notes"" from the universe while driving is a truly enlightening experience...It reminds me of the way the spiritual universe and its material manisfestations operate.....Highly recommended for those seeking and remembering...."
2,If you want to read the TRUE story...,"Read""The Long Way Home - Revised Edition""by Ed Dover. It is the true story of this little-known historical event. If you're interested in a factual, historical account, and especially if you are interested in the Boeing B-314 or the Pan Am Clippers in general, you will enjoy Mr. Dover's book. It is obvious he has gone to great lengths to research the details of this true story, including interviewing some of the actual participants. Historical fiction is fine, but an author of fiction (especially a fictionalized account of an actual event, in which the actual participants are mentioned by name and included in the plot) should never mislead his readers into believing his story is factual."
4,Exciting adventure about a historic time,"Mr. Flynn has captured the essence of a flying adventure. His descriptions of flying situations and insight into the thought processes of the flight crew brought this war time drama to life. Anyone that has flown and had the opportunity to look inside the cockpit, must wonder about the people that fly these wonderful machines. Mr. Flynn takes us inside their heads. His storyline of capturing a Clipper by the Japanese would have influenced the outcome of WWII. This was an exciting and very well written page turner."
4,Excellent adventure story WW11,I thought this was an exciting fictional story based on the real historical flight of the Pan Am Clipper to escape from the Japanese in the Far East after their attack on Pearl Harbor. It would make a great movie a la Harrison Ford genre.
4,One of WW2's most amazing aviation adventures!,"This story begs to be made into a motion picture. The story of a handful of American men beating the odds (and the Japs) in returning their amphibian aircraft back to the states via the long route... around the world!The editing, or lack thereof, is the worst I have ever red (intentionally mis-spelled). That flaw is all that causes my rating not to receive 5 stars. ENJOY."
2,Had potential for a great story; sorry it missed the mark.,"Given the exploit of the crew/passengers, this could have been a great story, but it was related in a pedestrian manner with terrible editing: grammatik would have sorted out much of this. When the end of the story is foretold, one must build suspense and the author didn't do this for me. And for a story of a 30,000 mile flight the maps (no, not maps: THE map) was a disgrace."
4,Massive Typos and Errors Don't Spoil a Good Yarn,"While this book must have been published without benefit of an editor or proofreader, and some of the author's prose is amateurish, it's a good story. I am about two-thirds of the way through the book as I write this, and would gladly recommend it, with a warning about the errors and typos. Apparently a few people in the film industry thought enough of it to schedule it for production as a motion picture for 2008, according to the Internet Movie Database. The story is based on real events, and a large flying boat did indeed make its escape as described. Of course, the Indiana Jones style characters and their adventures are the author's creation. I hope they do make the film. I think it could turn out to be a delight."
3,Good Buy,It arrived quickly but it was not the battery that I ordered. It was a battery charger. I called the phone number on the invoice they were very polite and said that they would send me a battery 2nd day air. I got in in 2 days and they enclosed a camera case and labels to send the charger back.
4,Not too shabby,"I got this TV + a dvd/surround sound system for $1000 at a local retailer on a special promotion. Overall, its a pretty quality set but probably not the leader in LCD TV's. If I were going to spend $1800 I would probably look into a Samsung or Sony. Its pretty simple to navigate through menu's and customize the picture to your liking. I think it is a great set for $1000 but I probably would not have purchased it for the current price of $1800."
2,"OK for a quick reference book, but that's it","If you don't know a lot about stored procedures, this book is not for you. It is a really small book (only about 200 pages). The explanations of the code is not very understandable. After learning more about stored procedures from other books like the ""programming with SQL Server 2000 (I think it is a Microsoft book, sorry I couldn't give more info about the book), and ""SQL Server 2000 Stored Procedure & XML"" (ISBN: 0-07-222896-2), the best use I can find for this book is quick reference book.It lacks the depth to completely cover stored procedures for a person that is learning."
4,First Time with Kate,"This was my first time reading a Kate Millholland novel. I am an avid mystery/courtroom drama fan and was very pleased with this book. I find the Kate Millholland character intelligent, funny and quite stubborn (a quality I admire.) All the characters are well developed, the plot is intriguing and keeps the book moving along at a nice pace. The humorous observations of Kate Millholland give the book a light-hearted feel and make it an easy read. I enjoyed it enough to order other books from this series."
2,"Well-written, But Seriously Flawed","Has anyone else noticed that this book has virtually no ending? On one page our heroine is in dire peril, and the chapter concludes with a cliffhanger. On the next page, everything is fine, and the book ends about fifty words later with no explanation. I couldn't believe it. I read the last two pages a half dozen times hoping I'd missed something. I even checked the page numbers to see if some of them had been accidently omitted. What a disappointment! The plot was reasonably interesting, although Kate's vast wealth with her Judith Lieber bags and one-of-a-kind furniture was tiresome, but the ending...probably the worst I've ever read in a mystery."
2,come on...,"this is probably the most unoriginal cd i heard in a long time. i mean they entirely sound like powerman 5000, and pm5k tries to imitate white zombie themselves. the first time i heard ""turn me on mr. deadman"" i really thought it was powerman. pure unoriginality"
3,POWERMAN 500,"ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS CROSS OFF THE NAME AND GIVE IT TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT MUSIC AND SAY IT IS A NEW POWERMAN 500 ALBUM AND THEY WILL BELIEVE YOU. I WAS PRETTY MUCH HALF A SLEEP WHILE LISTININ' TO IT. THE ONLY SONGS THAT GOT MY ATTENTION WAS ""TURN ME ON MR. DEADMAN"" ""REVOLUTION MAN"" AND ""TRIP WITH JESUS"" THAT WAS PRETY MUCH ALL. THE REASON I GOT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS 10 BUCKS... SO IT WASN'T THAT BAD. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF SMALLER BANDS WHO SOUND LIKE BIG BANDS... THEN BY ALL MEANS GET THIS ALBUM... BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKIN FOR SOMETHIN' ORIGIONAL LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE."
2,Mediocre,"Just another metal release... Actually, the only recent metal album I can remember liking was Godsmack's debut. Anyways, the music isn't that great and the lyrics don't extend far beyond ""life /I hate you"" yadda yadda yadda."
4,coporate music ...[stinks]!,"Union Underground...After hearing ""Turn Me On Mr Deadman"" on Kerrang, i was hooked. This band are brilliant, but don't u think they sound ever-so-slightly like Powerman 5000??? who cares though?? This is a really good record to buy and a strongly reccomend it!"
5,"Finally, some original rock","in a world where bands like limp bizkit take rule, it is amazing that a band would finally come out and bring back rock, old fashioned headbanging rock this c.d. is completely amazing. one listen and you are hooked.don't get me wrong, i love bands like slipknot and mudvayne, but this is a break from the everyday heavy metalThis gets my seal of approval.-FM"
3,3 and a 1/2 stars,"This isn't that good of an album. It's just that the good tracks seem to be really good, but theirs only like 4 of those. The guitar is that of Powerman 5000, and they definetaly don't have their own sound. They are kind of like a Texas raised satanic Metallica. Standout tracks are Drivel, South Texas Deathride, Turn Me on Mr Deadman, and Killing the Fly."
4,"a potent, rocking, major label debut....","Being from San Antonio, The Union Underground is a local band to me. It is awesome to know that someone with actual talent and heaviness is at last from ""San Antone."" If you are fans of bands like Alice in Chains and Powerman 5000, you would be wise to check this album out. Their sound is Alice in Chains with more effects and Powerman 5000 with tighter vocals. Do not base the album on the lead single, ""Turn me on, Mr. Deadman,"" as the rest of the CD is heavier. Songs that I recommend are ""South Texas Deathride,"" ""Until you Crack,"" and ""Revolution Man."" Overall, Union Underground is a much needed shot in the arm to metal that is totally devoid of any rap influences."
3,Decent Debut CD,"Took a chance on this cd w/o sampling first because it was cheap. I saw that Ulrich Wild(Static X) produced a couple of the songs so I thought it had to be decent. The guitars have plenty of distortion and chunkiness, but could use more on each song. Vocals are melodic and are similar to Stone Temple Pilots, Step Kings, and even a hint of Powerman 5000. Overall, not a bad cd starting out."
4,not your average nu-metal,"First of all I would like to say nobody knows UU in Belgium. Poeple over here don't even know powerman 5000 and godsmack. So it was quite a shock for me when I found this in the store (I knew UU from amazon.com) But the bad thing was that I had to pay 21 dollars for a half hour of music. Well it was worth the money that's for sure. Because I haven't heard Powerman 5000 I think UU is original sounding. A great mix of Industrial, Southern rock, grunge and a little touch of spookycore. I'd recommend this to any real nu-metalfan (not the papa roach, linkin park and staindfreaks)"
3,Decent..but they need to find their own sound,"In all respects this isn't a bid c.d.,but Unio Underground borrows the sound of too many different artist and fails to defint their own sound. The single Turn me on Mr. Deadman is a sweet song,but when I heard it on the radio I thougt (I didn't know Powerman 5000 had a new song). And they also seem to borrow from Marilyn Manson ,espesialy noticable on the song Drivel. I mean as far as metal goes they're not bad,there's just better and more origional artist. They have the talent now they need to find the origionality to back it. So I can't wait to hear their future efforts to see if they ever find their own sound."
1,A Powerman Wannabe,Its another band like Powerman 5000. They all look the same and sound the same. They are all like tredy metal now a days. But if you like powerman 5000 buy the cd. you will like it. I saw them live and they do put on a good show but i just don't like powerman 5000. Buy it and see for yourself.
2,Need originality,"They have catchy music, but none of it is really their own. Their first single ""Turn me on Mr Deadman"" sounds nearly exactly like Powerman 5000 songs. Their newer, better single, ""Revolution Man"" does sound good, except the guitar riff is stolen directly from Rage Against the Machine. And even then their music doesn't have any real stand out quality. Union Underground has potentiol, they just need to come up with their own sounds. My advice would be to wait for their next album and see if they can come up with good music of their own."
5,SO. TEX. REPRESENT!,"ok, i'm from san antonio and it's about time someone from SA makes it big, these guys rock. i don't think they sound like powerman, but that's just me, the older tracks on the album sound like AIC or STP, but the newer ones, ""...deadman"" and ""so. tex. deathride"" are much harder. these 2 songs sound kinda like pm5k, but more like godsmack. bottom line, this is a cd, unlike most cd's out there, that's good from start to finish!"
3,Mr. DEAD MAN!!!!!,"Wow, this is a very odd CD. Some songs are laid back, and others are right in your face. It does not even sound like the same singer in all the songs. It is a real good CD. The guy that said it sounded like STP was right!"
2,One of the Worst Debuts of 2000....,"I'm sorry, but these guys sound way too much like Powerman 5000 who, in turn, sound way too much like White Zombie. The riffs are pretty much identical to PM5K's, the singer sound exactly the same, and the lyrics are just as nonsensical. I will say this, however, these guys produced their record very well. The clarity of the cd's amazing, but nothing else is..."
3,It wasn't bad..a twist of some older sound with some new....,I just got this cd yesterday and my brother and i started to listen to it and we decided that they were a pretty tight band but on some of their songs they reminded me of powerman 5000. but on other cuts they had a distinct sound of their own and alot of the guitar rifts reminded me of an older Korn which i liked..not bad for a debut album just dump the whole powerman 5000 it ain't working for you
4,Funky Texas Metal?,I can tell I missed something at the turn of the millinea.This is a funky yet likable blend of metal and dare I say Club music?It makes you groove while you listen to it thats for sure.
4,A hard rock classic,"For about three months this cd, along with Primer 55's Intro to Meyhem, were just about all I listened to out of a huge cd collection. The remarkable thing about this album is how quickly it came to dominate my playlists. Union Undergound sounds like a younger, hipper Rob Zombie. It is true that there are weak spots on this CD and that the best tracks are the first three, but most of the rest of them still rank up there with the best of the genre. The lyrics are pretty contrived but if you're anything like me and own a lot of this kind of music, you've grown fairly jaded to most lyrics anyway and it won't bother you. This is pure head-banging fun. Definitely pick it up if you like Zombie and its ilk."
3,Good book for 'porch' reading...,"This book is good if you're taking a break, sitting on the porch with an iced tea. Doesn't tax the brain...some of the stories are too simplistic and not very interesting but I don't think it's aiming for ""literature."" It's a book that probably won't be headed for a spot your bookshelf when you're done reading it but instead will go straight to the library book sale. Which is okay if a light read is all you want."
4,GET THIS FOR VIVIAN VEE'S HEARTBEAT(before it's OOP),"This CD is the only place (that I know of) that you will find a NON-MIXED version of Vivian Vee's hit ""Heartbeat (1,2,3)"". Good quality sound from the great ZYX label. Den Harrow's ""Don't Break My Heart"", Albert One's ""Hopes & Dreams"" (better quality than his ""Best Of"" CD) and Vivian Vee's song are worth the price of this CD alone. Unfortunately, like most of the 80's Hi-NRG/Italo-Disco compilations, once they sell out they are no longer in production/OOP, so get it while you can."
4,"typical of italo disco, this c.d. is mediocre",There are one or two good renditions on this cd. There is also a few songs which are discordant and somewhat painful to listen to.
5,Must-hear jazz piano by an underrated master.,"""Just Friends"" marks Martial Solal's long-overdue return to the trio format - and the result is one of the finest jazz piano records I've heard in a long time. Superbly backed by Paul Motian on drums and Gary Peacock on bass, Solal at seventy plays with the creativity and chops of a man half his age. There is not a cliché in sight, not one moment's indecisiveness. His version of the title tune fairly bursts with energy and inventiveness, breathing new life into a much-abused warhorse, while the other pieces on the CD are all on the same outstanding level. If you are at all into jazz piano, this is a recording you cannot afford to miss."
2,Thin and cheap,"This item may look plush in the picture, but it's very thin and very cheap - wouldn't keep your pet warm in a cool breeze, let alone a cold wind."
4,Highly technical and informative.,"This book, beyond a doubt, has all of the information the serious bonsai artist needs to know. A friend gave me this book when I first expressed an interest in bonsai, and it succeeded in intimidating me. The authors provide very thorough details about creating bonsai, and take it to the level of science rather than art. However, it is because of this high degree of detail that I was struck with how serious the art really can be. I find it unfortunate that it is currently out of print, since it does cover bonsai in such detail. I would tend to recommend Japanese Art of Miniature Trees and Landscapes to the person who is quite dedicated to pursuing the art, and would not recommend it to a person with a more casual interest."
3,Soft Fragrance,"The cologne has a nice smell; however, it's a soft fragrance. It does not last as long as other colognes. I use it mostly for the office."
5,Have a Cigar,"Excellent book. Beardslee depicts his characters so expertly that they are instantly familiar and help drive an extraordinary story line. The book starts of a very sad experience, but through humor and recollection each page brings smiles and laughter."
4,Excellent insider view,"As a former IBMer this book brought back many memories of the ""IBM Way"", good and not so good."
2,Mostly a nicely crafted rehash of the episode,Sorry it didn't have anything radically new to tell. It could have had more dialogue.....it could have told us something. Sadly it didn't. there is better free fanfic out there.
3,Shop around,"These are great lights. I have 2, and just ordered 4 more because I love them so much. Even my husband likes them - and it takes a LOT for him to notice anything in my garden. HOWEVER, you can find them cheaper elsewhere. I paid $8.95 for each one of mine, and they are the exact same item."
4,Does the job...,"I was looking for a Non-GMO Soy Protein and this is a good one. I mix it with a Rice Protein. The Vanilla Flavor is subtle, but comes through. Wish it came in a larger size..."
4,Polly Pocket Advent Calendar,I bought this for my 4yr old this year. She absolutely loves it. Every morning she gets up and goes to open the next door. We are also using it to count down the days til her brother comes to see her too.
4,Good for Polly Pocket Fans,"I bought this Polly Pocket Advent Calendar for my 6 year old daughter this year. I didn't want to pay a ton of money for an advent calendar since Christmas was just around the corner. The price was just about what I wanted to pay for this. If you've dealt with Polly Pockets before, you know the material used for the clothing is sometimes a bit thin and can break if stretched too much.My daughter was very excited to get it and couldn't wait for December 1 to come. She's been opening it every day and loves every little piece of outfit that comes out, whether it's a top or a pair of shoes. There are 24 different parts of several outfits. 1 day will be a top, the next a skirt, the next a pair of shoes and so on. It does come with a Polly Pocket doll so she can dress it up every day. So far it seems worth the money and the excitement and fun my daughter is getting out of it is priceless."
4,gift,What I can say. It brings a little Christmas tradition into a little girls life. She did get a bit impatient to get a whole outfit. But that is part of the learning process.
1,Lopsided interpretation,"I thought this book would be enlightening about the gay journey of an individual or individuals. It was far from that. Though this author is a professional, whether highly acclaimed or not, he made a lot of misrepresentations (I FEEL). Yes, I understand that the book represented many of his clients' journey into accepting their sexuality and validation issues as a gay man in society. This author is a professional in his field respectively, BUT he somehow made tragic mistake of categorizing and making broad generalizations that doesn't reflect many gay men. If he had possibly researched and interview people not his clients, he would have probably been successful covering a wide array of journeys that would cover the spectrum of many men's journey into their homosexuality. It made me angry and I eventually had to stop reading this book"
2,promoting the stereotypes,"While the author is thorough in exploring his worldview, it was difficult to relate to. In this world, there are only gay and straight people, strongly defined by their jobs, and at some point ""wildly successful"" in some sort of capitalist pursuit. I suspect that the author is limiting his worldview to the men who can afford his therapy or would choose to pursue therapy, the cost of which, I'm guessing, excludes variety and the type of person who spend thousands of dollars to pursue the lack of meaning in their own ""fabulous"" lives. The author also tips his hat the limitations of stereotypes and then dives right in and reinforces every gay stereotype there is. Not being a ""fabulous"" gay man who has never been wildly successful, it's a stretch for me to find myself, or anything of value on a personal level, in this book."
5,"EVERY ONE should read this-Parents, Straight types, fiends of a gay person and gay",The author nails it in this most amazing well told story. This book will bring lite and understanding to all who read it and will no doubt change the way you think and help you to truly understanding the struggle and personality's of those living the gay life. I wish I read it when it first came out. Pleas do yourself the favor of reading this book you will be a better understanding person of yourself and others.
5,A can not put down this type of book,"I bought this book and have to say my only complaint is I lost sleep because it was so hard to put the book down. I would tell myself, ""I will read just a couple more pages then go to sleep."" I found this book to be one of the best books that I have ever read on this type of subject.If you are searching for a good book to read and learn at the same time, purchase this book."
4,Very Helpful Book,"This book really helped me understand myself better, and I know it has strengthened my current relationship too."
2,"Some Truths, Mostly Superficial","If you experienced the gay lifesyle as a skinny twink, enjoying the night life, drugs, alcohol and circut parties - this is for you. For the rest of us, it is very superficial and barely touches the reality or complexities of deep gay relationships. It also does not address bi lives or any real help to analyze heterosexual activity of men who may identify as gay or bi. In all, it's an interesting read but too superficial to make a real difference in building and maintaining a strong relationship."
5,Amazing tale of strength and courage,"This book was an amazing story of strength, courage and healing. I find it hard to believe that some reviewers commented on grammatical errors or the length of the book. Did they NOT read this heart-wrenching story? From what I know about Kathryn Clarke, this book is largely based on her personal experiences and is semi-autobiographical. Truth is often stranger than fiction. ""Annie"" is a young woman who is a survivor of abuse who displays amazing intelligence, faith and determination. The cycle of abuse is often difficult for others to understand if they are not engulfed in that situation. This author does an incredible job of giving the reader insight into how and why someone can get caught up in the pain and dangerous pattern of abuse. She also gives HOPE to anyone in a similar situation. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"
3,Decent,"I was a bit disappointed because the book was not in as good of condition as described. However, being I didn't pay much for it, I am not too upset. But I received it fast, so that was awesome!=0)"
2,Disappointing/Unrealistic Ending & Needs Editing,"I work in the field of domestic violence. I was asked to read this book and give my input as to whether we should consider introducing it into our school system. I thought the first three-quarters of the book were realistic and true to life. However, the last quarter was a major disappointment and gives an unrealistic resolution to domestic violence. The ending seemed like either the author got tired and wanted a quick ending or wanted some unrealistic, romantic stuff to draw readers. I think she did a disservice with a potentially good book. Additionally, it's hard to respect a book that's full of grammatical errors."
2,"This ""Better"" Is Far From His Best","It's such a shame to see the trajectory with which Jon Secada's once promising career has taken. His last album, probably his best, all but bombed underneath the massive lack of marketing, and this album has met a similar fate, though deservedly so. This is by far his weakest effort, full of sappy adult contemporary ballads that not even his great voice can save. The record moves at a snail's pace, with the occasional uptempo number thrown in. Overall, a wasted effort from someone clearly wasting his vast talent."
5,Jon Secada Rules!!,"I loved this CD! Jon has a very nice voice. My favorite song on this album was track number 5. ""There's no sunshine any more."" I didn't like the song ""Papi"" that much, but other than that, all the songs rocked! I love you Jon!"
2,Misleading Information,"The author repeats the old baloney about Jack Johnson chasing Tommy Burns to Australia. Read Dan McCaffery's more accurate account of these events in his bio Tommy Burns: Canada's Unknown World Heavyweight Champion.Also, he brings up Jeffries' mythical defence against a pug named Finnegan. If that goes down as a title defence, then so do Burns' two KOs in one night in sunny California."
1,No Advice on Weaning,"I bought this book before my son was born because I'd read that it is very important to have a good nursing manual. We thankfully received lots of support from the hospital and pediatrician, so the first time I really needed the advice in here was when I decided to wean him at seven months. Guess what? No information! This was basically another breastfeeding commercial and implied that if I weaned my child before 2 years, I was a horrible parent.Look, bottom line is it would be nice if this book could simply serve the function of giving you much needed information about breastfeeding. Part of the journey is ending the breastfeeding relationship, and I think it's a huge oversight that weaning isn't discussed in detail. We get advice from enough sources as it is. Everyone has an opinion; I don't think it's right for a reference material to have one too."
3,Unknown,I only gave this a 3 star because I only skimmed it. I had received another book that answered all my questions. But it seems to have a lot of the information that a lot of other breastfeeding books have.
2,"Be aware, don't spoil your kid","While this book provides useful tips and encouragements for nursing moms, I found the author quite single minded on what is the right way to feed the baby and not always clear on what's her personal opinion vs. what's well adopted or proven. My advice is that this is a book worth reading, but don't use it as the only guidance for feeding your child.If you don't want a child who stays in your bed for a long long time or who grows up to believe crying is the way to get attention and whatever she wants whenever she wants it, and if you'd like to bring a happy kid into your life rather than turning yours upside down, go read other books and get second opinions elsewhere."
1,Irresponsible Book for New Moms,"Huggins is a hippocrite and writes a book that is completely irresponsible. This book does little to provide guidance to a new nursing mom. Rather it makes you feel guilty, helpless and like a failure. I was a successful nursing mom for 14 months despite this book. For the birth of my second child, I did myself a favor and used it for a coaster for my water cup while I nursed my baby.Do yourself a favor and get the AAP or the Good Housekeeping books instead."
5,Great book!,"From all the books I've seen available on breastfeeding, I feel this one is the best and most informative. This was the only book I needed for getting all the facts and info on breastfeeding."
4,useful,Contains helpful information. I bought it to learn how to heal my sore nipples and other information like that. I found it helpful but could be better
4,Excellent book,I am expecting my first baby soon and I am enjoying this book. It is informative and useful without being too overwhelming. It covers various holds for nursing the baby and different problems that may arise. I will keep this next to me while I begin nursing.
5,"There is a reason it is titled ""companion""","This book was very helpful with nursing issues. Other books devote a chapter or a few pages to nursing, this is a whole book! I keep it on my end table where I nurse and refer to it all the time. Great buy."
5,imforative,Very imformative. Helped me out alot as a new mother dealing with a micr preemie. How to store the milk etc.
4,Good book to have in your pregnancy library.,"Hi! 8 years ago, my dad surprised me with this book and 3 others for my first pregnancy. I was trying to figure out if it was worth it or not to breastfeed. I was going to college, and my husband travels for a living. Needless to say, I went with breastfeeding. This book has come in handy, as we have run the gamot of problems. Each child had their own problem regarding breastfeeding, and instead of getting easier, each child was more of a challenge. We would look up feeding positions, spit-up, thrush, medications to use, mastitis, buying a breast pump...the whole lot. This has been a great reference book throughout my other 3 pregnancies. I have thrown out all but 4 books, and this is one of the 4. :D Also, I buy this, a pregnancy journal and the first Baby Blues collection for each of my pregnant friends for their first baby. :D Hope this helps a little!"
3,It's OK,"I've read ""The womanly art of breastfeeding"" by La Leche League International (an old edition) and although ""The nursing mother's companion"" had some good overall information the book by LLL seems to be much more involved in the details of breastfeeding and goes to great lengths to cover just about everthing you can expect with breasfeeding. I would recommend ""The nursing mother's companion"" maybe as a recap if you're a mother with nursing experience but would definitly go with the LLL book (the latest edition)for first time moms as I feel this book is much more comprehensive."
3,A Little Outdated,"I am a first-time mom with a 5-month old daughter. I've been reading this book since I first had my baby and a lot of the information has been very helpful. There are a lot of things about the science of nursing that will never change. But there is a lot that is out-dated. The book also tends more toward the touchy-feely, all-you-can-eat buffet/on demand, toddler/young child nursing-type style. I am a working mother and was more looking for something with good informtion about general nursing but also guidance on feeding schedules, weaning at a normal age (around 1 yr), etc. When you start talking about coming up with a nickname for nursing that your young child can use in public that won't offend other people, I start wishing I had found another resource. (The author suggests the term ""Numnums"" - gross!) So, if you are a working mother who is looking for a modern-day, practical resource, I would keep looking."
5,Must have for nursing moms!,"I wish I would have read this before I had my baby, it would have saved me a lot of pain and heartache. This would make an excellent shower gift. I recommend that anyone planning on nursing read this book first, it is worth every penny."
5,Knowledge is power!,"Thinking about breastfeeding, or determined to breastfeed? Buy this book to learn the benefits and ins and outs of this natural feeding method! Great knowledge and an easy read!"
2,A bad example,"I am an avid John Constantine fan, and own every collected edition released thus far...but I wish I hadn't bought this one. The 3 stories in the collection that came from the original series were excellent, especially the one by Neil Gaiman (from Hellblazer #27), but the movie adaptation lacked everything that draws people to the pages of John Constantine: Hellblazer. It was bland and lackluster, deficient in both visuals and script. There was none of the old eloquence and sinister power in the dialogue, the characters were boring and unexpressive, and the plot read like a courtroom brief. Strictly speaking, in spite of all the ridiculous changes they made to the characters and story, the movie was better than this sad little representation could convey. I gave this book 2 stars purely out of consideration for the 3 stories taken from the comic series...stories which I reread from time to time in the other collections, and which stand out as classic Constantine."
3,This dosen't give the movie justice,"It was a good story and the extra collected stories were good but as for the adaptation, I felt that a lot was left out and it moved really fast. The story is good but the adaptation could of had a little more effort."
1,Disappointing,"While the old favorites are included, there are so many songs that "" never made it"" and medleys of songs already on the disks. This thing is a bust! Don't buy it"
2,only historical value,"Technical level of this recording is too poor to enjoy Verdi's beautiful music. I'm a great Callas lover, but thanks a lot of disturbing elements in sound of this record it is not possible to find out how Callas took hold of Abigail, a part just written for her. Unfortunately she didn't sing this part more, so this record is good for Callas collectors only."
5,Delectable and sensual erotica,"As what the other reviewers have said, this book is hot! The sex scenes were unforgettable and abundant. The author really has a way with words when describing each scene. You really feel like you are there and experiencing what each person is feeling. And what do you know? The story is actually good! Rosamund's exploits from beginning to end are really captivating. Her encounters with Geoffrey and Ralph are contrasted so well: tender and sweet to rough and hot! If you can get your hands on a hard-to-find copy, you will surely treasure it and read it over and over again."
3,This book proves that-even in erotica- there really is such a thing as too much sex,"This book was well written and the period details were spot on. The first three chapters of this book really grabbed me. The tension,sense of antipation and even titilation that drew the reader in during the opening chapters, however, were ruined by avalanche of sex scenes that began in chapter four and continued incessantly through the conclusion of the book. It seems like every possible sexualy scenario was explored during this book. No stone or trick was left unturned. There were some memorable scenes(like between Rosamund and Margery early in the book) that were affecting and memorable, but once Sir Ralph got his way, there was just one sex scene after another. I know that this was characterized as erotica, but come one. It was unrelenting and the erotic appeal of this book was the lesser for it."
5,Superb!,"The final closure to the exciting series written by Weiss and Hickman. Set in a world where Gods want supreme rule and man mixes with immortals, this series revolves around three humans and their immortals. Excellent book! A must read for loyal fans of Weiss and Hickman"
3,by the third sequel they seem a little tired,"A fantasy sword and magic tales go this is just not the best?All the Arab tribe type story gets old fast with a gods many war in heaven side story of 21 gods in a pantheon where Quar is out to break all the other gods and fails due to the god of the nomads.The last battle that has been building fizzles out at the end;that result more than anything made the novel less worthy?They just seem tired at the end, even though the idea of training falcons to hunt larger animals seems inspired."
2,That was not an ending,"This book was written over 15 years ago so I'm assuming no sequel is forthcoming. As such, the ending is totally unacceptable. You read 1200 pages to get a conclusion and the whole thing ends in 2 pages. I don't mind books that are supposed to be ambiguous or mysterious at the end, but this was neither. The authors apparently decided another chapter would have been too much work. There is no payoff for the time spent reading this. Skip the series."
3,The worst of the series,"The series starts great, and over time compells the reader to read more. This book however, is an unjust ending to it. The reason I gave it only 4 stars was the poor ending. Both armies are lined up against each other for the epic clash, and then suddenly the writer seemingly run out of paper. The armies apparently break up for no apparent reason, the two main heroes curl up in the bushes, and all brings a swift, odd and thoroughly disapointing ending."
4,LEDISI TORE 'DEVOTION' UP IN CONCERT!!!,I just saw Ledisi at BB Kings last night in NYC and she tore a new hole in this song ...I came home and looked up the song only to find out that this CD exists!!!! Just look at the line up!!! I'm buying this CD and you should too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,truly sad,"I can't believe that Maurice White green lighted this project because this Project is so watered down and beneath what the true Elements of the 70's Brought to your Ear. none of the covers here are that interesting aside from La Lah Hathaway. most of the material here just is kinda there. I'm not a particular fan of Tribute Albums and especially when it comes to a Band like the Elements Earth,Wind and Fire. to me I'd rather have the Original Elements back than a Album like this."
2,EWF Needs No Interpretation,"I have major props for EWF, for Maurice, and particularly for reviving Stax Records...but the rearrangements of these classic songs leaves much to be desired. While the artists are certainly talented (how many people in the world can sing like Chaka Khan...), and the music arrangements feel contemporary, I did not get much out of the album. I think a good covers album should take the songs to a new level, such as for the tribute album for Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra (granted that album wasn't brilliant either, but those songs felt more original in general). This album's arrangements generally show why pop and R&B today are terrible--songs are digitized and edited beyond belief, musicians are less inventive and original, and the songs lack the soul that made this music so great in the 70s. If you like EWF, go buy one of their original albums or see them on tour...this album didn't do justice to Maurice and Co."
5,Love this,Real soulful music. Miss hearing the live bands and heart felt songs. Wish more songs were added to this CD.
3,Well interpreted,"I bought this CD just for Lalah Hathaway's 'Love's Holiday', which is at least a minute too short. I also enjoy 'Devotion' and 'September.' Most Earth Wind & Fire fans should appreciate this joint effort."
1,Third-rate fake grunge,"After listening to Sixteen Stone over and over, I bought this, Bush's follow-up CD. I was hoping the band would develop a little. The guitarist is surprisingly good and the singer writes good Nirvana rip-off tunes. But this album was a big disappointment. The first song is thick and heavy, and the second (Greedy Fly) has a nice stop/start section to it. The rest of the album is very boring. The band plays one dull rock riff after another, completely out of ideas. After this CD, I can hardly imagine buying another Bush album. Ever."
5,Listen to the Guitars!!!,"You may of only heard ""Comedown"" ""Glyrcerine"" and ""Swallowed"" the overplayed songs on the radio. But if people actually took the time to really listen to Bush's albums, they would actually discover that this band is much more than three songs.The guitars in the this band, will just blow your head off.They have so much full throttle it justs blows you away (especially the stop start part in ""greedy Fly"")This album is not a sing along album, or a sing a long band.And if your you've heard ""Sixteen Stone"" and are expecting something similiar. Then don't.Its completley different from it and is a very raw and uncut album with songs that are'nt over worked. Which is excellent because it gives the album character and a unique sound.If you like music that involves guitars, then you'll love this band and this album."
1,This album really stinks except for one song!,To tell you the truth this album is a disaster as a follow-up to sixteen stone. Their is only one decent song on it and it could of been alot better. If I were you I would buy the single for swallowed because you are wasting your time with this one.
2,"good band, bad cd","Although I love Bush, I recommend not to buy this Cd. It doesn't really have any good songs on it. No songs get you into the music and make you want to hear them again. When ""Razorblade Suitcase"" first came out, everybody I knew was excited. Bush was a loved band, with a lot of good hits. This Cd doesn't compare to ""Sixteen Stone"" or their newer cd, ""The Science of Things"", whuch both have great songs that keep you listening. I would recomend you check into a different Cd by Bush."
1,Not the best Bush could have done...,"First, I want to mention that this is a neutral review. Razorblade Suitcase is a huge dissapointment when compared to Sixteen Stone. I bought this CD and ended up trading it in for two dollars. I didn't like most of it...it didn't have the same tones, or anything near it, to earlier Bush recordings. More on an industrial side, Bush trailed from their sound on Sixteen Stone and produced an entire new one. If you likes Sixteen Stone, I suggest you listen to this album before purchasing it, because you will probably end up wanting to take it back. =("
4,Great cd,This is a great cd that reminds me of back in the day when you can just sit around and listen without a care in the world
