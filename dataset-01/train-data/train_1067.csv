5,"Tasty, but not just on onion rings!","I remember years ago, my grandmother made onion rings using this mix and they were fantastic! I ended up picking some up at the store and made some onion rings for myself and was very pleased with the outcome. The recipe is very easy and it doesn't take long at all to produce delicious food!Something I've been making lately is fried chicken using this mix. Simply add 1 cup of the mix with 1/2 cup of water, coat the chicken in the batter and fry in oil. I have to tell you that I'm normally pretty hard to please, especially when it comes to home cooked food, but making chicken strips with this batter is one of my favorite snacks I've ever tasted.I plan on trying to make fish and possibly even other foods with this as well, but I can't recommend this highly enough. It might take you a couple attempts to get the perfect end results, but they are well worth it.Hopefully you try this product as well and are as pleased with it as I am! :)"
3,a mess,"Steel Beach appears to have been written by the novel's central computer - schizoprhenic, derivative, dumbed down to please the Dull Normal audience, and an unholy mix of styles from William Gibson to Harry Harrison to, well, John Varley. The last 100 pages are particularly dreadful. A tough editor could have made a pretty good book out of this, but as it is, it reads like it was ghost written by the West Texas John Varley Fan Club and Suvivalist cult.It's a shame, since some of his short stories are really good. There must be some law of 'classic' sci-fi that says short is better.Bottom line: Bad jambalaya."
2,Disappointing,"Interesting but ultimately disappointing science-fiction book. A colony on the Moon, an all-powerful central computer gone mad, medical advances that can handle a decapitation, routine sex changes - all very diverting, but ultimately one gets the impression that every time the plot sags a little, the author simply introduces a new plot element, unconnected to the story so far, to keep it going."
1,I wish the voting system had no stars,"I could never finish it. Maybe it became more varied and interesting later in the story, but the story line was dull and the characters were with out any true development. The author did show the boredom of life created by the too regulated society."
2,Book drags on for ever!,"I did **eventually** manage to persuade myself to finish this book, mainly because I had enjoyed Varley's ""Titan"" so much. But this is nothing like as good.It has some interesting ideas, such as the recreational sex-change idea, the country communities and some of the central computer stuff, but it seems to go on for ages with nothing much happening.Give it a miss!"
3,"""Steel Beach"" is Varley at his usual","For a diehard Varely fan (since Analog's condensed version of ""Titan"" appeared) it was good to see Varley back in the literary game again, after a long absence. His book draws mostly from Opiuchi Hotline and Blue Champagne material, with some disappointing cyberpunk leitmotifs. Good action, interesting characters, sloppy plot (that's the cyberpunk influence again). Overall, a fun read for those of us who have long appreciated Varley's storytelling talents."
2,Varley By The Numbers,"This novel reads as if it was written to fulfill a contractual obligation. Sloppy, passionless, and ultimately pointless.Hopefully, the new novel to be published this fall will represent a return to form for this once passionate visionary."
4,"Excellent Book, but Too Much Sex","I love this book (I've read it three times now), but I still find that there's too much sex in it. I understand why he's got it there (a bored society), but I just don't want a sci-fi book with a sexual theme. If you pull out that, then this book is a classic. It's written in a very Heinleinish way (of course the more recent Heinlein books all revolved around sex, too). It takes a lot from Heinlein's ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress."" Wonderful book, fun to read, but don't give it to the kids."
2,Heinlein Rip off,I read this book after reading the great Gaea series and was expecting at least an original piece of work. Steel Beach rehashes concepts covered by many other authors. Many reviews compare this work to Heinlein and it seems to me as if Varley was channeling RAH when he wrote this novel. It also reads more like a treatment for some sort of future reality show than a novel. It starts out on a fairly high note and half way through becomes bogged down in a morass (literally and figuratively) of sex addicted stoner speak. Even with the poor review I still think Varley is a gifted author and soon will be reading The Golden Globe.
1,My first and last Varley book!,There are very few books I have not or in the case could not finish reading. Obviously Varley appeals to some but I am not one of them. If you are looking for a fast paced Sci-fi adventure this is not the book for you. If you are interested in one man's distorted sexual view of everyday life in the future you might find this entertaining.
3,"Rewarding (Varley always is), but overlong","Varley is always worth reading, but STEEL BEACH is somewhat draggy and overlong. Probably this results from the fact that its protagonist is not particularly likable--at some point I lost interest in the book's primary focus, which is what is going on in his/her psyche. Varley's universe is a compelling one, with many interesting concepts. Unfortunately, many of those in this book have been introduced elsewhere in short stories. I think STEEL BEACH might have made a good novella."
1,Cover your ears,"The voice on this CD is so annoying that I couldn't fully absorb the words. It seemed as if the speaker rushed thru this project. . . Great words, Terrible voice."
5,"""Oh Be Wise"", This helps!",Great book. His writings are inspiring. You will also note some interesting biographical info in the beginning.
5,Well worth the money. Read this and grow.,"Very good and sound wisdom. I disagree when he addresses some of the spiritual areas, but as a whole a very sound book."
5,Simple and amazing,"I read this over a year ago and am doing my second annual reading now. This is one of the few books in my library that is actually worth reading a second time, and a third, and a fourth, well you get the idea. Deep thoughts to get you thinking about life, enjoy!"
4,Non-Fiction,"In the culmination of the truly amazing story of the Adamsons and the lioness, Elsa, the Adamsons are quite surprised to see Elsa again when she brings her cubs back to show them. Sadly, the lioness dies and the Adamsons are left with three motherless cubs that they again must teach somehow to fend for themselves in a wild environment."
4,Good Overall,Cry was a Decent song not the Greatest not the worst.StreetWalker is a Throwaway track to Me.The Video is Alright.You Rock My World Hit&Miss Overall.but Shout is the Cut.the lyrics are strong&Make this Set worth peeping out alone.it's a Shame that MJ isn't getting any Push from Sony.
1,Purchase with caution (if at all),"I purchased this cable in hopes to connect a Mac mini to a Visio 50"" plasma TV. Although this connection seemed like the most logical as far as a pure digital to digital connection, I had a drastically better picture with just a VGA cable and DVI to VGA converter. The TV's VGA input gave me much better resolution options and had a much better picture. When I tried to return the product, the seller basically told me I was stuck with it because I had opened it. I recommend if you are insistent on getting this type of connector, try a store with a flexible return policy first. Even after threatening a poor review, they did nothing to help me other than recommend I sell it on ebay... boo."
3,Inexpensive. Effective for our family.,"This item is great to have around the house with small children.Pros:1. Inexpensive2. EffectiveCons:1. Ugly2. Could be more stableOverall: Great valuePersonal Experience: You may find it useful to place the door stop horizontally, on the top of the door close to the door hinges, as opposed to the way it is pictured in the photographs. This seems to keep at least our door open enough that small fingers are not able to be caught between the door itself and the door frame on the HINGED side. This position also seems to prevent the cushion from being dislodged by a toddler repeatedly slamming the door."
1,short life,"Door Mouse Finger Guard by KidkusionWe put it on a swinging door that springs shut in order to keep the door from slamming shut on fingers. It broke after only a week. It worked well while it lasted, but this just simply didn't last long enough. It isn't a really tight spring, either."
4,It does the job!,"This is great for keeping your little one from slamming a door shut and possibly shutting himself in somewhere or pinching his fingers in the door jamb. It's best for doors that are meant to stay open though, and might slip off doors that are thinner.It's great for the price and does the job!"
3,Better start with book 3,"The three books series is a must for anyone wanting to play Go at a resonable level. Though, I would suggest reading tome n. 3 as your first book as it covers Josekis starting from the 4-4 star point that are the most played ones (and, anyway, enforceable in three corners out of four)."
3,An interesting topic clogged by Phd.-thesis prose.,"As a professional dressmaker myself, I was excited when I found this book. I'm very interested in the history of American women in general and dressmakers in particular. Gamber has done a great deal of research and presents a thoughtful portrait of these early entrepreneurs and how they succeeded and failed.Unfortunately, this book is obviously a Phd. thesis--I say ""obviously"" because the text is dry and heavy with unnecessary five-dollar words. An idea is never presented simply if it can be presented in a complex and wordy manner. A good editor could have cut the length by 25%. Also, there are very few illustrations, which I found disappointing. Nevertheless, it's the best source available on this very specialized topic, so I persevered."
5,A GOOD BRITNEY BOOK,SHE'S GOT IT ALL IS A GREAT BOOK FOR A FAN OF BRITNEY . IT HAS COOL PHOTOS AND TONS OF GREAT INFO OF HER
3,Cheesy but OK,"This book praised Britney a little bit toooo much in my opinion. It was interesting with tons of facts and stuff, but because it was unofficial it didn't have any new info. The author, Alix Strauss writes tons of books like this so its not much different then the others. Ms.Strauss uses teen slang to play up Britneys bio and ends up with a so-so book about the ""beautiful perfect britney!"" If you are a die hard fan then try this one but otherwise don't bother!"
4,Raving good!,"This book is raving good! It gives the MOSt useful bits and pieces, such as about Britney's childhood. It also has pages of colourful photos! This book is not that recent, thoug, that's why I gave it only 4 stars."
4,Best Book Ever,"Well actualy it's not one of her best books,But i found it quite interesting.It has 8 pages of cool photos!I bought the book the other day at the shops,it was expensive for just some recycled paper.But if your a fan of Britney you should get it!"
3,this thing sucks but good in a way baaaaaaaaaaaaa baaaaa,"pros- very accurate, nice range for a electric pistol, full auto, decent velocity for an electric pistolcons- once you press the trigger it shoots 2 seconds laterim still waiting for my friends to shoot a day later still waiting"
5,Essential early Webb Pierce,"While there are now only limited supplies of this deleted CD, it is a must have for fans of Webb Pierce. While the 2-CD set ""The Complete 4 Star And Pacemaker Recordings"" covers most of the material here, this set also includes some fine instrumentals featuring Cliff ""Tex"" Grimsley, Hal Harris, Shot Jackson and Buddy Attaway. A great find!"
1,radiator,"The cooling lines are switched. I wanted to use it for 1984 K20 suburban 6.2L, Diesel, my tranny cooling are on the drivers side, left, engine oil cooler on the right(larger Lines). This radiator turnout to be the opposite. I did not want to cut the end fitting or mess with modifying mine, so I returned it. Also mine was 4 row, so I will order 4 row with lines in the correct place."
1,Ewwww...,"They had to make another brat.....What kind of name is ""Nevra"" anyway? This gal looks suspiciously like another brat, Yasmin. Why do they look so much alike...? Because MGA wants more cash!They simply took Yasmin, removed the beauty mark, and changed her name, and just put different stuff in the set. BAM! Another ugly brat. Sorry, MGA. You're dolls are disgusting, ugly, and they're heads are far too big. I hate those gross girls."
3,Don't go crazy!,"Ok first of all bratz are cool, but don't go all out buying all this bratz, I mean I am 12 years old and I got bored of bratz, so now I have like 14 dolls just sitting there, a nd I regret spending all that money.So if you are a grown up looking to buy a gift for a girl, a LITTLE GIRL this is a good choice, but if you are looking to buy this doll for yourself and you are over 20 years old that is just creepy.Unless you JUST collect them, but if you play with t them that is so creepy,friuty, and especially cheesy."
1,whats with the eye color,"Her eyes are supposed to be blue,why did they make them brown for the safari outfit,I am trying to buy for a kid who wants nevra and likes her blue eyes but doesn't want funk out nevra cause the clothes are the same ones from other bratz dolls,so now i find this safari one but the eyes are brown and not blue.Are the people that make these dolls so stupid that they can't even remember what color the eyes are supposed to be for each doll? My god someone over there is getting lazy if they can't even keep each girls physical features in order."
1,??,I dont't like coulored bratz. I think that her hair is verry hard. You almost can't come it. Her eyes are ugly. They are black. And she is black too. I dont't like dark dolls. She is even blacker than sascha. If you buy this doll you most bee insagne. Alle the bratz are ugly [...] her. IEUWWWWWWW! I like myscene doll and they are much better.
5,???,it's not about the eyes of the dill but about her look and i think nevra looks okey and blue eyes are not verry pretty because she haves brown her and a tinty brown skin colour and brown eyes are pretty
5,she is wonderfull!!!!!!!!! wowwwwwwwww,i love this bratz nevra i love her she is sow pretty first i have fianna wild live safarie but she was broked i wase sow sad now i gonne bye nevra .and fianna later but i don't wanne bye fianna funk out she is there sow different and not pretty sow maby i just bye fianna again wild life safarie but i don't know ..

5,A Treasure,I was very disappointed to see that this collection is out of print. I have read the trilogy several times and always found something new to admire. Ms. Manning is very adept at illuminating the communications and mis-communications of marriage and politics. These novels balance emotional life and political effect very well and they work on many levels. I hope it is back in print soon so I can continue to press it on friends without relinquishing my worn copy.
4,Interesting human and political story,It is a very interesting story from Romania just before the second worldwar. it gives us a view on what happened in eastern europa during a time that we who live in western Europa do not know much about. Kristi 73 years old from Norway
5,"Great, Fascinating writing","Olivia Manning has written a monumental work, for the first time really expressing what life was like for Romanians--and giving a sense of real history. While quite long, it is worth every word. I highly recomend it."
1,Can't believe Cramsession is charging for this!!!,"For years I have downloaded free CramSession study guides for preliminary certification study focus. They where and still are good for general preparation. However, you should put your money towards something a little more detailed and focused like the A+ Passport or A+ Adaptive Exams.... I can't believe they are charging for something that has been free for years!"
5,David Snively - Fantastic as usual,"David Snively has been one of my favorite instructors for many years. He's THE STAR of the many years running awesome show ""The Caribbean Workout"" filmed in sunny Barbados.I'm very glad he has finally come out with a DVD. I love being able to build my own workouts and the variety. Keeps your body guessing and keeps me interested! Keep up the great work David!"
3,One Great Song,"I bought this CD because this is the only compilation of George Duke's songs with ""Born to Love You""."
3,Nothing special,"This is a fairly average piano/vocal/guitar sheet music book featuring a lot of popular songs from 2001. It's not as good as the previous Smash Pop Hits 1999-2000, in my opinion.Most of the songs should be fairly easy to play for the intermediate player although some of the bass lines can be a bit tricky. ""Can't Fight the Moonlight"", ""Shape of My Heart"" and ""Give Me Just One Night (Una Noche)"" are three of my favorites from this book. There are several hip-hop and dance tracks which don't really translate well to piano, which are a bit of a waste of space."
5,Ferret loves it,My ferret loves this thing! First thing he does when I let him out is run back and forth thru the tunnel. Its very comical to watch. I agree with other reviews that if you have a ferret this is a must have toy! They will love it!
4,Ferrets love this!,"The wire has poked through at one end of the tube, easily fixable with duct tape, but still annoying.My ferrets love this toy! It's their favorite toy, tied with their dig box (a large clear bin filled with rice). They chase each other through it, one of them drags an end of the tube around to reposition it, and they love to explore it after I've repositioned it. It's fun to tie in knots, or loop around the legs of a table. Definitely a must have for a home with ferrets!"
5,Unlimited Ferret Fun Potential,"Bought two of these and as you would expect ferrets really enjoy crawling around in long tube like structures. When you open it you may notice a slight plastic smell that dissipates after a few hours. These are very flexible long tubes that can be twisted and maneuvered into whatever shape you or your ferret desires. If you are going to buy anything to entertain a ferret, these should definitely be on the top of your list."
4,Ferret loves this,"My little girl loves this tunnel. When I took her on a play date to visit 4 other ferret friends, it was hilarious to watch! (She defended herself against 4 others rather well, lol, with a slap move (waving both paws in front in a digging/slapping motion!)). I only gave it 4 stars because it is a little pricey for just some plastic, but its worth it."
2,Worked great for the first 2 days then.......,My ferrets completely ripped it apart. The material is very cheap. It could not hold up to the chewing. I would not recommend this to ferrets who like to chew.
3,"Good tube, but very easy to be broken","My ferrets love this toy. However, they keep biting it and finally they broke a hole in the middle of it. The idea of making it is good: transparency for a clear view, and high extensibility. The only problem is, the material is too cheap to survive ferrets' bite."
4,excelent toy,"This one is my ferret's favorite, I have two of them and they like to enter each one by each side and see who get's out the other. very funny."
2,My ferret hardly fits???,"Not sure if my ferret is fat, but he hardly fits in this tunnel especially if going up... Oh well it's something to keep her busy..."
4,"Great, but....","These are great, but, dryer vent hoses work just as well. Just make sure no wires are poking out. You can get 25 foot hoses for $15, or 8 foot hoses for $5."
4,My kids love it,My kids have been playing with their ferrets in this tunnel and they have been having a ton of fun. My only wish is that it were a bit longer.
2,Format refreshing & some good tips but info conflicts,"Integrity, caring & exceptional service but just ""let them go"" if they take more than 3 home showings? Better have LOTS of leads. No cold calling but hand deliver or mail 50-100 open house invites + call each one before the event? Good tip but isn't that door knocking and cold calling?"
1,Don't bother...,"This book is a complete waste of time and money. The one and only concrete piece of advice it has to give (to use open houses as the best sources of leads and new business) could have been condensed in a page and a half. Everything else amounts to little more than a cheesy pep talk. The book is poorly edited and the format (a conversation between two hypothetical people sitting next to each other during a plane flight) is highly irritating and an insult to the reader's intelligence.Had I had the opportunity to peruse this book in a bookstore, I never would have bought it. I was looking for a down to earth book filled with practical ideas for attracting new business, not a ""motivational"" talk.Obviously, the authors have found that writing a quick and dirty ""how-to"" was a better way to get rich quick than selling homes."
4,Shake up your next meeting,"Are you looking for something a little different for your next customer service meeting? Then try reading CUSTOMER AT THE CROSSROADS: FROM PARABLE TO PRACTICE by Barbara Hateley and Eric Harvey. Or better yet, read it a few times to learn the story details and then simply tell the story. Either way, your meeting will be interesting and a great variation from the norm.I recently used this book in a meeting of retail store managers. Each manager was assigned a character in the book and additional managers were the chorus. It was great fun and afterwards I received high praise for presenting them with a fun and unique learning tool.At only 48 pages, this little parable can easily be read in less than an hour, but the lessons learned could last a lifetime. Short & sweet. A good training tool."
4,Engaging book -- but not for everyone,"This book won't appeal to people who like stories that have beginnings, middles and ends, more or less in that order. At first the author's narrative techniques are hard to get used to, but it's worth it in the end because he always seems to tie up the details of seemingly unrelated threads in the story. Some of the stories are more like prose poems, using sections with the titles of Web browser screen commands, different kinds of legal actions, recipes for cooking Spanish potatoes or titles of terrible 1970s songs like ""Billy don't Be A Hero"" & ""The Night Chicago Died."" The book is oddly effective when it goes into memories of the characters and their experiences. The best story is ""Mysteries of Ranch Management,"" which isn't as good as Annie Proulx's tales of gay Wyoming cowboys but which has more humor and a lot of facts about something called leafy splurge."
5,Not Your Uncle's Gay Short Stories,"The author's weird sense of humor and roundabout way of tellinga story, with lots of asides and non sequiturs, reminded me of DaveEggers or David Forster Wallace. The characters here have no boring coming-out problems (except maybe the cowboy in Wyoming, but who can blame him) or typical gay situations. You get the feeling they care more about witty conversation than sex, but the humor doesn't seem very gay. It's kind of a bizarre take on gay relationships, often online ones, and the book drags in spots. But then you get these incredible riffs that really sparkle, particularly in the title story. ""The Silicon Valley Diet"" knocked me out when I first read it ... and it holds up great on the second reading."
5,Compelling and funny,"This was a compelling and funny book. I like the way the author has a sense of humor about his (or his characters) relationships. There's a lot of rambling, so if you like plot as the main thing in a short story, this probably wouldn't be to your taste. But the dialogue is brilliant and sometimes hysterically funny. I give it five stars."
1,Pointless,This is a pointless game. The Object is to move a bubble to the end of each level without popping it. it's okay for little kids.
1,Re-edited Chinese TV series,"As well as being terribly dubbed, this is also simply a recent Chinese TV series that has been re-edited into a movie. Avoid!"
4,"47 a magical number, indeed.","The first listen through this CD, I started to become dissapointed in my purchase after the first couple songs.But then, something happened; I heard Kangaroo Pocket Calculator.There it dawned upon me, as Minekawa led her stunning musical debate on just why the number 47 was so wonderful, that this woman was udderly genius.You see, when I was visiting Japan several months ago, I was somewhat forced to go to various temples in Kyoto which were each very geared to tourists. However, there was a woman there. She was wearing a pink sweater, and she was taking pictures of moss. She didnt care about any silly temples, she had just come to this place to take pictures of moss.Takako is that woman, and therefore I love her."
5,Wonderful book!,This is a very good book about several different women who contributed in various ways to the China Inland Mission. Well written. Shows that God will use anyone who is willing to yield to Him.
1,Will not play DRM files,I bought this MP3 player to play audio books from the library I can downlowd from their site. The files download just fine but when I go to play them it just skips around randomly making it impossible to listen to the story. I tried to return it and unfortunately this is not covered under their warranty and my 30 days are up for amazon.
1,For Blindly Faithful Lovers Only,"Frances Mayes adds ""In Tuscany"" as the third in her seemingly never-ending series about life in Bella Toscana-- following her hugely successful ""Under A Tuscan Sun,"" its sequel ""Bella Tuscany,"" and several calendars. Unfortunately this latest effort left this reader greatly disappointed, as the author fashions verbal portraits of standard aspects of Italian life (e.g. the cucina-- kitchen; piazza, etc.). This time around, she adds complementary photos-- but many are soft focus, artsy blurred images, rather than the stunning, breathtaking images found in many other books, such as ""Most Beautiful Villages in Tuscany."" Take a peek before you lay your money down. This book leaves much to be desired-- at least for me."
4,Beautiful photographs,"This book is quite different from Mayes' first two books about Tuscany, which were more like travel memoirs. This book's focus is photographs, accompanied by some commentary, thoughts, and insights from Mayes, as well as some recipes. Frankly, I didn't read the text at all. I just enjoyed the photographs. I wish I'd had this book when I was reading Under the Tuscan Sun and Bella Tuscany because all the places she talks about in those books are scattered throughout the pages of this book in beautiful photographs. We finally get to see what Mayes' charming Bramasole house looks like, as well as the town of Cortona and the surrounding Tuscan countryside. If you haven't read Mayes' first two books, read them and have this one handy so you can see for yourself just how beautiful these houses, towns, and people are."
4,Very pleased,"This book came in perfect condition and I've enjoyed reading about the customs, recipes & lifestyles of the land and people that are the basis of one of my favorite movies, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"". Very happy with my purchase!"
5,A Book to Savor,"This latest book from Frances Mayes is a book to savor just as one would savor a fine bottle of wine or a cool Autumn evening in front of a crackling fire with nothing in front of you but hours of time to read ...lovely! Ms. Mayes has the soul and the eyes of a poet to produce such a book. More, more."
1,The Complete Idio's Guide to Beautiful Skin,"Don't waste you time. This is a waste of energy, paper and money. If you are interested, I'll GIVE you mine. If you'll take it, that is."
3,Much ado about nothing...,"I bought this book with the hope that it would actually give examples of products to buy and what to look for. Instead it only gives advice about what ingredients to look for or stay away from. Although it does include helpful tips on allergens and skin conditions, I was pretty disappointed. I already knew so much of what was said, and the book focuses on problems so briefly and spends a chunk of time discussing everything from peels to plastic surgery! It basically says a little about a lot rather than a lot about the basics. If you are completely uninformed...GO FOR IT! Otherwise save your money."
2,"Compelling tale, but poorly written","What could have been a compelling story is unfortunately marred by very poor writing and editing. The book provides a glimpse into someone living with food phobias and eventually an eating disorder, with indications of some of the potential causes. As in so many stories about eating disorders, though, there is more emphasis upon the symptoms and development of the disorder than there is upon the recovery process. The author goes off to a well-known research treatment facility, then the book comes to an end with her emergence from there and a fast-forward into months later, when she has apparently recovered fully from the problems which had haunted her. It would have been far more useful to readers to have had some insights shared by the author as to how this came about, how she was able to maintain her weight and move forward into recovery."
5,this is in my top ten all time favourite records,"this album is great for anyone that likes chill music with female vocals. this is definitely one of the sexiest albums ever recorded, up there whith lovage's ""music to make love to your old lady by"". fans of portishead, mogwai, papa m, will oldham, ISIS, gy!be, sigur ros (or any melancholy music,really) will eat this up. great brook valley is my favourite track, with the neil young cover, danger bird, coming in second."
2,Unenjoyable,"The first two songs put you to sleep, not in a good Nyquil kind of way. It just meanders with no real destination. The third song picks up a bit, but nothing special. I'll keep listening until I delete all of it from my ipod."
4,rock the boat,"The import single for rock the boat contains the album version rock the boat, we need a resoultion and the rock the boat club mix. Mixed by Mixzo (also has done mixes for artists such as Maxwell) the rock the boat club mix is sure to be a club hit. Although the mix is a total of only five minutes and sixteen seconds it is a must have for those who love club music and a must for all Aaliyah fans. (Also check out the More than a woman single it contains the full length version of the More than a woman video.)"
1,Outdated romance....,"After reading all of the glowing reviews here, this book was quite a dissapointment to me. The book was written almost 20 years ago and I think that it shows its age. The heroine is beautiful, but appears to have no other positive qualities. She's not obviously intelligent, witty, insightful, or compassionate. It takes her over 400 pages to *almost* figure out the obvious. In addition, the heroine is constantly being saved by the hero. I prefer a woman who can take care of herself. The romance in this book is based on the heroine betraying her husband, and there are several instances of the outdated idea that when a woman says ""No"" she really means ""Yes."" I find none of these plot devices particularly romantic.Read something, anything, by Julie Garwood instead."
2,"too long,,boring,,","this book could have been written in tow thirds of its length.i skimmed through most if it. and i didn't like the ending,how he was not what he seemed.too nicely wrapped."
1,Predictable,"I usually enjoy Woodiwiss's work and to be honest, I have no idea what everyone is seeing in this one! I had the ""secret"" of the story figured out about 50 pages into the book and found the so called heroine to be shallow and petty. The story was OK, but outdated and not all that exciting. How many times must this girl get herself into trouble and then have her dashing hero come to her rescue?!? She is not a strong woman in the least - instead, she comes of as silly, stupid and weak waiting for a man to come get her out of all the messes she gets into. I was disappointed in this book and was glad that I had gotten it from the library instead of actually paying for it!"
4,loved it,"Other then the very obvious 'mystery.' I absoutely loved this book as much as ""Shanna."" It was a little wordy, in places; not as much as ""The Wolf & the Dove"" I promise."
5,great book,I have read this book several times and each time it gets better. Kathleen Woodiwiss is a great storyteller and I have read all of her books.
4,storyteller,"The beautiful Erienne Fleming is sold on the auction block to pay her father's debts. She despises The man who bought her because she loves another. Sound familiar? There are a lot of smoldering glances and misunderstood words between Erienne and her owner Lord Saxon, the dark mishappen man. A black coach is deeply feared by all. One that carries a devil or a Robinhood. As usual everything works out alright and Erienne already has her man. Good book, sometimes overdone and overblown in the fact that Erienne is so beautiful no man can keep his eyes off her and wants to bed her immediately. Does get interesting when the dark and light collide and merge."
3,Starts slow but gets better,"Rose's character was highly annoying in the beginning with her childish tamptrums combined with her blind devotion to her brother and father. Both men have done nothing but neglect and abuse her yet she continues to defend them and the reader is left to think she must not be very intelligent. All men who see her seem to be slobbering with lust for her but her character has nothing else to offer except her beauty.Because of this, I almost gave up on it. However, with her marriage to Lord Saxton, it started to get better and just when I would think I had it figured out, I would begin to doubt myself, so I had to keep reading. I especially like the fact that Rose begins to develop some strength of character and is determined to do the right thing by her husband."
2,Very predictable,I was a little disappointed with this book. Having only read one other KW book (The Wolf and the Dove) years ago I was very excited that this might be of an equal standard... it wasn't. Although it has a nice enough story line it was all too predictable from the beginning. I found myself skipping paragraphs and even pages just to get to the end.
2,Too long,I was a little disappointed with this book. Having only read one other KW book (The Wolf and the Dove) years ago I was very excited that this might be of an equal standard... it wasn't. Although it has a nice enough story line it was all too predictable from the beginning. I found myself skipping paragraphs and even pages just to get to the end.
2,Okay as a break from deep thinking.,"I'm not usually a romance reader, so forgive me if I'm a bit biased. Upon a good friend's recommendation, I read ""A Rose in Winter."" Ahem. Aside from a page of shameless pilfering from the Phantom of the Opera, a Scooby Doo sort of predictability throughout the whole story, a heroin who manages to experience attacks on her virtue at just about every stop on the road (and sometimes in the carriage), lines from the hero that are so cheesy they could put Velveeta out of business, and a villain that is the rich equivalent of Snidely Whiplash (complete with mustache), A Rose in Winter was...okay. The characters were some fun, and the plot at least tried to have twists. If you're into strenuous reading, but don't mind putting rational thought on hold for the hour and a half it takes to read this book, go ahead--but don't expect to be surprised by the way things turn out. If you're into pure escapism--have at it, and enjoy!"
4,almost perfect for me,The one thing that was a little annoying was the fact that the Erinee was so bent on hateing Christopher that she didnt come off as a very likeable character for me.I am all for the main characters hating eachother in the beginning and toward the middle but Ms. Woodwiss dragged it out till the last 50 pages or so.I mean she knew that her father wasn'tthe most honest of men and she wouldn't give Christopher the time of day or let him tell his story.Christopher was very determined in what he wanted and I knew right away what he was trying to do but I loved the story line and ho9w he went about it.
5,absolutely loved it,"this book was the best of Woodiwiss I've read so far. Couln't put it down. The storyline was dynamic, characters well described, dialogs gave just enough hints, the plot exciting. Definitely recommend to every romance addict."
4,Good book still reading,Still reading. I can tell this going to be a book that I will enjoy reading. I really enjoy Kathleen woodiwiss books.
5,Unforgettable Love Story!,"A new take on the Beauty and the Beast story, A Rose in Winter is one of my top 3 romance novels. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. Erienne is a colorful, willful, and proud character that readily jumps out of the pages, making it easy to relate with her. Christopher was a devious and thoroughly devastating character, it was impossible not to fall for him. The story was enticing and romantic, it was magnificently written. I was able to form a mental image of all the characters and the background as if seeing it on television. Being a romantic at heart, I truly love this book! My wish is that other writers would keep to the same formula Ms. Woodiwiss does, romance is in the way you seduce through looks and anticipation before touch. I now believe in romance and true love."
5,Rose in Winter,Kathleen was my favorite ever...she never wrote a bad one..I could not wait for her next book....I truely miss her books
5,favorite romance,I got this particular book when it first came out and have read it at least once a year since. There aren't that many books out there that you can do that with!
3,"Good story, but predictable.","I had never read any of Kathleen Woodiwiss' books. I know that she is one of the premier romance writers so I gave this book a try. I have to say, Kathleen has a way with words! Perhaps too many words. Her prose is way tooooo long and very syrupy. But in all fairness, the story was good. However, if truth be told, I saw the ending coming from the middle of the book. Everyone knows that the hero gets the girl and the crook is always the one you don't suspect. Classic plot. But I haven't given up on her. I'll try another one of her books. At least, I was interested enough in the love affair to finish the book."
5,Wonderful,This CD gets better each time I listen to it. There is a compelling perfection in the sound - it's sublime.
4,Great value,"Even used gently (no hard scrubbing), this is a very effective exfoliant. A little (1/2 tsp) is enough for my entire face. It has no fragrance, and feels a bit like shortening at first, but don't be fooled, it rinses off easily."
4,Quick Connect works well with my motorhome city water intake,My motor home has the city water intake above the tire and almost against the inside fender. I needed a 90 degree adapter and this one works well. It is a tight fit to screw it on but not hard to take on and off at the campground. I love the quick connect feature for the water hose and it doesn't seem to leak once it's tightened on.
1,Don't buy these shirts,"I bought a bunch of these shirts because I saw the good reviews. At first I was happy, they fit perfect, then I washed them once in cold water and they shrunk more than I ever seen shirts shrink in my life. My medium shirts became XXS. I wish I had a 8 year old son, because he would be the only person that would be able to fit in them now."
4,Sleeveless tees Cotton,"If the product was a little longer or came in 3XLT rather than just 3XL. it would be perfect. Cotten is not heavyweight but is very lightweight. That being said, it is the only sleeveless Tee I can find in 100% cotten, so therefore it gets 4 stars."
4,GREAT SHIRTS!,"These jerseys were inexpensive and very much worth the price. They look great and most important of all, the fit is extremely comfortable."
4,Reasonable Product with Small Neck/Arm Holes,"Generally a good product. Like the fact that it's all cotton. It would be nice if the arm and neck holes were a bit larger. I'm not a huge guy by any means, but this feels a bit tight around the neck and shoulders"
4,Review,"I bought 3 XL shirts and they shrunk alot, the shirt itself looks nice and material is good,I recommend ordering at least 2 sizes bigger"
2,"Ordered ""XL"", ACTUALLY ""LG"", shrank to ""MED"". Tummy shows.","These are not heavy shirts, and shrink like Swap Meet Specials. Order TWO sizes bigger. Not a great deal."
2,The cut is not roomy and didn't like the fabric.,"I am a large person and ordered these in a 3X but the actual fit was more like a 2X, so I ended up giving them to a friend of mine. One other thing that I did not like was the material; it was a stretchy cotton that does not breath much at all, it seemed much more like polyester to me; I had to look at the tag to make sure that they were really made of 100% cotton! I recommend going to JCPenny.com and getting their Tees made of cotton jersey material."
1,DON'T BUY THIS - INFERIOR PRODUCT!,"We buy these shirts at Target all the time in a size large for my husband, but Target was out of them so we purchased them at this online store, thinking they'd be the same. They are TOTALLY INFERIOR and are sized incorrectly from the store bought version in same exact brand & size. And they are lighter in thickness (ounce weight), which may be a plus to some people in our hot climate. They are 4 inches narrower in width around the chest & waist than the same one purchased at Target. We test washed one in warm water & low heat in the dryer to see if it would shrink & it did like another customer mentioned, and now it fits like a medium size. We don't want to exchange what we ordered & get ""extra large"", as the armholes will be too large. Very inferior product, they are going back for a refund!"
1,BAD collars,"I bought these because of the Jerzees name. MISTAKE! I bought 6 of these. 1 to try out, 5 to either keep or return. I will be returning the other 5. The issue is the collar. Even though it's ribbed, it basically stretched out of shape so badly after only one wash! It looks like its had 30+ washings! I will shop elsewhere."
2,"Great shirt, not good seller","These shirts are great and never shrink, BUT this seller charges way too much for ONE shirt. I thought I was getting a few for this price and was very disappointed when only ONE shirt arrived. Can get this much cheaper elsewhere."
1,Have Not Recieved Still,"I still have not recieved this item that I ordered. I did get the star spangle shirt and love it but I have yet to have recieved this one and am not sure of who to contact about it. Please let me know how to go about getting it. I was under the impression I would have recieved it a number of weeks ago (it was part of a going away gift of my better half who is deployed to fight the war now) and still have not had word or recieved it.Thank You,Holly Padilla"
1,Mega wrong,"I'm considering buying this as a reminder of how wrong professionals like Ralph can be.Some of the other reviews here are funny. ""I think it takes guts ....to have in print that you predict that this bull market will run through 2011.""""Best known for his correct 1995 prediction that within three years the market would hit 7000""If he'd predicted it would hit 7000 again in 2009 I'd really be impressed."
1,A long bomb or a Hail Mary - - I'm not sure which...,Acampora makes one great call for every 9 misses. This book is simply a few hundred (brochure) pages of shallow predictions based on some narrow -- and often misguided -- parallels of history.
1,Self-serving and promotional--author should stick to charts,This was one big brochure--for Acampora and for Prudential. I can sum up the entire book in a few words: The underpinnings of the current bull market were also seen in previous bull markets. Is this a new revelation? No revelations here.
1,No new lessons here--,"If you want to learn how to accurately --and profitably--use technical analysis, I recommend Tom Dorsey's ""Point and Figure Charting."""
2,"The Fourth Mega-Market, Now Through 2011",Do not waste your time reading Ralph J. Acampora's book. It is another way Mr. Acampora is trying to make money is today's world. When will he have enough?
1,what a piece of junk,"First of all, this rocket is tiny, and it took me a long time to find motors for it. The rocket is so small, it is NOT worth the price. Try the Patriot M-104, twice as big and STILL cheaper than this piece of junk. From my experiences with model rockets , I know that this is DEFANITLY an N.T.B.S.A. rocket: Never To Be Seen Again. Also, this rocket is so flimsy, it bends very easily. So, if you like junky, overpriced rockets, this one's for you."
5,Wow,Really worth it. The songs are fantastic and the singers rip into the stuff. The instrumentals are excellent. If you like Western Swing (and who doesn't?) this is one for the collection.
3,Pick and chose,"Interesting book, but poor anthroplolgy.He picks and choses his cultures and cites what seems to agree with him.He seems to hae never gone to a geiratric center where women sit around knitting, or talking about their children who don't callHe misses the aggression in young women sand girls - the competativeness to attract males, be prettier, etc.He does rescognize the passivity that grows in old men as they lose there 'virilty', but they still look.Old men whose youth did not involve much physical prowness, but intellectual prowness, often fit the role of senior advisor he talks about, even in American socieity.Even this review is an exmple of male aggressivewness in old age."
1,Not a cat collar,I previously purchased 2 cat collars from this vendor. I was so pleased I decided to get another. The one I got is marked dog collar and is not a breakaway design like the other 2.I will not put this on my cat.
3,Cherry Blossom Cat Collar,This cat collar is not as cute up close as it looks in the photo. I think it's well made but the design is just sort of disappointing.
5,Comprehensive and worth the money,"For anyone working in oil and gas or oil and gas litigation this is a great reference. No more Googling every abbreviation or anagram to find out what it means though I confess, not every term I need to define is included, this was the best and most comprehensive dictionary I could find."
3,pretty good movie,this movie was pretty good but it lacked spice and flavor no real big climatic scene but it was good just not a whole lot of action but i would watch it again..
1,"""Uhhh.......whens the good part coming""","SUCKED!!!!! A guy buys an Island that is used to bury John Does, and other unknown people, to put up some place to help the homeless. Then, here comes the scariest part, a bunch of flies scare em away. I thought this was gonna be at least a semi-decent zombie film, but I was SOOOOOOOOOOO wrong. What happens? (counting), 5-6 people die by FLIES. Oooooh scary. This movie pisses me off. DONT BUY IT!!!!!! I waited an hour for something some what interesting to happen and the movies like an Hour and a half long. SUCKED!!!!! if I could have given it -1000000000000000000000001 stars I would. Oh yeah, if anyone wants to buy this from me for 6 bucks contact me through my e-mail."
4,Dead,"I thought this plot to be rather thin and '50ish. The acting was very good, but the storyline was extremely lacking. My favorite part was the excellent music score coupled with the intensity and indivuality of the characters. The whole picture could have been tied together better for a number of reasons. Malcolm McDowell carried his role, once again, to the ""T."" On average, I liked the film and would recommend it to other viewers."
1,Very very clever marketing on a bad movie.,"I like other reviewers got this movie because I thought it was going to have zombies and be your typical ""undead"" horror movie. I was very disappionted an hour into the movie and still no zombies. What you get are killer bees. Very boreing, and very misleading! Please don't buy this movie."
1,Tedious,"This was one lame movie, a tedious mishmash which looked good on the Blockbuster shelf, but which conspired to put me to sleep. The faux artsy flashbacks, the deadly pacing, and the general sense of pointlessness made me hope that perhaps Jesse Franco was involved, but even his movies have more inspiration. Malcolm McDowell looks tired. Sad, sad, sad."
1,"Awful, awful waste of time","The movie is about a hive mind swarm of flies, with some sort of uber-toxin that decomposes your body in minutes. There are no zombies, even though the title of the the movie is ""island of the dead"" and it takes place on an island full of many unidentified bodies. There's not even any witty dialog, which is the only saving grace of some otherwise unbearable horror movies.There is also a flashback of some girls jumping rope, which has absolutely nothing to do with anything in the movie, and it is shown 3 or 4 times. It's there to make the director feel like he's artsy.Please save 90 minutes of your life, and pass on this."
4,A Decent Movie,"Honestly, I like this movie. I agree with the other reviewer who felt that the scenes with the children dancing detracted from the plot. However, if you ignore the kids you get a movie with a creepy atmosphere, some good scares, and morality. Plus, you get killer bugs that may or may not be the incarnation of the souls of the people who have been buried in a Potter's field.What's not to like?"
2,Is Danielle Losing Her Touch????,"I've read every one of Danielle Steel's books and this is the 2nd book in a row that has disappointed me. The subject was interesting enough but she was so repetitious that it was tiring. Her books are what I consider very easy, quick reads that you can get through in a day but I had to skip around much because of the repetitiveness. Example: On one page she'll describe her relationship with her husband and then you go to the next chapter she'll give another recap and then another and another. Maybe not always in the same words but you get the gist of it. If you read it, you'll get what I'm saying. Needless to say, very disappointed!!!"
3,a great book,"It took me about 2-3 weeks to read this book. It involves Maddy and Jack Hunter. They seemed to have a very happy marriage on the outside. However, on the inside, it was a very bad marriage. Jack constantly belittled Maddy and he often made her feel worthless. He called her names.Anyway, I was very entertained during the first week and a half of reading this book. During the last week, however, I got really impatient with Maddy. It took her quite a while to leave Jack!"
2,BIG Disappointment,"I have read every Danielle Steele book she has every written, this one is just your typical woman in trouble story. Ms. Steele's writing of late has become encreasingly predictable. She always has a woman in peril, she finds her way out, falls in a bad situtation again, and finds a man to help her get out of it. This book does do a very good job of addressing the subject of verbal/emotional abuse but the rest of the story is a waste of time. I read Ms. Steele's books for what I call escapism not to have a moral lesson shoved in my face, when I want that I will read my bible."
4,Very Excellent Read,Journey was very well-written and address the issues about abuse very well. Kudos Danielle Steel she hit a home-run was this book
1,Beyond fiction,"DS has churned out another predictable, improbable, formulaic story. Although she did credible job of trying to show the dymanics of abuse, her efforts were overshadowed by the unrealistic context. The entire adoption piece was ridiculous in every respect and was completely at odds with reality. Life is too short for such writing."
1,Waste of Time,"This was one of the worst D.S books I have ever read. It drags, the story is awful and I feel like it was a total waste of time. Where are the days of Zoya, Malice and Message From Nam?"
2,Not What I Was Looking For,"I am a writer of romance novels and find Ms. Steele's popularity a bit confusing. In the past, she seems to basically repeat the same story, rich man, rich woman, only changing the characters' names and the setting. I was hoping this one would be different, since it deals with an abusive relationship. But alas, she still seems to follow the same guidelines as with her others. Much repetition, and I was disappointed with the writing style."
3,You'll hate her husband!,"Not Steel's best works, but a poignant story. What kept me reading with enthusiasm was hating the husband & wanting to see him get what he deserved! I think the story meant well, but it just didn't seem to mesh for me. If you're looking for something good by Steel, I'd recommend Message from Nam, No Greater Love, Safe Harbour or The Long Road Home- They're all about over-coming & surviving."
4,An enjoyable read for Danielle Steel fans,"This wasn't one of my favorite Steel books, and I've read them all. But as a true fan of her work, I still found it worth reading. You either like Danielle Steel's books or you don't, and if you do, go ahead and read Journey, it's worth your time."
2,Even more cookie-cutter than her other books,"I have read many of Danielle Steel's novels, and have actually really enjoyed most of them. You can't expect anything deep, but they are entertaining and relaxing. However, I have found that she is beginning to rest on her laurels a bit. Not only is she sticking with the same basic formula, she's starting to reuse characters. Maddy, the successful network anchor in Washington, D.C. is practically the exact same character as Mel, the successful network anchor from New York, as in Changes, which came out several years ago. That gets boring. Plus the endings get tied up in a pretty bow too quickly now. Stick with her earlier works for the best reads (even the relatively recent Accident and Lightning are better)."
1,The Journey,"I agree with the other person who commented on Danielle's overuse of the word ""and"". Her run-on sentences are very annoying, but I can usually overlook them if I like the story. Of course, this is a very disturbing story, but that was not my main objection. It was the constant use of vulgar language. I truly believe she could have had just as effective a story without the use of language, especially by Maddy. Maybe the awful husband, but Maddy did not need to stoop to his level of speech. It changed her character when she began using his gutter language back to him."
5,A Journey worth taking.,"As usual Danielle has taken a subject that is much on the minds of women today. Abuse, for years abuse was thought of as black and blue marks on the outside but in reality more women suffer from the black and blue marks on the inside. These women can be seen just as our Maddy is,as beautiful, successful, and with a got it together attitude. But all of this is a front, many a night these women are abuse through bad language and put downs that creates a feeling of being useless, ugly,un-loved and a feeling of never doing anything right. This book tells of someone who escapes the a life of black and blue on the outside to be plunged into a life of black and blue on the inside. This is a story of Maddy's escape a second time. I would recomend this book to all women but especially the one's that live a life like Maddy's, a life that makes them wonder if they can take the journey and be happy or are they destined to a life of co-dependency that they will never escape from."
5,journey,"WHEN I FIRST STARTED THIS BOOK, I WASNT SURE WHAT TO EXPECT. I CAN SAY I WAS SO PLEASENTLY SURPRISED. A LOT OF AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, BUT THIS WAS SUCH A DIFFERENT LOOK AT IT. I READ THIS BOOK IN ABOUT 24 HRS. I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN, AS WITH MOST OF MS. STEEL'S BOOKS. I HAVE READ EVERY ONE OF HER BOOKS, AND I CAN SAY THIS ONE WAS INCREDABLE. I LOVED THE STORY, THE CHARACTORS, AND THE EMOTIONS. I CANT WAIT FOR A NEW BOOK TO COME OUT."
2,not her best,"I have read all of Steel's books over the years, and I have been increasingly disappointed with each new attempt. Journey was no exception. Though her portrayal of domestic abuse was well-intentioned, I found the character development weak. The reader gains no insight into Jack's life, including his childhood or background. Maddy's discovery of her long-lost daughter seemed too sudden and coincidental. Amazingly, Lizzie had no negative feelings toward her mother for abandoning her and never attempting to find her. The plot was overly simplistic; such a serious topic as domestic abuse deserves more in-depth exploration without the wealthy, fantasy life overtones found in all of Steel's books. Definitely not one of Steel's best."
1,I WANT THOSE HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK! This book is dangerous!!,"Luckily, I listend to the audio tape version and was spared the ""grammar"" issues. However, I feel sorry for the poor reader who had to wade through this garbage (grammar errors and all). This book is the most insultingly dangerous collection of bovine excrement that I have ever read. Any woman trapped in an abusive relationship SHOULD NOT take the advise of the so called ""expert"" in the book. I was so sick of the main character's inability to come in out of the rain, that I contemplated not finishing the book several times. This is a poorly written, boring and frustrating book. I was highly recommend reading the back of a cereal box before picking up this piece of mindless..."
4,Great for the middle school classroom,"I used this with my 6th grade intermediate reading class. The students absolutely loved reading The Outsiders and this teaching guide made it so easy. It had blackline masters for vocabulary and summary writing pages, it also gave the important vocabulary for each chapter and different activities that could be used at the end of reading each chapter. My favorite part though was the fact that it already had tests created for every few chapters, all I had to do was make copies and hand them out. I would suggest this teacher guide for anyone teaching The Outsiders, especially in a middle school setting."
3,Better Products Out There,Standard material for quick quizzes and vocab review. Some okay activities for middle school on thems in the book.
5,Must Have/Must Give,"THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!!! If you have a friend, loved one, associate or even know a random associate who is at all interested in Rugby, you owe it them and humanity to encourage them to get this game. Heck, buy it for them. For those who have played every other sport title and are looking for a unique sports sim to conquer, prepare for hours of enjoyment and challenge when you pick up Rugby 2005. This game combines realistic plays a variety of bone crushing hits and tackles and sizzling graphics and gameplay to make a complete package. Various game modes and players make this game a hit. Most sports titles get boring and even obsolete after a few weeks but Rugby 2005 will drag you back to your game console time and time again. If you don't believe me try it...better yet get the opinion of the rugby fan you get this title for."
4,I Really Want These to Be the Letters of a Portuguese Nun,"There is some doubt surrounding the authenticity of the heart-rending love notes claimed to have been written by a cloistered nun to a French officer, the lover who abandoned her. Published in the seventeenth century, the four passionate letters filled a tiny, but incomparably-popular book measuring only 5 1/2 inches by 3 inches. The four letters are included in Myriam Cyr's book, but the largest part of the book reveals the well-researched and well-written story about the history supporting, as well as explaining, the circumstances in which the letters were written. The author also illustrates the opposing opinions that the letters are truly those of a Portuguese nun, and that they were actually written by a French aristocrat. The author believes that the letters were indeed those of a jilted, heart-broken nun. I sincerely hope that she's right!"
5,Can't believe it was that easy!,"Cheap, easy to use, and it worked! I thought I'd give this a try since I needed to change the main bearing seal on my WWII jeep. I was scepictal that it would work, but for $6 it was worth a try. I had the upper seal installed in 20 minutes (I'm using the rope type seal)! Make sure you to pre-work the seal like the instructions say, I don't think it would fit otherwise. No more embarrassing oil puddles left behind from me!"
4,easy cooking with children,"I original bought this book for my own children, and now i am back to buy it as a gift. It is very easy for children to follow. The book contains many easy and different recipies. My children love it, it gets them excited about food"
1,Seriously flawed..,This thing is a P.O.S.toy-like (seriously!)constructionfragile.Actually seems like something you would find hanging on the racks of the dollar store.The sound quality is am radio-likethe actual distance you can be away from the receiver is about 12 ft.and even when in range it drops out. I only paid 16 for it on overstock auctionsIm glad I didnt pay retailIf you decide to get a wireless system.. buy one on ebay and expect to pay at lease $50 used
4,Bought for a model 742 woodmaster,"Fits my model 742 BDL woodsmaster like a glove. Remington will tell you this will not fit but it does.You may want a shorter screw on the forearm end but it's not necessary.Again, fits my 742 woodsmaster great!Also a pretty good price."
5,Remington Model 742 Replacement Stock and Forearm,As stated by previous reviewers - This stock and forearm WILL fit the Model 742. Works as advertised and a much more economical solution for stock replacement. Wood items are NO LONGER available from Remington and second source vendors want an arm and a leg for wood replacement stocks and forearms. If you are a hunter then this is the route to take to replace stock and forearm.
5,Great product and a great price,"Before I purchased this, I saw on line in many cases where ads stated that the 7400 model stock set would not fit the 740 models. Well, I did some more research and found that to be false. I have a Remington 740 Woodsmaster in .308 cal. I didn't want another standard stock because mine was in good shape to begin with but the Monte Carlo stock with the raised cheek rest intrigued me.It fit very well and was a 99% match to the original. The only small modification I had to make was to grind down the spacer piece designed to fit just inside the rear of the rifle before bolting it on. You can secure it in a vise with a towel or something so as not to scratch it and use a file to remove maybe 1/8"" of material and that's it. I love the look, feel, and can't wait to hunt with it this year. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking to change out their standard factory stock of their 740 or 7400."
3,Nice product,The monte carlo is a little high for a 742 woodsmaster if your going to use the iron sites. But works just fine for a scoped rifle. Really lightens up the rifle as well.
4,Good Read,"I bought this, along with the Wenk guidebook, in preparation for a John Muir Trail thru-hike in July 2009. I recommend both books. Castle provides a nice overview of the trail, plus he recommends a specific itinerary, with the number of days & places to camp each night, which is quite realistic. I found it very helpful as a point of reference when planning my own (which was similar to his, though I didn't often camp where he did.) If you take one guidebook (or pages from) on the trail, however, take Wenk's. She gives more detailed information, particularly the location of all possible campsites, which is especially helpful if you're not following Castle's exact itinerary.But for folks back home who want to follow your John Muir Trail hike from their armchair, Castle's book is the better choice, and anyone planning to hike the trail should read his, regardless!"
3,Great ideas. Hard to Read.,"I read this book because N. T. Wright said it was one of the most influential books in the formation of his thinking about Jesus and Scripture.A word of advice for people who are thinking of reading it for the same reasons: Just read N. T. Wright.Sure, I could see how this book was formative in Wright's thinking, but Wright says it with so much clarity. Meyer was a great scholar, but his book is nearly unreadable. It is extremely scholarly and many of his arguments follow so many rabbit trails, they are nearly incoherent.N. T. Wright ends up saying many of the same things, but in a much clearer, concise, and readable way."
2,TINY!,"If your looking to make tiny cookies then i suggest you to buy these, other wise dont bother. I bought 3 different cookie cutter disigns and they were tiny."
5,Accel Black Wire Set,"First I must admit my opinion about ACCEl wires is biased (smiles). I've been buying their wires for years, but have been stuck on yellow until the last set when I tried black. If you are like me, you love tinkering with your drive train. Problem is, it does not take much to ruin the look of the Accel yellow wires. The black...well, less time wiping them down after engine adjustments and other maintenance...plus the top of my engine is chrome/endurashine along with everything else, so the black wires look good! Oh I forgot to mention the most important part, Accel Wire performance is outstanding. I only replaced the old yellow set because they had all sorts of stains."
2,"Some interesting concepts, boring storyline.",The title sums this story up fairly well. Some interesting concepts may keep you turning the pages but the novel is unremarkable in every positive way I can come up with. I was often left wondering if the authors heart was in what he was writing. In the end I didn't plan to quit reading it but found myself picking it up less and less until it got kicked under the bed and vanished for a few months whereupon I had zero desire to finish the last 100 or so pages.
1,This Year's Hugo Winner -- You Read it Here First,"I had to read this thing twice for business reasons, so this review acts in the way of payback.This is Wellsian didactic SF on the kindergarten level. Intelligent Neanderthals turn out to be bisexual, atheist Canadians, and are willing to tell us about. And tell us about it. And tell us about it. Passage unto page unto chapter. (And just think--this is the beginning of a trilogy.)If that sounds like your thing, go to it. Otherwise, your time would be better spent reading... oh, the government-mandated cooking directions in chicken packages. You'll learn a lot more of value there."
3,Ok,"Great idea, but the book drags quite a bit. It is a little irritating to always be reading books where every possible civilization is better than ours."
2,Flat and dissapointing,"Although Sawyer writes competently I gave it 2 stars for failure to live up to possibilities. Two humanoid societies interact after 40,000 or so years of separate development with differing histories, cultures, values, etc. What happens? We obsess about the characters and love lives of Mary (the human) and the Neantherthal (whatsisnameagain, he looks like Arnold without the chin), a couple of boring representatives of their species. ""Harlequin"" as another reviewer labeled it, sounds right.I think Sawyer's desire that things turn out right prevents a sense of danger or conflict that might make things work. I kept waiting for the Pentagon to start war-gaming the possibilities (you could send an army over in New Mexico and have it pop up in Beijing for instance), for the Neanderthal vs Human championship(Neanderthals win), but all I got is this unrealistic plot and goody-goody philosophy.Oh well, back to the Martian Chronicles, Dune, whatever."
2,Average..could have been so much more. 2.5 stars.,"This book caught my eye a while ago, and I'd been dying to read it since it seemed like such a novel concept. Sawyer's treatment of the subject is average, though, with little excitement and a simplistic plotline. Not to mention an unnecessary love story. It's a very easy read, despite the detailed discussions of religion, morality and quantum physics that pepper it. Perhaps because these are mercifully cut short just shy of becoming wearying.If you are looking for an exciting sci-fi thriller with an intelligent *story*, not just an interesting concept, this isn't it. Nothing really ""goes wrong"". For a casual read when you have nothing better to do, it's all right. Think of it as a 12-year-old's science fiction book."
2,unconvincing and tired gender-roles,"The concept sounds great but....The world building was not that great for the Neanderthal side, I was left wanting more. The book was heavily concerned with the role of gender in creating a society and the impact of male violence, yet it wasn't even a good discussion of the subject. I found the portrayals of the people unappealing, characters didn't feel very nuanced. And the exploration of their justice system was cut short with the allusions to its downsides never really dealt with.There is lots of postulating about the beginning of consciousness and the role of parallel universes that was unconvincing to me. I couldn't understand the Neanderthal explanation of how the universe was created. Also, I tend to lean towards the some animals have thought and culture side which this book does not and uses to further its explanation of parallel universes."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book because it was a Hugo award winner, but was disappointed.It lacked much insight and exploration of what could have been a fascinating topic -- i.e., the differences between Neanderthal and Homo Sapien societies.The ""crises"" that arose -- infections by diseases not shared by both worlds, the attention from the press, etc -- were unengaging.The last straw was the growing romantic relationship between the Neanderthal scientist and one of his ""handlers."" Seemed to be developing into a romance novel rather than good science fiction."
3,Solid,"This is an interesting twist on the parallel worlds theme. In this book, the inadvertant consequences of an experiment in quantum computing propels one of the experimenters from his world to ours. The catch is that the scientist is a Neanderthal and comes from a world line in which Homo sapiens died out and Neanderthals became the dominant hominid species. Most of the book is devoted to an implicit comparison between Neanderthal culture and ours. Neaderthals are not religous, have a strong sense of duty/ethics, very tolerant in many important respects, largely non-violent, egalitarian, and environmentally oriented. Neanderthal society is a sort of updated Enlightenment rationalistic utopia. This is fairly well done but a bit predictable. The author, Robert Sawyer, is a Canadian. This book, like most of his work, is set in Canada. An amusing way to think about this book is to view it as an allegory of the differences between Canadians and Americans."
3,three and half stars - a quick entertaining read,"Much more ""fiction"" than ""science,"" ""Hominids"" is one of those breezy scifi books for which one needs to suspend belief and not demand too much sense from. (The concept of a ""parallel universe"" always runs into problems). Since I'm fascinated with Neanderthals, the story was fairly compelling for me, but you would learn alot more about these fascinating creatures by googling it and finding a scholarly article. The characters are cookie cutter (even in the Neanderthal world) and none of the concepts introduced are particularly thought through carefully. Nevertheless, for this genre ""Hominids"" isn't bad and I might even read the next two in the trilogy."
3,Simplistic and Facist,"Under developed characters slog through over-rendered, dubiously explained environments with an meager plot. Basically, this is a rather facist oriented tract that appears to advocate conformity and totalitarian control as an ideal. It is just a readable but unexciting diversion."
4,tea party ( teabaggers),I hate tea party members. How many of you freaks believe in invisible men who make things happen by snapping their fingers. This was an interesting book. Not bad at all.
5,The best book I've ever read,I fell in love with this book as soon as i read it. It was masterfully crafted.
2,"good science,Poor storytelling","its the scientific ideas that make this book worthwhile.The storyline and narrative is quite thin and uninspiring, although the characters are quite well drawn.Don't know if I'll bother with the sequels however."
1,Not A Great Novel,"I really did not enjoy this novel. It contains a gratuitous rape scene.It is boring and silly in parts. Many factual errors are found throughout the book: a kind friend should tell Mr. Sawyer that Schaffhausen is a canton in Switzerland, not a breed of dog.I threw my book away."
2,Incorrect science!,"As an anthropologist who loves to study early and extinct hominids, I was very disappointed in the science of this book. For one thing, Neanderthals DID have a slightly large cranial capacity than us BUT they had less developed frontal lobes (reasoning ability). With less reasoning ability than us, it would be absolutely impossible for them to create a society as complex as Sawyer made it. Also, they had a less complex language center in their brain, so there was no way they could have such a well-developed language!With that said, it would be a fun read for people who don't know a lot about Neanderthals. For people who do; I would stay away because the annoyingly incorrect science of this book is both distracting and frustrating."
3,Decent but preachy,"Hominids is as simple as a tale about quantum theory can be. Ponder is trapped, and his lover Akidor races against time and the Neaderthal Judicial System to save him. The story is often entertaining despite some glaring holes in plot and logic. My biggest gripe is the thinly disguised/blatant preaching about how bad the human race is. Apparently, Neanderthals don't have crime, war, bigortry, religion, or endangered species; many of the concepts are difficult for Ponder to even understand. The humanns Ponder interacts with often seem embarrassed to explain humanity's faults.It's a quick and easy read, and I still enjoyed most of it which earned it 3 stars. However, if you are a bisexual athiest environmentalist pacifist you should get this book immediately; it would probably earn 5 stars from you, and your opinion of the world will be reinforced."
3,A Hugo?? (Really?),"The story is passably interesting, but I can't imagine how this could have won a Hugo Award. The only explanation is that they were awarding its peurile, naive and frequently simplistic political bent/bias.It's fairly entertaining, but rarely very suspenseful. And yet Sawyer's writing is always so smooth and effortless, it carries you right along.p.s.: Sawyer's account of the 'first contact' is also far too similar to his other novel: ""Calculating God,"" Which has a similar account of an Alien visitor reaching earth for the first time, and interacting with a team of friendly (and chatty) scientists."
2,This pretty much sucks,My wife orders this because from the picture and some of the other reviews it looks pretty good. Once we got it home and mounted it we quickly changed our minds. I gave it 2 stars because it is very strong and fairly easy to install. Those are the good points.The frame is designed with a large space on each side that serves no purpose I can see except to expose all the wires and prevent them from remaining contained in the casing. The holes for the wires to pass through are so big you see every wire inside & out and they also permit the wires to easily fall out.We took it down after taking the time to mount it and tried to line the case with black felt to conceal the wires. This thing is going on ebay tomorrow. You can have it cheap if you hurry.
4,"Solid, looks nice","I got this to put my oversized Sony 400-disc DVD player on it. I pretty much could not fit it on any other rack but this one. This thing holds it nicely now. It looks very nice, too. I have it in a living room. It was really easy to install, about 30min."
2,"Good design, bad quality control","I like the design. It looks solid and it doesn't stick out when you put your components on it. This is why I bought it. However, the 4 holes on top and bottom don't align with each other. Only 1 screw can fit the top and 1 screw fits the bottom. I have to use my own smaller screws to patch the other holes to make it not rotating. Could this be why it's sold at a discount? Buy it at your own risk."
3,beware of color,"Good quality, but the color is not really brown. It reminds me of the color of coffee ice cream, a bit dull."
1,Not a good price,"The product is good. I've used them for years. Normally you can get a pack of 25 strips for around $6. When I saw this had ""32"" per package for $5 I figured that was a good deal.It's not a good deal. It's a terrible deal.There are only FOUR (4) strips in the package. Each strip has 8 spacers so they're claiming there are 32 in the package. This is NOT the correct way to mark this product.So in a regular (full price) brick and mortar store you can get 25 strips (8 spacers each) for $6.In this listing you get 4 strips for $5. That's a pretty awful price."
3,"Few of the selections are revelatory,","Other pieces are entirely ordinary, such as stories on the global ambitions on Starbucks and Wal-Mart Stores and one on Time Warner. Some are downright bad, such as a piece from Fortune about hedge funds, which attempts to mystify rather than explain the hedge fund gods, only to admit at the end that there really is no mystery, just money.Not one concerns the building of a business or the story of an entrepreneur"
2,100 pages of info in 400 pages,"It's not that the things in this book are wrong, it's that they are merely common sense, and there is a -lot- of repetition. Hey, if you're hiring people, you might want a contract. If you're starting a business, you might want an accounant. If you're making a game, you need a plan first. The polls have about sixty respondents each, and only two or three projects are examined 'in-depth'.On the plus side, it is helpful to see some industry jargon in context, and to know what some publishers will expect to hear within 90 seconds if they're going to take interest in a product.Bottom line, this book should not be 400 pages long and cost $40. You can find a lot of this stuff on message boards, or by just asking a programmer how his day was."
1,Too many problems and crashes,"There were too many crashes and system freezes when I installed this card (ATI & Voodoo have worked great on my system). Since I know my way around in computers, I was able to resolve some conflics, but problems keep cropping up and I decided to return the card.Also, 3D quality is good, but 2D quality is not up to the mark as compared to the voodoo."
1,VERY BAD CARD!,I bought this card hoping it would be better than my Voodoo2. It was for a while but then it started to crash and my computer froze almost every time I turned it on. I fixed some of them but gave up and returned it. My new card works much better.
4,Some bugs but a nice card,"Not a bad card at all. I have a celeron 266, and I am running all kinds of high demand games without too many problems. OpenGL freezes if you are overclocking or if you have the AGP aperature size too high. In Windows 2000, OpenGL is slow and choppy. Using Direct3D, games run smoothly. If you have Windows 98, OpenGL gives great textures and colors to everything. I have never had a lockup outside of a game. If they solved the OpenGL issues, this card would be a great buy."
2,nice book but costly,"hello it is nice book , but if we also get it in CD then it would be much more better."
3,very shiny,"It was delivered quickly and without any problems. It fit great. Good quality. The only problem - it was to shiny. The picture appears to be a regular green jacket which is what I wanted (flat color). The jacket I received appeared to have a clear coat on it, to bad it was comfortable."
1,I was not impressed,Guess you get what you pay for. I found the material to feel like cheap plastic I would put over my plants in the winter time. The lining is ok but the fill and texture of the rain/windbreaker is cheaply made. Just not impressed. Going to try a different brand and probably donate this one to a homeless shelter.
3,Disappointed,I was really looking forward to receiving this product. It is beautiful but when I tried to install it I found out that it is too thick for the switch to stick out far enough to use. I kept it and am trying to figure out how to adapt it for use. It sure is a disappointment.
3,Needs to be updated,"The switchplate itself is very nice, however, it really needs to be updated with the latest rocker style light switches. This could also help with the dexterity problem - alot of the rocker style light switches are automatic turn on lights. I've emailed the company and asked them to make them ... hopefully they will get the hint!"
3,Not amazing,"This was a good movie, enjoyable and funny at times but not amazing. It was a relief there was nothing questionable in its content. I especially enjoyed the fact that she was a dance teacher, having been a dancer myself. If you don't like dance, you might not enjoy this film considering there are several dancing segments. There were no scenes and no words which was a great relief! The only distraction is Roma Downey's ""new face."" You can SO tell she has had some kind of botox injection! Other than that, it's a good film!"
4,Come Dance at My Wedding,"When bride-to-be Cyd Merriman considers selling her small-town dance studio, she discovers that her estranged father, Tanner Grey is listed on the deed. Meeting for the first time, the two must decide what to do with the studio and each other. As Cyd prepares for her wedding, Tanner helps by teaching dance classes. But fiancé Zach isn't as welcoming, and Tanner makes an uneasy decision. This is Hallmark/Lifetime production, with the sentiment and values associated with such. As long as that's not a problem, a very nice, small movie with good family themes."
4,good,It starts out a little slow but you still want to keep watching it to see what happens next with these characters. Plus the whole family can watch it.
4,A good relationship movie,"I enjoyed the way the father and daughter didn't know each other, but were able to relate. The actors were good at playing their roles, and it made you feel good."
5,Great movie!,once again I loved this Hallmark movie enough to get my own copy. Beginning to get quite a collection of Hallmark movies!
4,Sweet Movie,This was a sweet movie about coming to terms with the past and accepting one for who they are today and everyday.
2,I love schlock movies but like plots.,I love low budget movies but this one has little in the way of plot. It's hard to enjoy without that. It does have some gross effects though and is strangely engrossing as you try to find a plot. I have given lower budget flicks higher ratings but I can't say the plot situation is a good one. The dvd looks pretty good though and you get two movies here.
5,Ze return,"Well, it has been a long wait but finally...The sleeve of the cd immediatly tell us that AOL didn't age and they're still not to be taken seriously.Their cover version of 'Let the sunshine in' is nice though not very different from other covers except for a typically AOL break (Jean Pierre tell us that God must be believing in him - modest).The extended version is excellent (those funky sounds!) but the real remix sounds a bit cheesy after three times.The video is fun fun fun (and silly too) in the purest Army of Lovers 'Grand Siecle' style and it's a real pleasure to see them being stupid.This maxi is a must-have for AOL fans and for those who haven't heard of them before, it's time to be introduced to Army of Lovers (it couldn't be more apt)."
4,Good sunshade,"A rear window sunshade is a must have if you have a child who's still rear-facing but no longer in an infant seat (ie. no carseat sun canopy). It keeps the sun out of my son's eyes and I have also found that it keeps the backseat cooler in my Honda Civic so he's not roasting in the car. The color is actually black (not white as advertised), but this hasn't really bothered me. It makes your back window a little blurry, but I can still see just fine and a blurry window beats the heck out of an unhappy baby!PS The suction cups at the top have never fallen off the window but if yours do I've heard that super glue on the suction cups works great and you can just scrape it off when you don't need it up any more."
4,Great for the car!,"I love this sun shade. I am on my 2nd one by choice, the 1st one lasted over a year but has faded in the sun over time. I think its a great way to attempt to keep the sun out of the back of the car whether driving or parked. My only issue would be, because its universal, I drive a Maxima and would like if it was a bit longer on either side to better cover each of the 3 back seats. The sun shoes through on either side about 4"" and I have 3 children, so 1 may always have the sun on them."
1,POOR PRODUCT,"THIS HAS THE WORST SUCTION CUPS EVER. IT IS NOTHING MORE THAN A PIECE OF CLOTH, IT DOES NOT STICK, IT IS JUNKAVOID IT"
1,Useless,"I have a Honda Civic. The suction cups don't stay on for more than 30 seconds. If someone is sitting in the back seat, they have to keep re-attaching them. Most of the time, however, I'm driving alone with my son, so I'm back to using the carseat canopy for shade...which he hates."
2,Not that great,"I purchased this item for my son, as I do not have tinted windows and he graduated from an infant carrier to a regular carseat. I bought 3 of them (one to use on the back window, and 2 for the side windows) and I must say they don't work that well. Sun still manages to hit my son's face, making the car ride uncomfortable for him. Not only that, the suction cups on the sunshades don't stick very well. I'm constantly having to stick them back up every few minutes. Would I buy these again? Definitely not, and I wouldn't recommend them either. Keep looking."
1,Aweful.... DO NOT BUY!,Looks much nicer than it is! Does not cover the whole back window AT ALL! Flimsy and I never could figure out how to securly attach it at the bottom... so it just blows all over the place! Don't waste your money!
2,wouldnt order again,this product is the most unstable product I have ever ordered I would never order it again
1,Waste of money,I bought this to use in the back of a subaru wagon. It doesn't cover the whole back window...which is probably to be expected with a station wagon. However the real deal breaker was that it is a distraction. I think it would be too dark to use while driving at night. And during the day it was just a pain. You can sort of see through it but I didn't feel like it did my baby any good and I'd rather see clearly while driving so I took it down.
4,Glad I purchased!!,"This shade did not fit the entire back glass like I had hoped. Even though it covers most of the area, the sun still seems to find the spots where it is not covered. Regardless, I am happy with this purchase. It does shield my daughter's face from the sun and prevents her from squinting. I would defintely recommend to others."
3,so far so good,we have had this for about 2 weeks. i have a very small car and this item fully covers my back window. only cons are that its pretty hard to see thru my rear view mirror for cars
1,Product is not the one shown,I bought the sunshade because I thought it would be white on one side and black on the other (as pictured). It is all black and hard to see through.
3,Good coverage in '06 Mustang,"I was surprised at how small this actually was, but when I installed it in my car I found that due to the slant of the back window it was a perfect fit top to bottom. Since I drive a Mustang, my son doesn't sit in the middle, so I just placed it to cover one side of the glass. It takes some getting used to, but it does the job."
4,Worth the money,"I bought this product ending July and for the 2 months I've had it, it's been great at providing shade from the sun to the rear seating area. The suction pads that holds the screen have stayed intact since I first installed it, another plus for this product. Not only does it shield the baby from direct sunlight, I've noticed that the interior of the car is much cooler than when I wasn't using it during the daytime. The downside though, is that it reduces visibility and also blurs images seen via the rear view mirror during the daytime and very much so at night. Overall I will recommend this product, since it does what it's intended for, at a reasonable price."
2,Don't waste money,This is the second purchase of this shade. I really found that it protected my son the first time with no tinted windows but in my new vehicle that has slightly tinted windows it does nothing to protect him now. The suction cups do not keep the shade up either. The fabric is transparent enough to see during the day and night. I would rather just pay to have a darker tint put on my window than to buy this again.
1,Won't work with hatchbacks,I have a Toyota Prius which is a hatchback car. This shade just hangs down but you cannot secure it to anything on the bottom.(It has two tabs that are suppose to squeeze between the back seat and the back panel most hatch backs have a big gap there.) This is not a big deal until you open your windows and the shade starts flapping all over the place.On the plus side it did cover the whole back window.
4,Almost Perfect,"Provides great area of coverage. Entire rear window is blocked from sun & it really does filter sunlight well from my rear facing twin infants. I say ""Almost Perfect"" because it took a good 2 weeks to get the suction cups to adhere properly. However, once a good ""suction"" was made, the haven't budged. Snug fit, does the job."
3,The final one - again!,"This in a way is a sort of throw away Highlander. Repeat the standard story - Connor up against an evil Immortal, Connor's girlfriend is threatened, Connor wins. However, I found the movie quite enjoyable. There are hordes of inconsistencies - Immortals trapped in a cave for centuries all talk in English, a Chinese warlord played by a black man, Mario van Peebles, etc. etc. But the fights are good as are the supporting actors, particularly Mako as the Sorcerer. There are nods to the original story and the final scene on the mountain when Connor lights the candle for his wife is touching. Again this movie states that it is the last one - 'It's finally over.' (actually no, it's not by a long shot!) Not the best movie but one could do worse and Highlander fans will enjoy it."
1,el premio mayor,"i am so mad with amazon.com, why do you people put that this movie has english subtitles when you know very well it has NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES, this is not the first time or second time this has happened to me, please do something about this somebody."
1,Where's Lorena?,"The ""A: side of disc 3 was full or errors, i.e. it stalled frequently and would not play in some circumstances. This was evident on the first playing and was not due to any surface damage on the disc.The original version shown on TV had several scenes with Lorena Herrera, although she was not what you would call a major player. Almost all of these scenes have been omitted, so skip this DVD if you are a Lorena Herrera fan."
2,Not much good,"They never printed another manual for the Tracker because not much can be repaired on it. It can be replaced, but not ""fixed"" as such. I got the book to help me ""fix"" my transmission. So the book says "" ... take it to a shop or professional transmission repair."" Thus, they are a source of advice, not a reference for repair. The book is filled with useless information and a TOTAL waste of money."
5,Chock full of great tips on making bread,I have gone back to making bread. This book is very helpful with tips to make the perfect loaf of bread. Great purchase.
3,an uneven account of a college coed's decent into madness,"'Hangsaman' is not one of Shirley Jackson's renowned spooky stories. It's a very personal, perhaps autobiographical?, account of a young woman who completely loses touch with reality as she endures loneliness and alienation as a freshman in college. Other than having emotionally deficient parents the cause of her despair and madness is not clear. And so despite being well-written and evoking a strong sense of intimacy Ms Jackson left this reader somewhat bewildered and non-plussed with 'Hangsaman'.Bottom line: a strange yet unaffecting piece by the horror master. For loyal Jackson fans only."
4,Nana Hannah's Piano,"Piano playing kids can also be good baseball players ! What a comfort to a youngster who feels he is different from others because he has to practice the piano. A good read - aloud book with active, brightly colored illustrations. Both the team and the music are winners !"
5,Cuts the Term 'Conscious' Into Digestible Chunks,"In the introduction to this book, Lycan isolates no fewer than eight uses of the term 'conscious' and fifteen candidates for what one might mean by 'the problem of consciousness'.Lycan's points are clear and direct. One always knows _exactly_ what issue is being addressed, which is no small accomplishment in this field."
2,F.P.I.Doesn't Answer,"I'm really not too surprise that F.P.I. doesn't answer ! The excitement of the outline of the story and the general format of the images suggested by the cover of the DVD lead me to expect some fascinating visuals 'of the future'. Unfortunately there was very little in the film, as produced and designed' too back up any of my epectations. All the settings were very ordinary and the idea of the floating aircraft landing island was completely undeveloped. In comparison to earlier 'si.fi' films, like 'Metropolis', 'Aelita, The Queen of Mars' etc it was very poor and very disappointing. The German version was a little better than the American but, unless you want to take an interest in lost opportunities I would advise - move on to better things. Sorry."
3,missing glass pieces,i bought this thing and the glass trays did not come with it i will never purchase a peerless product again unless the send me my glass piesces
2,VAGUE INDEED,"This book was very loosely written. It touches on the subjects and leaves you hanging. If you ever wanted to cite anything from this book, you'd be hard pressed to find anything useful. Unfortunately, it was a part of my curriculum to use this book for my Masters."
4,Practical guide to aircraft design,"Many aircraft design books detail the 'how' of aircraft design. For example, determining the stall characteristics of a conceptual aircraft design. John Flemings' book introduces the 'why' of the aircraft design process. This book is a perfect companion to other aircraft design texts, like 'Aircraft Design-a conceptual approach' by Daniel Raymer"
2,No substance,"I consider this book to be a rough draft for a much larger book to come (I hope). The author just skims lightly through vast numbers of subjects, so that anyone who knows anything about airplanes will learn nothing new. Yet it isn't written on a basic enough level to have much to offer someone who knows nothing.Disappointing."
2,Skimming the Surface,"This book is a very general view from a very British perspective. I don't think it belongs in Embry-Riddle's graduate programs because it does not meet the needs of experienced professionals. As an undergraduate overview of the systems design process, it is good. However, the author does not even touch helicopters, seaplanes, or lighter-than-air-technology. So, the book would be more aptly named ""Introduction to Airplane Design.""Some of his information on armament systems is grossly inaccurate. Furthermore, the systems design process section does not reflect the current state of the art in the discipline of Systems Engineering. I expect improvement in the next edition and hope the author makes more of an effort to talk to engineers on the other side of the pond."
3,Introduction to Aircraft Design,"Leaves way to much for the imagination. There was not enough details on how an aircraft is really design. The author covers this in the opening statement....there are plenty of other books that will give you specifics, this gives you an overview prespecitve."
3,Appendices are the Best Part,"I agree with one of the other reviewers, that this book is rather brief in its content, but if one takes it for he introduction book that it is, then one understands why there is little detailed info.The appendices are pretty robust though, and have some good tables with lots of hard-to-find info. There are appendices with formulas, scientific data, formula, conversionss, and there are tables with aircraft parameters and statisitics.The author is obviously a Brit and uses examples from Cranfield's past research as many examples used in the book.This book was required for Embry-Riddle's ASCI-603 Aircraft & Spacecraft Development.If you are serious about a book on aircraft design, and you really want to know what you'll need to know, or are serious about the field, save your money and get Dan Raymer's Aircraft Development: A Conceptual Approach (4th ed.). It's more expensive, but fatter than a Bible and practically a Bible in itself for the field of aircraft design."
3,good - not great,"""Shiva Dancing"" is a good book. It has an interesting plot, with development of characters but the story does seeem predictable. It is an easy read and is somewhat suspenseful in certain areas. What blew me away the most was the amount of events that happen in a short period of time in the beginning of the book. It brought me in - and made me keep reading. The ending was a bit of a let down. It is an OK book - it wasn't a waste of my time. I felt like I learned a little bit of Indian culture and the push/pull of belonging in one place or another."
2,Disappointing read,"This book started out beautifully- a wedding ceremony in desert India amongst 7-year olds. The bride- kidnapped and taken away by bad guys to the big city never to see her child/husband/friend again. And then- bam! We're in San Francisco with a very American main character named Meena who we're supposed to relate to as the child bride. But of course by now, she's educated, wears jeans and jogs, and has a great job in computer software. A Quantum leap into the future. Ms. Kirshner had the right beginning but took the story in the wrong direction. I kept reading the book, mainly because I was very interested in the Indian/Bengali cultural aspects of the story. Also. the ""caught between two cultures"" idea seemed realistic. The rest of the story ended up being a schmaltzy love story with a predictable ending. Everyone ""adjusted"" way too easily to the conclusion. Disappointing at best."
3,A dissapointing read,"I feel that I must agree with the reviewer who describes this as an immature first novel. It feels that way when you read it. Too many unnecessary descriptions that are irrelevant (I feel) to the main issues at stake such as dislocation of onself and ones cultural history. I agree that it starts off marvellously but it degrades into cringeworthy descriptions of marathon running, man hunting and computer programming. I find it hard to sympathise with the main character Meena who appears as a shallow, vain woman with no real sense or purpose. A dissapointing read."
2,Main Character's voice rings false,"The novel starts of with a bang and promptly loses itself in weak harlequin romance-type prose. As an Indian-American woman that is Meena's age, I found Meena's character to be utterly unrealistic. Meena's voice was not that of a woman that migrated from India between at age 7, but rather of an Indian immigrant my mother's age (or Ms Kirschner's age) who obviously idealizes the India because it was home. The about-face in attitude towards India that Meena experiences towards the end of the book is abrupt and not consistent with the character as she is described. Neither the story nor the manner in which it is told is praiseworthy. An example of the pitfalls a first-time author falls into..."
1,A book that begs to be put down at each and every page.,"I did my best to finish this book, honest. But this is one book that is so utterly boring, that it begs to be tossed out of the window. The author is not able to depict either India nor the US accurately - as an Indian American I could not identify with either of her descriptions. There are too many unreal coincidences and loose ends in the story. There is this weird feeling that the author is contradicting herself in every chapter. If you really want this book, I have one to give away."
1,This book is an appeal for ratings lower than one star,"I was so excited to read this book that I actually waitlisted myself at my university's bookstore. What a let down. Perhaps after the Rushdies and the Roys and all the other highly literate Indian authors I've just discovered, my hopes were just too high. Shiva Dancing, had a wonderful title, and that is the best thing I have to say about it. The romance (and I normally adore romances) was tiresome, the main character was a little too fond of her red sari, and had little to no respect for, or even knowledge of, India or Indian culture. Perhaps Ms. Kirchner should stick to the kitchen?"
3,Not too bad,Kind of predictable. Shades of Bharati Mukerjee. Good to read on a long flight to India. Characters need more development and plot is too cliche.
4,Couldn't put it down,"As a woman who has been in tech, I found this book a great summer read. Nice mix of Indian vs America culture, romance, intrigue. Some nice glimpses of San Francisco and dot com shenanigans."
2,I was glad to be done with this one,"This book is a bit to formulated for me, grabbing intro, proper introduction of the characters, story development, exciting ending. But it's very streamlined and predictable, no spice or extra anything thown in. It's more like a massproduced paperback - characters shallow and boring. The life she leads in the book seems very boring and dull, not worse writing about. Everything is very well phrased and to the point though. maybe she is more used to writing memos or computer manuals."
1,Shiva Dancing,"I picked up this book because it sounded interesting, not realizing that it was by the author of Sharmila's Book. If I had noticed, I would not have bought it. I found it to be just as simplistic and predictable. The characters lack any depth, and to say that the ""mother's"" journal entries are anything but racist and elitist is horrifying."
4,well worth reading,"An insightful book, very readable, sensitive, and real. It has a charm of its own. I look forward to reading more of Ms. Kirchner's work. It was time enjoyably spent"
5,Painful but poigniant,"This is where it ended for perhaps the best metal band (although it is an insult to limit the Wildhearts by that tag) since Metallica. During its recording the band was suffering the effects of the bass player's growing heroin addiction- the screamed lyrics of 'Junkenstein' could only have come from first-hand experience- the band broke up a week before this was released. Some have found the harsh production too much to bear- in places it is more extreme than a grindcore album- but the winning songwriting still shines through: after a few listens, the beauty of 'Soundog Babylon' is obvious, and the schizophrenic genius of 'Urge' still amazes. The final track 'Thunderf*ck' is arguably their finest moment- a flawlessly executed trip-hop experiment that segues into a violent blast that sounds like the world is ending- which it did for this fine and criminally underrated band."
5,It sounds a little bit like this...(shout the next bit),"BOOM! CLATTER! RATTLE! TEEEET! BOOOOOOM! CLATTER! RATTLE! TEEEEEEET BOM BOOM BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!! CLATTER! RATTLE! TEEEEEEEEEET! GRRRRRRRRRRR! BOOOM! BOOM! BANG BANG BANG BOOM!!!! RATTLE!!! BANG BANG BANG!!!!! BOOOOOOOOOOM BOOM BOOOOOOOOOOOM! BOOOM BANGABANG! BOOOOOOM RATTLE CLATTER TEEEEEEEEEEET! And that's it. It sounds like Psychocandy by the Jesus and Mary Chain, and is incredible. Buy it now. You WILL think that your tereo is broken - And that's a good thing."
3,No complete Z-Transform table,"While this edition is up-to-date with the current information, certain things, like the complete Z-Transform table were taken out, leaving with in place, a basic Z-transform table with only 10 transformations. The previous editions of CRC's Standard Mathematical Tables had complete Z-Transform tables. If you need a complete Z-Transform table, I would recommend looking into the older editions, such as the 27th edition, instead."
5,Fantastic reference book. Wish it had more external references.,"This is a very comprehensive coverage of a broad array of mathametical standards.Sometimes a mathmetical concept or premise is best understood if you have multible references. This book serves to provide information to those who already have some underlying knowledge to the topic they are referencing in the book - a highly successful implemtation of the primary stated purpose of the book.The only improvement to this book would be the inclusion of references by the author to primers or underlying concepts that better represent the purpose and utility of the materials presented. Such as a ""See Also..."" or ""For more information on this see..."" under each major topic section. That way the author doesn't need to waste time and effort for topics which are not in the intended purpose of the book.Self improvement and lifelong learners use these books too."
4,"Still great, but somethings missing","This is still a great resource. However, this edition leaves out many of the tables (though a calculator will generate them) and the information on basic geometric shapes (e.g., volume, area) is difficult to use as a quick reference. The book puts too much emphasis on analytical geometry which makes this version harder for engineers to use. Still is a great value."
5,Reference book,"This is a must for mathematicians, engineers and students. I appreciated very much this uptodated edition. I had an older one (16th).J V Detoni"
4,CRC,"More tables than you could ever want. Could use a little more detail on things such as tan, cos, sin tables instead of just every 5 degrees."
4,"So far, so good...","This product was recommended by a friend. I haven't seen a mouse since I put it down. I only used about a spoonful behind the stove, where there may or may not be a hole. IT SMELLS AWFUL! YOU WILL HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE ONCE YOU PUT IT DOWN. I suspect it's because it's really supposed to be used outdoors."
1,Didn't Solve the Problem,I tried this product twice and didn't solve the problem. I had voles in my lawn put the product out as directed and it did not work.
1,this is a scam,we had rats in our garage and bought this product in good faith. imagine our surprize to find that the rats were actually attracted to this product and seemed to prefer to leave their dropping where we had put the granules. i suppose they were laughing at us for buying such a stupid product. we got exterminators in to do the job correctly and they also had a good laugh when we showed them the product container. buyer beware !!!
1,Mice were not bothered at all..,"This product didn't work for us at all. Our mice had no issue to even walk over the stuff! After having tried a lot of products, we're finally back to the only remedies that seem to work: wipe the floor with chlorox (so mice can't orientate according to their own urine tracks and marks), put all edibles away and keep trapping them with traditional mouse traps (BTW: they hate cheese - try peanut butter and bread). That's how we finally got rid of them."
1,My use of Shake Away,"I tried the Product as instructed and instead of running the Squirrls awaym I think it attracted them becausae I now have more Squirlls not less, I ask a Credit and will receive one for the item but lost the shipping and handling fee, which is not right in my opion so instead of getting rid of Squirlls, I lost money!!"
1,Shake Away is a waste of money,"I've been battling a rat/mice nest in my engine compartment for a month. I was hoping this would solve my problem. Unfortunately, they have pee'd and pooped all over this stuff. Considering I placed more than a quarter of this bottle within my engine compartment, this stuff obviously has been a waste of money. On to the next attempt at a solution I suppose."
4,Product received as advertised.,The product was received as advertised. So far it seems to be working. I will have to give it some more time to determine whether or not it is more effective than mouse bait.
2,Did not work for me,"This product did not work for me, as the mice did not stay away, and I put it down several times before giving up. I followed the directions. It just didn't work for me. I found it messy, too. You have to get up the old product before putting down the new or you wind up with a lot of this stuff all over the house."
4,SHAKE AWAY,"After putting this product down around the outside of my house, I notice the yard was empty of rabbits and squirrells! But we did spot a field mouse in the house but dealing with catching the critter! It is working pretty good but we will see if it ""REALLY"" works."
5,Works!!!,Cannot find these locally. I wanted to scare away field rats and possums but not my cat and dog. This item worked perfectly. The shake away at the hardware stores are general repellants. Not for me
1,Did not work for me,"Well if I allow my small dogs to smell this, they run away from it, BUT when sprinkled around (half the bottle) around the areas where there are rat dropping and the top of the wall (in the attic) where the rats climb up, it does not appear to stop them at all......"
2,Small Critters Calling My Bluff,"I have not used this particular product for RODENT control.I HAVE used the SMALL CRITTER Repellent (same brand) for chipmunks and bunnies etc. That has only been partially effective. It has not dissuaded the critters to move on. They seem to come back after two days and call my bluff. I think it is because we have only lived here 2 years now and they have been ""in (under) residence"" for a much longer time. I wanted to use a humane type product like this but this one is just too expensive per use and I have not gotten the results I was hoping for. I am down to my last 2 jars and I have already used 4 without success. I won't order it again.It is a shake product but the consistency of the product is somewhat moist and so it really doesn't like to ""shake"" out through the holes provided. The larger opening dispenses it too rapidly and one can use up a bottle/jar in a hurry."
4,Not Sure,I am not sure right now how well this product works. I shook the granules around the house and I saw Mickey twice. I also have a Rat Zapper which I know its avoiding because it saw what happened to its buddy. My three year old left a piece of bacon on the floor and it was there for three days without me knowing. There were no signs of mickey nibbling on it so I guess it works.
1,Worthless!,"This summer I had rats in my garden eating my tomatoes for the first time ever. I was able to catch about three of them in a rat trap until they became wise to that. Being desperate, I looked for some other cure and read positive reviews for Shake Away Rodent Repellant Granules here on Amazon. So, I tried it.Don't waste your time or money! This stuff was totally ineffective! It sounded like a plausible idea, but it does not work. The rats pay no attention to it whatsoever!"
1,Don't Waste YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!,"Shake Away Repellant is a joke. It did not work as stated. I was trying to remove a nest of raccoons in the basement and it simply failed to work. Simply stated, you would be better off NOT using this product."
1,Did not work!,We were having problems with rodents getting into our cars which were parked outside. We sprinkled this around the cars every night. 5 days later both cars have check engine lights coming on and hundreds of dollars of damage caused by chewed wires. My husband opened his car hood yesterday to see a rat in there. This product did not work at all.
1,I think the mice used Shake Away as a condiment!,"I liberally sprinkled this product on the ground around my vehicle, and also put on some of the flat surfaces inside the engine compartment.Recently I noticed some mouse damage to the heat/noise insulation under the vehicle's hood. On closer examination I found the the mice had actually packed many acorns along with a significant amount of Shake Away granules into the nest it had created in this insulation.So much for it being a rodent repellent! Besides smelling horrible, to humans at least, this product does not appear work."
1,did not work,"We followed directions - mice still around, mouse droppings in the granules - cannot recommend"
1,Useless,The product was delivered fast. That is what the one star is for.I have used the granules as directed but our squirrels are not impressed. They seem to even try the stuff and it doesn't deter them at all. The product has clearly not worked as promised.
4,"A kinder, gentler Cato Salsa? Well kind of..","This album showcases CSX's semi-new sound, less thrash and more jamming. Each song is well balanced and initially I found them to be much less powerful CSX's first album (a good tip for a good time). I guess you could say that they dont rock as hard, BUT! After a while this new album gives you a itch that only THE FRUIT IS STILL FRESH can scratch. Basically it has a very unique sound that cannot be found anywhere else. The vocal harmonies on this record are so catchy that you will be singing for days. I gave the album 4 stars only because it is new and I need time to evaluate its staying power. Hopefully CSX's american label will release this soon because it is a very worthwhile ablum that would do well in the states. Anyways, as with their first album Cato Salsa keeps the toes tappin', the hips skakin' and the head bobbin'. Buy this album and ROCK!!!"
2,Copy/Pasted Server 2000 book (barely for 2003),"Although the book has a 2004 copyright, much of the info is dated. Tables are referred to as for Server 2003, but the tables were obviously made for Server 2000 and simply copied into this book. Table 3.1 is a perfect example, referenced as the command line switches for the mbsacli.exe command, yet the table is titled HFNetChk Switches (the authors couldn't be bothered to do anything except copy/paste this info in). This is a common thread throughout this book, obviously NOT written for 2003, but a slightly updated (making references to 2003) security book for Server 2000."
2,Agree with the others,"Amazingly lazy effort. Some of the data, like basic security concepts, are universal (the definition of a ""threat"" is the same, regardless of OS) but after that this book is... well, saying it's a ""retread"" is being nice.The screenshots in this book even still refer to Windows 2000. Chapter 3 has a very nice ""System Properties"" screenshot that says ""Windows 2000, Service Pack 3"". Going by that, it's not even completely up to date on Windows 2000.If you're looking for basic security concepts, this book should be alright... but there are better options (like anything Security+ related). Unfortunately, this was my first Sybex book... and will probably be my last."
1,Outdated and horribly written,"As mentioned in the previous review, most of the text and diagrams reference Windows 2000, despite the book being titled for Server 2003. After using Sybex books to pass the core requirements for my MCSA cert, I was eager to use this one for my elective requirement. However, the book is written in a very non-technical manner; the text as well as the review questions are vague and even incorrect at times. I have found a few obviously incorrect statements / questions that will be submitted to Sybex as errata. For once I'm glad I purchased the Microsoft Press book on this subject."
1,"Outdated, will not help you pass the exam.","Just took the 70-299 exam and failed. Only the 2nd time I have failed a certification exam ever. (first time was my fault, this time it was the material). The exam material is far beyond what this book covers. Buy a newer version."
3,Good learning tool but not a total answer,Use this for my MCSE but you need to have a really good reference book to go with it to have all the information you need for the exam. The Microsoft Training Kit is a better investment.
1,Problem hair dryer,"I went out on a limb and purchase this very expensive hair dryer.Since my stylist used it in his salon, I thought I was purchasing a very good quality dryer. Well, I've had it about 2 years and the heating element has broken. I cannot find HaIonic anywhere on the web to see about a warranty. Anyone know how/where to find them to get this fixrd or replaced?janemcguire@verizon.netThanks"
4,You need this book if you are serious about marketing,You need this book if you are serious about marketing. Seth Godin does a great job of outlining the various mechanisms behind word-of-mouth advertising in today's world.
3,Not so interesting,"It was a text book for my e-commerce course in AGSM. Not so interesting, and my lecturer did not quote much from this book."
5,Great addition to Permission Marketing,I enjoyed the new book. It was better than Permission Marketing.
3,Interesting ideas,"Very interesting ideas that helped me think of marketing in a different way. I found that many of the examples were dated, as the book was written before the dot-com crash. We really returned to a business as more usually model than anyone thought we would at that time. However, still some very valuable ideas. They were a bit over-stated and the book is a bit repetitive, but still some good value."
3,No beaming light inside,"When you see the cover you think perhaps an idea will emerge or a bright light will blind you with promise. Well, not quite. The book is a pretty good read - won't take long - and does give you some framework to think about interacting with people / customers via the web. If you happen to be really into the topic it will be a non event. If you are trying to get a handle on it as a neophyte then it is worth the read. ..."
3,Good But Not Great,"Offers some good advice, but there's not too much here that's either new or revolutionary. I read the book over a long period of time, with a break of several months right in the middle, so that no doubt affected my reading experience, but I did find the book a little rambling and sporadic."
2,Unleashing the Idea Virus,"This book was probably good was it was new, but it was full of examples that were very dated and it was hard for me to focus on the concept with best practices that were ten years old."
4,Great from a Viral Marketing standpoint,Great from a Viral Marketing standpoint. Godin's advice is always simple and easy to understand for me. I take golden nuggets from all of his books. I recommend.
4,Infect Me With The Virus!,"Starting my own dot com ([...]) for the first time (as opposed to running traditional bricks and mortar businesses as I'd done in the past) I knew I had to read as much of Seth's work as I possibly could. Unleashing the Idea Virus was right at the top of my list. Seth yet again spells out simple easy to understand ideas illustrated with fabulous examples. Yes - the book is a little out of date now with its references - but it's also pretty fun seeing which of Seth's predictions have come true! I'd recommend the read for any business owner or marketer looking for the answers to the question ""how can I get people talking about my business without laying out a mint on traditional interruption advertising""Kirsty Dunphey, AuthorRetired at 27, If I can do it anyone can"
3,Enteraining but nothing really new,"A quick, fun read. But I think there's viral marketing books out there with more useful content."
5,Filled with Lots Great Ideas!,"There are lots of really great marketing ideas in this book. To implement them is a different story. You have to have a big imagination, plus lots of creativity to emulate the super successes found in the book.I noticed that many of the other reviews seem to think that Seth is going to give them a step-by-step system how to turn their idea into an idea virus. Reading this book with that expectation you are going to be let down.Every situation is different. You have to connect the dots. You have to apply the ideas in this book, it to make it work for you. You get the idea. (No pun intended)Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated"
5,"The TRUW value of ""free""","I was blown away by how this book makes the idea of giving services away for free, not just logical but the most strategic thing a smart busines person could do to build her client base.Twenty pages from the end of the book I threw it down, pulled out my company's business plan and redrafted the income model. I'm very excited as I await feedback from my accountant and some other business advisors...If necessary, I'll buy copies of ""Unleashing the Ideavirus"" for each of them."
2,Permission Marketing again,"This book has the same ideas of Permission Marketing. It's like reading the same book. It's a shame, because the author has been getting famous with his innovative ideas and speaches."
3,Pre-dot.com crash advice predominates,"If you want to understand the process of how an idea is easily spread via Internet, this book is interesting indeed. But be aware that it was written BEFORE the dot.com crash, when the general thinking was that great name-recognition was more important than profits. Godin actually recommends that you give everything away for free, that the money will come in later. I was disappointed that the book so closely followed the model which proved to be a failure: I have millions of web site visitors, but no income, I must have a great business here! It is an interesting book if you are a non-profit org and/or literally just want to spread an idea. If you are trying to make a profit, read this with a grain of salt."
2,Sorry Seth,Sorry but this book is copy copy copy of his first book and The Tipping Point. It is obvious that Seth is a student of the Peppers and Rodgers write the same book over and over again club.I would not be so irate other than the price of the book is so obsurd that you expect more value. Spend the money taking your spouse to dinner.
2,Hyped up referral based marketing,All Godin has done here is add a few bells and whistles to the basic referral or word of mouth marketing model.Essentially this is what the book says:1. Create a product or service that is so good people will want to talk about it2. Get centres of influence to use your product and recommend you to the people under their influence (even if you have to pay them to do it)3. Make it easy for people to recommend and use your productHaving said that the price was right (you can download it for free)!
2,"Less idea , more viruses","I don't know those five stars viewers were paid sneezers or volunteer sneezers. This book quite like University student's thesis, little bit ideas (digitalized old ideas), a lots of them just ""viruses"" only."
4,Makes you think,"All of those who read this book in order to find a formula or even a guideline are in for a disappointment. This is not a textbook, this is a book written to give one an idea. The book does not teach you how, or why, it opens up a whole new way of thinking and gives the reader new directions to embrace change, and follow new ideas in order to take the business in a new direction.This book has given me many things to think about, I view the marketing department in a whole new way, and as someone who has a say in the company, I even bring out new ideas which break the mold and take the company into a new direction.This book has given me the tools to come up with those ideas."
2,Much Ado,"Seth Goldin states the obvious when he explains in this manifesto that ""word-of-mouth"" advertising works. Unfortunately, his manifesto is just that - too many words used to state the obvious. He differentiates between word-of-mouth and his concept of IdeaVirus, but his IdeaVirus is just a sort of controlled word-of-mouth driven by our access to the internet and e-mail.Mr. Goldin kept coming back to his central theme that advertising is wrong-headed. It may be true that his sort of virus is the most effective way to promote a product, concept or service. However, Mr. Goldin never offered a concrete way to start the spread of the virus. He states, ""There's so much clutter, so much noise, so many ideas to choose from that the vast majority of them fail to make a dent"". That seems to be his point.I found the text rambling and uninformative. At 197 pages, it is certainly ""Much Ado about Nothing""."
2,Seth takes credit for Memetics,"I picked this book up to see if there were any new ideas under the sun. At first I read along hoping to see some original thought on marketing ideas. I quickly realized I had heard of this 'ideavirus' concept before, only it was called memes before.The book makes a very sloppy stab at translating the science of Memetics into a 'revolutionary' marketing strategy. This would be fine had it succeeded. A workable introduction into the marketing implication of Memetics would be a very valuable tool to anyone trying to propogate an idea. However this book fails in accomplishing that goal. As it stands the book simply creates a feeble representation of Memetics, rebrands it as the 'ideavirus' and proclaims the author as head of a revolutionary new marketing technology.I started hoping to find some new ideas under the sun. This was not to be. The book earned its place, and that place is where the sun don't shine."
3,4 stars for content & 2 stars for organization,"Unleashing the Ideavirus offers practical ideas on how to spread a marketing message without spending alot of money. Some of what Seth Godin describes may be more common sense than revolutionary. However, he does present several fairly sound approaches to marketing and taking advantage of the concepts of Malcolm Gladwell's Tipping Point (a 5 star book and one of my favorites).My main problem with Unleashing was the organization of the book. Unleashing the Ideavirus was a bit disjointed. It does not flow as nicely as the author's Purple Cow (by way the a 5 star book!) which I would highly recommend."
4,Conquer the World...Again!,"Every great marketing idea creates a new set of consumer defenses. The real trick is to stay several steps ahead of your competition and keep the ideas new and fresh.Seth Godin offers some good advice, realistic overviews, and usable tactics to help you get and stay ahead with ""Unleashing the Ideavirus"".Whether you want to step up your online or offline marketing, Godin will get you pumped to go out and conquer the world...again!"
5,'Purple Cow' is remarkable! MOOOO...,"Well... The book 'Purple Cow' gets released only May 12 but I was lucky to receive a copy through a special offer. This new book of Seth Godin is a remarkable piece of achievement with lots of potential and reach. It is about being remarkable or risk being invisible! It tells the importance of innovative marketing strategies. You will love every page of this book. Actually, you will fall in love by just looking at the book! I completed reading this book in a couple of days as I could not stop reading it. I recommend it to everyone and give it 5 full stars. Be noticeable by noticing this book May 12. I can't wait to see this book come out and make wonders!"
4,Promising,"I wanted to give 3 stars for lazyness, but there is a potential out there. I found only 6 out of 12 songs good to keep. The foundation is out there, but the house is not finished. It looks like an empty wall painted with primer, but there is no paint. Ramirez picks a theme, plays it ""correct"" but is not building on it. A bit of more hard work, and maybe we'll see something in the future. Oh and by the way, the last song.. which started so great, ends miserably with unwelcomed vocals. The style is totally ruined with the use of vocals. A faded, background reverberated naration would fit better. Also there is missing the use of more sound effects, nature, water drops, wind, exotic instruments (think native nz, think indian, kurdistan, oriental, south american effects). Put some aroma and spice on your work, Mr. Ramirez."
4,Cool music,I was listening to Pandora and came across this Artist and instantly liked his music. Can't wait to hear more of his music.
4,"So far, so good!","I bought this book as my first ""big"" respiratory medicine textbook and I have to say it's very well done! The content is pretty up to date, it's simple and practical, easy to read. The images are amazing and they come in PDF on a companion CD free with the book... perfect for PowerPoint presentations. It's not absolutely complete... but no pulmonary textbook is! If you're just starting in respiratory medicine, get this textbook first!"
5,Beefy TEES are great,"These Hanes Beefy TEES with pocket are the greatest! They are available at most Walmarts, but only in grey and black. The choice of colors and size coupled with the GREAT price is the best."
5,Very content,I had a little problem with the order because the order was made during the holiday season.I was compensated for the inconvenience.I will definately be doing bussiness with this company again
1,Not Happy,"I have at home quite a few large t-shirts bought over the years from different manufacturers including Beefy-T(Hanes). They're all great t-shirts. I just bought 5 of these large t-shirts from this vendor but I can tell you these are not large. They seem to be a half a size smaller, like in-between medium & large. So all 5 shirts do not fit me. Also, the weight of the fabric is not heavy by any means. These are light weight fabric. My advice is, if you must buy them, buy one size larger than you normally get, but as for me, if Hanes is gonna try & increase their profit margin by giving me a substandard product, they aren't going to ever get my business again. And I have to add that my employer buys us Beefy-T's every year, and they aren't cheezie like these are, so I don't know what's going on except to say I'm really unhappy with my purchase. If you want to know which t-shirt I ended up with that is a fantastically good buy, check out my other reviews."
2,The Universal measurements for small just got smaller.,"I bought this shirt at walmart years ago, fits great, my favorite t-shirt. i still have it actually with holes in the arm pits and all over it. fits perfect, so i wanted to replace it with the exact same hanes beefy t in the same size thinking it would fit the same. Wrong, the new shirt i ordered was tiny and when i washed it it got even tinier. next time ill just go to walmart its cheaper anyways."
2,Sizes an issue,Long time wearer of Beefy-T's. The last set I bought were at least 2 inches shorter for the same size (XXL)... C'mon Hanes...
5,Men's Light Steel Teeshirt,I ordered my husband some gray teeshirts with pockets. they are getting very hard to find. I was pleased with the color and quality. They arrived in a timely manner in good shape.
2,Tee shirts seem to wear quickly - lose body right away.,They came in great colors but they seem to lose body quickly.They came in great colors but they seem to lose body quickly.
1,Small and thin,"These shirts run small; I had to return them.Also, they give the impression that they are heavy weight. They are not."
3,Poor Quality Assurance on Sizing,"I purchased this to match one I had bought last year, same size and color. Both of the labels matched, ""Hanes Beefy-T XL(46-48)WG/TG"". But when you compare the shirts, the new one is 2 inches longer and 1 1/2 inches wider than the older one. Maybe the sizing standard changed from last year, I don't know, but based on the size of this shirt I could have gotten a large. I guess the good news is I can say I am a ""size large now""!"
2,Not the old Beefy-T anymore,"Be advised that you can probably get the beefy tees for less directly from Hanes, as I did.Also (a big bummer) over the last few years, I have received a tee shirt that is notas thick a material as it used to be. I have worn beefy tees ever since I had asign company that also did silk screening on just about anything, and we used to order only the beefy tees as they were a better T shirt than any other, but this wasthirty years ago, and the product has definitely changed no matter what Hanes or anybody else says. I don't have a problem with the sizing as others do, and at $9.00 each with pocket directly from Hanes, it is still a good deal.Addendum:Contacted Hanes and gave them all the sorted details they ask for in hopes youwill not E-mail them back (Color, where they were made, price, etc. etc.).All a bunch of bunk when they have my order number.This is nothing more than Corporate greed, just like Levi, Maytag and so many others."
3,Beware,I can only comment on the XXL size; they run small and then shrink considerably. For me that works out good as I need something between XL and XXL. The shirts are comfortable and they fit well.
2,it's way too big,"i didn't know the word ""beefy"" was a size issue. i thought it was more of a discriptive quality issue, so when it arrived and my whole family could wear it together i wasn't happy"
5,Beautifully Written,This was one of the most fantastic books I have ever read! I love the way Ms. George trys to see what is would be like from the Dippers' point of view. Keep up the good work! Dipper (*v*)
5,May the force be with you!,"My grandson absolutely loved this toy.He is only 3 and a half,but is a true Star Wars fan."
2,Not a fan..,"I wanted to love this sling since it's so pretty. I watched the video several times, and tried to get my daughter into various holds several times, none of which she liked. I think it might be ok if your baby is very small and wants to be cocooned, but once they start looking out, not the best sling. I also have the Moby, and she loves that!"
3,Not that great,You still have to hold your baby up because they could swing forward pretty easily. Seems to run small. Wrong pattern recieved as well!
1,disappointed,The video is only ten minutes long and is made by the educational video network. It is a biased piece of work.
3,Musica Tejana,"Pena's book is full of a lot of good and well researched information. My biggest problem with the book is that it's so terribly dense. I'm of the mind that you can be informative and compelling in your scholarly writing but yet still be accessible to many types of people-- not just other academics.It's important for people to see themselves in history in order to feel as if their history matters. Music can be, after all, one of the most democratic forms of expression and therefore is an excellent method by which to connect to people.Pena's book doesn't reach out to would-be students of Mexican American music-- it sits in a stuffy university office and waits for the students to come to it."
5,One of the very best books ever written!!!,"This book is written in very beautiful language, and with deep thought and insight into spiritual principles based on the Word of God. It brings the life of Christ to life in the mind as no other book has ever done for me. It has taught me so much about the character of my Redeemer. It can be read and reread with great benefit to one's spiritual walk, and grows deeper all the time, just like the Bible! So good!!!!"
2,"Look for his other books, don't buy this one","Please consider my suggestion before you decide to buy this book.I recommend you consider buying his other two books instead of this one.""The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership""""The 21 Most Powerful Minutes In A Leader's Day""|-POSITIVE-|I can't say anything positive about this book, I was shocked to see this author repeat same information written in other Maxwell books.|-NEGATIVE-|I read 5 of his books on leadership, and they all share very similar information. If you read his other books, you will not find any new ideas here. This book badly repeats what's in his other books, and its written by some guy Jim. The writing style of his other books are much better as well. I advice that you don't buy it, just look into his other books I mentioned above."
4,Influence = impact: focus on being right and the doing will come,"This book addresses impact, how to measure your potential contribution and how to plan your efforts to achieve those things that you are uniquely created to do. Here are few of my favorite quotes:--In most cases, those who want power probably shouldn't have it, those who enjoy it probably do so for the wrong reasons, and those who want most to hold on to it don't understand that it's only temporary.--Each day do what you should do before what you want to do.--And like animals, people need to be cared for, not just physically, but emotionally. If you look around, you'll discover that there are people in your life who want to be fed--with encouragement, recognition, security, and hope. That process is called nurturing, and it's a need of every human being. If you desire to become an influencer in others' lives.Start by nurturing them.Reinforce what you already know to be true: seek to serve and stay focused on what you do best."
3,Real life examples but unremarkable overall,"I am a fan of John Maxwell's work - Just not this book. I have read/listened to John's books ""Today Matters"" & ""Thinking for a Change"" and really enjoyed both very much.Although, ""Becoming a Person of Influence"" had many real life examples the content overall was just lukewarm.Not bad, it just suffers by comparison to his other works."
4,Again a great work,"John Maxwell again provides a great work that helps the leader within you see what it takes to remain there. In short, do the work. While your doing the work, help others to do the work with you. Improve yourself and bring others along for the ride.This is also a good book to review before an interview or any time when you have to sell yourself."
4,A Person of Influence,"Integrity is the center theme of this book, and although most of the suggestions are very basic, they are well worth reviewing. Good leadership book."
1,Repeat!,"I love John Maxwell's books. He is a great author and his principles of leadership changed my life. However, this book is just a repeated information of his other books. Same information repeat over and over again! Other books are better."
5,Manditory Reading,"Physics without math is written at a mathematical level that a bright 11 year old could understand. The subject matter is in enough debth that even students that have taken college physics before will gain new insights. Shapiro has a gift for showing the big picture where you really do follow the thought process. Most importantly however, if the book was dull, you would not read it even if it was very educational. This book is the one that I have been reading at night for fun. Now when I find that a book ends up on the bedside stand, and next to me while cooking, and at the table at meals...that book needs a positive review. Get this book, then after this one if you havent already read it get Hewett conceptual physics. If you enjoy reading science, then this book is for you."
4,Works fine on my 5 gal and 6 gal carboys,"I bought this elsewhere, but it looks like the identical product. The center hole fits tightly around a 3/8 inch OD racking cane. I set up the cane, then use a pump with a taper fitting to apply pressure through the side tube and push the wort out the racking cane into either the secondary fermenter or a bottling bucket. It is a great way to make transfers. This does not fit my 6.5 gallon carboys, which have a larger, threaded top."
1,fits loose,this cap does not fit tight and lets air in and out and doesn't let the water lock do it's job... i'm really disappointed in this product
3,good informatiom food for thought,I bought and read this book . it has some good points and ideals some information i was unaware of. all in all it was not a waste of money but a good asset to add to my book collection.
1,Not worth the money,"I was desperately looking for a way to ""love and inspire my man after prison"". This book just disappointed. There is no real help or advice given. More like a blurry story. Without being too sarcastic, love itself doesn't fix everything. I don't want to write too much personal stuff here, but I guess most of the people who are in my situation can feel with me is when I say,I wanted help and I needed help! What to do when your man doesn't believe in himself at all? What if he can't find his way back into society after being locked away for a decade? What if he can't stand people being close to him? What if he can't commit as he learnt to never trust anyone for so long? I think that's what women who buy this book wanna know and this book is not gonna help you. For me it was a waste of money buying it and a waste of time reading it hoping for answers or advice I never got! Think twice."
1,I no longer use this reference.,"In reading the other two reviews of this book, I am dismayed. I am also somewhat surprised given the usefulness of other Steadman's publications. This particular book has so few surgical words that I look up that I no longer even bother. It is more frustrating and a waste of time than helpful. I hate to say this, but it is my experience."
2,"Useful as quick entry point, but no more","The book is useful as a way of getting an overview of Acrobat 4 commands, but is short on the concepts behind them. I found a number of errors on the Windows side of things (p26 - A double click is needed to view pages, not a single click; p48 - EPS files will not work as a basis for 2+ page PDFs; p96 - incorrect illustration; p132 - over-complicated radio-button technique for form).I wasn't convinced that the authors had spent enough time getting to know Acrobat 4, which is a good product."
1,"Couldn't get it to work, can't get support","This MAY be a great card, but for the life of me I couldn't get it to work. My system has an integrated graphics adapter; I couldn't get the VooDoo3 3000 card to run in anything except VGA mode. Now for the kicker, I went to their web site and it seems 3dfx is no longer in business. Their FTP site to download updated drivers seems to have vanished..."
5,HELLO VOODOO 3!,"I just recently purchased this card and I have to say it is a bout 1,000 times better than my old card it was so easy to install and I had no idea it would work so good. The resolution was outstanding and the sharp 3D texture was overwhelming this is definetly the best pci graphics card out there. And if you have a pentium II 250 mghz or higher I highly recomend this card. It was definetly worht the money."
2,Dont Bother with it,"This was a great card when I bought it 2 years ago, unfortunately it is no longer compatible with new games. Voodoo went out of business and drivers are no longer available to update it. Games like Jedi Knight:Outcast take much too long to load saved games and the graphics have other problems when the game is running. Spend a little more money and get something that isn't already antiquidated."
2,Not Compatible,"This card has compatibility issues with everything! Ghost recon, some Need for Speed games, and others don't comply with this graphics card.If I were you, I'd settle for something a little more reliable, unless you are never going to use your computer for gaming."
1,"shame on you, shame i have to pick 1 star for this junk","shame on you for charging $100 for a box of dog crap...how can you even fathom this video card is worth more then the S&H it costs to send it to the noob you sell it to? i would suggest you go buy a clue...this card is older then my grandma, i would take the $100 and instead of buying this card i would suggest you get a geforce FX 5700LE..this card is 10000000000000 times faster and better..thank you and good nite"
5,"HIghly recommened for older systems, excellent card!!!!","This was a state of the art graphics card back in 1998 or so when it came out. I owned the Voodoo3 2000pci and the Voodoo3 3500tv agp. They did come out with 5000,5500 and 6000 series right before Nvidia purchased the company. This video card was fast, flawless graphics, and at the time the ""big dog"" with 16mb of memory and a 183mhz clocked core. Now a days, this is very outdated, but still good for anyone who has old systems and craves to see games like need for speed hot pursuit, doom, nascar legends ect... in awsome fast graphic speeds. Highly recommeded, a very nice graphics card."
2,Illogical but interesting,"The logic this book uses is bad. For example, Hart states that everyone, not just members of one religion, should have a say in how government works. In a different chapter he says that it's O.K. for a majority to make the entire decision (as long as it's a Christian majority, of course). As a secular humanist who believes that religion should be tolerated but not encouraged, I recommend this book as a way to gain understanding of why fundamentalists often suffer from brain atrophy. The reason why I gave it two stars instead of one is that despite its lack of logic, it is well written, and the history itself is very interesting, particularly the section on the Quakers."
4,Good product,"These mini cookie cutters are about the size of store-bought animal crackers. They are so small, though, that some of the detail of the animal is hard to see and hard to get out of the cutter. They cut well and have a rim on the top side of the cutter that protects your hands from sharp edges."
2,SO SO,"OK, so they are cute but are basically only good for pastry, like cutting pie crust for a decorative pie edge. I wanted them for actual cookies. Although you can cut them out and bake them as sugar cookies, the shape is lost so small."
5,Cute Shapes,"These shapes are so cute, I couldn't pass them up. I use them to cut out fondant designs. To wash, I rinse them with water then set them on a paper towel to dry - I haven't experienced any rusting yet."
4,Great,"This is a great album. I ordered this for a friend some years ago. Unfortunatly I don't have a copy of this and he passed away just this past weekend. He will be missed by many. Rest in peace my good friend Dan Patrick Dietrich of Quincy, Illinois."
3,Flash memory card slot,"PDC-700 is a good camera for the price, however battery consumption and flash memory slot are two problems I am faced with. This camera devour batteries like there is no tomorrow, fully charged rechargeable batteries will last maybe full day. The other problem is the memory slot will not keep the flash card in place, whenever I turn on the camera error message will come up, ""Card Error"". I have to remove the card and push it back in to clear the error message. Other than that not a bad camera for the price. To avoid buying batteries constantly I have to remove the batteries from the camera when I am not using it, such a pain but the only way."
2,Entry level Digital Camera. Not too good.,I bought this camera because at the time it was a decent price and it looked good. Here is what I ended up finding out:Pros:Decent pictures and a good size LCD screen.Cons:Can't use it for long periods without replacing the 4 AA's.There is no zoom.Uploads are slow to your computer since there's no USB.Only holds 24 photos without an extra memory card.Changing the flash for indoor/outdoor is hard to figure out.I advise spending a little more and buying a camera with better features. In the long run this is not really a good investment.
2,2002 Camera completely out of date,"Have had this camera since last xmas.Camera for the price paid and what it is at today is totally unacceptable.NO ZOOM, 0.8 megapixels, grainy photos even at high settings, low grade CCD that displays very slow, battery life subpar, 20 second delay between shots, no USB, low-tech power switch, no lens cover, inferior viewfinder that takes in no light very hard to see thru...."
4,Nice Camera,"My friend bought me the PDC700 for Christmas, and I love it! We first bought an Argus DC2000, but the picture quality was so bad, it wasn't worth the money he paid for it. We did a little research on the Polaroid and liked the pics. When we got it, the software and all the extra cables etc. that came with it, have made it a pleasure! The PhotoMax software works great and you can do some fun stuff, like put peoples' heads on other bodies! It works great and I haven't had one ounce of problems with it. I recommend it highly. One more thing..when you press the shutter button, it flashes and takes a picture instantly...no waiting and no fuzzy pictures! Don't use the LCD display unless you have to...it will drain the batteries FAST!"
4,Great Beginers camera,"Love all the cool stuff that comes in kit,very little documentation forces playtime.Wish it had a zoom.Reviewing pictures on full size tv is a great feature.I think it's a keeper"
4,Discrepency,I am in the market for a digital camera for under $250 and have read all the reviews on this camera. I was just at the largest discount department store in the country and saw that the PDC-700 DID HAVE a serial and USB port. Did Polaroid see the falw of only having a serial port and add a USB connection to their camera without changing the model number? Check this descrepency out before deciding on a camera because if the PDC-700 you find does have USB and SERIAL connections then it is definitely a great buy.
4,Very good except for a few things,I had been givin this camera from my parents on my birthday. It a real good camera for the price. The only problems with it is that it doesn't zoom in and it doesn't load the pictures very quickly. So this is the camera to buy to get started with digital cameras.
4,Mine at the bottom of Lake Erie,Even though it is a little ackward to hold...it captured the moment instantly as soon as you snapped for a picture...most cameras I have found have a delay. I had no trouble downloading onto my computer...however the software it comes with does not e-mail pictures easily. Right now it is accidentally at the bottom of Lake Erie...and I am shopping for a new one.
4,Does the job for the price range...,"This camera is a good started to digital camera owners. Picture transfer is very easy however a little on the slow side. The biggest downside to this camera is it eats batteries, however it just takes regular batteries so they are easy to obtain."
1,Wasted precious money,Cannot take camera anywhere without being waited down withbatteries. It got to be ridiculous to be changing batteriesso much. Never got the Photomax to download .I sent it back to the company. They sent it back to me and it has never worked since. Wish I could get a refund. It is in the box with all papers. Directions were too complicated also.Can't afford to buy another one. Afraid the same thing will happen and I certainly can't afford that. The store where I bought it doesn't even handle the product three months later. Does that tell you something?
2,quality control,"This is my second camera in 6 months, the first had problems w/ the on/off switch malfunctioning and using batteries at the rate of 6 pictures to 4 batteries. Also had problems w/ the screen not coming on after taking a picture or when pressing the screen button. On the second camera have the same problems as on the first w/ the exception of the excessive battery drain. Am thinking of changing brands. Bought both cameras at Wal-Mart., very nice people to deal with."
2,Worst Image Quality I've Ever Seen,The quality of the photos taken by this camera are terrible. Each one is grainy and that is even with the super fine setting. Other than that the camera is really nice. Comes with all the cords and software you need. If you're looking for high quality photos go with another camera.
3,mega break,"i got this at target for an okay price. i spent 30 minutes trying to put a few pieces on. if you had to get a building set, get lego. i would not suggest buying this as a gift. it was very hard to put together, and survived a few minutes of playing with."
4,Young American Buddhists,"I'm a young American (20-something) and I am so happy that someone is finally paying attention to my generation of practicing Buddhists! This book is interesting whether you're a young person just discovering Buddhism, or an older person interested in the new spirtiual motivations in youth culture today. The only weakness I can mention about this book is that it does not cover a wide range of Buddhist traditions. I wish, for example, it had included interviews with young Buddhists in the Soka Gakkai tradition which is one of the most youthful schools of Buddhism I know of in the United States these days. In any case, I am just glad someone finally published a book like this one. I also highly recommend a little gift book written by a 20-something American Buddhist named Taro Gold called ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Eastern Wisdom."" I hope more and more young Buddhist voices will be found in print in the near future."
4,You Can't Help But Like This Guy.,"This book really caught me by suprise. I expected and got tales of corruption, drug smuggling and dodging the law authorities. But, what I didn't expect is to find a guy, highly educated and someone that you could easily invite to dinner and enjoy his company. Mr. Nice is the tale of Welshman 'Howard Marks' and his involvemnt in the smuggling of 'cannabis' and 'hashish' globally. His stories are humourous and his exploits sometimes naive. The writing is very good and the book moves along at a pace. There are some heart-breaking personal consequences to enjoying this type of life and he has suffered to this extent also. He is a likeable rogue,is not violent and did not get involved with hard drugs but what he did was illegal and did hurt those around him. All said and done, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and does give you an insight both into the man and the drug-trafficing trade of the 1970's."
1,This book is Pathetic !,"This book is pathetic! Do not waste your money on this literary abortion! Howard Marks does not know the difference between reality and fanasty. He calls it an auto-biography! Marks makes the reference ""I smoked a lot of grass"" about 300 times, on every page, it gets old. I have no doubt the drugs have caught up to this man. The book could not prove it more! He has below average writing skills, and brags about being an ""Oxford Grad"" that is so intelligent. I do not want to waste any more time on this review. Advice- Save your money, period!"
5,Suspensful and Sexy,"This book was so good. It had passion, drama, suspense and a whole lot more. I feel like I am in the story with the characters when I am reading Monique Gilmore's books. She has a way of drawaing you into the story. I could hardly put the book down. Definately a good read."
5,Great message for anyone interested in healthcare,"There have been few books that attempt to look at the nonclinical side of medicine with any creativity. This book by Drs Klasko and Shea takes a science fiction approach that acts as a perfect backdrop for lessons about how to handle the changes in medical care. The concept of getting abducted by aliens is how many physicians view the current scenario. I applaud Drs Klasko and Shea for attempting to mix this ""Star Wars"" type plot with an optimistic message for people involved in medicine"
5,Keep your mask on,"Used these on my mask in the Philippines during several snorkeling excursions. They were perfect. I usually find myself letting a little water into my mask so it can run across my lens as I swim. But this method also invites salt water to my eyes.I purchased three sets of magnets and lost one magnet during my return the first trip out. Glad I purchased extras.They are simply strong magnets, like earth magnets, covered in a protective material so they wipe, not scratch. They are easy to use, push out of sight and you never have to surface to use them."
1,"Horribly Crafted, DO NOT BUY COASTER!","Purchased this Coaster natural wood frame at a local furniture store and within 6 months the entire front has split into 4 pieces, making it completely unusable. Very poorly made and will never spend another cent on a Coaster furniture product. DO NOT BUY! Instead, try walmart for their shoddy 100 dollar metal futon frame that might outlast this junk..Waste of money, AVOID!"
5,Works for me!,"I had mildly elevated cholesterol, 2 months of exercise and improved diet increased HDL, but did not decrease LDL.This supplement made the difference, still a statin like remedy, so have liver enzymes checked as you would for any statin medication.All good now for over a year. My plan of care..."
1,Actiontec better do some homework,"What a disappointment this product is, I would be ashamed to try to sell something like this. First of all the remote hardly works. To make it work you have to stand up to us it and sometimes hold over your head about 7 feet away and it may work after you press a button about 5 or 10 times. They don't advertise it has a very narrow view window. The instructions do not tell you about firewalls blocking the signal, browsing the internet is quite hard, no way to adjust the resolution to view the entire page. The unit I had would not transmit video thru the composite cableing. It would send thru component video though. The only thing good I can say is, is that they have a good idea and it would be very useful. Hope they take some constructive criticizing. Guess I'd recommend buying another computer and place it buy your tv or get a new system that features home media center."
1,What in the world IS this...?,"As a big fan of the Fight Night series, I expected this to be a great game. But noooo. They took everything good about Fight Night and flushed it down the drain, keeping all the bad parts and constructing an invention from scratch.When they proudly looked upon the garbage heap, they decided to title it Fight Night Round 2."
1,"-TERRIBLE-dont buy, rent","I rented this game.I created my guy, and entered him in the Heavyweight class.I went through the ranks with this guy, starting around rank 50, i worked through the guys,some stronger than others, i eventually reached the first place guy.So after KOing him, you get the heavyweight belt woo hoo, then you go down one weight class to light hevyweight,easier cause they dont have as much power,so then you get up to the 1st place guy and k.o him too.then you go for the Unified title, which is basically a really strong and fast guy, so i eventually k.oed him too. then you defend your titles until you lose them. then theirs not much else you can do,its not for friends coming over cause you need time to get used to the controls.i thought it was good at first, then you realize that you just wasted 20 hours of your life for nothing, not much entertainment at all."
3,"This game should be called ""Haymaker Boxing""","When I bought the new fight night round 2, I expected an even more realistic boxing experiance. I saw on the cover the new cut scenes, new fighters, better graphics. The problem is that the first fight night was more realistic. You could fight a smart technical fight, use your jab wisely etc.. The new fight night has totally ruined that experiance. The jab is useless.. all you do is try to avoid these huge haymakers that are more powerful than any uppercut. In the game, all they throw are haymaker combinations which are almost impossible to block. The person that gets hit by the most haymakers will win the fight. I'm a huge huge boxing fan but definately not a fan of this game. This game is definately not real boxing."
2,I SECOND THAT,"WHY, WHY, WHY I LOVED THE FIRST, THEY SHOULD OF JUST LEFT IT AL0NE. THE WORST PART ABOUT THE GAME IS THE STUPID ASS EARTHQUAKE THAT HAPPEN ASS SOON AS U PUNCH SOMEONE THE WHOLE SCREEN SHAKES, ?????????? DUMB! I GAVE IT TWO STARS JUST BECAUSE THE GRAPHICS ARE GOOD THATS IT."
4,great game,i have this game and its awesome. the only complaint is the instruction manual is inadequate.
1,Not a step in the right direction!!!!!,"Three steps forward last year with Fight Night 1, four steps back with this title. Greath graphics and.......... that's about it. Get's real old real fast. Fighting mechanics do not feel organic, difficult still, even with the improvements to throw combos and the using the fight stick has literally given me a blister on my right thumb. Rent it to see for yourself, avoid buying it."
4,Fight Night Round 2,"New to the PS2 World but this was well worth the $15 I paid for thegame. Boxing,graphics and overall game is very good. Would highlyrecommend it."
2,Review,I'm not a big fan of people shortening classic stories. I would much rather have listened to an unabridged version. There are a lot of details that are crucial to the story that is left out of these editions. I find this to be rather insulting to the authors.
2,Tonya,Shoes didn't look anything like photo. When I received these they were ugly. Nothing but glitter all of the straps. Picture doesn't give it any justice. I returned these.
2,Not at all as pictured,"Don't get me wrong, these are cute shoe but...They appear to be solid silver but are actually black with tiny silver (shiney) sequins covering straps with black stiching. They are alot more ""formal"" than I originally thought. I bought four pair for my bridesmaids and fortunately it is an evening wedding so they won't be too glittery and ""disco ball"" for the occasion."
4,Gun Vs Die AFT! - Gattai Blu-Ray Movie,I really liked the animation w/ in these series.The blu-ray finally allows viewing it in higher quality XD
2,There's no Jumbo Krill in JumboKrill,"I am disappointed in this product since it claims to contain jumbo krill and I found the size of the krill are small. Plus, they crumble when you touch them. I don't think I would ever buy this product again."
5,Tetra Jumbo Krill,"This is great food, My black arowana loves it. Its gives any fish superb color as well. Plus youd pay double the price in retail stores."
1,Waste of money and time,There is only 2 tutorials and this information is available from After Effect. This young boy displays everything he doesn't know about AE. There are many places to find great tutorials for AE and this is not one of them. Chris and Trish Meyer have in depth books out with footage that are great. Total Traing is another good resource for AE training. Save your money and don't buy this junk.
1,Horrible.,"Don't buy this video. It's incredibly low-budget, unprofessional and poorly produced. You can't even see what the user is clicking on because of the screen resolution. Find tutorials on-line for free. AVOID this."
4,TY Panda Bear,I love the panda bear. It's small and soft and cuddly. My son loved having it for his project.
2,Can this really be true?,"I'm a big fan of Errol Flynn and his wonderful string of adventure and western movies of the late thirties/early forties. I'm really disturbed by this book, labelling him a liar, a cheat and,worst of all, a traitor. A Nazi collaborator, if not a spy and gestapo agent. But the true measure of the man is in his movies. And I would like to believe that Flynn the actor had something of an resemblance to Flynn the man, just like it was darn near impossible to seperate John Wayne the actor and John Wayne the man. This book is not, as Highman claims, heavily documented, but rather the other way around. Flynn was an adventurer, alright, but he was certainly no Nazi spy. And just before his death, he was almost branded a communist due to his last, very awful, movie ""Cuban Rebel Girls"". Let's remember Flynn as a truly great actor. Whatever his shortcomings as a private man, they are shared by all of us. Flynn was one of the greatest."
1,The book is an absolute fraud.,This is one of the worst biographies ever written about Errol Flynn. The book is an absolute fraud. The information is mostly from Higham's paranoid imagination that see a Nazi under every rock. The author also has misquoted his so-called declassified documents in order to weave his many slanders and lies.
3,for theErrol Flynn addict ...,I received the book like it was advertised: used.But that's ok I really wanted to have it.Received well inside the timelimit too.
1,Untold?,"Or rather Made Up. Higham's book is fully readable, but it lacks truth. Higham is probably the proto-James Ellroy, who takes real persons out of Hollywood history and wraps them in fiction.This book is well written but that's it. The whole Nazi spy/homsexual angle has been exposed as a fraud by the late, great Tony Thomas. Do yourself a favor and borrow this book at the library if you want to read it. Don't buy it.""It's not a book to be tossed aside lightly, but rather thrown with great force..."" -(...)"
1,Nothing lower than one star?,"It's a pity Mr. Higham didn't explore fiction as a means to make his living, as most of his writing seems to be comprised of mostly fictional accounts and very little fact. I truly believe that Mr. Higham intends, at first, upon writing a biography, but seems to get distracted somewhere between the last hit of whatever he's smoking and actually leaving the house to do any form of research on his subject. The Flynn book, if nothing else, is entertaining in its sheer fantasy alone...particularly the scene where Flynn flees the arms of his married lover and dives several stories from her window. If you're looking for comedy, ""Errol Flynn: The Untold Story"" holds at least a laugh a page."
1,A Coward For Writing About The Dead,"I have read this book and some others by Higham and a common thread runs through all of them.. the Nazi Spy theme...in one The Dutchess Of Windsor and her husband were to have had connections to the Nazi's,and Higham must not know much about the Nazis to begin with,because bisexuality and homosexuality were considered to be a sign of inferiority and reason to kill, people who were not ""perfect"" according to the Nazis would face death.I doubt the Nazis would have a bi-sexual spy working for them,and by the way,Flynn has not bisexual or gay,does Higham profess too much?"
1,CRAP!,"If you're already an Errol Flynn fan you know the history of this book. If you're a new Flynn fan, looking for a biography about his life, avoid this load of crap by all means! It's just an author making shocking facts up to sell books with no truth to them whatsoever. 'The Spy Who Never Was"" discredit's pretty much all of the Higham book entirely. Check out, first, ""My Wicked Wicked Ways"" ,the autobiography, ""Inherited Risk"", and then ""Real Life Rouge"" that comes out in Feb.2010. (hopefully)"
5,Solve the case and save wear and tear on your thumbs,"Very thorough guide to all the steps you need to take to master this violent noir thriller.Detective Max Payne returns to fight the crime world. Love comes calling, as the gumshoe's heart is under siege as well this time.Helped me beat some of the hardest puzzles in the game. I turned to the guide whenever it seemed like I was stuck at an impossible spot.Max is one of my favorite video characters. This game is a rare intelligent thriller. If you're tired of the same rocket-launcher binges against the same monsters and aliens, get into the murkiest world of all: the criminal mind."
5,Nice outdoor sub,"I purchased this sub to go along with 4 Tic tfs6cn8 for my yard, I have it hooked up to a Speakercraft 8 ch amp and I do hear more bass with the sub hooked up. I plan on bridging this sub at the amp for more power, but overall it's pretty good. Tic does have bigger subs if you think this wont fit your application. The sub also has 2 pass through wires so you can add another sub or speakers directly off of this sub."
3,Two perfect tenses are incorrect,"Buyer Beware. By her examples on page 202, this author clearly demonstrates that she does not understand the present perfect and the past perfect. The reader/student will need to look elsewhere for guidance. If you want specifics, drop me a line at br dot hadvines at yahoo dot com. These are important and necessary tenses and should be understood by anyone who writes or speaks English. I don't own the book and wouldn't buy it. I'm surprised the publisher put it on the market. Buyer beware."
5,Almost thrilling,"Even if I wasn't a homeschooling mom having to teach my daughters grammar I hope I still would have discovered this treasure. The neatness of the grammatical system of the English language is what shines, but Vitto's sparse and accurate text inists on the readers enthusiasm. Fun."
4,Straightforward Guide To Grammar,"I am using this book in conjunction with Rex Barks: Diagramming Sentences Made Easy by Phyllis Davenport to help me get back up to speed on diagramming. My children are diagramming sentences in school, so I want to help them.This book has been an effective tool. The exercises are very helpful.I would recommend it gladly."
5,Just enough...,Not as good as my Klipsch Reference Series Speakers but they sure sound great for the price. Perfect match all around.
2,Cerwin Vega CVHD 5.1 sub-woofer issues,"I purchased Cerwin vega after reading rave reviews at cnet and other sites. I like the sound quality - produces great sound when it works.Noticed an issue with sub-woofer. The receiver volume has to be high for the sub to kick in and then it cuts off after about 20 mins if the volume setting is left as is. So watching a movie, the sub cuts out after 20 mins, then i have to raise the volume for it to start working again.Haven't yet called customer service so can't rate that."
4,Awesome sound for the right price,"These speakers were a great upgrade from the typical Home Theater in a box style fare of speakers, purchased for $499.99 plus shipping, i couldn't find a better 5.1 sound system for the price. If you pay the $1299.99 retail, you can find much better speakers in that price range. but for what they are selling for now, you can't beat it."
5,Epitome of laika as an art form,"Greek popular music of the 1960's by Manos Hadjidakis and Mikis Theodorakis became popular all over the world due to the success of two somewhat overrated films, ""Never on Sunday"" with music by Hadjidakis and ""Zorba the Greek"" with music by Theodorakis. Both composers worked in the ""laika"" tradition, Greek popular music influenced by European melodic form, and each had an ""angel"", a female singer, as a major interpreter of his music. For Hadjidakis it was Nana Mouskouri, for Theodorakis it was Maria Farandouri.Farandouri and Theodorakis had a life-long musical collaboration, intensified by their Leftist political activism. This album is the high point of that collaboration, and it should be more readily available than it is. It is a classic. Farandouri's voice is a marvel of depth and beauty, and the songs are among Theodorakis' best."
3,Liner Notes & Recording Quality,"The music on this album is really beautiful & is what I hoped for. However I was so disappointed that the album came with no notes whatsoever and the track listing on the back of the album is in Greek (which I dont read).The combination of an incredible story,Theodorakis's music & Farandouri's singing should surely have warranted a comprehensive & informative liner note at the very least - most disappointing! The recording quality on the second half of the album is very poor and takes the shine off what should have been a great listening experience. Anthony -Australia"
2,NOT GOOD.,ORDER THIS 2MTHS AGO FOR ME AND MY 2GIRLS WHICH ARE MIX BLACK/HISPANIC.THIS PRODUCT DIDNT DO GOOD AT ALL FOR ME NOR MY GIRLS HAIR AND WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN. WAS TO GREASY WHICH I DONT LIKE AT ALL AND DIDNT LEAVE OUR HAIR SOFT TO THE TOUCH. DIDNT LIKE AT ALL.ONLY REASON I GIVE 2STARS BECAUSE IT DO HAVE A PLEASENT SENT.OTHER THAN THAT BAD HAIR PRODUCT TO USE ON ANY HAIR TYPE.
2,OK,"This stuff smells amazing, but no matter how much of it I put in my hair, it ends up being way too greasy :( I'm not sure if this is for African-American Women or other hair types only, if it is I do apologize, but it is way too greasy for a normal to dry hair...it does smell amazing though!"
1,Maya Angelou video degraded,"This is an edited version of the original program, part of Bill Moyers' series on creativity. Some very important sections are omitted for some reason, and the trailer at the end is meaningless."
5,Good Stuff,This is a very good product. I was very pleased with the quality and the fast shipping. I use a lot of tape in putting on bandages so this is perfect for what I use it for. It was $1 cheaper per roll than I can buy locally so that was even better. Would highly recommend this for anyone who needs good adhesive.
5,"Compelling, truthful, and ahead of its' time.","The Awakening by Kate Chopin addresses the needs of a woman in a time when a woman was not allowed to have needs. Masterfully written and classically timeless, a true read for any reader. This novella can enrapture the inexperienced but wise reader or the immature but well-read."
5,Buy this book!,This is an excellent overview and history of helicopters.Very good photography and graphics supplement a comprehensivetext. Anyone looking for a great book on helicopters shouldbuy this book.
1,Lots of pictures and lots of errors,"This book has many worthwhile images accompanied by a large number of significant errors and pedantic captions. There are also multiple consecutive entries for a given helicopter model, very few of which add anything to the first entry for that model.This book suffers from extremely sloppy fact checking, incorrect technical explanations, and generally a lackadaisical treatment of a very interesting subject.There are plenty of other well researched and accurate books on helicopters available. Don't waste your time on this one."
4,Batman in his WHOLE world...,"Despite what some of the other reviewers of this book may say, this is not a traditional crossover featuring characters with their own franchises and combining them for an epic comic book. No, this book RE-UNITES just about all the major players from Gotham as they all come to Batman's aid when his city is hit with something much larger than he can deal with alone.I enjoyed this book for it's quite excellent art, and for it's exceptionally interesting plot line.If you are a fan of Batman, and ALL his team, then this book may interest you, but if you're in it for the dark knight and the dark knight alone, just forget about it and pick up a different graphic novel. Perhaps, Hush or something by McFarlane.Good Luck in whatever you find."
4,Criminal war begins,"As a meeting of all the most powerful crime bosses takes place, a powder keg explodes that devolves into a gang war. Batman and all his allies are cast into a constant defensive position, putting out fires all over Gotham. What can end this nightmarish gang war in which innocent people are being killed?What is worse, it becomes clear that a third party is pulling strings and manipulating this worst of situations to gain an upper hand. However, it is clear that the chaos and confusion caused by this war will not be easy to undo.War Games contains some great art. In addition, this is another great way to implement the full Batman gallery of rogues, an undertaking that is admirable. Batman's list of strange and unique enemies is indeed a long one, and War Games makes a good run at pitting them against one another. War Games is a solid Batman graphic novel series."
2,Not a strong story,"This was one of the few Batman stories that I couldn't follow all the way through. It was uninteresting, and just as so many authors are doing with Batman lately, it does not portray him as the detective, therefore there were no foreseeable plot twists or intrigues to make me want to read more. If you want a solid Batman story, pick up Hush, or Bruce Wayne: Murderer."
2,More to be desired,"Tried this unit out and its heading staight back to Best Buy. It certainly does pick up local HDTV signals without its power booster, and picture only improves slightly with the booster plugged in. Reception was never completely clear for six local channels, and my non-Hi Def signal from my Dish was vastly better than the over-the-air signals using this antenna. It got two stars because it's slightly better than no antenna at all."
1,jensen tv-931 is a poor product,This antenna gets poor reception. It does not matter where you place it. Since the connection cable is attched inside the unit it can not be up graded to a better cable. many channels were pixilated and some had no reception at all. This antenna needs more amplification.
3,Worthy reading,"Nice story of the experience of premature birth and motherhood. My heart goes out to anyone who has had to face such trying circumstances, and I'm very glad the story has a happy ending.I did get sidetracked by Minton's apparant ""blame"" of twins to her RE, however. On one level I kept thinking how could she not have thought thru this process, or done her homework or research as an educated health care consumer, instead of blaming everybody else after the fact?Oh -- and as someone else mentioned, there are far too many irrelevant details or tangents. Minton is really, really proud of going to Groton. I lost count of how many times that fact was mentioned even in places seemingly irrelevant."
2,Too much of an Infomercial,"Although this book contains good information, it is tinted by the fact that one of the authors, Robert Portman, sells sports nutrition products. As a result, the impression is that the goal of this book is to prove that Mr. Portman's products are the best. Maybe they are but then, it would be more credible if the book was written by independent researchers."
1,Not as strong as advertised,My planter's size and weight were both well within the parameters advertised for the holder but it was not strong enough to keep it from bending and tipping the planter waaaay over. Would not recommend at all.
1,Worst toaster I have ever owned,"From the day I bought it, the lever would not stay down. It just didn't work, period. I had to physically hold it down to get a piece of toast. I called Oster and they sent me a second one for no charge. They told me to cut off the cord of the first one and put it in the trash. The replacement arrived quickly (that is the only good thing I will say about Oster) but it ended up not working either. It worked for a couple months but then the same thing... the lever no longer stayed down. Oster has a serious problem with design and/or quality control. Sadly for them, I am not going to bother giving them another chance. I now have an excellent KitchenAid toaster, and the Oster is destined to be used for target practice next time I go out to the country. It'll make a fine if expensive target... it sure is a cheap toaster."
3,The last one of these I had lasted 10 years,"I was hoping to get another one, but after reading the reviews it seems this isn't the same toaster I bought form them 10 years ago. It's to bad :("
2,Not good,I bought this toaster a few months ago and now when it pops up the toast the light stays on but luckily the burner part is not on. It seems that one of the pop up parts doesn't want to slide up and down evenly. I guess you buy cheap stuff this is what you get. I should have kept my old toaster which was missing the little plastic handle.
1,Avoid,"This toaster failed within a year, and of course we weren't able to locate the receipt. It's surprising that its warranty was even valid for one year--what a leap of faith on the manufacturer's part! To start with, it never toasted evenly (as other Amazon reviewers have noted). The first part of the toaster actually to fail was the lever for lowering the toast. After three months it began to lose its ability to lock down. At more or less the same time, the aluminum cradles that hold the toast up inside the toaster started to fall apart. Once the lever failed completely, the toaster ceased to be a toaster. The blue lights still look nice, though. Buy this toaster if you want a very expensive night light. Otherwise, avoid it."
3,It does it job well enough but the slots are too short.,"It's an inexpensive toaster and does its job pretty well.It toasts consistantly and doesn't have a problem with any bread type.I haven't had a chance to use the defrost or bagel setting so I'm not sure if how much value these add.Some negatives:1. Most importantly, the slots while wide are very short. Your average rye bread slice slice doesn't fit and even some of the fancier commercial products like Orro/Arnold barely fit. This in itself makes me sad that I purchased this toaster.2. the Blue 'neon' lighting in the buttons never turns off. This might be a way to help you know if you toaster is plugged in but it ends up being annoying."
2,Flimsy make.,"Bought this toaster a year ago and have had problems with it since the very beginning. When making toast, it would feel like the lever wasn't catching and so wouldn't work. Today, it finally gave out. I won't buy another one. Also, a bright blue light on the front face of the toaster is annoying, especially at night. And was bright enough to shine right into my bedroom. I usually left it unplugged."
1,Oster 6331 toaster,We bought this about 6 months ago and it stopped working around a week ago. The pop-up mechanism is very flimsy. Sometimes it brought the toast up when the cycle was complete and sometimes it didn't. We'll be looking for a different brand next time. Very disappointing.
1,"40-pages of screenshots and sparse, poorly written text.","This is not a ""book,"" it's just a thin pamphlet. Its text is sparse and poorly written. I would be embarassed to have authored and released this title, if only for its abundant mechanical errors. Don't waste your money--add your $7.50 to the purchase of any of the multitude of legitimate Access texts available. If you only have $7.50 to spend on Access tutorial literature, you'll be far better off by just beginning to read the help files that accompany Access."
3,"If you like Jong, you'll like this book","This book of essays does hold your attention. You may not like her point of view, but you'll have to give her credit for being honest about it. She covers it all in bits and pieces, the only clue to what they all have in commom is the title. Having sex is very important to her, and I found this theme tiring after a while. She does present herself as what I'd call a typical New Yorker. She seeks to impress the reader with her life, and it comes off sometimes as bragging. I'm a fan of Henry Miller so I enjoyed her first hand impression of him - they must have been soulmates, seeking sexual experiences where ever they could find them. I can see why given her point of view she feared fifty as it gets harder to attract strangers - so I may read more of her yet. If you're a writer you'll probably be interested in her struggles as an author and mother."
1,Politically Correct Feminist Ramblings,"It is very hard to follow Jung's logic. Her book jumps around like a bunge cord, never staying long enough to explain her unsupportable conclusions. Most distressing is her apologetic acceptance of the behavior of the President. In fairness, there are some amusing parts."
5,A gem of a book,"A tour de force. Corrigan manages to provide literary, historical, mythological themes and contexts that illuminate current practice and belief.I found the details of this book enlarged my understanding of why and how these religions have many common strains and where they depart from one another.It also explains how the traditions of each,along with the practice,ethics and politics keep each vital enough in different countries and changing times to keep them going. A very weighty and multidimensional subject written with much grace. It's not only excellent as a reference book, it also holds up as a fascinating read."
3,"Jews, Christians, Muslims","While this book provides a very informative review of each of these religions, and the students in my class benefited a great deal from the material presented, I found the writing style to be exceedingly dry and difficult to read in most chapters. I was also somewhat dismayed at the way a great deal of the material on the Christian and Jewish faiths were presented. I think that if the authors were going to present their own perspective, they are entitled to do so. However, they should point out that it is their own perspective. I think some of the material was so slanted that it could be argued that the information is incorrect."
1,Some books are not hight quality when they say they are.,Most of the books I have purchased from Amazon are of high quality but one of them in particular was rated high and said it was in great condition and it is terrible. The book is missing it's cover and losing pages when I open it. I is of terrible quality and I was very disappointed about being tricked and thinking I was buying a good book when it's of very poor quality.
5,"A Teaching Guide to Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry (Discovering Literature)","Excellent resource. I have many resource booklets, but this one is my favorite. It has many activities that follow my curriculum guidelines and creative ideas for exteding the lessons."
4,"Parker, can we be friends?","You're not going to like Parker Grey.You're going to love her! You're going to wish she was your sister, your roommate or your wacky upstairs neighbor. You're going to want to invite her over for egg sandwiches and re-runs of ER. And you're going to wish you were half as talented as her creator.Buckley's heroine is irreverent and ridiculous and completely cracked-out on her own neurosis. In other words, she's fabulous.The Parker Grey Show is ""miss your bus stop"" good. Read it."
4,this just rocks,"All I have to say is that Parker Grey may have single-handedly saved the chick lit genre from total ruin. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm tired of reading about main characters obsessed with designer clothes and shoes. I like that the main character is working class and that she has an obsessive love of TV, and that the author has managed to craft a character with so many faults that actually make her endearing. In the wrong hands, it would have just gone all wrong, but I really look forward to Kristen Buckley's future work. I hope she has another novel in the works. I only took one star off because I wish the book could have gone a little longer."
2,Lacks purpose,"So many poinless scenes thrown into one movie leave the viewer asking, what difference does it make if he plays basketball or just aimlessly wanders the streets? And where is the kung fu? Boring and disappointing."
1,waste of time,"Okay, this movie was painful. there were several good jokes but the music was unbearably cheesy and out of place, the character development was pathetic, and the even the action was just weird and uninteresting. it was horrible. if you have any interest in basketball this movie will let you down. they demolish everything interesting about the game; in this movie players can switch teams whenever they want, people can bribe the refs to goaltend game winning shots, knock the power out if things aren't going their way and even pull a nancy carrigan with a baseball bat. the sob story about the orphans lost parents made me wonder what the writers could possibly be thinking. I thought the silliness was funny at first but it was way over the top and got old very fast."
2,Entertaining - like a train wreck,"The only resemblance to Shaolin Soccer is some of the cast. I still think the show should be called Kung Fu Drunk, because you'd have to be to follow this show.Jay Chou plays an innocent orphan, Jie, who is manipulated by a homeless loser. He develops considerable skill at basketball, while The Loser manipulates him and the press for his own enrichment.Too many scenes show The Loser making ridiculous faces directly into the camera, which destroys any immersion you may have been experiencing during the brief well-paced parts.Where Shaolin Soccer has character development that draws you in, Kung Fu Drunk has fuzzy flashbacks to earlier in the film to remind you what you were trying to forget.There's a bunch of scenes, and then all of a sudden 4 kung fu masters have a huge fight with everyone on the opposing team except for the 5 main players who still have to face off with the heroic underdogs and lose for the finale.What the heck?"
1,Disappointing,"I think this is pretty light in entertainment value. [Much better is Fishing Luck, of similar vintage.] The problem with Kung Fu Dunk is that there really isn't any intelligible story, and ridiculous liberties are taken with the rules and game of basketball. I'd skip it."
5,Three Great Lessons,"Bridget Anderson,Carmen Green,and Margie Walker each wrote a fantastic story about Kwanzaa and love. Each lesson on the principles of Kwanzaa help the people to learn a new way to share, and a new way to show love. For those of us who are trying to decide if we want to start celebrating Kwanzaa these stories are a must."
4,Looking up really rocks!,I thought it was great stuff...never heard the M-word. That dude in Pomona must have been listening to something else.
3,Hmm...,"I love Autopilot Off (p.k.a. Cooter), and this cd has its good and bad parts. The bad thing about this cd is the similarity of the songs - most of them have nearly same drumbeat and guitar riffs. My favorite songs are the ones that don't sound like the rest: Full House, Looking Up, Underrated, and Sleep Tight. I (highly) recommend Autopilot Off's EP instead of this, but if you like punk, you might like this.And APO is not a Christian band...*sigh*"
1,"Boring, derivative punk band","This group wishes it could be The Offspring. Unfortunately this group is no Offspring. This is just another highly derivative, unoriginal punk group that sounds like the crap the other groups threw away."
3,The band is ok,"This band has some good tunes, turned on to them from the Atticus compilation under the name Autopilot Off. This CD however has 12 songs that sound very similar to one another, just by skimming through the tracks, the clips of all 12 tracks sound almost like they just duplicated themselves. Decent effort."
2,Very poor construction,"I purchased one of these units along with two TF-S10 speakers from the same manufacturer. Less than 3 months after installing the product the paint is already chipping off on the TFS-50. It has only rained one time and there are no sprinklers anywhere near the unit, so the paint is basically falling off without any provocation. When I inspected the unit after noticing the paint chips I tipped it slightly and a large amount of water came pouring out. Apparently it is not only not sealed against water intrusion but it also allows it to collect inside. Given the small amount of rain we get here it is surprising that any was able to collect at all. I attempted to return the unit for repair or replacement but the manufacturer insisted that I pay for the packaging and shipping. Given the size and weight of this object it is not worth my time to do this. I recommend avoiding this manufacturer entirely."
5,Hard Hitting And Raw,"Oh yes this is what I miss about not being in the UK at the moment, acting that knocks the socks off anything others try to attempt to do. The stories are written with real events and people in mind, no fairy story book here, this is life as it is,I know I lead it each week,FROM THE BAR TO THE BED,FROM HATE TO LOVE,may there be many more of these outstanding works of art.Director David Blair brings to the screen images that would seem to be impossible to capture from Jimmy McGoven's pen.A masterpiece sums up the First Season, with a haunting theme music that captures the mood to perfection. 5 Stars Plus."
2,Just o.k.,"Only one of the 3 DVD's is worth having in this bunch.However,on that one(interviews with band members and Dave Davies,the ultra-heavy English accents of the speakers is difficult to understand at times.The other 2 DVD's duplicate the performances and the commentary of the other people on the discs is very much meaningless.Rating their hits and saying what millions of people have said millions of times doesn't seem very entertaining.I was not impressed with this DVD pack."
1,A complete waste of money....,"If you are wanting to read a sales commercial during each chapter written, then buy this book. By the time I realized what each chapter was doing (about half way through), I merely began to gleem over the remaining chapters just to verify all was indeed a sales pitch of Agora Finacial services prior to throwing the book in the trash. Now I have never thrown a book in the trash, much less ever given an online review, however the book does not explain any ""how to's"", other than buying into Agora's services to obtain the 'how to' intelligence - I feel it's unethical to have to 'pay' for an infomercial especially without that issue being disclosed."
1,Extended Infomercial,"The book has two interesting chapters covering the topics of demographic trends which will impact economic and geopolitical events. These chapters are similar in nature to Harry Dent's discussion in his book The Next Great Bubble Boom. In this regard, I would recommend reading Dent's book instead.The chapters describing the ""hot trading secrets"" are very qualitative in nature. Some of the ""hot"" secrets are obvious; others are less so. However, the book does not provide sufficient information for the reader to utilize the information in their trading activities.Overall, this book is, in my opinion, an extended infomercial for the (very expensive) newsletters offered by the author."
1,disappointed,"In a nutshell, he is just promoting his stock advisory services. Enough information is given to get you excited, But not enough to help most, unless you subscribe to his service."
1,"long on vague examples and advertising, short on content-a ripoff!!!","I bought it, I read it. It was long on vague examples and advertising, short on content-a ripoff!!! I am really really disappointed in this book. Save your money for elsewhere!"
1,Don't go near anything published by Agora!!!!,"I once subscribed to a newsletter from Agora publishing. It cost me thousands of dollars. I couldn't have done that poorly if I consciously tried. Obviously, this book has no relation to the newsletter except for the fact that it came from the same publisher. I send this as a warning -- buyer beware..."
1,One Huge Infomercial,This is the first time I ever paid for a Infomercial. That what this book is. In essence virtually every trading concept presented requires you to join their website to be able to actually trade that concept.
3,ay no!,"even with carmen miranda & the nicholas brothers numbers, the repetition over & over of the same theme song over & over by the different singers casted & the really boring plot, makes this a movie only worth for the musical numbers & you can cut the rest & throw it to the garbage"
4,Plenty of (slightly farfetched) Fun,"I've seen four of Betty Grable's films so far, and it's fun to see her in her first major role. There's so much to like here--Charlotte Greenwood, the Nicholas brothers, all the rousing music. This film goes down like a good chocolate ice cream.That having been said, the film does require a suspension of credibility. In particular, the relationship between Betty Grable's and Don Ameche's characters is a leetle too sudden...how far into the movie do these people start making sheep's eyes at each other? It also would have been nice to see more of Carmen Miranda, but what's there is memorable. It's easy to see why America took to her.As of now, ""Pin-up Girl"" and ""Moon Over Miami"" are my favorite Betty Grable films, but I have a feeling ""Down Argentine Way"" will wear well."
4,Old Calsic,This item was purchaded as a gist to my mother. She realy love to have this picture in her collection and remenber her old times.
5,Buena calidad,Lo necesitaba para preparar pan. Muy fresca y bien empacada. La recomiendo para las recetas que lo utilicen. Uselo sin dudarlo
4,THE OLD GOOD TIMES,"THIS AN EXCELLENT ALBUM. I USE TO LISTEN TO IT WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN HAITI. MOST OF THE MUSICS ON THIS ALBUM REFLECT THE HAITIAN CULTURE. THE LEGEND ""BOUKI AND MALICE"" IS MY PREFERD.KINDEST REGARDS,"
4,Technical Note: Aspect Ratio 2.35:1,"The aspect ratio of 2.35:1 represents ""CinemaScope"" (a popular cinema widescreen format, used up until 1967). Trandlated into modern 16:9 flatscreen TV's that correspond with the current international standard format of HDTV or 1.77:1 or 1.78:1 (16:9)) means that this film will render on your TV in full width but not full height of your screen. Some will ""generally"" prefer to view films (whatever their content) in their native formats, versus a commercial crop like the ""old school"" 4:3 (1.33:1) TV standard ratio. If you have an old 4:3 TV dinosaur, you'll have an even smaller ""picture""."
5,My review on amazon,"My review of amazon,the ones I didn't rate I didn't see yet or receive in the mail .I like any picture dean martin is in,the tape and the disc I bought allplayed good on my machine.and it seems all the products I bought so far from amazon lived up to their standards of doing what they say what they will do for their customers.Edward Costello"
4,Day Book of Critical Reading and Writing,This is an excellent resource for teachers. Day Book gives students very good examples of how to write responses to passages read in the book. Day Book has interesting topics to read that will interest students.
2,My Opinion...,"The reason I gave this book two stars, is because we use this book in our class all of the time. Most of the stories and poems in here are hard to understand and complicated.I know that you are supposed to use your mind, and there is no right or wrong answer, but you can not use your mind if you dont know what is going on. I keep getting zero's on my daybook assignments, because all I can put in the margins or the pages to write what you think, is that I can't write anything because it was hard to understand, so I get zero's for not understanding, and that to me isnt fair! So, I think that if to this book you tell your opinion, I think that if your opinion is that you didnt understand it, than that should still be counted as ""no right or wrong answer"".But besides that, it is a good idea."
4,"Good for a phone, but not much else...","I got this phone a few months ago and am very pleased with it's performance. Overall it is a simple slick phone with a strong battery life. My first full charge lasted for over 10 days. It is good for making calls, and it takes pretty clear pictures for a phone, but the videos don't come out to great. When you get into the music mp3 features and other thigns, it just isn't to great for that. The sound quality isn't very good, and I wouldn't buy this phone if thats what your looking for.. Another annoying feature is that the speaker phone only works when the phone is open, and if you close it, the call iis ended. Other than that, if your looking for a phone jsut to be a phone, I would definatly recomend this one."
3,KOSS DVD PLAYERS,"DON'T BUY IT! I bought a KOSS DVD player and it broke in 6 months. I was told I was out of luck because the warranty is only 90 days. They do not do repairs. My only option is to buy a new one and wasn't even offered a discounted price for it. I have seen several complaints like mine about KOSS on the web. They make JUNK and they make it to last just to get past the warranty period and then it breaks. Oh, by the way I loved it until it broke."
2,Progressive scan,The progressive scan is software configured ( through the remote) and only works through the component video output section of the player. It will not run through the s-video output. If you wish to use it as a regular player through the s-video then it's ok but you may wish to pay the extra bucks for one that outputs to a variety of outputs.
1,Not one of her best.,My first Lavyrle Spencer book was Then Came Heaven and I thought it was great. I read a few more of her books and I have to say this is the worst I have read. The characters were boring. There was no plot. It was written on the level of a high school student. I was so disappointed in this book. It took me weeks to finish because it would not hold my interest. I would not recommmed this one.
1,Is Spencer for Real?,"I choose books-on-tape to travel with that I might not ordinarily buy and read such as mysteries or authors I've never read before or I'm uncertain about. Spencer was one such author. I can't understand how such poorly written garbage can gather the good reviews this book has generated. It makes one question the system. Very poor plot, characters, dialogue, etc. Also, Spencer should pay someone to do her reading for her. Her delivery only made it worse."
1,This book is actually a zero!,"The author's talent went right out the window with this one! It was undoubtedly the most boring book I've ever read. The characters weren't true to form, especially the teens. And the step by step dialogue of every move these people made was very annoying; ('he approached the door, he opened the door, he stepped inside, he closed the door, he locked the door, he walked away from the door.)If you're new to this author, skip this one. It isn't a fair judgment of her usual work."
2,"Emotionally Honest, but Lacking","Simplistic and often poorly written, Home Song ranks in the lowest echelon of Spencer's works. Featuring a heroine whose reason for holding a grudge is shaky at best; a trio of teenagers straight out of Dawson's Creek; and a hero who keeps losing his level-headed approach to life whenever the script demands it, there's not a lot in this book about which to rave.The high point would be the achingly realistic way Spencer portrays Tom's emotions when he learns of the son he never knew he had.All in all, Home Song will fill time on a flight or bus ride, but if you're looking for something of substance, look elsewhere."
3,Audiotape abridgement doesn't do it justice,"I listened to the audiotape version of Home Song and was disappointed in the way it was abridged. I understand that the book had to be trimmed to keep the running time at 3 hours but, as a result, Home Song lost a lot of its melody. Lavyrle Spencer is an excellent writer, and it is grossly unfair that her novel was chopped up to become a trite and highly predictable audiotape"
5,one of her best books ever!,i loved this book! a story of a drama that perhaps could happen in every family.i couldn`t put it down.
4,Expect this one to be a little different....,"I have read all of Lavyrle Spencer's books and I have to admit that this one is not my favorite. But there is something about this book that is different from the rest. This book does not focus on a new romance, or rekindling an old one, like the rest of Spencer's books. This is about a happy, well-adjusted family who gets hit by a catalyst and has to deal with the consequences of a mistake the father made 18 years ago.I liked the all of the characters in this but I did get really tired of the way Claire stayed angry at Tom, not because of what he did, but because she refused to believe that he wasn't fooling around in the present. That just got old after awhile. I really liked the way the kids reconciled at the end, though.All in all, I did really enjoy this book and would recommend it as a good, light read, just don't expect a romance novel."
4,Tidal Wave Effect of Change,"This was a pretty good Spencer novel. Not my all-time favorite (that was probably Twice Loved or Then Came Heaven), but this is an older work of hers and it can show in places. Overall I was pretty impressed at the thoroughness that went into the book, characters and situations.Finding out about an illegitament son 18 years later has a tidal wave effect on the Gardner family- comprised of Tom, Clair, and their two children. You can't help but read on in awe, wondering how this is going to play out, how each of the characters will react etc. It was a pretty fast read for me because I was so involved wondering how this was going to turn out. Happily, I enjoyed the ending which did not feel fake or forced.I'd recommend Lavyrle Spencer books to a romance lover, family drama reader. Her books are really a bit of both and done with much more finess than most writers in this genre!"
2,Disappointed,"Normally I like J. California Cooper's work. But Wake of the Wind was a real disappointment. Ms. Cooper preached throughout the entire book which lacked any real character development. It was just long, repetitive and sappy. I'd like to think that my ancestors (slaves) were about more than farming, cooking, marrying, and running from the white man. I also find it hard to believe that EVERYBODY was just so insightful and ""right"" about everything all the time (even the children). I would have liked to have seen a more realistic portrait of thier lives. One in which we see that they really were human and had triumphs and failures of their own volition."
2,"Disappointing - ""Good Times"" in a Book","I've read all of Cooper's books and found this one to be very trite and boring. The author spent too much time explaining the tragedy of slavery. The best way to draw readers is by being ambiguous. She should let the reader define the horrible picture of slavery. Moreover, the characters weren't very authentic to me. Who was Lifee anyway, Florence Nightingale? I can't imagine a family taking in that many strangers. And, were things that easy for them? Also, I believe its time for Cooper to expand her literary work. She's written enough novels and short stories on slavery. Nevertheless, ""Homemade love"" and ""Family"" were much better!"
5,Ne plus ultra is the only way to describe California Cooper,"J. California Cooper will be looked upon as the epitome of intellectual, no holds barred, Author/Storyteller for many, many years to come. I started reading ""The Wake Of The Wind"" while I was in the hospital, and like all her other books, it becomes glued to your hands and will not fall away until you have read the last word. When reading this book, you will be angry, sad, sometimes happy and most of all, you will be proud to be an African American. The names Lifee and Mor will be etched in your minds forever. I don't think Ms. Cooper is capable of writing anything other than 5 Star books. Keep'em comin Ms. Cooper and I'll Keep read'em"
5,"Six stars!Once again, Ms. Cooper outdoes herself.","When you love Ms. Cooper like I love Ms. Cooper it is scary when she comes out with something new, because you wonder can she top this!. Well baby, she did! I was so moved by the characters, so caught up in the lives of everyone, that I couldn't put the book down. I didn't want it to end. I am still in mourning over completing this book. This was the best of the best. Life is so good!"
4,REAL BLACK POWER,"My rating is probably a 4.5. THE WAKE OF THE WIND is powerful, but sad and sometimes depressing. It's an excellent and probably truth-based fiction of Southern times for Blacks during and after slavery.Ms Cooper puts together a chronological saga of one Black couple as they leave slavery and strike out toward freedom. It's about the deep love and acceptance they share for each other. It's about the ragtag group of misfits that they pick up along the way and happily call ""family."" And it's about the obstacles they face together, culminating in seeing their dreams realized.More than anything, this book stressed the importance of family, friends, education and hardwork."
5,I can't say enough,"When I sarted this book I was like another slave story but, as I got more into it, I couldn't put it down. I read it everywhere, at work, home, on the train. I laughed, cried and got mad. Now you know when a book can make you do that, that's a book!!!!! I can't say enough. I loved it. To learn what our people had to go through just because of the color of skin. But we're here strong, proud and still black.."
5,This book is a must read!,"I love to read this type of novel. I've read most of Ms. Cooper's books but this one in particular was the better of the best of her novels. I winced, got angry, cried, etc. My own parents are a true inspiration to me but this book only validates my belief that I am truly an African-American treasure."
4,RELAXING,GREETINGS I HAD NEVER LISTENED TO ANY OF DEUTER'S MUSIC UNTIL 3 YEARS AGO I LIKE THIS CD FOR A TOTAL RELAXING AND UNWIDING EVENING YOU OWE THIS TO YOURSELF TO TRY THE SAMPLES AVAILIABLE TO YOU ON AMAZON OR YOUTUBE THIS IS HOW I BUY NEW MUSIC AS WELL YOU CAN VISIT BARNES AND NOBLE AND SAMPLE MUSIC PROVIDED THAT PARTICULAR STORE HAS MUSIC IN IT HOPE YOU ALL ENJOY
5,The best,"Over the past 10 years this has been one of my all time favorite CDs to play when I help my clients with deep relaxation. As a childbirth educator, I have literally countless selections of relaxation music. Over and over and over, my clients and I like this one the best. I did not realize the Deuter had other CDs...so today, I am purchasing a selection of his other offerings. I feel like I owe him...because his work has helped me to do my work. God bless his talents!"
2,annoyingly repetitive,"I love to play music to go to sleep and saw this CD has been recommended for that purpose. Droning/chanting, ocean waves, etc. that type of music helps me go to sleep. Surprisingly I found CD very disappointing for that purpose. It is annoyingly repetitive, to the point where I have to shut it off! I may try it for yoga practice but otherwise its out of here."
5,Great Relay,"Tried to buy one at Advanced Auto Parts and Napa Auto Parts, both of them had the relay for $12-14, withOUT the socket and 5 wires. For $8, this is a sweet deal. Description says it's for lights but really this is useful for any 5 pin relay that needs the following pins (85, 86, 87, 87a, and 30). I personally used it for installing a Remote Start as I had two starters that needed to be relayed. Also, the reviews about not having NC pin is not true. All 5 pins and 5 wires were there in both of my units."
1,Waste of Money!,"I purchased this item based on a recommendation when purchasing BullDog Remote start and this item was not needed, waste of money!"
1,Not as advertised... not a 5-terminal relay,I was looking for a 5-terminal relay because I need the 87a terminal to switch something off versus switching it on. This is listed with a 5-wire harness and I foolishly thought it was a 5-terminal relay and it was not. I am sending it back.
1,JUNK,"I always test new products to make sure they are functioning correctly before using them in a complex circuit and out of the two I ordered only one worked correctly, The one that didn't work had continuity bleed through the normally open terminal. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,not hapy,"There is no NC contact in this relay. It only has a NO contact. The included plug does have five wires as stated, its just that one of them goes to nothing.Seller could have written a better description."
1,I should have believed the other reviews!,These relays are NOT 5 pin relays. The connector is 5 wire but the relay attached to it is only 4 pin. Now I know why others are having issues connecting these up.It's probably a waste to return these items. This vendor is getting away with false advertising and probably not getting many return due to the low cost. They have complaints on other sites as well.
1,Lied about the brand name,Sherco presents this item as a Bulldog brand product when in fact it is now.
3,they relays were all different looking but they worked,The relays all looked different but worked like they were supposed too. If you like uniformity and take pride with your work and want profesional looking results from your project look else where.
2,low profile?,"Don't be misled, this is NOT a low profile cap! I have a standard cap just like it so was excited to find a low profile cap in the same design. Pictures can be misleading but if you look closely you can see that the had is standard not low profile. Robert is disapointed!"
2,Picky,"Pros: Instrument-level input to a PCCons: Bundled software is worthless. Input is extremely quiet - almost to the point of uselessness.Other: I suggest inputting this to FL Studio or some other ASIO-enabled studio software. To get anythign useful from it, I had to patch it in to FL Studio and plug a compressor AND a maximizer into the signal - but at that point there is really no dynamic range, and the only difference between a light pick and a good strong one is that the strong one clips (sounds like really cheap overdrive).More Other: Not sure if this is ASIO or just FL Studio that was acting up, but it was only possible to output to a file or to speakers through the jamlab, rendering my nice expensive soundcard idle."
1,Don't buy this,"Bought this for a trip to Italy. Tried to translate words seen in stores, on menus, train station signs etc. This thing was horrible. It does not work for Italian and I suspect it would be equally bad for all languages. Very disappointed."
2,Not on the same level as some of Patterson's other books.,"Season of the Machete was a bit disappointing. It might be a fine light read, but don't expect anything on the level with Jack and Jill, Kiss the Girls, or Along Came a Spider"
1,"all surface, no substance","This book reads as if it were written in one marathon sprint, the plot racing from one bloody event to the next, with barely a pause for character development or background detail. What could have been an intriguing novel of mercenary killers and political upheaval is instead a throwaway pulp crime novel."
1,No review,Do not wish to review the book at this time.I do not wish to write a review or have my name used.
3,Pretty Good,Bought the book even though the reviews were not favorable. I wouldn't say it was my favorite Patterson book but I still enjoyed it.
2,Scarry reading,"The Machete use was not good for my sleep/dreams. Love the writing but was very hard for me, knives & machetes are terrifying!"
2,Surprisingly lame,"This is one of Patterson's weakest books by far. As always I was looking forward to decent writing and a semi-believable plot. Alas, it was not to be."
1,Season of the Machete,"I am a James Patterson fan, however, I had a very hard time reading this book. Worst James Patterson book I have ever read. No real story line. Poorly written. I couldn't even give this book one star, a rating was required to submit."
1,Should have stayed in the trunk,"I suspect Patterson wrote this novel before his first published novel, which won an Edgar, and got it published thanks to the success of The Thomas Berryman Number.He should have either kept it buried deep in his drawer, or taken the time to re-write, if only for coherence.The initial murders are shocking and intriguing. Unfortunately, the entire plot of a cabal to overthrow the government of a fictional Caribbean island makes no sense.Neither does the counter-plotting by the husband-wife assassin duo they hire.Neither does the plot of the wife to kill her husband and then write a bestseller about it all.An ex-Green Beret appears and threatens to be a real hero for maybe 3 paragraphs, then turns out to be a worthless wuss.Read only if you're determined to read every novel Patterson has ever published."
5,Season of the Machete,Received quickly. In perfect condition. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Thank you so much!! Cost was very reasonable.
1,Waste of time,"Found myself not caring what happened to any of the characters. What a travesty of writing! Patterson, himself, recommended NOT reading this book. He should buy up any remaining copies and burn them."
1,"A Terrible, Terrible Book","SEASON OF THE MACHETE is James Patterson's second novel, originally written in the mid 1970s. This book was re-issued in the 1990s to capitalize on the success of the Alex Cross series. Although I'm a fan of Patterson's later work, I found this particular novel to be remarkably bad.There are so many things wrong with this novel it's hard to list them all. The characterization in SEASON OF THE MACHETE is thin to non-existent. The premise of the novel is absurd, and the rambling, incoherent plotline made for a confusing read. Ever read a book and have no idea what's going on most of the time? Or much less care? This is that kind of novel.In short, SEASON OF MACHETE is one the most painful reading experiences I've had in a long time. Unless you're a Patterson completist, my advice is to avoid this novel at all costs."
1,Don't bother,"If this would have been the first James Patterson book I ever read, it would have been the last (and that would have been a shame!). Too gory (without any real purpose), too many characters (who are very one-dimensional) and too much stuff going. That being said, I did quit reading this book about 1/3 of the way through (which I hardly ever do). Maybe I missed out on the good stuff in the last part of the book, but I really doubt it!"
2,"I, too, listened to Season of the Machete","I bought this book to listen to on a long driving trip. Expecting the usual entertaining quality of Mr. Patterson's work, I was disappointed. The story and characters were not well developed, but I continued to listen. As the end I was puzzled by this book and finally thought to look at the copyright date - 1977! I've concluded it was written early in Mr. Patterson's career and that's the explanation I choose to accept for my disappointment! This will not prevent my buying his more recent books."
3,"Not an Alex Cross, but fun reading...","This was by no means an Alex Cross novel, but the book was quick and light to read. I found it amusing, but maybe that was due to the outlandish and bizarre methods of the murders...."
3,Season of the Machete by James Patterson,"This is probably the only Patterson book that really freaked me out. Quite a bit of gory material, but still a book you had a hard time putting down."
1,"Not typical Patterson stuff, his worse book yet.","I agree with the other reviews, Mr Patterson just threw this one together, don't waste your time reading this one his others are great but this one is lacking in everything."
1,This was a big disappointment,"Appreciating the work of this author very much, I was extremely disappointed with this book. It was full of unsubstantiated violence and it was an uncomfortable read with a lousy ending"
2,Confusing,Patterson writes great stuff that keeps you on the edge of your seat. This one seems to cheat. The dates set up a mystery that is not only not resolved but becomes contradictory........Jim.... HELP.... what is going on in this book
1,must have been one he wrote a long time ago,this was not a good book. i am a huge fan of his writing but this was not one of his best or even close. he must have written it a long time ago and couldn't get it published because it sucked and now that he is popular they will publish anything with his name on it.
2,NOT WORTH THE TIME OR EFFORT TO READ...,"This book was first published in 1977. So, it is one of the earlier works by the author, and it shows. Sloppy editing, a rambling plot that lacks cohesion, and one dimensional characters are some of the ills that plague this book.Still, the book has its moments with its many plot twists and turns. Unfortunately, these moments are not enough to make this story of two contract killers anything other than mediocre.Some dedicated fans of the author may derive a modicum enjoyment from this uneven, earlier work. A few may simply want to read it to see how much the author has improved since this early effort. My recommendation is that with so many good books to read on the market, don't bother."
1,Would rate it a zero star if that was an option,"I am an avid James Patterson fan and have embarqued on the mission to read every single one of his books. I am also someone who hates to start a book and not finish it. I wish I had read the reviews of this book before I bought it. I probably would have done so anyway to get my own opinion. However I wouldn't have forced myself to get as far as I did solely on the premise that I wasn't giving the book a chance.I couldn't finish it. With most of my James Patterson reads I spend at the most 3-4 consecutive days from beginning to end. Heading into my second week at attempting to finish this incomprehensible disaster of a book, I finally gave up and skipped to the end.I'm glad that James Patterson got much better with maturity because this earlier writing was painful at best."
2,Read on the beach-of all places,"Read this in one day while sitting on the beach! What a confusing ending-I had to read the last few pages twice since the characters were confusing-who were the ""good""/""bad"" guys? Patterson has come a long way as a writer since this book was originally published in 1977."
3,"Good, but not his best","I have always enjoyed James Patterson. This book was good, but a little more violent and graphic than I like. Still a good read. At the time I bought this book, I also purchased Leith MacArthur's ""Losing Amber Lee"". That was an excellent book with a different twist. Worth reading."
2,Season of the Machete,"I am a huge Patterson fan and have read over 20 of his books. I have to say this one was the toughest one to get into. It is confusing in the beginning and not one of his normal ""page turners"". Stick with it for the first 50+ pages and it gets better. All in all, not one of his better stories."
1,Terrible!!,"This book is just so disjointed and poorly written, it is very difficult to follow what's going on, let alone be interested in it at all. I bailed after just 25 pages. The only cool aspect of this book is that it has a character with my name, but once he is killed off by page 25, that's when I figured it was a sign that would be a good place to stop reading.Readers familiar with his post Along the Spider novels won't even believe this is written by the same James Patterson. It's obvious that this book was only re-released to steal money from those who started reading Patterson for the Cross series, and I feel like a sucker for buying this book.In musical terms, I analogize this with Ministry's With Sympathy."
1,Disappointing Patterson,"James Patterson's books are usually a page turner. The suspense holds the reader until the last page. However, I find this statment to be true for the Alex Cross novels because this book not only did not take hold of my attention, but I actually stopped reading half way through. I'm not sure if the book gets better, but it is not the usual Patterson which is interesting from chapter 1. Simply put, this book was a bore and a disappointment. Patterson does have some other great books out there, especially those with Alex Cross."
4,SEASON OF THE MACHETE,THE BOOK WAS A TYPICAL PATTERSON THRILLER. KEEPS YOU INTERESTED AND YOUR HEART POUNDING. AFTER A FEW OF HIS BOOKS YOU START LOOKING FOR THE ANTI-TYPICAL VILLIAN IN THE FIRST CHAPTER.
2,What was that about?,"Wow. Did this make any sense to anyone? Was it just me or did the dates used in the book just not match up? It starts out in 1980 with characters that get killed off during the book in 1979? Please explain this to me if there is an explanation. Also, what was the motivation behind hiring these people to carry out all these murders anyway? That was never clear or explained. And lastly, what was up with the ending? Maybe I am slow, but it made no sense to me at all!"
2,Poorly written and constructed,"Reasonable story idea but very poorly put together. Got some free used Patterson books from a friend, ""The Thomas Berryman Number"" was a similar type book about crime, but much better than ""Season of the Machete"".Guess Patterson was still learning with this book."
1,Season of Disappointment,"This was the most disappointing reads ever. I, like most others, picked this book having read so many thrilling, couldn't-put-down works by James Patterson. So sorry I did -- quit halfway through -- too tortuous."
2,Peterson's culinary schools,"This book was pretty beat up, but readable. In fairness, I ordered used, but in the past any used item I've ordered has been in excellent condition so maybe I'm just spoiled."
3,Halfway There,"Beyonce', marketed and produced to appear to be the new Janet Jackson, is a better singer than JJ by about a million miles.It is her marketing and production team that is crippling Beyonce's artistic arc. The marching-band-on-crack horns on ""Crazy In Love"" are fantastic, but the decision to drop in the now-obligitory ABAB rhyming of Jay-Z brings the record to a stumbling end. Even worse are the mumbled ramblings of P. Diddy (or P-Daddy or Puff Daddy or whatever silly name The Most Overrated Man In Show Business is going by these days) on ""Summertime."" It could have been a nice record, but the King of Self Promotion killed it.Beyonce' needs to set aside the pseudo-Janet Jackson pretentions and kick the washed up rappers off of her records before I'll be able to take her seriously. If she must ape another musician, Diana Ross would make more sense. Beyonce' may have the pipes to pull it off."
4,Crazy In Love,"The remixes are pretty fun, but I think I prefer the single version above all. I was never really into Beyonce, or Destiny's Child for that matter, but this song's really infectious and the message is cool. ^_^ Pretty cool song."
1,Great While It Lasted,"I was excited when I first saw this item on Amazon and was pleased by the price. I wind up my headsets and store them in a very small pocket in my fanny pack. All that bending wasn't good for them and eventually the wires frayed. So the idea of having one that wound up and fit very neatly into the pocket was great. I could overlook the fact that the microphone was above my ear (I'd had a Jabra before that had that feature...annoying but worh dealing with.I am now VERY disappointed because after a little over one month since I bought it, the microphone no longer works--apparently there's a short in the wiring. I can hear fine, but can no longer be heard. Now that I've read a few of the more recent reviews (including the May review I just read) I see that this is a common flaw. No wonder they are now selling for $13 bucks!So for me the search continues for a high quality, compact, durable headset. Save your $13 (unless you plan to spend $156 and get a year's supply!)"
3,Microphone at wrong place,"I bought this for my wife thinking its WindUP feature is cool and makes it easier to carry the set. It turns out that because of the feature, the microphone has to be placed on the earbud. Very often, the microphone is covered by hair and can not pick soft voices. My wife has to speak loudly when using the headset. It is definitely not for people having long hair. Other than that, it seems working well. So I gave it 3 stars."
2,Wears out too fast,"Like other reviewers here, my unit went bad after about a month of casual use. It seems there's a short of some kind in the wire at the point where the connector plugs into my phone. I did not treat it roughly, and judging from the other reviews, this seems a common problem. Too bad, it's a nice idea, but who has the money to keep replacing this every month??"
3,"Nice product, but not as good as older models","I love the wind-up cord feature of this model, but the sound quality doesn't come close to the older model I have from a few years ago. I did ""sound"" tests with my friends, and the sound quality of my older EarBud is so much better than this new one. Maybe the quality of the manufacturing is not as good, or maybe I should return this one and try another one. It is a nice little unit though if you couldn't compare the quality of the two with each other."
3,hands free,"Jabra products are comfortable to wear including this earset.The microphone is built into the ear piece and it seems it's hard for people to hear you talking. and also the cord doesn't always wind up correctly. And it doe get tangled. One of them I had to take apart.I ordered two of them, and I thought the shipping on the 2 small items wasVERY EXPENSIVE for the weight and size of this item ."
3,Another one bites the dust.,"I love (I mean loved) the wind up feature of this ear piece. However, as reported by others the microphone portion has now died after 6 months and the copper wires are exposed. When this works it's great, but I am now debating whether to buy another one or move on to a new company."
2,Good but fragile,"I have now had two of these devices. I love the way that they fit in my ear and the convenience and compactness. They also sound good, both receiving and transmitting. The problem is that something happened in the plug of both units after a few months that rendered them useless. I was not rough on them either."
3,Met a sudden death,"Microphone on my headset just died without any warning - after about 10 months of light use - considering I paid $30+ for it originally, that's a bit early.The good:I like wind-up idea, and the gel earpiece feel just right in my ear.The bad:I hate how wind-up started tangling wires after about 3-4 months and how the mike just died."
4,"Great space saver, but I miss the button","New phone = new headset so I thought I'd go with the winder, since the cord frequently gets caught in my car. This product is great - it's not good for noisy places, but what headset is? I've never had anyone ask me to repeat things or complain about sound quality, so I'm very happy with it. Users of older Jabra models will appreciate the locking eargels.Pros:Cord winder keeps cord untangled when storedLocking eargelsCons:No answer/end button on cord"
2,"like the winder, but poor sound quality","Con: I am disappointed in the poor sound quality of this device. Peoples voices are muffled and hard to discern. It sounds as though everyone is talking with a hand over their mouth on my end, but I have had no complaints about how I sound on the other end. Maybe the mic is good and the speaker bad, or maybe I've just got a defective product.Pro: As the winder goes, I like it a lot. It is small and lets you put the whole thing in your pocket without tangle. This winder works like a miniblind. You pull both ends of the cord out a tad, then it retracts. I've never had a problem operating it.This comes as a disappointment as I had a good experience with my last and similar jabra earbud - sounded good, and fit well - much better than my 'body glove' (too big for my ear, fell out constantly, and hurt) or my 'plantronics' (would always fall out, impossible to put in in time to answer a call)."
4,I have strange ears...,"Since I have odd ears, the options with the eargels seemed perfect for me. I haven't had any problems with the retraction feature or with sound quality. I would recommend the WindUP with no hesitation."
2,"great fit, flimsy spool","I've had this EarSet for about a year. The fit is very comfortable and the sound is good. People on the other end can hear me well, although I have had complaints about wind noise from my car A/C system.The worst part of the EarSet is the flimsy design. The reel that holds the cord is not very well designed. Mine broke after about a month. Getting the wire to retract back into the reel can be a hassle. Sometimes the wire would feed down the side of the reel, causing it to jam. After it broke, I disassembled the reel and have used it since by just wrapping the cord around my phone."
4,"Happy enough with mine, several months","I've used an ""earset"" for several months. The windup feature was the big attraction for me. Despite my suspicions, people all tell me that - at least on my instrument - the tiny ear-level microphone comes over loud and clear. I wish there were more options in the windup category, because of the numerous reviews that in the long run the Jabra wires will fail. I believe I had a cheaper, non-Jabra-brand wind up before this one, and it just fell apart in a few weeks. As others have pointed out, internet prices by August 2005 range anywhere from the original $29 list to $10 closeouts."
2,Very freaky song...,"`For the record, I really like George Michael and his music, but this song... I didn't like it at all. Lyrics is very cheesy, video is overproduced, something that Michael Jackson would make. I really don't care for mixes in this single. I guess justifying the ""bathroom incident"" with Outside was not enough, and he lowered himself to remind listeners that he is a freak (or ""freeek"" or whatever). Sound is certainly new and I like it. It sounds like he picked up from Faith era to`` sound more like Prince, but I really don't think I need anymore songs to confirm that he is a ""sexual freak."" He already made his point long time ago. Why bother reminding it again and again. On the good note, Freeek 2 CD is far superior single since it has ""The Long & Winding Road,"" beautiful song truly showing his beautiful voice.`"
3,"Wake up, George!","I've been a fan of George since 1984 and I'm used to his ever changing style, his beautiful remixes and everything but here with the scumfrog mixes, he turns it into a complete failure and I'm relieved not to have purchased this. The original version of the song is a delight...once you get used to it and it really gets into your mind but those mixes are just awful, the beautiful voice is removed and it is only noise basically. I am very surprised that George blames the record company for the failure of this single when in fact he is to be blamed for having it remixed by that bunch of talentless guys. Come on now, George, listen to those mixes and wake up!"
2,not much to get excited about,"past first Songs were ""FastLove""&""Outside"".this Ain't it.this Song is like ""Monkey"" Part 2 Meets Trent Rezinor Meets Madonna ""Erotica&Ray OF Light"".Meaning safe Predictable Music.this song is More Hype than Happening to me.look to hearing the rest of the Album&Hope it gets better.He is a Good Songwriter,Vocalist,Arranger&Producer but His True Talents aren't showcased here fully at all."
1,not convincing,"This reads more like a tabloid article or a conspiracy web-site, than it does a book. The author relies 100% on theory and conjecture, offering no evidence. If Hitler did escape, we have had 60+ years to find evidence and report it...instead we read 120 pages of inane dribble about what could have happened.The matter is settled issue: suicide."
4,Absolutely worth reading....,"The book is quite short and easy to read. Yes, there are grammatical errors that should have been corrected prior to publication. But this is still worth reading. The author uses previously published information, so if you're looking for some new piece of information or research, you won't find it here. This relies on post-war interviews with those who were close to Hitler and survived. Most of the people in the bunker in the final days didn't quite make it. I would have liked to see some supporting evidence gathered from Spain or Argentina. Maybe some information about the various planes flying out of Germany during the last days. Or some information regarding civilian or military boats that left the area."
4,Hitler's Escape,"A startling revelation of what really happened in the bunker. The evidence presented in this book showing that Hitler escaped in 1945 from Berlin, instead of committing suicide, is quite strong and convincing. This book makes very good reading. I recommend it."
1,Dreamlad,This book was very interesting but to bad it was not fiction. This book sounds like it comes from a revisionist who is denying the Holocaust. Dream on--we all know Hitler killed himself.
5,Clear practice guide to Path of Purification,"The Path of Purification is the most comprehensive meditation guide of the Theravada tradition. It is, however, quite complex, and it can be difficult to find the information you need to devlop a meditation practice. While everyone who is interested in this meditation tradition should eventually get around to reading the original, this book can help you start a meditation practice immediately. The author has done a wonderful job of separating out the material that pertains to modern meditators. This book may be even more meaningful to people who already have some experience with meditation and Buddhism. It is interesting to find how appropriate a 1700 year old plan for meditation can be :)"
1,sloppy packaging,"The company that shipped two sets of tongs placed both in a flimsy manila envelope. As a result, the 9"" tong fell out. Contacted the company and they said they would ship a replacement 'as soon as possible.' Never heard from them again. Had to contact Amazon.com and issue a complaint and ultimately received a refund about 30 days after original order. Moral: try walmart of target first and get product immediately and for a much better price."
4,A wonderful little book,"First let me say that I've actually taken the time to write a review because I'm about to purchase this book again, it truly is a wonderful little book. I find it quite appropriate for someone either already engaged in a relationship or in the inital stages of one. The questions are a mixture of multiple choice and open ended and range from personality to viewpoint to general preferences.The only thing I don't care for is the very first page of the book which states You have been selected by an admirer as a potential candidate for: ___________I think properly answering that question (especially for those of us in a relationship) takes a bit of creativity to ensure you don't impose limits or suggest more than you are currently interested in. Other than that it's great, with many questions that just may not come up in a general conversation. And the price is perfect!"
1,Not the Classics,"Being a strict purist when it comes to the classic nursery rhymes, I was very disappointed when I listened to this CD. Not only do none of the songs sound like the original nursery rhymes, they all sound the same. Sadly, I found that the tune the artist chose became irritating after a few songs. Additionally, the songs do not blend well together. They come to abrupt end and then there is a brief pause or break in between each number. If you really want your child to learn nursery rhymes, you may prefer to order Baby Genius's Favorite Nursery Rhymes, (which maintains the purity of the original) or Bananas in Pajamas, It's Singing Time, A Collection of Nursery Rhymes (which incorporates some fun while teaching the nursery rhymes.)"
2,Not what I expected,This book was not what I expected. It was way too technical and above the average lay persons language and idealology. Plus I did not agree with all the authors views. It was just not what I was looking for when I read the title. Kind of misleading.
3,a little small but nice,"i purchased this for my girlfriend for valentines day and she loves it. i think its a little small. if they offered one a little bigger id buy it. if she is petite it will really look good, and its a good conversation piece.i also purchased the imitation ruby heart offered on amazon. it is a little bigger and really looks good."
3,Pendant was nice but the chain was flimsy,I purchased this item for my wife as a Valentines present.She really liked it but later complained that the chain's clasp was VERY hard to open and close. I tried to put it on her myself and found it so small that even though I could see it clearly it was hard to get it to open and join it with the loop. I will get her a new chain but it will be hard because the loop on the heart is so small that it can only handle a very thin chain which also meens a small clasp.
4,Worth it,I got this for my girlfriend as a gift. She thought it was great. As others have said it fit her personality and is a conversation starter. For the price it is worth it.
5,I love it,I received this beautiful pendant from my husband for Valentine's Day. I have had many compliments on it. The pendant is just the right size for me. It's not huge and not to small you can clearly see the detail of the horns and tail.
2,way too small,This item is way to small about the size of a nickel. I bought it for my wife and she returned it.
3,14k Gold Heart Devil Diamond Pendant (.04 ct),My wife loves it but I think she just says that so as not to say your cheap. The item is cute however she wears a cross pendant too that is not very big and this thing looks like a small version of what one should be. Micro-sized.When selling jewelry they should be forced to show actual size photos. The chain is so thin and the hole is so small that you can not put a heavier chain on to replace the junky one that comes with it.
2,Delicate is an understatement,"I wound up returning this item the same day it arrived. I was buying it for myself because it looked so cute. Yeah it is - if you're about 14 years old. It is way too small for an adult. The detail is nice, but good luck seeing any diamonds unless you're planning on also wearing a jeweler's glass along with it."
2,14k gold heart devil pendant,Its very small in size and very fragil and the tail part gets snugged on things.
2,devilish,"Is devilish but very, very small. Should have paid more attention to size. Chain useless. Not worth the money."
4,"A classy, top notch thriller.","Based on the William Diehl novel, ""Sharky's Machine"" is a slam-bang, relentless rollercoaster ride of thrills. Amidst the backstreets of Atlanta, Sharky, as played by Burt Reynolds, goes head to head with a ruthless crime lord to solve the murder of a high class call girl. With his motley team of cohorts, he finds himself embroiled in corruption, organized crime and doublecrosses. Despite violence that is often graphic and bloody, ""Sharky's Machine"" is a fast paced, and frequently funny adult thriller. Film's most unusual aspect is the jazz soundtrack. Dismissing the usual film score, director Reynolds substitutes a fine collection of modern and classic jazz. A fine effort from Reynolds and company, making one forget such duds as ""Stroker Ace"", and the ""Cannonball Run"" films."
3,Exciting if a bit predictable thriller.,"Burt has assembled his usuall strong supporting cast in this police drama/action thriller. The ""Machine"" is the Vice squad that Reynolds heads... And when a $1000/per night call girl is murdered while under surveylance, they are thrown into a murder/drugs/polictical corruption plot. The twist comes when Reynolds starts falling for the call girl, played by the lovely Rachel Ward, *after* she is killed. All in all, a good movie, even though you can figure out where its going pretty early on. Check it out."
4,Atlanta gets the major city treatment!,"Burt Reynolds continued his love affair with Georgia's capital by setting his ultraviolent crime saga in the city of the South. The Atlanta background is only window dressing for a tale that could occur in any metropolis in the U.S.Reynold's directing is tight and he does well in the title role. Great support comes from Rachel Ward, Brian Keith, veteran heavy Henry Silva, Bernie Casey, Reynold's longtime friend Charles Durning, and the always reliable Earl Holliman.The film may not make any ""best of"" lists, but it is still an enjoyable cop drama, with exciting twists and turns, plus it provides an early '80's glimpse of crime in urban America.."
3,Solid Crime Thriller Deserves Widescreen DVD,"Burt Reynolds rose from the ""good ol' boy"" quagmire to deliver this hard-edged crime drama. Easily his best directorial effort, Reynolds invests ""Sharky's Machine"" (1981) with a strong sense of ensemble, gritty Atlanta locations and some truly memorable stunts. Unfortunately, Burt's commendable police thriller has been given the budget-DVD treatment - resulting in a standard full-frame transfer and no extras. Warner Home Video should release ""Sharky's Machine"" in its original widescreen format as a 30th anniversary ""special edition."""
4,Burt's Best,"This is the movie in which Burt Reynolds put all of his considerable (but often underused) talent to work, both as actor and director. Surrounding himself with colorful characters, Reynolds plays it appropriately cool. As a director, he coaxes excellent performances from his co-stars (Bernie Casey's improvised monologue is among the highlights) and his direction is taut and confident. The film desperately needs remastering. With a remake in the works, maybe it will get one."
4,HERE COMES SHARKY!,"This is the best nior movie since ""Body Heat"" Burt Raynolds is wonderful I would have to say this is his best performance as an actor and his directing is pretty good to. The soundtrack to the movie is one of the best of the 1980's it features Sarah Vaughn and Joe Williams but it is very VERY Hard to find , Burt Raynold stars in and directs this atmospheric, volatile action thriller about an Atlanta cop whose gung-hotactics on a narcotics case gets him demoted to the vice squad. there he forms a colorful crew into a ""MACHINE"" aimed at a bigger pray: crimelord Vitor D'Anton (Vittorio Gassman). Playing vital cogs in ""Sharky's Machine"" are Brian Kieth, Charles Durning, Bernie Casey, Richard Libertini, Henry Silva and John Fiedler. Rachel Ward is a call girl who sets Sharky's personal and professional world spinning. It's easy to get attached to the likeable Characters these pros create. But beware. In sharky's bullet-for-bullet world, even the good die fast."
2,Why no widescreen?,This is probalby Burt Reynold's best performance. It's a shame they don't release this movie in 1.85:1 format so it would look nice on a widescreen HDTV.
5,Reynolds' Best Film,"One of the best cop films of the 70's and 80's and probably Burt Reynolds' best film he ever made. Great set of actors (Charles Durning, Bernie Casey, and Brian Keith) who all play very well off of each other. Some of Burt's best acting and directing. I am very surprised to see this film usually get mediocre reviews. This is gritty, intellegent, and has an engaging story. Reynolds does a nice job with flow and I disagree that it is slow moving. I would like to see a special edition DVD of this with Reynolds' commentary and additional features."
5,Atlanta,A story of Atlanta and the political actions involved in the events of crime and the law. Well played by all the characters with a feel of reality in what events transpired. If you are a jazz buff at the same time the background music was top notch.
4,Nice faucet for the price,"I (women) had to replace my faucet myself. No it wasn't simple but what is. I love the look of this faucet, instant update. It was worth the money & the hassle to install for me. It wasn't the faucets fault, it's easy. My plumbing was the problem."
4,Nice style and great pressure. The handles however...,Easy install and looks fantastic. The handles seem to be tight when you turn on the water. We are very happy with this product.
4,unbelievably good customer service!,"I purchased this faucet in May of 2011. It arrived quickly, looked beautiful and was just what I wanted. My plumber installed it and we were very happy.Last week it started to leak. The plumber came and said the leak was within the base and that, even if he could fix it, it would be so time-intensive it probably wouldn't be worth it.I went back to the seller through Amazon and emailed them about the situation this morning. WITHIN 1 HOUR I had a response - ""new one on its way.""I don't have it yet, but expect I will by the beginning of next week.I could not be more impressed with the customer service. I wish it wasn't remarkable, that every vendor had this as their standard. But they don't, so I will celebrate and heap praise on those who do.If the part hadn't broken it would've been 5 stars - and then some. This is a very attractive faucet set (with sprayer) and the price was very reasonable. The great service is icing on the cake."
4,Nice Faucet,This is a very nice looking and well built kitchen faucet at a reasonable price. It was much harder to remove the old leaky faucet set than it was to install the new one.
4,"Metallica and Faithfull-the ""already faded prima donna""","Great guitar work, Hetfield's voice at it's best, and the infamous whiskey-soured voice of Marianne Faithfull. What could go wrong? Not much. I saw the band and Faithfull do this song live on ""SNL"" a while back, and it rocked. The video creeped me out though. ""Da da da da, da da, da da da da da,"" sings Marianne while grinding an organ. Scary sh*t, kinda like this song. It would be a great single if it weren't for that god-awful remix. Arrgh!"
5,It's ok but album is better,"I feel i must inform peopel that regardless of what that other guy said.. marianne faithfull has been 6 feet underground for several, several years now from an overdose.. those were soundclip vocals so where this guy gets off saying he saw her perform on snl is absolute bull.. its still a really good cd but if you want the song go buy the cd reload it is very good"
2,It's a 1-song CD,"I call this a one-song CD because you play through ""The Memory Remains"", which is a great song, but then the remix of ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" just kills it all. It's bad enough that they even made a Metallica song into techno, but DJ Spooky did such a terrible job of it!"
5,A clever way to introduce the immigrant experience.,"A grandfather tells his grandaughter tall tales about each stage in his immigration to the U.S. and his early life in New York. Then the grandmother deflates each tale and explains how things really were back then. I find this two-step process to be a clever way to teach children about the experience which their grandparents went through, first hooking them with a silly story, and then hitting them with the facts. The book is especially useful for reading aloud to children whose grandparents can no longer tell the story themselves, or for inspiring children to ask their grandparents about their experience. This is a rather matter-of-fact review, so I should add that my children and I find this book funny and endearing, and have read it together many times."
5,Good children's book.,Excellent illustrations in this picture book. Good story for giving children a view of what it is like to be an immigrant.
4,Great,"I very much enjoyed this book. I purchased and read this 5 years ago at the Arizona Memorial bookstore. I wanted to learn more about the subject and found this to be a well written piece that made it feel as if you were there. It was informative and flowed well. This would be a great book for someone who is coming in that does not know alot about the subject. For people who know most of the stories, I would recommend more detailed texts on the particular subject that you liked."
5,Very Happy,"TIC ASP-12 ARCHITECTURAL SERIES 120-WATTS PATIO SPEAKER, BLACK I hung these from my vaulted ceiling in my living room, they are my B speakers to cmpliment my Array twealths which are serious. What a great combination. They are very well made and the brackets worked so nice fom the beams allowing me to angle them down at the position I wanted. I would recordmend these also to be on there own or 2 pairs of these together Im sure would be great also. And the price is right!"
4,Great multi purpose speakers,"These are great! Have many sets being used in different places. Some outside, some inside and some connected via a 70v line for use as PA speakers.The mounting brackets are strong and simple to install and the speakers sound great for the price."
5,Excellent !!!,Update 7/4/2010: This was a great purchase. I'm still pretty surprised how well they sound. Don't let the low price mislead you. They are well built and look pretty good mouinted outside.Don't get fooled into paying hundreds more...these sound great. Note that these speakers are weatherproof..not just weather resistant.
2,Poor quality,I got these and opened them up only to find a nice scratch on one of the grills. Had a choice to make....decided to get the black magic marker instead of the hassle of returning. Poor Quality. Wouldn't buy again.
2,Committed but dissapointed,This episode was a dissapointing disconnected drama that made little sense. The villan was underdeveloped and the premise of torture for marital bliss was just wierd and almost uninteresting. the twist with Lois and Clark was really good but they didn't take it far enough to make it meaningful. Lois' excuse about taking off the finger monitor was a lame way to get her our of admitting she loved Clark. It all was a dissapointment for what it could have been.
1,No spanish subtitles,Estoy muy decepcionado con esta edicion cutre de warner.Todas las temporadas anteriores en dvd y bluray contenian subtitulos en español. No entiendo porque razón en esta octava temporada han dejado fuera los subtítulos en español.
2,A non-flying superman is not superman.,"I was very disapointed in this season of Smallville, and actually the last season was somewhat disapointing as well. How can we be in season eight and Clark is not able to fly yet? I am tired of the constant bickering between Clark and Oliver. The only bright spot is Clark's unwillingness to take the lives of others, no matter the monster they might be, but come on he is superman it is time to dawn the cape and fly."
4,Super Season 8,I have all the Smallvile Seasons on DVD and this is one of my favorite seasons. It tells more of the story in a somewhat Darker light to get a more mature Superman to emerge as the hero we all love. If you love the other seasons you will love this season as well.
4,Ups and Downs,"Season 8 of Smallville is not the strongest of the series, but it is certainly not the weakest. It takes a few episodes to gain its footing before delivering some really good, entertaining episodes, but unfortunately it falls on its face a lot too. I'm not sure what the writers were thinking when they reintroduce old characters that should stay gone, but they like to beat a dead horse with the whole Romeo/Juliet love story. Smallville, unfortunately falls under the failure spell of almost all TV dramas, meaning that it refuses to let characters be happy and therefore has a tendency to let viewers down.Look forward to seeing more DC characters share the screen and watching another villain storyline develop.I'm sorry if this review seems vague, I'm trying not to give anything away."
5,Thank you very much!,"I loved watching Smallville, back while the series was running!And, I enjoyed adding this DVD package to my series collection!I was very impressed with the quality of it!Sincerely,God bless you and your family!"
4,Wonderful Season Eight...,"To all those who are saying enough of Smallville...SHUT UP! No one is forcing you to watch. Is Clark Kent ready to put on a cape and assume SUPERMAN status? Perhaps not. If you think the final episode of season eight was anti-climactic, I agree, even if the legendary face-off with Doomsday is with SUPERMAN, and not the 'Red Blue Blur'. Confusion surrounds the disappearance of Lois and too much time is spent in the finale with Chloe and not Clark. All that being said, I loved season eight for being well written and produced. Bloom and Mercer are new and interesting characters but Lex, Martha, and Lionel are sorely missed. (Is Lex really dead?) Looking forward to many more seasons of Smallville, even if they turn out to be only half as good as seasons past."
4,Great,This was a great DVD set. Think it was the weakest of all the season but still love the season and show and can be proud to release this dvd. Not a big fan of the new design of the case because my broke already. Prefered the old one but overall great DVD. 8/10
5,Smallville Mania,"As always a great show. My wife and I have the dvd for all eight seasons. unfortunately,we have to wait another year for the dvd to come out."
3,Horrible dvd sound!,"I love smallville but the dolby surround in english is so poor, raspy, and muted that it was hard for me to be engaged. I had to put on the Portuguese to get the real smallville sound and read the english subtitles! Does anyone else notice this! That the portguese sound quality is far superior to the english! Come on!"
5,smallvile 8th season,I have been buying products through amazon.com for over eight years and I am very pleased with the service and the discounts and what totell everybody to try your service and they will be very content with you as I have for the the last eight years. Mark from Tenn
2,OMG!!,"What has this show become????? If your hoping to see clark in the suit, don't count on it...I don't know how long we're gonna have to wait until then. Flash and Green arrow don't even wear their classic suits...they just wear hoodies...How gay is that!? Clark doesn't even wear disguise glasses. So there's no way the characters could be too dumb not to figure out what clark looked like with huge frames! Rosenbaum and Glover are gone, so this means we've got a middle school acting level on our hands. Stories are pointless...Tom Welling is 32! When does superman really come out!? when he's 40???? No, even if they do give us the suit their probably gonna turn it into something extremely inadequate. like give him a hood and a cape. leave the S logo out and the tights. (not that I'm in favor of the tights it's just that there authentic!)SERIOUSLY! SUPERMANS FLIGHT AND SUIT DEFINE WHO HE IS...NOW WE WANT TO SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,terrible,series is goood but cd#2 came with damaga bad experience and will never purchase from that seller ever again called piece of mind media
5,Smallville The Complete Eighth Season,"Received this disc a little bit after 2 weeks, however was within the time frame. The Smallville series continues to be one of the best tv series and can't wait for season 9, as the complete series is not available here in Hong Kong."
4,Infamous recovery,After the plain poor performances of Requium and Power I was ready to watch just one more and hand in the request to end the subscription and move on. Infamous provded the needed kick to keep my interest for a few more. I need to see at least three consistent consecutive episodes with this quality to know somebody back at the group had been permanently let go. Looking forward to the future. Please don't dissapoint.
3,For the bluray version is not all complete,"I like alot this series, but I need subtitles in the movie. I got the last 2 seasons before this one and they all got subtitles. For this season, the one on DVD has all subtitles, and the Bluray version that is suppose to be better, and doesnt have written if it is with spanish subtitles or other. Sorry of this!!"
3,Trying to delay the inevitable,"Smallville season 8 wasn't bad, but as you watch it you sometimes feel that the writers are trying to delay the inevitable, the creation of Superman."
2,Awful package for a great season,"I am from Spain, but I've been buying the previous eight seasons dvds of Smallville from the US because of the packaging. Apart from the changes since season 5, I'd always thought that the original packaging design was quite superior than the spanish slim plastic dvd editions. Until now!It's so dissapointing owning a tv series dvd collection that doesn't look good at all in your shelve. Four seasons one way, the next four with a new slim design, and now with that stupid and hugely breakable plastic sleeves that mess all the discs.Please, Warner bros people... be a little more respectul to the fans. After all, we pay your bills. Decide and overall ""MANTEIN"" the packaging of one tv show exactly the same from the first to its final season. That's the proper way to do it.Apart from that, I think that this season was absolutely great except from the season finale."
5,Amazing episode,I really liked this episode - They're moving the story forward and creating a great and entertaining episode at the same time. I liked the way Clark even changed to the blue red blur in a phone booth once on this one. Most of the younger viewers may not have caught that one cause they might not know that in the Superman comics often had him changing in a phone booth. Writers - keep it up - and don't even think about letting Clark get killed by Doomsday as happened in the stupid comic series in the '90's.
4,Finally,"Finally, finally, finally they are getting back to the basics of what made this series great! Really good episode."
1,I wish there was a lower rating than one star...,"I've loved/hated Smallville for years. It's the one show that's always had me locked in on hope alone, never because they delivered the goods. Such potential, always squandered. This season, I thought it'd be different. And, up to the ""Legion"" episode, it was. Literally, a fanboy's dream season. But, ""Power"" is the SINGLE WORST EPISODE OF ANY SHOW EVER FILMED ON ANY NETWORK OR PUBLIC ACCESS CHANNEL. HTF did this get greenlighted? I wanted to cancel my season pass after watching this! I wanted to smash my laptop against the wall to exact vengeance for this...mindrape of a tv show! This episode is disgusting, to say the least. It's convinced me of one thing that 7 years of mediocrity couldn't: this show must end this season. No more chances. End it, before you make me hate Superman forever."
1,What was that?,Been watching for every season and finally felt like they are off in la la land with that plot and about 1/3 of the dialog. It's like everybody is on drugs or something. The acting was frankly horible from everyone from Clark to Tess. It felt like some kids from highschool ran a video production project with about as much depth. So bumbed.
4,excellent rpoduct,"Plastic box was broken on the edges, but the dvd's were excellent condition. Otherwise everything about the purchase was done very professional. I would definately use seller again."
2,Super Soap,I certainly agree that the show needed to change but wasn't this ep ripped out of an old Danielle Steel novel?
1,What a disappointment,"This show used to be dumb but fun. Now it's incoherant and seems completely incapable of choosing what story it wants to tell. Chloe makes dumb choices, Clark is a jerk, there are no Luthors. The season ender to this show was abysmal and I really wish I could unsee it.No I won't buy the DVD, nor should you buy it as a gift for someone who watches Smallville unless they specifically request this season. Pretty much it ruins any good feelings towards previous seasons by ruining everyone's characterization.Go buy Chuck instead. That show understands Superman much better than Smallville."
1,excellent season,"this season package was even cheaper than Walmart""s ! Amazon always has amazing deals!"
1,Lack of spanish subtitles an upgrade from the dvd edition...?,"I have bought Smallville 5th season hd dvd and 6th and 7th seasons blu rays and ALL of them had include spanish subtitles. Why the downgrade on this one? Specially when the job its already done and the ordinary dvd edition includes them.Blu ray supossedly are an upgrade from the regulars dvds, don't ya? Explain me then why I must pay more money and get less content...? There's anyone with half a brain in the warner brothers dvd marketing department?"
5,Smallville Season 8 looks great on Blu Ray,"Having already collected the entire series on DVD up until season 8, I switched over to Blu Ray for seasons 9 & 10. The picture quality was so great I had to pick this up as an upgrade for this season. And having waited until they dropped below $20 was a major score and couldn't pass up the deal. Now, if they can just reformat seasons 1-5 and release the entire series in HD, that would be great! I totally miss this show on TV. An absolute high point in the Superman saga and the genre's presence on TV in general. Pick it up if the price is right."
5,good,"i have the whole series, am a fan sill do not like puutting in extra word to fill in this fkorm"
4,Now put on the cape,"This was a well made episode, but I still think Clark is way too serious these days. Even in a serious episode like this one, they should have a few light hearted moments in my opinion. And I hope the 9th season brings on the cape and some flight scenes. I'm looking forward to it. Smallville Rules!"
1,The worst I've seen...,"Ok this is the worst Smallville episode I've ever seen. First of all I wish Lana would have died in season 4, I feel like vomiting every time I see Lana and Clark in the barn at the end of an episode. This one however takes the cake for the worst of them all. I like a good love/tragedy story, too bad this doesn't fall in the category of ""good"", just moronic. Well hopefully we get to see some better episodes in the future!"
2,Smallville without Lex is like The X-Files without Mulder,"Smallville season eight was a disapointment. The start of the season is good, with chloe's wedding, but after that episode when Lana comes back, it tanks.I have watched Smallville from the beginning and I greatly enjoy it. The acting and story-line is great. The biggest flaw in season 8 is Lex Luthor, or the lack of Lex. To me, Lex is an ancher of the show. You could ask anyone who the villin in Superman/Smallvile is, I doubt they would say Tess Mercer, they would say ""Lex Luthor"". I know that the actor who played lex (Micheal Rosenbaum) wanted out, but then you either get a new actor or possibly wrap the show up.Like I said earlier, season 8 is good up until the episode ""Bride"" from then on it really goes down hill."
1,Bad Business,This is a great product but I got one that does not work. I emailed the person I bought it from and they were really nice about it and said they would send me another one. That was 2 weeks ago and I have never heard from them again. I sent an e-mail and did not get a reply. Will not do business with these people again.. I feel like I threw away my money. I have nothing to show for it but a collar that does not work.
5,Works Great,d a friend recommend the product. I really liked how my hair shined. I don't use a lot and I use it on my wet hair before I blow dry and flat iron it.
5,Makes my hair happy and soft!!,"I was looking for something that would actually do what it said on the label and I found it. Pantene's daily moisturizer leaves my hair soft, and manageable. I love it. People love touching my hair and they always say, ""It is so soft and pretty."" Thank you Pantene. I am in love with this product."
1,HARD AND DRY! Never AGAIN!,"My husband and I decided to update our shampoo. We bought the complete Pantene Relaxed and Natural Line. Of course...he just uses whatever I wash my hair with anyways. I used the moisturizer and hated how hard and rough my hair felt. I have healthy relaxed hair and this product almost felt as if I put some sort of gel in my hair. My husband likes it and I have to admit, it makes his hair smell and feel nice. He has no chemicals and he gets a haircut every week anyways, so im not even sure if he really counts. I wont even bother using the shampoo or conditioner. I mentioned my experienc with these products to my hairstylists who said ""oh no! That stuff is not good for african american hair!"". She referred me to use the Organic Root Stimulator line. My next stop after work is to pick their moisturizer and give it a try. My husband can have the Pantene! That stuff will never ever touch my hair again!"
2,Painful,"The plot is overworked and the characters are not credible. The hero is a young wannabe cop who has no training or experience and finds himself the main ""thinker"" in solving a complex murder case that has left everyone else around him baffled. His partner, the one with the experience, doesn't seem to have a clue. The writing is painfully elementary and has not been checked for errors."
4,"""Brother"" clone ink","It works!!! Occasionally, I have to remove the ink packet and replace it to enhance the flow of ink."
3,Should have been better,"The Israelis portrayed in the film are all crass, greedy, selfish, dishonest, exploitative, overweight slobs. What could have been an honest critique of materialistic capitalism and contemporary Israel degenerates into an apology for the Intifada, tinged with the stench of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. I guess the hate group that bankrolled this film got what they wanted."
3,Cute toy but suction is not great,"We thought this toy would keep our baby busy in his high chair while we're eating dinner, but it's pretty frustrating to him as the suction cup is weak and the toy falls over.Ah, well."
2,suction does not work,"my daughter really likes the ring toy (not the cow jumping over the moon - it's too big and clunky) but neither one stays put AT ALL! not for 2 seconds. if you want a toy that sticks, look elsewhere."
2,Suction not great,"The toys themselves are cute, but at the end of the day, those suction cups work on just about nothing. One detaches as a rattle, but it's a mighty big rattle when taken off the base and somewhat unwieldy."
1,Suction cups don't work,"We read the reviews and decided to try the prodcut anyway because it was relatively inexpensive. Maybe it makes a difference what your highchair tray is made of, but the suction cups won't stick to our plastic highchair tray at all."
2,Suction Cups DO NOT STICK well,"Save yourself the hassle. Skip this product. I was VERY Excited to purchase this for my three month old. When I got it home, I tried to suck it to the stove top. Nothing. I tried the swing tray. Nothing. I stuck it on her high chair tray, and walked away, came back 2 minutes later and it wasn't even attached. There wasn't even a baby IN the chair and it had unstuck on it's own. I finally managed to get it to stick for a short amount of time, but am very disappointed in this product. Luckily it was cheap.Save yourself the time and hassle and purchase the Fisher Price Rainforest Spinning Suction Toy. It actually does stick and STAYS Stuck. I am much happier with it. You don't even have to wet it to get it to stay."
3,inexpensive but didn't work for my 13 month old,"bought it b/c needed something to distract my little one during restaurant outingsdidn't work. didn't hold her attention, perhaps she was too old... 13 months.but it was cheap."
2,bad suction,"the toys have bad suction. My 7 month old can rip it right off her highchair. Plus, the sound does not work."
4,Facinating distraction,"This toy has so far distracted my son more than his other toys without me having to animate it. I gave it to him at 5 1/2 months and when eye-hand coordination was just good enough to allow him to thrust himself upon things. I put it on his bumbo play tray. The purple toy is much easier for him to grab onto and the sunction is stronger. While he seems to like the cow toy he manages to knock off quickly. In all, I'm happy with the purchase. Get the two and leave one at the grandparents!"
2,****PAINT SCRAPES OFF!*****,"These products were to entertain my 7 month old son while we eat dinner. I was very disappointed when they arrived and we were unable to get the cow jumps over the moon toy to stick to the high chair tray. It will stick for several seconds, then you can see it self release. We had better luck with the fascination station (this will stay most of the time), though we purchased the set so we could switch between the two to keep interest levels up. Part of the problem may be the texture of our high chair tray (Eddie Bauer), but we were also unable to get the cow to stick to the counter or our table.****Since I reviewed these toys, I have taken them away from my son because paint from the cow jumps over the moon scraped off while he was teething on it. It was in his mouth, on his face and hands!****"
2,Lasted two weeks,"While it worked, my baby (7 months) loved this toy. For us the suction worked just fine, but it was sort of moot since he was able to pull it off of the suction base and play with it. Either way, the music and sounds it produced really kept him entertained.Then two weeks later it stopped working. Not a sound, not a peep. So I pulled out my screw driver set to see if I could change the battery. Well, the toy uses triangle shaped slots in the screw head, so none of my screw drivers (slot, phillips, hex) work. So now I can't change the battery and I have a worthless toy (he's bored with it now that it doesn't make sounds)."
3,Won't stay in place,"The toy with the ring attached works good. It takes a good bit to knock it loose. The toy with the moon, however, is top heavy. It barely stays suctioned even if it's just sitting there. My son (7mo) is constantly knocking it off his high chair tray. It also does not play music anymore. It played twice, but that's all. I recommend the toy with the ring, but not the other (unless you enjoy playing pick-me-up)."
2,They don't stick & way too loud!,"We got this set for our 3 month old twins, hoping to entertain them enough for us to finish a meal.The cow doesn't stick for more than a couple seconds, and is top heavy so it hit my son in the head when it fell. It is a relatively boring toy, doesn't spin well, and it is way too loud, especially for a toy that is right in front of your baby!The other toy is better, but it also does not stick for long. Since it comes off the base, they can at least still use it and do seem to like it. The black and white part that sticks in the base is a nice size for their hands to grasp. But as a tray toy, it is not worth it."
1,Careful about DVD region,"I ordered this DVD new through Amazon (not another seller). The DVD is advertised as Region 1, but I received a Region 0, which means it won't play on DVD players purchased in the US. I'm going to return mine tomorrow."
4,Adequate Concert,"I was disappointed because I was hoping for a larger sampling of Genesis,tunes here especially since Genesis Revisited was issued the same year."
3,An Off Night for these guys:,"Not a very good concert, even with John Wetton and Steven Wilson. There was no fire or emotion, just lak-luster playing.Sorry Guys ! But I do love the other 4 dvds that I have of Steve Hackette."
3,Worth watching once,"Romantic comedy? I didn't see much romance or comedy. ""Will make you fall in love with LA all over again""? It made LA look depressing and dirty to me. ""Hugely entertaining""? Mildly entertaining, somewhat boring.Good cinematology, fine acting, interesting characters. But when the movie was finished, we looked at each other and said, ""What was the point?"" A French gay man comes to LA, has a few experiences and meets a few people, most of whom aren't very pleasant, and then goes back home to Paris. Hang on, it's a rollercoaster of emotions! NOT!""Hilarious and touching"" I didn't find anything hilarious, and the only thing touching was Jerome's innocence, or perhaps the sad, sad people he encountered. I can say I did enjoy the few nude scenes in the movie; they almost made it worthwhile."
5,"whimsical, poignant, funny","Jason Bushman's 'Hollywood Je t'aime' is full of charm. The depiction of a French gay man coming to the world of Los Angeles is whimsical, poignant and funny. And as he traverses this new world, his outsider perspective, on a place I think I know so well, is often hilarious. The film reminded me of Truffaut with its subtle humanity, funny moments, and charm."
3,A nice surprise...,"I saw this movie for the first time on Hulu and really enjoyed it. A French gay man breaks up with his boyfriend and moves to Hollywood to become an actor. Along the way he enconters some interesting characters who teach him valuable life lessons about how to survive in Los Angeles. Some other reveiwer said that it pays homage to ""The Wizard Of Oz"" and I have to agree now that I think about. I was disapotined that he didn't stay in LA and create a new life for himself and that he and Chad Allen didn't end up as boyfriends. It would have also been nice to see a make up seen with his boyfriend when he returned home. It kina leaves you hanging."
1,Not worth $2.99 or my time,"I like Chad Allen a lot and rented it because it seemed...inaccurately, as it turned out, from the misleading cover...that he'd have a big role in this...thing. Depressing. Trite. Creepy. The French lead had all the charm of a mannekin. And LA's underbelly even less. Really, what are people thinking when they write and then produce this stuff?"
2,Even the best actors can get stuck in a stinker!,"I bought this film based on other reviews and the fact that it featured one of my favorite actors: Chad Allen. While he did a good job, I can only imagine how it felt for him to be stuck in such a ""less than stellar"" role. May I suggest that you will really enjoy any of the other films he appears in. The ""Donald Strachey"" detective mysteries, (any of the four), or even ""SAVE ME"". These allow him to command the screen with a presence that is not unlike a young James Gagney! As for this film, I'm glad that I saw it, but do not need to repeat the experience!"
3,Funny? Rather not.,"A type of movie you can watch once and that's it. I found nothing funny in the movie. Starting with a really depressing picture of Paris, through hostile welcome at the airport in U.S. (which is, unfortunately, very true), to the departure of the main character back to Paris, the film is quite sad.I think what makes the movie something exceptional among others gay theme films is the acting quality. It is not bad, in some part very good indeed.I cannot give more than 3 stars, 'cause I am not completely satisfied with what I got. Nevertheless, it was not a waste of time to see it."
2,Very over-hyped,"Four stars? Are you kidding me? This makes no sense until one notices that the few five-star ratings appear to have been made by the film's marketing department. The positive ""reviews"" have so clearly been taken from the film's promotional material. It's a good reminder of how easy it is to inflate an Amazon rating.The film itself is fairly boring and simplistic. A gay Frenchman gets depressed with his life in Paris, so he decides to follow a lifelong dream and go to Hollywood--where he discovers (shocker!!) that life is just as depressing in California.The movie's climactic, epiphanic line: ""A sunny day isn't special when it happens every day.""Commence vomiting."
4,It's A Dog's Life,"In McBride's summary of the whole of Nero Wolfe's career, there is a listing of murder victims by method of killing. In this novel, one of the murder victims is a dog.I guess McBride debated on whether to list an animal killing along with human victims. Once you read this wonderful book, though, you'll understand, and probably agree with McBride's assessment.Since the plot is described elsewhere I won't rehash it. However, if you are an animal lover, this, among all of Stout's work, will be your book for sure...your desire for justice will put you right alongside a man describe as a bloodhound.That description was applied by a woman intending to insult him, but Wolfe took it as a complement. And one well deserved, I must add.Satisfactory."
2,Wolfe at Reichenbach Falls,"The climax of the Zeck trilogy, I found this unlikely and unconvincing. It's purely an adventure, with a weak mystery sub-plot. Not to be compared with the best Wolfes."
2,Read David McCullough's book,"It was a long haul reading this book. So many fictionalized relationships, so little real 1889 flood material. Don't read this one--read ""The Johnstown Flood"" by David McCullough. The story of the Johnstown Flood of 1889 is fascinating. It is best portrayed by the Johnstown Flood Museum with its Oscar-winning film, the museum at the Flood Memorial Site, and the soon-to-open Heritage Discovery Center. Anyone with a bit of interest in the 1889 Flood and Johnstown's role in the Industrial Revolution should come visit us, esp. during Labor Day Weekend when we have the annual Johnstown FolkFest. Call 814-539-1889 for more information. J. Oleksak, Johnstown, PA"
2,Yawn ... this book put me to sleep!,"I had the bad luck to be stuck on a 5-hour flight with only this book. All I can say is that is was one of the better sleep aids I have tried. Acording to the summary in the jacket, it was supposed to chronicle the lives of some of the people who were devastated by the South Fork flood in 1889.What the blurbs and reviews fail to mention is that the flood doesn't actually happen until the last few pages of the book. Leading up to the flood, the reader is dragged through a few hundred pages of vapid, shallow anecdotes of the lead characters' lives, which are at best difficult to follow and at worst utterly mind-numbing.I forced myself to finish it for lack of anything better to do, but would not recommend it to any but the most starved for diversion.And, by the way, I am a native Pennsylvanian, so I really expected better. Unless you are really in the mood to yawn, save your money and borrow this dog from the library!"
5,In Sunlight brings characters to life,"I loved this book. I especially enjoyed the fact that it was NOT a typical ""disaster book"". The full development of the characters brought the area of Johnstown and the flood to life. It made the flood generally more ""real"" to us and made it seem all the more disastrous because of the fact that it could so easily have been prevented. The stories of the characters brought the loss of life closer to home."
1,skip this book,what a drag. Hard to follow who the characters were and what they had to with the Johnstown flood. (not much). I am from that area and was looking forward to learning more about the flood but was disappointed that it was only referenced in passing and not unil the end of the book.
3,"In Sunlight, in a beautiful garden","This novel was interesting from an historical point of view, as I didn't know much about the Johnston Flood. The indifference of rich capitalists to the ""average man"" in the town below their country club was no surprise as society hasn't changed much in that respect."
3,"Simple tale, not all that impressive.","After reading Practical Magic, a book I thoroughly enjoyed, I went ahead and picked up Turtle Moon, expecting another entertaining read. Turtle Moon ended up being a disappointment.The story is rather simple and, as another reviewer mentioned, reads mostly like a combination romance/mystery novel and comprises mainly superficial characters, who aren't developed far enough to create any impression.The part involving the individual who is discovered to be guilty of the crime has a history with another character and this is utterly unbelievable. What are the chances? The coincidences amoung the characters seem so unlikely that I felt that these happenings were merely created to make a more easy to write, shorter, less complex story. Very convenient for the author.On a plus, the story reads VERY fast, so whether or not one enjoys the book, it'll be over in a few days!"
5,Heart Wrenching Novel,"If I had to name my three favorite authors, Alice Hoffman would be right up there with Diane Chamberlain and Chalotte Vale Allen. In Turtle Moon, Alice Hoffman has done a masterful job of showing how a young boy, perceived as ""the meanest boy in Verity"" is anything but! This mean boy rescues a baby from a murderous father and goes on the run with him.An unforgettable novel about the healing power of love and the folly of making assumptions based on appearances and innuendo."
1,Alice failed twice,"For some reason I gave Alice Hoffman a second chance. After reading Seventh Heaven and finding Alice boring and tiresome, I grabbed Turtle Moon off the bookshelf on the way to the airport.Bottom Line: If I had to read the phrase: ""The meanest boy in Verity"" one more time, I think I would have thrown the book across the room.The characters actions were not logical. Lucy's son is missing so she screws the nasty policeman? What is that all about? I cared nothing for any of the characters and could not even bear to finish the book.I am seriously thinking of starting my next barbeque with this book. I'll have to throw ""Deep End of the Ocean"" on the fire too.Alice Hoffman is not for me. YAWWWNNNN!"
3,its was very nices book,"It is a mix of murder and magic inte the Florida sunshine as only Hoffman.As well as for having more divoreed women from New York than any other town in the star'te of Florida. Lucy Rosen is one of those women. she has recently moved to Verity, and what she doesn't know yet is that in May, when the turtles come out and crawl across the roads, anything can happen. That was alittle of my reviews"
2,Good If You Need a Nap,"When I started reading this book, I thought the way it was written was great, jumping from character to character and building up details. I soon found that was the only great thing about this book.Hoffman throws little bits of philosophical thoughts at the beginnings and ends of her chapters, to sound more quotable. But overall who would want to quote phrases like ""the meanest boy in Verity"". The book was slow-moving, repetitive, predictable, and frankly ridiculous. Why would anyone want to have sex with a crazy cop with an ugly face and two vicious dogs who stalked you? I think that the characters are warped and I in no way could relate to any of them. The writing wasn't bad, but Hoffman needs to build a better plot.I may just have to keep this book around for occations when I need a good nap or feel like reading about some people who are possibly more annoying that my co-workers."
2,"Sorry Alice, didn't like this one much at all. .. .","I kept expecting the book to get better, but it never achieved what started out as an adult fairy tale with spiritual significance and mystical influence. There were only a couple of time that I felt sincerely moved by a passage in the book. Its a good thing I read Here On Earh, and At Risk before Turtle Moon or I may never have given Hoffman any more of my reading time. This is a good childrens's book (teens); however its mentally and emotionally lacking for the mature reader."
3,Entertaining but unbelievable,"Our book club, located on the North Shore of Long Island (which is NOT depicted very favorably), chose this book for February 2006. It was an easy read, an enjoyable read. (2 points in my book!) However, I found the plot, characters, and development of both highly unbelievable-but maybe in fiction one suspends ALL disbelief...? To me, this suspension was overwhelming. I enjoyed the book, but on later introspection found so MANY loose ends....These loose ends hampered my love of the story. Albeit, Turtle Moon is very well written, entertaining and a dedecent read. Alot better than most of the schlock that is out there....I guess that sometimes one must suspend one's disbelief and just go along for the ride and the hope that one will will enjoy the mysticism of a turtle moon, or a full moon, at that."
2,"To be honest? A sappy, amateurish novel.","I found this to be an immature and unbelievable novel, young and girly. I couldn't believe in the characters or in the storyline, and I can't imagine trying another Hoffman novel after this flop.I don't mean to offend anyone here, but I think this story is best suited for people who enjoy the ""romance"" genre. There's nothing at all wrong with that, but I expected something different and something more literary."
4,Good story with a fatal flaw,"Love the characters, love the writing style, love the way the story builds. But there's quite a few things that don't add up, and one fatal flaw.The character of the mother that runs away from her husband with her 1 year old daughter, is repeatedly described as extremely attached to her baby. And yet, she leaves her baby alone in the apartment building's laundry room, in a hamper, to get something from her unit a few floors above (where she gets murdered)? Especially when she knows that she had been followed a few days before? That's the fatal flaw."
3,Meanest Kid in Verity,"A quirky little novel about a disturbed twelve year old boy - ""the meanest kid in Verity,"" (Texas, that is) who only finds true love and devotion when he meets up with Arrow, the meanest dog in town. It is Arrow's master, Police Investigator and K-9 handler, Julian Cash, who introduces the two and by understanding their bonding, finally comes to terms with his own tragedy and loss twenty years earlier. Julian is the hero, though bumbling and vulnerable and nave and becomes the epitome of the human desire for redemption. It is a lovely story full of idealistic romance and a mystery that keeps the reader turning the pages."
2,Light and fluffy.....,"This my second Hoffman book, the first being ""Here on Earth"", and it reinforced my opinion of her writing. Hoffman is a talented story teller who adds an interesting otherworldliness to her novels but there is not much else about her style to grab on to. The prose is basic, the characters under developed, and some of the events are so implausible that they become irksome. She also tends to recreate the divorced or unhappily married woman with a mixed up teenager in her books. In this particular book the numerous divorced female characters all blend together. This makes it difficult to remember who is who and what their histories are (something that you need to follow for the story to make sense). All in all, Hoffman is a great read for the train or beach she but doesn't really challenge or satisfy me."
4,Another Hoffman Hit!,"Alice Hoffman has scored again with Turtle Moon, a grown up fairy tale with a twist. I love how Hoffman's books deal with characters who may be unlovely on the outside, but who turn out out to be beautiful on the inside (and vice versa!). Overall, her characters are heartbreakingly human, and my heart breaks everytime I read Hoffman's books. So cathartic; and so irresitable!"
4,A Great Read,"I expected this to be more of a family drama. I liked the murder/mystery twist. Again, Alice gives us complex characters to follow. Her spare prose enabled the plot to keep moving. This is a good book."
5,it made you feel with the story and you knew every character,In most books you only get to know 2 or 3 people'but in turtlemoon you know the whole town as if you grew up there youself.The story was so very intriguing as to how noone ever is outwardly as they truly are on the inside.
2,Expected to get a cow and horse,This set was not what I expected and wanted to make clay ornaments. It would be helpful if the animals included were listed.
3,not the mini size and thin metal,"I just got the farm animal, dino and marine sets. They are too big to me (about two to three times than the animal crakers on the market). The material is also thin. However, I got around $3/set, which is reasonable. I will give them 3 and half stars."
5,not a floaty toy,"These turned out to be nice in the end.. but the definately wont float as there are two holes in them. I ended up using them as a pattern for cookie dough, play dough, jello and in the classroom for kids to draw cute animal shapes. They are the best and made from quality material. This material looks as if could withstand anything, because one student ""mason"" sat on one and it didnt even bend!"
1,disapointed,I bought the set because I thought there was a horse cookie cutter in the set. Unfortunatly there was not. My grandaughter was very disapointed since it was for her birthday. My fault...I should have looked at the product discription closer.
2,Incorrect track listing,"Get prepared to roll the dice again with Kontor Sunset Chill Vol.2.Some tracks are presented in their entirety whilst others have hadthe guts chopped out of them.On top of that,they seemed to be having trouble with a correct trk listing.Trk 12 is listed on the disc as 'Satin Souls-Recover' when in factits 'Lovebirds-The Limit'Trk 13 is listed as 'Lovebirds-The Limit' when in fact its 'SatinSouls-Recover'"
5,A blessing to those who get the cd,I have to say it is a blessing to hear this cd. For those who love Hip Hop you are going to love how Hip Hop shows the love if Jesus and as well you will be blessed by it.
1,"Grating and Awful, waste of money","The vocals were grating and irritating, the accompanying music/instruments were terrible, my babies hated it."
5,Let's Hope This News Spreads Quickly,"I totally agree with the author that there is only one thing that will deal with all the religious bigotry, arrogance and hypocrisy in the world, and stop the conflict and violence that it has wrought.That one thing is the real God's honest truth -- the eternal, universal truth that is at the core of all religions -- the delivery of which fulfills the prophecies of all religions.The prophesied message delivered by the messenger for the Spirit of truth will fly in the face of religious false shepherds who claim to be Christians or Jews or Muslims. And it will help their flocks see how and why they have been divided, misinformed, and terribly misguided.The messenger explains how the prophets Isaiah and Jesus foretold that he would be rejected by his generation, but I gather that he cannot tell us how long that will be. I hope it won't be for too much longer."
1,"NOT Sturdy, bent instantly. I don't reccomend this brand.","I bought 6 of these for my flower boxes. I originally had two old Flower box holders that i decided to get new holders because they werent looking so hot (rusty and no paint). I received them and placed my 36"" planter, as these are advertised to hold, and it bent the <cheap> metal and almost fell to the ground. Not worht sending back for a refund, i ended up doubling up 3 flower boxes with 2 of these Holders each and used the other, older holders on the outside area.The shape was exactly what i was looking for, the product is made out of cheap metal and will not hold a 36"" box as advertised.Unhappy with the product."
1,Great if your flower box weighs 5 pounds.,I bought this hoping to hang my flower box on my porch railing. It looked like an awesome deal. I got the product in the mail and it is pretty flimsy. I hung it on my railing and put the flower box on it and it immediately bent and had I not been holding part of the weight would have spilled onto the floor. I have a 32 inch flower box and it is what I would consider average weight for what it is. I even tried putting two of these flower boxes holders next to each other and sitting one flower box on both to distribute the weight and it still bent and was about to fall off. The crummy part is that the seller does not refund shipping. The shipping is more expensive than the product so if you want to return the item it will cost you more money. So basically it is trash.
1,Bent instantly should've trusted other bad reviews,"Just as the other bad reviews mentioned, this railing bent instantly with the flower box that is marked as a pairing for it on Amazon. Very disappointed, which there were better options on Amazon."
1,Total Disappointment in this product!,"If there were negative stars for this product, that is what I would have clicked versus a one star rating. This product is very deceptive in description and the quality is one of the worst I have ever experienced in a product. After this product was supporting this planter boxDynamic Design MB3612TC Medallion Deluxe 36-Inch Poly Window Box with Saucer, Terra Cottain which the hanger was displayed to be bought with, the whole planter box suddenly ended up on the ground dumping the box and destroying various plants that were in it. The product, this hanger worked for about one week, then went straight...totally losing the ability to support anything. It should be noted that the product description boasts of being able to support this size of planter box. Do not be deceived!There is a small selection of these on Amazon to order, but I would certainly discourage ANYONE from even considering this item. I lost over $20.00 in plants due to this defective product."
1,WHAT A JOKE,"this product is flimsy, poor cheap plastic that is falsely advertised.THERES NO WAY THIS THING WILL HOLD MORE THAN WHAT THEY CLAIM, ESPECIALLY A 36 INCH PLANTER.THE MOMENT I USED IT STARTED TO BEND.AND WORSE I HAVE TO PAY TO SHIP IT BACK, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND THIS SELLER IS VERY VERY SLOW, WENT PAST DUE DATE."
2,Only solution I have found,"After reading the previous reviews, I decided to purchase two and buy plastic 18"" plant containers to keep the weight to a minimum. Out of the box, one rests perfectly on the railing and is not influenced by the weight of the container. The second one droops several degrees so the plant container (smaller than the HoldAll Holder) slides to the front and is at an angle. Not ideal. I haven't seen another skinny iron railing solution, so this will do for now. I am considering trying to bend the metal to make a better fit, but I don't want to reduce what limited strength it has, so I may try and cut a piece of plywood to stick under the bar that cantilevers the weight off of the rails to support it some."
3,Railing Flower Box,"Works well for apartment patios, but isn't the more sturdy. We've had a few strong storms and my planters and the box holder always end up on the ground in a mess..."
3,Okay for dad but nor really for me,"I think there are different versions of this book. The one I have has a beatiful frog on the front, that looks so classic, so old fashioned. The book has lots of rhymes and dad enjoys it because it is so complete. I only like it when mum or dad read the rhymes to me - I must admit thought there are some in there that I did not see anywhere else. Valerie."
5,fascinating history,"Covering all kinds of rhymes, songs and riddles from the familiar to more obscure ones, the Opies give the history of each with b/w illustrations. Amazing to see the text of 'I have four sisters' written in the early 14th century. Also to learn the derivation of poems we think of as intrinsically English; thus 'as I was going to St Ives' comes from a Latin version of 1200 where 7 men were traveling to Rome, each with 7 donkeys with 7 sacks... Or to read that 'ladybird, ladybird, fly away home' has almost identical versions in France, Germany and Scandinavia and is thought to date from ancient pagan worship. Really unputdownable"
2,Good for adults but not for children,This book is for adults who are interested in the origin of nursery rhymes. Do not buy this book for children. There are hardly any illustration and none of them are in color.
1,Worse than before....,"This game is worse than before. The commentary is boring. The batting is bad. And, the graphics are not realistic enough. I rate this game as worse than before because it shows very little progress from last year's version.EA Sports needs to create games that make you feel you are at or participating in a REAL game (look, sound and feel). They are taking steps backwards instead of forwards."
1,The answer to Barry Bonds,"The reason Bonds isn't in this game, or any others I think, is the same reason he wasn't in ASB 2005.... He's an a-hole! He decided to be a jerk (surprise) and would not let any of these games portray him. Just Barry being Barry. If you ask me, the games are much better without the #1 druggie in baseball."
5,MVP Baseball 2005,"I am very satisfied with my purchase, the game i bought works great, being a huge baseball fan, the game gives me everything i want, glad i found it here."
5,The Best Baseball Game,"I have gotten the MVP series since 2003 and it is by far the best baseball video game out there. The graphics are better, the gameplay is better, and every baseball fan out there should get this game. They have added pretty much everything you could think of, including arguing with the umpire on bad calls."
4,Still the best out there,"Look, if the ""hitter's eye"" feels like cheating to you, then turn it off. You can do that. I think the fielding is still hard, but it's supposed to be. Now, instead of last year, turning double plays is a more seamless task, and you can throw the ball to first to the pitcher on the run. These were major problems with the last one in my opinion. The main thing that they did'nt fix was all of the foul outs. It simply does not happen THAT much in real life. The main thing is this: If you're looking for THE best baseball sim out there for Xbox, then this it it. It's not perfect, but neither is Madden, or Tiger Woods etc. Oh and BTW, Of course the Yankee fan thought Manny Ramirez is overrated in the game."
2,Not Compatible with 360,"First off, this is the best baseball game I have ever played. Unfortunately, Microsoft has made it incompatible with the XBox 360 console. Earlier MVP games ('03 and '04) are apparently compatible, but 2005 is not. Buyer beware, if you are planning on playing this game on a 360, you will be disappointed."
2,What a step back,"I just got my new MVP 2005 shipped... man, I was really dissapointed.1. Hitter's eye was LOOKING GOOD, but it's like cheating, and I NEVER got struck out because of that stupid color thing on the ball and I scored my first game 19 in 6 innings with that.2. Good Graphic is the only reason that I didn't give it 1 star. But, the face map is bad. Matsui looked bad, and Victor Martinez, Coco Crisp and Jose Cruz Jr. looked all same to each other.3. Fielding is HELLA difficult. Just like last year4. Commentary are still bad, cheesy, late...5. Some guy's ratings were massed. Aramis Ramirez is too underrated. Manny Ramirez was too overrated in that Game.6. Only good thing was creative create-a-ballpark mode7. Not many cutscenesWell, I'm waiting for another ship order-MLB 2K5. I'll post my opinion with it"
5,The Best,"I received this book (and the Papa, Papa book) as a gift when my daughter was born. I read the books to her almost every day. The poem is absolutely delightful! Especially the last part -- I almost cry every time I read it (and I'm not generally sappy).Buy it!"
5,Wonderful book/ Great illustrations,I have been reading this book to my now 22 mo old since she was a newborn. It is her favorite and has gone with us to her numerous doc appointments/tests and procedures. I am so grateful that we have this book that I am here to buy another as ours is getting pretty worn from use. She asks for it every night along with her Five Monkeys book. It's very simple but there is a gentle cadence to the book that conveys love with every word. The illustrations are so sweet. You wll not be disappointed with this book.
1,Does not contain classic furniture,"This book was a total disappointment! I thought the book would actually contain classic country furniture plans. The plans included are obviously the author's version of classic country furniture, and definitely not my version of ""classic"" country furniture. The cover gives the wrong impression. Save your money!"
2,Cute shapes but badly made junk,"Thin tin, cookie dough sticks to it like no other cutters I have, and they rust. Because the dough sticks, I put them in a bowl of hot soapy water and around the edges of the top of the cutter (the rim) they all had rust starting to form in less than 2 hours."
2,Too Small,"I'm pretty disappointed with these cutters. They are way too small, the seahorse is so skinny I'm not even sure a cookie would cook properly. The shapes are pretty poor as well...the seagull and fish are pretty ok...but the others are pretty boring, one of the animals is really odd, I think it's a manatee? maybe an otter?i wouldn't purchase these again."
3,"Cute, but they rust","Cute cutters, but they're thin and rust if they're not completely dried after washing. Plus, the barcode stickers are on each individual cutter and are a pain to remove."
4,1981 summer big souvenir,very good pop rock music with a good elctric guitar sound. It remember me very good holliday in french alpes mountain in 1981
3,an eighties pop treat you can listen to agian and agian,"babe, is the best cut from this recording with all the other tracks perhaps lacking in superhit potential, but very good numbers. this album as i first heard it back in 1980,is well produced only now being heard on compact disk format making it a real listening treat all over agian."
5,COOOOOOOOL GOOOOOOOOOOAL!!!!,"This game is the best. It gives you the feeling of playing soccer outside of stadiums or fields. Instead, you will play in parks on blacktops, and in the alleys. It gives you the authentic feeling of how peolpe in countries like Brazil, France, Spain, England, and many other countries play when they do not have alot of space. GO GET IT TODAY ANDSCORE A GOAL WITH FIFA STREET."
3,It only get's better from here.,I have know as many others have that this is how we will watch TV in the future. The picture looks good and of course it depends on your computer and connection speed but the lapse between audio and video is still not quite there. You guys are doing a great job / keep it up.
5,"Sweet unit, best sound for the buck !","Got the Canadian version KS3102-2 from a membership warehouse store and it was highly recommended by the staffs there even over some Japanese systems. The biggest surprise was the wonderful sound, which at 300w is more than enough for a home setup, as I found now. The system makes movie watching very enjoyable and if I close my eyes, it feels just like I am at the theater. In my option, the price is worth the sound system alone (very powerful amp, great sub and speakers for the size) and the progressive scan DVD player is just a Huge plus. The dvd playing is smooth even for dvds/vcds that I had problems with my new-ish Panasonic. Simply, a very amazing and user-friendly system that I hope people weren't discouraged by the Koss label."
5,Big bang for your buck,"This product is a great value. I watched X-Men 2 last night and the sound was incredible. It is easy to install, but if you have a cable box be sure to use the directions came with the cable box because the directions that come with the unit are poor (just a diagram that shows EVERY type of configuration on one page). Also, the Sub-Woofer comes with an annoying sticker on it that took an hour to get off. I highly recommend this unit for sound quality and price."
1,DO NOT BUY KOSS,"Go to any electronics store and you'll hear them say, ""Do not buy Koss"". While some review site that one person thinks is ""THE authority"" say it's quality, review sites do not use the product beyond an initial test. I've owned mine for three months, and originally, I thought I got quite a steal. Now the thing is dead, nothing more than awkward paperweight.Whatever you do, do yourself a favor, save up an extra month or two and buy a quality sound system. Do some research even beyond this site and you will find that Koss is a huge waste of your money."
2,Sound,"I have set up my new system this week and unfortunately there must be a defect in the amplifier. The unit is not putting out 300 watts, my tv's 10x2 watts sound better!!!!"
3,Help,Hey was looking at this system because of the price and the tech specs for the price. I wanted to hook it up to my desktop computer so I don't really care if the dvd player busts. Does anyone know if the receiver will still take sound input using a Y-cable to the receiver? thanks
1,Customer Service????,"After 25, yes 25 calls to what Koss calls Customer Service, I finally got somewhere. They sent me a shipping label to return the 2nd, yes 2nd defective DVD player back to them for a REFUND, not an exchange.I am no longer interested in ANY Koss product at ANY price based on my experience. More than once I had to ask their ""tech support"" for someone else as I could not understand what they were saying thru the heavy accent. India was where I was calling all this time. Finally got someone I could understand when I insisted on a refund."
1,bad,"this thing is junk!!dvd player could not read any discs!!sound is not that good!!take my advice,buy a SONY,PANASONIC,ETC.!!DONT BUY THIS KOSS JUNK!!"
3,a real trooper with a little biddie lifespan,"This mini mouse lasted almost 7 months. From my research, that's average but considering the lightweight construction and small size needed for the portability it provides, PLUS the cheap prices, its lifespan has to suffer. However, while it is working, this mouse is a pleasure to have. Small, lightweight, easy to pack and full features. I'm ordering another one just like it. The cord will jam on you in its retractor mechinism if you rush it. I can see where that may be a breaking point in the wire - getting a habit of jerking the ends of the wire to retract the cord. But over all, it's a very average mousie."
2,stopped working after 8 months,"I was happy with the mouse until it stopped working yesterday (device no longer recognized). I suspect that one or some of the wires inside of the cable must've broken. This was an occasional use mouse and was never (in my estimation) abused so I'm a little disappointed that I didn't get a year's use out of it. On the other hand the price was pretty low, so low that it's not worth trying to get warranty service/replacement.I'm going to try a wireless portable mouse next...."
5,Great for laptop.,Great small mouse. I use it with my laptop. I can't seem to get used to the thing that came on the laptop.
3,"It's adequate, but not as small as I'd expected. Also, right click doesn't work well",It's not as small or as good as the one I had before. Right click doesn't perform well so I'm not that pleased with it.
3,Works great while it remains intact,I really was impressed with the ease of use of this little mouse but after just a few months of pretty moderate use the top plastic plate popped off and although I could piece it back together it never worked correctly again.
3,I suggest you get another one,"This mouse died on me today, after owning it for two year.Pros:. size and weight. cuteCons:. durability. the pointer would sometimes moves itself on my screen while the mouse was immobileI am obviously buying another mini mouse since I cannot go back to a regular mouse (mini is better for wrist). I used to have a Toshiba and it lasted forever."
4,One tough mouse,"I bought this mouse in June of 2009, so I've been using it for over a year now and it's held up remarkably. At first I was very careful with it; I'd put it in the velvet pouch and tuck it in a safe pocket inside my briefcase. Now I just throw it in there and often chuck books, binders, and my laptop right on top of it. This mouse can take a beating!It's small, cute, durable, and easy to use. My only complaint is that the retractable cord is touchy. Sometimes it gets twisted and stuck, and I have to futz with it to get it to retract all the way. But then the retractable cords on my iron and vacuum are also a pain, so maybe that's just the nature of the beast."
4,Worked well but broke in a year,I bought 2 of these based on the reviews that they stop working. But the price is so good it is worth it. It worked well for a year before it stopped working - responsive and easy to carry with you.
5,good purchase,"who wants a long mouse cord hanging over the side of a desk, lap? this is the best answer. And you wonder about the size? In this case, smaller is better."
1,defective,the mouse did not work properly. It constantly jammed and would not retract. when I tried to retract it the wiring broke from the mouse itself. I would like another mouse but do not know how I can get another one from this company. I only had the mouse for less than one month. Please help me resolve this matter. I have had retractable mice before and never had this problem. I am not sure if I would purchase a mouse from this company again.eleighsa Scriven
2,flimsy,cute but lasted only 10 weeks or about 4 times that I used it during this period..the wire stopped coming in and out..of course my return period already expired...basically another donation to Chinese economy!
5,Perfect for small spaces,"So far I love the mouse. It's really small, but most importantly - there is no bulky wire (or batteries) to worry about. Keeps the counter where we use our laptop a lot neater."
3,Smallish mouse but scroll wheel didn't work,"Seemed like a pretty decent mouse, though a little larger (length and height) than the ""Hewlett Packard PF725A USB Ultra Mini Mouse with retractable Cord"", which I prefer. Unfortunately, the scroll wheel didn't work for me and I had to return it."
4,Not Bad,"Purchased this Mini Mouse to go with my Acer Aspire One Notebook. Color matches almost exact. It's a little jumpy but, for the price it can't be beat. Don't think it would be a comfortable use for someone with large hands. I've found nothing wrong with it and I am getting good use from it."
2,broke after one week.,"cutting to the chase- the scroll wheel did not work after a few days of use. I sent it back for a refund.two stars because when it worked, it was awesome. I needed very little movement to reach the extremities of the screen. The problem (as mentioned) was the wheel. The mouse itself was very light and very cheap feeling. I would suggest going for one of the 8 dollar mini mice vs. this $15 one.ohh... and the case is garbage also. there wasn't anything redeeming about it so don't let it sway you in your purchase decision.****update****i returned it for a refund. amazon.com has an awesome policy."
4,Good Little Mouse,"I got this mouse to replace a mini that I had for my laptop. Easy to use; setup involves simply plugging it into the USB port, Windows takes care of the rest. 800 dpi resolution is very sensitive and gives quick movement. The ergonomic feel is quite good and the mouse is durable."
3,Sometimes a little awkward,"Have been using this mini mouse for about a month now. I bought it for my work laptop because my wireless mouse kept running out of battery charge. It fits into my laptop case well and it looks good. I have a Toshiba mini mouse for my home system that I have been using for about 6 months which has been working out well. With the IOGear mini mouse, there are times when the mouse just doesn't seem to fit my hand - it is slightly narrower than the Toshiba and it seems to force my fore finger further out - making it harder to click the mouse buttons. It maybe a matter of getting used to the new mouse, but these are my observations thus far. Other than that, the mouse works well and the wheel is great."
2,cute but poor quality,"the left-click button (kind of important) is sticking/not always working already, and i just bought this mouse 2 months ago.i use it every time i am on my laptop because the dell touchpad broke and i couldn't afford the time to ship it out for service. so maybe it would be ok if you only use the mouse occasionally. but i doubt it.it's kind of light and plastic-y and a little too skinny (not wide enough) to feel really comfortable. (i only use mini mouses because they're more convenient to carry around, and i've never really felt this way until i got this one, which is less round and more rectangular/narrow than others of a more standard shape.)"
3,It lasted a while,"This mouse lasted me a while but I stopped using it when the wire started becoming unattached from the USB plug. This is a good product if you are looking for a small mouse and if you take care of it, but beware, the wire is quit thin and can be damaged or pulled out of the USB plug if you are not careful."
1,Junk,"This item broke within two months. I'd give it zero stars if I could. >:(It's this kind of situation that makes me think about using Amazon less, since ""the window for returns"" is over. If I'd bought this from a local store I'd have 90 days, and even after that I could make myself a hairy nuisance and get a replacement at least. This is the second time a piece of IOGEAR equipment failed on me within weeks."
1,Less than a year of use,"Unfortunately this mouse lasted only about 6 months or so. It did work well while it lasted, but that wasn't very long. Wouldn't buy again."
3,Works nicely,"Pretty cool little retractible cable and nice styling, however the scroll wheel works the opposite direction from every other mouse I've used."
1,Cheap,"Pros: Compact, good for laptopCons: Stopped working after three months!Cheap build quality. I would not buy again. Look elsewhere."
2,Disappointed,This mouse had a nonfunctioning right clicker. Scroll toggle and left clicker worked. Iogear tech. support recommended I return it to Amazon.
3,"Nice, but doesn't last long","This is a nice little mouse to keep in your laptop case for travel. However, it's very fragile. I went through 6 of these already in the last couple of years (I got them from work). They keep getting a open connection where the cable meets the mouse."
1,Not worth the money,"I ordered this mini mouse to keep in my laptop bag. I used it less than a half dozen times before it fell apart. Since I don't take my laptop home from the office on a regular basis, the mouse was not even removed from the bag more than 6 times. Don't waste your money. It was too late for me to return this product, but I would never buy another one."
2,Dont waste your money on this!,"I bought this mouse because it is smaller in design and my 3 yr old granddaughter has trouble using a regular mouse because it is too cumbersome for her to move the mouse and click simultaneously. We are trying to get her used to using a computer by setting her up with smaller items she can manipulate to do it herself. Otherwise we have to help when she is playing her Kindergarten game or reader rabbit series. This mouse broke within less than 20 mins of her using it, the wires fell out right where they go into the mouse. I bought a Belkin pink mini-mouse on here for me (cost a little more)but I let her have it. She has used it for few days now and it has not failed at all..."
2,Not working well,"Bought it a few months ago based on good reviews, but not working well for me. First found it did not point precisely, and also sometimes required multiple clicks. Since last month, it started to show connection problems, and this month it quit working a few times. Does not worth return but will not recommend."
2,"Doesn't work on ""smooth"" surfices, didn't last","This mouse just has died on me - lasted around a year and I didn't really use it a whole lot. The mouse would be fine - I especially liked the retractable cord feature. However, it barely worked on my dining table or any other smooth surface. I guess it was too sensitive. I always had to put a piece of paper under the mouse to get it going. But durability proved to be the biggest flaw - I need to look for a new mouse now..."
1,IOGEAR Mini Mouse,Very disappointed in this product. Requires a real push to click and one of the two I bought is already not functioning after only one month.
1,fell apart after about 3 uses,"Thought it was great when I first used it, as it was nice for travel. However, it fell apart into several pieces after about 3 uses."
2,P.O.S.,"Mouse didn't work at first, after many tries and thinking of returning it I decided to through it against the wall and now it works great. Gave it 2 stars because it is durable and it did start working after taking a beating. P.S. all this is true."
3,Find something with a more solid feel.,"The left and right click portion of the mouse are loose and do not have a solid feel. Right clicking lifts the portion of the plastic covering the left click side. The mouse is functional, but appears that it is about to break apart at any moment. The wheel is a little oversized. Functional but not worth the price for this quality. Take your time when ordering. Better to find something else and don't become annoyed. I'd like to return it but will probably give it away and buy something else.IOGEAR USB Optical Mini Mouse 800 (GME222A)"
3,Not bad...a little awkward.,"In general, this mouse works well. The retractable cable works well, but the spool in the middle of the cable is kind of awkward- its weight makes it tough to set the mous down without it dragging it off the table. Also, the mouse itself is pretty tiny. Big hands will get tired using it quickly. Finally, the track wheel is pretty inconsient. If you spin it too fast it stops responding sometimes, and it seems like if you use it a lot it stops responding sometimes. It works, but it's a little disappointing so far overall."
2,"Worked well at first, but not durable. Not recommended.","Nice mouse, if it had any durability, but mine started acting sporatically just a few months after purchase. Sometimes the left mouse button wouldn't work. Contacted Iomega Customer Service, who would have replaced it, if I paid to ship it back, and filled out way too much paperwork. Today, 14 months after purchase, the mouse just stopped working altogether. A pretty poor value."
3,the fall of the roman empire,"Good battle scenes. Partially historically inaccurate. Not enough of this movie was given to Sophia Loren. The story had to much didication to the royals, and not enough to the citizens and soldiers of the empire. the pagentry was barely acceptable."
2,Truly a Spectacle,"There are three major problems with this movie. First, the movie is truly boring. I have never been able to sit through this without falling asleep. It makes El Cid look hyperactive. You never really care what happens to these characters. Second, Sophia Loren. She never looks less than glamourous and perfect no matter how dirty the surroundings. Every hair is always in place, makeup perfect, and her gowns (she never wears ""clothes"") look like something from Paris in the 1960's and are always clean and ironed. Ridiculous. Third, Samuel Bronston. He had a knack for making long and static movies. Sometimes shorter is better."
2,The Fall of the Bronston Empire,"This bloated, overlong epic marked the virtual end of multi-million dollar spectacular movies produced in the late fifties and early sixties. Boasting the largest budget ever at the time, it also grossed the least amount of money for this sort of film (a mere $500K). Its screenwriter, Philip Yordan, once told me that after this movie ""the banks closed their doors whenever they saw Sam Bronston coming."" Despite its impressive cast, the film is downright dreary. How did such a huge film on such a fascinating subject go so terribly wrong? It's too bad, really, because I miss this kind of spectacle with thousands of ""live"" extras and fabulous, rousing music scores."
1,Elongated.,"'Fall of the Roman Empire' is vastly superior to its remake, 'Gladiator', but that's not saying much. Its advantages include genuine locations and rich art design over bland CGI; elements of perversion culled from Greek tragedy and Wagner; sly moments of directorial humour at the sheer lumbering witlessness of the whole enterprise; and an allegory for an America cracking up over Vietnam, civil rights, the 1960s. Besides that, it's just like every other historical epic you've ever seen, except longer and less camp."
3,Don't waste your time just buy Gladiator,"This film brought about the demise of Roman epics in hollywood.After the success of movies such as Ben-Hur, this movie was made inhopes of latching on to other's success. A horrible failure..do no buythis movie"
4,DVD/ Fall of the Roman Empire,"I am glad I purchased this movie, I enjoyed it very much. I had no problem in ordering this from Amazon.com and I am pleased with their handling of shipping and getting my item to me in a timely matter. Thank you"
2,"Swords, sandalls and longing looks.","Long and lumbering it takes awhile for anything to actually happen. I found the award winning music score to be intrusive. Stephen Boyd and Sofia Loren are pleasant to look at, but beneath that surface there's not much there. Boyd was an interesting overlooked actor, type-cast after his turn in Ben-Hur,it would have been interesting to have seen him as Antony in ""Cleopatra"". Alec Guiness and James Mason were outstanding and Christopher Plummer delightfully chews the oppulant scenery as the mad/bad emperor Commodus. The lavish sets and crowds were truly awe inspired. Unlike the computor generated effects of Gladiator, they actually built the sets and populated them with real people."
2,It's okay,It's not that good to me and is kind of sick. It is better than nothing but I would buy Cleopatra instead.
2,unwatchable,"nothing on the packaging that says its REGION 2, and since I don't have an all region player no good to me. However in the description of it, it does mention it, but it should have been in bolder print"
1,NOT a Region A/1 BluRay so cannot watch it,"Bought this as a group recommendation by Amazon without checking the Region code. In essence my mistake but then the other 2 were USA region BluRays so I had no reason to look closely. Sad too because I liked this movie when I saw it years ago and wanted to watch it in comparison with Gladiator. The Package itself also does not seem to mention Region B/2 unless it's in fine print that is so small I'm not seeing it. If you do not have a multi region player you should avoid this one.Also I did read where Amazon says they only sell USA BluRays at Amazon.com, apparently this isn't completely true, another reason I didn't check closely"
1,A GIANT YAWN,"I saw this film on the giant 70mm screen when it was first released.It was one of the most tedious experiences I had encountered in a cinema at the time.The passing years,and a recent viewing,have not improved the film's standing with me."
1,Worst Film Ever,"This has to one of the worst films ever made. The problem is that you keep watching the movie with the hopes that it will get better. It never does. I am a great fan of Sophia Loren and I am surprised that she agreed to participate in such a farce. The movie's concept had such potential, but fails miserably. The battle scenes are truly pathetic, compared to movies made during that time frame. You shouldn't waste your time and certainly not your money on this film."
4,Fall of the Roman Empire (1964),"Fans of the blockbuster hit GLADIATOR will find this film somewhat familiar as it deals with the same factual characters and events. Sophia Loren and Stephen Boyd provide attractive window-dressing as the starcrossed lovers, but the real stars are Alec Guiness, James Mason and especially Christopher Plummer whose portrayal of the evil emperor Commodous rivals the Oscar caliber work of Joaquin Phoenix in the more recent epic. Lush 70mm photography on massive sets should make this an exceptional title to add to your classics library on DVD."
5,History Rolls On,A good video to understand the history of the Roman Empire. This video was instrumental in helping my child understand the history of what happened during this era.
3,The Fall of the Roman Empire,"I was never much on the CGI-laden GLADIATOR, but I didn't realize until now that it's a remake of this. The 1st half is filled w/ good scenes: an unnecessary but still thrilling BEN-HUR-ish chariot race/fight, this time through a forest, a battle w/ Vandals, and a funeral for the murdered emperor during a snow storm. After all this on the German frontier, we go back to Rome and the absolutely astounding Roman Forum, still the largest set ever built. Unfortunately the 2nd half is bogged down w/ a murky plot that tries to cover too much ground. Even at 3 hours, the film feels choppy and heavily edited. Christopher Plummer, in his 1st big screen role, is a wonderfully fruity Commodus, but Stephen Boyd is a dispiriting lump as the hero. Some in-fashion Brit actor would have been a much better choice, Albert Finney perhaps? 6/10"
3,The Fall of the Roman Empire Movie,"In my opinion, Dimitri Tiomkin's musical score for The Fall of The Roman Empire is too modern and not quite appropriate for this epic film. Don't take me wrong, Dimitri Tiomkin is one of my favorite film composers; however, I'm not particularly happy with this film's musical score. Because of its score, I'll have a hard time to watch this film again for a long time. I think when a score is not quite appropriate, the quality of even a good film diminishes greatly. I believe if Miklos Rozsa had scored this film, it would've been a much more watchable film."
4,a good love story,Boy sees girl...girl sees boy. Girl is the daughter of a caesar. Lots of fighting. Sad looks. Betrayal. Lots of theatrical tension . Wrong guy wins for most of the movie. Drama galore. I love the movie. If you like huge spectacular old fashioned Hollywood movies you will love this one. sophia at her very most beautiful
2,Far From an Epic Epic,"Mounting this sweeping saga may have been a logistical triumph, but it makes for a soggy movie. Dire dialogue, incorporating great slabs of expository speechifying that would be laughable if it weren't so dull -- Roman princes and pro-consuls giving each other redundant history lessons on the glory of Rome (for the edification, of course, of the audience) -- characters that were Hollywood cliches for toga epics by 1964, and legions endlessly prancing around on horseback all conspire to emphasize Sophia Loren's sullen demeanor. Maybe in her youth, and in her native language, she was a competent actor, but English dialogue and the burden of being one of the great beauties of the age seem consistently to have reduced her to displaying the emotional range of a bad case of constipation."
3,Not crazy about it,"It's over the top, trying too hard to be epic. First of all, the score being much louder than the actors is very annoying. The scenes of troops heading to each destination are far too long and get extremely monotonous. After seeing '300' I can't help but feel the fight scenes here are boring. But as one of the most expensive movies ever made, the sets and cinematography are impressive, and all the special features are very interesting. Its historical aspect is worth the attention and C.Plummer is the amazing saving grace of the film."
2,50% History and 50% Fiction,"The film was well made - production wise, but the story seemed a bit too contrived for me. I was also bothered by the fact that the film is supposed to be telling the story about an important historical event and Hollywood chose to fictionalize the story. One of the two primary characters upon which the story is built is a complete fabrication. I think historical stories in film should follow the actual events."
5,Widescreen fans please note...,"...you can obtain a fairly high quality widescreen DVD edition of this film from Amazon France's marketplace sellers. You can choose to watch in English, the only drawback being that the accompanying French subtitles can't be erased. However, when you see the price, even with postage, you won't want to complain!"
1,A region B blu-ray only. WILL NOT PLAY ON U.S. PLAYERS,"OOPS!The disc gets one star, the movie gets five stars. I bought the ""Zulu"" import blu-ray and it was beautiful so took a chance on this blu ray. This blu-ray though will not play on U.S players but only on region B players. This is a great movie and I hope it does come out on blu-ray eventually. This would be a great buy if it would play. Disc 2 has 2 and 1/2 hours of extra features that I would have loved to have seen."
3,It's ok,Just received this movie in the mail. It's ok. There is a lot more action than there is dialogue. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
5,Great Stuff,"I use it for gripping guitar picks and it does the trick nicely. It keeps the pick from sliding through your fingers and from being dropped while playing. It smells somewhat piney, and has the waxen consistency of chap-stick; it comes in a very small container, but just using very little of it is all you need. Fortunately it washes off fairly easily afterward."
2,Sticky Stuff,"I wonder now what I expected from this purchase. Its a small jar of sticky stuff. It reminds of the time I stuffed a bunch of Peppermint Pattys in my gig bag and they melted all over my picks. I don't remember once saying to myself ""I have a much better grip on these picks now"". Like that, this product just feels messy like I need to wash it off. If I have to play Pollyanna, I should mention it smells nice."
5,Works great!,"Love this stuff. GS gives you the perfect amount of tac on your hands without being overly sticky. Also doesn't leave your hands black afterwards. Give your hands a break, buy Gorilla Snot!"
3,It's pine tar?,"Just like the pine tar that oozes out of my pine trees and pressure treated deck....It works, but I could get it for free! Anyway, it smells good...like a Carolina pine forest."
4,Very enjoyable,"I remember an old tag line for a copy of The Martian Chronicles I had indicating that there was no writer quite like Ray Bradbury and that still holds true today. While certainly not in the upper echelon of his past classics, A Graveyard for Lunatics is certainly a page turner that keeps hold of your interest from start to finish. Bradbury uses Hollywood as a vessel for the much larger themes of death, fame, and religion and wraps it in a murder mystery. Unfortunately, and the reason I withhold a star, is that it becomes a little too easy to figure out a huge piece of the puzzle and knowing or assuming that as you read takes something away from the suspense. That being said, the plot is still very tightly constructed and the characters are, for the most part, very well drawn. A nice piece of work from the master."
3,"Charmed, I'm Sure","It's a sweet and simple fact of life: some people will like it, and some people will not. However, many pros and cons of this mystery novel are defiant and absolute. This novel contains well developed, attractive characters complete with their own pet peeves and since of humor. Also, there are remarkable philosophical questions with ample room for discussion and debate such as the ""going home again"" theme and the symbolism of the ""another tale of two cities"" within one city. However, some unappealing aspects of this novel included the fact it wasn't that much of a mystery. The clues, hints, and evidence given by Bradbury were obvious gestures to the truth and conclusion of the story. Other minor negative details such as one or two lacking characters and poor transitions withheld two stars from this mystery book. Otherwise, many compliments and much respect to Ray Bradbury. Charmed, I'm sure."
4,Pure Whimsy,"Bradbury can be whimsical -- and even silly -- at times. He has a bent for humor, and it is apparent in this book. Undoubtedly it is based on his movie script-writing experiences and his work with his friend, Ray Harryhausen. Yet, overall, it failed to absorb my attention as much as his other, more sinister (noir) works. It's a nice addition to your library if you are a dyed-in-the-wool Bradbury fan. I passed my copy along to someone after reding it, as I also did with ""Let's All Kill Constance,"" a title related to this one."
4,Impressive,"A very impressive story, it does raise a lot of questions, certainly worth reading. A must read for everyone interested in NDE's."
1,This is horrendous....,"I bought this book by pure chance and God, was this awful.... This is exactly the stuff that gives the NDE research bad name. THis woman claims to have had 3 successive NDE's, neither confirmed nor verified; writes a book about them, incoherent, overly emotional, almost hysterical, corny and anything but credible. Makes a wild and long novel out of those supposed NDE's, ""revealing the secrets of the creation of the Universe"", and, after that, starts shooting out book after book on her pseudo-scientific ""research"", on the one hand, and on the ""Truth about God and the Universe"" on the other. This woman is an aberration for serious NDE research and an insult to the heroic work of real scientists like R. Moody, P. van Lommel, Chris Carter, J. Long, E. Alexander, M. Sabom, P. Fenwick, Jean-Jacques Charbonier, etc. Stay away from anything by that fraud."
1,Bad book.,"I'm not the biggest fan in the world of Cindy Crawford, but I thought that perhaps someone who spends all her waking hours thinking about her looks and telling us all how beautiful she is would have something of interest to say. Guess what, she doesn't?"
3,O-kay beauty book,"I received this book for Christmas and really wish I would have received something else. She gives you some helpful knowledge, but there are better beauty books out there to spend your money on!"
2,Cindy Crawford's Basic Face really is BASIC,"Although I found a few pointers, more then anything I read things I already knew about. Such as drinking plenty of water and washing your face...puh-lease, if you're a woman you know this by instinct.Don't expect any real secrets of the trade, it basically covers everything a teenage girl should know when starting to wear makeup. A sheer waste of money and time."
2,I'm not too inmpressed!,"I took the book out of the library. That's all I have to say. I've read many beauty books and yes Cindy Crawford is a beautiful person, but I found her book plain and boring. There were no tips in there that I didn't already know about, and there was little pictures and those that were there were of Cindy! Come on, I want to see other peolpe too! I think it's true when they say ""Don't judge a book by it's cover!"" I certainly did, and boy was I ever wrong. Here are two books that are more useful and informative!Tyra Bank's book- a definate 5 stars!Kevin Aucoin's book- making faces- there's nothing better!"
4,How to apply your makeup,Basic Face taught me how to apply my makeup the correctly and gave me backround information about Cindy Crawford.
4,How to apply Makeup,Good book for those who are not familiar with applying makeup. Good basic information. Not for the makeup sophisticate.
2,LOOK ELSEWHERE!,"I BEGGED FOR THIS BOOK FOR CHRISTMAS. I LOVE CINDY CRAWFORD AND I THINK SHE'S LOVELY, BUT SHE SHOULD STICK TO THE RUNWAY. THIS BOOK WAS A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY. THE BEST THING ABOUT THE BOOK IS THAT IT IS SPIRAL BOUND, THE DRAWBACK IS I NEVER NEEDED TO LEAVE IT OPEN. WHEN SHE WROTE BASIC, SHE WAS NOT KIDDING. IF YOU HAVE NEVER WORN ANY MAKEUP BEFORE THIS MAY HELP, OTHER THAN THAT LOOK TO A KEVYN AUCOIN BOOK."
2,"Nothing special about this book, except the price !",Mediocre at best. Any book of similar content which is less expensive would do the trick. This book as well as the A+ Core has too many typographical errors and sentences missing words. A novice could get very confused trying to decipher some of the errors.
3,A Survey of Poetic Form in the History of English Poetry,"Schmidt's boldness is nearly unmatched among literary critics. For this reason alone, his book, Lives of the Poets, is a stimulating read. Of course, there are problems with the book. He spends nearly a third of his book on the last fifty years, after swiftly encompassing the rest of English poetical history in the first two thirds. A few glaring omissions are almost unforgivable, such as James Merrill and A.R. Ammons. One must remember, however, that Schmidt is a publisher by trade, and not really a literary critic. Even Samuel Johnson wrote about bad poets, though it may have been his advisors who pushed for such a shift of emphasis. In the end, one is often refreshed and enlightened by this book."
4,Amazing,I was lucky enough to hear this cd being played at a bar in between band sets and I was amazed. I bought it the next day and haven't stopped listening to it yet. Too bad the guitarist is no longer alive as I would have loved to see this band perform live! The music is fresh and very dark at times. Just close your eyes and listen
2,This book is probably worth having in your collection.,This book does have some good information some pretty good photography as well showing health problems to look for as well as some very beautiful healthy birds. There is some good information on diseases well worth reading. It is however rather s short book for the price.The book does need a good editor for the next time it is published. The reader will find the same sentence pasted into the text over and over I would guess as the result of abuse of a word processor.
4,great little unit for the money but harder to install than advertized,"the rs1100 is a great buy, but you get what you pay for. its more complicated than advertized to install on some vehicles. but all in all its a great little unit for the price, and it sure beats being out in the cold."
3,Issues,"Good product. Schematics on the website for my vehicle (2000 Nissan Altima) were incorrect so I had to ad lib. I did get it to work but it would grind when turning the key with the engine already running. Instructions make no mention of an anti-grind relay or how to wire one. After a short google search I found the needed information and wired in my own anti-grind relay. Works good now, wife loves it."
4,Works,"I bought this over a year ago and its still working. Although i think the battery is almost done. If you wire it correctly this will work just as intended. The remote has a nice fancy rubber feel out of the box however this is just a thin coat of rubber that will wear away in a couple months. Not a big deal, im just happy its never stopped working for me. Only thing that annoys me is the button arrangement on the remote. I know the small button is for both unlock and lock, but everyone else seems to think the big button with the key on it is unlock (cant blame them). This means my car stalls sometimes, (i wired it in a manual). By the way if you are doing this in a manual, be very careful of wether you leave the car in gear. I never do so it doesnt bother me."
4,Difficult but good.,"Let me start by saying that I used to work as a mechanic and am very familiar with automotive wiring. That being said this install still proved to be difficult and not for the faint of heart wishing for a quick easy install. I purchased this for my wife's 2004 Ford Expedition about a year ago. The install was difficult but not overly painful. Once installed the unit worked fantastic. I have never had some of the problems that other reviewer claim to have and judging by some of the comments I might be inclined to suspect a bad install for the problems in other reviews. I have been inside of buildings hundreds of feet away from our vehicle, hit the start button on the remote when I go outside...my vehicle is running! I like this product so much that I have decided to purchase another one for my vehicle (a 99 Isuzu Trooper)."
4,Installing a remote start...not that hard.,"I installed this remote start into a 1994 GMC 3500 dump truck. The truck originally had no power door locks or windows and I recently installed a power door lock system. (Which I purchased on Amazon...see my other reveiw.) The main reason I installed the remote start was for the keyless entry feature.Although this installation was pretty straight foward, you need some mechanical/electrical experience. It should not be attempted by a complete novice.The included directions and DVD were very complete and easy to understand and follow. I was able to attach the remote start to my power door lock module simply and it works great. The remote start has never failed to start the engine. Very nice to have a warm truck when parked outside in the winter.I've been using it for about 2 months now and for the money, it can't be beat."
4,"Worked as what I want, but not so easy to set it up","Got two of them 2 month ago and set it up through a whole day. It really took me some time to figure out the right wire, because the diagram on their website is not so accurate for one of my car.(for 1996 avalon, the color of the wire for the door is not right). But once I set it up, it worked perfectly. I can control it at about 100 feet away from it. although it's not 400 feet, it is good enough. I gave it 4 stars only because it is not as easy as what I thought to set it up, but maybe it is different in your case, depends on how good you are at electrics. :-)"
4,"Works well, a little difficult to install","Bought this for my son's 05 Corolla. Buying the wiring harness easily cut the install time in half. Make sure to check Bulldog's web site to see if they have vehicle specific instructions for your car. Even with pictures from the web site, took longer than anticipated to install.Got the damn thing working, only to quit. Began re-checking all the wiring. Put a paperclip to bypass the fuse and everything worked. Blew two of the supplied fuses.Once installed, we're pleased with the functionality."
1,Used item,"I received an item that had obviously been removed form another vehicle, stuck in a box, and mailed. I could still see the splices above where the wires were cut. Asked for a refund, no replacement. Wouldn't recommend to anyone."
1,Gigantic Mess,"I asked my brother-in-law, who is a certified mechanic, to help me install this. After he read through the instructions he told me it would be too big of a job for him and that he couldn't do it. I called around a few auto shops and asked if they could and they were so quick to tell me no when I mentioned it was Bulldog Security... like it's the plague. I can only imagine why. Now I'm stuck with a useless product since there's no way I'm capable of trying to install this myself. I guess this is what you get for trying to buy cheap."
2,I am returning it,"while this product may be very good, we'll never know. We contacted 3 people in town who could install the starter, the first would not install this one, he would install the one he offers for $350. The second one said that he took more of these out, than he installed because they have been known to screw up the mother boards in the vehicles. The third guy said he would install it, 5 hours at $65.00 per hour but not guarantee anything because they have been known to screw up the vehicle once they are installed. Sat ""on hold"" with manufacturer for 20 minutes and never got anybody who knew any thing."
1,do not buy!!!,I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE PRODUCT BUT DO NOT BUY FROM NORTHERN TOLL + EQUIPMENT THE ONE YOU GET IS NOT A BULLDOG IT IS A PRESTIGE AND WHEN YOU CALL THEM ABOUT IT THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE THE SAME THING AND THEY ARE NOT!
1,not every model listed,"My 06 trailblazer had alot of extra notes, came down to it the person i hire said he couldn't do it with risking my computer."
2,Missing Wiring Harness,"The unit seems like pretty good quality, but i have not been able to install it yet as one of the three wiring harnesses was MISSING! Instead of three different harnesses, there were 2 identical ones. The other problem that i have with it is that the keys could be labeled better; there is a key on the top left and a lock on the top right, i just know that if i let somebody borrow the car, they'll end up pressing the key to unlock it and end up starting the car. Not a big deal, but the keys could have been maybe a little more thoughtfully labeled, like ""Start"" and ""Stop"", ""Lock"" and ""Unlock"" for example. Just my opinion. Other than that i guess it seems ok!"
2,Not as easy as advertised,It is completely 100% not as easy as advertised. splicing all the wires of my car just wasnt easy nor practical.
4,This is a must to have in the winter time,"Good product, the instruction doesn't included trouble shooting. I have to go online and look for Q&A.;But overall, good to have in the winter time. The signal range is kind of short not as description (400 feet).I am happy to have it."
1,ZERO STARS,"Complete crap works fine if your standing right next to the car. feels and looks cheap. shop around I found a viper for the same price, wish i would have ordered it first."
1,Customer support non-existent,"I ordered this item for my 2002 Ford Ranger Edge. Great price on Goldbox.The instructional dvd would NOT play. It was scratched.After opening, I realized I needed some extra items from bulldog to make this item work with my vehicle.I emailed them numerous times, and left them numerous voice mails. They never emailed or called back.I am sure this item works for some people, but I don't trust a company that can't back up their product by providing support."
2,Nice Deal,Even though the deal WAS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE ... Can't find anyone in our area to install it .. I wanted to surprise my husband for Christmas but low and behold here it is Vallentine's Day and still don't have a local installer ... Soooo Disappointed
3,RS 1000 semi easy,"System is easy to install once you have visited the bulldog website and obtained all the up to date documentation on the system for the type of remote starter you have. They have an up do date color code for the vehicle I have, so it was easy to locate wires.Had to visit web site to find an up do tade wire fix for my RS 1000 in a special not on the top of the web page. Took about 2.5 hours to hook up.Hint: Don't do this in the winter unless you have a heated garage!"
5,Love Letters in Song,"I got this book for my 90-something old father and we had a blast with it, since so much of this music is the music he grew up with and grew to love.As we read the chapters on the making of the music and the lives of the composers, song-writers, and song-makers, we sang these songs to each other.It's a fat book chock full of hither-to unknown facts, marvelous asides on how plugging a song was done before radio. . . how the grammaphone and technology changed the face of musical history.And, so many pictures! These alone are worth the cost of admission.--Janet Grace Riehl, author Sightlines: A Poet's Diary"
1,Boring,"Thought this movie was going to be good but when I saw it, I was sure disappointed, this movie was so boring I think the price is not worth it. If I could receive my money back, I would."
5,Unsung Brilliance,"The book, the movie and Harrison himself never quite got their full due. I can't add much to all the gushing reviews. It's an engineer's revenge fantasy, to solve the greatest problem of his or her era and overcome the stogey stonewalling of high-minded academics. From the book: Sir Isaac Newton himself couldn't accept a mechanical solution to what he thought should be a celestial solution. Move over genius, a humble watch-maker did it!"
2,Disappointed,"This movie contains two plot lines - one in the 17th century as a clockmaker tries to solve the problem on determining longitude, and the other a modern (50's) plot about a man trying to reconstruct the original devices made by the clockmaker and also put his own life together. I found the way the director cut from plot to plot distracting and made it hard to follow either plot. While I believe the story is close to historically correct, the jumping between plot line made the stories significantly less enjoyable for me - and I would skip this movie."
5,A wonderful fictionalized story of the Harrison saga,"I initially purchased this work for use with a 5th grade class doing an exploration of the problems surrounding the need for calculating longitude in early exploration and seagoing. My 5th grade class was riveted by excerpts from the story and always disappointed when we had to shut off the VCR to attend to the hands-on aspect of the project! They weren't alone as I have easily watched this work three times with pleasure. Based on the book by Dava Sobel, Longitude shows the typical A&E high quality stamp (particularly the network's talent for authentic sea and period pieces) by juxtaposing Rupert Gould's early 20th century restoration of the Harrison clocks with the actual story of Harrison's lifetime struggle for perfection and recognition. Both stories are compelling and the acting of high quality. A highly recommended series for private and academic collections."
4,Reprinted in Dixie Fried,"A few years before the events of ""Gone to Texas"", Cassidy meets a vampire with a slightly different attitude to undeath. A fun little romp, foreshadowing later events in the Preacher books. It's reprinted in its entirety in ""Dixie Fried""."
5,Great product,"Great product, I tested it with Kodak Easyshare Z612 and my wife's Z712 IS and it worked excellent in both cameras. You must to know a little bit about photography and also have talent to get that shot. It is a good product and takes little time to get familiarized with it."
4,Great Affect!,I really love how it blurs the background alot but you have to zoom in because theres a black border. But I love it!!
2,Not what I expected.,"I expected more of a difference in the zoom capabilities than what I have seen so far. There were no instructions with it at all and so I basically went with other reviews that I had read before I bought mine. It took forever the first time to get the threads on the converter to thread on to my camera, but it gets a little easier now each time. I guess I need more time to see how I really feel about it, but at this point I am not impressed at all and wish that I hadn't bought it."
2,Not a good telephoto lens,"I own the Kodak EasyShare Z1012, and I dislike this telephoto lens. You absolutely must have the camera on a tripod to get any kind of decently clear and focused shot, and even then it is not perfectly focused. I read mixed reviews on this lens and took a chance...and I don't like this product. I wish there were other choices of lens companies who make accessories for this camera, but unfortunately, as far as I know, this is it."
2,at least it's cheep,"i have the kodak 1012is and this is not a 2.2x lens. more like 1.2x. that is why i gave it a low score. false advertising. the example picture is completely false. using the automatic function of the camera and taking landscape shots, the lens is useless. i get a better picture with the stock lens. i would have rated it single star but the large lens does help in low light situations and works well with the hd video function of the camera.if you want a 2.2x lens for your 1012is camera, this is not for you"
1,Disappointed,I bought the opteka 2.2x HD2 Telephoto lens for my Kodak z1012 IS..I am terribly dissappointed in the product...I am glad I only spent $30 on it...it leaves a hazy look on photo's...I don't like it...I wouldn't recommend this product...but the macro lens is fantastic..that was well worth the money..
2,Disappointed.,"I was let down by this lens. I own a Kodak Z712 IS and I love the camera. This lens just doesn't do the job though. Sure, it improves your zoom, but that's about it. On the Opteka site it says that this lens actually IMPROVES picture quality. Wrong! First off, you need a tripod or your pictures will turn out fuzzy most of the time. Second, every pic I've taken looks like I took it through a window. Would you want to take pictures of subject in your yard from inside your house and through a closed window? Not me, and that's what my pictures look like. My camera's pictures come out much better without the lens. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I don't think so. I followed the directions. Too bad, because the lens sure looks good on my camera. I didn't give it one star because it does actually improve your zoom capabilities."
2,zoom lens,"The zoom lens looked good on the camera, and that was about it. You had to zoom all the way out to get the tunnel view off of the camera. If I would of been able to just attach the lens to the camera I think it would have worked just fine. The zoom was pretty good, can't take that away and pictures did come out good."
1,not happy this time,"I bought this machine 1 month ago and the pump has gone already, They want me to take it 70 miles away for warranty. So I just bought another pump online for 300.00 and fixed it myself. in the past with other equipment i have bought from them northern tool has always sent me the parts for warranty work but will not do that any more. Next purchase will be from a local dealer so I can get service."
5,Aircon/Fuel line disconnect tool....,Bought one of these sets of tools for disconnecting the air con lines on a 95 ford mustang GT so i could change the heater core. Tool fits round the back of the connection joint and with a bit of wiggling and some effort the pipes just popped off. Made a difficult job so much easier. Would recommend.
5,The Best Choice,"These tools are excellent. They have fit perfectly on all the various makes and sizes of AC and fuel disconnects I have tried. I imagine that they could get damaged or broken if used roughly or incorrectly, but just make sure they are the right size and seated correctly in the joint before applying force. I have used them on at least a dozen occasions so far, and none of them have any signs of wear yet."
3,It Worked,"I just used the tool to change a fuel filter on an '05 Explorer. It worked, but you need fingers of steel. Took about 5 tries to pop the connector using all my strength. It was my first time using so learning curve may have something to do with time and effort. Keep the filter in the bracket and attached to the frame. That gives you a little more leverage. Also,push fuel line toward filter while pushing the tool into the fuel coupling with your first two fingers (complicated right hand operation). That is what eventually worked for me."
5,Works Great,Easily removed two AC spring locks with these and they were not damaged at all in the process (which is common with the other variety of spring lock disconnect tools).
2,Terribly Disappointed,"For many years, I have been a BIG fan of the Images of America series. Each time I have moved to a new community, I have used these excellent books as my introduction to the history of my new home.Expecting a nice synopsis of the history of early Panama City, FL; what I got was a family photo album of the ""who's who"" of those elitist families who ran (and still run) Panama. There was virtually no coverage of the historical development; or the many house types in The Cove (yes, there were scattered house photos, but it was as if that were an afterthought).Sadly...... all this book did was dredge up my long buried personal memories on why I choose to leave that area, 40+ years ago."
5,Canadian/maritime/celtic espresso,"A phenominal mix of energy and music provides you with an entertaining and witty slice of Newfoundland.I just saw them live last week, and they were even more impressive than on CD. I was absolutely wired after leaving the concert - couldn't sit still!It's MORE than worth the extra dollars (Canadian or US) to get the Canadian release - for a fuller picture of what these fellows are capable of.They mentioned at the concert last week that they were headed for the recording studio again in the future. I'm waiting....."
3,choose another,This book is ok for emergency physicians... try Emergency and Primary Care of the Hand by ACEP press for more comprehensive and germaine coverage.
4,Phlebotomy textbook,"This was our required reading textbook for a community college phlebotomy class. It was a good guide for begginers, but if you'd want to become certified I'd reccomend getting supplemental material as well."
5,New,The book was in excellent condition (new)and the CD that comes with the book was in excellent condition too. The delivery time was fast. I would buy from this seller again.
3,what i needed,"I needed this book for a class. it was cheaper at Amazon than other places I had checked. The book had a layout that didn't seem to be the best, but the instructor just re arranged the chapters for us."
5,Beautiful dishes!,I bought this set for a friend this past Christmas. She had them on her wish list but had never actually seen the dishes in person. I was informed the next day that this set I gave her was not only her favorite gift of the season but she went home and ordered 3 more sets!
4,Great quality and beauty for the price!,"We've had these dishes 4 years now. We still love them. We've chipped a few and broken some but I blame clumsiness and a granite countertop for that. We've only put the serving dishes in the oven and they have held up beautifully. We will buy more as my clumsiness dwindles the supply, but I can't tell you how many times I have dropped these dishes expecting a crash or crack only to discover the piece is still wholely in tact and ready to be used for years to come. The only reason it is not a five star rating is that our plates do show some sign of use after 4 years. I have to look closely to see the wear, but it doesn't effect their function in the least."
5,Outcast of Redwall,"I think Outcast of redwall is the best book in the redwall series. All the characters are really intresting(especially Veil). Its got lots of action, is really funny, it has lots of different and intresting animals, it is very exciting, has lots of funny songs, hard riddles to solve, great food, intresting words, lots of different forts and castles,each type of animal has its own accent and personality."
4,"Good book, but not outstanding.","I am a big fan of all Redwall books, and overall this book came out to be good but not outstanding.Most of book 1 was about the badgerlord Sunflash the Mace and how he came to be, not really about the real outcast himself. In book 2 they did not really show the whole nature of the ferret Veil(who is the ""outcast"") it baiscly show veil being outcasted from Redwall and his old caretaker following him.The book could of gone longer to make it much better. It did not have much of an outstanding ending, the ending was way too short. Overall however, it was pretty good. In my personal opinion the best Redwall book is The Long Patrol."
5,A wonderful story!,"I have read almost all of Brian Jacques' works, and this may quite possibly be the best. The intriguing story of the badger lord and his arch-enemy draws you into its plot"
3,"Eh, it's normal","I've been a fan of Redwall for a while. They are usually very creative and exciting. This one is exciting, but it's got pretty much the same plot as the other Redwalls. Just different characters. Fans of Redwall only"
4,Good Book,Probably one of the better books I have read. But you will have a bit more trouble following the characters than you will the other Redwall books. That was the only downside. I remember I was hoping it would never end. But it did.
5,"Very interesting, in more than 1 way...","I have read other reviews before making mine, and people said Jacque was running out of ideas and it was so old. Although, Swartt had SIX claws, which made him seem like a particularly cunning villian, and it was neat to see how that heritage passed to Veil, and THAT is why he was in the story. And, if you can't handle slow reading, there isn't a book in the series that you should read. I think the books that explain how the Badger Lords come to rule the mighty mountian are CERTIANLY essential to the series, and belongs on any true Redwall fan's shelf."
4,Pretty Good.,"This is better than the others with that wierd accent even though it has some of that accent and i almost wasn't able to read it cause of that wierd girl who put the chicken bones and other things on her staff.It is pretty interesting.I had A friend At Redeemer named Ian Butler who has probably read all of them by now who loved these and i just wanted to say hi to him in case he comes on this sight.anyway i think this a very good book for 7-9 year olds and is very good.Yours Truly, Caleb A. Craig."
2,It takes a while to get into.,"If you like slow stories, this is the perfect book for you. Personally, I would not recommend this book to anyone. It is a huge book with not alot of action."
2,This book should be cast out from the series!,"I am a fan of the Redwall books and have read seven so far. They were Redwall, Martin the Warrior, Mossflower, The Outcast of Redwall, Salamandastron, Mattimeo, and Marlfox. Of those books, The Outcast was the worst,followed by Mattimeo. Both books had a gloomy feeling to them, but Mattimeo's characters were so god that they almost disguised that. The Outcast, however has very shallow characters. The book was more boring than the other books. I guess that any Redwall fan has to read it, but I don't reccomend it to those new to the series."
1,Hardcore Redwall Buffs Only,"I expected better from Brian Jacques! This book is slow, has no action or vivid characters, and basically, it's the worst Redwall book. I was sucked in by the description on the back cover, but nothing like that happens, and its just battles. I would say if you want to read a redwall book and you pick this up go back and reread pearls of lutra of bellmaker."
1,Second worst,"This book isn't quite as bad as Pearls of Lutra (but close). The plot and ending are predictable. The characters are annoying and unintelligent. Another example of bad writing. Brian Jacques needs to either stop writing Redwall, or try some originality in his books for once. Skip this book, go back and read 'Mossflower' or 'Mariel of Redwall' again."
1,"What's with the title, dude?","I wanted to read about a character that wasn't usual do-gooder Redwall mouse or squirrel or whatever. So I thought, a story about a shade of grey type ferret. AN ACTUAL CHANGE! How about that? Instead we get Super-Badger and the acutal OUTCASTING doesn't even happen until the LAST PAGE of Book 2 (of 3 btw). The (non) story between swartt and his dirty little secret son was so much more interesting than anything between that friggin badger and stupid bird. If you're going to call this ""Outcast of Redwall"", make it about the Outcast of Redwall. This should have been called ""Another Invincible Badger in the Land of Mossflower"". Horrible, just awful."
3,Outcast of Redwall,"It was decent. . . but it didn't live up to the Bellmaker and definitely not Redwall, the first book. The plot was just too predictable."
4,"A wonderful book, though very formulated.","Don't get me wrong - Outcast of Redwall is a positivly stunning book by my favorite author, Brian Jaques, but it seems so much the same as his other books! I've read quite a few Redwall tales, and they all have the same theme and basic story elements. If Jaques could make a totally original Redwall story, I think it would be great. The first Redwall story, ""Redwall"" still seems to me to be the best one. But, I'm not going to stop reading Redwall books anytime soon. So keep 'em coming, Brian, and we'll keep reading 'em!"
3,Outcast of Redwall books!,This book is my least favorite of the series and I have read the whole series except for the long patrol. It starts out okay in the first book then in the second book it gets really boring. The third book is okay but it has the same kind of end as the others do.
2,One more is one more to many.,"Once more we revisit the redwall series... and this time it is one time to many. The book runs into the problem of being predictable. It is much to similar to the other books in the series. The plot is lacking in many places and it just seems to go on for the sake of filling up more pages with text. While some of the other books were intresting, this book falls flat on it's face."
3,The worst in the series.,"This book has to be the worst book in the entire series. The plot and action are SOOO slow compared to Mattimeo and the Bellmaker. I have been a rabid Redwall fan for the longest time, and to tell you the truth, this one is worth skipping. There was really no point in the baby sixclaw, for he never did anything that the book flap said he did, and some parts didn't make sense."
5,Can't wait!,"Outcast of Redwall by Brian Jacques is a wonderful display of the artistry that comes in to play when you are writting a book. Outcast held my attention the hole way through. It tickled my funny bone at the antics at some of the characters. It made my mouth water at the descriptions of the vasts banquets which Redwallers call a simple meal. Oh, for some damson pie. This book made me proud to be a ""good guy"". Jacques also had me guess which accent went to which animal, hares I believe are English (maybe).The only thing that I would critize Jacques on would be his inconsistency through the series. There are few that I was able to pick out, but I don't want to ruin this perfectly good book for the avid Redwall Readers. I was able to forgo the subtle differences, because of the wonderful plot.All I have to say to Jacques is I can't wait for Pearls of Lutra to come out in paperback, so I can continue my series"
5,Exellent.....,"A real Redwall book. It has a very good beggining, middle & end. I like the personification. It has many disasters in store for the characters and more than one plot. A real page-turner."
3,not prime specimens,"Those who know the taste and feel of real fantasy adventure, Tolkien, Lewis, George MacDonaldheck, even Beatrix Potterwill find the Redwall series off-flavored. Definitely a wanna-be effort; the author doesn't seem to understand the genre deep down in his bones."
4,"This is a good book, but not the best.","I have also read every book in this series, and I like them all. This is a verry good book and is written verry well. I sugest that before you read this book You read Redwall it is the best, and you will get a good understanding of the whole series."
4,Book 8 rocks,A excellent story about good versus evil. A theme that looks can be decieving. Just because some and looks and acts bad doe not mean there is evil inside of him.Sun Flash the Mace the Badger has sworn to slay the Evil Swart six claw. To protect Salmastron and Mossflower from the Evil Swart six claw.It called out cast of Redwall because Swart the Fert has a soon who he abadoms on the battle field. He is addopted by the Redwaller. He is hate by must the people he is seen as evil does many bad thing. The only person who respect him is the Grand daugther of Gonf. Yes Gonf from Mossflower and Legend of Luke.Year go bye Swart is now and Adult so is sun Flash and he is big and he is a big buff badger. I mean it when Jacques wrote this series he decide to Make the young and middle age badger adnormal strong.Viel at the end of book two is exiled from Redwall from posioning one of the creatures living in the abbey. He goes and is filled with angry and rage.
5,One of his best!!,I love this book! The begging is exiting and it just gets better. Two things I didn't like: poor Skylarth 's ending and the conclution of Veil's true personality. But ya hafta love the rest of the book!!
5,Best Redwall book yet,"Like most book series, Redwall can be a bit unaccessible without reading the whole series from oldest to new. Also alot of the plots repeat themselves. But in Outcast, author Brian Jacques really treats his readers with the struggle that young Veil has trying to get Redwallers off his back, but soon ends up sacrificing himself for their survival.Also, Jacques doesn't actually have any situations in Redwall occuring until halfway into the book, which lets Jacques show much more surprising and interesting characters than he does in his other books. My favorite character has to be Swartt Sixclaw, who is also the most unique, whereas characters like Veil and Sunflash are too usual in a book like this. Sixclaw is really funny all through this book, constantly insulting his horde until they fall apart.This and Martin the Warrior are probably the best Redwall books and are some of the first you should ever read."
3,BORING!!,This story just kept on going and going. It also has the exact same plot as almost all the other books. I think Jacques must be running out of ideas.
3,Er it wasn't the best,Okay I admit it wasn't the best in the series I mean I have read evry one of them and this was not good.
5,Great Outcast of Redwall ROCKS!!!!!,This book could only be described as the best Redwall book yet. Sunflash and Skarlath are great. Sixclaw is treacherous and wild. His son Veil puts on a good show too.
5,Magnificent! My favorite!,"No matter what other people say, in my opinion, Outcast of Redwall is the best book ever written. Yes, it COULD do without mentioning Redwall, Bryony, or Veil, but other than that, it can't be beaten by any other book I've ever read! Outcast of Redwall is a necessity to the Redwall Series."
2,News flash: Lesbians do not have to come to a tragic end!,"I thought we had progressed away from this punish-the-deviant-lesbian theme that is a throw-back to the 50s but apparently not. I had high hopes for the story ending well but suddenly it veered off just before the end. Oddly enough, I know several of my fellow vagetarians who work in the therapy world who simply adore this movie, but I can't understand why. Don't they see enough tragedy claiming our LGBT population? Perhaps you'll like it as they do, but I am not a fan."
1,Not for grown-ups,"The manufacturer fails to mention that the strap that comes with this mask is very small and won't fit any grown up. I kept it at the loosest setting and it still wouldn't go around my head (which is relatively small compared to most people). Thinking it to be just the strap wanting to ""break in"", I tried forcing it around my head. Within a few minutes in the water, it opened up from the strain.Again, this item is just unusable by a grown-up, which the manufacturer fails to mention anywhere on the product packaging or advertising."
5,Very comfortable,"I bought this bra and the medela softcup and wear this one all the time. It is very comfortable it provides good support (I'm a 40C). I love that it provides coverage around the back(fits like a sports bra) and eliminates the ""back bulge"" that can come from wearing bras w/o underwires (my complaint about the Medela). The fabic is soft and holds up good to washing. It allows you to wear v-necklines if you wish. My only complaint would be that the white bra has thin fabric on the cups because when I were a white t-shirt you can see a darker shadow from my areolas. I own about a dozen differant nursing bras and this is my favorite by far."
4,"Very practical, but not perfect","This is great for sports. I recently went to the doctor for an injury I had while playing raquetball. The hand therapist recommended using ice after each raquet, tennis match ot golf to relax the muscles and prevent tennis elbow and carpa tunnel.This thing does the job. Once the ice is out, it makes for a very easy massage and if you don't mind the cold water as it melts it's great! However, sometimes it's hard to use it, specially when it's fresh out of the freezer, since you can barely move the ice, or you don't want to get wet."
3,Pro-Tec Ice Up,The product is convenient. If you regularly do ice massage for sore areas its worth the money. Getting the ice moving initially can be troublesome. Usually a hard smash on a table or other hard surface will dislodge the ice and start it sliding smoothly.
4,Mayflower Families #18 Part 2 WArren,I am related to Richard Warren who was on the Mayflower. This book is the middle book in a set of 3 books. I am descended from 2 children of Richard Warren who are Nathaniel and Elizabeth. This book provides me with information that I did not have.
2,"Review for ""Jaguar""","I originally purchased this DVD because of the other good reviews. I was very disappointed because there was not much footage of jaguars, nor was much research presented. Rather, this was a documentary of the jaguar researcher. You hear about his troubled childhood, you meet his mentor, you meet his wife and children, you see him in the hospital being treated for cancer, and you see his entire life story, etc. etc. It's not this this information is not interesting, but I wanted to see a nature documentary, and this essentially is a biography on a scientist. I would say less than 1/3 of the DVD shows actual footage of jaguars. If you want to see a pure nature documentary, do not waste your money on this."
4,Jaguar conservation,"There's an important message in this DVD. Watching the passion these scientists have for their subject is moving. This is a piece that should be shown in schools to boost awareness. An eyeopener, beautifully filmed and produced. Worth watching."
1,Not a good choice for learning painter,"Painter 5 Complete is not a good introduction for the beginner or intermediate user. I have found I learned much more stumbling around in the dark or from the official Painter manual that ships with the program. The tutorials tend to be inaccurate and dont lead to a further understanding of the program. There is nothing ""complete"" about this book at all. Buy the Painter5 WoW book instead--although more advanced it will get you up to speed much quicker and more enjoyably."
2,Horribly organized and written.,"I'm new to Fractal Painter and was looking for a comprehensive volume with tutorials. This book is written by an artist with what appears to be a focus on people already familiar with version 4 of this software. Incredibly, this is how the book begins, rather than placing the ""Changes from Version 4"" in an appendix where it belongs. The text is sloppy when referring to on-screen controls and there is virtually nothing in the way of tutorials. There is nothing that describes concepts that are crucial to working with Painter's quirky controls. I'd recommend staying away from this book unless already an expert with Version 4. Even then, it's pretty bad. Where were the editors when this was written?"
2,Small for the price,"I was disappointed in the size of this toy when it arrived. It fits in my palm, and for $15 I thought it would be larger. It's a fun toy and takes off easily on the hard floors, but is smaller than expected."
2,Won't buy again.,"I like the colors and the package arrived timely and well packaged. My only problem is that the paper doesn't cut well. I thought maybe I needed a new blade in my cutter, changed it, still tore when cut. I have 2 different brand cutters, both tear the paper. I thought maybe I was doing something wrong and asked my friend to try on both her cutter and mine, tore every time. So if you think that you may have to trim this paper to a smaller size or shape, don't get it. I ended up hand trimming the little jagged pieces off and just don't use it if I need something small. Won't buy again."
5,Go a mazing with this amazing book!,"Looking for the perfect gift for that puzzle buff friend of yours? Look no further. Mad Mazes is a delightful book of 20 different mazes, each with its own rules for traveling through the maze. Each maze is challenging and fun and, if you solve it, you will shout Eureka! In this book, you see the genius of Robert Abbott at work and at play! We call him the O. Henry of puzzles as his solutions often have a surprise or twist to them. Each maze is preceded by a fun story which gives the rules for traveling through the maze. So, whether you are 7 or 107, if you enjoy challenging puzzles, this treasure of a book is for you. The good news is that Robert Abbott has written a wonderful sequel to Mad Mazes. It is called SuperMazes."
5,Wondefully intricate puzzles for the stubborn or brilliant,"By saying the word ""maze"" I'm probably conjuring the image of those flat angles of black lines. This is NOT what you'll get if you buy this book. Mad Mazes is precisely that--each maze has a complex set of dynamic rules. One allows you only to turn right--unless you pass a certain point, after which you can only turn left. Another is three-dimensional, and you climb and descend levels in an effort to reach bottom. You actually have to (gasp) think. I first got this book 6-7 years ago and still haven't solved all the puzzles! (And there are only twenty, to my everlasting regret.) Each is accompanied with illustrations and a delightfully humorous story."
5,Excellent Book,Excellent book. You will not regret buying this book. This is a great book to give someone as a gift. They will love you for it.
4,Works as it should,"My wife loves it. Remember, this is henna, not a commercial dye. It will cover the gray (my wife looks great after she does her hair) but eventually washes out. It is safe and leaves the hair with a subtle lustre."
2,Hennalucent just OK,"I got this product because of the reviews I read from the internet.I am allergic to hair dye so I thought I would give this a try sinceit received great reviews. First of all, it did not cover my gray hair. After Iused it, I read in the product insert that it will really not cover gray hair.Second, it made my hair shiny for a while but after a few days the shine was gone.Third, it made me itch a bit but nothing to be alarmed about.I still gave it 2 stars since this is the first time I used it. Maybe onthe 2nd or 3rd application, it will have better results. Also, it's very affordable!"
1,Hair color stinks,The product was green like spinach when mixed and looked like mud. It smelled really bad and did nothing for my hair. The color certainly didn't look anything like the picture on the box. Don't waste your money!
1,These are grown in California.,"I bought them at a local foodie-palace, but I don't think the proprietess had really looked at the label. It's a clever way to repackage standard variety tomatoes with an expensive-sounding name. San Marzanos form Italy can be wonderful, and expensive. Canned tomatoes from California might be, but these are not. Stay Away."
1,Zero Stars?,"These are a can full of nasty. Yes, more of a scam than anything. I'm very sorry for the positive reviewers - as there are simply certain things in the culinary world that are a complete 180 degree shift when you have quality and sub-par - tomatoes are one of those things. Tomatoes aren't like pizza - when even the bad ones are pretty good. For a tomato to be good, you need bright &pure tasting fruit, proper acidity, and lack of detracting flavors. These have none of these traits. They taste metallic, processed and bland. So, no offense (ok maybe a little) meant to the positive reviews, but buy and DOC tomatoes and taste next to these. If you can't tell the difference, you probably shouldn't be writing food reviews on Amazon."
1,Bogus Marketing BS,"These are not San Marzano tomatoes at all. Someone was clever enough to name their company San Marzano knowing that naive consumers would be aware of the cache that real DOP San Marzano tomatoes carry and mistakenly think that they were getting a great deal. What they are getting is just a domestic plum tomato. And frankly, these tomatoes are even weak for a domestic whole peeled tomato."
2,"Not great, not San Marzano either...","Everyone knows now that the brand name is San Marzano, but these tomatoes are not grown in this region of Italy nor are they from San Marzano seed. All in all, the product is a round, domestic tomato with added preservatives. What I don't understand is how they can say these are grown from San Marzano seed. If they were from San Marzano seed wouldn't they have an elongated shape rather than a round one? I'm also surprised at how many people think the DOP stamp on other Italian tomatoes are some sort of guarantee of quality. The fact is there are more cans of DOP Italian tomatoes being sold than DOP tomatoes being grown in Italy. You do the math. Most DOP products also have added preservatives and basil. I personally look for natural brands at my local Italian deli for the best luck with tomatoes. The best thing is to try several brands and decide for yourself."
1,Not the real thing,I was fooled by the San Marzano label and bought 2 cans. Only to later find out San Marzano is a region and the authentic canned San Marzanos say D.O.P. and have the 3 stamps. The real San Marzano tomatoes do not contain citric acid.
1,Just this side of outright fraud!,"This Calif. company managed to use the San Marzano name in their brand name, but these are in no way, shape or form actually San Marzano tomatoes.They are overpriced and HORRIBLE.Do not buy this brand if you are looking for real San Marzano tomatoes, Progresso tomatoes are better for 1/3 the price.These people should be ashamed of themselves."
1,poor substitue,"I teach pasta class and make sauces. A student brought in a can to try based on the lower cost. We found the tomatoes to be watery and very acidic, a very poor substitue for the real thing - I will stick to DOP."
3,"not bad, but","Pretty decent comp, but maybe not as wide ranging as that Nine O'Clock Drop comp Nuphonic put out in the same genre (post-punk dance). What's up with the liner notes though? Reads like they were written by a fourteen year-old for a book report. Dubious."
1,Total waste of money,If I could give this product less than one star I would. It is a total waste of money. My experence in computers made me buy this product thinking I could get it to work unlike the other newbies. Boy was I wrong as it did not work with the 4 phones I bought it for. The only good points the company gets is for such nice packaging the product comes in. Someone needs to work out their software bugs as they have a very good product.I am so ashamed Amazon would continue to sell such a product after so many negative reviews. If Amazon had a rating system like Ebay the Datapilot would not get any customers to buy their product.This is also the only product that I have seen that DOES NOT allow a customer to send feedback to the seller. Don't waste your time trying to get help from the company either.The only other good point about the product is the cables it comes with as it is possible to use them with other software packages like Motorola Phone Tools.
1,Terrible,"I purchased this package and am extremely disappointed. The software is pretty crude. It will merge contacts from Outlook, but it will not syncronize them. What you end up with is a ton of duplicate entries that you must then go back and manually sort. Save your money and get something else."
1,Avoid the middle man - flush your money straight down the toilet !!!,Truly a waste of money. Useless level 1 tech support. Obnoxious phone queue forces you to listen to their terrible audiotext message over and over and over again every 15 seconds. No toll free tech support.Our install insisted upon Admin credentials while in fact the install was being done in Admin account. Junior tech support gave us a workaround. That didn't help.Then they sent us an applet so they could get a snapshot of our system info. Still no help.Getting ready to call the credit card company and file a dispute.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!!I WISH I HAD READ ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS FIRST !!!!
1,COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.,"This company has the right idea, but is way too greedy, you can only use this software for 8 phones. Once you try using it on the 9th phone it makes you buy another license. Personally, i carry 2 phones, and I upgrade every couple months. I only got to use this software a couple times (I transfered my brothers phonebook), and now it tells me I need to buy a license."
2,Horrendous,"I've used hundreds of software programs over the years, and this application ranks among the three worst (I'd venture to say it is the worst). I have attempted to use this produce for approximately 2 years now. Despite episodes of successful utilization, the program has consistently given me problems at pretty much every step, from downloading and installing the program to establishing contact with my phone and executing synchronization. Unfortunately, it is one of the few products that sychronizes cell phone calendars with Outlook's calendar. Nonetheless, I decided I was fed up with this product, and installed a different synchronization application, which has posed no problems thus far (though it does not synchronization my Outlook calendar with my phone's calendar). Considering I have a Pocket PC, this is a small price to pay for the reduced hassle."
1,Dissatisfied,"We bought this Suite for the Motorola V730, after verifying from the customer support that it was supported. Well, there is no cell communication on two different phones we tried, and most functions a blanked out on the pull down menues. I rate it a 5+ on the SUX scale, and the enclosed documentation even SAYS THE PHONE IS SUPPORTED. It would be a great software suite if it WORKED! ZERO STARS IS NOT SUPPORTED ON THESE REVIEWS, OR IT WOULD GET A ZERO."
3,"Ok, could be better.","Program does what it is suppose to do, but installation can be a little bit tricky. Tech support fairly good."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"Fellow Amazon Shoppers: I purchased DataPilot just over a year ago (not from Amazon) and it was a complete headache trying to get the software drivers to load and recognize the phone correctly. After much effort and repeated trips to their disappointing website (the included instruction sheet is useless), I was finally able to download my cell phone's numbers. However, I just tried to re-perform a data download and the same exact technical issues plagued me this year. Yet again the device drivers and software are so poorly written that I was not able to perform this SEEMINGLY SIMPLE STEP. I am currently a CIO, have run a corporate IT department, and I have been a software developer (and my current company develops imaging software). While the concept is awesome, this product is not ready for commercial sale. If you see a post that states this product is anything but junk, suspect that the person writing the post works for Susteen (the selling company)."
1,WORST support ever,"Product worked just OK, but would not update. Benny Wong provided smug and terse responses to emails for support, obviously not reading the emails he was answering. Eventually he sent a link to a download that rendered the program completely unusable. After that, he stopped responding to all emails. Now I have a program that won't work and cannot be registered again to reactivate because it is already registered."
1,dated,really a didn't work well for me. It would never discover the phone when I needed it to. the software interface was glitchy at best. no clear troubleshooting ideas/tips. I am glad everything is all USB now. makes life much easier
1,I was totally ripped off,"I went to their website ([...]) to see if the phone I intended to purchase was supported. Unfortunately, it wasn't. So, I found a different phone of the same brand that was supported and bought it instead. Then, I purchased the Data Pilot software. The synchronization did not work with the phone they advertised as being supported. So, I wrote to their support. I didn't hear back for over a week. So I sent another support request. After about another week, I finally heard from them. A terse one sentence response saying my phone was not supported. I took screen captures of their website showing that the phone was advertised as being supported and sent it to them. I never heard back. Don't buy this product unless you are somehow absolutely certain it works with your phone. Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support. I was ripped off and there is nothing I can do about it."
2,"Horrible, Cludgy software","I've been using Datapilot software for a little less than a year. It's difficult to use, connection to cell phone can be problematic at times (everything must be done in the right order), and upgrades to the software aren't automatic as they say... it seems you must request an upgrade and they send you a link with a password. Overall, if you're used to intuitive software and don't need the hassle, I'd steer clear. While I've used it ONLY to make backup copies of my cell phonebook, I've come to the conclusion that I'd spend less time re-keying in the entire phonebook than I've already spent trying to work with this software."
1,Only has Eight (8) Phone Connection Limit!,"There is a very small detail I overlooked when purchasing this product. It can be found in VERY small print at the bottom of the box:""DataPilot software is for personal use only, therefore you can connect and transfer data to a maximum of 8 different mobile phones.""I bought this thinking I could use it on my friends and family's phones to help them out too.I did my research before buying but missed this VERY big point.Only get this if you intend to ever connect 8 or less devices. Otherwise you will be VERY disappointed."
1,OLD STOCK,"SUSTEEN DataPilot Universal Cell Phone Data Transfer KitThis is OLD STOCK, it does not have the latest cables.BEWARE"
4,Very Pleased Despite Other Reviews,"Despite other reviews, I still wanted to give the Datapilot a try. I have used it for a Sanyo, Nokia, and Motorola RZR and all worked fine in copying the phone book. It was sometimes tricky to get it to recognize the phone, but it always eventually did. Because of the time it took to get the phone recognized, I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5."
1,Overpriced junk software that is unreliable,"First I bought the universal kit for a mind boggling $80, then had to pay $30 for the cable for my phone + $9 shipping handling (I'm supposed to get a $10 rebate, but I'm still waiting). After spending over $100 for this, I installed it, and appeared to have succefully installed the driver for my Audiovox 8910. When I load the DataPilot software and try to connect to COM3 (the Susteen cable), it does not recognize my device. After spending some much time with the ackward install process and having to pay extra for a cheap cable, I am returning this junk."
1,What Some Crap!,"Bought this ""software"" elsewhere. (Fry's)Absolute CRAP! I've been in software for over 30 years and have not seen many applications as lame as this one! Over four hours and the Crap App won't install correctly. This is Pathetic! I really wonder if ANYONE ever got this junk to install and run correctly.Searches have shown their support is useless.I would suggest AVOIDING this product- if you can call it that."
1,Won't Register,"Tried to install it. installed OK, but when I tried to open it it kept saying I had no internet access to run it and to check my firewall. I turned off my firewall, same result. Uninstalled"
1,Truly NOT Universal!,"I purchased this software because it indicated that I would be able to retrieve my pictures from my older LG C2000 cell phone. I discovered that not only did it not support that function, the software is unstable and did in fact cause other problems on my Windows XP OS. I could'nt get it off of my machine fast enough!!"
1,Not useful for syncing with outlook.. ok for one time backup (maybe),"The Software claims to support many phone and allow sync with outlook. However its very difficult to use. In this age of smart phones, you have to visit their website support forms and read about ""phone not found"" to configure it for Android. They should have this in default help page. This is with latest version.It can import address book and calender from outlook and phone but does not sync them. Now I have duplicate entries in the datapilot software (which I must say has poor interface itself). This seems to be task of novice software writer who is trying to sell an unfinished product. I am disappointed.Verdict: Do not waste your money on this product."
1,JohnnyDancer,"ZERO STARS - Dec 3 2011 online download & purchase of DataPilotSusteen Datapilot Cell Phone Data Transfer Suite Universalwent smooth. However after installation it turned BAD. Requirements say XP operating sys is okay, but when you try to connect phone, it asks for MS ActiveSync program (which at 1st I did not have). So, easy enough, go to MS downloads, and get it. BUT, MS says ActiveSync will NOT WORK unless XP SP2 or LOWER. Everyone with XP would have upgraded to SP3 by now. And if you try to force ActiveSync to load, it will create many operating system issues. BOTTOM LINE: Don't buy this s/w. Use Good Sync instead."
3,Pen marking on the inside of the helmet,This package is really pretty good for its price. I am just taken aback from the pen marking (some numbers were scribbled!) on the inside of the helmet. The markings made me wonder if that was a defect code that was scribbled or probably a returned item.Another thing that was weird was the delivery method that Amazon decided to use. I placed my order on the 6th and received my shipment on the 17th!
5,Good replacement,My NuTone light came with a GE bulb. This one warms up faster and is brighter than the original. I'm glad I ordered 2!
5,A Triple Play,"Two late-career live performances by Chet Baker are the reason to buy this set, but the real sleeper is in the tribute disc, where the incredible voice of Davia Sacks will blow you away on ""You Can't Go Home Again."""
5,THE BEST BOOK for your REVIEW!!,"I bought this book for my studies of the PTCB test that took place in March 2005 & PASSED the test!!! This book has IDENTIICAL questions from the PTCB test itself!!! Trust me... I bought the book and took the test!!! ONE KEY THING... DO NOT PURCHASE the latest edition (7th). It has the EXACT same questions, pages, etc. If you can find the 6th edition or maybe a used one... then go for it. I wish you all the best!!!Carla Luna, CPhT as of April 19th, 2005."
5,Ignore my previous review.,seller swiftly resolved the dispute. Book is in excellent shape. Glad to do business with A++
5,Bachelor and Outdoorsman #1 Utensil,"I have really enjoyed this 4-qt #10 Dutch Oven!! It is the perfect size for one person's cooking. I cook everything with it. Stews, Soups, Whole Chickens and Roasts, even breakfasts and desserts!! The lid, when inverted on a couple of bricks, cooks up perfect eggs!!I take my Dutch Oven with me wherever I go. I just pack it up in an optional tote bag, throw it in the back of the Tahoe, along with charcoal and starting equipment, and then cook at the park, at work, at a friend's house, wherever!!I enjoy watching most people look at this ""strange"" contraption and setup and then letting them take a whiff as I stir the food around. They are always hungrier than I am!! It drives a campground pure CRAZY!!I have other size Lodge Duth Ovens, but I HIGHLY recommend this one for personal all around cooking!!"
1,This sucks,"Of all the season review dvs's, this is by far the worst. This season review should have been a celebration of the 19th title, instead the producer has tried to show what he can do with editing. All the goals are filmed in strange angles and the commentary is from manutd.comIf I could give this 1/2 stars, I would.DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!"
1,Recall this product,"Being a lifelong ManU supporter, I have purchased many of their season reviews. This is the worst. The footage of the goals being scored shows the goals from so many different angles that they took the excitement of the moment out of the event. It is difficult to say what the producers were attempting, but the video footage makes it very frustrating to look at."
1,Dreadful shame,"I am hugely disappointed by this dvd. The editing is infuriating, and for such an important season, and collectable dvd, this is a pathetic attempt. 2Entertain and Paul Doherty need to be brought back to figure this out.Don't buy this dvd. Let's make them make another one, and we'll buy that"
3,Fan of United,"Compared with other season reviews of Manchester United, I expected a better product. I preferred to watch goals with one constant camera, not more cameras. It doesn't let me feel the real joy of goals and highlights."
1,I have to agree with everyone else....,"I read the reviews, but I still tried to go in with an open mind. But yeah absolutely awful, what makes it bad is the camera angles. Rather than showing the standard telecast goal followed by replays from varied angles, they show only angled replay shots and it really kills it and takes you out of it. If that isn't a deal killer to you than this is pretty much the same as with previous seasons. ( aside from that)"
1,Worst production I have ever seen - NO STARS FOR ME!,"I first started following United In 1969 and have been collecting United end of season reviews from the day they started In the old VHS format right to the present DVDs and, this latest edition is the worse effort I have seen so far.How were this production company allowed to get away with this?"
1,DO NOT BUY!!,These season reviews are usually a highlight of the year for me as im not able to attend any games live. But this latest one is the biggest load of garbage.. So many great highlights we will never get to see properly. I am so disppointed and angry!!
1,Manchester United Season Review 2010-2011,"I was so excited to receive this dvd as a gift, but could not have been more disappointed once I started watching it. They change camera angles every couple of seconds, which makes it impossible to tell what it going on. There is no build up play showed, and all the commentary is from manutd.com rather than the actual game announcers. Very disappointing dvd, I didn't even want to finish it."
2,Very Disappointing,"For more or less the last 20 years, the United season reviews have been exactly what they should be: all the goals and highlights from the entire season with interesting vignettes about players and the context within the season. This year's DVD is woefully below the standard set by years of excellence with Paul Doherty International. A new company took over this year, and it's hard to imagine it being much worse. Not only are the vast majority of the goals shown from bizarre and ineffective camera angles, but coverage of some games is literally seconds long. The commentary is also plucked from MUTV instead of using the Sky commentary, which definitely takes it down another notch. Bring back the old style, and the fans will be happy again."
4,Great season great DVD.,"I think this is a great DVD, we watch it all the time and can't stop once we start. All the goals from the whole season, in order all the way through, Premier League, FA Cup and the Champions League. I still would recommend it for Manchester United fans (or most any soccer fan) only thing i'd suggest is to make it longer."
2,Great Season. Horrible Product.,"I've been buying these reviews for as long as they've been doing them & always enjoyed them, more recently with my kids who love the whole 'season in a couple of hours' excitement these DVD's USUALLY give you.This one is HORRIBLE though. It must have been edited by someone with A.D.D. I don't know if the ploy was to give us ""never seen before' camera angles but it just fails miserably as 95% of the time, just as the goalscorer is about to connect with the ball, Mr Editor decides to change angle, slow things down, spin things around, replay his favourite bit three times & you're left with a headache trying to follow the action & the excitement is sucked away in a mist of frustration.I know there's perfectly watchable, crystal clear footage of every goal in every match featured here. They just don't use it.***** for the team & the season* for this product"
3,Nice casual flatware,"We bought this for our son who is in his mid twenties. He is very hard on housewares, and this set has held up well. Even does nicely in the dishwasher. He has enjoyed using these items."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"Very pleased with quality of product for such low price (even with shipping to Australia). Follow manufacturers advice on cleaning, doesnt like lemon based products at all....spots in dishwasher, not so when changing from lemon to other product. Colour is strong and matches image on screen. Have since ordered two more sets as gifts for family members. Great day to day use cutlery set."
5,Cambridge Silversmih Red silerware,"Love my red Cambridge Silverware that I ordered. Was worried about the quality, for some silverware are cheap looking. Rest assured these are quality silverware, you will be as pleased as I am."
5,Liked them so much looking for different colors,"I bought two sets to have service for 8 and am very pleased. They are bright, apple red. The weight is very good and they have not bent. I am now looking for two more sets in white so I can mix and match. And excellant purchase for this price."
5,Review of my flatware,"this is the most best flarware I have ever purchased. The quality is grear, It looks great in my kitchen and easy to clean."
4,Very nice set.,I think the set looks better than the picture. I ordered the red color for my mother and she is very pleased. They looked more expensive than the price.
2,Look nice in picture but cheaply made......,"I ordered this item because they looked high quality. These are very light in ""feel"" and seen cheaply made and don't appear as if they'll last very long at all.."
1,Very disappointed when I received this product.,"I expected more than I received, so evidently price is a primary factor when ordering flatware. The edges near the plastic are sharp and unlike my older set which are even to where one can't cut oneself. I should have ordered a more expensive set, but will save this for some occasion or give it away."
3,Great for the price you are paying. Not equivalent to the higher priced ones.,"These are great for the price you are paying, but not equivalent to the higher priced ones. As an industrial designer I see many places where they tried to cut costs."
4,"Good tape, minor issue","This roll of Gaffer's tape was purchased to secure audio cables for a holiday show produced at an elementary school. The tape functioned as expected and did not leave glue residue on floors or cables. One minor issue was a length of paper backing approximately 8 inches long that was exposed at about the 50 yard point in the roll. It would appear that it joined two batches of tape together. The tape with the paper backing had no adhesive exposed, so it was less useful.Overall, a good value for a professional quality, high visibility tape."
2,"Cuts out on me, too",I bought mine used. Never seemed very loud for the stated power. It started powering down with greater frequency until it became unusable.
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! it is a fluke,"Purchased this amp because it is rated 1000w. I was under the impression that this would be a good replacement of my 500Watts Behringer, however I've learn from the hard way and realized it was a big waste of money. The 30 watts guitar amp is even louder than this. I kept it for a year because it sound decent on keyboard when I tested in my living room but when I use on the medium sized gig OMG! it does distort and clipping. as soon as I got home I whacked and destroyed with baseball bat due to big frustration and dropped off next morning to local electronic recycle company....Sorry I did put 1 star because there's no ""0"" star option. very very disappointed with it, this is my first and last to own soundcraft."
5,What we were looking for!,Good value for the money. We use this for our church services and it has done well for us. Easy to use.
2,Power Overrated,"I have used PA amps to power my keyboard instead of a keyboard amp because they are much less money. My last one was a Behringer PNP2000. It lasted 3 years before it just stopped delivering any sound. I bought GigRac after shopping alot. I bought it primarily for the ""suitcase style"" of carrying it (to protect the knobs), as well as it's power. But I am dissapointed in the output of this amp. I have to use it in bridge mode at 75% main power using an 8 ohm speaker. If I use the channel setting above 1 o'clock position, it clips and distorts the sound.I have a hard time competing with guitar players using 75 watts amps and I'm supposed to have 1000?"
3,"Good, engaging, and yes, short!","I've read and enjoyed a lot of Brown's work, wherein his shorter stories generally consist of a grim one-two punch. I don't find anything wrong with that - but when mixed in are a few of his longer works, the ones where the characters and plot are developed more deeply, it can leave the other stories feeling lacking. That said, MADMEN'S DREAMS is nonetheless a fun, brisk read."
5,"6 Million Albums in the US, no less!","This is a great album. These Radio PD's need a good kick in the head if they don't play Tina's music soon. I'm really impressed by all the songs. A CD that is going to be the next ""must"" have. ""If I was a river"" is a sure hit and ""Sixteen"" is a great summer time cruise song in the convertible. Hey, guys get this one for your babe and she will be thoroughly impressed. Get it before everybody else finds out. My football buddies (and their girlfriends) have also throughly enjoyed this album. Great job, Tina!"
5,great work!,"It's the first time I listen to the songs of Arena.She has a wonderful voice.Each song has a different feeling and she incredibly suits her voice to those songs such as she sings with a dramatically powerful voice in ""Burn"" ""If I didn't love you"" and ""Flashback"" but she can cool down her voice to a sad song like ""Not for sale"".I like ""Stay"" so much but the most favorite is the ""Not for sale"".My tears always begin to fall down every time I hear the song.For me,it's like I'm bathing with a flesh cool shower when I hear Arena sings the songs in this CD.More than words can say,you may percieve this album by your own spirit."
5,An excellent book for experimentalists,"A great book to help experimentalists truly understand their results and more importantly the uncertainty associated with their measurements. This book and Taylor's book ""An introduction to Error Analysis"" are a must read."
1,Don't waste your $7.50,"This download is a waste of your money. Fully one-third of the pages are user-license and table of contents, the print is too big, and the margins are immense. Finally, the information that is provided is nothing special...and hardly even a good outline to use as a basis for study."
3,Nexcare Downgraded Product,The supplier delivered the Nexcare product as advertised. Nexcare drops are OK but no longer great.Nexcare appears to have downgraded the product from its original formulation. It still works OK but does not last as long. The original version held up on fingers to dozens of hand washing cycles but was tricky to handle just like Crazy Glue. The new product dries more slowly and disappears after a few washings. Nexcare Please bring back the old formulation.
1,Hate this toy!!!!,"I bought this for my son a few years ago because he loved buses, but I was soon sorry I did. It was very loud and annoying, and he stopped playing with it after a short while. The characters tell annoying, stupid jokes over and over, and worst thing was that it kept saying ""Push one of my friends""- a GREAT thing to tell a kid to do. Of course they meant one of the ""friends"" on the little bus, but I'm not sure if my son realized that! I tried to contact the company to complain about that one, but they never responded."
2,Friendly but LOUD and REPETITIVE,"Leap frog makes quite a few good learning toys. Unfortunately, I'd recommend many others before this one. Although the voices are fun and friendly, the volume is much too LOUD. The jokes are repetitive; they get boring within a few minutes.On the positive side, it is a durable bus. My 2 boys can do a lot of damage, but this one (to my not so secret regret) survives all that energy. I like that the letters are all capitals, my oldest (age 3) sometimes has difficulty doing letter identification with lower case letters.The volume, however, is over the top, even muffled with some tape over the speaker. My boys didn't use it for learning their letters. It had more appeal as another vehicle to play demolition derby (and you can get something much cheaper and less obnoxious) You can only hear the phrase ""push one of my friends"" so many times before trying to stuff the bus to the back of the toy closet."
3,Great ideas... but the sounds are distorted,"My son received this for his 2nd birthday. He does love pushing the letters and hearing the sounds but I agree with other posters.. The voices of the animals are hard to understand. There is a button that you can push that says... ""S"" sounds like ssssssssss and its hard to make out sometimes what the sound actually sounds like. My son does like singing to Wheels on the Bus however........"
2,NOT TOO EXCITING,This item is a waste of money. My daughter got it when she was 2. The only thing she enjoyed doing was honking the horn and listening to the few animal sounds it played. The alphabet didn't interest her at all. When you press a button it says the name and sound. My daughter could care less. She played with it for about a week and then it became a dust collecter. Not a good choice!
5,This is a great toy,"And I use the toy loosely because it has such great educational value. My youngest daughter has an Autism spectrum disorder and we purchased this for her, and with this she has successfully learned the Alphabet! What a great toy! LeapFrog makes very durable toys, educational and fun too!A must purchase for anyone wanting the best for their baby."
5,great toy!,my sister got this toy for her 5th birthday and i play with it more then she does and we're 7 years apart! (i'm 12!)
3,Not so happy with this!,We really like Magna doodles but not this one...it really does not work so good and it just isn't worth it for me! Pass on this one.
2,Very Misleading,"The picture they use is very misleading. The ""color"" componant is comprised of three dry erase markers. The eraser that is included does not erase in the least bit, so you have to use a wet paper towel or equivalent. Stick to the basic Magnadoodle as the color one has no added benefits."
2,Marker doesn't wipe off easily,"I was excited to find a doodle pad that had color with it, but the dry erase markers do not wipe off very easily and the whole pad was very oily. I'm guessing from the markers. We wiped it down, but there is still a film on it. Cannot get the marker to completely wipe off with the pad that came with it."
1,"with so many good lullaby CDs, why buy this?","YUCK. The songs are great, but some are loud, some are quiet, some pretty and some are noisy. Completely inconsistent. Just about the time my baby falls asleep a loud, racous lullaby begins. YUCK."
1,Fly By Night Production,"If ever there was a good decision you made, it was to read the reviews of this product before buying it. If you are looking for a lullaby CD for your child KEEP LOOKING. This CD is terrible! If you play the first two songs and have the volume adjusted to the soothing melody, you are thinking, 'hey this CD isn't half bad.' Then Track 3 (a ridiculously bad rendition of Rock a Bye Baby) comes on at about 350 decibels higher than the prior songs, sending you madly dashing to the CD player to turn the sound down before half the neighborhood comes banging down your door or calls the police -- not to mention the baby you were just trying to get to sleep is wailing in your ear because you were an IDIOT and bought this CD despite the horrible reviews on Amazon! And if you keep listening it will happen again and again! Fun!"
2,"Lose tracks 3, 6, and 11!!!!","Beautiful, soothing melodies interspersed with loud, jolting, horrid vocals. The first (and only) time I played this I was nursing my peaceful baby to sleep, only to have him jolted awake by a sudden, loud singing. Tracks 1 & 2 are soothing... then 3 has you jumping out of your seat... tracks 4 and 5, soothing... 6 has the baby screaming... 7 and 8 are fine, but I held my breath (and my baby's ears) as 9 began (thinking there might be a pattern), but 9 and 10 were fine -- only to have 11 slap us in the face. If you buy this inexpensive CD, do what I did: load it into your computer, delete tracks 3, 6, and 11, and burn it on to a new CD -- now it's fine. I only regret I did not read the reviews before purchasing!! I bought a second copy as a gift for someone else -- I guess I'll save it to give to someone I don't really like..."
1,Don't Buy This,"I should have paid more attention to the reviews that said the quality of music was terrible, but I don't have much musical training and I've never been able to distinguish between performances so I thought I wouldn't notice. I was wrong. The quality of music here is VERY poor. About the only thing I got out of it was learning the titles of songs I liked already but didn't know what they were called so I can now go out and buy a much better rendition. It's cheap, but don't waste your money."
3,Could've been a 5-star if not for the heinous tracks,"I'm bobbing my head up and down with the other reviewers about the obnoxious non-lullaby tracks thrown in on this CD. After burning a new CD and leaving those tracks off, the CD is great and one of my favorites."
2,Not all Lullabies,"All of these songs are versions of lullabies, but they're not all performed that way. ""Rock-a-by Baby"" and ""Twinkle, Twinkle"" are examples of this. They're upbeat, louder than other tracks on the CD, and totally ruin the feel of it. This won't work as a lullaby album and isn't that great just as a kids' album either."
1,Disappointing,"Although this is a promising collection of music, it is certainly not the best recording of each piece. The biggest problem, however, is that the sound levels for each song are so different that it is impossible to set the right volume. The pieces with the vocals are especially jarring."
4,"Amazing movie, definitely worth a look","Some people are probably put off by this movie, since most people seem to prefer the fairy-tale world a lot of films create. You won't see any of that in ""Pups"". What's really unique about this film is it's similarity to reality; it gives the film an almost documentary-like feel, without taking away the emotional aspects. You can really feel for the characters-- whether you love them or hate them, this movie definitely inspires emotion. I would recommend ""Pups"" to anyone who isn't offended easily and who doesn't mind a movie that requires you to actually use your brain a little."
4,thrilling,"when I was twelve, flipping though the channels I stumbled upon PUPs though I didnt know what it was called then. I knew I really liked the movie and was bummed I never knew what it was called or who it was with, imagine my surpise when I found out it was with Misha Barton who is an talented actress. Then About a month ago I remembered A movie where two teens who robbed a bank and who kept me interested til the very end; I wrote the storyline of the movie and I found it. I can't believe it took me 12 years to remember but im glad I did. I would suggest it to everyone to watch it. Minors watch with parantal advision but adults though its teens it is amazing and keeps you guessing, The only I didn't like was the ending but overall my all time fave movie."
5,Do or Die,"A daring project, an honest look at kids and violence in America. The director is brilliant!"
1,unbelievable,"i came across this at 3am this week on hbo, and i cant begin to tell you how awful and painfully unbelievable this movie is. ANYONE in that bank could have broken that little brat in half by merely grabbing his wrist. this movie only works as an example of how far tarantino has influenced movies in a negative way, though he has done some good also....anyway, stay away from this pile and watch something intelligent like the Usual Suspects or Memento instead"
3,"Another sweet romance, quick read","Stevie Corbett is a professional tennis player with an emergency health problem that could possibly keep her from playing in the tennis match of a life time- the Wimbledon! She must decide whether to risk her health for the opportunity to play, this being the thing that she has strived for all her life- the ultimate goal to reach. Judd Mackie, sports writer, is out to find out what Stevie is hiding from her fans- to write that article that his editor is hounding him for. Both Stevie and Judd have pasts of hurt that they have not healed from- not allowing themselves to have relationships with others. That's about to change. But they are about to find strong desire for love from each other. Sweet story that will take no longer than an afternoon."
2,"Sandra Brown, Not At Her Best","Sandra Brown is my absolute favorite author, but this story just was plain out bad. I did not connect with the characters at all and the story line was a bit unemotional. Most of her short books are filled with so much passion that it leaves you wanting more, however, this book was not like that at all. Save your time and pick up another book!"
1,Sex scenes can't make up for boring love story.,"From the first couple of pages in The Thrill of Victory, you can tell what is going to happen at the end of the book. While this isn't a bad thing, (it's a romance novel after all) I really found the book disappointing. Nothing ever seemed to happen between the characters that was interesting (even their constant verbal battles got tiring) and the love story that happens near the end is stupid and rushed. No one would actually do any of these things (this is even outrageous for a romance book) and Stevie is written as a woman who is only there to make female readers root for her. The writing isn't very good and the book seems to add on about 60 or 70 pages that don't really belong to, or contribute anything to the story. The steamy 4 or 5 page sex scenes are well written, but the rest of the story is not. Not recommended at all, unless you are looking for a book to make fun of."
5,funny,"Amelia is an idiot. She reads things or hears figures of speech and takes everything so literally that she ends up making a fool of her self. In result you learn nothing but you just learn to laugh and learn not to be like Amelia. Reading a book and laughing sometimes is all you need, so enjoy this book!"
5,Light of Guidance.,As a french speaking person I didnt had any troubles to read this very interesting book about Islam! A Friend of mine send it to me and it was like a new Univers of knowledge for me as I wanted to increase my faith and wanted more informations.There is some questions&answers to see if You did understand well what you read and some very well explanation (in schemas). I strongly recommand this book to any selflearner and may 'Our Creator' rewards Mr Sarwar for giving his contribution to some inexperienced person like me and those who are helping others like this Friend of mine...
4,large lthr hobo review,"This bag works very well for me, whether to travel by air or by car. I deliberately scaled down from a briefcase-size bag and find that it still holds my allowable toiletries, passport, Filofax, camera, wallet and other essentials of travelling life. The exterior cell phone is handy and does a good job of keeping the phone IN the pocket. The black leather looks dressy enough for most evening events and is sufficiently sturdy to withstand weather challenges. When this bag is updated, I would encourage the designers to do 2 things:1. put ""feet"" on the bottom of the exterior2. to make the interior fabric more durable (the interior pocket had to be reglued w/in 3 days of my receiving the bag)"
5,Perfect match for Pentax K-01 and Pentax Q w/lenses!,I bought these to use with Pentax K-01 and am happy to report that the K-01 w/40xs lens fits perfect with room on the side for an extra 2x batteries if needed! Case is really nice and well made .. it's a great bargain!!P.S. This case will also nicely fit a Pentax Q w/8.5 prime attached + up to 3x additional lenses on the other side of the divider!Take out the bottom liner in either case as you won't need it - use the extra space (height).
4,A solid guide to working with ACE,"I found the book to give a solid introduction into the world of using ACE to build real world network application. I find the book to be more useful for ACE novices but it also includes material for ACE veterans.I enjoyed the evolution of the sample application through the use of the ACE features, and think it is a good way to introduce its ideas."
3,Better coverage than Volume I,When I bought the second volume I thought it will explain some more details about Task. Mainly covers Reactor and Service classes same as Vol I. Web site gives more information than these text books. Examples are not in detail. I have all three books( Vol I&II and patterns). I found the pattern book the best among the three.
4,c++ network programming,"If you want to learn C++ network programming architecture , design patterns and want the source code to be portable , this is the book for you . If you cant afford to have your own copy at least suggest your company to buy it . If your in C++ network programming and dont use ACE , think again , you might be reinventing the wheel."
5,So you thought you knew how to envision information...,"I recieved this book along with the most excellent (almost a companion book) Visual Display of Quantitative Information, from my CEO. Since I work a lot with numbers and he had been stressing the importance of presenting data clearly and concisely.I feel that, this book, more than being a guide to envisioning information is a book to appreciate charts.Very beatifully produced, and a book which must reside on the bookshelf of any person working with numbers and information"
3,"Nice to look at, but little content to read.","The text is disjointed and dense, but the pictures are terrific. It's almost a coffee table book. Nice to look at, but little content to read."
3,Sorry but it was not that inspiring,I think I have a good eye for illustrating. I have an engineering degree and have spent a lot of time at a drafting table. I bought this book to help me with preparing exhibits for public meetings and such. I found the book could not hold my interest. It went to a used book store.
5,Exquisite,"Tufte is a genius, and this, the first of his series (of three), is an exquisite testimony to visual design. Wonderful for brainstorming or just feasting the eyes. No designer should be without these books."
2,Not Impressed,"If you're a graphic designer looking for practical content on how to better present your infographics - look elsewhere. The book was filled with beautiful, but useless information. If you're after information theory, the book hits the mark - but for almost $50, it's hardly worth it."
2,Don't get the Hype,Don't get it why this book is so popular. The visual examples that are given are hard to understand without reading the text. I would think that a book that explains how information is envisioned would be self explanatory trough the visuals in the book. I would not recommend to anyone who is superficially interested in design. If you are a professional designer it could maybe be something for you.
4,Read it again. Then again - you'll catch on.,"I'm a big fan of Tufte's work and so was, at first, sort of disappointed the first time through this book. But each time I reread it I find found more and more I can use. The text runs from subversive to straightforward, but it's the wonderful illustrations you'll love!I find places to apply Tufte's few basic guidelines every single time I transmit information. The worst I can say is this book is super instead of stupendous. I'm happy I own it, and I'm never, ever gonna give it away."
3,"Nice book, but not what I needed.","I am a programmer by trade and wanted to see different ways of displaying information to people electronically. I didnt feel that this book helped me as much as I hoped. It is a well written book, the quality is nice, but I needed something different."
3,Nice Pictures,"This wasn't the easiest book to read. Tufte spends a bit too much energy attempting to make the tone of the book academic, rather than getting to the point. The concepts are pretty simplistic though, once you do absorb the information. There are some interesting illustrations. All in all, I wouldn't reccomend this for casual rading."
2,Info,"Im not too happy with this book. Amazon delievered it on time and in good piece, but i really hate this book. it feels like I am reading a book with ADD"
5,All evidence is not equally accessible to the mind.,"Tuft's book demonstrate that information is not knowledge or wisdom until it is accessible and well understood. Beautifully, presented by a master teacher. Applying Prof. Tufte's methods helps improve communication by enriching visual presentations in ways that the mind readily apprehends. Tufte really dislikes PowerPoints propensity to truncate presentation data! He makes a good case for the proposition that the inherent communication weaknesses of PowerPoint-style presentations lead to the engineering failures that caused the Challenger disaster."
4,Incredible First Novel,I can't wait to read more of John Ford's work. Bonk on the Head was a riveting read that succeeded in doing what all great literature should do......make one think!
3,It seems that theres a stone missing,"The ring is cute and delicate but when I got this belly button ring I got disappointed when I noticed that at the top at the butterfly, theres a curved empty space that you cannot really see in the pictures, but when you have it on, it looks like there's a stone missing, but it just the design. Anyway, I guess I should have noticed it before I bought it. The"
3,"Easy to setup, works well.","I bought and installed this unit a month ago. After getting the wiring diagram from Bulldog website, it was somewhat easy to install this unit in my Hyundai Accent (a beginner might take more time). A lot of time was spent on looking and checking for the right wire to hook up to the device. Since this kit is make for both diesel and unlead cars; There is a lot of wires you won't need for your car. So don't bother to find all the wires in your car. If you run into any problem, check Bulldog's FAQ on their website, or you can call or email them.The manual was misleading for my car. It asked me to get relay to hook up to the parking light. But I was able to successfully hook up the parking light without the relay. And it is working fine for me for three weeks. The range is poor; It was definitely less than .25 mile."
2,plastic handle does not cover the sharp metal fully,"This same item is also sold at bed, bath, beyond and even walmart. The same problem in all three stores for over a year now so the manu must have made a very big batch. The plastic handle does not fully cover the metal in the handle. So, the metal sticks out past the plastic handle and it's sharp and very uncomfortable to hold. I would wait until the manufacture makes a new batch of these before buying, but because Amazon uses fulfillment, they can not physically look at the exact product before you buy it, so I'm not sure how you'll know."
3,Beware....,Beware of the serrated part of the knives! They are sharp! They could have been smoothed a bit. Have cut myself twice just washing them! Just saying that they are great for cutting bt be very careful!
5,"Good Quality, Look Nice","Great quality product for the money! I bought similar flatware a while back from a big box store for about the same price, but these are heavier, more solid. They look nice with the Sango Nova Blue Dinnerware. Highly recommend for everyday flatware."
1,inferior quality,I purchased this item to replace a similar pattern bought 15 years ago which was made in Korea. The Cambridge Silversmith Flatware made in China is very much inferior to my older set. After less than 1 year in service the silver of the handles has partly worn off and has revealed plastic underneath it. I am concerned that the flaking off of the silver coating is a health hazard. Do stay away from this item - not worth the money.
4,A little flimsy but nice,"These are nice looking, but they aren't really sturdy. The knives especially are easy to bend out of shape. For the price though, they work well enough.One thing I will say is they have some crazy packaging on them. I don't know if this is par for the course with silverware sets, but it was a lot of work to dig these things out of their box."
2,Discolored within a Month,These were horrible. The tips on the handle discolored almost immediately. I am very disappointed with this product.
1,DVD manufactured with defective equipment,"I received this DVD as BRAND NEW, FACTORY SEALED and the disc's surface appeared to be perfect (no scratches), but the last three DVD chapters (10,11 and 12 ... of a total of 12 chapters) stuttered and skipped and pixelized and froze then reverted back to the DVD's main menu -- it did this again and again and again. I never did get to see the final 15 minutes of the film. The DVD would not play on TWO different DVD players AND my computer's DVD drive, all three of which are clean and functioning perfect with my other DVD's. Therefore I suspect that the manufacturer (Echo Bridge Home Entertainment Company) is using inferior or defective manufacturing equipment. The film itself is ""B-grade"" or less. Cheesy acting. Cheesy writing. Cheesy plot. RottenTomatoes.com describes it as an ""uninspired, dull action film"" and says of 67 reviews, only 25% liked it. This DVD gets tossed into the trash can. Waste of my time and money."
5,Love it,"Dont use it a hole since I work on bigger trucks all day but when I do need it, it works awsome. Seen others go for way more which are the same thing but you cant beat the price."
5,Tongue in Cheek,"Bravo to Walter Liedtke for his sense of humor, see below. The fact that 17 out of 24 did not understand his subtle comments on himself, he did write most of the book, is testimony as to lack of discernment of those who read these reviews. I have heard his lecture on the exhibition and all he says is absolutely true. Actually, his comments on himself are rather modest."
2,Bowhunting Whitetail Deer by Monte Burch,"I purchased this book some time ago. This book as a bowhunters first exposure is pretty weak. Comparing it to many other Bowhunting books, it doesn't do enough to inform the beginner what is necessary to be successful.I have read Greg Miller's ""Aggressive Whitetail Hunting"" and this book doesn't hold a candle.I give this book ""Pocket Guide To Bowhunting Whitetail Deer"" and BIG BIG thumbs down."
3,basic info,this is a good basic information book for first time bonsai growers. start you kids on this one. i wouldn't recommend this book for anyone with experience.
4,Bonsai Tree,"Tree appears in great shape. Some damadge to the small man , but glue repaired him. Book on ""takeing care"" is essential."
3,Kind of Dull,"While the book offers information on some indoor and partially indoor species, I was looking for a book with more species information. The pictures were not all that great and the book in general appeared boring. It was more concise that what I was looking for. The book lacked many species that I was interested in, such as: Camphor, Baobab, Banyan, Coffee, Bald Cypress, and Buttonwood. I have ordered Bonsai in your Home: An Indoor Grower's Guide, and hopefully that will have the information I need."
2,Don't do it,"The book is not even good for the amateur in bonsai. It was a lack of information and most of the bonsai look like pseudo-bonsai. Truly, if you are looking for something I will recomend the Ken Norman book."
3,Bonasi Book,I am new to Bonasilooking for book on alothave bought 3 books and none of them talk aboutthe plants I have wish someone would do a book on Bonasi beging for dummies
1,You can judge this book by it's cover,"This may be the worst Bonsai Book ever written. The tree on the front cover is a prime example of what a Bonsai tree is not supposed to look like. The tree is a young Ficus with no taper to the trunk. The branches grow straight up and the style is all wrong. Most importantly are the horrible scars on the branches from leaving the wires on too long. The book is very generic and really doesn't give enough information to create a heathly and well trained tree. If you have shown enough interest in Bonsai to pursue more information on the Art of Bonsai then you have already outgrown this book. Avoid this book, and buy a tree instead."
5,Excellent source for beginners,"The first half of this book focuses on beginner bonsai techniques, and goes over styling, training, tools, pruning, etc. The second half of this book has 1-2 information-packed pages each on many of the most popular trees used for bonsai. While my favorite bonsai book for beginners would have to be Bonsai (101 Essential Tips), this is the runner up for best read. Highly recommended for beginners."
3,Pine Wood Derby Truck,The truck was deliver fast. The truck was a good shape and came with wheels and axels. The axels did need to be sanded down but they all do. The wheels were not polished. The truck was not as fast as the cars.
1,Save your money,"It's too bad they did'n publish my first reveiw on volume 1 of this set of three dvd's. I'll have to tone it down like I did for volume 2. These dvd's are a complete waste of your money. There are so many places and books available for AE that have taken the time to give you complete information written by professionals and supply you with footage to follow along. I purchased these dvd'd because of the 5 star rating written by obvious friends of the producer. If there was a lower rating than 1 star, believe me I would have given it."
3,RESTORATION ?,"Not a bad restoration but not the best either. What about the white mark in the top left hand corner of "" CHARLIE CHAN IN PARIS"". It keeps you transfixed to this blob for over an hour. Highly amusing. Before and after restoration comparison very funny also. Is someone pulling our leg. All the very best from Craig in Oz."
4,Chan fans will love it!!!!!,"I found it to be really entertaining, It's great having the Warner oland Charlie Chan films out on DVD! Chan fans will love it!!! and those who are new to the films will be charmed and entertained by these four great Movies."
