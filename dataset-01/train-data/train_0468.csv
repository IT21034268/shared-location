4,Great seat!,"We have this seat as past of our Pliko travel system in the Chesapeake pattern. We have loved it so far. Our daughter looks very secure in it. The pattern is very sharp too! The base is very easy to install in the car and the seat snaps easily into the base. The only bad part is that this seat shouldn't be used if your baby is over 20 pounds, which is less than most other infant seats."
2,The only good thing is its safety rating!,"We have been using both the infant seat and it's matching stroller now for three months and I am anxiously awaiting my 3-month old son to outgrow it! The only positive thing I can say about this carseat is that is is definitely SAFE. However, it is much heavier than other brands and because of it's super-thick padding, it is hard to get my 15-pound son in and out of it. He's 25 inches long and just about reaches the edge of the seat. This carseat is also VERY heavy, and more importantly it does NOT have any fabric or anything on the handle with which to hold on. This makes it necessary to hold the carrier in the crease of your arm. I do NOT recommend this carrier. The stroller is also not one I would recommend. It is very compact, which is its only positive attribute, but it is difficult to snap-in the infant carrier to it. I will NOT be using our Peg carrier nor stroller with baby #2."
5,Great for Smaller Babies!!!!,"This car seat is great for small babies. My daughter is almost eleven pounds and still fits in her seat. It is probably due to the extra padding that is in it. I have read that it is heavy with bigger babies in it, but what car seat isn't?The only down fall to this car seat is the handle... I do have some trouble moving it down (esp. when the car seat is attached to the stroller). Also, this car seat does not fit in a shopping cart like others do.Other then that this car seat is great."
5,Great product,"This is a great seat. It's easy to latch in your baby (once you get the hang of it) and get a good, snug fit. Our son would fall asleep in his car seat almost immediately every time we drove anywhere. I never had any trouble taking the seat on and off the base, or snapping it into the pliko stroller. Also a huge plus, it is compact enough to fit in smaller cars -- we have a vw beetle. The only drawback for us is that this seat is only for rear-facing use, and really is only suitable for newborns and smaller infants. Though peg perego says it can be used from birth to a year, at six months our son outgrew it."
1,Hated it!,"We bought two of these carseats before the baby arrived. We thought we were getting the BEST for her. We were so upset when she CRIED AND CRIED every time we took her anywhere in the car! After six weeks of this, my mother finally suggested that this carseat might just be too snug and uncomfortable for the baby. My husband bought a Graco infant seat, and our lives changed for the better! Our baby was VERY UNCOMFORTABLE in this very snug, small carseat. Don't spend the extra money on this when you can get a better carseat for less."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I have twin boys so I have two of these car seats. The boys just had their 4 month check up and their pediatrician told me that the car seats can only be used up until the babies reach 26.5"" - how disappointing because the seats are so expensive! I had thought I'd be able to keep them until the boys turned one. And the real disappointment is that I'll no longer be able to snap them in and out of the stroller - I'll have to take both of them out of their new car seats into their huge Perego stroller seats. So now we have to purchase infant/toddler car seats.Now that the warm weather is upon us, I've also noticed that the babies sweat a lot in these seats, even if they're wearing minimal clothing."
3,"good, but not great.","I purchased this car seat as a travel system for my daughter in February, 2003. The stroller is great, I had the same one for my son back in 1998 but it was only the stroller at that time. The car seat is great for newborns, it's very padded and keeps them very safe and snugged. The latch system is very easy, I didn't have any problems installing anything. The bad thing is that you won't use it for very long and it practically still looks new when the baby outgrows it so it's really not worth the money but since I purchased it as a travel system, the price was much better than purchasing the car seat alone. I would recommend buying the stroller by itself and purchasing an infant/toddler carseat instead. Also, if you live in a cold weather state, it's very uncomfortable to put a 15 pound baby with their jacket or coat in this carseat. Not worth the money at all."
1,Skip this one,"We purchased this seat for my son because we liked the other Peg Perego products but my infant son cried every time we put him in the seat. It was impossible to keep the belts open to put him in - we had to drag the belts and buckles out from under him. He was hot and uncomfortable and hated car rides. I switched him to my older Evenflo seat and he loves it, naps in it and likes car rides. I share this with everyone I know and hope others can skip such a costly mistake."
1,Extremely Inconvenient,"Don't waste your money. This carrier is very deep and narrow which causes my baby to overheat easily and makes it very difficult to get her out of, which causes an otherwise calm baby to scream. It is also heavy and difficult to get in and out of the car. The sun guard is so short that it's useless. The seat is so small that I'm sure my baby will out grow it in a matter of weeks, not months. Two of my girlfriends purchased the same seat and have the same opinion. Reconsider buying this and look at Graco-they are much easier to deal with!"
2,Nice Quality but Much Too Small,"I purchased this car seat that fits nicely into the Peg Prego stroller. I was extremely disappointed to see that my baby out grew the shoulder area in less than 1.5 months. He was only 12 lbs and 23"" long when he was no longer able to fit in it. I have been using my sister's Evenflo car seat and it is much more comfortable. I realize that safety is one of the reasons for the snug fit but if the baby cannot fit in it or if he/she cries everytime you put them in it, it really doesn't justify the purchase. Therefore, I have a brand new $... car seat in my basement that I will probably never use again."
2,Fabric Too Hot,"I really like Peg Perego products, & believe they are of good quality, but the fabric on this carseat makes the baby way too hot! I had to have my mom make a cotton insert for it to help keep baby cool & that has made a big difference."
2,Hot!,We bought this carseat and matching stroller. We love the stroller. Our son is uncomfortable and hot in this carseat. We have recently purchased the Britex Marathon. Hopefully he will be more comfortable in the Britex carseat.
4,Good while it lasted,"I chose this carseat based on its quality and style. I especially liked the fact that I could easily remove the carrier from my car and attach it to the Peg Perego stroller! My daughter never complained about being in it; both car rides and mall strolls were great. Also, the base was very easy to install into different cars. My only difficulties: i dont know if it is because my daughter is growing, but i've had some difficulties tightening the base to my backseat lately. Also, because she's gained weight its gotten too heavy to use as an 'infant' carrier. But up until this time, this seat has worked very well."
5,We love it,"My husband and i truly love this car seat. We haven;t had any issues with overheating altough our son was born in cold January. He was a big boy weighing in at 9.4 lbs, and he is quiet comfortable in this seat. Now at 12lbs we are still satisfied with our purchase. Saftey comes first and if that means he only uses it for the first 3 months of his life, so be it. We would certainly reccomend it to others."
5,well worth the $$$,No question this is a great car seat for us. With a child that has always hated the process of getting strapped in it is a lifesaver not having to complete the task with each stop. I truely don't find it heavy even with my little one reaching 15 lbs. I welcome the workout. We have the venezia stroller as well and are certainly getting our monies worth. I absolutely love the system and dread the day we can no longer use it. Even if it is only for 6 months at least it was a pleasant 6 months.
2,MY BABY HATES IT!,"MY DAUGHTER IS ONLY THREE MONTHS OLD AND BARELY HAS ROOM IN THERE. SHE CAN'T STRETCH AND SCREAMS. SHE ALWAYS SWEATS IN HER SEAT. WE WENT TO BUY A BIGGER CONVERTABLE SEAT BUT SHE WAS SWIMMING IN THAT ONE. I WON'T BUY ANOTHER INFANT CARSEAT, THIS WAS PRICEY AS IS. PLUS A PAIN TO SNAP OUT OF THE BASE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BASE. BEST BET LOOK INTO OTHERS AND HAVE A FEW BUCKS. I LOVE PEREGO STUFF BUT THIS IS HORRIBLE!"
1,Not user or baby friendly,"(1) My newborn baby was only 7 lbs when he was born and was very cramped in this chair. He will likely grow out of it by the 4th month. (2) Easy to intall, but very difficult to adjust. (3) The fabric on the cushion of the buckle just fell apart...torn from the seam today! (4) Canopy does not pull over enough to shield the baby from elements. (5) Harness clip very clumsy to use.My friends have the Graco Snugride (I don't work for them) and it's much easier to use and seem much more comfy for the baby."
2,Too hot and Too heavy,"This infant car seat is very secure and probably a very safeseat. It has a nice appearance and the fabric is pretty. Itwas a wonderful fit for bringing home my 6lb 8oz grandson, butit is very heavy to use as a carrier. My grandson overheats init, and he can not move in it. He is now 3 months old andscreams constantly whenever we take him out in the car. He isonly 13 lbs but seems to be miserable in it. Hate to put himinto a convertible seat at so young an age, but we think itwill be necessary as I cannot see the $$ for another carrier forso short a time period."
5,A Much Better Buy,We purchased this carseat for our daughter after much research and even buying and returning another brand. This carseat is safer than American Carseats because the standards are higher in Europe for Carseats. The thread count on the straps makes this a great buy not only because they are safer but they also don't curl up like other brands. This carseat does not weigh 25 lbs. like some people state. It is slightly heavier than others but not enough to tell. It goes awesome with the stroller because it is lightweight and can travel in smaller spaces better. LOVE IT!
3,Outgrew the seat at 4 months.,"I loved this seat when my son 2 & 3 months old, but noticed his feet were starting to dangle over the ends at 4.5 months. i couldn't believe it. He was 25 inces tall and outgrew the seat. I took him/seat into babies r us and they agreed that he needed a new seat. I loved using the Pliko travel system but had to buy a new seat much sooner than expected."
5,Peg VS. Graco! What CS's 2004 Baby Products really says!,"Consumer Reports has a book that rates the baby products that are most commonly used. The 2004 edition (printed in February of 2004) clearly states on page 109 that the Graco SNUGRIDE is number one, BUT not by much! The only difference is Graco received and Excellent in belt (crash protection) and latch (fit to vehicle) whereas Peg received a score of Very Good. These are the only differences listed."
3,Not that great for the money,I found that the seat is heavier then others and the baby sweats alot in it. Others ive used top of the line also didnt.I am a mother of 7 year old twins and 5 yr old and a 5 month old. I know about car seats and strollers.i have a perego stroller culla carriage with all the attchments and the seat is one of them. Over all the system I have I love it was (...) worth every penny..... The infant seat so so...
3,child out grows fast,"My child is 2 1/2 months and fits in it perfect at eleven pounds, if she grows anymore, which she will, she will be hanging over the edges of the seat. The seat is small compare to other infant seats and child will not be able to use as long as a normal infant seat."
2,"Just OK, buy something else","very disappointed in this seat - the same complaints as the other reviewers: heavy, my son sweats so much in this seat and has outgrown it at 6 months. For our first son we used a much less expensive Graco and found it a better value for the money."
4,"Great, but sweaty!","Cozy fit, reliable. Baby sweat in the seat often, though. I'd still buy it again."
4,Could be better...,"My husband (MD) and I (RN) both work in ERs, and wanted to be sure that our son got the safest seat available. After much research, this was a close second behind the Britax Marathon convertible. We mainly bought it because baby boy would be transferrable in this seat from car to stroller or house without much disruption if he was sleeping. He fits in the seat just fine at 4-1/2 months and 15#. It is a warm, snug seat, but it's still wintertime (supposedly!) in Seattle. My biggest complaint is that the ""Warning"" tag inside the seat has been fraying for weeks now. We're buying the Britax soon."
1,worst experience - became housebound,"My worst decision was not buying a new car seat. The second worst decision was buying this one to begin with. Trying to buy only the best for my son, and knowing that Peg Perego products are highly rated, we opted for this seat.We could never get him comfortable in it. He cried and screamed every time he was in it. It was painful to take him anywhere. The straps were impossible to adjust. He was always hot and he outgrew it before he was 4 months old (and way before the 20 lb, 26 inch limit). Once we got him into his Britax Roundabout convertible, I was able to go out of the house again. He actually laughed during the first trip."
5,The Book Was Good!,"This book was good it's about two orphans, Pip and his sister Kelsey and their Christmas wish is to have a Mom and Dad and they have selected a lady named Ryan Clark who owns a Doll shop and a guy named Max Monroe and they set about in trying to make their wish come true."
4,Despues de tanto tiempo.......,"Mi pimer contacto con Garbarek fue en 1976, escuche de una sentada los albums (todavia en vinil): DIS con Ralph Towner y FOLK SONGS alternando con Charlie Haden y Egberto Gismonti, para mi fue toda una revelacion, me parecia una musica con un sello especial, de ahi en adelante fui un fiel seguidor de Garbarek, me parece un musico que lo puedes identificar, porque Garbarek solo suena a Garbarek. Pasaron 5 largos anos sin noticias discograficas y ahora me encuentro con IN PRAISE OF DREAMS, la verdad, esperaba una obra mucho mas elaborada, con mas produccion, con mas elementos de novedad (musicos nuevos, sonidos distintos, etc. Me gusta este album pero la espera fue demasiado larga para el producto que entrega. Tal vez me forme demasiadas expectativas acerca de este album. Salud."
4,Jan is back!,"For an amateur listener like me, there is not much I can say except that I enjoy listening to this new CD by Jan Garbarek."
4,Great for a first album,I remeber seeing Joey Edwin perform live and loved his voice! His voice on the album was just as beautiful. The words are simple but pure. I also enjoyed the introduction with the guitar. Can't wait for his next album and wish him all the luck in music biz! I hope his extraordinary talent will be widely discovered.
5,A fresh beginning,"It's not very easy to do a prequel movie,(ask George Lucas), so I was very surprised that Full Moon was able to pull this off. I tip my hat to Charles Band. This movie delivers. As for the DVD itself, no surprise that Full Moon gives you your money's worth. The behind the scenes features in the Video Zone make all these DVDs so much better. The major studios need to wake up and realize movie fans desire these ""little"" extras. Finally, these new retro puppets are cool!"
3,Retro Puppet Master,"If you love the traditional Puppet Master movies and their adventures. You will love Retro Puppet Master, as you explore the history of the puppets and discover how it all began. However if you have never seen a Puppet Master movie, Retro Puppet Master will give you a reason to, as you see the history you will feel a need to explore the great adventures the puppets have in their other movies."
1,Sheer Junk (and I love junk movies!),"I remember fondly renting the originals in the Puppet Master series when I was younger--now, years later available on DVD I was intrigued by this ""new"" entry in the series. Wow...what a major dissapointment! This movie is terrible...let me qualify myself by saying that I enjoy bad films, Plan 9, Astro Zombies, bad horror, etc. but his movie is BORING! They spent all their time on a boring melodrama about Toulon as a young guy. The actor who plays him is a boring, ""pretty-boy"" whose french accent makes you want to string him up and make him dance! The only good thing about this movie is the hot chick.... The puppets look awesome but no CGI or stop-motion from David Alan just boring real puppet action which is fine for a 5-year old but these things are supposed to be alive. Please don't waste one dime on this one, if you're curious like I was simply rent the VHS. Be warned!"
3,Unimpressive,"I was really expecting alot more from this movie. I have seen all the Puppet Master movies, Three being my favorite. With this one only being just over 60 mins long, it didn't give itself time to develop fully into what Charles Band should have wanted. No stop motion really made the puppets look just like puppets, which I felt took away from the movie. IT all looked too staged, the puppets really did looked controlled by a person. I truly hope that Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys is alot better. Especially after Dollman vs. Demonic Toys (what a blah movie). I must say though, I love all Full Moon movies in one fashion or the other, and will continue to collect them."
5,A REAL ADVENTURE,"I've never seen a Puppetmaster before but this was really cool. The characters were very interesting and it reminded me of a dark Titanic. The sets were cool and the effects were just right. The young Toulon had a real mysterious prescence and I loved how his tone of voice was so hush and sensitive. It was like you wanted to know him and understand his feelings. He was so boyish, and really was attractive. Some parts were a little slow, but it pays off at the end"
4,BACK TO THE FUTURE/ RETRO,"THIS WAS A FUN FILM! IT HAD THE OLD GOTHIC LOOK TO IT, AND HAD THE FRANKENSTEINISH FEEL TO IT.THE YOUNG TOULON WAS SO COOL UNDER PRESSURE WHILE THE GIRL(ILSA) WAS SO AGRESSIVE. I LOVED THE OLD THEATRE AS WELL AS THE SNOW. I FELT AS IF I WAS IN A LAND FAR FAR AWAY. A FRIEND SAID IT LACKED HORROR AND BLOOD. I THOUGHT IT WAS REFRESHING TO SEE A REAL LOVE STORY INVOLVED IN A HORROR MOVIE. IT WAS AN OLD TIME HORROR MOVIE AND I LOVED IT. IT WAS ORIGINAL AND HEARTFELT. THE DARKNESS OF IT BROUGHT ME IN AND TOULON HAD A GREAT APPEAL OF PLAYING THE UNKNOWN FIGURE. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT FOR A DATE MOVIE! BEST OF LUCK IN EGYPT AND PARIS 1902!"
1,"BIG HYPE, BIG FLOP","I HAVE SEEN ALL THE PUPPET MASTER MOVIES AND LOVED EVERYONE OF THEM, BUT I HAVE TO SAY RETRO PUPPET MASTER WAS HORRIBLE. I WAITED 4 MONTHS TO SEE THIS MOVIE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A COMPLETE WASTE. SURE THEY GET THE STORY ACROSS, BUT I LIKE TO SEE SOME KILLING AND ACTION. THIS MOVIE SUCKED. RENT IT, DONT BUY IT."
1,Full Moon Picture's Worst!,"This film needed alot of work.When I rented it I only watched it once since it was so stupid and non violent.Puppet Master 1,2,3,4,5,and 6 are all good but this is just plain and stupid.The film's special effects stunk and so did the cast this film.The Puppet Master Series I think was Fullmoon's greatest series next to Subspecies but this film broke the best series.Don't let the cover fool you.They look so mean and bad but when you first see them they are not mean and angry like the first Puppet Master films.I think FullMoonPictures should have never made this since it doesn't have Horror,suspence,drama,or even love.I rather watch Puppet Master 6 than this one.Hey,Fullmoon don't make a film like this again or prepare to suffer.This film really is for kids not teens and adults.Kids may like this since it has a Fantasy side but I hated it."
5,Retro Puppet Master,"Movies like this, which don't fall into the big budget release category, are a genre unto themselves. This is not your typical, slick buckets-of-blood Hollywood horror thriller. There's a wonderful sense of intimacy and as one reviewer has noted, real craftsmanship about this rather scarey movie. It has a charm of its own. It also has a memorable film score by John Massari, a wonderful composer who deserves much more critical acclaim. The score is understated and subtle, rather than a lot of overdone, in-your-face movie soundtracks. It draws you in and keeps you riveted; it complements this little gem of a film."
4,a dark fairy tale,"No gore here! It's largely bloodless - but I'm a huge fan of this horror series and I enjoyed Retro Puppet Master. It's ""quaint"" and I know many Puppet fans and gore-hounds won't like it but the ""fairy tale"" quality of this one won me over. Guy Rolfe tells the tale of how once upon a time the young Toulon was granted the magic to bring his puppets to life. This is such a charming little movie that some horror fans will love it and others will hate it. I love all types of horror movies (including the bloodier early Puppet Masters) and I *loved* this one."
4,"TALK ABOUT ""GETTING UNDER YOUR SKIN""","Very good CD that combines 80s-era REM-style college rock, with an old-school country-twang. It's the feel-good album of the summer!"
5,This Sister knows she can write and has a way with words..,"Anfra-- You Are My Sister had me up all night. I found myself talking out loud, laughing and crying until it was dawn. And when I finished it I found myself thinking and wanting to make changes in how I view my life and my children.You Are My Sister is a much needed book for women."
4,To All Sisters,"Anfra, express her views on life's many embers: AIDS, sex, politics, spiritual, how to raise your children, meditation and more.I especially like ""A Tribute To African-American Authors"" where she uses the titles of various author books to get her point across.A great reality check book."
5,Every woman should have this book!!!!!,"""YOU ARE MY SISTER"" is a wonderful collection of inspirational writings for women. This book makes you think about where you are spiritually...makes you think about where you are personally in your life....and gives you a means of bringing your life's purpose into existence. Most importantly, Anfra addresses issues that ALL women come against, regardless of race, background, or economic status. Men.....get this book for your wives, mothers, sisters, and girlfriends. It will Bless the lives of anyone who reads it. Order your copy today!!!! You will not be disappointed."
5,Do yourself a favor and read this book,"I was browsing through Afro Books in Memphis, looking for something to inspire me, and the owner suggested that I read You Are My Sister. She said that women were buying the book so fast that she couldn't keep it in stock. After reading the back of the book, and glancing through some of the pages some of the topics jumped out at me and I couldn't stop reading. Needless to say I took the book home and finished it that night. It was awesome, Like I was reading my own life story or sitting down with a therapist and having things explained to me on why I've made so many mistakes.You Are My Sister has the answers to our lessons of heartache and pain and so eloquently explains why we make so many bad choices."
5,I had the pleasure to meet Anfra,"I friend of mine suggested this book to me and I borrowed her copy. I was so inspired that I shamelessly made copies of messages and passed them out in the office. Well a few weeks later Anfra show up at the office and I felt so shame and honored to meet her at the same time. I felt like I knew her, becasue her words spoke the truth about my life. It was a pleasure meeting her, and she's just like any other women..""for real."" Please buy her book, every women in the office bought it while she was there. It will change your life."
5,"Savannah, GA loves this book","I bought this book in Savannah, GA at a Literary Retreat. I took it home and my daughter took it to her nail salaon and women went crazy over the book so I had to order serveral more copies as gifts. Anfra, please keep writing and the women in Savannah will keep reading. You Are My Sister is so inspiring and encouraging."
5,Love it..,I keep You Are My Sister with me at all times.. it's like a Bible for women. No matter what I'm feeling or going through there's a message for me to read and be uplifted. The messages are so touching and heart-felt that you'll get inspired. When I finished reading the book I wanted to go out and buy another book by Anfra. Please don't make me wait too long.
5,5 STARS IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS BOOK OR THE AUTHOR,"I recently attended a Literary Retreat in Savannah, GA and all I can say is WOW! Anfra was awesome with her humorous way of teaching others how to live spiritually. We all wanted more and was blessed to have her as a facilitator.Anfra you touched my life along with everyone who met you. Keep doing what you're doing and God will continue to use your life experiences to teach others. I took the test that you passed out on being spiritually bankrupt and I found out that I need to spend my money and my time doing things of a more postive nature. You made me think about my life in ways I've never thought of before. Thank you Sister."
4,"Not great, not half bad","The photography in the book is excellent. Lots of pictures of nicely prepared sushi. The pictures alone offer great ideas. It is divided into well defined sections that do make sense. However, the information provided in the book is not as simple and didactical as you might expect from the title. It almost seems as if the information was pieced together from different sources and nobody took the time to proofread it. It's not impossible to understand as stated before. Beginners will benefit from this book, but maybe it shouldn't be your sole source for sushi info."
1,Don't even think about it,If you are new to sushi making don't even think about buying this book. I was frustrated to the point of killing somebody.
3,Coasting...,"As many of the previous reviews have noted, Parker is coasting. He found a formula and he's sticking to it. It's a pretty good formula, but by now, the reader knows how it's supposed to go. Not a lot of suspense but the mystery is a reasonable one, hinging on the stupidity of the defendent in the case, Mary Smith, and it's a little less predictable than Parker's last few. Hawk is there, so is Martin Quirk, displaying some blatant police brutality, which I don't think we've seen before. Susan, of course. Pearl, the wonder dog...my biggest problem with this one is the dialogue. Parker used to write snappy, dead on prose. Here, the conversations are stilted, the observations trite. Real people don't talk like this...but I've stuck with Parker for a lot of years, and it's going to take more than this one to make me stop reading him. I think from now on, however, I'm going to wait for the paperback."
3,Reliable Fare,"This is the typical Spenser novel - same great characters: Spenser, Susan and Hawk + good story line and humor. Parker does smart tough guy dialogue as well as anyone. Spenser's self-deprecating humor always rings true.So why only three stars? There is nothing to distinguish this book from any of the other Spenser novels. The plot was fairly good, but so are all of the books in this series. It is -as are all the Spenser novels - goos light reading."
3,SPENSER ** BOOK TWENTY NINE,"I am a big fan of Robert B. Parker and the Spenser series. This one book, twenty nine, WIDOW'S WALK is far from his best. Even with Hawk and Silverman, it just falls short. Spenser's client is totally unlikeable as are most of the characters. It was just sort of mechanical for me. Not enough interest in the folks driving the story. HIGHLY RECOMMEND series, the book, not so much."
1,ABSOLUTELY THE WORST!!,"I have read every Robert Parker book ever written - I love Robert Parker. However, this was his worst book ever. There were so many characters in this book that I couldn't keep track of them all and finally got so frustrated that I didn't care who they were. Of course, being a die hard Robert Parker fan, I read it to the bitter end, but it wasn't worth the effort it took to turn the pages."
3,So-so,"It has been a long, fallow time for Spenser. This book is a minor uptick. Its strength is the dialogue. It is more than time for both Pearl & Susan to be put to sleep."
2,Intaglio,"The best part of this novel is the dialogue, some of it, although I find Hawk a bit tiresome and overdone. The worst part is the contrived plot. Perhaps there are too many dead bodies, to the point that the initial murder loses its importance and focus.Spenser is not my favorite detective, I might add. He's tough like Mike Hammer, smart talking like Lawrence Block heroes, egotistical, boastful, and never loses a fight. A few flaws might help him.This novel started to drag about halfway and I could scarcely wait to finish it, not to find out whodunit but to be dunwithit."
2,Average to not so good,This is my 2d Spenser novel. At first I found him interesting and I even said complex. Huh. The book character is definitely more nuanced than the tv character but almost everything is more nuanced than tv.I still enjoyed Spenser and Hawk but now find Susan is just a bit too annoying. The plot was okay and the characters were forgettable. If I read more Spenser novels they will have to be much earlier versions than this one.
3,Old Story,"Parker is such a good writer, it's a shame he is so hung up on the winey, self-centered Susan Silverman character. The story was a little too twisted this time. Not really enough focus on the plot. Not his best!"
4,How can a murder mystery seem so bright?,"The answer to the question is Parker's sense of wit and his positive outlook. Breezing through this book while trapped on a 9-hour trans-Atlantic flight from Hell, I was reminded of why Spenser has been so successful as a character -- he uses intelligence and principles to solve crimes and to live his life. There is no wallowing in self doubt after Spenser shoots a 2-bit hood who tries to kill him. Spenser is a true heroic man that anyone would love to have as a friend and hate to have as an enemy.Just another great read from Parker."
4,A standard Spenser novel -- and that ain't bad,"There are no big surprises in ""Widow's Walk"" and no great social questions to be explored. It is very much a standard Spenser novel, where the stalwart and flippant Boston PI takes on the bad guys. The case is simple: investigate the murder of a wealthy banker to help his much younger blonde wife beat the homicide charge. She can't be as dumb as she seems. Or maybe she really is. Spenser and Hawk and Susan are their usual selves. Not an earthshaking novel, but a good fast read that kept me turning the pages as more and more bodies piled up. Hey, ""Widow's Walk"" isn't going to win the Pulitzer Prize, but I'll be waiting happily for next year's Spenser novel..."
1,parker misses by a mile,"This latest novel in the suspense series tries to generate a more complex and intricate plot than some of the previous outings, which tend to be notable because Spenser and Hawk are so honorable and the ""bad guys"" so deserving of the punishment they receive. But here the killer remains in the shadows throughout, and the reader feels no genuine satisfaction at his eventual defeat. A real disappointment! What a relief that I checked it out of the library and didn't actually but it!"
4,A return to good form,"Mr Parker's Spenser has been taking a second seat next to the Jessie Stone novels lately, and you can tell. Hush Money was fine, but Hugger Mugger and Potshot were awful. I got this one a while ago, but never read it, and decieded it was time due to the new Spenser book, Back Story, coming out. I was pleasantly suprised.Not only was it finaly reset in Boston, but the novel had many twists and turns. Hawk and Vinnie Morris turn up, Susan and Spenser have to deal with an aging Pearl. The book is a turn towards the great books Mr Parker put out in the early 90s, like Walking Shadow, Chance, or Small Vices.Highly recomended."
3,Worse than Pot Shot,"If you thought Parker spent just a few minutes writing Pot Shot, wait until you read this doozy. Look...I continue to read the Spenser series--and gave this book three stars--because I love the characters, etc....but when Parker has such apparent disregard for his fans, and does such a poor job that even the characters are weak...well...guess it's time to concentrate on Robert Crais's Elvis Cole!"
1,at least work with a new outline,"The first ten Spenser books gave the reader a reason to care about the character, after that, I think Parker believed he could use the same outline and create a retirement plan for himself. Every office girl is cute, Hawk still is not in prison or dead, that banter is boring and Spenser is fat. The stories are the same, and not once, even in his other books (Jesse Stone) was there a plot twist or at least a variation in the pattern of how Parker ""builds"" the stories. Thank God I have gotten his last five books from the library. The money I saved, I bought John Sandford books instead."
4,Better than the Last,This book was much better than Death in Paradise. Although I wasn't really sure who the killer was. I did throughly enjoy the book. I felt that Susan kind of drag the storyline with her contining self-pity a little bit. But all and all it was very good.
4,Spencer - Always an Interesting Story,"While I found the book to be very entertaining, I did notice the writing was larger than normal. I hope it will stay this way so special eye-glasses are not necessary. Next book I would like to see much more of Hawk, Susan and Pearl.Robert B. Parker is my favorite author and I wish he would complete more than 1 Spencer Novel each year. Tall order!"
2,Braithwaite is Crazy -- WIDOW'S WALK is boring,"He may be a TOP 500 reviewer, but Kent Braithwaite's review of WIDOW'S WALK is way off the mark. This is one of the most BORING installments in the Spenser series, and this comment is coming from a die-hard Boston Red Sox and Robert Parker fan.There are several outright grammatical errors and typos in the book, which leads this non-TOP 500 reviewer to conclude that a) it was a first draft of the novel or b) his editor(s) are getting lazy.Save your $$$; wait for this to come out in paper."
2,Spenser Is Old And It Shows,"Larger than usual print, huge margins, a dying dog, a boring Susan; she's even worse than usual. Spenser must be in his 60's, closing in on 70, he did fight in Korea in the 50's after all. Parker writes as if Spenser's still around 40 and it just doesn't work. The young punks would run him and Hawk--another old man now--into the ground.Maybe Parker needs to set his next Spencers in the past, so we can see him again in his prime when Spenser was so incredibly original and exciting.This book is a huge disappointment to those of us who have followed this series from the very start.Sad."
2,Not Parker's Best,"Another reviewer started the review with ""I love Mr. Parker's books"". I agree, especially Spencer books, however, ""Widow's Walk"" does not measure up to earlier Spencers. The storyline is old, Susan is tiresome and I, for one, am tired of Robert B. Parker using Spencer and Susan to lecture us on how poorly homosexuals are treated by the rest of the world. Bob, we read your books because they are smart, clever, and captivating, not to hear your sermons. A second problem with ""Widow's Walk"" is that we don't even see the bad guy's name until the end of the book. How can we begin to solve the crime with you if the charaters aren't introduced?I am glad to see Spencer back. When the next one comes out, I'll rush out and get it and read in an evening again, but when I am bored some evening and go for a reread, it won't be ""Widow's Walk"". Please Bob, its time for another ""Catskill Eagle"" or ""Judas Goat"". I can't recommend ""Widow's Walk""."
1,Punchy,"Just as he must have staggered to his feet when Ezzard Charles was beating the crap out of him way back in '49, Spenser lumbers back into the ring for a few more rounds after a couple of out-of-state beatings (i.e., ""Hugger Mugger"", ""Potshot""). He's back on his home turf, looking fat and sassy before a hometown crowd. The whole entourage is in his corner, pulling for a knockout. At first, he looks pretty good, dancing about, landing a flurry of jabs, but then his legs go dead, the clinches are more frequent, and soon he's sleepwalking. Yeah, there's some blood. The crowd always loves that. At the end, his punches go loopy; he's huffing and puffing, covering his face. Then you realize that it's all an illusion: once again old man Spenser's only shadow boxing. These ancient fighters, they gotta know when to hang up the gloves."
1,teribble cd,"this cd is so horrible,i would never pay money for it. i heard some songs at some little kids house and it was so pathetic. he should stick to basketball, cause at least there he has skill, and people actually admire him(playing basketball). he should stop rapping, it's gonna ruin his carreer, not that he really has one though. dont buy this cd it's very pathetic."
3,It's got a good beat,"While Shoot Pass Slam is by far the best track on the album it's missing the toughness that Are you a roughneck brings...which is claimed to be an idea based on Jeff Foxworthys work. Shaqs Diesel isn't without it's biographical entries Let me in, Let me in he sings of his childhood when his brothers and sisters locked him out of his bedroom and all he had was an empty paint can to entertain himself. Overall it's deserving of three stars it was a great effort for a man who balances the NBA and his music career but not the best album produced by an NBA athlete. For that honor belongs to Scottie Pippen with his under appreciated baladeering album Let's make tonight last forever his falsetto is said to be able to crack fine china. Anyway Shaq I greatly look forward to hearing your future recordings"
3,Yo Shaq where you at?,to me this album is funny..but hey you gotta laugh once in a great while..play it at a party you'll get the crowd jumping or looking at you funny! Be different dont put in Ja-Rule... Its all in good fun.play trax 1 ...
5,KICKS BUTT,This cd is really good. Shaq is better then any of those other hardcore rappers out there. Some people don't like him because he's not a gangster but he rocks!
3,You might like it - you might hate it,"You might like it, you might hate it, but one thing is for sure, its got a great bass hit on Skillz ! Sounds way good on a nice 15 or 18 sub."
1,worse than his free throws,this is so stupid it's funny. it's so bad not even his family would buy it. but if you think this is bad you should watch his movie Kazaam. at least in Shaq Diesel you don't have to watch him act stupid.
1,"This isn't Rap, it's Comedy.","Normally I am pretty forgiving for horrible recordings. This time I'm not. No matter how you look at it, Shaq can not rap. Most of the time I don't know what the hell he is talking about. People that don't know anything about rap or who have never listened to rap before might think that he has ""got skillz"", but anyone who knows better will probably feel the same way I do. Frankly, his free-throws are better then his rap."
3,Why not?,"Not the best rap album ever. But I find Shaquille entertain in many ways in this album. It's nice to have, I bought it because of Outstanding & Skillz."
3,A war on Drugs,This book is a story about what a true war on drugs would be like. The characters are a realistic bunch of people. This is a good rainy day book.
5,The Great Communicator in Action,"An amazing collection of Reagan's letters, from childhood to retirement, on subjects both grand and minor. I was surprised by the magnitude of his correspondence; his ability to succinctly explain his position on a variety of issues was exceptional.So many people dismissed Reagan as an uneducated cowboy. This collection of Ronald Reagan's personal correspondence demonstrates his unsurpassed abilities of self-expression and candor, as well as his heartfelt love of America and the freedoms for which she stands.An excellent read for anyone, regardless of where they fall in the political spectrum."
4,Good Book,This gives you a different side of Ronald Reagan that you normally didn't see because of politics and media coverage. I was some what suprised. I would recommend this book.I question if the person from Chicago read this book. Sounds like he/she doesn't like Ol'Ronnie. Ya think!!!
1,Disappointing,I was really disappointed with this book. I was expecting something greater. We needed to hear more about the great accomplishments of the man who saved the world. I wish that we could really honor this man the way he would have liked it.
1,More myth making,"This book continues the attempt in neo-conservative circles to make Reagan look like a respectable president. Reagan did tremendous damage to the United States with his tax cuts, his illegal actions in the Iran-Contra scandal, etc. Books like this try to rewrite history by creating the myth of Reagan the hero."
5,Inspiration for the rest of us,"After all the sneering put downs from the leftist elitists, we can see the truth of a great man, in his own words. Almost singlehanded, he led the revolt of the common man against the elitists who would steal the common man's liberty for crass political gain. The revolution continues."
5,Wonderful Read,"This is a book I would read again. It was as if I got to eavesdrop on RR conversatons with family, friends and confidants it was privilaged reading from a master wordsmith."
4,Almost Perfect,"The letters are great. Shows what kind of person Reagan was from the very beginning, how he thought and how he progressed in life. Too bad his editors (with all their pedigrees) didn't take the time to check out the facts. Pg 161...Gene Autry did NOT own the Los Angeles Dodgers, He owned the Los Angeles Angels. (now the California Angels)"
4,The Greatest German Opera Since Lulu,"It's a shame to have to give this video 4 stars, for the opera truly rates at 5 plus. Zimmermann's monumental score is rather poorly performed here by the orchestra; the poor audio quality detracts even further, with much detail lost. The staging can really only be appreciated live, with action occurring on 5 stages, often with simultaneous events in two or more different places. The camera direction is hardly adequate, although the only way to begin to replicate this would be with some sort of split-screen effect.Even considering all these faults, the viewer will be able to get a feel and true appreciation for the genius of Zimmermann, making the video well worth viewing. Two caveats are in order, however: (1) The video does not ""star"" B. A. Zimmermann. He is the composer, and has been dead since 1970, and; (2) The captions are not in ""unknown,"" but rather in an adequately-rendered English."
2,not what I was hoping for,I had sampled this at a store once and absolutely loved it. But the bottle I have smells acidic and chemically and the sent hardly last. Wish I had returned it. :(Too bad I normally love their stuff. The seller was prompt and cool and all that.
5,Great Toy for preschoolers,"My 3 year old daughter loves this game. The barking dog house is too cute. It does have some educational value with learning colors, green, red, yellow, & blue and also counting to 3. It has some good memory skill building as well b/c you need to remember where your color bones are if another player finds them. This is just a good fun family game. It is also a pretty quick game so it keeps the attention of younger children. I think the age range of 7 and up is a bit high. I would recommend it for preschoolers!!!!!!"
5,An Amazing Accessory,"I like the photos as well as the short explanations on the history of the scarf .One picture is worth 1,000 words !"
2,bad merchandise,It was said to be new but when it cane it had a sticker on the movie saying please rewind! when i put the tape in there was static very loud! Very disappointed can i get a new one or replacement?
4,Brad can lick my spoon of peanut butter any time!,"I really enjoyed this movie. I thought that the ending was a bit different. I like the fact that he came back, but all that did was stir up to many questions for me. Brad can lick my peanut butter spoon anytime."
1,Took too long and didn't work!,"This shipment took many weeks to receive. when I did get it, it wouldn't play. I found out it was for a different region......not able to play here in US or Canada. They didn't make it obvious in the product that it was that way........you would have had to scroll all the way down to see it wouldn't work. Why didn't they mention that it wouldn't play in the US next to the title where it would be easily seen and realized? Now they want me to ship it back to get a refund......which will probably take another month, if I get one back at all. I will NEVER order fro them again."
2,This offends all sensibilities,I actually felt like I was coming down with the flu when I finished seeing this movie. The music swelled to unbearable levels and was painfully long though there were plenty of moments when I was sure it would come to a halt and put me out of my misery. I left unsure of whether I wanted to see another film for awhile.
4,"Good, serviceable history","This is a useful book if you are looking for a standard and readable history of the book. It seemed to me authoritative, but its citations are a bit skimpy. Sometimes the author tells us where she's getting her information, and at other times she doesn't. The bibliography is OK.Howard doesn't advance an argument or any new thesis about the history of the book. Rather, this is a convention history of a technology, based on progress and development. I wish she had had more to say about what newer technological changes actually pose to the relevance of the book itself. She just assumes that the book will always be important, but I think this is a presumption that one can't so easily sustain."
4,Coco Montoya shines,"The best reason to buy this cd is to hear the guitar playing of Coco Montoya, Mayall's fabulous lead guitarist. Check out the soloing in songs like Maydell. Montoya is as smooth and fast as Eric Clapton playing the blues. A great addition to any blues collection."
5,UMTS Networks,It's a great book. The chapters explain and develop the UTRAN and CN concepts defined in the 3GPP specifications. Could be great if the chapter dedicated to UMTS Services its more detailed.
1,Flawed,"I agree with J. from Richmond that only saying the Russian dialog once per lesson makes it tough to learn the correct pronunciation of the Russian words. While having each Russian expression repeated might have added somewhat to the length of the recording time it would have been well worth it to the user. And, in exchange, they certainly could have saved some recording time by largely eiminating lession 1, which spends an inordinate amount of time explaining why one should learn a foriegn language, how great this product is, yada, yada, yada.Also, even with my limited knowledge of Russian I can tell they are not accurately translating from English into Russian. For example, the English ""I want a map"" is translated into the Russian ""I want to buy a map"". Depending upon the situation that inaccuracy would mean the unaware user was saying something completely different from what he/she intended!"
3,for ten bucks you can't go wrong,"Just interested in getting a sense of the Russian language and tonal quality, many expensive CD's and books are on the market, for ten dollars on this product how can you miss, enough to get going, as advertised; however it is what it is, this is not the definitive sudy guide to living in Russia, well worth the price!"
5,Impossible to find!!!,"I love these makeup pads! Some people think they are too oily, but they get your eyeliner (the industrial strength stuff, like Urban Decay) off with two swipes and the mascara comes off too. I hate the non oily pads because you have to wipe so hard you irritate the delicate eye area. Love these. The price was unbeatable."
1,Won't be using these again!,"Yikes! These are super greasy pads, and they left my vision blurred, despite my best efforts to wash it off with facial cleanser. Yuck."
1,Interesting!,"It's very interesting that my review wasn't on this link.I just re-purchased this product and as I stated......It SHOULD come with a seal.....mine did not.Also, mine was a quarter full, while the new one I purchased was full to about a 1/4 inch from the top."
1,Slick eye pads,Did not like this product at all. The eye pads are extremely greasy and not that pleasant to the eye area. I was looking for a good way to remove eye make-up-this is definetely not the way TOO OILY
5,Don't shoot the messenger!,"Read the program description BEFORE you purchase this product to avoid being disappointed with the content. OK, there is no singing on this program. But what you do have here are the best trumpet and trombone players before the public today. The performances are exceptional, and the program works well - it's enjoyable and tastefully done. It definitely deserves high marks. If you think you would be interested in a program of operatic transcriptions for brass, then this program is a joy."
1,No Singing Here,"Beware ... there is no singing on this disk. It consists of three musicians -- Hakan Hardenberger, who modestly describes himself as the world's greatest trumpeter, and two young friends, a trombonist and a pianist, who play a number of transcribed opera and ballet tunes. Nice playing, but perhaps not what one would expect."
1,Not Phillips' usual quality--skip if you can,"I was very disappointed with this book. I wouldn't have read more than the first few pages, except I had to write a book report on it. Very BORING overview of each book of the Bible. I actually got more from reading the intro to each book in my Ryrie Study Bible. If you are looking for a good Survey of the Bible book, I would recommend ""What the Bible is All About"" by Henrietta Mears. You can get it in a KJV version.What the Bible Is All About Handbook-Revised-KJV Edition: Bible Handbooks - An Inspired Commentary on the Entire Bible"
5,FINALLY!,"It's nice that they FINALLY release this DVD. The down side being it states that it has been digitally enhanced, but my VHS tapes have a better picture quality. Still, it's Kolchak on DVD."
4,Kolchak - The Night Stalker DVD,"This is a great for nostalgic fans of the original television show, and not the reproduction that went off the air last year. The plots are somewhat campy, but that is what makes this a classic."
4,Still SCARY!,"2 of the discs were scratched and hard to watch. They were shipped that way when I recieved them. I Watched this when I was young and it still is a little scary, and weird! But I love it!"
4,Back To My Youth!,Receiving the Night Stalker brought me back to the good years but also highlighted the great scripwriting we had then. The quality was good and a sheer-joy to watch
5,It's Well Worth The Money !!,"As one reviewer wrote, it is seemingly hard to find this set on the retail market. I can't understand why but would also like to know the reason. I ordered my copy from Amazon. There has been some expressed disappointment with quality of the disks but I find them to be quite clear and easy on the eyes. I have seen the VHS copies that are out and this DVD compilation is better.And, for the price, you get the entire twenty episodes of this great 70's t.v. show. All that were ever made. It's a steal deal, in my opinion."
3,Why has Best Buy pulled this set. I can't find it anywhere and,"today I was told by a salesperson at Best Buy that they no longer carried it. He confirmed this by checking their computer records. He said they were carrying it, but doesn't know why they stopped. I've also been to other retailers like Target and Walmart and they don't have it either. Anyone know why? I hear the quality of this set is an issue. I'm really disappointed since I've been waiting awhile to get this series which was a childhood favorite of mine. Seems Amazon is still carrying it though."
2,BEWARE of Kolchak DVD!,"I won't bore readers with my assessment of the Kolchak TV series - you're reading this because you're already a fan. That said, yes, it's great that Kolchak has finally been released on DVD. HOWEVER,Universal has taken drastic steps to market the series as the `inspiration' for X-Files. Namely, they've jacked up the contrast and DRAMATICALLY darkened each episode, to the point where the premiere episode (The Ripper) is actually hard to watch (people wearing dark suits sitting on dark desks blend into one, and so forth). This DOES have a few advantages - it certainly `ups' the `spook' value of the show and conceals artifacts of some of the more shoddy monster suits used in the series. But all in all, the quality of this release is no better than the excellent Columbia House video transfers of a decade ago. Image detail is adequate, and contrary to marketng hype Universal has done absolutely NO restoration work. Shame on the studio! Purchase Kolchak with caution!"
4,Manufacturing Defect Detracts from Delightful DVDs,"Classic television Americana. Having grown up in Chicago, it was fun to see the wide-angle shots of the city the way it looked when I was just a few years old.Nostalgia aside, the show had good direction, acting, photography (for TV), and a good dose of fun.Unfortunately, the manufacturing process used to create the DVD's of this great show was sub-par. On several occasions, the DVD would simply stop. At first, I thought it was my DVD player. I tried the faulty disc in my computer and the same thing happened.It's really too bad because this would otherwise be a must-have.Maybe you'll have better luck."
1,Great Series but....,"You can forget one side of the 3rd disc, it just will not play. I now have two sets and am getting ready to send those back to Amazon. Do not buy unless you can live with this?"
3,Night Stalker,"Because of the way the product was presented, I assumed I was purchasing the original television movie rather than the series. That said, Darren McGavin is perfect in the role of Kolchak and some of the episodes are quite good. None, however, measure up to the original, set in Las Vegas and having the viewer share Kolchak's skepticism about what supernatural happenings. Would still like to find the original tv movie."
4,Love that theme music!,"Unless you were one of us who watched ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" during it's original run 30 years ago (and have a nostalgic affection for it), you will probably find this show quaint and tame compared to the horror fare today. The show followed a rigid formula with certain plot elements you could count on every episode: bumbling reporter Carl Kolchak will run afoul of authorities, he will meet a number of eccentrics who help him gather clues, and he will somehow manage to come face-to-face with the terrifying menace at the end. Not every episode was great (The Werewolf, The Spanish Moss Murders, Horror in the Heights, and The Sentry are my favorites), but snappy writing and the great Darren McGavin as Kolchak make these worth checking out. Try to see past the the 70's styles and cheesy production values, and just enjoy it for the fun ""monster of the week"" show it was intended to be. Love that theme music!"
3,One of the better ones of the series.,"One of the more intelligent ones of the series. Its too bad this series only lasted one year; with some TLC it could have been a real success. As it is, even though many of the plot devices were somewhat silly the show was good because of the performance of Darren McGavin. He is at once charming, outrageous, funny and fun. There were cute ongoing plot contrivances as well such as the Lovelorn Columnist written by the old lady [they even did a show around her being the only one Kolchak trusts] and the frustrated editor."
4,The Original Night Stalker TV Series,"Although the pacing isn't as fast as what you'd see today and the incidental music isn't to my taste, this is a great series. I don't mind the cheesy special effects. McGavin did a terrific job with his portrayal of Carl Kolchak, INS reporter. Most of the episodes hold up well 30+ years later.I didn't have any problems with the set. Picture was clear on my HDTV and even on a ""portable"" set. Sound is good and close captioning is available.Watching this series at my home reminds me of watching at my grandmother's house with my mom and dad when I was a kid. If this set won't bring back memories, it may give you nightmares. Enjoy!You may also want to pick up the paperback ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker Chronicles."" There are some good short stories in there!"
5,They don't make them like this anymore!,"When I am in a quandry about what to watch, I'm always happy to put on one of these episodes. Just all in all good fun and well produced. I wish that tv producers now would watch some of these shows and take a hint...you don't need tons of special effects, prosthetics, and all that to make an interesting, gripping show, you just need writers with some imagination and a cast and crew who really take their craft seriously. This show is better than so many of the sci-fi shows/movies I've watched recently. And it's almost 40 years old. I go back to these episodes again and again. I also purchased the Ellery Queen Season 1, and again, head and shoulders above most of the junk out there...but I'll review that on it's own merits."
5,Kolchak,"It is exactly what I wanted! Darren McGavin was such a kooky guy! He and his boss Simon Oakland were terrific together. Now that I'm older by 30+ years, I can really appreciate the dynamics & the comedy. Very happy with my purchase!"
3,Kolchak-The Night Stalker,"I bought these dvd's because I remembered this probram when it was new. My brother and I would sit and watch with our eyes half covered, peeking out from behind the covers. Honestly, it was better then. Maybe I grew up, but it wasn't as frightening now, and many of the funny stuff I remember was removed. In the original shows, it seems Kolchak would tear a page out of the phone book in almost every episode, while tracking down leads. These have been taken out of all but one episode. This makes me wonder what else has been removed."
3,Kolchak tv series film missing from DVD release,"Hi Kolchak fans!Well Universal finally released the cult classic on DVD.Missing film: The first four episodes (before title graphics)were called- the night stalker. ABC thought TV Guide readers wouldthink it was the original tv movie, so the changed the name tokolchak: the night stalker starting with episode five. I have myold VHS tapes from I taped from CBS Late Movie in 1987 to verify this along with the behind the scenes book Night Stalker Companion. The original Universal Logo is cut from the end from each episode. Watch this space as the story develops. carl."
2,The Night Stinker,"FACT - this series stinks the big one. ITEM - this series was so bad even the guy who played him wanted out. After a promising start, a parade of UFO's, rubber lizards and werewolves turned it into Irwin Allen on a bad day. Which was, lets face it, most days. Often shambolic in execution, McGavin mugs it up shamelessly to paper the cracks.I give it a star for some witty lines and the dog episode which I rather liked."
5,"Loved the series, very happy with purchase.","I grew up watching this series and loved Darren McGavin's offbeat Kolchak character. The story lines and production values are a bit cheeky, but this is part of the overall appeal. Have to agree with other reviewers regarding the transfer; there are some fairly dark scenes in this series and they didn't always transfer well, especially on my home TV (59"" plasma). Otherwise, I would highly recommend this series. I stream the series using my original Kindle Fire, the new Fire HD 8.9"" with no issues."
3,Fun,"I enjoyed these when the aired and they are nice for a cold, winter's night. McGavin plays the part perfectly. The plots are not much but they're fun. And clean."
5,A Walk Back In Time,"To write this review I have to admit my age but for a short lived show, this was great. Action, mystery, horror, it was a kids dream come true. It's wonderful that someone has opted to forever preserve this in DVD format. If you prefer the past over the future, you'll love this. It's a show the entire family can watch without fear of scenes nowdays that could only be seen previously in a movie theater."
4,Great to have this on DVD,I loved this show as a kid. It's great to have it on DVD. There are no extras with this DVD set and Universal did little to clean up the picture and sound. I too have a beef with the double sided DVD's in this box set. But I am still glad to have them on DVD and watch them when I want.
5,I can write a good review when I like something,"Just for the record, this is about the only TV show on DVD that is actually worth owning. Okay so they made only so many episodes, and were only on one season. But this show was rather unqiue in that it was about the paranormal, but it did not take itself too seriously. The make-up and costumes might seem a bit fake, but hey this is 1970's television, a little bit of cheese can often go a long way and with Darren Mcgavin and Simon Oakland play off each other as well as they do, you can watch this show and not take it too seriously. Forget about Scully and Muldar."
3,Not as Expected,I love Burt's Bees and decided to purchase this to try products I hadn't used. Did not recieve any of the pictured items. Instead the package had 4 different types of hand cream. Very dissapointed.
5,My favorite tea of all time!,"I love this tea. I first tried it at Meadowood in NapaValley under a different name. Now it is Orange Dulce and I am a fan. I love tea and have to say it's rare to black tea this good. The orange is extremely subtle, one should not expect any real orange flavor. You really just get a hint of citrus and other flavors in a strong rich black tea."
5,Mighty Leaf Orange Dulce,The tea is delicious and the shipping was very quick. The box was torn when I received it and I was a bit concerned but the number of tea bags was accurate.
3,Flavor not for me.,"The quality of the tea is good, but I didn't care for the flavor. I'm more of a cinnamon girl. I ended up giving it to my sister."
1,Pass!,"OK, so I do not read historical romance novels for their historical accuracy, but at least I expect the writer (or the editor) to make an effort. This book was so full of mistakes, either in dates or forms of address, that I couldn't seem to warm up to the love story. Never mind that the heroine's name is actually a male's (Alexandre), or that she is the most selfish character I have encountered in a while. The ""romance"" takes place during the French Revolution, Alix flees from her chateau to Paris after the murder of her father, she is rescued from near rape by Rafe (an English Earl turned merchant). What follows are 300 pages of innane dialogue, unbeliavable situations, ohhh... did I forget to mention that Alix is pursued by a villain? Bad, bad, bad. Save your money on this one."
5,Excellent story teller.,"I really enjoyed this novel, and the sequel Souvenir of Love, I hope Ms Novins continues with the story line to include other characters introduced in book 2, Only disapointment for me was that she has only written the two books. I find her novels to have very interesting plots, with just the right amount of love interest,cannot put them down once I start them."
2,Aburrida,"No hay dudas de que el autor sabe escribir, pero al parecer no tiene qué contar. A la novela le faltan sustancia, trama, situaciones fuertes, personajes que la hagan creíble y que generen expectativa."
1,Una máquina de fabricar bostezos,"Si estás buscando un libro de más de 200 páginas en el que no pase casi nada, ya lo encontraste, es este. El plot podría resumirse en una página y media (contándolo con lujo de detalles) y el resto es pura divagación y tristeza por la decadencia de La Habana."
1,Total Garbage,"I paid almost $300 for the toilet because it has a 4"" flush hole instead of 3"". Little did I know that the flush handle was made of plastic instead of metal. This plastic flush handle might last 2 months if you're lucky. It will be cheaper and way less of a hassle for me in the long run to just buy another brand of new toilet that has a metal handle."
2,Boring bed set!,"I was not impressed with this bedding. The comforter looked as though it was hand sewn by an amatuer. It has wide, loose white threading and is made of thin material. The dust ruffle was straight, boxed and boring. I had to add on to make this bedding have a little more oomph to it."
5,More Than A Book For Young Adults,"I am amazed that at almost 70 years of age, Eleanor Garner could so coherently and deftly capture the details and feelings of her life from age 8 to age 16. The author manages to retain the innocence and freshness of young Eleanor's experiences without contaminating them with the rationalizations and/or excuses that we as adults conveniently use to explain the actions of ourselves, our family and our friends -- especially in retrospect.In addition to being a good storyteller, Eleanor captures the essence of being a stranger in a strange land -- especially a young stranger. With equal clarity, she graphically demonstrates the up-tight, strict, and conservative attitudes of parents and educators in the decade of the '40s.Although Amazon has chosen to place this in the ""Young Adult"" category, I found that it was just as relevant for me; an adult who remembers what it was like growing up in the 40's."
5,A child's view,"""Eleanor's Story: An American Girl in Hitler's Germany"" I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It gave a perspective of children's lives who live in a war torn state. It helped me with compassion for victims of war within a country. It takes us through all the emotions of a young girl - whether living in war or not. It shows how just living a normal life can be heroic in its own right. Excellent reading for young adult or adult. Great book for high school reading. Read it!"
5,An Exceptional Life and a Wonderful Book,"This is one of the best memoirs I have read about Nazi Germany. Difficult issues are handled with dignity and clarity. Further, as an American girl, the author has a unique perspective on the events unfolding around her. I could not put this book down."
2,Good!!,We are such fans of these shows I have the DVD's of all their seasons and also on my ipad. Can't get enough of these shows!!
5,I Loved This Book!,"I had to read this book for school this year and I was one of the only people in the class that really enjoyed it. It is hard to understand the different stories, but if you just take out a piece of paper and chart what is happening with each person, you can really enjoy the book without becoming confused. DON'T BUY THE CLIFFS NOTES becuase you really won't get the experience that you would with the real book! Just take some effort and read the book, and take time to chart the stories and I guarantee that you will LOVE it as well!"
4,There's a bonus DVD version of this !,"I was amazed to find out that the DVD was an actual ""New Day Yesterday"" concert, not just a music video. What an incredible talent. The raw Stevie Ray voice mixed with ""Joe's Blues style."" I say ""Joe's Blues Style"" because he likes to showcase his speed which I don't agree with in blues. You can hear some Joe Satriani, Jeff Beck, KWS, and Hendrix.This guy could be what blues has been missing since SRV's passing."
3,IN the elite,These guy is awesome. If you can ever see him live pick up those tickets fast. I have seen him once already and have tickets to see him again in the fall.He is in my opinion today's greatest blues guitarist. He mixes just the perfect amount of blues with rock. he also has a very unique voice.
4,"Look out for this ""Joe"" - This album has it all","This is a great Blues/Rock CD by Joe Bonamassa. If you haven't heard of him and you like blues rock ala SRV, Clapton, etc...Just go get it. Mind you Joe has his own style and isn't a wannabe copycat by any means.This record has something for everybody. Great song writing. Good straight ahead rock tunes viable for radio. A few killer guitar tunes that will have your jaw on the floor (Pain and Sorrow & Takin' the Hit). Some mellow bluesy numbers that I'm sure would impress some of the best. On top of that Joe matches his great guitar work with equally impressive vocals. With some support and backing from his record label this record could explode big for Joe. If you like this also take a listen to Eric Gales, Doyle Bramhall II & Graig Erickson. A few other extremely talented musicians in that same blues/rock category."
2,whos is that and what did he do with Joe?,"I was so disappointed with this album.What makes it so disappointing is that I have 6 JB albums now and all the others a so good.This one seems like an attempt to get airplay on mainstream radio and sounds very commercial, cynics would say sell out.For me there are a couple of listenable tracks - pain and sorry is very good in fact, but the rest is full of hook-linesIf you like great blues, try Joes other albums Blues Deluxe,Slo Gin, Ballad of John Henry and Black Rock, I have these and would rate them all 5 stars"
2,Disappointing,"After listening to Bonamassa on ""New Day Yesterday"" I was captured by the raw power and abundance of guitar mastery.So - I went and bought the lot of Bonammassas CDs hoping to dig into more imaginative guitar power.In ""So, It's Like That"" I found an abundance of sing-along la-la cliches. If you are a fan of Bruce Springsteen you will like the hoarse screaming and loose guitar chords. Allright, a few places the guitar shines but the melodi lines and the broad chrorus style singing drags it down into the pit of trivialities. Sorry!A single track, ""Pain and Sorrow"" shines though but boy it was hard to get to track 9. Track 13, ""The Hard Way"", has a 4 minutes sing-along intro ... or whatever happened as a new track actually starts after 4 minutes and 17 SECONDS OF SILENCE lastning the remaining almost 4 minutes. Maybe it's art, what do I know!"
1,This is not Blues,"I was expecting something similar to SRV, KWS or Wes Jeans.....not at all. This is not blues. Hard rock and soft rock. There is 1 blues song on the CD and 3 on the DVD. Good guitar player with extreme potential in blues but this one is certainly not a blues album."
2,missing something,"Based on my affitnity for the blues/rck genre and the 5 star rating of Joe's playing I picked up the CD/DVD combo(Amazon) and was, I hate to admit it, dissappointed. Granted, he can play and has good chops, but for me, something was missing. Maybe that intangible. The fire that comes through the amps. Not that his playing was not emotional or inspired form his point of view, but for me it was lacking. I need to watch it again to see if I feel the same way. Like the a previous two star reviewer, I would have enjoyed seeing this guy in a local bar or someone's basement and would walked away satisfied. But when you start playing with the big boys, this guy comes up short."
4,Early but good,Some quality tunes and scratchy voice singing on this album. Guitar playing is rugged but skillful. Lyrics seem personal in nature.
5,He has arrived!,"Every so often an exceptional guitarist comes along. There was Hendrix in the 60's, Stevie Ray in the 80's and now there's Bonamassa in the 20 hundreds!"
5,DIFFERENT BUT JUST AS GOOD AS NEW DAY YESTERDAY,"I ordered this CD after having the good fortune of having picked up NEW DAY YESTERDAY on someones recommendation. It blew me away and is one of my favourites at the moment. This new one is totally different. Less Blues, more power POP and ROCK and every song is an original. I reviewed this after only a few listens and got it totally wrong. Every song on this CD is first class and a few of them almost classics. It took me about a dozen listens before I fell in love with this CD, but now it gets continuous play. There is no one out there at the moment who can play guitar at this level, write great songs and have a great voice as well. Joe Bonamassa delivers on all counts. Simply a must CD for any music fan.PAIN AND SORROW alone is worth the price, rarely does a song of such power come along."
5,A wonderful introduction to asian religion,"This book was a lovely, focused introduction to Hinduism and Buddhism, with a little Jainism and Taoism thrown in for good measure. I loved Cambpell's ability both to find the lovely, telling details in each of these traditions, and to find the overarching themes--especially the idea of Brahman, which he sees as underpinning all of them. I also particularly loved Cambpell's sense of humor--in one section he's describing the reincarnation of the soul, and says it's putting on and taking off bodies ""like a shopper at Macy's trying on scarves""! That page is marked in my copy by the tea I sputtered because I laughed so loudly.The only downside from my point of view was an emphasis in the sections on Buddhism on Mahayana as opposed to Theravada Buddhism. Though he does discuss the older branch of the Buddhist tradition, it is somewhat in passing. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this book enormously."
5,12-Play,I really enjoyed listening to the CD. It was of good quality. I have no issues with the songs at all.
5,I love R Kelly!,"He's the man :) this is crazy I love him and his music this CD is really nice, very smooth."
5,"Medieval setting,plot twists,romance.What more do you need?","The writing is so spectacular, my emotions reactedas if I were remembering a part of my own liferather than just reading words in a book.Mary Brown is clearly a sensitive individual, andthis is reflected in her writing.The tale of Jack and Sprat will leave youyearning for more."
5,A Rare Find,"I discovered this book - like many others out there - years ago at my local library, after I had read Mary Browns fabulous PIGS DON'T FLY series. I immediately fell in love. To this day, it remains my favorite novel. Even though I teach composition to college students and have to slog through a plethora of books on a monthly basis, PLAYING THE JACK maintains its numero uno slot on my book list. Find and buy this book. You will not regret it. I posted a picture of the cover on amazon, so if by chance you come across it at a dime bookstore or in your library, you won't miss the chance to catch it."
5,"An exciting journey into the past that is ""unputdownable""","I loved this book! I don't want to give away any of the plot because that's one of the things that makes this book so special. Basically, it's set in the 1700s and has four parts beginning with a young runaway boy who is befriended by a travelling group of fair performers.The characters are so real you can almost touch them. The script has you riveted and is sometimes downright hilarious.It's a timeless story and if you're lucky enough to have a copy you will read it over and over again and never become bored with it."
3,"Not a Bad Read, Just Not my Thing.","This book is very similar to ""Your Body Speaks its Mind"" by the same author. In this book the author makes his case about basic human instincts and how are wounded psyches can impede these very basic needs. The author gives many first hand experiences with his patients to make his case.This book is a quick read, I read the bulk of it in one day and finished it the next. I'm not really a fan of this author as I didn't really get much out of this book nor the other one I mentioned. I have a hard time relating to his material but I'm sure his books have helped a lot of people."
1,Un franais trop difficile,Le franais de la Renaissance est trop difficile pour me permettre d'apprécier ce vieux texte dont les effets comiques sont aussi bien vieux.
1,The Horror! THE HORROR!!!!!!!!!!,"In nine short words: This is the worst book I have ever read. It is awful, simply awful! First of all, it's 800+ pages long, so it takes ages to read. The jokes that are supposed to be rude are outdated and disgusting. The only upside of this is that that's where the word 'Gargantuan' came from, and I don't think we could live without that word."
5,Incredible Reading,"In all my years of reading, this is one of the few books that was very difficult to put down.It was a very moving book. I felt so close to Chenia that she became part of me. I felt her happiness and her sadness. I was there with her at the Cloisters,walking on Dyckman, taking the elevator down to the subway. I was totally submerged into her world.I wish I was able to read the book before my Mom past away last yeasr. It would have provided a better insight to her upbringing and the traditional thoughts and feelings of her generation.It was a beautifully written story. I hung on to every word and was sorry it had to end. This is a book worth reading and I hope to see more books from this wonderful author."
4,"Good, but not Great","Carole Glickfeld begins her novel, Swimming Toward the Ocean, with a minor miracle: Devorah, the first-person narrator, narrates the opening scenes from within her mother's womb. The story builds compellingly as the characters develop, but it sags a bit after the midpoint, and the plot is weakened by its reliance on devices, such as a financial windfall that takes us out of realism and into fantasy. Swimming Toward the Ocean is not a long novel, but this reader believes it could have been edited down a bit, as the main characters eventually become predictable and tiresome. But Glickfeld is a gifted and disciplined writer, on the whole, and her debut novel is much better than most that are being published today."
5,"The Promise, Hard to put down","The PromiseThis book had been recommended to me by a lady in my church group, she love it so much. I bought it ""used"" and upon looking at it I realized it was preceeded by the book by the same autor(The Chosen) so I bought The Chosen and started reading it. It is very detailed and some times I got lost in all the detail, but after I finished The Chosen I began The Promise, and really began to get into the life of RUTHEN and his father and friend DANNY. I very much liked both books and will recommend them to my family and friends, I will LOAN them my copies if they will promis to return them. Thanks, Charlotte Theile, Cincinnati, OH"
5,The best book I've ever read! (read the Chosen first),"Chaim Potok is a genius! In this sequal to his book the Chosen, he explores the Danny&Reuven relationship on a truly amazing level. The book tackles issues of love, understanding, hate, compassion, and empathy. I could not put this book down. Truly the best book I've ever read! I think I got from it even more than Mr. Potok intended his readers to come away with. I suggest reading the Chosen first, because it will help the reader appreciate and understand the subtle nuances and corralations that enter into the story."
4,"Not as good as the first, but still wonderful","This book is a wonderful sequel to <i>The Chosen</i>. While it addresses different issues in a different time, the book is still deeply moving. I did not find the plot as interesting as the first, though I still very much loved this novel. I finished it the day it arrived in the mail. Like <i>The Chosen</i>, Potok uses many Yiddish, Hebrew and Aramaic words in his writing, but explains them so that even non-Jews can understand and enjoy the plot. If you loved the first book, this book is a necessary read!"
4,Love it,"I bought this as an alternative to the Pink Delicious scent. It is quite a different scent, but is pleasant."
4,"Powerful, Emotional, and Melodious Alternative Rock","This three piece band from York, PA pack a big punch in their EP We Can Make It. They are a talented group of guys, as is shown in their hard rocking, yet intelligent music. Throughout the EP they show a different blend of rock styles, showing their versatility and giving a vibe that leaves you wanting to hear more. Starting with the title track, Kavanah shows the more poppy side to their music. Moving to the next two songs there is a gradual shift to an edgier rock, with a pouring out of emotion in Father, the 3rd track. King of me continues in a blend of the three previous songs with power, pop, and edge. The last song is what gets me the most. Just thinking is the title and it is an acoustic based song of intensity and emotion. All together, the album is totally incredible, and I would recommend it to all music lovers out there. It is worth the listen."
2,"Good sound, when they stay on my ears.","I had such high hopes for these headphones. I wanted to hook them over my ears and go running whenever I pleased. But it was not to be.The day after I received my headphones, my grandmother passed away. I packed my bags, put my idpod and headphones in my carry-on, and headed to the airport. Once settled in my seat, I tried to put on my headphones, but they kept falling off my ears. I tried to adjust them, bending the earclips all sorts of ways, but it was extremely difficult to do so, and my adjustments wouldn't hold.If I couldn't get these headphones to stay on when I was stationary, running was out of the question.Maybe others have had better luck. Maybe my ears are just too small for them. But I am not impressed with these headphones."
3,NOT A GOOD VALUE,"I'VE BOUGHT OVER THE EAR HEADPHONES FOR $7. THAT WERE BETTER. THE SOUND IS OK, BUT THEY DON'T FIT WELL AND YOU CAN'T ADJUST THEM."
3,At least they work ...,"If you are like me then you have a devil of a time using ear-bud or indwelling headphones of ANY sort. I got these because the Skullcandy headphones I bought, though boasting SUPERB sound quality and being comfortable, would fall out every third step while I was running. These headphones stay in for the most part thanks to that plastic piece that fits behind your ear but the headphone itself is a little oddly shaped and does not sit well in my ear. Furthermore, though I am no audiophile, I do like to have decent sound quality and these are a bit metallic in the treble and use very little base. This is not a bad product for the price and though I am sure you can do better, I still have not found a good pair of jogging/sports head phones. I am using these for now while I continue my search."
5,Custom-Fit Great for Running,"These are awesome. After shopping around extensively for headphones I could wear while running I stumbled upon these. You can bend the wires to custom fit your ears so they stay while running or whatever - I'm not aware of any other headphone that allows you to do this. For running, I don't want buds that don't let any background noise in and these allow me to also hear what's around me when I run. Also comes in a great case for storage to avoid tangled wires - bonus!"
3,They're alright,"They are ok headphones for the money. The sound isn't all that great, and they didn't fit in my ears, but for $10, they're pretty good."
2,"Great for 4 months, but then...","I've had these for 4 months and have enjoyed them until now. The wires are broken/loose and not working. There is another review with a similar problem at 4.5 months. Not a long lasting product, even with gentle usage."
2,Tinny Sound - No Bass. Ipod Phones better,"Bought these because the Ipod earphones would slip out of my ear while riding. These are very ""tinny"" in sound. Very little bass, lots of screeching. I am back looking at reviews again for a new pair and using the Ipod ones again."
3,Okay for people with larger ears,"I admit I'm rough on most head/earphones. I'm lucky if a set lasts more than 6 months with the sound quality intact. So I look for cheaper sets, so I'm not wasting money constantly buying expensive sets. This sets sound quality is pretty good for the price, and the earbuds themselves (the parts that are actually inserted into your ear) are comfortable. I just have one problem with these. The little hooks that go over the tops of the ears? They are not made for people with smaller ears. They're constantly feeling like they're about to slip over the top of my ear. And the wire where they attach to the earbud isn't really adjustable, so I can't tighten them down. For me, these would have been better without the hooks. They do come with a handy little case to put your earbuds in when you're not using them though, so that was cool."
2,Tried Koss for 4.5 months of disappointment,"I've used several different over-the-ear headphones over the years. This time, I thought I'd give Koss a try (I used to have Sony). They rarely stayed in my ear - there were runs where I had to put it back in every few minutes, something that rarely happened with Sony. The worst though is that after 4.5 months of regular use, the right ear no longer works. I'm going back to Sony."
3,not bad for the money,"you cant expect big sound or any measure of bass in a set such as these. They are ok for what I need them for in the gym. If you work at it a little, you can get them to fit decently, and I have very small ears."
3,Not good for working out,"These headphones sound fine, fit comfortably, and seem well-made, but they have one major flaw: When I work out, I get sweaty. When the sweat drips into the headphones, the sound cuts in and out. This makes them worthless for exercising. If you are planning to use them for commuting or light exercise, you will probably be happy with them. They are terrible for rigorous exercise, however."
1,Too fragile for jogging.,"My wife and I have had ours for several months. They sounded good when they were working, however the gauge of wire that they use is too flimsy to handle the bouncing around of jogging. Eventually one of the wires would develop a break up near the connector. We had two pairs, they both did not last."
3,Close to great,"I bought a replacement for a pair I've had forever. I've gone through probably ten different brands/models of mini headphones looking for the perfect exercise pair. The old pair were great, but it seems like they slightly changed the plastic ""padding"" they had on the wire, and it doesn't fit quite as well. The worst thing is the close but no cigar fit, the best thing is that with the wire ear piece, you really are able to tune the fit more than any other pair I've tried. When these wear out, I'll probably buy another pair, I'll just be sad they don't fit as well as I'd like. The sound is just fine, as much as you could want while riding."
4,headphones,nice headphones can fit to ear so if you wear for awhile you dont get soar ears and if your woking out or running they stay in. bought 4 pair figuring would not last long but still on 1st pair after 3 years.
2,Don't fit small ears well,"First of all, the delivered product was dark colored and didn't look anything like the pictured red/white earphones. They sounded great, but didn't fit AT ALL. The hooks extended way over the top of my ears and I just couldn't make them fit. Gave them to my daughter and she had no luck either."
2,Adequate,"These headphones are kind of chintzy but they work okay. They are basically cheap earbuds with a thin metal loop soldered too the back to go around the ear. The Sony sport headphones provide much better sound quality and comfort (these don't seem to fit as snugly). However, the Sony sport headphones, the one with the plastic loop that goes around your ear, I've owned have never lasted for more than 7 months...hopefully these last longer."
3,"huge buds, good sound","Mine came as described: maroon buds and a nice case. I'm still looking for clip-ons with adjustable hooks. These looked like the wires would bend, but they don't. They stay put if I do, so they'll work at work, but I can't imagine them staying in if I go for a walk."
2,Good sound but bad design,"I think these headphones produce excellent sound. If you are not moving around too much when you use them then I think they are a good choice. However, if you are buying these for workouts I think it would be wise to look elsewhere. The ""bud"" portion of this product is large and heavy compared to the clip so it winds up resting way outside the ear canal and will pretty easily fall out of place. I find myself needing to constantly adjust them while running or at the gym."
4,Good sound and good fit,"I really like these headphones. I was upset when I broke my old headphones because I didn't think I'd find another pair that worked as nicely or fit as well, but these fit the bill. I use these on my Creative Zen, so I listen to music as well as movies. The sound is great for such a low price. I wasn't expecting that. I figured I'd hear a tinny quality, but that wasn't the case at all. I love the way the earclips go around my ears, just like eye glasses. They are better than having earbuds that pull out very easily."
3,Good headphones - but died quickly,"While they worked, the headphones worked well. You can easily bend the earpieces however they are needed to fit your ear and make them stay in place. But, and there's always a but right? But, I ran in these almost daily and I found that they quickly started to rust inside the clear plastic coating on the wire ear-pieces and eventually (2 months? 3?) died completely."
3,"Sporty, but not for running.","I have had these headphones for a few years now, and purchased them with running in mind. They are comfy and great if you're sitting/walking around and want something that fits securely on/around your ear and won't pull off should the cord accidentally snag; BUT,...they are horrible when it comes to exercising. They do not stay in the ear with the up and down motion of running, and I have found them to be more of a hindrance/nuisance (having to continuously tuck them around the ear and back into place). The bud is a bit too big for my ear, and the clips are also too large...wish they came with various sizes, or the clips were able to be bent so I could form them better around my ear."
5,"For running, the only sports phones I can use...","I have small ears, these are the only phones I've found that the ear buds stays put, especially with the piece that wraps around the outside of the ear, which on others I've found are too big to keep them secure on my ears. I'll continue to check out others in case there's something even better out there, but for now these are it for me...& they come with a guarantee, I got a nick in the cord probably in packing them for travel & the company sent me a new set!"
2,"Decent sound, poor fit","For cheap bud earphones, the sound is fine. I'm not expecting much, especially since I only use them for running. But, the buds themselves have this funky oval/diamond shape, and they constantly fall out of my ears, even after I spent a good deal of time adjusting the wire behind-the-ear holders. I'm a relatively big guy, so I assume I have big ears, but these things are even bigger than my ears."
4,please enter a title for your review:,"Great headphones. Earbuds always fall out on me, and a lot of the clips are annoying in one way or another, whether it be they squeese to tight or are difficult to get on; but these are great, i can hardly notice them on, and the quality is pretty good. Unfortunately the right ear stopped working after about a year...and so did my friend's. Hmmm....odd. I think they are still good anyway."
1,Look at other earphones,"If you're looking for earphones for running, these are not the ones.Timeline:1st Day Went running-fell out.2nd Day Adjusted them, went running and they fell out.3rd Day Adjusted them again, went running and they fell out again.4th Day Plugged them into my laptop and there they remain.5th Day Watching a movie, and they fell out.Save you money"
2,They are ok,"I bought these headphones at Best Buy expecting some good sound quality, i was wrong. First off, the bass is far too much, it drownes out all other sounds, and ruins the overall quality. Also, the clips do not fit behind the ear. There is much slack, thus they do not stay on very well. The clips also bend easy."
2,no good,the ear clip is not adjustable (not flexible) and the bud is way too big. Not good for small ears.
1,You can do better for the price with the Sony MdRs,"These things are completely terrible for me. They don't stay in the ear,and actualy fall off when I'm lying on the bench, and the sounds is bad. Stay away"
1,You can find a better product.,"I have sampled about 5 different brands/styles of sport headphones over the last few years. These ""sportclips"" from Koss are the worst. The sound quality is diminshed, the cord is way too long, and the sport clips are not particularly malleable and as such do a poor job of conforming to the ear. Keep looking, almost anything will be a better choice than this product."
2,They don't stay in.,"They work well enough just sitting at my desk at work. The clips will hold them over your ears just fine but they sound rather weak if they aren't in your ears. They seem too big and keep coming out of my ears when I run/rollerblade.Edit after seeing a couple comments after mine:I'll agree they do not fall off my ears because of the clip, which is why I originally thought they'd be good for running. The problem I have is with the actual bud coming out so they are closer to just hanging over my ears. There is a big difference in volume/sound quality when they are pushed tight in my ears compared to what I would consider ""falling out."" When they are not pressed in tight, I have to turn the volume up and they sound more muffled."
3,Great Fit - Poor Sound,"Tried these based on other people's reviews of good running headphones. They fit great around the ear and stay on with no problem while running. However, the sound quality - volume & bass - are very poor. Unfortunately, opened headsets cannot be returned, so I'm stuck with them and had to try another kind."
3,BIG but good,"These Koss KSC22 headphones are a good deal for the money. I think they are a slight improvement in sound over my original Apple ipod earbuds. I bought them for my wife who prefers the earclip type. Problem is they are LARGE and barely fit in my ears much less her smaller ears. So they are now mine. The are very comfortable for long term listening. Isolation is minimal which is actually a plus for my use of them at work. They are NOT bass heavy, but for my background music levels at work, they are clean highs and pleasant sound. Good for the price."
3,Very comfortable - but not very good sound,"I love how comfortable these are, and how well they stay on my ears while I'm active... but the sound quality is weak and tinny, not nearly as rich and full as the Phillips earbuds I was replacing."
3,2.5 out of 5,"I would have to agree with the reviews stating the awkward design of the actual earbud of these. They just do not stay secure no matter how you try to ""bend"" the wire that wraps around your ear. You can shove them in if you try hard enough however you better not twitch a muscle cause when you do they will fall out. If you press the phones to your ear and hold them they sound relatively good. Pretty good highs and mids and decent if a bit muddy lows. If the phones actually stayed in I would give these a 4 of five for their price range."
4,so comfortable,"I found these very comfortable and they stayed in my ears nicely, even when jogging. Eventually one ear stopped working, but I will blame myself for that. I would just shove them in a pocket and wasn't careful with them.They didn't sound very good, but good enough. The comfort and fact that they stayed in my ear while jogging made up for the poor sound."
2,If my ears were bigger...,"...I might be able to give these more stars. I can't comment on the sound quality because these just don't fit well enough to tell. There's no hope of my using them on my runs. I really don't think my ears are unusually small, but if you have large ears you might go ahead and try them."
3,Comfortable but the sound could be better,"Did not find the sound quality to be any better than any other garden variety earbud. Bass response is average which means generally not so good.On the plus side, they are very comfortable and you can wear them for hours without discomfort and the wrap around wires are very handy for exercise. Bottom line - highly recommended for active use but if you need a more full bodied, rounder sound with stong bass and midrange, get another headset."
4,good deal,"sound quality is ok, and it fits my ear fortunately, you can't expect too much for a headphone within this price range anyway."
5,WILL NOT CUT the back of your ear,"These are the best, (and I have tried them all), set of earphones out there for COMFORT.and you can't beat the lifetime warranty. Keep 2 pairs so that if you have to send one in for replacement you don't have to suffer the use of OTHER earphones.I listen to a lot of music and audiobooks and so comfort is key for my needs. and the earbuds fall out for me so I have to have the hook over my ear or a band over/around my head."
3,Little information on adolescents.,"The book provides accurate information on the ADHD child in general, but I found it to have little information on adolescent children. My search for this specific information was the reason I bought it, so I was somewhat disappointed."
2,Highly Disappointed,I am a big fan of train videos. Especially ones that show scenic views of this great country. I have an older video of this same area that is just as clear or better. After viewing this much anticipated video I was really disapointed with the quality of the video. In this day of high definition video one has to wonder why there are so many companies getting away with riping of the customer like this one does. I'd sooner pay double to get a real high def video. I'll have to do more homework before I buy any more like this one.Eric V.
5,Reflects the importance in keeping active as one grows older,This video expresses the importance of an individual keeping active as one grows older. It illustrates no matter what your age there are ways of keeping your body well lubricated with the correct exercise which results in feeling and looking better but most of all lets your whole being perform at its maximum. Great way to get the body moving.
5,"Dimensional Flowers Leaves and Vines May 15, 2002","Dimensional Flowers Leaves and VinesThis is a wonderful book .The directions are easy to follow. I do loom work most of the time so for the directions to be easy enough for me to follow, they have to be good.Using the wonderful leaves patterns from Barbara Grainger's book, I made a necklace of peyote flowers, ndebele and peyote straps . Subsequently, this same necklace won first place in the ""Signs of Spring Challenge"" on About.com as well as winning in the ""Flower Challenge."" Thank you, Barbara! Your leaves made the necklace as beautiful as it is!A winner.Frieda Bates"
3,Expected more.,The pictures are great but the directions are not with the pictures. I have not made any of the designs yet as I need to modify the only pattern I purchased the book for. A disappointment.
1,BIG FAT DISAPPOINTMENT OF A BOOK,"First of all it is more apt to be discribed as a pamplet. This was my first complaint, it is staple bound book. There are a few photos of the endproduct in the center of the book. The idea is to look through the photos find what you want to create and look at the instructions on how to do it. The instructions are in black and white and neither the the illustrations or the instructions are as clear as they could be. The illustrations are crudely drawn and don't cover each step. In the begining of the book she states that she assumes the reader has an understanding of the techniques, but I found even that is not enough to shepard you through her instructions.There are some out of sight bead books out there like Creative Bead Weaving by Carol Wilcox Wells (which is the same price and worth every penny if not more!). Buy that book or any of Vicki Stars, but don't waste your money on this!Nicole"
2,Surprised,I book was what I wanted but very surprised open up the cover to find the book was a personnel message in it to someone by the name of Jan ....... with a message to this person and someones signature. I really did not want a used book that had a personnel message in it and dated. So I am not very happy about this. Havent decided if I want to return this or not. I thought I had purchased a new book not a used one so still following up on that issue.
4,Great Book on Christian Love,"Arch Bishop Fulton Sheen is the man! This book is a ""How To"" manual regarding Christian behavior and attitudes. ABFSheen, with the precision of a surgeon, succinctly hits the high points of most virtues and vices. Too much treasure to document here, but my favorite chapters were Chapter 7.) ""Disciplining Myself for Love"" and Chapter 8.) ""Love of Neighbor in General"". One of my favorite Chapter 8 quotes = ""We are to love our fellowman not because he is lovable, but because God loves him."" How true....How so very true. This book is a quick read at only 160 pages."
3,OK if you like that sort of thing,"The movie - amusing at times, syrupy. It's hard to think of anyone but Robin Williams playing this part. The emotional parts are usually overdone with plinky piano music but I have to admit that the sad bit (won't give anything away) moved me a lot.The DVD - extremely disappointed with this. I assumed this would be widescreen but it isn't - it seems you have to pay an extra four dollars for this disc just to get widescreen as a special feature!"
4,Patch Adams,Patch Adams is one of the few movies I laugh at ever time I watch it. I say that because Robin Williams is so funny!!!
1,Too expensive to rent,"I like the idea of streaming movies, but $4.00 for 1 day is too much. I will probably switch to Redbox."
1,A Painful Movie,"Without a doubt, Patch Adams is one of the most excruciatingly painful movies in recent memory. It should actually feature a warning label for anyone whose blood-sugar level is already high enough. I felt a veritable toothache during many of the scenes in which Robin Williams, who is by now too far gone to realize when he's being insufferable, tries to cheer up terminally ill patients. I would have died gladly after one of his performances, if only to guarantee the impossibility of an encore! Williams is on a downward slope lately, what with What Dreams May Come, Jacob the Liar and this monstrosity. I see a terrific future in standup for this guy."
4,pretty good,"I think this movie was hilarious. Robin Williams, though a little old, made a very convincing Patch Adams. The story was solid and made sense throught the whole movie. One of the downsides of this movie is that at times it gets a little sappy- AND obscene. I would have preferred if they had cleaned up the language a little- and- well, the scene where Robing(AS PAtch) decorates the hospital entrance as a woman's widespread legs, WELL!If it were cleaned up, I would give it 10 stars out of five.(Do the math. it works.)"
3,dvd extra comments,"Liked the movie, but wanted to say if you are buying for the commentary its not great. Or i should say it is difficult to listen to. They did not lower the movie sound low enough to hear what the director is saying and that makes to very hard to concentrate on what he is saying."
5,Patch Adams is a great movie!,I saw this movie in the theaters and I enjoyed every minute of it. It's one of my favorite Robin Williams movie. Everytime when it comes on Starz I always watch it. This movie is not boring at all it's a good movie. I think for those of ya'll who hadn't seen it should watch it because I think it's great.
1,Evil Dr. Mork Kill World!,"I already had opinions about Mr. Williams (and his sickness that people misinterpret as humor), but I made a point to watch this ""movie"" three times before drawing any conclusions. Fairness is an essential part of who Como is. My conclusion is that if Mr. Williams were really a doctor he would be smart enough to know that it is futile to try to kill the world with his movies. But, in my humility, Mr. Williams is doing an ok job at it. During my second viewing, I ruined my new leather sofa with glass shards from my popcorn bowl...but these are pointless details. I simply ask: Why does Robin Williams want to kill the world with this relentless attack of disease-spore ""movies""? In case I haven't made myself clear--and Como isn't always clear--I didn't like this ""movie"", nor it's disease. I give one star to this movie in the hope that the star will soon become a black hole. But that's Como!"
5,"Awesome movie, lots of emotions","I'm a huge fan or Robin Williams and have seen this movie in the past, decided to order it and add to my collecion. Always just like seeing it for the first time, lots of emotions some happy some sad."
5,Patch Adams,"I always love tell my kids about people that are ""real"". Patch is a person who really did build the ""gutzunthite"" (sp?)institute to help others. I try to show them that its all about giving and not by getting!"
3,"A sometimes funny, sometimes touching story.","Okay. Forget the hype... As it stands, this a good movie... Not great, just good. Williams, of course, is fabulous. He nails the character to perfection. Trouble is, the character of Patch Adams, either real or on screen, is not that interesting. Sure, he's unique. But, that's it. Of course, there are some hilarious moments, like when a bunch of gyneacologists are visiting the college, Patch makes the entrance into the female anatomy. (you have to see it) And there are touching moments as well, like when his girlfriend dies and he is on a cliff contemplating suicide. Very powerful. But, these moments are too infrequent. The rest is predictable. All in all, it's worth seeing if only for Williams' performance."
2,"forget the kleenex, bring a pillow instead","Before the late film critic Gene Siskel died, he named Patch Adams the worst movie of 1998--I now know why. This is a heavy-handed, incredibly manipulative movie that somehow most everyone bought into and loved. Unbelievable. Robin Williams overacts so much that you can almost hear him screaming for an Oscar. This isn't the type of film that wins awards, it's the type that's made to win them."
5,A true heartwarmer!,"Patch Adams will forever be the most astounding and influencial movie I have ever seen. If you could have any one video in your collection, let this be the one. Before I had even seen this movie I had planned on being a doctor. But I didn't have such an extensive insight on just how much one can change and influence a patient's life for the better. Now I have a true and deep yearning to be a doctor of health as well as a doctor of love. Please watch this film with an open heart. It's a true story that will stay with you forever and ever."
3,This was a Best Picture nominee?,"Sure, Williams was fun to watch, as usual. And it made me feel good. And I'm sure that the real Dr. Addams is an admirable and courageous person. But so many of the characters are predictable stereotypes (the mean hospital head and William's young love interest, to name two) and cliches abound. Don't watch this if you have a low sugar tolerance."
4,This was an awesome movie.,I thought that Robin Williams played a great part in this movie. I expected a good performance but not that good.
1,This movie stinks on ice,"I do think Robin Williams is a unique talent but his messianic complex is getting out of hand. I am not suprised that this manipulative piece of fluff was made or that it is bad, but the adoring reception given by much of the American public astonished me. However, the number of people who loved this film does give insight into condition of the American political system and how we wind up with the leaders we do. For this film, there should be a zero star category."
1,"A sad, sad commentary on public taste","This movie is intended to be a charming, witty, uplifting tale of a doctor who sees the whole person in his patients. What it ends up being is a marathon session of a guy being a dumb jerk to the professionals around him. I thought the part where his cult-like views get his girlfriend killed was especially charming. It was a nice touch that he feels sorry for himself and glosses over the fact that it was his ... world-view that got her killed.This movie was bad, not for the style or the directing. It is bad because of the terrible dogmatic hippiness of its message. This ""fight the establishment"" [material] wasn't useful in the 60's and it is equally trite and puerile now."
1,Mentally Senile and Challenged,"There's nothing funny about this short-sided comedy. The characters, especially Williams, acted so mentally challenged that it makes you want to hate this movie. Ridiculous is the thought about this movie."
3,"Comedy? no, it is not","If you are looking to laugh, go elsewhere. Why this is advertised as a comedy, I will never know. If you want a good cry and a healthy dose of social outrage,then you'll enjoy this. But, then why not pick up William's better effort, Awakenings? Patch Adams is not a bad film, if it could have decided what genre to be in, it would have been better. This may be an interesting true story, but it may have been better left as a TV movie, or better yet a thought provoking essay from the likes of Hugh Downs or Barbra Walters."
1,Patch Awful,"People were hung at Nuremburg for less than this crime against humanity. I found it addictively appalling, in its cringingly predictable and patronising plot, script, music and Robin Williams playing his usual so-brilliant-he's-nearly-insane-but-wacky-and-all-too-humane schtick.And then the only fit woman gets murdered and it's all over ickily washed over in about 5 minutes, while Adams gets off a medicine-no-licence rap (aside from theft of hospital supplies) with some illogical rant to the gallery. Evil that got one star off me only so I could post it."
2,Not Robin Willians best,"Come one people, this movie wasn't as good as everyone thinks it is. It has its moments, but in the end, fails to deliver a good movie. As usual, there is the always funny Robin Williams. but his eccentric and overating ways seem to get old after the endless string of unrealistic situations. If you're a fan of Robin Williams, you might enjoy this, if not, steer clear."
5,Simplly overwelming and heartwarming,"This movie touches my heart to the core.Whoever hasn't seen this movie has to see it. It makes you think about other people, and your self. It just makes you think so much that once after you see the movie you just get up in tears. It is the best movie I have see before. If you are the conceded type, than you need to see this movie and then you will only think about others and not you so much. This movie is just woderful. Who ever hasn't seen this movie just has to, it's the best movie ever."
5,"A great Dramaty, best I've seen in a long time.","Patch Adams was the greatest movie this year. It gives me chill bumps just thinking about the movie. It was a great mix of a comedy and drama, I call it a dramaty. I recomend this movie to every one woman and men. It will really make you think about the people you love. Don't ever take any thing ror granted you don't know when you'll lose somethig. If you have lost something life gos on and they'll always be with you."
4,Robin is superb!,"Robin Williams made me laugh and cry throughout the film and I came out enlightened and ready to face life's challenges with an open heart and mind. Monica Potter is refreshing to watch and when her character died, I felt like I will explode with sadness. After watching this film, I appreciated butterflies more than I did before. I pray that there'll be more Dr. ""Patch"" Adams in the whole world to care for the sick and dying patients."
4,What's so bad about feeling good?,"Sure the set up of this movie is very predictable. Sure Robin Williams is once again playing the lovable, foolish good guy we've seen so often before. And sure, the good guys win and we all cry in the end. So what is so bad about that? I loved this flick."
1,"Robin, go back to Ork","Would YOU want this guy as your doctor? I didn't think so. This movie is bad, so don't watch it. Watch anything else, even HOOK if you want to see Robin in a better movie. PLEASE"
2,WHY DOES EVERYONE LIKE THIS MOVIE?,"THIS MOVIE WAS EXTREMELY BORING.A LITTLE FUNNY BUT STILL BADI DONT EVEN WANT ANYBODY TO MENTION IT AGAIN,IT WAS SO STUPID"
1,Robnoxious Williams,109 minutes of insufferably nauseating shtick delivered by one of the most shameless sell-out hacks to ever disgrace the entertainment industry.
3,"If I were a producer, I will make it in a different way.","The movie was not bad. It depicted Patch's school life in more detail than the book ""GESUNDHEIT!"". But if I were a producer, I will make it in a different way. I think what people want to know about Patch is what kind of a doctor he is, how he cures patients with humor and laughter. There were some scenes which Patch cures patients as a clown. But in the movie he was a student. What we want to see is Patch's doctor life. So I will depict Patch's doctor life."
1,this has to be the worst movie ever made,"i hated this movie so much its almost as bad as ""10 things I hate about you"" if u like it u have no taste in movies"
5,I LOVE this movie!,"Patch Adams is my all-time Favorite Movie. It has been since the first time I saw it years ago and everytime I rewatch this movie, I get to feel the exact feelings that I felt the first time I watched it. It's touching, heart warming and Inspiring!"
3,"GREAT STORY, FLAWED BY FLAT CHARACTERS!","What's not to like about this film, Robin Williams plays yet another caring doctor who wants only to help people. It's all strangely familiar.....if you've seen 'Awakenings', a much better film if you ask me. I did enjoy this predictable film, but the character's have no depth. We have the kooky crazy people, the mean head physician and so on and so on. This would not be a problem if this was a comedy, but with the subject matter at hand, it really is a drama. It's based on a true story, about a man who thinks outside the box. I love people who think outside the box, if only the director had.........it could have been an exceptional film, as it is, it's a decent feel good film with a rather uneven tone. The DVD has a very good transfer."
2,Sentimental and Trite,"Yuck, yuck, yuck. A blatant rip-off of two of Williams' earlier (and much better) films, 'Good Morning Vietnam' and 'Dead Poet's Society'. I won't ruin the plot for anyone who still wants to see this waste of film, but it includes a number of themes that were explored in nearly identical ways in the former movies (I almost expected everyone in the courtroom scene to start yelling 'O captain, my captain.')."
2,"Not Terrible, Just Awful","Robin Williams in a formulaic tearjerker? What a revolutionary concept! Williams's talent is wasted in yet another dreadful stinker here. It's a good story, but the script kills any potential it may have had. I miss the days when Williams occasionally put out a great movie that demonstrated his talent (Garp, Dead Poets, Fisher King, etc.). Lately it's just one stinker after another. Sigh...Someone please give me back the two hours of my life wasted on this tripe!"
5,I was inspired to change the world after seeing Patch Adams,I was inspired to change the world after seeing Patch Adam
1,This movie was STUPID!!,"As I said above ""This movie was STUPID!!"" It was trying to make you cry over, and over again. It is bad film making at work.Don't wast your time and money!"
3,Tolerable,"Robin Williams looks absolutely nothing like Patch Adams. That's one downside.However, I question that every bit of this movie is true. Most of it is probably over-dramatized. In other words, it probably stretches the truth a little.It wasn't a bad movie, altogether. It was somewhat inspiring...except for one thing. Where does this guy come off blaming God for all of his problems? I was sickened to see him stand on the edge of a cliff and shake his fist towards heaven, a look of hatred on his face, defiantly growling to God, ""Why didn't you create compassion on the seventh day?"" This is pure blasphemy. It would have been more entertaining if, having completed this statement, he was struck by a lightening bolt."
1,Painful Like 1000 Knives Stabbing My Gentle Brain,Who does Robin Williams think he is? If he were here right now I'd tell him a thing or two and set him straight. Stupid movie.
5,PATCH ADAMS IS ONE OF ROBIN WILLIAMS BEST!!!!!!!!!!,"THE MOVIE PATCH ADAMS HAS TOUCHED ME IN A WAY NO OTHER FILM HAS BEFORE! ROBIN PLAYS A REAL LIFE DOCTOR WHO PROOVES COMEDY CAN HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE IN NEED OF HEALING! YOU SEE I WAS BORN WITH CP AND HAVE IN HOSPITALS ON AND OFF AND I NEVER SEEN SOMEONE WHO WOULD GO OUT OF THEIR WAY AS MUCH AS PATCH DOES TO HELP OTHERS! THIS IS ONE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY!TO THOSE OF YOU WHO THINK THIS IS FAKE, IT IS NOT! I MET THE REAL PATCH AND HE IS JUST LIKE THE MOVIE PORTRAID HIM TO BE!!!!"
5,"every single song is da bomb, no1 blows it up like dat","i am from PA(their town), u are about to hear the realest from our reality, all in a rhyme and UGK is the best at what they do"
2,My Blueberry Nights by Norah Jones,"I liked the one song on the CD by Norah Jones, but the rest I didn't like at all. I saw the movie, and didn't notice the music that much, but thought it had to be good with Norah Jones. Right? Well, perhaps others will like it, and can disagree with me. Some have said she's not a good actress - but it was a quiet little movie, and she fits it perfectly. Will pass the CD along to someone who likes that kind of music. I honestly thought before ordering it that the entire album would be her songs, but I need to learn to look more carefully into what I order."
5,Really Reassuring,There aren't too many books out there that deal with the aftershocks of becoming a new parent this well. I found Kitzinger very reassuring and have referred back to a number of chapters multiple times in the weeks and months after childbirth. Strongly recommended!
1,Depressing and morbid.,"Don't buy this book. Each chapter seems to focus on the negative aspects of birth and having a baby. It's depressing, morbid, and has little practical information."
5,Mr Smooth,"Anyone who hasn't sat quietly and listened to Brendan Gallagher's smooth, evocative songs/lyrics is missing out! Michael Galeazzi's beautiful double bass and Stuart Eadie' drums/percussion tie the songs together sweetly! 'Last Stop' wasn't available in Oz when I was looking for it - Amazon had a couple of copies at a nice price! Check out anything by Karma County/Brendan Gallagher -you won't be disappointedMick"
2,Quality Slipping Away,"I recently purchased a set of the Auto Ventshade #94152 vent shades to put on a vehicle I just purchased. I have had these vent shades on all of my cars for many years. In my younger days I put the metal versions on my relative's cars. They should come as a factory option.This recently purchased set was a total disaster. The packaging was not crushed, but the shades were distorted from the factory shrink wrap. The shades almost lay against the glass and they do not fit properly. The retaining clips were as hard as a rock and were a real bear to install. The glue strips will not stick after 24 hours of waiting for them to set. I am extremely disappointed. Perhaps they have been in storage too long.Charlie"
1,Pretentious Tripe,Despite its numerous accolades I found this book a most tedious slog. It may be the longest 184 pages I've ever forced myself through. It consists of nearly endless descriptive passages of unappealing characters on an incredibly thin and most unsatisfying narrative frame. I found it to be an exercise in florid and fatuous pretension - a complete waste of time.
2,Overrated florid monstrosity,"Two readings straight through, back to back, and I still couldn't figure out what anyone sees in this overwrought piffle."
1,Wrong disk right packaging,"I have ordered this twice for my teenager learning to drive. I had to return the first one because the disk and box were labled correctly, but the disk plays How to Be A Better Parent in 30 Minutes. My replacment disk had the same problem. I want my underaged son to learn about drinking and driving and the ill effects, not how to be a better parent. Maybe in 5 years or more he will need parenting skills."
4,Great For the teens...,This is a great book about a typical teenaged jewish girl who is confused about pleasing herself or pleasing her parents... Everyone around her has different opinions about who she should date or if she should even date at all. Greatly recomended for the romantic loving teenager!
5,A book which swept me along,"A fantastic book. I found myself either reading it, thinking about reading it or just thinking about it - until it was done. And then I missed it."
4,"Plot twists, quirky characters, skillful writing","This is a fictionalized story of a real double murder that took place in 1843 in Canada. ""Alias Grace"" is my first Margaret Atwood book, but it won't be my last. The characters are interesting, and I came to feel as though I knew them--or as much as one could know them (hint). The plot makes some unexpected twists, and the author's effective use of foreshadowing kept me guessing at what would happen next and how the story would end. In the 2 days it took me to read this book, I became rather attached to the somewhat quirky and mysterious main character, Grace Marks. I also learned some interesting things about life in the Victorian Era. I highly recommend this book."
3,Curious Grace...Atwood's big set up,"Believe it or not...this was my first Atwood experience. I enjoyed the curious and mysterious nature of Grace, but got bored with her teasing. This constant play with no rewards was tiring and it was finally a relief to put Grace to rest. Atwood's style was most captivating and I will probably read something by her in the future. However, I will trust in the old stand-by of reading the first paragraph for interest sake and then moving on if I have to. Overall, if I was stranded on a desert isle I would probably choose to read this book rather than take another nap."
4,"Good, but not her best.","Up until the last 100 pages, this is a brilliant novel. But then Atwood makes a huge plot mistake and essentially undoes all the groundwork she's so painstakingly laid"
2,Detailed but Ponderous,"The opening chapters filled me with hope for the remainder of the novel. The language was lyrical and satisfying, with an intrguing story which, one hoped, would reach a decent climax and conclusion. However, as the narrative progressed, we're overwraught with unnecesary detail, page after page of unreal recollection and boring prose. The book segways into a disappointing monotony which leaves the reader cold, no longer interested as to the fate of the protagonist. What's more, I found the book frustrating to read because of Atwood's inability to portray male characters accurately. She seems to believe that every man walks around with highly debauched and fetishised views of women. The ending is disappointing, yet somehow satisfying. It takes a good deal of effort to drag yourslef through the closing chapters, but here, at least, the narrative has some direction. The book is very long, unnecessarily long."
4,"Entrancing, but abruptly ended","I found myself unable to put this book down andeven risked carsickness as I read it on theroad while,luckily, my husband drove. Eachcharacter was explored enough for us to care,but I always maintained the sense that wedidn't have the full story...which thecharacters themselves may not have known either!Ms. Atwood is extremely talented.The resolution of the story, however, felt quickand neat...much out of the style of the restof the book. Why the sudden tidy resolution ofeach thread when so much of the bookfocused on the disorganized, random nature ofthe truth, or even more to the point,reality? I worry that Ms. Atwood feared thather readers wouldn't 'get it' if she let theending progress as the rest of the novelhad. Too bad.Still, a great novel overall and one that I willrecommend."
4,Atwood Turns Out Another Winner,"I've never been a huge fan of fiction. Biographies, history, reference and non-fiction fill my bookshelves. However, of the few fiction writers I read, admire and respect, Margaret Atwood is my favorite. I've read every one of her works with Alias Grace being the latest. It's a definite winner. How many authors can make you care about and root for an alleged cold-blooded murderess? Atwood has that wonderful talent for making her characters a part of the reader's life, like a best friend, and that includes Grace Marks. I found myself wishing I could invite her and Dr. Jordan to dinner because they were so intriguing. The book takes you on an honest and fascinating journey into the mind of a compelling woman. Loved the book! Love Atwood"
2,Not Atwood's best,"This is not Atwood's best book by a long stretch. 'The Handmaids Tale', 'the Robber Bride', and the especially exquisite 'The Blind Assassin' are much more enjoyable. This book is slow, and does not have the wonderful turns of phrase that her other books have.While she does a good job of leaving the reader guessing as to the guilt or innocence of Grace, the question, of course, cannot be answered (being a true story) and leaves you disappointed. The prelude to the crime (Grace's history) is the best part of the book."
2,Played Out,"You've read this book already. Trust me.Alias Grace is too pretentious and long-winded, even for Atwood. I could see others enjoying this, but it's too tame and contemplative for me. There is no need to badger about her other wonderful stories, so I'll stop here."
2,A suspense thriller this is not!,"I read The Handmaid's Tale and hated it. I bought this book because the newspaper reviews were terrific. I struggled to get through it. The prose of course is excellent. Otherwise I would rate this book a 2. This was not a mystery. It was not a suspense thriller. I guess it is a non-fiction documentary disguised as a novel in order to attract a larger audience! For Victorian age descriptions and characters and plot , I prefer Anne Perry."
2,Alias Grace:A Ovel,"Very slow start, faster finish. Margaret Atwood is not a favorite of mine. Read it for book club, not by choice."
2,Predictable story line,"This story of Victorian age women done wrong, although true, is much too often told. I won't reveal the twists and turns, but, at least in the book on tape version, there are few true surprises. That it is based on a true story makes it more interesting. But, reliance on dream symbolism and hypnosis are overwrought and overused techniques."
2,Frustrating,"Whereas Oryx and Crake fasinated me, Alias Grace frustrated me. There are too many points of view and too many different writing styles for the book to flow from start to finish. Grace as a character bored me. Simon the doctor was the only one who really got my attention but his scenes were few and far between."
1,Has the world gone crazy?,"I don't know what all these people are talking about--something is strange here. This is one of the most tedious, boring and mundane reads EVER. How anyone could think this book is ""excellent"" baffles the mind--the plot goes nowhere (slowly) which is a divine form of literary torture. Trust me, this book sucks!"
5,very clever book!,"Fantastic recounting of the life and trial of Grace Marks. Loved all the quotes and poems from the newspapers of the time regarding Grace and her supposed lover, James McDermott. Margaret Atwood's use of language and imagery were brilliant and I can't wait to read more from this author."
5,Alias Grace,"The audio cassette of this book is worth a close listening. Elizabeth McGovern reads Grace's thoughts and words with a lilting, musical Irish accent, at once intriguing, beguiling. Grace is poor woman living in the mid 1800s who may or may not be a murderess. While incarcerated, she proves to be an interesting psychological study for a doctor investigating the mysteries of the brain. Atwood's stories always contain mysteries, of the mind, of the imagination, and of other dimensions. This one is no exception."
4,remarkably strange,it was boring at the beginning but it got really interesting as I read on. I recomend this book to any one.
4,Margaret Atwood always pleases,"This was a good read - I always enjoy Atwood's novels, but this one (based on true events) was especially pleasing to me - largely because it allowed the story to unfold in ways that left me open to draw on my own thoughts on the subject as I was reading. Atwood never force-feeds ideas - she allows the flower to open in its own way and we are allowed to admire every stage of the process.. Atwood's use of words and her enunciation is, as always, perfect. Part of the joy of any Atwood novel is the opportunity to roll and wallow in the written word, the quirky turn-of-phrase and the beauty of new ideas expressed with delightful good humor. In the end, I am coated in this (like a pig in mud) and happy to be so satisfied."
5,Nonfiction Fiction at its Finest,"Rather than repeating all the very eloquent sentiments expressed in quite a few of the reviews for ""Alias Grace"", I'll just say, quite simply, this is a fantastic book. Working on several different levels, Atwood delivers a gripping story, interesting characters, and a relevant social commentary. At once humorous and heart-wrenching, I had a hard time putting it down.Wether you're an Atwood fan, a fan of historical fiction, or you're just looking for a good book to read, this novel will deliver. Highly recommended!"
4,Expertly written,"You really have to give credit to the author for this book. The Canadian society of the nineteenth century is portrayed with detail, thanks to the research carried out by the talented Mrs. Atwood. This clever writer uses many techniques which contribute to the originality and the uniqueness of this novel, like shifting the point of view from Grace to Dr. Jordan, or allowing us to read the letters exchanged by the various characters of the book, which I really enjoyed. I also liked the idea of including the transcripts from Grace's confession and other accounts, which neatly frame the story into the real events.Why not five stars, then? I am not sure, but I think that the murder story did not really grip me that much, and Grace was a slightly annoying character. I was much more interested in Dr. Jordan, his findings, doubts and fantasies.Overall, a great book, wonderfully written and highly recommendable."
4,Fictionalized Account of a Notorious 19th Century Murder,"This is an interesting and well-written novel that is a fictionalized account of anotorious murder that occurred in 19th century Canada. Atwood embarks on asoul-searching recreation of the crime through the eyes of the convicted mur-derer, Grace Marks, as she talks with her psychologist. I enjoyed this book alot as I have Atwood's other novels."
3,Slow going but rewarding at times,"It's the middle of the 19th century in post-rebellion Upper Canada, and Grace, the heroine of the story, gets implicated in the murder of a landowner and his mistress. Grace is a hard character to know; is she a simpleton or cunning? Is she hiding a huge secret or is she resigned to being wrongfully convicted? There are other interesting characters, especially the doctor who interviews Grace at length, while at the same time confronting his own demons. There is so much bleakness shown in the small towns in Upper Canada in this time, the struggles of the poor, especially the fate of Grace's friend who becomes pregnant. That bleakness is to be expected from an Atwood novel of course.Overall, it was a slowly paced novel which suffered in comparison to Atwood's The Blind Assassin in my opinion. Still, it is a worthwhile read and well written."
2,Margaret Atwood's cure for insomnia,"This book was ordinary and a bit boring. It wasn't thrilling or unusual in any way--which is why I read Margaret Atwood. It really didn't make me think--it read very much like a documentary. The pychiatrist didn't really add to the story, in fact, he subtracted from it. The prose is beautiful, which is the only reason why I finished the novel But, if you are expecting Margaret Atwood's typical style of weaving an intricate, chilling yet realistic plot, and shocking you with her vision of reality--this is not the novel to read. It was a disappointment."
2,"Beautiful cover, horrible plot.","I am a huge fan of Margaret Atwood's. ""Alias Grace,"" however, is a large disappointment. The psychiatrist is boring, Grace is undefined and underdeveloped, and the ending is completely unsatisfying. The only reason I haven't sold it at a garage sale is because the cover is gorgeous. This novel is not worthy of the Atwood name. Read ""Handmaid's Tale"" or ""Cat's Eye"" instead"
3,do read,"When I first started reading this novel, I wasn't sure what to think. But I am glad I read through it. It's beautifully written, and very interesting. Especially when you know it's based on an actual murder case. Grace Marks was actually imprisoned and then pardoned. I love the way this book weaves a story around all that and makes it seem so believable."
5,This rates up there with Memoirs of a Geisha. It's great!,"I love the way Margaret Atwood tells a story. The main character, Grace Marks, is innocent, yet also full of depth and understanding. Atwood's writing style is exemplary; every sentence, every paragraph is beautifully written. I find myself reading certain chapters over and over again. A truly great read by a talented author. This book, along with Memoirs of a Geisha, are the best books I've read this year. I'm looking for suggestions about other books that read this well."
4,Amazing Atwood!,"Alias Grace is a great novel. I reviewed for my local libraryand when I saw the size of it, I thought this is going a longand really boring book. As they say, appearances are deceiving.In fact, the book is thought-provoking and intriguing. You can'tstop yourself from turning the page. You wouldn't believe how manynights I was up to 3 or 4 in the morning because I couldn't put thebook down.The only problem I found with the story was at the end, I felt theauthor was grasping for material slightly. The book could have been5 to 10 pages shorter.Anyway, read the book! That's an order! Margaret Atwood has neverbeen at her best!"
4,I did like this book,"I read Alias, Grace while on vacation and finished it in about 3 days. Margaret Atwood has a commanding, lyrical style that always captures my attention. Other readers seemed concerned about whether she was quilty or not. But I found the language and story interesting enough so that her guilt or innocence was beside the point."
5,Great Journey of an enigmatic woman,"Chosen as book of the month for Book club. My big mistake was to get home late from our meeting, get into bed and open this book!!!! Three days later (who knows who fed the children and drove them to school) I emerged from the book. Margret Atwood has captured the time and social structure of the period. Imagery was called to the fore with her descriptions of seaboard life, life in service and especially the quilts used as metaphors. Grace was surely the sanest character in the book, doctors, charlatens, women with drug habits, lawyers with overinflated ego's, the irony of the priviliged classes judging of sanity. However the ending to the book was slightly disappointing, I really did not need to know what happened after she left the confines of prison, Grace was free and perhaps that was all the reader needed to know."
3,"I WAS NOT EXTREMELY EXCITED BY THIS BOOK, BUT WAS PLEASED.","I WAS NOT EXEREMELY EXCITED BY THIS BOOK, BUT WAS PLEASED WITH THE OUT COME. I THOUGHT THE MANNER OF THR WRITING A BIT HARD TO READ,GOING FROM LETTERS TO HER SPEAKING TO THE DOCTOR SPEAKING ETC. THE STORY LINE WAS GOOD AND IT REALLY GAVE AN INSIGHT TO THAT DAY AND TIME.I WOULD SUGGEST THIS BOOK TO OTHERS."
3,An excellent read with a disappointing ending,Our book club read this and it stimulated an excellent discussion. The book reads easily and keeps you gripped. The last 100-150 pages are disappointing with a rather contrived ending. Why did Jerimiah's prison visit come to nothing? Is it supposed to keep the unsolved murder mystery going? Most of our 10 book club members felt a sense of frustration as they completed the final chapters. We also felt the need to re-read them in case we'd missed something!!
4,Quite Intriguing,"I am a college student, and I was brought to this book by my Poetry professor who raved about it. I was certainly not disappointed. This book was very interesting to read, and it kept me on my toes. I think one of the best things about it, is that no one really knows what happened. The senario really realled me in in the first place, but the text and dialouges that are both historically accurate and created using the available sources kept me coming back to reading the novel. I would reccommend this book to all."
4,Harshly Revealing and Tenderly Written: A Masterpiece,"Alias Grace is a beautiful story; its graceful prose wraps around the reader and pulls you in to a narrative that always hovers around the border of sanity and reality. The heroine, Grace Marks, is less her own character than a mirror that reflects the hidden thoughts and fantasies of those around her. Readers and characters alike can be judged by how they perceived her: cold-blooded murderess? vile seductress? innocent child? fresh, delicate young woman? The double role in both her gender and her class place Grace in a position vulnerable to the imaginations and judgements of the rest of her highly-stratified Victorian society. Atwood has created a book that exposes the hypocrisies and the archetypal fantasies of Grace's time and ours. A masterpiece."
4,In These Times is the best of the left,"If you are looking for an informative monthly on the left In These Times (ITT) offers thought-provoking commentary and articles that are pithy but not skimpy (a characteristic I sometimes find of the weekly The Nation).Most importantly, ITT reports on labor every issue, an important component of the left, that is often neglected by other magazines of the left.In These Times is a magazine that may be harder to find in a library. If you are interested, I suggest first visiting their website which allows you to read portions of the current magazine without paying anything.The price for the magazine is very reasonable, and I personally find the magazine content more diverse and interesting than The Progressive."
2,A Magazine for Activists,"I just finished my first issue and am not so crazy about it. I consider myself pretty liberal, but this is waaayy left of where I'm at. It's not that I disagree with any of the positions the magazine takes, its just that it is very slanted in its opinion (and it is pretty much ALL opinion) and seems targeted toward people who are active activists. I like to be informed, but I prefer to hear all sides of an issue so I can make an informed decision. I was hoping for a news magazine that goes a little more in depth than, say, Time Magazine. But this doesn't seem so much a news magazine as it is a progressive/liberal opinion magazine. It is well written, but not what I was hoping for."
5,EXCELLENT READ,AM EXCELLENT READ. GOOD REPRESENTATION OF THE TIME PERIOD AND THE STORY IS COMPELLING. WELL WRITTEN WITH GOOD CHARACTER DEPTH.
3,Good quality,"They are well made. It feels like they are big, but serving wares are supposedly made that way, I think."
4,"Should be titled ""Beginning Oracle 9i Programming""","In the usual Wrox style, this is a well-rounded introductory book on Oracle programming, with detailed, reader-friendly discussions on architecture and many ""Try it out"" exercises.That being said, the book concentrates so much on 9i that if you have installed 8i (or perhaps even Personal Oracle 9i) then you might be discouraged by frequent references and exercises for things you won't be able to do. According to Oracle, 9i Enterprise for Win2K requires 512M of RAM (although other sources indicate that it will run in 256M). The OTN download is around 1.5G (approximately 3 CDROMs worth), or you can request the CDs from Oracle at otn.oracle.com.I would have preferred to see separate sections and exercises that concentrated on 9i-specific details. There are still plenty of features common with previous Oracle releases to support a general-purpose Beginning Oracle book.Recommended, with the above-mentioned caveat."
3,"Not bad, but doesn't cover Java programming with Oracle ...","This books isn't bad on PL/SQL, but if you want to write Java programs with Oracle you'll also need a JDBC book."
5,Great phone,I Had this phone for 3 years t is the best phone ever hadTo day my phone is mess up a bit (dropped it lot) still works and it came with 2 battries anyone who buys a phone shold buy a samsung phone they are great.
4,Samsung and T-Mobile are great!,"I have had this phone since its first released sometime in 2002/2003. Until today (2005), this phone still works as great as it was a brand new phone. The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda). I know how to activate it but I still do not know whether it is capable of anything, like sending and receiving data.Other than that, this phone has gone around many places in the world with me: China (mainland), Hongkong, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia.With T-Mobile great service. This phone is truely a world phone."
5,Big Ball of String by Marion Holland,"I have the original book, ""A Big Ball of String"", that was written and illustrated by Marion Holland (copyright 1958). This book, a family favorite, has been enjoyed by three generations of our family. It has been used so much that it is literally falling apart. Even at 22, I find myself picking it up for a good laugh.The curious little boy in this story goes on an adventure, finding a ""good thing"" to do with his big ball of string. I laugh every time I read it. Especially funny, is that he spends a lot of time out of bed, using the string to help him stay ""in"" bed. The rhymes and phonetics of this book are clever and catchy. I give this book a two thumbs up!!!!"
5,Inspires Creativity For Life!,"This is definitely my favorite book from my childhood...I read it over and over and over...still have it (very worn!) and it has resonated through my whole life! As a kid, I also had a ball of string and loved making things out of whatever I could find, too! I have been motivated by this book's powerful and positive message to explore many mediums of creativity throughout my life. Like the boy in the book, you can just see how fun it is!!! My latest creative venture is passing the torch to the next generation of creative kids through a recycling and creativity-inspiring TV show called ""Ms. Mola's Make-ola!"" - find us on Facebook or at [...] & join the creative fun! My hope is that every child receive this book's message in their life - ""I can do anything...!"" - and be inspired to create all kinds of wonderful inventions that can change their world and ours!"
3,Skill Required,The title would indicate that this book might be easy for most musicians with some skills on the violin to take up and have fun fiddling. I have found this is not the case and considerable technical skills are needed to make the music sound good.
3,Large selection of tunes,"I appreciate having such a large selection of fiddle tunes, but wish they were organized by type (Irish, Bluegrass, etc.) rather than alphabetically. If I'm trying to learn a new style it's a lot harder to find the songs I want to play. That said, there's a lot of music here for $16. A spiral binding would have been nice - it's hard to keep the book open on the stand."
4,Everything you'd need.,"I'm a budding fiddler. Needed this book because it is often mentioned in bluegrass circles. Most of the songs do not require a page turn, but a few do. If I were to criticize anything, it would be the songs that require a page-turn. I could use slightly larger print too, but that's kind of unique to me and my wacky eyes. Other than that, this book is exactly as advertised. Very good."
2,Cheap Binding,"I purchased the Fiddlers Fakebook at least 10 years ago. It came with a plastic comb binding, something that is very much desired by musicians. I just purchased another copy as a gift for some friends and I was not pleased to see the plastic comb binding has been replaced with a standard book binding. It is very difficult to get a book with standard book binding to open flat on a music stand. Now I have to take the book to Kinkos and pay another $7 to have it cut and install either a plastic comb or plastic ring binder."
3,Product picture beware!,"When ordering this item i read the reviews, looked at the picture, and have seen the book in person. TO my dismay when i opened the box the book was not spiral bound but had your standard book binding with a slightly larger spine margin. The wider margin allows for you to keep the book open with ease however does not allow for folding the book in half like the spiral version."
4,For Tin Whistle,"I got this book for the tin whistle. You can probably pay 3/4 of the tunes as written on a D whistle. The others either dip too low or are in nasty keys for the instrument. Some really good songs, but a lot of average ones too."
4,Enjoying the different music,"As a professional violinist, I am enjoying playing through many of the songs. Each excerpt is short and sweet, so depending on who your audience is, this is a quick learn."
5,Number One Resource for Old Time tunes !,"I play old-time fiddle tunes on guitar, my wife plays fiddle, and over my 40 years of playing and our 30 years of marraige we've gathered quite a few fiddle books. This is without question our number one resource for tunes.The arrangements all very solid -- good to go as is, or good foundations for building your own arrangement. Transcriptions are based on recordings that are well-known in the Old-Time / Bluegrass / Irish community. I have found no idiosyncratic or ""strange"" arrangements here. This book is my first source when I'm working on a tune for a gig and my constant companion at jams and picking get-togethers.If you play Old-Time fiddle tunes this should be your number one purchase. ""O'Neill's Music of Ireland"" should probably be second. If you are focused on Irish music -- just reverse those two. The Fake Book includes guitar chords. O'Neill's does not."
2,Picture presents wrong perception,I chose this book based on the review I read and the picture showed it's a spiral bound book. To my disappointment when I received the book was not spiral bound but had the standard book binding with normal paper weight. There is no differences than other paper music score book except the book has 302 pages which make it harder to place in your music stand.
5,excellent,this book reflects kristi's commitment to excellence in everything she does. she is Miss Perfect and so is her book. a 10 in technical merit and presentation.
5,i just love his music,"marvin sease is my idol his songs and music is the only one i enjoy listening to everyday he is a great artists,the best ever.i loved the songs i've reviewed."
2,The a0900 first base glove,If u want a better first base glove then the ones u get at like dick's and champs this is one of the better gloves but not the best. The best would be the A2000 first base glove. If your son plays alot of baseball like 60 games a year this is not the glove u need for first base.
3,not enough information,"I ordered the glove thinking that I was going to get the option of a left or right handed glove, but didn't. I had to return the glove and was then e-mailed saying that it was my fault and I had to pay shipping. I ordered another glove anyway, but I will probably think twice before ordering again."
2,not bad for some tlc wannabes,these girls are hypersexual a big turn on for me since I like menage a trois but my ex girlfriend had this tape back in the day and froggy style was her favorite was'nt for those good bedroom memories I'd pass this on by.
1,Disappointed,"Afro Celt Sound System's first album was outstanding: mesmerizing, soul-stirring, the soundtrack for life's greatest and most tragic loves. Rich and intelligent in rhythm and melody, it will be forever one of my most favorite albums. But the songs on this follow up album are repetitive and shallow, palty and boring by comparison. I hope its just that their creative juices needed a rest after blowing all out on Sound Magic; maybe the next one will be closer to their first. Seems to me all these rave reviews are looking at the Emperor's New Clothes. I'll stick to Volume 1, thanks..."
3,Afro Celt is one giant...Ehhh...,"First time I heard of Afro Celt, it sounded like a great concept. There were on CNN being interviewed at a World Music festival. They described themselves as African beats with Celtic melodies. I understand the African part. I understand the Celtic part. What's with all the techno?The first track is awesome. I'll give them that. After that it's a slow decent downhill. Perhaps they've gone more the way of the first track on other albums. I can hope.I'm not saying this album is bad. I'm just giving it a forewarning. And that is this. Before you buy this album, ask yourself, ""Do I like techno?"" And not just techno. Repeditive, club-like techno.Personally, I hope they get a little more melodic and less techno. However, lot's of people are loving them, and as a music fan I have to give them credit for that."
4,Give this one a listen.,"This album, far from a retread of their previous release, Volume 1: Sound Magic, has a new infusion of pop and techno styles. Release isn't nearly as startling different as its predecessor, but at the same time it has more staying power and should gain the Afro Celt Sound System an even broader audience than it had before."
5,"Brilliant blend, beautiful music","This highly implausible fusion of folk cultures that would seem to have nothing in common produces truly beautiful music that can be played again and again. The production also is impeccable, showing endless attention to detail and surprising complexity behind the seemingly simple melodies. Traditional Celtic folk instruments are used alongside computer-synthesized sounds, with African percussion (no conventional drum set that I can hear). Totally original, brilliant, refreshing, and addictive."
5,Excellent.,"The excitement and musicianship heard on this album is absolutely amazing. Having just seen the band last night, I can honestly say this CD captures the energy and the ""in the moment"" feel of the live show. Be prepared to move!"
5,Great CD!,"A great CD that really gets your feet tapping to the beat. Good drum rythms, bagpipes, et all. Lyrics don't get in the way of the music. A definite improvment over Vol 1."
4,Excellent! Also get Deep Forest & Stone Edge!,"This is a wonderfully constructed and well blended album! The mesh of African and Celtic music works perfectly on this cd and as a whole it's style reminded me the most of Deep Forest (the more African aspects) and Stone Edge (the more Celtic aspects). Favorite tracks include Elrean, Even in my dreams, and Amber. The style of this cd is definately ""ethno-beat"" or ""global-beat"" - it combines exotic vocals and instrumentations with modern rhythms and synthesizers. If you love this album your next purchases should be albums by Deep Forest or Stone Edge. I rank all of them very highley.Afro-Celt's ""Vol.2: Release"" is an absolute must have for fans of this genre of music!"
5,Pure exhilaration,"The first Afro-Celt album has been a favorite of mine for over two years now, but I wasn't sure if their second would live up to my expectations...the first seemed like a glorious fluke, it was so organic and natural. But it does, and not only that, it takes all the energy of the first several steps higher. Vol.2 is a brilliant album from beginning to end, with not a single dip in the intensity of emotion. This is one of those rare albums that made me dance one minute and cry the next [I dare anyone to keep a dry eye through 'Urban Aire]. And the cameos are terrific; Nigel Eaton's amazing hurdy-gurdy fits this group like a glove. I think this album stands up there with the great worldbeat/world-fusion albums, and betters most of them. I just wish they'd come to America."
3,I actually Enjoyed This,"Maybe it helped that I had been drinking when I watched this, but it had some funny bits.I liked the sketch about 'taking sex to the next level'. Thought the idea of the sex toy being jealous of the new girlfriend was funny. Ok, not all the sketches were hilarious, but they were for the most part entertaining. I've seen worse comedies.Les."
1,Garbage,"It looked funny but turned out to be lousy! A very disappointing film, the preview was actually the highlight of the entire movie!"
1,no chance,"Sure, ok, instead of crapping, pissing, spewing and spitting into a bucket for a week and then consuming its contents let's watch this movie.Actually, no. Let's not."
4,"It reminds you, you've been there",I loved this book. Julian Barnes guides the reader into another persons world while retaining the reality they recognise. This book concentrates on the way that jealously can ruin love. A bitter sweet story.
2,barnes makes it hard to care,"i'm told that his latest, england, england has the same problem. the characters that barnes creates are such irritating and hateful gits that you just don't give a damn whether they live or die. 'before she met me' is the mildly nauseating tale of a self-obsessed middle-aged loser who can't live with the fact that his wife had an existence (and one or two boyfriends) before marrying him. he goes slowly mad and that's pretty much it. don't waste your time with this, mercifully short and smartly written though it is."
1,i have read almost all of barnes,"and this is a vicious, silly, revolting book with anobsession over sexual jealousy that will make youreel. julian barnes has written three decentbooks: ""talking it over,"" ""love, etc."" and thesolid short story collection ""cross channel.""the rest are worthless--he's an effete francophile(horrors!) and a teabag milquetoast. William Boydis the only really formidable English novelist thesedays. sad. don't get this or anything by salman rushdie.Ouchy!"
2,Somewhat tedious,I saw where this book was going early on. It was good enough to keep me reading but disappointing to find the ending as expected. The main character was obsessed but I has a hard time believing anyone would actually behave as he did.
2,"reasonable story, bad writing","I like horror stories and started this with high hopes. There is an idea here, somewhere, but the writing is very bad. Partly it's as if: Now, I've got to do sex, now I've got to switch for suspense. Often, it's hard to know who is the current character."
5,The title says everything.,"If you're looking for a tutorial that will guide you to install FreeBSD and recompile the kernel, you're looking in the wrong place. If you're an experienced network administrator/user who wants to take advantage of that knowledge with FreeBSD, you'll feel in heaven.The book is an excellent guide to set up a complete and highly reliable network server/workstation (web, ftp, mail, firewall etc.) compatible with many other OS.There are few books that accomplish the promise they make with the title, but this is an example of a very focused work on the field the author wants to cover.It's a good thing to support the FreeBSD project, but it's better when you get what you want for your bucks. However, you can get the ""Handbook"", ""The Complete FreeBSD"" book or ""FreeBSD Unleashed"" for a broader knowledge of FreeBSD, and when you feel at home with the OS, then get this book to fine tune your network services."
5,A brilliant idea & a literary gem!,"Have you ever wanted to sit down with one of your favorite authors and gab about books? While most of us can't do this, fans of Henry Miller do have this innovative work as a substitute. In it, Miller lists his favorite authors & books, then expounds on various authors, subjects & points in his reading life. Blaise Cendrars, Jean Giono, Krishnamurti, reading while in the john & more get their own chapters. Miller wanted to write more editions, including a list of over 50,000 titles he has read, but never got the chance to do so. That's okay. I'm very grateful for having this work available!"
1,Don't buy this edition!!!,"The book is literally unreadable! (No pun intended). It was scanned from something(?) and then reprinted resulting in very many distracting mistakes. Any word starting with a capital letter followed by the letter 'i' is printed as 'Ufe'=Life, 'Hght'=Light,'Hes'=lies,etc. At least half of the printing of the word 'we' is printed as 'wc', 'acttially'=actually.I could go on...but my point is; Don't Buy This Book!"
5,Still great after all these years,"I had missed hearing and seeing David Meece in concert so I had to order this cd. It brings back the good times of when he was touring. I love the songs and they haven't gotten old. Still good, still timeless"
5,Delightful read!,"Pat Welsh has skillfully blended memoir and gardening advice, making for extremely interesting and helpful reading. I read it first in 1996 (when it first hit the book stores) and am now enjoying it for the second time."
5,"Diverse, appealing and stimulating.","Talk about eclectic and multi-faceted! This guy gets involved in so many different styles and does all of them justice. He has a unique ability to reflect lyrical disonance within his structure of music. Something that lets the listener take his journey into the mundane dimensia of everyday life. Not an easy task. Try walking in someone elses shoes. The music isn't just for listening...you can actually hear a cognitive process. Kind of felt like I was riding a neural cart over his synaptic rollercoaster. Great sounding CD. Some absoultely hilarious liner notes. The engineering on this CD is absoultely phenomenal. Really cool graphics. Too bad there's no picture of the CD on this site. Heavy King Crimson and Zappa influences. ""Hang-up your receiver when finished."" You'll get it when you listen to it."
3,Balanced treatment of copyrights and patents,"This is the best balanced treatment of copyrights and patents I have seen. Unsurprisingly, it is also not very original to people who have been following a lot of the discussion on-line. The author unfortunately brings a frequently annoying (and often stupid, see mention that Jar Jar Binks is ""blatantly racist"" on page 77 of the paperback for example) academic Leftism to the text. Includes a good treatment of peer to peer file sharing and an excellent discussion of culture as a ""living artifact"" (NOT the author's term). Also, since it is 4 years old, it misses out on some newer issues that the author would have addressed since they bear directly on his thesis, like the Sony rootkit fiasco a couple of years ago."
3,good yet unclear ideas,"The author brings up very interesting ideas, discussing how culture and technologies are inherently anarchistic, and how oligarchies are constantly trying to harness these for control & profit, which may end up damaging or destroying them in the process. The 'anything goes' trading of Napster wasn't good for artist and content produces, but the tied-down DRM world is even worse in the long run.He definitely knows his material, but the writing just isn't that clear. He compares things to ""Anarchistic Libertarianism"" like I'm supposed to instantly know the ramifications of the term. I'd read a paragrah and realize I have no idea what he was trying to say.There's a great argument to make here, I just don't think Siva Vaidhyanathan presents it very well."
5,Rolling Thunder,Beeing a former Green Beret 1967-1970... I enjoyed this movie..Staring William Devane and a young Tommy Lee Jones. What a great story of a just cause. Plenty of action and very accurate portrayal of weapons and the destructive power of a pump shotgun...Uncle Billy
4,Rolling Thunder: Diamond in the Sand,"I first saw this video in 1985. The movie caught my attention and held it throughout. Sure, there are other movies that attempt to deal with the plight of the vet, robberies and vengeance, love of family and vendetta. But there is not a movie out there that combines all of these with the same rhythm and intensity as ""Rolling Thunder."" At a time when movies are relying more on computer generated graphics than on a plot with substance, Rolling Thunder should be being aired on TNT, TBS, Lifetime, TNN and any other cable channel that wants to break away from the monotonous hum-drum of the fare being shown in the name of ""entertainment."" Devane does more than one good hand and a hook than most of today's action heroes do with both hands and both feet. Rah also for my main man, Tommy Lee Jones, who takes a back seat to Devane, but stands by his buddy to the end as they seek out the baddies that done Devane's family wrong. A must see!"
2,"Great Movie, Mediocre DVD","Warner Bros. does a good job with their on demand DVDs and I was hoping for the same level of quality from MGM. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the ""Rolling Thunder"" disc. MGM did a sloppy job when they prepared this movie for DVD. This is most apparent in the interior (low light) scenes when flickering horizontal lines follow the actors as they move. This is distracting and certainly not what you would expect from a home video released by a major studio. Also, the DVD cover art looks like it was Xeroxed at Kinko's. I hope that someday Criterion or Blue Underground will give this movie a proper DVD/Blu-ray release.Bottom line: ""Rolling Thunder"" is a great movie, but this DVD is not worth $17.99."
3,It's a gritty and bloody revenge movie but a bit dated.,There are plenty of other better and more recent revenge movies out there but this is still a good one to watch if you've seen all the others.
5,Gotta Love It!,"Missler and Eastman have done an outstanding job. The reviews, as you will notice, are either extremely positive or they want their money back. The subject area itself causes such divergent views. These gentlemen have done an excellent work, one that might be the only way to get though to your new age friends and relations. (Incidently, there is one recent ""review"" below from a man who has made a career of attacking Mr. Missler. Hope he someday seeks gainful employment.)"
4,Interesting Viewpoint,"This book illustrates just how the UFO phenomenon is linked to Demonology and the Occult. Well argumented and a good approach.Also highly recommended: ""Alien Intervention: The Spiritual Mission of UFOs"" by Paul Christopher"
5,Good Book.,When most people see a light in the sky or a UFO they automatically think of life on other planets. How can you jump ahead so fast?Fallen Angels ..Satan using supernatural powers to deceive us in the last days.Get ready for a huge deception. Run for the Hills.
4,This book was about the Anatomy of Science Fiction.,"The book was a time killer, the vocabulay was at a high levle and the author had put a lot of sence into it. The book was a great sucess and you should read it too. The book talkled about genre and other aliens. Space travle and space aliens. The authors that have written many science ficition books have created a enviorment in which you can explore the deep space. I liked and disliked this book. I liked this book because it had a meaning of science fiction and the author had a great finish. The disliking parts were the- high tone of vocabulary and the usage of it. The other reason is that the author had a bad start, telling about other books and their authors. Well if yiu are a great reader I would read this book. But my standerds on vocabulary are simple. Grown ups should read this book along with elders. Try it out you could learn something............"
1,Before you swallow Missler's claims...,"I read this book a couple of years ago after hearing Missler speak at a local Calvary Chapel. I bought the book because I have always had a small interest in UFO's and Missler's presentation was somewhat interesting. Yet during the presentation he casually accused the Reformers of the 16th century of not going far enough in their theology and ""discovering"" dispensationalism. He also made bizarre claims of the Niphilim which no theologian has EVER made in the history of the church.After you buy this book, purchase Richard Abanes' book, END-TIME VISIONS. Abanes exposes Missler's use of white-supremacist literature and Missler's inflated claims about his (Missler's) credentials."
1,Worst sort of subterfuge for religious promotion,"This book is not intended as an objective discussion on alien encounters. It is deceptively portrayed as such, but it is merely an attempt to convert or persuade readers towards believing in some sort of fundementalist cult mentality. It does great harm to the scientific investigation of UFOs when such publications attempt to ride on its popularity for religious fanaticism or other ulterior motives. This book was discarded rather than given away due to its spurious intentions."
2,A non christian point of view.,"The authors really had me going for a while. They lured me in and then put the clamps down on me. I thought the book in all was very well written but from a point of view that there is no such thing as a god, I would have to say they are trying to ""recruit"" you into the christian way of thinking. If the book wouldn't of been so one sided in the last 3-4 chapters then I may have stomached it better, but....all I can say is, if your into the bible then go ahead and get it."
1,Why can't I give this zero stars?,"Oh brother. This is the same stuff I had to listen to for endless hours growing up a fundamentalist christian. More of the hysterical ""aliens are demons"" nonesense. Does anyone even remember how to think critically anymore?I don't have time for a full fledged review just now, but suffice to say 1.) Save your money and 2.) if you do buy this book, please please don't stop your research and self-education on this (or any other) subject. Remember, ""a conclusion is what you come to when you don't want to think anymore."" If that's what you're searching for - an easy pseudo-intellectual, pseudo-spiritual out - then by all means, go for this book. If not, keep looking....(PS No, I am not a hard core UFO believing, alien loving, new age fanatic. I am a rational, pragmatic, and deeply spiritual skeptique...)"
5,Aliens the mystery revealed,"The book Alien encounters is the best book written on our current status in the religious and secular on the so called visitors form outer space.I have read other authors that touch on this subject and do a fairly good job but this book is the best covering even the history of aliens and the biblical perspective. We as Christian believers can know and not be deceived when this begins to unfold. I have been a fan of the stargate series and can see how the deception can easily be set up. Even the stories of the Ori (on Stargate SG1)reveal how they will be planning the deception. Great book, I would recommend it to everyone that wants to know what the great deception is as stated in scripture as we near the end of the age. Barbara in Woodstock GA"
2,Deceptively Informative,"As I started reading this, I thought it was a pretty good recap of the more well-known UFO cases out there. In fact, the first 100 pages or so lead the reader on quite well. What do I mean by this? I was expecting impartial journalism here, but this book is a decidedly Christian oriented book. Heaven forbid we are talking about genuine aliens from other planets. While I stopped reading this book abruptly about 30% through, I sensed that it was leading the readers to the notion that UFO's are demonic. While I understand this is a valid theory, I wish that the I had known ahead of time what direction this book was going to take. I would never have purchased it. This might be a good book to have in your library of UFO books, but it's not one that I will be referring to very often, as I just do not buy the demonic theory to explain this very complicated phenomenon."
1,Demonology takes Alien Form,"The book starts with the usual information about sightings and alien abductions, much of which is available on the web. The author then starts to make connections between the sightings and biblical stories and postulates that ""fallen angles"" are actually aliens. He draws heavily on the writings of Sitchin and Whitley Strieber to bolster his argument, and the Bible, of course, which is the main source of his argument. He takes the entire analogy too far, citing Revelations and trying to make it fit into his argument. The conclusion is that aliens are coming soon, they are not nice, and they will destroy us, so accept Jesus as your savior before it's too late. I was disappointed to have wasted my money on this book."
2,A slick fundamentalist bait-and-switch job.,"As a serious researcher on the psychology of belief systems, I was very disappointed at the deceptiveness of the authors' approach. While they seemingly did a great deal of research, it was selected mainly for its usefulness in their plan to engender fear in order to promote conversions. They even repeatedly stated that the material should make the reader fearful. Please, gentlemen, if you yourselves are so fearful, spare us your hysteria.Material which could well deserve careful and sensitive analysis was instead treated with the utmost credulity, a criticism that has also been leveled at Missler's treatment of the Apocalypse and even the Y2K computer problem (the so-called Millenium bug)."
1,Poor Photo quality,"I don't know how these got produced yet it seems like there are a lot of flaws in the schools of iridology. The flashcards are blurry and unclear making it more than a challenge to learn the details these cards claim to be showing. Avoid these, research quality materials you are confident in the visuals and explainations and buy that."
4,comfortable feeling,"I feel very comfortable to wear this, even over 5 hours, it's still OK for me. The sound is good for this price; however, sometimes it has background noise even when I turn off the music."
2,"Great sound, but cheaply made.","The sound is perfect, but there are two big BUTs:- Everyone near you will hear what you're watching/listening. No acustic isolation at all.- First time I travelled with them, they BROKE. Now I can't hear anything anymore from the right side. And now I have to buy another pair of headphones."
4,Great sound.... but...,"I loved these headphones. I bought the Radio Shack version since I was working there at the time and got them at a 30% discount... Same headphones, just had the word ""Titanium"" on the earphone.They lasted about a year worth of relatively tough use.The strap that actually makes them sit on the top of your head broke within a few months. They're only held onto the frame by flimsy thin little rubber cords. Be careful.My biggest problem, and the reason I just threw them away, is because of the Y-connection of each ear to the central cord. The central cord, at the bottom of the Y connection, came loose, and they never sounded the same again. I tried taping it back together to get a more consistent sound, but to no avail. However, I might buy them again. They definitely have superior sound to the Koss UR20s I just purchased.Good phones. Just handle gently if you want any real life out of them."
4,Want to plug into your computer to game for hours?,"The lightweight and good bass makes these a good pick for computer gaming IMHO; but if you have a noisy machine beware - the open design lets all outside sound through. For me that's a plus - I talk to my roommate when we game together, and at LAN parties it can be good to hear the chatter. I replaced a Sony headset with these and now I have no comfort problems if I stay jacked in for hours. You can spend over twice as much for some nice Bose Triports and get both the lighweight comfort and great sound; but come on - games don't exactly require audiophile quality drivers."
4,Ramarkably satisfactory,"These are suprisingly comfortable for full size headphones. The sound is nice, especially considering the price. My only issue is that they don't block out enough external noise for my liking. Besides that, they are an amazing deal."
2,Disappointing,Returned product since it did not keep out external sound as much as I was lead to believe by the item description.
2,"love the headphone, hate they're not loud enough","this headphone is great except for 2 things: (1) the cord is too thin and easy to dislodge from the unit; (2) the unit itself is not loud enough, of course this is just my opinion, but that's what you asked for."
2,Good but not travel friendly,"The sound is great.The wear is comfortable.But, this is not ideal for traveling."
3,Not good as expected,"1. Good for listening to pop music2. Bass is a little overemphasized3. Isolation is bad, actually."
4,Wow!,"These are great.They fit so well, and have great sound (that is, if you do the angled drivers mod, and give them time to break in with pink noise). Totally worth the cash.The UR40s have the same drivers as the KSC75s, which are also great headphones and respected by audiophiles everywhere.They get 4 stars because they feel really fragile, but you'll definitely have no problem with these because of the lifetime warranty.Though, these ARE NOT CLOSED CANS.I repeat, THESE ARE NOT CLOSED CANS.They are open and leak quite a bit of sound. Not recommended for airplane use.If you want cheap full-sized headphones for casual use, these are great!"
2,I wouldn't recommend,"I bought these one year ago. The prise was OK, the sound quality and the bass is OK. Especially for music like jazz, piano, electronic music. That are all advantages of it.They don't feel comfortable for your ears. After one hour, my ears are aching from headphone pressure. And it looks, like they don't breathe. My ears are also so hot, therefore very uncomfortable.The wire is too short and feels very fragile. After two days of using, inner ""leather"" lining teared off from inside.They are noise canceling, but in reality, usually other people can clearly hear what I'm listening to."
2,One earpiece faulty,The right earpiece sounded like a torn speaker cone on the Bass notes. I checked the music with another set of headphones and the Koss UR40 was definitely bad. I had to send it back under warranty. Cost me postage but they did waive the $6 handling charge since it was brand new.Waiting for the replacementBased on this experience I'm not sure I'd get these again
2,Perfectly fine unless you're on the outside,For me these were the worst headphones because the sound bleeds right out! I would have never known if my roommate didn't mention it to me but seriously it was like they were speakers instead of headphones that's how much sound was bleeding. This was a major downer for me since the point of having them in the first place was so not to bug others while still being able to blast my music.
3,Fine headphones for price but mesh fell off within a year,"I've had these about a year and a half now, but the fabric mesh that keeps the headphones off of your head (and helps prevent your hair from getting caught in the folding part of the headphones) fell off within a year. It's held onto the headphones with four small elastic bands that, as elastic tends to do, deteriorated. I rarely used these, so the wear/tear was minimal.For the price, not too bad. As other reviewers have said, the over-the-ear doesn't factor into much in terms of sealing out distracting noise, but they are more comfortable than other headphones I had that put too much pressure on my ears. Sound quality is fine. Nothing great, nothing horrid. Get what you pay for type of headphones."
1,beware this seller,"Amazon has made an error by working with Ritz. Ritz has not shipped the item for over a week, and only states that there is a ""warehouse problem"". Product may be good, but the seller performance is poor."
4,Most comfortable headphones ever...but don't last long,"Simply put, these are by far the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. Ultra-light and fits perfectly over my ears. I honestly forget that I'm wearing them sometimes, leaving them on even after my playlist has stopped.Good sound, good price...just one catch. Like at least one user mentioned, It starts to come apart after a year or so -- although I'm still using mine now. For me it was the cord near the plug-in jack. If you take extra good care of them though, I feel like they would last longer.To sum up, they came apart after a year -- and yet I'm *still* planning on buying the very same brand again. They're just that comfy, reasonably-priced, and offer pretty high quality sound."
4,A little expensive but overall very nice headphones.,The only problem I have with the headphones is the cord is to short. There is very little sound escaping out and almost no sound gets in contrary to other reviews. I would absolutley wear these in a library or even while taking an exam. Overall I'm very happy with them.
3,this is a great set of headphones,"this is my second pair of these headphones. my teenage son accidentally broke the first set. i liked them so much that i wanted the exact same set. they have great sound quality, but if you are buying them for a quiet place don't bother. they are easily heard by anyone who is in the same room, esp. at higher volumes."
3,Koss Cans,"These headphones are for gaming and bass heavy music, if you are looking for accurate sound reproduction then slap yourself on the hand and look elsewhere.It seems that the corners cut were in construction, this thing is plastic in key areas that I can see breaking in a few years, but can probably be fixed with super glue. Have I scared you yet? No? Ok, go get some. While you are at the store get a headphone extension cord as well, you are going to need it.I compared these to the AKG 271's I have at work...I should never have done that. For $40 it's pretty good, but if I buy any more ""under $100"" headphones I'll get the Grado SR80's and give these away. What a mistake. If you have never heard what -real- headphones can do then this is probably as good a choice as any."
2,Ouch!,"The cushion on the cups squishes down so much that the center (speaker area) is in contact with, and presses painfully on, the bones of the ear (as per Rosella Streett's review). I couldn't wear these for 30 minutes without major discomfort. Amazon's return policy is great. Will try the Sony MDR-V6 instead."
2,these are crap!!!,the whole point of over the ear headphones is so that others around you are not bothered by what you're listening to....you can hear the music loud and clear if you're sitting anywhere near the person using theseI lost the reciept or I would have returned them by now.....JUNK!!! the only thing they're good for is mowing the lawn...I HOPE
1,Not Happy,These were an impulse purchase with a gift card at Borders. They were $39.95 but I had a 40% off coupon and they are still going back. Muddy sound that is hardly better than the Sony Walkman earphones I was using.Expected more from Koss!!
2,Too much to paid for ordinary headphones,"This Headphones are quit good looking,but thats all what they have.No spectacular sound and the cord it's too shortthey don't have the extra Bass feature as the manufactures said.They are overpriced()They should cos't about... dollars for the final costumer."
1,Wouldnt reccomend,"these headphones have extreme bass, more than i would want. Even when i turn the bass all the way down on whatever i have them plugged into they still overpower the rest of the music. That and they broke within a week of getting them. waste of 30 bucks"
3,"Okay sound, but....","These headphones are not bad sounding for the price, but they have one fatal flaw: Anyone sitting in a ten foot radius can hear your music just as well as you can. Even at low volumes, these headphones are audible to anyone in the proximity."
1,Scoliosis : Correction Without Braces or Surgery,"I didn't buy the book because of the previous review. And once again I said ""Thank you, Amazon.com for providing us with this opportunity to share information"""
3,Too much Paper Jams,"This printer is fine for printing the letter size pages. For 4' X 6"" photos this printer is very troublesome. Too much paper jams occur. My printer is now spoiled as photo paper got stuck too many times. Ink is relatively expensive and stay away from this printer if you want to print photos."
3,"Good for price, but you get what you pay for","When you look at the cost/performance ratio, this battery is a great deal, but if you are a professional you want the best battery life possible, so you would probably have to get between 2 or 3 of these to be equivalent to the real Canon battery.It's cheap, you get what you pay for but it would probably be worth it for cheap emergency backup batteries for your equipment. It's no where near as good as the canon battery. I bought this battery as a spare when I bought my canon 20d nearly 3 years ago and the canon battery still holds a charge like new (can easily take 600-1000 pictures on one charge) while this battery even when new could only take maybe 300-400 pictures at best.I probably sound harsh but the capacity isn't as good as the actual Canon one."
5,Great product!,"This is just like the original battery, lasts about the same too. Not sure why but sometimes camera won't turn on right away after putting it after charging. Power cycling camera usually fixes issue. This is a minor problem, only annoying when I need to take a picture right away. Good bargain, recommended to anyone."
1,Lasted 1 hour on the first cycle and now 2 minutes!,This battery is no better than staying plugged into the wall. Perhaps I got a defective one. Highly recommend going through a couple of cycles before the return period is over.
5,Nice fork!,We use it as our cat food fork and it works well. Bought a spare in case we lose the first one but it is a really nice fork - good buy!
2,"Nusrat is the Best, but this album isn't very good","Sadly this recording is the final performance of my beloved Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan - a man whose voice and passion made me believe in the purity and power of life.The CD isn't as bad as the review indicates, but it certainly isn't the best of Nusrat available. Shabazz, Mustt Mustt, Night Song, any of these albums offer a better picture of his music. I do agree with the review in that these arraingements of his songs don't seem as ""his"" as others do. They are radical departures from his signature style and don't really allow the listener to experience his voice as is; including too much out-of-context accompaniment (a saxophone? please, never again...) and generally being overproduced, robbing the songs of one of their best qualities - always having the emotion of being spontaneous.I love Nusrat and his music, but I recommend skipping this recording in favor of almost any other."
4,Remove the imperialistic review by Amazon.com,"The Amazon.com review smacks of obscene colonial attitutes.Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was a ""popular"" musician not some exoticized musician playing for ""mystical sufi"" muslims.This music reflects a celebration in modern day pakistan, where european influences exist.Why isn't there a review of Rick Martin lamenting the loss of ""pure"" music."
1,Dullsville,"I was drawn to pick up this book because of good reviews and what appeared to be an interesting setting. It was dull beyond belief. The characters were vapid, boring and predictable. The plot was also dull and uninteresting. The only thing that was done with some level of creativity was the descriptions of the fashions. Other than that, forgetable.Linda C. WrightAuthor, One Clown ShortOne Clown Short"
2,"All Dressed Up, Going Nowhere","I read a ""Daily Candy"" endorsement for this novel and was eager to see why it was one of only three books recommended as great summer reading. I found the characters to be shallow and completely unbelievable and the story to be ill-contrived. The facet of the book that did ring true was the handling of the four nephews. I would definitely not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Don't bother with this book,My neigborhood book club read this book for our last meeting. Not one person out of 10 liked the book. Don't bother reading it. It's boring and poorly written.
5,A Must Read for Summer 2006!!,"This debut novel by Elizabeth Oberbeck is wonderful! Elizabeth Oberbeck's lyrical and descriptive writing takes you to France and the world of haute couture, while also enchanting you with the chemistry between the dressmaker and his muse. This beautiful book is a must read for Summer 2006."
3,Obssession Lives,"While I did enjoy the book, I didn't give it a higher rating because I found Claude, the main character, too whimpish. He seemed to allow himself to be pushed around by everyone. It's like he had no backbone. I did like, however, the love he had for his nephews; very endearing. I enjoyed the book, but wasn't completely wowed. I found the continuous description of every outfit Claude saw a little too tiring. Otherwise, it wasn't a bad read."
2,Too Effusive!,"Reading the Dressmaker is like eating nothing but cookies for dinner and following it with orange soda: too sweet and no substance. I find myself laughing almost every chapter at Oberbeck's overly effusive style. Recognizably a first attempt at writing novels. However, I will probably finish the book! It's a decent book for a light, fluffy summer afternoon. If you can handle novels like the Notebook, you might like this."
1,Disjointed tale of a tailor turned stalker,"My hope for a good read quickly disappeared in the first chapter of this book. The Dressmaker follows a 'country' tailor's rise to couture fame while he finds and stalks his muse. The author provides very vivid and enjoyable descriptions of the fashion world, including the inner workings of a famous designer house in France. The rest of the story introduces characters in a rapid fire way, with seldom any character development, aside from the tailor Claude and his Muse, Valentine. The story jumps around from the small French village outside of Paris, to Paris itself and New York. Family, friends and Claude's 'forgotten' wife come in and out of the story line, only providing irrelevant detail and minimal character development to the main story.I love anything and everything dealing with France and fashion. This book is the exception. I found it to be laborious reading with an ending that was as just as disappointing as the first chapter."
4,My Thoughts After Caroline,"When I finished After Caroline, I felt like I was saying goodbye to old friends. Kay Hooper kept me on an emotional rollercoaster with the heroine, Joanna Flynn, from the first page to the last. Several times during the book, I felt an almost erie sense of being right there with the characters. Since reading After Caroline, I have gone on to read Ms. Hooper's novel Amanda, and I enjoyed it just as much. I plan to read more of Ms. Hooper's books soon."
4,Liked the Story,"I liked the story. There was enough mystery to keep me fairly interested, but the characters seemed a little flat. It seems either authors do a great job of either character development or story development. In this case, it is story development."
4,Engrossing mystery/romance,Well crafted novel with an interesting plot and good characterization of the principals. Just enough sex to be interesting without overshadowing the story line.
5,A good dopelganger tale with mystery and romantic suspense stirred in. Very suspenseful.,Kay Hooper is one of my favorite authors. A nice blend of suspense and mystery.She balances suspense and intrigue very well.
4,A great read.,"I have only read a few things by her, they were not to bad, but this had me hooked in the first 3 pages. I read it every chance I got on my Kindle and found it hard to put it down. It moved fast, made me feel like I was there and didn't figure out the ending til the very end like alot of other books I have read. Hate that. I will surely order more by her, especially if they are written like this."
3,"A good read, but hardly a faithful translation...","Nicole Riggs has presented a very well written book, but comparing her translation to the Tibetan original, I can't help but notice that she often omits sizable chunks of the texts. But what really has me bewildered is the strange gender issue that she seems to have. When I translate a text, I translate what's written there, period. I do not add things, unless I make it very clear that it is an addition by me, and I certainly don't change things around so they suit me better. But changing even the names of male deities into female ones, now that's utterly ridiculous!!! But as I say, otherwise a good and inspiring read...Thomas Roth, one of Ven. Tenga Rinpoche's interpreters, Kathmandu"
2,very average,"i think Jonathan Butler has talent but this set doesn't reflect much.I dug Sarah,Sarah&Lies but overall it's Brunch Light."
5,Nite Music,"During those rare quiet nights in the ER, there's nothing quite like Dancing Fantasy's ""Take Five"" to soothe the weary. The opening note will take your breath away! This song, and subsequently, the album, was my intro to smooth jazz. Enjoy."
4,Not Zappulla but Mandelbaum,"This book is not what is advertised. The translation is not Zappulla's (which is too bad because he did a wonderful job) but rather Allen Mandelbaum (who's translation is also excellent.) I would recommend this book but it's unfortunate that Amazon has mis-identified this edition. I would very much like to have the Zappulla translation as well as the Hollander translation.For students of Dante, this version is an excellent place to start but it would be nice to also see Musa, Hollander and Zappulla in the Kindle Store."
5,The best verse translation of Dante in our time,"Unlike the Hollanders' version of the Divine Comedy, Mandelbaum actually provides a flowing verse translation that conveys the richness of Dante's masterpiece in both its music and language. What, then, have the Hollanders done? They've taken the Singleton prose translation and shoehorned it into a metrical framework - but it still reads like a plodding prose translation, broken up into stanzas. I think Mandelbaum's effort deserves to be turned into a deluxe limited edition. Other than the Mandelbaum translation of the complete Comedy, do try the W.S. Merwin translation of Purgatory (he didn't do Inferno or Paradiso), another superb verse translation. Both bring the full scope of Dante's achievement within reach of the English reader as never before."
2,Disappointment,The story sounded interesting but because this was a poem or play that was a interpretation the book was hard reading and difficult to follow. Would have been better if the author didn't have such a literal interpretation.
3,Hard read,The left page is in latin and the right is in english...and I still only read about 20 pages. It's just not how we write today and it's just hard to keep my focus trying to get through this book. Having said that I know it's an important piece of literature. Maybe they'll make it a movie someday.
2,Problem with pagination in Kindle Edition of Inferno by Mandelbaum,"First, let me say that the print edition of this work is excellent, with the Italian text and English translation by Mandelbaum on facing pages, plus the illustrations by Moser. I have the hardback edition of all three volumes.The problem with the Kindle edition is that they did not manage to keep the pagination correct. Though a Kindle book does not have facing pages, we could at least expect one page with Italian text, and the next page with the corresponding English translation, etc. Note that I checked this with the Kindle sample on the Kindle iPad app, but I presume this would also be true on actual Kindle devices.Since this was not done, I can not recommend this edition."
4,Dante is the king of hellfire....,"This is an excellent translation of a classic, complete with illustrations.By now you should know about the contents so I will simply say that this is the best version."
2,Not worth to make a DVD out of it,"I would not say it the way others do in reviews, an orchestra that is not from german speaking soil can shure play Bruckner as good as a Berlin Philarmonic. The problem with this orchestra from Israel is that it simply is not a top level orchestra. When I hear the many missed tones from the brass section (the wagner tubas even miss the tones in the first measures) and the bad pitch of the strings, I would say for an amateur-village-orchestra they play pretty good. The conductor swings his lower jaw around it seems he could loose it any moment. His conducting is very theatralic, I dont understand much about conducting but he does not make a good impression."
3,"Not this one, buy the Herbert Von Karajan instead !","This is NOT nearly as good a perfomance as the SONY DVD withHerbert Von Karajan conducting the Weiner Philhrmonic. Zuben Mehta must have been sick that day, and coughes as crutial moments. The Israel Philharmonic plays timidly, when majestic playing is required: THEY SEEM LIKE THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING ! The Wiener Philharmonic is TRUELY better able to handle Brucker, and Karajan IS the ""papa"" of recording this kind of music."
1,Un-ideomatic,"Not for the purist. Mehta and the Israelis struggle through this monumental symphony.Clearly not comfortable with this metaphysically complex music. Mehta is best at accompanying singers in light hearted fare. If you are looking for a Bruckner 8th on DVD, you may have to wait till Sony releasers the epic and masterful realization by Celibidache and the Munich Philharmonic."
4,Works OK,"This products works well as a stand for the my SP-660, but you must be in the sitting psition to use it. If its height was adjustable it would be the perfect compliment to the steam press."
3,TOO SHORT,"THIS IS A GOOD ITEM BUT ITS WAY TO SHORT,IT SHOULD BE AT LEAST 8 INCHES HIGHER,YOU HAVE TO SIT DOWN TO USE IT.POOR DESIGN.MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT LESS THEN 5 FOOT TALL."
3,Bit flimsy,Holds the press like it states it should. Seems overpriced and regret buying it. The press would work equally well on a table or counter.
2,Too Short,"I wished I had read the reviews for this product before purchasing it. The stand works great for the press, but is too short if you want to stand. My husband built a wood box for the stand to sit on and now it is the perfect height. I do not understand why the stand cannot be adjusted. I rated this product low because of the height issue, otherwise good product."
1,Poor design - very disappointing,"My stand broke not long after purchasing it, at the spot where the diagonal brace joins the side shelf. I could only duct tape it. Even though I was not hard on the equipment, the table head (where the Steamer sits) was wobbly and flexed a lot every time I would lower the iron onto the clothes.If you purchase this, you will tell in an instant by looking at it that it is cheaply made, and not engineered to do the work asked of it... at least not for very long. I am 5'6"", and also found it much too short for a long-term ironing binge. You'll have to bend over, sitting and steam pressing just do not go well.I threw mine away and just sit my press on the kitchen table. If I had it all to do over, knowing the facts, I truly never would have ordered it. Still, if you only press a shirt now and then, it might be worth ordering."
3,Good fit for Steamfast but too low,"I think the Steam-Press stand is a great fit for the SteamFast A600 but one major drawback - too low to ground. About another foot higher and it would be a great product. Mind you also that I'm well under 6 feet tall.....so, need I say more?"
1,Steam-Press Stand,"I purchased this item for Xmas,I didn't know that this stand was so small that only my eight year old could only use it. This stand only reaches my knee, you have to sit down to use this product. Save your money and back.SteamFast A600-016 EZ Steam-Press Stand for Steam-Press Models SP-660, SF-661, and SF-680"
4,returned but satisfied,THe SteamFast A600-016 EZ Steam-Press Stand for Steam-Press Models worked well with the item. We returned it because we returned the Steam-Press Model that it was used for. No problems with this item.
1,Don't buy this stand.,"Hurray! My steam press is here. I've never been so happy to do some ironing. Gee, I hope this works... and saves me some time. (assemble everything) Why the hell is the stand three feet off the ground? That defeats the purpose of having a stand. This is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen. I could have saved myself the back ache and the fifty bucks by just positioning the press on something in my laundry room. Maybe I'm wrong but I think every free-standing ironing board in the history of all ironing boards was designed to be height adjustable. You would think that would come to mind when whoever was designing this press stand. But it didn't. Buy the steam press. It's great. Don't buy the stand. It's stupidly short. In fact, I think the design of this stand was intended to be a joke on people. Place the steam press on a table or something."
3,Ironing on the next level!,"It took me ten years to finally purchase a pressing machine for the home and another month to open the box and realize that I would need the stand that Amazon suggested that I purchase with the unit. The setup has freed up some of the money I used to spend on dry cleaning AND given me a new appreciation of fabrics, influencing my purchases from a ""care and maintenance"" perspective. The stand is low, but I'm flexible enough to do a weeks worth of ironing on my knees, giving thanks while I'm down there. Others have mentioned that they employ the use of a chair and I'm sure there are other alternatives, but the stand works for me!"
2,"to cheap, thin, feel like it will broke easy.","i need a stand to hold the presser, but the stand is kind of thin,i dont know how long it will last."
1,"Do not like this item at all, too short","This item is short and non adjustable. In fact, it holds the press with velecro strap.. Do not purchased. Look for one the has adjustable heights."
4,steam press stand,"Convenient for using the Iron if you want to sit and Iron, the garment rack is useless, to low to hang anything on and just gets in the way when you have to store the iron and rack. I just took it off and don't use it."
3,Broken Ledge rod pin,I used the stand and it works fine. The only complaint that I have is that the plastic part that holds the ledge rod into place came broken and i cannot use the ledge as intended. If Amazon has a solution on how to replace the small part please let me know.
5,Everyone should read this book!,"Finally, someone has put into print an accurate and factual picture of what the drug manufacturing industry does to place profits way ahead of patient benefit and safety. Anyone who takes prescription medications should read this book. Maybe it gets a little too technical in spots for people not in the health professions, but there is plenty of excellent information and suggestions to make this a very valuable reference for consumer-oriented patients.I am a doctoral-level clinical pharmacist, and I found myself in agreement with most all of what Dr. Cohen has written and recommended in this book. This should be required reading for every practicing physician, medical student, pharmacist, and nurse in the country. Medical schools should add this to their curriculum for all of our doctors-to-be to read before they take their pharmacology course and start their clinical training."
5,a true diva,I was introduced to Ms. Bofill's music with this CD and I must admit it was love at first listen. The songs travel through the different stages of love with such eloquence that it's almost unreal. The title track is simply gorgeous. This is a must buy.
3,Not as expected,"Don't get me wrong, I love her music, but this is not the usual angela bofill I am used to. I guess,her singing style is much different than other cd's. I still think it's good, but not great."
1,Terrible.,"It's not so much Angela's voice, which is still good, but definitely not as great as it was during her '78 to '85 heyday, but rather the awful, synthesized production and weak material. A definite turkey. Stick to one of the ""best of"" CDs."
1,Not good,"This book was a waste of my money. I admit I ordered this book haphazardly before reading into the author and the reviews available online, however, it would be best to warn other customers from buying this book. For starters, this book is a masquerade of scholarship. It is riddled with facts that are simply wrong and conclusions that strech across the grand canyon. A perfect alternative to understanding the Traditional School of Thought from also a historical perspective that is more objective and respectable, one should look into Harry Oldmeadow's Traditionalism: Religion in the Light of the Perennial Philosophy."
1,Againt any true spirituality,"Mark Sedgwick's Against the Modern World , more a detective story than an academic work actually, can hardly be considered as a reliable source on the Perennialist/Traditionalist school. Its intellectual shortcomings and even factual errors prove a contrario that no study of the Perennialist school can be seriously pursued without first-hand knowledge of the Perennialist writings and a sufficient background on the traditions and authorities to whom the Perennialists refer."
2,A Poorly Written Introduction to an Interesting Social Movement,"Traditionalism is an interesting idea. Basically it's a combination of the sort of standard new age idea that all the worlds religions share a single basic kernel of truth coupled with a deep hatred for the corruption of the modern capitalistic world and a distrust for the average person. It has been closely allied with both the new age movement, and fascism at different points. Add in a bunch of masons and western Sufis, and its an interesting and unique movement. It deserved a better book that this one.Mr. Sedgwick, frankly, is not a strong writer. Every character and idea he introduces is labeled ""pivital"" and ""key"". And the narrative history of the movement is often hard to follow. This just goes to show that if you pick an interesting and controversial subject matter, you can get your book published, even if it isn't very good."
5,A Journey to Madagascar,"I spent the last few days of 2010 reading ""The Invisible Vazimba"" and traveling ""a satellite's twirl away"" to an invisible island in the middle of a lake, an ""undisturbed umbilicus lost in the belly of Eden."" What verdant imagery! What a fun and fantastic action adventure, teeming with sensuality, goddess power, and stunning natural beauty! The novel blooms like an exotic orchid, and what fun it was to swim with the crocodiles alongside woman warrior Eva and her Vazimba queen pal Rangita. Aside from being a rip-roaring adventure tale, the novel helped me recall Siddhartha and the part about trusting in the river of life... it was a gift of the heart."
2,Blu Ray,"You know what the problem is? That after watching HBO's Rome series nothing comes even close. I thought Id go for this when the price was right at about $11.99. BTW thats about the top price for it imho. True its a 2 disc version and Region free (am in Australia). At least I managed to sit through it all, was amazed how graphic the sex scenes were considering when it was made. Quite pornographic which I find well at least theyre telling it like it was, plenty debauchary. McDowell was over the top. Im not to familiar with the true history of Caligula, but this cant be a close rendition. Alot of poetic license in use. Not much in sets used could almost have been a stage production. Either way the blu ray transfer was bearable, Id say 80's DVD quality perhaps. I didnt bother checking out disc 2 yet. But this isnt a keeper once watched so will be offloading it in the not to distant future.Hope this may help you in your decision, if so please vote on it."
1,Poor definition,One would expect better detail in the images but is naturally disappointed. So get a DVD instead. This is a waste of money.
3,"Get it for the porn, not the history","Absolutely great hardcore porn scenes with gratuitious history thrown in for... why? Not sure. Seemed like it should have been one or the other, but this movie tries to be both."
4,Caligula,Great Movie! It is a shocker! It really makes you think about politics and the people with power.
1,The worst part of this movie is that it is sooooo boring,"The worst crime of this movie is not all the depravation, waste of money or the fact that it is a porn film; the worst part is that it is soooo boring. I found time to fold my laundry, clear my e-mail and read the reviews on this movie. There are some good scenes here and there, some emotional as well (when Drusilla dies)...everything else is blah. What a waste of money this was. It fails as a porn film, as a historical film and as a film."
1,TOO MANY ORGIES,"Bet you thought you'd never hear me say that!Most troublesome aspect of the sex scenes is that they were edited in the same choppy style that MTV uses--except this movie was made before MTV even existed.Story concerns Caligula's rise to power, his search for a wife, his cruelty, his growing insanity, and his richly deserved end.Yes, there are many beautiful, all-natural girls in this movie, but as I said, they're filmed so erratically that you never get a feel for their overall appearance.However, Teresa Ann Savoy, who plays Drusilla, is the most beautiful of all, and her scenes are richly filmed.Final word, though--save your money."
3,quality,"Okay, I have not seen this movie, but as I sat here reading these reviews, I see how much people are complaining about the quality of the DVD...get used to it...older movies that have not been carefully archived are going to look bad. I have for the last year and a half been doing digital transfers and you can only work with the quality you are given. If the original is bad, than the subsequent copies will be the same."
1,"Porn, totally disappointing!",Was totally discusted by movie. Will be very cautious about downloading any other other movies that may be pornographic. Not my type! Did not watch entire movie. Could find no merit in producing such porn.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"The only saving grace for this film is its cinematic history. Despite cameo appearances by various well-known actors, it is poorly edited, poorly acted, and isn't much more than over-advertised pornography. It is so bad that I watched about half of it, then took the DVD and threw it in the trash where it deservedly belongs. Don't waste your money on this one."
4,Interesteing,"Interesting movie, well acted. It has some almost Fellini-like grotesque moments, but I really like this film. It is a record of the 70's when it was made. I do not think that you could make such a movie with fine actors, and all the sex today. This movie was from the more liberated sexual days of the 70's and is a marvelous document of such. Well worth seeing. And a telling of the history of Caligula and the social extravegances of the wealthy roman aristocracy."
1,Only the real Caligula,Only the real Caligula could be entertained by this movie...and that is pushing it. No wonder Gore Vidal had his name removed from the project. No other words for this other than...AWFUL!!
4,Roman Nuptials- Or you're putting your fist where?,"I got to warn you... this is nothing like the BBC's I, Claudius. Oh my no! Tons of nakedness and sexy sexiness.Not for children, kid's got no business watching this sort of hanky-panky! I think it should be against the damn law!Oh goodness. Also, the sea of freaks-sex show part in Tiberous magic cave almost put me over the edge. Wowzers! Is this stuff true? I never heard of some of the stuff going on in the background of that bad news bear.Also, Ben Hur was not in this movie at all, not even played by another actor. And if I remember what our adult Sunday school teacher (the pastor's wife) told us correctly, I think that he and Caligula were friends.I don't know what to beleive anymore.I hoped this helped you... I love you."
1,historical,"I thought this was going to be a history of the movie/people--but it was just an xxxporn movie. I was ""very"" disappointed as was my husband. The acting was very poor also."
2,Well acted porno,"An worthy story about a decadent time. However the graphical sex, and nudity distract from what otherwise would be a good movie. I bought a copy of this, then had to destroy it. I could have saved myself the time and the money, not to mention the ""mental invasion"" had I noticed that Bob Guccioni and Penthouse were the producers. This movie could, and should have been filmed with more discretion, however it is obvious to me that it was an opportunity from the beginning to somehow legitimize an industry that is systematically destroying our culture. No thanks Bob. The sex in this film is explicit and real, including the orgies. This is something I would hope that our culture has risen above. But it seems some of us would leap at the chance to re-create it and sensationalize it. What's next? A murder movie with a real murder in it?"
1,UGGGHHHH!!! GIVE ME BACK MY STAR!!!!!,"Incest, bestiality, homosexuality, lesbianism, fisting, all wrapped up in an absolute mess of a movie! I'm no prude when it comes to sex and violence, but this is way over the top. Bought it simply out of curiosity...what a disappoinment..If you have any interest at all in the history of ancient Rome, buy the series ""I, Claudius"". DO NOT be taken in with all of the hype being made here over this movie! DVD picture is grainy and dark at best."
3,Surprise,"The most surprising thing about this movie is that with an international cast of in some cases classical actors (Gielguid, O'Toole Mirren ) it is so pornographic. If you look closely you then realise that the name actors don't actually participate in the steamier scenes and probably were not even there when they were shot. The surprise is to sit down expecting a Ben Hur type movie and end up watching porn. Does this make it a bad movie? maybe not but it does not make it a good movie either.The documentary is hilarious and worth the cost alone. 3 Stars for fascination value."
2,Remastered? or re-edited?,"I SAW this movie on the big screen 20 years ago. Now I see it is digitally re-edited... poor scene transitions and crops when not needed. The color and sound is still great, except when the sound STOPS at a bad edit. It's still watchable, but barely. I was going to put it in my ""must keep"", but the flimsy box is also disappointing. For the most part the acting and timing are perfect."
5,sex and drugs but no rock n' roll,"""Caligula"" made a tremendous attempt at recreating the look and feel of the Roman Empire.The movie was way ahead of its times, had the movie debuted in today's world it would have been much better received."
1,Most controversial film ever made,"In the hype for this movie they claim it is the most controversial film ever made. The only controversy I can imagine is whether or not this is the worst movie ever made. I could only watch about 20 minutes of it. I have only myself to blame for purchasing it, but my defense mechanisms want to blame another entity for this scam. Amazon...shame on you. You should pay us to take this trash out of your inventory! Ah, just thought of another controversy. How in hell did Guiccione (or however he spells his name) manage to get marquee names like McDowell, Mirren, Gielgud etc. associated with this travesty?"
2,Interesting,an interesting movie. I wasnt expecting huge production value I mostly wanted to see what all the hype about it was and I found that out. yes its shocking( in a 70's kinda way) but really no different then watching current shows like spartacus.
2,Misplaced Curiosity,"First off, I must admit that I have been intrigued and tantalized for many years by all of the scandalous hype that has surrounded this film - particularly the lewd and lascivious scorn heaped upon it by many of its critics. By and large, I must say that I find myself agreeing with much that has been said. If you enjoy viewing scenes of wicked and evil debauchery, this might well be a cup of tea to please your taste buds. It most definitely is not mine."
3,...,"Well, this is a hard one to review. On an exploitation-flick scale, it's five stars, no doubt; this is about as trashy a major-distribution film as I can think of.As far as actual quality, well...O'Toole is a lot of fun to watch (although personally I get more B-film thrills watching him in THE STUNT MAN), McDowall is also pretty good as Caligula, and there's some OK hardcore footage (well-shot at the very least).It's worth checking out as long as you don't get yourself all hyped up for ""The most controversial film of all time""...just watch it with the same mindframe you'd use to watch, say, ILSA: SHE-DEVIL OF THE S.S., or a low-budget slasher flick, and you'll have a heck (can I say that here?) of a time."
1,Old,Didn't finish this movie. It was old and disgusting. I loved the series ROME and thought it might be good. I was so wrong!
3,Comment on Goore Vidal's Caligula,"Malcolm McDOWELL stars in this mixture of adult and standard film elements. Caligula did many evil things in his short reign, but according to Vidal he was not necessarily insane."
4,Caligula,"This is a major production with good cinematic values. Story drags a little, but overall is compelling."
5,Sick & twisted? Yes. Historically accurate? Kinda.,"Got the unrated version so that it wasn't all cut up. I swear Americans are kind of backward at seeing flesh, but since I'm American I understand the Disney mentality - yet I guess that's what might spark more interest in these kinds of flix. Plus Ed hadn't seen the full on version so I HAD to add it to our vid library collection. A must-see IF you're mature enough to handle it.The reason I say not historically accurate is that recent digs show that Caligula (Gaius Cesar) more than likely really DID try to invade Briton (aka Britain) and not just fight reeds; history notes that he died alone when leaving the gladiator games arena for lunch but his wife and child were indeed purported to have been killed as shown.Just Google true history on it and you'll be more enlightened - if you have time - reading / watching weird stuff is just a hobby of mine. I don't limit me from any kind of knowledge ;-)"
4,a great big freakshow,"I bought the unrated version of this interesting flick. I think everyone should see it at least once it their lives. Malcom McDowell (clockwork orange, tank girl) is an excelent actor and this work shows it. Plus the porn side of it is pretty cool too."
2,The unrated version is the only one worth watching!,"I saw this film in all of its forms from the time it was first released in NYC as a rated XXXX film in 78' to the tamer version of this one here in 79'.Trust me when I say that the unrated/xxx version is the only version to see. I am a very prudish viewer to begin with. There is way too much detail to miss in this R rated version. In today's standards, It is not such a big deal."
1,Caliqula (Unrated),"I purchased this because I thought it was about the excesses of the Roman Empire. It was so awful and offensive that I stopped viewing it half way through. Next morning I threw it in the dumpster because I certainly couldn't give it to anyone else. Now that I think about it, the library may have accepted it...too late now!"
3,Blue Ray???????,Sorry this Imperial edition of Caligula though somewhat improved does not look blue ray quality. The blue ray designation is somewhat misleading.
1,Stay away.,"This movie doesn't even qualify as a good ""bad"" movie. It is totally joyless. The ""sex"" scenes are turn-offs. Everything was done poorly.Please don't waste your time."
1,Disturbing is not a strong enough word...,"I saw this ""film"" in its original released and it haunts me to this day. I remember some major cinema chains refused to show it and they were correct. The only intriguing part was the idea that the cast made up a late seventies all-star team of British film actors who proved that money is truly everything by agreeing to be part of this thing.I recall the review in the Boston Phoenix at the time which, if I am paraphrasing it correctly, said something like: Garbage over time equals swill; swill in great quantity equals poison.Run away..."
3,WORTH WATCHING - BUT DON'T BE SQUEAMISH!,"This movie is a must see for any fan of Ancient History - or more particularly - Ancient Rome. Caligula is sure to shock, arouse and make your stomach turn.. but will keep you captivated till the very end. Be warned, if you are offended by graphic sex and violence then this movie is not for you."
1,Nothing was there,A huge portion of the movie was cut and it was a waste of money. I have seen this movie before and it was a long movie unlike this.
4,Cult Classic: this copy is reasonably price but has budget cover,"I've seen hard to find copies of this movie going for $80 and up, so the price is right here, but the cover, and complete lack of inner liner notes, seems cheap/cutting corners. The movie itself is quite the shock parade of some huge names in acting, and I think a great opportunity is overlooked by not including an inner liner with all the wild stories about the hijinx in making this film."
3,"Yes, it's true...","When people refer to this movie as ""pornographic"", they are 110% correct. Many people refer to late night Cinemax, Showtime, and HBO as ""pornography""...Therefor, when someone is told this movie is porn, they just don't realize that it really is graphic hardcore porn. Yes, graphically hardcore.None of the following are simulated; they are the real thing:-close up penatration-oral sex (extremely graphic)-homosexual oral sex (male and female)-ejaculations, including one orally-urination (male and female)I am honestly surprised that this item is available on Amazon.It is 110% graphic hardcore porn, with horrible acting within the brief periods between the sex scenes.If you are looking for an educational film on ancient Rome, this is not for you.If you enjoy X-rated films, this one may be for you."
3,Does this really shock anyone anymore?,"I can see how shocking and ground breaking this film may have been at the time it debuted, but today it seems more campy than controversial. McDowell's Caligula, and just about every other charater is cartoonish and surreal. The sets are bathed in artificial pools of colored lights, the cast looks scrubbed and shiny. It is all pure fantasy, a la Tinto Brass (and Guccione), and therefore there is always a sense of disconnect between viewer and character(s). If one of the main themes was to show man's inhumanity to man, then the film fails. Still, everyone should see it once. Caligula would make a GREAT remake, ...too bad Kubrick is gone. Maybe after losing his latest Oscar, Scorsese will say, ""what the hell?"" and do a controversial, realistic Caligula of his own."
3,Practically a porno,"The story is good, and it really captures the sick man that Caligua was, but it's practically a porno. I should have known this, being that it was made by Penthouse, but I guess I wasn't paying attention. To be perfectly honest, the movie was worth watching, but I wouldn't purchase it. Rent it if you can."
4,"Behind all the madness and lust, lies a good man!","'Caligula' the film may have mixed opinions, though the film delt with extreme explicity, it also had delt with true and genuine emotions of Caligula. A strong lust, yet a truthful love for his sister Drisulla has been potrayed very well, for throughout the film, you may feel Caligula had cared for his sister more than any other being in the world and when she dies, you give out your heart to her brother, who couldn't be any broken. This is one outstanding chemistry and McDowell does it again! after 'O lucky man' this is the second film that does really potray his talent very well. This film maynot be adequette in terms of its historical events, but the situations are very realistic. Behind a lusty man, a womanizer, lies a good soul somewhere in the man 'Caligula'. Give it a chance, you won't be dissapointed."
3,Caligula DvD,"I generally like period films, and historically accurate films. However, I found Caligula disturbing, and a bit too graphic for my taste. Even if it is historically accurate, I found the sex scenes gratuitous. The making Caligula, on the dvd is informative. Sometimes the video and sound quality aren't what they should be. The movie is well cast, and for me that saves the movie and makes it worth having. This is probably the only time you see a cast this good in a movie this graphic. No one under 21 should be allowed to see it."
2,Hard Core Porn,"This movie is an attempt to make a film with respected actors and high production values that also contains scenes of hard core sex where NOTHING is left to the imagination.Just a warning to those who might accidentally buy it who would be offended.The film itself is rather boring.What popularity it DOES enjoy is pretty much due to the novelty of a ""high quality""porn flick,and the fact that as an unrated film you can get it from outlets that would not carry X or NC-17 films."
1,One of the worst movies I've seen. B-movie wanna be.,"I can't believe the good ratings that some people give this movie! [It really sucks.] Way over-hyped! Poor acting, stupid story, bland sex, boring, and looks like a really low budget B movie. The set is really cheap looking. In many scenes it looks like you're watching a play on stage! And all this controversy about the sex, a lot of R rated movies have better sex scenes. Definately don't waste your money. Not even worth a rental."
1,terrible,"how anybody could find this movie erotic is beyond me.the nudity,violence and just overall production of this piece of junk is so distasteful that it truly upset me.theres so many good films why waste your time?do not make the same mistake i made and skip this god awful contrived piece of garbage.easily one the 10 worst movies ever made!"
4,Reality Check on this film,"Caligula the movie with Malcolm McDowell is not the only film that graphically displays the depravity of Rome but is the most famous.The film is about as accurate as the classic Cleopatra with Liz Taylor.The film is not as depraved as reality in some caes mostly in homosexual terms. EX: Tiberius little fishes were mostly if not 100% young boys in the film they are all women. None of Caligula's homosexual affairs are in the film. Supposedly there were only a few emperors that were not bisexual.The movie is funny at times and overall depicts Caligula better than history did. Newer history has redeemed him a bit and this movie might have spurned it. Great acting , this is not a hack movie.The newest versions of this film contain additional porn so no need for the newest versions this one has all the acting."
2,"Pornographic, yes. Boring, yes. Interesting, no.","TURNED OFF MOVIE WITHIN THE FIRST 10 MINUTES.I had always wanted to own the film; I remember when it was released. I had never seen the edited or unedited version before, nor was exactly I sure who Caligula was. I turned the movie off after the first hour; there was absolutely nothing redeeming about it. I've seen pornography before, but unless you are addicted to it, it didn't phase me at all. It was like a DVD version of Penthouse Magazine. It was slow, it was ""messed up,"" like Guggione is/was, but it's the S L O W E S T movie I've ever seen, and it doesn't even bother me that I don't like it. Just wanted a copy for my library."
5,classic american adult ent!!,"i own the single disc re-release of this film which i bought in 2007 by image ent(general media ent) as ""the unrated edition"" and is the same time frame and widescreen.because of how extreme the sex(uality) is for a film of this nature, it's a rareocassion when i do watch it because the devient behavior going on makes my jaw dropin shock, almost making me want to shut it off. but because i have a daring mind,i don't. for those with innocent minds and weak stomachs, i strongly discouragebuying this film. those with a firm grip on reality whom want a very close representation of caligula's true crazed state of mind, buy it if you dare!"
1,Rated vs. Unrated,Don't make the mistake I made. Get the unrated version. The rated version is a waste of time and money.
2,the raunchy romans,"I remember going to the cinema in the early 1970s to see ""Caligula"".I must have come away with some positive feelings about the movie then.Ah,how the passage of time can make us see things in a different light.This movie is mostly pretty disgusting.Some scenes had me reaching for the remote.There is little of history and much sensationalism here.Malcolm McDowell does his very naughty boy act to a tee.Not much can be said for John Gielgud and Helen Mirren who made bad career decisions by agreeing to be in this sordid little lot.My advice to the potential viewer: get hold of a book about Caligula and find out what really happened.If you must watch the movie,don't do it before or after meals."
3,Definitely NOT for the faint of heart or squeamish.,"Vague memories of this film brought great surprise when watching this Uncut DVD edition. This movie is crude and tough to swallow in its graphic nature. It really depicts a very decadent time in history in a very realistic manner, which makes it all the harder to watch without ultimate disgust in some scenes. I must give credit to the film and filmakers for having the courage to show that moment in history in all its nastiness. There are some excellently filmed and directed erotic scenes which really show what kind of films the porn industry could probably do with the right budget.The movie can be slow and painful but it is well acted (McDowell and O'Toole really do a great job) and the crude reality of the time is a good lesson for us not to repeat the past.In conclusion, I cannot recommend this movie as it is not for everyone (Definitely a 21+ film). My opinion is that you should perhaps rent this DVD if possible before purchase."
1,Pfffft!,This is the worst film I've ever watched. Ed Wood couldn't have taken this story and made anything less watchable. A stellar cast failed to rescue this from the pit. I recommend you save your money and find something else to watch.
1,Caligula,A few big name actors but a very gross and brutally sadistic movie with minimum continuity. It is a big problem for any hearing impaired viewer as all conversations are not clear and to my surprise there were no captions. Quite interesting and informative comments on the many sided CD jacket.
3,Caligula (The unrated version),"McDowall is excellent as the central character. Apart form O'Tool[is O'Tool acting?]the other characters are reduced to appearances at certain times in the footage. Mirren's talents are completely wasted. The film is a collection of scenes that offer snap shots of events [real and imagined]rather than tell a story. And the story line deviates from history - for what purpose? There is enough historical data on which to compose a script, and all of it useful - but forall of its shortcomings including a rather boring brothel scene towards the film's conclusion it remains a remarkable film for the time it was made.It is well worth a look and remains compulsive viewing.And one last thing - it is too long and even the edited version cannot get over the lack of continuity of sequences."
3,"Interesting, but...","Weird, 70's porn with some great actors thrown in for a tiny bit of redeming social value. Money could have been better spent, but OK for a cheap thrill."
2,Caligula,"The story had possibilities given the cast. However, it was ruined by the graphic violence and the orgy scenes. I think all that was driven by Guccione's pretenious ego."
1,improperly identified,"Very Dissatisfied. DVD was ""incompatible"" for use with normal equipment. Appears to have been manufactured for UK market.This fact not part of the item description."
2,Caligula (The Unrated Edition),"What drew me to purchasing this item was that I was lead to believe by the reviews attached to it is that it came with a commentary track where Mirren, O'Toole and others discussed the film. Alas this was not the case and all you get is the film which is nothing to write home about. Hearing the well renowned actors explain how they landed in this debacle though would have been worth the price of admission on it's own. Worth purchasing if heavily reduced in price for curiosity value only. I think the two disc set, although 'cut', would prove better value for movie enthusiasts.Caligula (The Unrated Edition)"
5,good,the only movie that seams to be a xxx rated with a story plot i dont understand how its not rated .But its a good movie the romans knew how to live and have fun if its base on being true
2,x rated,Very contoversial in its debut. Wanted to see what all the hype was about. Not very impressed very violent with very graphic sex scenes. More like a porn flick with vilence thrown in.
3,"Whoo Boy! (and girl, and girl/girl and beast, etc)","Usually I am not one to type spoilers on films and since I still have not managed to make it thru this entire movie there will be none, but about 100 minutes into the unrated version, I started to squirm...it's not solely the issue of sex and who has sex with what gender, etc...just that how it was presented was hard for me to deal with. Maybe that I felt that several of the great actors (Peter O'Toole as one of them) convinced me so completeley that this was really taking place that I squirmed. I think that the sets and actors are truly amazing and plan to finish watching the rest of the movie within the next few days or so. Not for family viewing at all and the unrated version is quite graphic; not just in the sex scenes, but in the general perversion of Tiberius' sereglio and Caligula's following descent into darkness and depravity. View with caution. Not your average porno, by any stretch."
5,Graphic but very good film,"No matter what some books give this (a turkey of one star) Ithink this is a great film. It is debauche at it greatest, andMalcolm Mcdowell and Peter O'Toole are great. Why not include suchscenes of graphic... after-all ancient Rome must have been like thatin many ways. Highly recomended for any history buff."
3,DAMN IT!! I SAW THE WRONG ONE!!!!!!,"I have learned a valuable lesson. The burgendy copy of this dvd is not the version to see. It is not the uncut version.I was only disappointed with the r rated edition, not with McDowell's tour de force performance (he even looks like the marble statues of Caligula!)DO NOT SEE THE BURGENDY COVER EDITION! IT IS CUT TO PIECES!PURPLE IS GOOD!!!!"
2,"It was hot ""back in the day"" at theatres...but not anymore","I saw the first run of this strange film back in 1980 I think...and my date and I both thought it was a hot film...except for the gory parts that weren't as interesting as some of the sex scenes. But a few years ago I bought the DVD and watched in amazement at how badly this film comes off today. Its as if its an ""R"" movie trying to be an ""X"" movie. Nothing shocking in the sex department...and hey...what else matters in this type of film? We are not ""freaky"" if we just want to watch Star Wars or something....the film was produced by the man who owns Penthouse Magazine...and he was a freak...back in the day...but time has made this film look cheap and less than interesting now...Capt. Freaky says ""save your money on this one""!"
1,Boring!!!,"It is hard to imagine how sex of every description and violence of every sort could be boring, but without feeling, a focused story line, and decent acting, that is exactly what happens in Caligula. I was titilated by the thoughts of what might happen in this movie, but my imaginings were much more exciting than the reality of the film. Buy yourself a good book instead!"
2,From evils past and evils yet to come...,"""What shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul"" Mark 8:36The Blu-ray treatment really brings out the visuals of naked women and white horses.I have to confess this type of film is not my cup of tea. I just wanted to see a young version of many famous actors. Introductive music sounds an awful like Serguei Prokofiev was not only an accomplished composer of the twentieth century.I am surprise that mixed with all the phony debauchery there is a real story. This is the only thing that brings it up a notch from ""Fellini Satyricon"" (1969)"
2,Poorly done,While I like to see naked women just like most guys this is just tasteless. I had to turn it off about 20 minutes into the movie just to keep from barfing.
2,slow movie plot,The movie quality was as if the dvd was restored over and over which the picture was not always clear in many of the seems. Reminded me of watching a silent movie because sound was also restored. The adult scenes were not interesting as it was the typical showing of adult nudity. Would not rent again or reccomend to rent. It was a very old film production done on a low budget.
1,caligula (unrated edition),"Since movies began back in the early 1900's there has never been a more boring, stupid, plot. It even has legimatestars at least a couple that is.It is not even titalating, it's just nothing from start to finish. The owner ""Penthouse"" made this disaster and itprobably speeded his death.Be warned are you will be bored out of your mind."
1,Worst historical film ever made,"IF youre looking for an interesting sadist porn, with comic book costume design, this is your movie. If you want a serious historic account, keep looking. The film seems to romanticize the suffering and cruelty inflicted by this man. Too much fixation on graphic, artistic recreations of sexual violence, while almost ommitting the greater portion of his violence against people in every forum of life. The scene where he rapes the bride and groom was an insult to what those people really went through. Total downplay of the violence inflicted. His victims are surely rolling over in their ancient graves."
1,Don't waste your time,Terrible movie. I wish I could get the time back I spent in front of the TV. It was my fault for not turning it off.
2,BORING,"I found Caligula (unrated version) to be boring. Historically accurate or not, the sex scenes seem inserted just to have sex scenes. Maybe that was the intention. Maybe Guccione was trying to ""gross people out."" I don't think I'm being prudish by pointing this fact out. Overall, I found it difficult to focus on the acting or any other redeeming quality. The movie, as another reviewer said, drags on and on. About one-quarter of the way into the film, I wanted it to end. I am amazed that any viewer could rate this movie any higher than three stars . . . for any reason. Don't waste your money."
4,"I like it but the wife, not so much",I have always liked this movie but the wife watched it for the first time and said that it was to grusome and incoherant and she didn't like the brother sister love.
4,An Epic Tale or Bad Porn?,"I read about this movie and the producer several year ago and I was expecting a completely different experience than the one that I got. I thought that since it was a Penthouse film that it would have Penthouse type of material but it also came with a story line that I couldn't believe I was drawn into. I just had to watch it from beginning to end not just to see the over elaborate sex scene but to find out how the story ended. For lack of a better phrase, it was something. Don't be angry if you never get to see this movie in this lifetime! If you do get to see don't tell too many people that you've seen it. Although, I will say, I'm glad I got this movie from here at the price that I paid. Thanks a bunch for watching my pocketbook AMAZON!"
5,Desanitization of History,"Having been an ancient history buff for over 40 years, I've finally come across a film that attempts to dipict the reality of life in countries like ancient Rome. Anyone reading virtually any of the histories of the ancient world must come away wondering why authors continually sanitize the facts of life in that age.It seems that only the ancient historians had the integrity to tell the truth and to attempt to characterize life in those times. Seutonius is one who immediately comes to mind.The film does not attempt to reconstruct all of what it was like to live among the upper classes in Rome but it does attempt to make up for the sanitization of history which we are forced to accept from current historians.For that reason, I believe this is a must see film."
2,Excellent movie but Blu Ray version is awful.,"To be brief, Caligula is a 5 star film for it's realistic portrayal of decadent Rome. Maybe a little over the top with the sex scenes though. The standard dvd version is visually superior to this BD version. The Blu Ray version needs to be re-processed to facilitate a clearer picture. This product gives Blu Ray a bad name. Two stars for Blu Ray version."
2,Amazed,"Not for everyone. It was as expected, but I was disappointed in the acting. McDowell, Geilgud and OToole are good, but I've seen them do better. Perhaps it was the story line, but I thought it to be boring. Got more out of the series on PBS in I, Claudius."
3,dvd quality reply,I see that a couple of reviews of the dvd people were complaining about the quality of the dvd picture aND SOUND... WELL.. SINCE i DO qc AT THE COMPANY THAT REMASTERED IT.. i'M SAD TO SAY THAT DIGITAL REMASTERING CAN ONLY BE AS GOOD AS THE DIGIBETAS THEY COME FROM.. sorry about the caps.. but the film was huge.. they aded the hour long behind the scenes.. this makes for bad compression.. sorry... blame the folks at image ent. for a bad tape.. but it looks like it did when it came out... bad...
4,Caligula Review,"This review is for the Blu-ray release of Caligula The Emperial Edition by Image Entertainment. It includes a new high def transfer of the unrated, uncensored feature film and an alternate pre-release version. It has full length audio commentaries with Malcolm Mcdowell,Helen Mirren and writer Ernest Volkman. I enjoyed this movie but I would caution against having young children in the room while viewing. There are scenes of murder, rape, sodomy, orgies, midget fellatio, and incest. Over all a fun movie to enjoy with friends for those ""Roman"" nights."
1,Highly edited version,"I recall seeing the original movie when I was 18 or 19..(1979) and after 30 years, someone mentioned the movie again, so I thought to purchase it. This is a highly edited version and I would not recomend wasting the money to purchase it."
4,Caligula...,"I saw this movie in a theatre back in 1984. A friend of mine had told me about ""Caligula"" back in 1981, but I had missed my chance to see it! Gaius Caligula lived one heck of a life! According to Mssrs. Tacitus and Suetonius (Roman historians), Caligula and (his uncle?) Tiberius had some swinging times, which, in my view, explained how they could justify some of the scenes that they showed in the movie. Personally, I can't said that I enjoyed it, but found it fascinating none-the-less! This review is for the ""unrated"" version. For a ""skin"" flick, some serious cash was spent on this work - 4 stars!"
1,Pure perversion,"I didn't think of it much as a movie as I did a porn frenzy. I'm very much interested in history and also psychology and neither was apparent to me in this movie other than we know Caligula was nuts. Otherwise, then I guess so was all of the Roman Empire. I simply cannot believe one stroll down the streets would produce such frenzy. It was stupid, simple and as soon as it was done I immediately threw it out. Not for the faint of heart. Not for the sophisticated either. Or anywhere in between."
1,Seriously?,"This is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Is any of it based on fact (other than the existence of Caligula)? Here's my point: I don't care. If each scene was recorded in a scroll discovered by an archeologist (or film producer)in Rome, it still comes off as a vehicle for Bob Guccione to couch soft porn in a respectable setting. I only gave it one star because I'm afraid if I don't give it any stars the review won't get in the system, and I don't know how to give negative stars."
1,HORRIFIC EXCESS....,"Huge, lavish expansive vehicle for depicting every sort of depravity imaginable (or even UNimaginable). Financed by Penthouse (of course), ""Caligula"" manages to trot out good ""name"" actors to give a pornographic film some respectability. Too bad. The film is historically debatable on any count and no one's watching this excrement on film for history anyway. I truly believe you can pay Malcolm McDowall to do anything but Helen Mirren is totally debased here. Scatalogical in the extreme, ""Caligula"" stands as a total embarrassment to one and all. Camera work is downright poor at times. Mcdowall hams it up unmercifully and really seems to be enjoying the hideous things he does. A total gross-out for people who like watching bloody car accidents. Help yourself."
1,"Controversial, Purile, Revolting - and boring......","I saw Caligula when it was first in theaters. It was one of those movies that all my friends said we had to see, because it was so controversial. Controversial it is. Good it is not.I've heard through the years that Sir John Gilgud did not know that the part he was playing would be in a film showing explicit sexual acts and degredation. I find this hard to believe, given the producer of the film - it was Penthouse magazine.That said, Caligula is dull, dull, dull. It is only the scenes of horror and sexual predation that make this film rise above the sublimely mind numbing - and that's really sad.You know you're going to watch it, because you're curious, but just know this: after you watch this repugnant film, if you're anything like me, you'll want to bathe afterward. It's really a creepy gross film."
1,"Great actors, but a bad movie","Never before have I seen such bad acting by such great actors in what could have been a great epic. Malcolm McDowell and Peter O'Toole completely disappointed me in this poorly written and poorly directed screenplay. In an attempt to portray, in explicit scenes, the decadence of Rome during the rule of Caligula, the producers and directors turned this film into nothing less than a big-budget, ... fiasco. If you enjoy stupidity at its best in a movie, this is the one for you."
1,An unintended joke?,"This movie sits right up there with ""Showgirls"" as one of the most outrageously BAAAAAAAAD films ever made---the script, direction, acting, camera work, production values...are just unbelievably cheesy.About the only half-OK parts of the film are the sex and nudity, a few of which are really twisted and difficult to watch (e.g. Caligula's intrusion into a wedding party during which he violates both bride and groom).Many people have panned Guccione's sad attempt at high art as ""pornography""---I certainly agree in that most porno films, you constantly find yourself fast forwarding to all the sex scenes.Sad, when considering what a true cinematic genius like Stanley Kubrick could've done with this material."
3,All right all right,"It was a good movie that I wanted to own. And I love malcolm McDowells movies, great actor. I tell all my friends about this movies."
3,Don't watch this with Amazon Instant Video,"This movie is excellent and depicts Rome as it was. Do yourself a favor and do not watch it with Amazon Instant Video. The video bounces all over, is of poor quality, and doesn't do this movie justice."
2,ok,"Movie kept freezing, and the dialog keep hesitating, all in all the acting wasn't as good as I had hoped, but I at least got the jist of the movie."
3,"Friends, Romans, Countrymen - Lend Me Your Ears","Chances are you already know what Caligula is about and that the movie took sex combined with violence and integrated it into the film in a new way previous to 1979. If you are not familiar with these things, then you should review some of the other reviews before making a purchasing decision.Malcolm McDowell acted in the film, but did not perform nearly as well as he did in Clockwork Orange or Evilenko, (two much better films to buy if you are a Malcolm McDowell fan like me), although I am sure he had fun. However, Teresa Ann Savoy does great job acting in my opinion.Overall, I like the film and will watch it again. The part that is annoying is that on the DVD back cover it states, ""this landmark production is now presented in a beautiful new high-definition transfer from recently uncovered negative elements"". This is a huge marketing stretch, the DVD transfer is dark and grainy, and so keep in mind you have been warned if this is a concern of yours."
3,Caligula,"I wanted to see what all the controversy was over the making of this film. Caligula is an interesting movie and, what the filmmakers consider to be, a truthful account of life in Rome. Some of the scenes seemed to be there for shock value only, but are not as shocking today as when the film was originally made, but still might shock some. One of the scenes in particular, would still be considered shocking and vulgar because of it's mixture of violence and sex. The movie drags on a bit, again in order to add scenes for shock value. If you want to see what life was really like in Rome (perhaps), then this is an alternative depiction from what one normally sees on the History Channel. This movie doesn't seriously offend (although it tries), nor does it seriously enthrall."
5,Not for the weak,"AMAZING performance by Malcolm Mcdowell.. acting is top-notch, story-line in enthralling.. not for those who find hardcore porn distasteful, however.. one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen, combining the raw sex and violence of a Kubrick film with the occasionaly randomness of a Lynch.."
3,R-Rated brought it down,"I didn't think to see the rating for this movie because I didn't think there was an R-Rated version. I know this movie had to be made for everyone to be able to watch it, but having this rating brings the movie down. I watched the unrated version and it had scenes in there that will make you cringe. If you take away all of the evil that Caligula wrought, then you don't have the full essence of the film. If you are going to watch this watch the original version. A warning though, I thought it was almost a porno inside the first 5 minutes. Really not suitable for anyone less than 18."
3,Visual and sound quality not upto DVD standards,"The movie is well acted and the story is compelling enough although it deals with the depraved side of humanity. It illustrates the contrasting splendor and raunch that was Rome at the time. The film is beautifully done and impressive in many scenes, but the visual quality is lacking. The resolution and clarity is not what is normally expected with a DVD. Sound quality is also mediocre at best. It appears to be the same quality of a VHS movie that was made 20 years ago. Too bad... I hoped the original film quality could be preserved digitally on DVD.The featurette discussing the making of the film was interesting addition to the DVD. Unfortunately subtitles are not provided."
1,So Filthy it should be illegal,"This film was so sexually explicit that I broke down and cried several times during the viewing. How am I supposed to be a good, patriotic, sexually repressed American when such filth is in my DVD library. I am shocked that Bob Guccione would produce a film with so much nudity. I thought he had class. I guess I expected more of a light-hearted romantic comedy with a little bit of Roman Empire thrown in."
5,Must see,"What a great movie. Anyone who sees this film will say ""dang, he put his fist in the guys what?"" and, ""watch the wine burst from the guys stomach how?"" or, ""that girl's his what? Can't be. No way... Dang... They'd have kids with 2 heads or 3 arms or something. Dang..."""
3,Very Interesting,"This film is very graphic, but very interesting. Don't turn it off because you see some nudity or something else that is vile...get through the whole story and then judge it. Not a great movie, but is was lavishly done."
2,I like Porno - Do you?,"This film is not great. If you happen to buy the rated version you are wasting your money because half the porno is cut out. If you but the unrated version you are wasting your money because it just becomes a porno. I would recommend, if you want a bit of porno and a bit of a storyline too, to get Eyes Wide Shut. It looks better and it's a better film too."
3,Caligula would be pleased.,"Honestly, as bad as this excuse for cinema was in as much as it tried to be both a biopic and a skin flick, I really didn't hate it. Malcom MacDowell (the reason I watched it to begin with) is fascinating onscreen and always brims with a kind of unrestrained energy in his roles. For Caligula this was a perfect match as his mad dottering around and over the top virtuosity led very much to being a fine Caligula. Of note especially, the scene with the newlyweds recalled his performance of Alex with the same kind of smug cruelty on his face. Aside from everything else, I honestly think Caligula himself would be pleased at this unrestrained, slightly off picture."
2,dvd review,"I am a true history buff. After watching the story of Caligula on the History Channel, I decided to buy the movie. I was truly disappointed. The story line was weak and riddled with strong vulgar sex scenes that were unnecessary as to WHO or WHAT Caligula was or was about. Although Caligula was sexually perverted, the movie never went into great detail as to WHY he was that way. If it had explained the young Caligula in greater depth instead of concentrating on his sexual deviances, then maybe the movie would have made more sense as to why he was he was weird.Therefore, this was just another senseless porno that was based on a true story."
3,More sex than needed,"While I was prepared for some hard core porn, I felt it was way over the top as the story could easily have been told with less in your face sex. Actually it seemed to interfere with the story line at times.I Claudius tells the tale just as well (or better) without a lot of disgusting sex. I am not the least bit a prude ... just too much of it."
5,Caligula,"Oh geez, where to begin?It is certainly as gaudy as Cleopatra, but much much smuttier. But who are you kidding? If you want Caligula, it's not for the attention to historic detail.To be honest, I'm still stuck on the firast disc, I haven't yet plumbed the depths of special features and whatnot.But I can say that this has to be one of the most intriguing pieces I've seen in my short life.And I am waiting for the 2008 remake- because that will seal the envelope and tuck it in a corner, rather than rip it to shreds..."
3,Not as bad or as good as some say...,"After viewing the Unrated DVD of ""Caligula"" I felt that it is an overhyped film. I don't know how historicaly accurate it is, but those offended by heavy doses of violence need not apply. Basically it is a dramatically mediocre movie with hard core porn and repellent violence throughout. Some of the sets are impressive, ""Caligula"" could have benefited from better camerawork. The acting is good (under the circumstances) and McDowell does a good portrayal of insanity. All in all, its worth watching, but you're not missing anything if you haven't seen it."
3,Caligula unrated,"I had always heard that this was a really good movie so when I saw it coming available on dvd I got it. The film is very well made, with fine performances by the actors, but it nearly blew me away. I got the unrated version, figuring they cut out graphic violence and excessive nudity in the r rated. It is full of hardcore graphic sex acts of all types, including homo sexuality. I do wish that I had gotten the r rated version, then maybe I wouldn't be to embarrassed to watch it with anyone else. It will definitly be put up from the wrong eyes. Wow!"
1,Not for the faint of heart,"I rented this movie once and couldn't finish it; it was too gory! Compared to some of the acts of torture in this movie, Abu Gharib was a walk in the park. There's also plenty of graphic nudity and sex, which can be a bit off-putting, especially when it higlights Emperor Caligula's somewhat outré tastes. Nowadays, he might be classified as a sexual predator and/or a serial rapist.This film is not intended to be historically accurate (which is virtually impossible, anyway*), and lives up to its' billing as the first $15 million porno film ever. Watch it if you dare, but don't say I didn't warn you!*There are very few accurate historical sources on the reign of Emperor Gaius (Caligula), A.D. 37-41. For more information, SEE: (...)."
4,Not For Your Mother-in-Law..??,"This movie took me by surprise.. With a great cast of actors I knew this was going to be a good movie. What I didn't realize was how sexuality graphic it was. Now this doesn't bother me, but I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who would be heading for the door.. pronto. This movie has everything in it, mass killings, murder, rape, incest, humiliation and porno. I don't think I missed anything. If none of the above bother's you too much then you should enjoy the movie."
2,Just disappointed,"I finally broke down and bought the movie. It does have some decent sex scenes, it's just very choppy. I am not sure if they were trying to show how crazy stuff was back then or the movie makers were just unexperience. If you heard of this movie and just wanted to see it for all it's hype and still don't know. Try to find someone who has it this way you can watch it and save your money."
1,"Unrated, understated.","After reading many many reviews, I purchased the unrated Korean version, thinking it would have less editing. Totally the opposite. I would have a hard time rating this ""R"". It is more like ""PG"". The only reason it wouldn't be ""G"" is that there was a tiny bit of blood and I think I saw three breasts. Having seen the film in 1979 this version is a complete disappointment."
3,The R rated version is better,"Probably, people are primarily interested in this movie because of its reputation as expensive porn, in which case the old R rated version is passe. However, honestly, it's the better version. Take away the endless, lengthy gratuitous explicit porn and violence, and you can see this is actually a pretty good movie with some good acting. I liked this movie when I saw it years ago, and out of curiosity just rented the uncut version. After awhile, I just got bored. Do you want a Penthouse spread or a decent movie? The decision is clear if you know what you want."
3,Caligula,"This film has quite a reputation behind it. judgeing from all the rewiews on this sight i was exspecting 2 1/2 hours or hard core porn and Violence. but its not as exstreme as it has been made out to be.In fact its quite a good film - it has a story, and some great OTT acting from some great British hams.The camera work and Score are a bit heavy handed with its crash zooms and over dramtic high cords, but its all in the spirt of the picture.Over all I enjoyed this film. Even though its not the best Movie I've ever seen its no way the worst."
3,It's got a little of everything,"I do own this, and although I find the sex and particularly the violence realistically graphic to the time and manner of Rome at this juncture in her time, I find alot of the acting just plain sucks. The great O'Toole, Gielgud and even Mirren are all around for alittle time only. We see much more of Malcolm of course, and though he plays ""mad"" well enough, it gets alittle boring and over-the-top. And when he mourns his sister's death, I simply fastforward away from THAT. Otherwise, to quote a (female) friend, ""There are images in it that are burned in my brain forever..."""
2,Don't bother with the edited version!,"I have not yet seen the unedited version of this film but I made the mistake of renting the edited version a few years ago. Don't do it, people! They must have had to cut out so much footage, the plot is completely hard to understand and all of a sudden it's all over. However, it was almost worth it to see Bob Guccione at the end come on screen and say, ""Hello, I'm Bob Guccione. What you have just seen is a drastically edited version of my movie Caligula. I do not approve of censorship. If you would like to order the unedited version through the US mail, where FEDERAL laws, not LOCAL laws apply, please call..."" Believe it or not this short little spiel actually inspired a lengthy intelligent discussion amongst me and my family concerning censorship, etc. But otherwise, stay away!"
5,A VISUAL MASTERPIECE,"THOUGH THIS FILM IS VERY GRAPHIC,IT TAKES YOU BACK IN TIME TO THE DECADANCE OF ROME & GREECE AND YOU BECOME A PART OF LIFE AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN ,IF YOU DARED."
4,"Core Java 2, Volume II - 7th Edition","Having purchased the first editions of Cay Horstmann's two volume Core Java set, I knew that I needed this book when I upgraded to Java 5.0 and began trying to take advantage of its new features. Previously I had been using Java 1.2 and so had quite a learning curve. The book was very helpful. I canvassed nearby bookstores and the library and found nothing as good. Most of the examples I tried worked right out of the book. When they did not it was because my application(s) differed from the author's. That in itself was good. The examples, and text, taught me enough that I could easily fill in the blanks.I have one piece of advise for anyone buying the 7th Edition set. If you have earlier editions, keep them. There is explanation in the 1st edition that is omitted from the 7th edition."
4,Walkthroughs of the core APIs,"This is a nice set of walkthroughs on the basic APIs that are just outside of the core Java language presented in the first book. These include threading, Swing, AWT, JDBC, Networking, JavaBeans and JNI. Some of the coverage is more in-depth than in other parts. In particular Swing and AWT are covered richly, while networking and JNI get shorter shrift.Given that Swing and AWT are not at the core of modern Java development I would have liked to have seen more of this tome sized book spent on threading, JDBC and networking. And it would have been nice to see some serious coverage of EJB. That being said, what is there is well written, has good example code, and effective illustrations."
3,Don't Buy the Kindle Version,"I bought this book hoping to learn more about aspects of Java that I haven't used much. And I guess that goal has been mostly achieved (or is being achieved). As others have said, it isn't an introductory book (which is a plus for me - I didn't want someone explaining what a class is or how to use interfaces).However, I'm very disappointed in the Kindle presentation. Most of the code examples are so small as to be unreadable and remain so no matter how much I enlarge the font. I'm assuming they're some kind of non-scaling image? I still look forward to learning from the book but this is quite an annoying speed-bump!"
1,Kindle edition not a good buy,"Like many reviewers I find the the Core Java series to be very valuable. However, be forewarned that the kindle edition is not a good representation of the book. The figures are completely useless either because they have not taken the time to convert them properly or because the kindle technology is simply incapable of displaying non-text content properly. I wish I had known this before I paid for the kindle edition of this book."
5,Straight forward.,"This is the first edition that I have read, I found it to be very appropriate for my needs."
3,3 1/2 stars,I enjoyed the cultural insights into the Arab-American community and family. The book was rather slow for the first half but then it picks up; the tale she weaves is worth reading. I didn't care for the first two or three pages of each chapter as the main character's uncle tells an ongoing fable from old. The current day story was very interesting but probably not a book for those who want a fast-paced thriller.
3,Mixed feelings,"Abu-Jabar's writing is beautiful with its poeticism, richness, and vivid imagery. A story line dealing with Arab-Americans that treats the subject with humanity and complexity is essential in today's world of suspicion and distrust of the Arab world. That being said, I'm having a hard time finishing this book. I think that the story line moves a little slow for me. Maybe I'm just not into the love story genre. Overall, I would recommend to give this book a chance for the good things that it does have going for it."
1,Awful.,"This was required reading for one of my classes and reading it was about as enjoyable as being choked to death. Sirine, Abu-Jaber's heroine, is described as an exquisite chef of startling, almost unnaatural beauty and seems to be sexually desired by almost every male figure in the book, but I have no idea why. I kept waiting for Abu-Jaber to reveal the character for the reader but it never happened. Sirine is totallt one-dimensional. Yeah, she's a great cook, but the woman is totally without any interesting qualities, has never travelled,is completely uncultured and literally does nothing but cook and when she is not cooking she is either thinking about cooking or is hanging out with sn also unbelievable character, the suave and mysterious Iraqi professor,Hanif. This book is the equivalent of a 21st century dime-store romance. If you are intrested in literature by Arab-American women, do yourself a favor and pick up some poetry by Naomi Shihab Nye instead."
4,Wish it was as cheap as i heard it use to be..,"Works great, looks great, and if it were the price that i heard it use to be than i would buy more...."
2,There needs to be a better restoration for DVD,"Having first seen this film in college in the early 1980s, I was looking forward to seeing it again on DVD. I must say that while the movie itself is fine, the DVD needs work. The colorized version is dreadful. It has reduced the running time of the original film and the colorization is not good. The dubbed English is at times unbearable. The B&W version on the same disc has the original Italian soundtrack with subtitles and has the longer version of the film; however, it is not a clear print. Won't somebody (like Criterion) please do a serious restoration of this film for DVD?"
4,A Great Movie Experience - But Revert Back To Subtitles!,"Pasolini's THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW is by far his best ever work and probably the greatest movie on the life of Jesus ever made.I have this movie on VHS with English subtitles and this will be the one I stick with. Dubbing this movie into English was a big mistake.However, this is still a wonderful movie in it's simplicity. The cast is superb as are the locations and imagery."
2,Buyer beware : Language,"This is an italian movie, with the original language track in italian, and the Synergy box featured is in french. You would expect at least one of these languages, if only in subtitle. The disc I received has an ENGLISH DUB ONLY, and NO subtitle.There was no warning about this in the product specifications, and none even on the box. Deceptive."
2,Great movie - terrible package,"The Gospel According to St. MatthewThe film itself lives up to the hype. I was hoping that the Legend Films release had something more to offer regarding the black and white original version, mainly better subtitles that don't wash out in some scenes, along with a better translation in some scenes as well. The colorized version sucks [like all colorized versions], plain and simple - truncated by 50 minutes to 90 minutes in length, English dubbed, and is not the same experience as watching Passdolini's original vision. It simply represents everything that is wrong with Christian marketing these days - the compromise of artistic integrity for a quick buck. Had Legend Films brought us a truly better print in all its black and white glory with some bonafide extras I could easily overlook the release's shortcomings. Hopefully down the road this masterpiece will get the treatment [Criterion, preferably] it deserves."
2,Picture too dark,"The video of the Gospel according To St. Matthew is of poor video quality. While this is a public domain film, there still should be a half decent video available."
2,The Gospel According to St. Matthew,"I purchased this film as recommended by a devotional I was reading in December.After about 30 minutes my family: a teen, a college student, a forty something wife and self, looked at one another and shrugged. It just didn't appeal to us.The teen found it weird, the college student scary, and my wife thought it hard to watch. I just thought it was a bit too artsy fartsy. I guess we're all too shallow and unrefined, but...we did try.Venice Film Festival gave it three awards, the Academy Awards nominated it for three, and Roger Ebert gave it a big thumbs up.I gave it two of five stars for the score and focused dialog; however, I didn't make it past two-thirds of the film."
2,"It's about Jesus, so it's good, but...","I have to confess, I have not watched all of this, but that's because I found it un-interesting. There are sub-titles and acting, etc. that I didn't like. On the other hand, the DVD ""The Gospel of John"", which I bought at the same time, has suddenly become my favorite movie of all time."
5,A Masterpiece,"This is simply the best religious film, and one of the best films of any kind ever made. It is far away the best treatment of Jesus' life on film. I like the dubbed version because of the excellent quality of Enrico Maria Salerno's voice as Christ. This film has one of the most effective uses of music on film, and the direction is pure poetry. It also remains faithful to the words and emotional feel of Matthew's gospel, and it captures nuances from the other gospels as well. I have been disappointed with other transfers of this film to DVD, but this one works the best for me."
3,The colorized version is terrible,"Don't watch the colorized version! Not only have they colorized a film that could have been made in color had the director wanted, but they have edited out 45 minutes of the movie, changing it from a powerful, meditative film to one that moves far too quickly. It's also dubbed, which is a major distraction, and the English voice of Jesus is not as passionate as that of the original actor.Watch the original, unedited version instead (though it suffers from atrocious subtitles...)!"
2,General,"This book is a good purchase for those of you with no insight about process safety. You will gain some basic knowledge about alarms, sensors etc. Also, you will find some info about methodology. But dont expect much more. To conclude: good for very beginners, not a reference book for seasoned professionals."
2,charges my phone,"not sure exactly how to do any of the other things i should be able to do. package said i may need to use with other software. check with service provider. well, they are not sure what i need either."
3,About half and half,"This was a bit of an adventure. In the first shipment we only got a cable and no CD. We called and a CD was sent and received in a very short time. Then the cable didn't work at all but we had one from a GPS that did. We couldn't get the CD to work with our phones, the Motorola V365. We went to the Cingular store and a lady told us to tell the CD our phones were RAZRs and then it worked fine. I guess we had to sneak up on it."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH V235!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,TOTALLY USELESS! THIS WILL NOT WORK WITH MOTOROLA V235 AS IT IS LISTED! IT WILL NOT WORK AS A MODEM NOR WILL IT WORK AS A CABLE TO DOWNLOAD YOUR PICTURES! IT WILL BE RECOGNIZED ON THE COMPUTER AS A MODEM BUT WHEN YOU TRY TO USE IT LIKE A MODEM (EXAMPLE= TO CONNECT TO DIAL UP INTERNET OR TO USE PHONE DIALER TO CALL FROM COMPUTER) IT JUST WILL NOT CONNECT! WHEN YOU GO TO ADJUST THE ADVANCED CALLING OPTIONS... IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU ACCESS TO THE OPTIONS DUE TO THE DRIVERS! SO IF YOU HAVE A V235... DO YOURSELF A FAVOR... DO NOT BUY THIS! IT MAY ONLY BECOME USEFUL TO CHOKE YOURSELF TO DEATH!
5,SO much better than expected!,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas, the quality of the wood, inlays, finish, interior are so, so, much better than shown in the picture. My husband was very impressed by it. It was by far the best present he received. He had to show it to everyone that was not there on Christmas morning. He even took a picture of it to work to show co-workers! I highly recommend it way over and above the rating of 5 stars. I would give it a 10!"
1,not satisfy,"The slots on this box is very small, and the cushion is very long. I had a hard time trying to fit my 39mm watch into the slot without the leather band scraping against the sides. You can see that the cushion pressed up against the side when you open the box, there is no give, very tight fit. The wood is nice looking and well built, only problem is the slots."
2,"Overpriced, there IS a better option!","We have both this notebook and Joe's Notebook (ASIN B00006JZ93)and there is no comparison, Joe's notebook is ten times better! My 2 1/2 yr old son can't understand why the crayon won't stay in the spiral like Steve's and gets very frustrated. The plastic spiral also is always working it's way out one end and has to be fixed. Some pages ripped out on us, and my son is not hard on toys. It is not worth the money! Buy Joe's Notebook instead, it costs less, includes three rubber stamps, and is so much more fun!!"
4,Not a bad buy -- depending on the price,"My son is 3 1/2 and love blues clues. My daughter is just beginning to like them.I have every notebook, 2 of Steves, 4 of Joes and also the soft pillow one.I have just a few complaints:I have NO idea where to find extra crayons. (...)My son used his up in less than a day.Also, the spiral part keeps coming out. My son also got frustrated because the crayon won't stay in the spiral.I think $12.00 is a little expensive, especially being it only comes with 1 crayon and if your child likes blues clues as much as mine do, they try to copy everything, including the crayon."
2,Trouble,"Kept shorting out my sound card. Caused me no end of trouble, so I put back on the old separated set."
1,Not what I expected,"The length of the 3.5mm audio cords are exactly 11"" from the SVGA connectors. This is not what is pictured on the web site and is not enough to connect to either a 17"" or 15"" laptop if the VGA and audio out are on opposite sides. I will be returning this item and I would caution against buying it if your VGA/audio connections are not close together."
5,works as described,I didn't have any problems using this to connect my laptop to my hdtv. Sound comes out of the t.v. as expected.
1,incompatable between pc (Panasonic ) and tv (vizio),"I believe I am somewhat able to hook up equipment ( electronics technician in the USAF , 20 years worth), so when I hooked up the cable between my pc and my tv, the tv turned off. Reset everything and tried again, same result, tv turned off. Since I had only had the tv one week I did not want to ruin it so I threw the cable away and quit trying."
2,really tiny lenght of audio cable,this cable is not at all good for the laptops which have audio in port and RGB port on opposite sides of the laptop otherwise the cable is fine
4,Nice product for the price,"Received the cables on time with 2 day shipping. Had one finger bend on me when I plugged it in, but not sure if it was already bent when I started. When I fixed it the finger broke about halfway down, but still works. Also, other fingers moved when I bent the first one back, so took a little time to get them all straight again. Haven't had a problem since then however."
5,Good!,Good product. The price was right and trhe quality was exceptional. I woiuld definetly buy this again. It was great!
2,heavy duty,"This cable is not for a laptop. This cable is so heavy, can they not make a smaller size in diameter."
5,This Rocks!,Really great for someone who wants a long connection. Have it plugged from my laptop to my tv in the bedroom so I can watch it in bed. LOVE IT!!!!
2,Caution: the audio cable was too short,"The audio cable was too short for me to plug into the audio jack while connecting the VGA port. I have two laptops, Dell Vostro 1520 and Thinkpad R61. It u happen to have one of those or similar ones, u probably have no luck for this product."
3,My heritage,"A necessary addition to my family history, of interest to anyone related to the Dunahay/Carrothers family line. Self-published by one of the Dunahays, it offers a long list of descendants from the union of Samuel Burdine Dunahay and Angel Carrothers. There are numerous errors, but it helped to fill out the genealogy chart I had created on ancestry.com."
3,Classic Shenandoah,"For anyone that likes Shenandoah, this is a good one to purchase. I was a little disappointed that ""Sunday In the South"" was not the original version with the harmonica. But, nevertheless, it's a must have."
3,A great book that depicts the universality of women's lives,"I read America's Dream over a year ago but America's story still sticks with me. As an American born citizen, I still could relate to her struggle with achieving independence in spite of all the forces that worked against her: her somewhat puzzling love for her husband in spite of his abuse; her tolerance of her mother's preoccupation with controlling her life; her struggle to influence her daughter in spite of a culture that deceives her into believing that she can gain independence through a relationship with a man. As a ""professional"" woman of color, I could even identify with her relationship with her employer. This is a fascinating story."
5,America's Dream,"America's dream is a really good book that reminds me of what some mothers go through when the father of their child abuses them and has a wife already. America goes through alot when she's in Vieques and working in a hotel La Casa del Fances. She has an achoholic mother, Ester and a rebelious and misunderstood daughter, Rosalind. She also has a abusive boyfriend, Correa, who has a wife and kids and promises America that they will get married and have a wonderful life. America meets a married couple with two small children and they ask her to babysit the kids while they go out. She does it without knowing that this couple and two children that will change her life dramatically."
3,"Realistic, but not a masterpiece..","It's a realistic book, the difficulties America faced are all told exquisitely. It's the story of a Puerto Rican woman who has a daughter and is in relationship with a 'weird' guy. She moves to NYC to escape him but still she's in fear that he will find her one day. Easy to read, but not a masterpiece. The fact that it's REALISTIC is its biggest plus. --"
4,DIY Kevlar Canoe... and it is so easy,"I was in the market to purchase a kevlar canoe when I stumbled across this book. This book does such a good job of explaining how to build your own Kevlar canoe, that I gave up the search for a new one and decided to build my own. This book lets the reader know that with some very simple techniques, almost anyone can build a Kevlar canoe. I am currently in the middle of my project and I have been very happy with the level of detail provided in this book."
3,Interesting book but method is not for me,"This is an interesting book. I liked reading about how to make a male mold. It definitely is for builders who want a light boat and are not really concerned with looks. I am not sure that the costs are as low as the author writes though so shop around carefully for Kevlar because this is very expensive material. Check to make sure that you are not sacrificing a few pounds for hundred of dollars more in materials. Glued lapstrake plywood building and cedar strip can be very light, beautiful looking boats too at fairly low costs if you build yourself. Make sure you check out all options.After reading the book, I realized this method of building would be too expensive for me (due to Kevlar costs)."
3,Needs more info on canoe designs in the book,"The book does seem to have enough information on the kevlar process to build a canoe, but it needs more detail on the three ""foolproof"" designs included in the book. Additional information on each design, along with some pictures, would be very helpful before you spend a lot of time and money building the wrong canoe for your needs. I have built redwood strip canoes, and am looking at this material for a future build due to it's light weight."
3,half price of competition but still overpriced for quality of item,"This motor was half the price of the other ones I found online. Even then I felt it was a lot to ask for a motor that would only be used a few times a year.The construction quality was really poor. I went to attach the motor and noticed a rattling inside the housing. I thought it was an extra screw that had fallen in during assembly. When I took the housing apart I found it was TWO of the four motor mount screws that had come loose.Put it all back together and tested it. Two speed switch gives low speed consistently. On high speed mode it jumps between low and high speed unless you hold the button down. Bad switch quality.I'm sending this back for a replacement. Hopefully the next one won't be a clunker.Update:I got the replacement unit yesterday. Switch works, no rattle in the motor. Wife has a smile on her face. As long as it doesn't wear out quickly I'm happy so I'll add another star."
2,pasta machine motor,I' m sorry but not pleased with this motor. I have an old one that sounded much better than this one. This one has a high pitch sound to the motor and runs fast even on the slow setting. It's not what I was expecting the older modle was much softer and runs slower. I think I was sold a referbished pasta machine.
4,analyses the traditional roles of women,"Morgan delves into 19th century Canada, and the roles of women within that society. We see the interplay of patriotism, loyalty and gender. Where the female expressions of patriotism were interpreted as natural extensions of domestic female roles. But the twist being that here the women were expressing themselves in a public arena, by publicly making efforts of patriotism.Then there were the traditional warnings about virtuous (ie. middle and upper class women) being seduced by rogues. This is basically unchanged from the attitude prevalent in Britain and the rest of Europe at the time."
2,Problematic Analysis,"Frederic Jameson has established himself as one of the leading interpreters of 'Post modernism' over the years, but in this work he turns his attention to a history of the modern. By outlining the variegated meanings and understanding's of the modern, from the Cartesian Cogito, to Marx's Capital, Jameson attempts to reach a coherent and comprehensive understanding of the period itself. However, Jameson falls into web of philosophical and ideological narratives from which he cannot remove himself. Aside from some insightful criticism's of Foucault's 'Episteme,' this work is a confused and superficial work of historiography."
4,insightful and inspiring,"I've read many books on children of alcoholics. Don't be fooled by my four stars--I'm a harsh critic. In the various readings I've done, Dr. Ackerman combines the best of it all in his book--you'll find profiles of daughters so you can identify your own daughter role, descriptions of the holistic process of recovery, and inspiring words. My favorite tidbit in his book is the poem which begins, ""After a while you learn the subtle difference between holding a hand and chaining a soul."" If you're in the early stages of coping with the alcoholism of a parent, this book is for you! Although I am much younger than she, I recently mailed this book to my older sister. She is finally ready to come to terms with the disease and to let go of some of her anger. Mothers, it can be a wonderful gift to your daughters! I received it from my mother, and I've passed it on. Does ""pass it on"" sound familiar? Let the healing begin!"
5,not my favorite,had a hard time getting through it. maybe i'll start it again. and maybe not. guess i wasn't as interested as i thought.
5,GREAT BOOK FOR RECOVERING YOURSELF,Has your husband tried to kill you? Has he locked you in the basement? Has he cheated on you multiple times with multiple women? Is he on drugs? Have you overlooked many of his bad repetitive behaviors or made multiple excuses to yourself? This is a great book for recovering yourself and explains why you chose such a scum bag and why you could not see what others could clearly see.
3,Running Out of Steam,"This disc is proof that state-of-the-art technology and ill-advised vocal tunes do not guarantee a great disc even from such high-calibre musicians as Weather Report.The opening ""Can It Be Done"" was a horrid idea at best, with extremely corny lyrics, anemic music and all manner of good intentions gone to hell. Worse yet, it did NOTHING to help WR's album sales anyway.However, tracks like ""Db Waltz"" fare far better as does most of the album. Far from essential, but has some worthwhile moments, just skip track 1 altogether."
3,In the Realm of Technology,"The February 1984 release has Joe Zawinul in the ""computer world"" that is driving pop music, with the use of electronic percussion machines and a digital keyboard sampler.There are four studio and three live selections, with the funk of Predator leading the way. The technological explorations come together in the title cut, as a LM-1 drum machine with overdubs by Omar Hakim provide an intriguing soundscape, with The Peasant being the venue for Zawinul to work with an E-MU Emulator.Zawinul is pushing forward with studio innovations that has mixed results and is close to being a solo effort. The computer world pushes Wayne Shorter to a more supporting role, with Victor Bailey and Jose Rossy like setup pitchers in baseball - who are a bridge between the starter and closer - important, but mostly forgettable when one glances at the box scores."
4,wonderful addition to the collection,"This album is phenomenal. My husband is a producer and he's been talking about this album for years. I'm not sure of his name, but one of the members of this band passed away recently and it happened to be on the same day my husband's mother passed. This album was on his heart so I purchased it for him. His favorite song is ""Can It Be Done?"". But really, the whole album is phenomenal. It's a wonderful addition to any CD collection."
5,Forgiveness and Jesus: The Meeting Place of A Course In Miracle and Christianity,"A Wonderful must read book for all on your Journey through A Course In Miracles. My life has changed so much since I started the course. The biggest change is in my thoughts and learning how to listen to our ""my"" self! No easy task but oh so worth it! I have read many many books on the course and recently added this to my library with no regrets of course! Kenneth Wapnick has a wonderful collection for those on the course looking for certain details of your journey take a look you won't regret it!"
5,Excellet!,"This is one of the best B. F. Skinner's books! I really recommend! In it, Skinner discusses philosophical issues and does analysis of contemporary world, always focusing on the behaviour! It is a very very good book! I recommend it!"
2,This anthology contains a sequel to Walden Two!,"Few people seem to be aware that B.F. Skinner Wrote a sequel to Walden Two. It's called, ""News From Nowhere, 1984,"" and it's in this anthology. It tells how George Orwell fakes his death and then lives out the rest of his days at Walden Two with Frasier, Burris, the pie lady and crew. Notable in this story is that Skinner (via Frasier) explicitly identifies his ideology as anarchist. I'm sure Chomsky would disagree (not to mention Zerzan.)"
2,Bring back the old Kevin,"The sixth book in the series does not do justice to the first three in the series. (There was a noticable change in the fourth book.) The edge is gone along with Kevin's limp. A character that demonstrated such an interesting edge and insight has been regulated to cliche's and a boring plot. There is too much emphasis on Kevin's son and his struggle with the injustices of life, both perceived and real. If the author wants to write about Clayton, then let him create a spin off series, and return Kevin to the original character that he was, for he has become a dull read."
4,Another good Southwestern writer...,"I had previously read ""The Judas Judge"" by McGarrity and although I liked it well enough, I found myself straining a little at the plot. ""Under the Color of Law"" had a fairly incredulous plot but this time, I didn't feel like I strained so much. Go figure. McGarrity fills his books with a precise and loving characterization of the Southwest and for those elements of his plots, anyone who has never been to the Southwest may readily believe them. This story was interesting and complex and not a little paranoid about the shadowy figures who hold great power in these United States, but it was a fun read and I look forward to his next book in this series."
5,UCOL,"Again McGarrity has another spell-binder that was very hard to put down. His knowledge of the southwest is great and so far accurate as I lived in El Paso for 25 years, and know the areas he refers to in his books."
5,Another great Kevin Kerney,"Another gripping Kevin Kerney. The way it ended, I think some of this will reappear at a later date. A real page turner."
2,Black Helicopters,"Michael McGarrity's name showed up in an article about ""mystery writers."" I ordered books by 4 different authors. I doubt I'll do that again...I'll stick to the Prey series and Coben.While I enjoyed the trials and tribulations of the main character, I did NOT for one second enjoy/believe the government conspiracy aspect of the book. Sorry, Mr. McGarrity...but no more of you !"
3,Is McGarrity trying to be a poor man's Ludlum?,"I have enjoyed all of the author's novels and anticipated reading this one. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to the previous works. In the 1980's and 90's many authors, such as Ludlum, Maclean, Grisham et al, became wrapped up in conspiracy novels - nothing is what it seems and the big bad institution (i.e. business, government, the mob) has its fingers everywhere. Mr. McGarrity's latest offering suffers from this malaise. His previous novels were better when he concentrated on real people with evil, but concretely realistic, motivations. Without revealing the ending in this book, his earlier works left you with a sense that evil had been bested. Here, I was left with a sour taste in my gut."
2,Poorly advertised.,This book was received without a cover. This was not advertised. I do not keep books in my library without a cover. I have since replaced this with a book that has a cover. This book will be donated to charity.
2,Rothco not the best quality?,"I really liked the jacket, but in the end had to send it back. Zipper on the arm pocket was nearly unusable and the main zipper not much better. But the clincher was that the quilting inside around the armholes was coming apart. I have *never* had this happen on a new jacket. Not sure if mine was just a fluke or if it's characteristic of Rothco. (did see a couple reviews of their MA1 where the pocket snaps were coming off, so maybe it is too common for their jackets)"
2,Vangelis is the greatest composer of the 20th century,"Vangelis is the greatest composer of the 20th century, but Beauborg is one of his LEAST ACCESSIBLE albums - if you're looking for typical Vangelisian romantic melodies, lush orchestration, and/or amazing special effects, choose a different album. If Beethoven and/or Mozart were alive today, they would often be found kneeling before the altar in a shrine they had erected in Vangelis' honour. Vangelis' music transcends the barriers of time and space, it is cosmic and universal - His music is immediately spiritual without being dogmatic in any way. It evokes profoundly elemental visual imagery and allows the listener to access ancient primeval, chthonic memory sources."
1,trash,"I bought this album many years ago. As a poor musician myself, I often play bits of this album to my friends to let them see for themselves how bad some one can be, yet still get published. I love synths, but this is me on a really bad day. Don't waste your money!"
1,Junk - a waste of money !,"Definitely an experimental load of garbage. This is NOT music (I don't care how 'artistic' it may seem). I can't believe that something like this could be puplished! Worse still- people buy it! Oh - I bought the CD in error *he says, sheepishliy* - it is now used as a coaster..."
1,Is this masterpiece?,"Is this a masterpiece? Oh, probably it is to some genius ear and mind, but certanly not to me. It is ugly masterpiece. I don't care what you other ppl say 'cause I have this album at home and right now I'm listening to it. It's horrible. There is not even a ""M"" from any kind of melody, just a lot of very irritating synth sound. I agree that this album is not for 0 stars, but it certanly does not deserves more than 1 star. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage. If you wanna hear really great Vangelis albums then buy this: ""Conquest of Paradise"", ""Dragon"", ""Opera Sauvage"", ""Apocalypse Des Animaux"", ""Direct"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Voices"", ""Oceanic"", ""Antarctica"", ""Albedo""...this are all great albums for start. But if you really want to buy ""Beaubourg""(whatever that word means) then don't buy it until you have all other Vangelis albums."
2,Very experimental.,"I was a Vangelis completist when I came across the disc in a used compact disc store. Beauborg doesn't have many, if any melodies per se, rather it is an experimental cd for the most part. Vangelis seems to be conducting a sound check session here as he fiddles with alternating sound balances and different sound effects. This 1975 release shows some of Vangelis' talents, but it's not in a musically enjoyable format. Some of the experimental melodies played here showed up in later albums."
2,FEW USES,This product does not go with most of my pie pans. The idea is good but good old fashion foil works just as good.
5,Bow case,"This is an excellent case. I thought it might be too big, compared with my plano protecter case I had. But after seeing it now, it's not much bigger. Its actually shorter, and I love the features it has. I especially love the storage room it has. I can now carry all my bow accessories in one case with my bow."
4,Good bow case,"This case gives you great protection, a place to put everything and at a great price.The only problem you might have is you can't take bow on plane trip because hinges are not metal nor are lock holes. It is also very large but you can't have it both ways. I would rather have extra room than not enough."
5,practical bow hunter storage tool,"my son and i needed a simple storage and protection tool for our new bows.the plano bow-max xt case is very well designed and built.the bow hold down, arrow storage and tool storage are great.the only down side was that they only included one tool case as it has space for two.i have been looking for 9x7x2 inch cases in stores to have more tool storage.definetely a good value at the $45 price we got from amazon.ben and kyle kc"
5,Plano Bow-Max XT Single Bow Case,"Heck, for the price, you just can't beat this thing. Yes, it's big, but that isn't always a bad thing. It's a nice sturdy case that'll protect your investment. I'm able to put all the stuff I might actually NEED in one place now."
3,A little flimsy,"This was the only case I found that would fit my Z7 bow. The case is less rigid than what might be desired and nesting the halves to close it properly takes some efffort. Because of it's length, it sticks out past the fenders when being transported on my ATV. As a result it gets hit with mud and water when driving. While it does a fairly good job of protecting the bow, I've actually had water get inside the case. I've been toying with the idea of putting some sort of foam tape weatherstripping in the mating surfaces to make it seal better."
3,"Ok, but too flimsy and I can't store my quiver securely.","While this is a large bow case, I'm not able to stow my bow with the quiver attached due to the center case supports. The bottom storage area is also not wide enough to store the quiver, so I'm forced to allow it to be unsecured in the case. The handle is too flimsy which allows the two halves to separate when carrying it. I had to wrap a velcro strap around it for transport. The case is ok otherwise."
4,"Nice, great protection, huge","This case is grea, really well built, fits a mathews reezen perfectly, it's outside dimensions are just a little big"
5,Excellent bow case!!!,"This is the best bow case I have seen for the money. It is no SKB but I didn't want to pay $200 plus, either. Lots of room, I have a removable quiver that fits perfectly in the lower compartment. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Snug fit for my Mathews SB with 2 piece quiver,"The case came quickly and in it's original packaging. There are a few screws to put in to custom mount the bow straps that hold your bow in place. I like the quality and there's plenty of storage space, but it doesn't fit my bow set up very well. I bought this for my Mathews Switchback with a 2 piece quiver. The upper quiver piece sits right on the support pillar, which forces me to put the cam right on the edge of the case. I like the concept, but wish they had put the support pillars closer together."
4,Good case for the price.,I got this case for my bow. Its not a bad case for the price. I wish the container that came with it had dividers in it to keep stuff separate but no big deal. I took one star away because the box it came in showed one of these under a truck tire holding the weight. I don't think it will but OK. I'm not trying it with mine. The case is nice with a spot to hold 12 extra arrows which is nice. I will buy this product again.
4,Reasonable bow case,"This case is a good purchase for the price. Be aware the small box they send with case does not fit in archery case with a true parallel limb bow, as the limbs block the slot intended for the small box. Case it what I needed for transporting bow to hunting without damaging bow."
5,Great for plenty of storage (If size isn't and issue),If size is not an issue this is a really good case. If your bow has parallel limbs be sure to make sure it will fit inside the available space. I didn't and ended up trimming the inside ribs in two places (just a very little). I carry a lot of extra stuff and went the extra mile an bought a second storage case (there's space for two). I can't imagine a better case for the price.
3,"Pretty Good, but not Great","I think this is a good case for the value, however it is a bit flimsier than what I was looking for. The edges to not line up perfectly or seal in any way, and presumably dust or dirt could get in these gaps, although this has not actually happened. I am not super serious about archery, so it works for me."
2,Not as good as it looks.,"I purchased a plano bow case four years ago and still have that case today, I would not trade it for anything in the world, It stands upright and opens from the top, extreamly strong, This case is flemsy as you know what, I am so dissapointed in this case. It is hard to get closed right and latched. It is a lot larger than my old case, Man I would give anything if I could get ahold of the old style case. I feel the engineers at Plano realy laid an egg on this one, and by the way this case would crush under the weight of a stroller. YOur Bow would'nt stand a chance. The product did ship quickly Gary S. New Mexico"
4,Too big for the money,"Good quality and professional looking case is simply too big for one bow. I need a case for my son and was confused by 'single bow case' in the product name. The case in really huge, check actual size twice not to make the same mistake! It will fit bow, arrows and much more if you are willing to handle single case for all your stuff."
4,Mathews Reezen,I needed this case to fit the parallel limb design of my Mathews Reezen. It has plenty of room for other stuff and mine came with the broadhead tool box all at a great price.
4,Excellent!,Fascinating read from beginning to end. Morris should know because he covered Clinton from the beginning. Well researched and organized. I might have given it 5 stars except that the reader is not 100% sure of how much of the book may have been colored to Morris's personal opinion.
2,Why did he write this? Because he could.,I had the CD version of this. Most of it is like listening to someone gripe about a former boss. Seems odd given that Morris would not be rich and famous if not for BC. There are a few good observations. The Bill & Hillary part is probably the best.
3,The grittiness of politics,"When reading a book by Dick Morris, I'm mindful of his moral lapses as well as his role in the Clinton legacy. The book illuminates the complicated personalities of both Clintons and is well worth reading to those interested in the behind-the-scenes grittiness of politics."
2,Between the lines,"The style is smart and at times engaging, but between the lines you can tell this guy is plain jelous of his ex boss, obviously he lacks everything that makes the other so charismatic. He resents that he did not receive the recognition HE thinks he should have received. It is the ex wife ranting about his ex, who left her for another. I suspect he has a man crush on Bill."
1,Another leachfest from incompetent Morris,"Ah, a quickie book devoid of useful analysis, that opportunistically leaches on the success of Clinton's autobiography. Doesn't that encapsulate a microcosm of Morris himself? Bereft of any actual accomplishment within the last 10 years, and having seen his career demolished by his own incompetence and moral decadence, Morris has no choice but to leach onto the accomplishments of others.Sadly, taking notice of the quickly sinking sales numbers of this book only days after publication, it would appear that Morris, unlike Clinton, is no comeback kid."
2,"Dick Morris knows more about Exit polls , than Clinton,","""Exit polls are almost never wrong... according to ABC-TV's exit polls, for example, Kerry was slated to carry Florida, Ohio, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada and Iowa....To screw up one exit poll is unheard of. To miss six of them is incredible. It boggles the imagination how pollsters could be that incompetent and invites speculation that more than honest error was at play here."" - Dick Morris. According to Mr. Morris polls so reliable they are used by the USA to guard against election fraud in other countries. The polls were right- investigate the E-Vote- WHO counted our votes? Does Dick Morris know?"
1,Oh Please,Umm lets see it's about Bill cheating and his wife and so on and it's written by a man who cheated on his wife in the same way as Bill. Many other presidents have done many worse things than anything mentioned in this book. At least Bill's issues didn't kill anyone.!!!!
1,Re-Hash of Old News,"This book is simply a re-hash of everything we have already heard. There is nothing new or informative in this book, other than a new way to make money for the author. It's simply a waste of time, and is not at all interesting whatsoever.Mind you this is a book review, not a political commentary."
1,Unbelievably Disappointing,"I hate to start a book and not finish it, no matter how bad it is. After taking a quick glance at this book, I was expecting a, dare I say it, fair and balanced analysis of the Clinton administration and an intelligent discussion of its many facets (both good and bad) and the events that took placed during its eight year reign from someone who was clearly in the know.Unfortunately, what I found was a shameless piece of self-promotion and unmistakeable Monday morning quarterbacking.From the very beginning, this book screams of the writer's supreme sense of self-importance. His hindsight analysis of the entire tenure of the Clinton administration is unbelievably convenient and self-serving.Don't waste your time or money. It isn't even interesting. It's just bad."
1,Disgruntled Employee?,Morris (a married man) got fired in light of his affair with some prostitute. This was the man in charge of constructing the family values part of Clinton's campaign. Oh Bill . . . why can't you come back to Washington?
1,Don't Buy It,"This book is simply a re-hash of everything we have already heard.There is nothing new or informative in this book, other than a new way to make money for the author. It's simply a waste of time, and is not at all interesting whatsoever.Mind you this is a book review, not a political commentary."
3,Darker than expected...,"OPI is my favorite brand of nail polish, and I am really into the metallic colors right now. I bought this thinking it would give me a nice metallic plum finish, but its really more of a crimson color with no hint of glistening. I guess that's what I get for trying a new color based on one picture..."
5,Paid for itself in less than a month,"I was paying almost $5 at Starbucks for Vanilla Lattes, now I can make them at home, and they taste practically the same! I only had a problem once with steaming the milk, and that was my fault - not enough steam left for frothing. You have to remember how much water you put in, and keep an eye on the carafe to determine when to steam the milk. I bought vanilla syrup from Starbucks, and voila - perfect vanilla lattes. I'm thrilled with the machine and have been making one or two lattes a day for two weeks. The machine is holding up great. Now I just need to get more syrup flavors, and I'll be my very own barista!"
1,"CHEAP PRICED, CHEAP QUALITY","I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BROKEN, BUT THE MACHINE DOES NOT STEAM THE MILK AT ALL. IT ONLY GIVES ME A FEW SECINDS OF STEAM BEFORE STOOPING. I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS, BUT STILL NOTHING. THE THE REST IS OK I GUESS, JUST THE STEAM. I EXPECTED MORE."
1,A bad buy,"I bought this espresso/cappuccino maker to make coffee for my husband, but to my dismay, the milk frothing system failed on the first machine I bought, so I had to return it. Strangely enough, it failed again the second time. After calling the customer support line for Mr. Coffee, I found out there was an error in the instructions provided with the machine, and that I was needing to add more water to create more steam pressure. Sure enough, they were right. But now, a month down the road, the frothing system again fails to function, even using the new recommended procedure. I suppose you get what you pay for, but you're really better off avoiding the frustration this machine will bring you."
3,it's ok,"Thought I would love it based on reviews, but only kinda like it. Wouldn't buy it again if it was broke or stolen."
1,Can we put negative signs in front of the stars?,"This book was really really amusing... if you like reading psychobabble. If we could put negative signs in front of the stars, this baby would have -5 stars."
5,All picnic baskets need one,All picnic baskets should come with one of these. I purchased a few for the Pasadena Pop's concert picnic. It is a great size! It is sturdy and easy to use! It is the perfect height for people sitting on a blanket or beach chair.
3,It is okay,This table is probably great for sand but not so much for any other soil. It should have a metal tip so it can be used in more soil types. Also the first one came broken where the cut outs are to hold the wine glass which make me think that is a weak point in the table and might not last a long time.
3,bamboo table,"Received promptly. There was a crack in one end close to the wine glass slot, which I re-glued, then shaved off about a sixteenth of an inch at the slot, so my wine glass stems would fit through. Now it works fine! Wish it were bigger, to hold more stuff. I use a gripper pad under my dishes-the bamboo top is very smooth and slippery, and that keeps things from sliding off."
4,Picnic- Wine Holder,Have not had an oportunity to use this item however it seems very sturdy and the stake is appropriately long. Will surely do a good job!
3,Great idea but...,I love this item because I take it with me to napa for picnics with my wife. What I don't like is that the link between the stake and the table isn't sturdy so I struggle to get it into the ground without breaking it. Once in it's great and lends itself to romantic closeness.
4,Good but could be better,"I purchased this along with a picnic bag and bottle holders so I am well equipped to sit on the lawns at a concert. This table would be better if it had two prongs rather than one and maybe a little thinner, like the metal bottle holders. I have to be careful when pushing it into the ground that I don't break it as the stick is fairly thick, in addition if I place something on one end rather than the middle it tips over a little and stuff slides off. It comes in a plastic drawstring bag making it easy to pack up and carry."
4,Handy wine table,"This little table is easy to tote around, comes in a convenient carrying bag and is very durable. My one complaint is that the spike that goes into the ground isn't very long so really long stemmed glasses are awkward to use with it."
4,Wide variety of detailed and appealing animals,"This oversized book presents many beautiful charted designs of animals set in their habitats. I particularly liked the animal alphabet and animal numerals, as well as the idea of joining several squares featuring animals such as otters and trout and quail into a carpet (though I would use it with her ivy border as a wall hanging - no way is it going on the floor!).The only odd thing was the decision to scatter photographic collage pictures throughout the book. I didn't find them particularly appealing and wasn't sure why they were included except that Elizabeth had fun making them and wanted them in the book.For those who want to do needlework animals in a classic, realistic style rather than a cutesy or country style, this book includes many appealing projects."
4,the title track might throw you,"This really is a great Shorter record, but sometimes I play this record for people and they just don't get the title track. It must be the augmented chords...if you want to check this out I might suggest saving the title track for last. Yes or No is a classic. Deluge and Mahjongg are beautiful. I'd put this second or third in the Shorter catalog (1 and 2 being Speak No Evil and Night Dreamer)."
3,An indication of great things to come,"more than a masterpiece itself. I find many of Shorter's solos a bit tenuous on this recording, but it is still very compelling music and better than the average. But do get the remastered version. Without exception, I have found all the RVG remasterings to be vastly superior to the originals on any mid- to high-level equipment. There is no lack of warmth and the sound is firmed up all around."
2,Derivative of Coltrane--Shorter in limbo,"Derivative of Coltrane without that master's confidence, this is quickly dull listening, being repetitive and far too careful. Additionally, the fade-aways I find to be cheating. Certainly Shorter is finding himself here, but the uncertainty of direction is clear. Missing the fire of his work and compositions with Blakey, and certainly not near the artistic integrity of Adam's Apple. A Shorter fan, this is nevertheless a disappointment."
4,Coltrane or Wayne?,"""JuJu"" is a great album, but I believe the use of Coltrane's rhythm section pigeonholes Wayne as a Coltane immitator, which he is not. If you love Wayne, invest in this album. If you're just starting to listen to him, I recommend ""Speak No Evil"" or even ""The All Seeing Eye"" for the more avante-garde listener."
2,"Great Album, Surprisingly bad sound quality","This album is great, classic Wayne Shorter stuff. I'm writing this review because unfortunately the digital remastering is surprisingly poor. Usually you can count on a RVG remaster to be excellent, but with this one, there's a noticeable crack-up or buzz in the EQ of Shorter's saxophone that makes listening to this album on headphones somewhat torturous."
5,American Made!!!,"I had previously purchased one of these fans some time ago, before purchasing the second. When looking for something to last, the details make the difference. Ball bearings in this fan motor versus a sleeve bearing in most others. It may be more appropriate to write this review when this fan finally wears out.American made and built to last"
4,Long Live the (Air) King,"Bought this 14"" fan to get air circulating in a crawlspace, so size was a major consideration. This is a well-made fan and is reasonably quiet but the motor is not as strong as the next size up 18"" fan, although the price is almost the same. Had I not needed the smaller size I think the 18"" version is the better value and is probably more of a true high velocity fan. This one is quiet enough to use as a room fan and can fit on a table if necessary. The smaller size makes it easier to store as well."
5,"The Air KIng 14"" High Velosity Fan","The reason I made this purchase is I needed a floorfan I could throw in the window to ventilate the house on milder days. I also wanted a fan made here in America. The fan performs its job effectively and has a totally enclosed ball bearing motor. Because of this motor you can operate this fan in dirty environments without concern, and with ball bearings this fan will probably last 20 years or more with seasonal usage.I would highly recommend this fan to anybody."
5,Air King 14 Inch Fan,"I looked hard to find a replacement for my old Cinni Fan, and bought this Air King because of other reviewers comments---that it was the only good, durable, quality Made in America product available. It has met all my concerns---powerful, well made, and quiet enough at the lowest speeds to use in the kitchen, dining and family areas of my house! I have had no need yet for the highest speed. Buy it! You will like it!"
4,Excellent Product,"First AirKing 14 inch arrived damaged due to poor packaging and rough handling, I followed the return instructions and the second AirKing 14 showed up just fine. The build quality and sturdiness of the fan is very good. Since I needed two fans, for intake and exhaust, I bought the AirKing 14 and a similar model from Lowe's with internal oscillation feature. Both fans are heavy duty, the airking is slightly less noisy and pushes just as much air. The real difference is going to be in the longevity of the products. The AirKing 14 has the fully sealed motor vs the open cooled design of the forign made Utilitech model. My girlfriend says she likes the Airking 14 better then the other fan because it is quieter and the dog can lay in front of it without being blown away. In my opinion, both fans work fine, if you want to save some bread, get the Lowe's model. If the internal sealed motor, and American made construction make a difference to you then go with the AirKing 14."
2,moves air but is much louder than it's specs,"I bought this one because it is made in the USA (except for the motor, unfortunately). It was specified to be quiet (48/55/58 dB low/med/high) and I thought it would be great (my old USA-made Patton measures 55/71/72 and is very quiet on low speed but LOUD on medium and high). But the Air King 9214 that I received sounded even louder than my Patton, especially on low speed, so I measured it and it is actually 68/76/75. It's going back."
4,Expensive quality,"The Air King was bought to replace a similar model Patton that only lasted about four years. The frame and guard are of equal quality, but the motor is definitely better on the Air King, and that is what has gone bad on both Pattons I have owned. Only time will tell if the increased cost will be worth it."
3,A Utilitarian Dystopia,"What would the world be like if the utilitarians had their way? Pretty bad, according to Huxley's *Brave New World*, and James Gunn agrees. Or rather, pretty bad if it's the Benthamite utilitarians (who get the Earth and self-destruct), but apparently not badly at all if it's the Millian utilitarians (who escape to Venus)."
3,Nothing special.,"This is nothing special and as seems to be the case with Frank Butler on the Contemporary dates, his cymbals are under recorded. Get the 1958 Vancouver radio broadcast by Harold with Elmo Hope, Scott LaFaro, Lenny McBrowne. That is great Harold Land, not this."
3,No Directions Necessary,"Definitely not one of Ms. Rendell's better efforts in the Inspector Wexford series. While the basic plot is intricate and clever, the mystery tends to get bogged down with painfully detailed descriptions of travel around London and its suburbs via public conveyances and automobiles; if I had wanted travel directions, I would have purchased a road map from the Automobile Association of Britain and some public transit schedules from the LTC. Still, second-rate Ruth Rendell is better than no Ruth Rendell at all."
3,Poor Kindle Version,"This was my first Ruth Rendell novel. I was enjoying the book, or at least trying to, but the numerous typos made it impossible. The story started off well, I was really enjoying Wexford as a character, but the sheer amount of typos in this book was distracting to the point where I just gave up. I am a prolific reader and it is very hard for me to not finish a book, I rarely do it, even if the book is bad, but I couldn't even concentrate on the content. It became a chore, and reading should NEVER be a chore. So I gave up. I've read many books on my Kindle and never had this problem before and hopefully won't again. I plan on picking the book up in paper back just so I can finish the story, but shame on whoever is responsilbe for this jumbled mess."
3,MURDER IN THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE,Beautifully plotted and written with a lot of local color. The author's characters and descriptions put the reader into the story.
1,Not what I expected.,"By the title of the book you would think that this would be a tell-all book by a supposed womanizer, right? Wrong! This book is random experiences that the author has had with different women during his womanizing. This is nothing more than a collection of cluttered confusion. There is no chronological order for the dates and times that are listed on the pages. This is not in a memoir format but just the author's random thoughts that have no rhyme or reason. Personally, I could not get past page ten of this novel. I have a confession myself: I wish I never even picked up this book."
1,Terrible,"This is, quite simply, the most overwrought and overstated prose I've ever had the distinct displeasure of reading. Prose like this takes all of the eroticism and, let's face it, fun, out of sex."
1,Save your money - worst book I couldn't read,"If I could enter a -100 rating I would. This was the dumbest book I've ever tried to read. Couldn't get into it to save my life, I tried about five times, still no luck. It was totally incoherent, what was the publisher thinking? Made a great fire starter however."
4,Great Book!,I really enjoyed the book. I thought it to be very insightful and well written. I am not a big fan of womanizers but i kinda feel your pain. I guess that you guys do go through some though trials. I still feel that maybe guys that have commitment issues should get counseling and stop putting the burdan on women that just want to love you.
2,Put me to sleep,It seems very eloquently written and I thought I would enjoy it but I read the first 10 pages and it put me to sleep.
1,This book HAD TO BE self-published!,"Oh, my God what a horribly written book! I have no problem with the subject - it's the lack of organization of the journal entries (not in an 'artsy' way either)and the prose (a nauseating mix up of Shakespeare-ish and cheap romance novel-ish). I could not get past the fifth page. I even tried that reliable old trick of going to the end - that was even worse!"
2,Not good for outdoors and unrealistic,"Large transformer is hard to plug in and gets very hot is clearly not good for outdoor use, and some boxes are marked as not for outdoors although the web site claims this product can be used outdoors. Also, looks quite unrealistic. Not as good as other light up grapes I have purchased in the past."
4,Great PHP book that dabbles in all areas of PHP,"For those that want to learn how to do all aspects of web development using PHP, this book for you. As co-author and technical reviewer or 3/4 of the book, I can say from experience that this book does indead cover everything you'll need to know when making dynamic websites.This book is great for beginners as well as professionals since the introduction material can offer a good beginning to learning PHP and some of the later chapters on Internationalization, databases, xml, optimization, etc. will be suitable for experts.I wish the book contained more object oriented examples and that some chapters contained more depth, but for a book of 960 pages, it certainly covers a lot of material.If you are starting to learn PHP and want to expand your skills or are an expert and want some more indepth material, add this book to your collection!"
2,Not impressed: they don't know who their audience is,"In reading this book, it's clear to me that the authors don't have a clear focus on who their audience is supposed to be and what they are trying to accomplish.They sprinkle the book with trivial examples that don't give any ""meat"", concentrate on the details of what low-level functions are available, and gloss over completely how to make the best use of the features.This book contains a lot of information, but it is not organized to get an experienced developer up to speed on a new language, nor is it geared towards a beginning programmer who might need basic concepts explained.I don't know who would find this book at the ""right level"", but I wish I hadn't spent my money on it. I've gotten more out of the website than I got out of this book."
5,Excellent PHP resource,I bought this book based on the reviews i read here on amazon.I had learnt the PHP language from Beginning PHP4 by the publisher.I have now read this book from front to back and i must admit that i have gained professional knowledge on diversified PHP topics.It has already helped me at my day job in streaming my project forward in the last week or so -- I truly felt i had gained a notch above the Beginning PHP Programmer. This book is a must read for anyone who has basic mark-up and c-like programming skills.
3,Too many cooks spoil the broth,There are a lot of good concepts here but many of them are poorly explained. This book has about a dozen authors and you never are able to settle down and feel comfortable with the way any of the chapters are written. Check out Programming PHP as an alternate.
5,A deftly amusing celebration of a widely beloved hobby and the people who embrace it,"Garden Lunacy: A Growing Concern is an utterly irreverent gardening book. Not intended as an instructional about raising plants or gardens (though the astute reader will acquire many tips on what not to do!), Garden Lunacy offers sharp-tongued wit and humor about the unique manner in which gardeners see the universe: plants first, humans last. Eccentric, covetous, even compulsive gardener traits are explored with a wink and a smile, sure to sound a sympathetic chuckle in plant lovers everywhere. A deftly amusing celebration of a widely beloved hobby and the people who embrace it."
1,no stars I prefer to listen to a fart for 58 minutes,There is one good song on the CD then the rest just drives me crazy and I want to pull my hair out like LanP.
2,Fun at the time; way out of date now.,"A review of fun places to visit in Floridaduring 1982. Since it was written before theUniform Drinking Age Act, there is a largeemphasis on alcohol. Also a discussion on""How to Get Lucky"" and how to eat raw oysters.Prices have changed quite a bit since then."
1,Beware,"The one star rating is for the DVD product (November 2010 release with new artwork and Amray style case), not the film. Despite what it says on the back of the DVD case, specifically, ""WIDESCREEN VERSION presented in a 'matted' widescreen format preserving the aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition. Enhanced for widescreen TVs."", the disc for this product contains only an unmatted 4:3 aspect ratio version of the film. This is a major step backward from the earlier Warner Brothers snapcase release."
5,Three of their funniest shorts.,"This stooge video has the shorts ""The Yoke's on Me"",""No Dough Boys"" and ""Higher Than A Kite.""All 3 are very funny but my favorite in this video is ""Higher Than A Kite.""After messing up in the motorpool, the stooges go into a sewerpipe to escape. Actually, it's not a sewerpipe at all.(That's what the stooges think). It's really a blockbuster bomb that is headed towards Germany!"
5,THREE OF THEIR FUNNIEST!!!,"These three shorts were my very first glimpse into the world of the Stooges. I laughed myself silly on all three of these, and I watched it almost every day I had it out of the video rental place. If you want to laugh, get these three!"
5,Glad to have it!!,"I was so happy to get this cd. Even though it is E-40's first cd, I needed to have it because of Captain Save a Hoe!! That is my jam and I wanted to have it on cd and not just on my Ipod. Thanks!!"
2,Not What E-40 Normally Does,"This Album Is not what I call a album First 4 trackz are the tightest with the tightest beats. Best track on here is ""I practice Looking Hard"" probably one of the best trackz he eva made in his whole career I love that song but otha than that ""Captain save a hoe"" and ""Mail Man"" are a discrace. He shouldnt have even made this cd until he got more trackz"
5,Essential for any serious researcher,I recommend this book for anyone interested in researching the origins of the Campbell Clan. It is a treasure trove of information.
4,jesses power trip,"I totally dissagree whit the other review written on this cd ,yes maybe it doesnt rock like you exspect it to , but it better than 1 star .The ballads on this cd arent that great ,but some of the songs are pretty rocking ,and yes they are great guitar playing on this cd ,with catchy riffs .Point in case heart to heart ,let it roll and hot wired have catchy riffs.They sound like a mix of night ranger , bond jovi ,and styx, if you could imagine such a cd . It not one of my favorites but i wish they would write another cd i think the potental is there .I hope this review was helpfull to you"
1,Terrible CD!,"Terrible songs, terrible singing, terrible guitar playing. No catchy melodies, harmonies, or hooks. Just because the keyboardist for Journey co-wrote ONE of the songs and has nothing else to do with the album doesn't mean someone should use a famous musician's name to sell a CD. Of course from a seller's point of view, using Jonathan Cain's name to sell this CD was technically fine since he DID co-write ONE of the songs. It certainly was a good way to get a customer's interest in the CD."
4,Very good starting point,"Professor Kline's book offers a very readable account on a rather confusing subject. The theory is explained clearly, plenty of examples are presented, and specially, there is a good deal of interpretation exercise. If you're also interested in principal components analysis, don't miss I. T. Jolliffe's book."
2,Very shallow and riddled with mistakes,"The author motivates his book by saying that there are no simple, non-mathematical texts on factor analysis, yet he constantly refers to other books on the subject, as opposed to setting the record straight.If I where to re-write this book, I would:1) use a statistical package to do the calculations for me,2) double check all of my formulae (there are mistakes screaming out at anybody who has done basic statistics before) and3) concentrate on breadth, as opposed to depth. The three key techniques in the book are principle components, exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Modern computer packages deal with technical issues such as rotation of factors, and mentioning 'R', 'Q' and 'T' rotations, whatever they are, was frankly irritating!"
5,It brought back memories,"I had never thought I would have been able to get this movie. My granddaughter really started this whole thing by always talking about the animated version. I told her about the movie I knew and one thing led to another and I got on Amazon and there it was. Then my granddaughter wanted the autobiography of the grand duchess. We have not watched that one yet, she is on vacation in California and when she comes home we will watch it. She loved MY version of Anastasia."
4,Ingrid Bergman in one of the finest performances of all time,"Ingrid Bergman (always highly magnetic) gives a haunting performance that must be considered one of the greatest in film history. Despite the commanding presence of Yul Brynner, she dwarfs him, and really everyone else in the film, excepting Helen Hays (who is also superb). Director Anatole Litvak's handling may be quaintly theatrical, and be a bit elegant for today's viewers; but the performances, dialogue, and ever tantalizing mystery (is she, or isn't she?) clutch the attention throughout. While this film may throw little light on history, it draws in its characters expertly, entertains solidly, and the choreography of individual scenes (particularly those between Bergman and Hays) is positively electric. A highly enjoyable and satisfying film!"
3,Better than not seeing it at all...,"This is one of those movie gems one rarely sees on TV anymore, so the only way to see it is to buy the DVD. The film restoration is wonderful, with brilliant colors, but as other reviewers have noted, the technicians totally forgot to work on the soundtrack. In fact, it's almost like they went out of their way to ruin it. The mix is bad -- sometimes the background music/theme track drowns out the dialogue, or the actors sound as if they were speaking their lines inside a 55-gal. drum (echo, tinny, etc.). Bass and treble seem out of whack. The audio listing notes it as ""Dolby 4.0,"" maybe that version was Dolby's only dud? I don't have a surround system with my TV, so I wondered if THAT was the problem; running the sound through an amp and 2 more speakers didn't help much.3 stars are only for the DVD; the film (plot, acting, etc.) deserves 5."
4,Anastasia,It starts out a little vague. About in the middle we all know what it's about. The actors picked for this picture are supburb. Yul Brenner is excellent in his role. I've watched this movie three times and each like it was the first time.
4,Thoroughly enjoyable!,The performances by Bergman and Brynner really escalate this film into greatness. I wish more people would see this. Its such a beautiful and subtle film.
4,RESTORATION AND EXTRAS MAKE IT GREAT..ER!!!!,It's already a great movie but the extras make it greater! Either before viewing or after watching the movie you have the chance to see the Biography channels story on the real Anastasia. I believe this gave me so much more satisfaction because I was able to learn and also to compare it to the fictional story that the movie was. I wont even waste space describing the actors performances except to say ..Magnificant!!!!
2,Informative but dry,"I bought this book hoping for a great book to teach my daughter about medieval cities. I found it to be very general in the descriptions and too dry for a 9 to 12 year old. My eleven year old stopped reading it within the first chapter and she is a history lover. There were many statements within the book without explanation. Such as, ""About half the children died before they reached the age of five."" No explanation or discussion about the diseases or dangers of the time that caused a high mortality rate instead on to ""most children spent their time in play."" If and when this book and its companions come out in paperback, at a much lower price, the series might be worth adding to your library."
4,long time,The book was in perfect condition it just took tooo long to get here. The seller waited 12 days before even mailing it!!!!
4,A solid start for these Vallejo MC's,"Many heads overlooked The Click's debut album ""Down & Dirty"", and didn't catch on to these dope cats until they dropped ""Game Related"". If you are one of those people who still haven't picked up ""Down & Dirty"", this is your wake up call! Produced mostly by Studio Tone, Mike Mosley & Sambostic, the beats all pack The Click's signature 'thump'. You need not even question the illness of the lyrics with such song titles as ""She Was Only 16"" and ""Mr. Flamboyant"". ***NOTE: If you can still find the original release of this CD, get it becuz it contains Party In The V-Town, Sahabs, Porno Star, Daily Routine and Ballers, all of which are songs that were cut from the newer, Jive Records version of this CD."
1,This is not the original,"This is garbage because it is not the original. The original had 16 songs the best being ""Let's Side"". This version does not have any of the music samples that made it the most unique rap album of all time. When E-40 came out with the original ""Down and Dirty"" in 1991 It was by far the most talked about album on the streets. But leave it to those idiot's at the record company that purchased the rights to this album to force E-40 to rewrite the songs and rerelease this watered down version post 1993. What a sad day in history. If you can find it look for the original in small used cd stores. I have the original on tape put it is slowly deteriorating because I play so much. Even after 12 years it still is the most hard hitting rap album of all time, The original that is. Not this water down garbage."
1,Boooo! Not the origional.,The origional was much better. This version sucks. I will be getting a refund for this item.
3,sick with jive,"man in my opinion everything sick wid it put out is tight but for some stupid reason jive likes to change cds on people the originals should never have been messed with (federal,down&dirty) are classics and if anybody has them i would love to make a deal with youp.s. someone please tell jive to stop putting out waterd down music"
3,WHAT THAT ORGINAL DOWN&DIRTY SOUTHSIDE LIKE,"Don't get it twisted, this album's still tight, but the original version with all 16 cuts was the bomb. Aint nothin like that old school mobb muzic. I bumped that old cd till it was so scratched it wont play no more. That ish was so tight Id pay pay money to buy that orignial cd all over again."
3,Lets Side,"I have to give this version a three, but the original is off the charts. I hope if/when E-40/Click releases a greatest hits they include some stuff off the original Down and Dirty, especially the last song Let's Side. I am also willing to pay top dollars for a copy of the original."
4,"Great record, but where's the original?","I'm with the rest of these reviewers when I say, give me the 95 tracks! They left the really good songs on, but by taking out the others they messed with the rythm of the whole album. This is what I listened to as I wasted many a day in a teenage wasteland. We'd listen to it front to back, there's just no substitute. They even messed with the songs they left on here!"
5,Let's get drunk my Sahab!!!,"I was there...listening to this album before it was released! The whole Click family was up at my high school back in '92 or '93, personally handing out free copies of this album. My buddy got a copy, we heard it, and were in love with it from the first listen. Because of that, E-40 and the rest of the Click have gotten my respect for all their success, they earned it!The thing that does suck is that the versions of some of the songs changed when I heard it again years latter. I hadn't heard it for a while, and tracks like Let's Get Drunk had a different beat, when the original was MUCH better!Either way, this album is awesome, a must have! All the way down the line, you hear E-40 and B-Legit at their best! Just so y'all know, E-40 started tha fosheezi stuff, not Snoop. Check this album out, you won't be disappointed!"
3,The Click down&dirty,"the click down &dirty started the rise of sick wid it records and various other labels there after.All though I try to listento other artists Ifind my self drawn back to listening to the click and artists on thier label.The rating I gave this particular album a 3""was because it is not the original cut put out by the click but a remix.I and many others like me would gladly pay extra for an orginal cut of down and dirty.In closing Iwould like to say bring back the origanal you would have many happy consumers. Rob H."
3,"STUDY, WATCH, HEARING",I like to STUDY Carter's music. I have at least 10 of his scores. I like to WATCH performers play his music. But I don't really enjoy HEARING his music.
3,Just a thought,"I like Carter's Chamber stuff, especially String Quartett #2, but for some reason his orchestral music doesn't sink in. Maybe that little extra complexity of orchestral sound puts it beyond my ken, I don't know."
1,ARE YOU SERIOUS??????,"This is Garbage!!!!! How can anyone take this atonal mess serously! Life's too short to waste time on this painful,ear-bleeding, excrucialting 'music'. This composer obviously hates his public!"
3,Bad mp3 file separations,"Just a brief warning if you're considering buying the download version. The Clarinet Concerto is divided into separate movements and while they are not segued they are played ""attacka"", i.e., the reverberation of the last chord of the previous movement can still be heard as the next movement starts, so what you hear is an irritating little glitch between movements/mp3 files. Not too awful but annoying. No such problem with the Symphonia where there are two or three seconds between movements."
5,EXCELLENT Film and A+ Commentary,"Some of the reviews made me hesitate at purchasing this film. I was very pleasantly surprised to find it to be an excellent film; great casting, acting, and writing. It differs enough from the film ""Capote"" that admirers would be wise to purchase both films. As an added bonus, the commentary by screenwriter/director Douglas McGrath is superb."
4,It Captures more of the fun of Capote,"While there are those who would argue that this misses it's mark. and I will not argue, having watched it several times with friends, hoping for more each time: my overall impression is that it comes closer to Capote's realities than the Oscar winner's version. I will not dispute his character is overacted and possibly played for laughs from time to time, but, for the fact that its attempts to deal with Capote's interaction with the two murderers in order to write his ""reportage"" novel, are more truthful to what might have caused the gay author to gradually withdraw from life. Also, several of the supporting characters are portrayed as lovingly ""eccentric"", It's not perfect but it beats the other one by far. Kudo's Hollywood."
3,Infamous,"If you are still captivated by the whole ""In Cold Blood"" story, you will be happy to watch anything that might provide more information on this case. This movie didn't, (unless you count the speculation of a sexual relationship between Capote and Smith) but that is, in my opinion, purely speculation. It did however, bring out the personality of Capote better than anything else I've seen. Toby Jones is SUPERB!!!!! It shows his rather childlike charm (and pevish childish self-centered traits). It does an amazing job of that. What it didn't deliver (and what ""CAPOTE"" did), is the serious, sinister atmosphere that a movie about a mass murder SHOULD have. Much of this movie was too light, even humorous. This IS NOT humorous subject matter."
2,Terrible acting all the way around.,"It's difficult to watch this movie after having seen both Capote and the original version of In Cold Blood. Toby Jones' acts as though he's in a terrible satire, definately NOT his best work. I wanted to love this as much as Capote due to the supporting cast but I definately didn't."
2,3rd Best,Perhaps it is because I saw the Philip Seymore Hoffman version or even the Robert Blake Scott Wilson movie first but I just didn't think this movie was nearly as good as the two that came out before it. I find Sandra Bullock to be a second rate actress. She is good in light fluff roles but she is very limited in this role that needed an actress with some chops. This is not a bad movie but it is simply third best in a group on the same topic.
1,Saturday Night Live skit !,"So here is this Toby fellow acting out Truman Capote and leaving the actual theme of the movie to second thought.. Yes, Infamous is the also ran to Capote.. the genius film that won the Oscar for Phil Seymour and rightfully so.This film is flawed from the beginning....for instance--attention to detail--In three success scenes Capote is noshing at The Cocoanut Grove in Los Angeles....to Joe Allen in NY--to well, Im not sure of the venue in the third scene--but this blew it for me right away... I was bent on thumbs down from the outset...and so, in the end, it was appropriate.. ""Infamous""----it is to laugh."
4,Capote from another angle.,"The film ""Capote"" set the standard on this story. I have never come across a similar situation where two films issued close together cover the same ground. However if the quality is as high as this then that is no problem. This film is more sympathetic a portrait of Truman Capote with a cast and script of a higher standard. Daniel Craig is electifying as one of the murderers and worth the cost alone. The film has not had a lot of publicity but do not let this put you off - its one of the best."
4,"A deeper look at Capote, Smith and Hickok","This film delves more deeply into the period in Capote's life when he interviewed Smith and Hickok about the Clutter murders. In that respect, it succeeds. Also, Toby Jones, Sandra Bullock, and Jeff Daniels shine in their respective roles, as does the fellow playing Perry Smith. I don't totally buy the Smith/Capote love affair, so that hurt the credibility a bit for me. Otherwise, a nicely realized film."
5,fantastic listening,"as a long-time art pepper fan, i can say that this album is at the very heart of pepper's playing. His raw and rich sound is as obvious as ever on this album, and is a definite must-have for all those people out there who consider themselves to be loyal pepper fans."
5,I love this artist!!!,"...this album is pure Euro-dance gold, Whigfield has always had this great sound to her, her production team really shines on Whigfield 2,fun, dancy, great sounding music all around. Pick this CD up along with Whigfield 1 and Whigfield 3 for the complete trilogy. A defenite must buy for dance music fans old and new!!!"
3,Fuel tank cap -- not for my car!!!,"While I am sure this is a great fuel cap for SOMEONE'S car, it definitely didn't fit mine! I used the application, plugged in the year, make and model of my car and this was supposed to be the correct one, however it does not fit on a 2006 Volkswagon Jetta!!! So buyer beware!I am hoping that the product cost will be refunded (still waiting) but the shipping is non-refundable! Somehow, that just doesn't seem right!"
2,"Aptly named, but....","Not apt to get into my favorites collection, by a long shot. Most of the cuts have been done better elsewhere."
5,Great Modern Blues,"I admit I love Buddy Guy. I have seen him live twice and Slippin' In does a great job of catching his show. Raw, hard Chicago blues with some R&B and Rock. A must buy for blues fans or anyone wanting to get some BG."
1,This book so doesn't matter,"I read a decent review of this book and thought I'd bite. Bad move. Pontificating and ponderous story from a young Dave Eggers wannabe whose works steals more than innovates. ... ...The writer's connections as a magazine gossip columnist have no doubt helped him finagle a deal for this over-hyped book. The charming Amaden curiously brags about his manipulative abilities in a recent New York Times blurb (4/6/03), a piece that characterized him a self-absorbed, image-obsessed hipster clawing for fame. Many seem to have been taken in by this yawning, pseudo-realistic shout-out to his childhood buddies from Rockville, Maryland, but the story has little point beyond the story of a kid coming of age with divorced parents. Oh-- it takes place in the NINETIES.... Mark Kostabi, meet your literary match."
3,It's all in the voice.,"Amsden has done something I've never seen any other writer pull off, here. He's figured out how to write like contemporary 20-to-30-somethings talk. A dubious achievement, y'might think, given the extraordinarily limited means of expression that seem to be relied upon by such folk (I'm in my early 30's myself, so mea culpa etc.), but amidst all of the ""like, y'know""s there are enough evocative and well-composed sentences to make his writing a pleasure to read, without the appearance of incongruity.The story itself is pretty standard MFA school stuff. Here's How My Parents Messed Me Up. I never got a really clear sense that I understood the characters of either the son or the Dad, apart from the hard-not-to-notice fact that they manage to succeed at making each other Very Sad. There are some nice set-pieces, though - a great, weird-enough-to-be-plausible teenage sex scene, and a wonderful piece of dialogue between the main character and his step-sister."
1,More Chick Lit Tripe,"Will it never end? Another meandering metrosexual book that does absolutely nothing for our generation. An imititation of an imitation of James Joyce, who was imitating a million monkeys sitting at typewriters. The characters are boring. The plot is non-existant. The blurbs are outrageous. The hype is unbearable. The editors at the corporate conglomerates will lose their jobs, and they will have to go hype mutual funds instead. They will be tried by the greater public for spamming the tables at Borders and Barnes and Noble with this insignificant trype, killing trees and engaging in deceit under the guise of irony to pay the rent for their NY roach-infested studio apartments. Well, lying has no place in literature, just like this mediocre, underhanded book."
2,I wish I read the unreadable review,"I consider myself an avid reader, and I love Thomas Jefferson, with that said... this book was a dissappointment. I tried to get at least half way through, but alas the convoluted, coagulated text was unreadable. I think the people who wrote raving reviews were friends or Harvard professors. Thank the lord for the Kindle's dictionary function without it I would have been unable to decifer what the words meant, and a lot of them were in French and the Kindle does not have the French dictionary feature. So I had to guess on those. I would love to be this author capable of such grand text, but I think it was an injustice to the author that he wrote such a difficult to read masterpiece. And maybe it is good that the world does not know that Mr. Jefferson was a depressive wreck."
2,Another unreadable book and another putdown,"It is perhaps hard to be sure this book is a putdown. For some, finding that Jefferson wasn't always rational and calm may make him more human and therefore more appealing, but for me it is a downer. He seems to have had a miseable inner life. Thank God that he was able nonetheless to do a lot of good. The book helps to explain many of Jefferson's wrongheaded views: about Hamilton, about the radicals in the French Revolution, etc.The author is talented but he quotes so extensively from Jefferson's own feelings, which in themselves are so unreadable, that the book necessarily becomes unreadable.This may indeed be a useful contribution to our knowledge but I could have done without it."
3,Good but not for my purposes,"I was looking for a biographical book that I could discuss in some respects with a middle school-aged group. This is an interesting book, but wasn't the best choice. I ended up getting something more appropriate to share with the kids. I still plan to read this, but it didn't grab me enough to do it right away."
3,Not very impressed,"The bed has since been tossed to the side. As a mother, I do not feel it is very sturdy. The frame consistently comes apart...it's a molded plastic construction. The doctor bag with accessories were my children's favorite part and they still play with it two years later. I guess for them, it was an ok item. As a parent I suppose I have higher expectations for items that I pay for. In the end, it matters most if they enjoy it and they seem to have used it a lot so I give it a middle of the line rating...3 stars."
5,Coming back to our mind 13 years later...,"Now in year 2000, as we enter a new century, we experienced renewed political instability and serious threats, having their origin in the market for petroleum in northern South America. Venezuela's President Hugo Chávez might be the threat of the decade. So here it is, I go back to read books on this subject, and I find this one particularly useful. A thorough study, on a subject which is unfortunately so topical nowadays."
1,Terrible product line!,"i've owned several different models of these hunter humidifiers over the years, and they're all junk! they work for ONE season only. if it doesn't bother you to spend over a hundred dollars a year for a humidifier, if it doesn't bother you to treat this as a seasonal, disposable item, then by all means, buy it. Each model we've owned has ceased to operate after one season - the motor simply will not turn on. One year, Hunter's customer service graciously sent me a new one, but even so, to be throwing these units in the garbage each year and contributing to the growing waste problem seems, well, wasteful."
4,"Editorial and ""Kudzu"" Comic Strips","This book is a combination of Doug Marlette's editorial comic strips and his political ""Kudzu"" comic strips covering the 1992 presidential election and Clinton's win. In addition, Doug has done several new strips especially for this book. There are also a few pages of text where Doug writes about Faux Bubba's and his thoughts/accounts of the '92 election (including his meeting with Bill Clinton). While it's obvious that Doug voted for Clinton and is left-of-center in his political views, the strips are mostly funny and mostly told from a southerner's prospective."
3,Basic introduction,Jane Smiths review seemed a bit biased. I will agree that this book has different illustrated different approaches in england than in CA. But then again CA at times seems to think they are a different country than the entire US. It seems she didn't review the book for what it was rather than her own personal agenda.This book can be used to get a basic overview of what it means to take a sustainable approach. THe Author limited its scope to dealing with remedies for existing houses and didn't not focus on new development. Its target audience seemed to be the average Joe.The author does not get to specific on remedies but at least touches on all of the major issues providing an outline for further research or a guide to know what to look out for.I would recomend this book to anyone with no backround or understanding of sustainable building looking for an good introduction.
2,Not very good,"I found this book to be a bit scattered. I constantly found myself flipping to other parts of the book for reference, which was a bit annoying. I found that I didn't finish the book for those reasons."
2,Love can heal...,"Lady Maude Danley has acquired a notorious reputation as being a virtual ogress. Though only twenty one, she is given to fits of rage and odd ways that have terrified all around her. Yet when minstrel Ronan Fitzgerald comes into her world, he sees that there is more to Maude than that. He sees her broken heart and her terrified spirit; he sees she is being torn to pieces by the feud between her clan and another, a war that nearly killed her. He finds himself loving her despite her reputation and the fact that her father wants her to marry someone more noble.** The Linnet makes a strong statement about the power of anger to destroy one's soul, and the effects of revenge. More than that, it shows how love can heal the most broken soul. **Amanda Killgore"
5,Excellent CD,"I have been a fan of Deva Premal for over 10 years. Such an angelic voice. Up until recently, I didn't realize just how talented her husband Miten is. His song ""I'm Just This Empty Heart"" is so beautiful. A sweet invitation to being in the Now."
5,Beautiful,"Its a really beautiful CD. I heard it first when I was staying at my aunts house over the summer and ever since I wanted to have it. I often listen to it before going to sleep. The music is calming, relaxing and spiritual, great for meditation too."
5,wICKEDLY FUNNY STUFF FROM SNL,"Since the beginning, Saturday Night Live has always given us brilliant holiday sketches. This collection combines the classic original cast, right up to recent casts of the late 90's.The list of skits includes:Candace Bergen interviewing Dan Ackroyd as ruthless toymaker Irving Mainway who sells toys like ""Bag O' Glass"" and Johnny Switchblade Punk action figure.John Lovitz who has to fill-in for Santa Clause playing Hanukah Harry...The Classic Alec Baldwin on NPR radio sketch discussing his Shweaty Balls with Molly Shannon and Ana Gasteyer...Steve Martin doing his fireside..""My Wish for Christmas.."" routine...John Belushi as a drunken mall Santa...The Lost Ending to ""It's a Wonderful Life""Gasteyer as a topless Martha Stewart...Eddie Murphy doing a ""Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood"" bit...Adam Sandler doing his usual Hannukah song...All good fun and most of it very good."
3,"Funny, but no Hanukah Harry!","This video was pretty funny. It had mostly newer stuff. I would have liked to have seen stuff from the earlier years. Also, a sticker on the package advertises that the Hanukah Harry skit with Jon Lovitz is on the video, but mysteriously it is nowhere to be found! I am certain there is more material they could have put on this 65 minute video."
4,"Not the best SNL video, but still funny.","It may not have the Hannukah Harry sketch, but this is a funny video. If you are a Saturday Night Live fan, you'll like this video. It has some of the best SNL Christmas sketches from the past to present. Don't be fooled by the ""featuring Hannukah Harry"" sticker on the packaging. It is not in the video."
2,not worth it,Definately a let down. Just not very funny at all. Actually turned it off after about 40 minutes. Don't understand how they pick the clips they do when they aren't even funny!
1,This tape DOES NOT have Hannukah Harry on it!,"It says on the box ""featuring Hannukah Harry"". There is a picture of him on the back of the box. But the Hannukah Harry sketch is not on this tape. The only reason I bought it was for the HH sketch, and it isn't on here. Wah!"
4,"""An Easter Tradition.""",Kite-flying has been a family tradition for Easter for years and it has been great fun for all generations. Unfortunately one out of four of these had a major design flaw and wouldn't fly. It was disappointing for the pilot. The other three were very successful.
1,Disappointed,"I have greatly admired Laura Bush and was eager to read this book. I was hoping for an informative, interesting account of her life. I was greatly disappointed.Felix's book is badly in need of editing. First, the book contains obvious factual inconsistencies. In one chapter Laura's eyes are referred to as blue, in another, green. The book also contains numerous grammatical errors. Finally, Felix includes many confusing and completely unrelated tangents. For example, the first chapter contains a paragraph lamenting the plight of Native Americans in the 1800's. I'm not sure what that has to do with Laura Bush.This book has the feel of a hastily-written English assignment turned in after the first draft and padded with meaningless drivel in order to fulfill the word count requirements."
1,A Rough Read,"This is a rough book to read if you're expecting a reasonably well-constructed narrative like Ambrose or Ryan. If you're looking for some first-hand accounts of action, this book may do the trick. I just found his over-reliance on infinitives ""to be very hard to read."""
3,A Low Down Dirty Shame: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,"Pretty good. Just bought it because I wanted ""The Thing I like"". Great song by the best--R. Kelly & Aaliyah. The dynamic duo. Two great talents. A fan of both. I love Homie, Lover Friend--Remix. It's hot. I did not care too much for the song on his album, but this remix is hot. Great for marrieds who want to be intimate."
5,The Ambassador's first jewel.,"This is the solo album that crowned E-40 the king of rap. This is E-40 at his rawest and hungriest and he kills the competition with every tongue twisting rhyme. His backbreaking flow will hypnotize you from the opening track ""Drought Season"" and will keep you in submission until the final verse of ""Rasta Funky Style"", I believe, if you have the original version. The Jive version is still good but it misses three classic cuts. the aforementioned Rasta Funky Style, Get em Up, arguably one of the best songs on the original cd, and Tanji Part II. If you are one of the few fortunate individuals to steal own the original copy guard it with your life because you are in possesion of something real special. 5 out of 5 stars for federal. This was the making of the worlds greatest game spitter and the most innovative hip hop star of all time."
4,Great start,This is a dope album by a very young and under rated e-40. I brought this in 97 and took a chance buying it because I never heard it. im a big e-40 fan and i have of his other cds but this one got by me. The song federal is super tight that will break your speakers.This cd is great but not as good as the mail man which came after this. But this is a must has if your a e-40 fan cause it has great those old cali mob style beats.
5,Truly Tight,"E-40 at his best... but when is he not??? For real though, this album is a must buy for all you 40 fans. From Rat Heads, to Carlo Rossi Rhine, Stevens covers it all in a sick wid it fashion, to make any rapper green with envy."
2,not worth what i paid fore,"purchasing this device thinking it was cool, it actually wasn't at all what i expect it to be for the price i was paying. the coverage is too narrow, ofcourse it said so already and i know before i bought it but i really regret paying 40 + for it, if it cover 99, and atleast some broader range of i 5, then it is worth it, but for the coverage that it gives, it would only be worth $10 ( not to mention the monthly service charge ).for pro: atleast it gives you and idea of what i5 and 405 is like and the direction of carpool.tip: i wouldn't buy this for anyone i know for gift if i were you."
2,Not what I'd hoped for.,"I was disappointed to discover that the unit only displayed traffic for basically the King County area of I-5 and I-405. As a frequent commuter from Skagit County, I had hoped for broader coverage.As it stands, I probably rely more heavily on radio reports,"
4,Depends,"This item is very good but not as good as it used to be,however, I will continue to use them."
3,For X-files fan people persons,"IF you're an X-files fan, you might enjoy this movie just due to the fact that Two X-file alumni star in the leading roles. Granted ""T-1000"" Robert Patrick or ""Dogget"" on the X-files wasn't the most popular character in the show, but Lauren Holley was on of the original. SO seeing them together in a movie about murder and mystery and spooky things, it's all good to me."
1,bogus Pavement vhs?,"whats the sketch? did this baby come out on vhs or not?I dont think it did, so why is this review and ""for sale"" here?"
2,YOU MUST BE KIDDING?,"This video is almost entertaining until it gets to a part where pretty boy front man, Mad Malkmus, and loverboy Bob Nastanovich are french kissing with their shirts off. I guess thats why this freakish film is only out in France. Believe it or not, while most bands are releasing movies of thier live performances and interviews of the band, the silver jewish spoon boys of Pavement have taken the high road with NO-LIMIT soldier Master P and have released a work of fiction. Very strange trip."
5,Excellent book,This book was a checkout from my local library and after bringing it home and viewing it I was enthralled with every page! I knew that I would be referring to it many times over so instead of rechecking it out at the library numerous times I decided to buy the book.It has so many nice patterns for the beginner and the advanced cross stitcher.The only problem is trying to decide which one I want to stitch first!I have been doing cross stitching for many years and this is the first book that has everything imaginable to stitch!
3,Not her best book,"I own hundreds of needlework books and especially love samplers and to read up on the history of samplers. The Jane Bostocke sampler is the Victoria & Albert Museum in London and, from 1598, it is the oldest known dated and stitch-signed sampler in the English language. I made a pilgrimage to the V&A; so I could see it up close.I have this title in both hardcover as well as paperback. While I love many books from David & Charles publishers, this one leaves me bored. There are a couple unusual types of samplers but honestly, paging through, I haven't found anything to inspire me to stitch. I like her other books much better:Sampler Motif Book: With Traditional Cross-Stitch Designs and AlphabetsTraditional Samplers (Crafts)Exquisite Miniatures: In Cross Stitch and Other Counted Thread TechniquesSmall Scale Embroidery (Crafts)I have employed these for projects and highly recommend them."
5,Outlander Series,This is the last in the Outlander series and is just as great as the preceding novels. Diana Gabaldon is a truly wonderful writer. I have not purchased a book of hers that I have not enjoyed reading.
4,the beat goes on,"It's difficult if not impossible to come up with anything new to add to the 100+ reviews already posted here, and I agree with most of the praise and criticisms. As generally happens, the latter books in this long series lack the intensity and drive of the first 2, so that is not particularly surprising. Jamie and Claire are a characters with immense appeal, and Gabaldon handles their ageing together and their unquestioned devotion to one another with realism. As in life, the other characters here each have idiosyncratic personalities. Yes, Brianna could be whiny, but think about the adjustments she had to make! Sometimes I whine when the electricity fails for a few hours! A Breath of Snow and Ashes is a worthy addition to this beloved saga."
1,Being a successful author means finding editing is gone?,"Knowing that Ms. Gabaldon writes in blocks or vignettes, the lack of transitions between chapters, including one chapter that seemed written earlier, but put into the story at a later point (past the fever/haircut), implies editing that is less passionate or less particular about the story than all of the fans.At the end, everyone is a villain. There is no one left to like among C and J's friends and extended family. Personally, I could have had MUCH less of the hemorrhoid ligature and Manfred's complaint. Even with personal knowledge of Patent Ductus Arteriosus, it seemed like the idea was to extend the page count, not to write a cohesive novel.There are similarities to the Harry Potter series. As an author has more ""power"" with her publisher, the editing seems to become less stringent and the novels less well-paced.I'm not buying any more of these books, but I am glad that there are some who've loved the recent ones."
3,Outlander series,"Diana Gabaldon is by far the best Author I have come across. She takes you on a journey that you never what to stop. A truly great Author and book. Megan Sutherland - Newcastle, Australia"
5,When's the next book coming out?,I love DG and her writing. Everytime a new book comes out it just about breaks my heart when i have to wait two years to find out what happens next.This book was excellent!! A must read for any DG fan!!
3,It's better than Fiery Cross...not hard to do that,Like most Diana Gabaldon fans I fell in love with Crosstitch and the next two books about Jamie and Claire. Fiery Cross was a total waste of paper. It was boring and uninteresting. I was hoping that Diana Gabaldon would write about the charactors as she did in the first few books. I didn't purchase this book with the same positive outlook because of 'Fiery Cross'. So I have read just 500 pages and put the book away. There isn't that 'spark' in the story. The Jamie of the first three books is gone...PITY
3,Not her best....,"This book has to be my least favorite of the Outlander series. The page turner adventures and the heart-stopping romance isn't as prevelant as in the earlier books. Remember when Claire lost the baby in Dragonfly in Amber?? You don't find scenes like that in this book. Also, with Roger becoming a preacher, the religious context is a bit distracting. I honestly thought The Fiery Cross was better. However, this book does have an intersting ending, that combined with my love for Jamie and Claire will prompt to read the next book."
2,Tedious,"When you write a book the size and weight of a housebrick you had better have something pretty important to say. Sadly the sparkle of her earlier books is missing in this work and her customary brilliant descriptive narrative flounders with the superfluous use of adjectives. She has, of late anyway, started subscribing to the school of using ten adjectives when one would do. Her clever use of primary source material lifts the work somewhat, but I would have preferred more eye witness accounts of historical events. I waited with eager anticipation for the earlier books in the series, but frankly I don't care if she writes another."
3,Not as good as the hype,"I loved the first few books,thought the last one was terrible, and was looking forward to the latest after reading many glowing reports. In summary, I was disappointed - but maybe my expectations were too high.The saga was way too long and never achieved the intensity, strong pace and interest of the first few books"
3,"Enjoyable, but not as good as the previous books.","All of the previous books in this series held me spellbound. No so with this one. The story drags and there was surprisingly little ""refresher"" information on many of the characters carried over from the previous books. Still worth the effort though, if only to follow the love story of Jamie and Claire."
3,Loved the first few books - Like this one,"So, as with any series there will be wonderful books and there will be okay books. This book is okay. There are lots of smaller scenes in this book and it doesn't feel as epic as some of the others in the series. I have a feeling this book is the buildup and knowledge back fill that will be needed for the next novel."
5,Just finishing it,As I said about the Firery Cross this is probably my most favorite series. The books in my home library are all tattered from being read over and over. I now buy them on the Kindle.
5,my wife loves them,thanks for your fast service my wife will enjoy her new book than i purchased her for christmas thanks again
4,Never Fails to Satisfy,I am an admited Diana Gabaldon fan! These books are wonderfully written and I am drawn into the story right from the beginning. Each book covers a new bit of history and the details that are written into the story are amazing. As I stated in the title of this review - Diana Gabaldon's books never fail to fascinate and satisfy me!
5,Loved it!,I really loved this book in the series. I was disappointed with Fiery Cross and was hoping that this one would redeem. It did! It was a treat to read it! Can't wait for the next one!!!
4,Minus A Star Because of Brianna....,"The book was magnificant, but like another reviewer, I didn't like Brianna either. Not one bit. She was such a cold person. And I got mad too at that scene where Jamie asked her nicely to leave so he could be alone with Claire, at Claire's covert bidding, and Brianna had the nerve to look right past him and at her mother! And YES! Her antics regarding long-suffering Lord John's secret were appalling. She wanted to plunge head-on into his affairs without regard for anyone else's feelings, except her own, of course. And she would have, if she hadn't gotten her way. I don't know how anybody liked this girl. Lord John had every reason to dislike her; she wasn't all that loving as a mother and she was totally wrong for Roger, who was a wonderful, caring man."
1,WAY WAY WAY too much sex,"I'm no prude, but when a book needs to rely on sex every page or 2 it gets really tedious. Please. It isn't necessary for the plot. The participants were married for heaven's sake."
4,lots of medical details?,"I've read all in the Outlander series. This was a good one. Unfortunately due to the amount of time between books and the author's sometimes deep plots it was a little difficult to follow at times. The book was filled with descriptions of the many medical AND surgical procedures Claire performed on the residents of Fraser's Ridge, but I'm a nurse, so I enjoyed them. Not so sure non-medical folks will appreciate them, especially how she treats Jocasta's eye condition. All in all, it was a great story. Be prepared to do a lot of reading. It did however convince me that I need to re-read the first 5 books."
5,ready for the next book,once i read outlander i went to the book store and got the rest of the books i just spent the last two weeks reading them all i would definately recomend them to anyone now im just upset i have to wait so long for the next book.
5,LOVE THIS SERIES,"This is a beautifully written series that I just can't put down. It's a total page turner with so many different things going on, there's never a dull moment. And at the heart of it all is a beautiful love story. I highly recommend this entire series!"
5,As good as the rest of the series.,"I really like her books, and can hardly wait for the newest book to be released some time after the first of the year."
2,Audiobook - A Breath of Snow and Ashes,"I guess I must've missed the part of the description that said this audiobook was abridged - but I started listening to it, thinking I wouldn't notice the abridgement. After all, the jacket said the author had approved the version. After listening to 3.5 CDs I realized I was missing some important details. So I popped it out and set it aside and hope to read the book (which I own) sometime when I get the chance. Very disappointing."
3,blah,"I read the first two books in about 2-3 days each and couldn't wait to pick them back up every time I put them down. I've been trying to get through this book for about 4 months, and it is difficult. It is so much of the same. It has gotten so boring now. IF I finish this one, it will be my last one in the series. I can't possibly waste time reading another one."
5,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,"Diana Gabaldon's furtile imagination and detailed research has produced another riveting novel. Jamie, Claire and their clan continue their life's adventure in the Colonies. As I read with rapt attention, at one point I exclaimed, ""Oh my God"", out loud as another unexpected twist appeared on the page. Fortunately, I was alone and there was no one around to think I was wierd. There's only one more book left and I will be sorry to say goodbye to these remarkable characters. I have the movie cast in my mind."
3,Not up to the usual standards,"Definitely losing it's lustre as the series goes on (begins with Dragonfly in amber).....the last couple of books are not as interesting as the first several. However, if you follow the series, you will have to read it, slow as it is. I always have to hear how the author ties it up whether I enjoy it or not!!"
2,Bloated and Boring,"I am mystified by all the glowing reviews I have read here. After the disappointment of ""The Fiery Cross,"" I was sure the next book would be more in the style of the first three excellent books in this series. Unfortunately, I was wrong. This book is filled with endless boring descriptions of Claire's medical practice and the diseases she attempts to treat with her 20th century knowledge. There's also way too much of Brianna, Roger and the annoying Jem. And Roger's religious endeavors are a sure insomnia cure. The real action of the book doesn't take place until the last 100 pages or so. The book would have been much better if Claire and Jamie actually lived in Philadelphia or Boston during this period of time instead of North Carolina. All in all, a disappointment."
5,Terrific!,"Although each book of the Outlander series is very good all by itself, it's even better if you read all six. This latest installment is terrific! Some loose ends are tied up, a few amazing surprizes, and of course, the story of Jamie and Claire."
3,Finished reading ABOSN&A and I'm exhausted!!,"Like others who have enjoyed the Outlander series, I think some serious editing would have made this last book much more enjoyable. By the time I reached the end, I was exhausted!!! This book is simply too long and too involved - the story went on forever. Editing and deleting 200 pages of ABOS&A would have enhanced my ability to enjoy this latest book in the series. I stayed with it, but was relieved when I finally finished it."
2,Very Disappointing,"I have been an avid fan of author Diana Gabaldon, and in love with the character Jamie since first reading Outlander years ago.This book, like the preceding Fiery Cross has been a huge disapointment. Me thinks Ms. Gabaldon has gotten very full of herself.......so many words, so little story line! It's like being at a cocktail party and listening to someone who loves to hear themselves talk, go on and on and on and on.... Enough of all the tedious, boring details, Diana. This book could have easily said what she wanted it to in about 1/3 the amount of pages. Maybe we wouldn't have to wait years for the next book, if she'd just cut the length. This book wouldn't win over any NEW readers, how could someone who hadn't read ALL of the previous books even begin to be interested in this overlong, overblown story."
5,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,"I enjoyed this book as I have all of the other books I have read from this series. It is obvious Diana Gabaldon researches as she writes. Flora and fauna are correct for the area and, as far as I know, so are the everyday living events, i.e. food preservation and cooking. Fiction is still fiction but her writing makes it seem more like nonfiction with a fictitious ease of reading."
5,Addicted to Outlander Series,"This is another great book in the Outlander series. I can't believe that these long (900+ page) books hold my interest so well than I am down to the last one in the series since starting in January. I have never been a fan of romance novels, but this is actually a ""love"" novel about an amazing couple and the love that extends to others around them. And the historical info is also fascinating. Just loved it!"
5,Breath of Snow and Ashes,"Whew! The story jumps right in there, with characters in danger from page one. You don't have to read all the series first, as Ms. Gabaldon defines them as the story unfolds. However, Outlanders saved my marriage when my husband was injured... he read them all, knowing that Jamie was a man of honor and passion. Claire's medical knowledge and her reliance on her nose, plus her bravery and willingness to fight for the right, makes her a role model. As a bookseller, I've turned countless people on to the Outlander series. I'm not sorry. I ordered BSA pre-publishing, and I'm not sorry, unless you count the number ordered was 'way too low. One customer told me she took off two days of work to read it, and it was worth it. Its what every book ought to be: fun, passionate, intelligent and a keeper. Thanks, Diana. When is the next one?"
1,Oregongal,I was very disappointed in this book. I felt like the story at times was disjointed and hard to follow. Some scenes in the book seem to be a repeat of scenes from the previous books. After reading the other books in the series I was looking forward to the continuing story of Jamie and Claire but after struggling through this one I wonder how much more there is to tell. The writing is nothing like the first fours books. I could hardly put them down when reading them. This one I couldn't wait to put it back and on the shelf and be done with it.
4,"Next Please, Diana!","The latest book in a series of 6 (the Outlander Series), it was good like all her books are good--brilliantly researched, expertly developed. It was also drawn out and I felt she cheated the story line to allow her to write another installment. If you have a few months, read the series. It's about an American nurse (later doctor) who travels back in time to 19th century Scotland. It's fascinating and you learn--history, botany, medicine, and so much more--and like it. The male protagonist, Jamie Fraser, is one of my most loved characters of all time. The series is worth the time just to get to know him."
5,Not quite done,"An amazingly well written book about the years preceeding the Revolutionary War, including some uprisings in the Carolinas that few people even know about (even historians). For all the fiction, there are layers of fact that sublimely assist in the story.There is much to be said about what this book is not; for starters, is not a conclusion to the storyline, it's not a summation or ending of the tale, and it's definitely not a satisfactory stopping point. There are many items and questions left unanswered, especially with a teaser in the back that is an excerpt of a the 'last' novel in which Jaimie leads a regiment of soldiers in battle during the American Revolutionary War."
2,A disappointment,"I'm only 50 pages into this book, but I have no desire to read anymore. I'm bored to tears. There's one too many POV's (every character, it seems, has been given one) and there is NOTHING happening. We've been dropped into the middle of daily life in the 1700's. Doing wash, raising children, watching our neighbors get married. There really is nothing more interesting than that happening, and from reading the other reviews, I gather that's all there IS to this book. I started to read it for the love of Jamie and Claire and I feel...deprived. Sorry, but I don't recommend this one. I'd rather re-read Outlander again than trudge through this one."
5,Sheryl got it in one.,"I have really enjoyed this series. Reread DOA and TFC because I knew the new book was coming - and there's a lot to remember from one of these books to the next. And this new book is good. Great story; powerful characters - even the ones that are less than endearing (""I'm a doctor, you know."") If you have followed this series, you will enjoy this book. But that ending!! What is that supposed to mean??!! DIA was a better ending - you knew it meant Fraser lived - even if you didn't know how or what happened until the next book. My first reaction was ""Dammit Diana""."
5,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,I've been reading the Outlander series. Diana Gabaldon is an excellent writer as she manages to keep the reader in suspense always eager to find out ...what's next!!
4,ALMOST love it,"Every decade I give myself the gift of rereading the Outlander series. This third time I'm still seeing nuances missed the first two reads. If I have any criticisms, it would be that Diana 'pads' too much with other literary quotations. I don't bother trying to read the Gaelic entries, they're unpronounceable anyway.By now I'm wishing that Claire and Jamie could have some peace and quiet. Action is good, but this is really over the top."
4,Nice book,My wife bought this book to read on her kindle. She enjoyed it very much and it was a great purchase.
1,Huge Disappointment,"The others in the series were great, and I really looked forward to A Breath of Snow and Ashes. It read like it was all Gabaldon's discarded notes for the previous installment. I felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book."
5,Gabaldon writes beautifully,"First, let me state my biases in favor of American history. If you want Persian finery or Bourbon splendor or Tudor courtliness, look elsewhere. With a touch of ""Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman"" Claire acts as frontier surgeon in the hills of North Carolina on her and her husbands enormous ranch around the time of the Revolution. Not wanting to spoil the story, this is a tremendous adventure novel, and Gabaldon's writing grabs hold and won't let go. Great value for money. Recommended. Sheesh, the title alone wants to make you pick it up! The contents won't disappoint."
4,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,"I am enjoying this book series. When reading I see myself traveling to that time frame and working along side Jamie,Clair,Bree, and Roger. It's really unique that Bree is adapting furture luxuries to the past at such an early time. For people who enjoy time travel or even if they like the time period I would recommend this series."
4,300 pages too long,"OMG - can one more person get kidnapped? I do agree with previous reviews that everything wrapped up into a neat tidy package, but if one more person got kidnapped I was going to lose it. I am a huge fan of the series, but this one could have wrapped everything up in a lot fewer pages! Truthfully I'm glad it's over!"
4,Relieved...and enthralled once again,"Like many readers who were captivated by the uniquely rich portrayal of the lives of Jamie and Claire in the early books of the Outlander series, I steadfastly plowed through Drums of Autumn and The Fiery Cross. I simply could not leave the series unfinished, although at times I thought about it. A Breath of Snow and Ashes was worth the wait. It is vintage Gabaldon reminiscent of the action, emotion and subtle yet surprising plot twists found in Outlander, Dragonfly in Amber and Voyager. There are trials and tribulations of the historical period as well as depictions of living a simple yet full life that seem to provide a wonderful backdrop for the characters who have seasoned and matured through the series. It seems to me as if Ms. Gabaldon went back to the basics and wrote to please herself rather than the leagues of fans who badger her for the next installment in the series. I am content to wait for however long it takes for the final installment!"
2,"Love the characters, hate the editors","I've been reading the Outlander series non stop for over a month. I have noticed that the continuity has been changing over the series. It started as tiny changes between books, but has slowly degraded into continuity errors within the same book! I loved the last five books, but felt that this book was a real let down. The book read as though it was three books combined into one, and certain plot points seemed thrown in to add length to the novel. As much as I have enjoyed reading about Jamie and Claire, I have to give this series up. This was too poorly planned a sequel for me to try and muscle through the next. The book also contained multiple typos (words with letters dropped, sentences without subject verb agreement, etc) that really detracted from the experience. While I appreciated the journey and the changes in Jamie and Claire, the poor editing job on this book made me realize that the magic is gone."
3,My least favorite in the series,"I am surprised by the glowing reviews everyone seems to be giving this book. It is by far my least favorite! I read the first 3 books in the series within a few days. I was blown away. But it took me 2 months to get through this one. And I have to admit there were more than a few pages of lengthy descriptions of medical procedures and scenery that i just skimmed over. If there really is another Claire and Jamie book to come, bring back the fast paced adventure and sexy romantic drama of the first 3!"
2,DIsappointing,"An admission first - I am still on page 700 or so, and it's taken me two weeks to get this far, far more time than had taken me for ALL of the first five books.The problems with this book are myriad: most had been mentioned before - the lack of story development; the emphasis on brutal, physical injury, ofttimes in excruciating detail (I had to skip four pages at one point); a startling lack of humour.Mostly, I am appalled by the destruction of the joy and love between her characters by Ms Gabaldon, who seemed intent to prove her mastery of her historical facts at the expense of the humanity of her characters.I cannot recommend it except to MS Gabaldons's die-hard fans."
4,Questions are Answered!,"If you've been waiting for certain things to be resolved . . . well, you're in luck. It was with a great deal of satisfaction that I finished this book (at 2:30 this morning), because I finally had answers to a lot of the things I'd been wondering about.Unlike Fiery Cross, this book is much faster moving, with no long descriptions of diaper-changing. Brianna and Roger seem to have found their places at Fraser's Ridge . . . Brianna is much more likeable, much more mature, and a lot less whiny. And, of course, Claire and Jamie are featured very prominently . . . it's still their series. There's action, adventure, abduction, illness, war, and of course, sex.A book more in the tradition of Voyager and Drums of Autumn . . . I wasn't disappointed."
3,Okay,"So far, none of the last few books at least for me has even come close to matching the first two. This was more of the same - not a lot of tension, and pages and pages of just life at the Ridge. And how many pregnant out of wedlock girls, cheating husbands, and rapes can possibly happen to one group of people?!I liked it and read it because I love the characters, but not even close to the fun of the first two books."
1,Dreadful book quality,No issue with the story - but this particular edition is tiny - which makes it almost square. It's so thick that the paperback binding is bound to break before you're halfway through ... and the text is so small as to be almost unreadable. Don't waste your money - get a bigger / hardback version!
5,ABOSAA,I love Diana Gabalbon! She paints such a story that you feel your right there with the characters. I wish that all the unabridged audio books in this series were available at Amazon.
4,Good Reading,This series was written well. I had an easy time getting into the characters. Sometimes too wordy but overall a great read if you like a little mystical twist in your books.
2,Horrible and Cheated????? Agree with these previous reviewers.,"I have never written a review before and I considered Diana my favorite author. I talked her up to everyone--refused to read other books because nothing compared to hers. I waited for this book--ordered it 6 months ahead. What happened? Instead of hardly waiting to pick this book up, I have a hard time JUST picking it up. I am almost halfway through and had to call my friend to see if she had similar reactions. She did. This book does not ""make us care"" like the previous ones. We both reread the others, but this one. It's true, I can't get interested in anyone except Claire and Jaime. Brianna I can't even picture and don't want to. I feel bad even writing this as I always have looked forward to the day I could meet Diana and praise her and tell her how she had spiced up my life. Don't know what else to say---just really disappointed. Wish I wasn't!"
3,this is a pretty drawn out breath...,"this is going to be a rather quick review, hitting the high points and low points of the book.1. It seems to be taking an awfully long time for the American Revolution to happen already. Perhaps we could have cut out yet another ""Claire is in Peril"" scene and moved along with history?2. I like the introduction of the other time travelers, but i'm not certain what the message here is - are all time travelers save Claire and her brood full of nefarious intent? Why do they all have to end up as villians?3. There was a whole lot of exposition for Ian's relatively underwhelming story about why he left the Mohawk's.The good, of course, is the careful attention to detail that Gabaldon is known for. As an author, she has a gift of bringing you into the story and not letting you go. Also, then ending shows promise - there are two ways that the next book could go and my vote is that they focus on Jamie and Claire again."
3,Too many....,"Yes, well... The 6th installment in the series. Too many characters, too many plots, too many abductions, too many girls pregnant out of wedlock, too many!! So, my enchantment with this series is fading. I really like the first 2 books, but then, it kind of goes downhill quickly. Jamie & Claire are living in 1770's, waiting for the War to start. Jamie has to choose carefully, as he has friends on both sides. Still good writing, but I think the author has lost sight of the goal a bit."
4,Best of the Outlander series,"Very well written, historically accurate historical fiction. Not a stand alone book. Much better if you have followed the Outlander series. But this is the best of the series so far. Good read. Don't be daunted by the length."
3,It is hard to stay interested.,"I was trying to catch up after several years aways from the series. This one didn't engage me at all. It's okay but seems like formulaic, lazy writing. Nothing new. I will try again since it's on my Kindle but really need something to catch my interest and this wasn't it. The narrative descriptions are still stellar and visual. It is the characters that have become hum drum."
4,Love Gabaldon. This isn't her best,"This wonderful series chronicles, not only the exciting lives of these charming characters, but also Diana's skills and imagination. She took a few too many leaps from credibility in this one to keep me from rolling my eyes. It is still a great read, and I am still a devoted fan."
5,the right mix,Gabaldon's novels give me the right mix of history and fiction -- with her special time travel twist allowing the 21st century perspective to continually bear on the 18th. They are just plain fun to read!
4,A Great Series,"This is one of the last of the books of the Outlander series. I have been reading this series of books, one after the other, for about four months, and the amazing thing is I'm not bored with them yet! These are great books to pick up, read a little and put down, as the story is easy to follow. I would recommend them to someone , say, traveling. The author has a wonderful way with words that makes me able to visualize the era she writes of as if I were there."
5,OMG,"Sometimes I wonder how I will ever find another series to occupy my attention? Diana Gabaldon, where have you been my whole life :)"
2,Too Small,I ordered these for my 83 year old father. They are good quality but I thought they ran small. He wears a 12. I ordered a 12 and couldn't get them on his feet.
1,NEVER BUY FROM AMAZON!!!,"I bought several different types of dog treats and they had only one Chicken Flavor treat. They had the nerve to send the one dog treat (chicken) separately. The treat was only a few dollars but they CHARGED ME FULL POSTAGE FOR THE ONE DOG TREAT, WHICH I BELIVE was OVER 5 DOLLARS."
3,Poor artistry,"I don't know why DG took Narciso Yepes on. Maybe, because the music in the film made him famous? He plays all these wonderful Spanish guitar pieces without any sense of poetry nor feeling. His tone is ugly (strings are squeezed too much at times) and the dynamic range is either forte or piano, nothing inbetween. A music student would play better than this. I don't like John Williams' machine-like precision, but these performances are even worse."
1,Not What expected!!!,This book was not what I expected it to be. Unstead of Expressions for scrapbooking and cards it is a book of clipart. I was very disappointed in the content of the book.
2,Very disappointing quality,"This book reminds me of old-fashioned, inexpensive clip art. As a graphic designer I know my standards may be higher than others who ordered this book, but personally, I was very disappointed with the quality of these illustrations.While several of the ideas are good, the art itself is far from what I consider usable. Rather than the professional looking product I was expecting for the price, this looks like someone compiled all their ""doodles"" and ideas, photocopied them and bound them in a book. Not worth the price. I'll be returning it."
4,Very Handy,I really enjoyed the book. I have not totally utilized the book yet. (really busy) I can't wait to use it to its fullest. It has a lot of good pics and blurbs that will come in handy when scrapbooking.
2,Just Okay,"I am an avid scrapbooker, with many materials to work from, and this book was the least helpful. While cute, and filled some ideas, it isn't very practical for serious scrapbookers. It may be good for beginners to get ideas, but I wouldn't recommend it for the more creative persons."
2,Book,"Not the book I was looking for. I thought it would be a book of scrapbooking quotes, not drawings and sayings"
1,Scrapbooking,I have never recieved the 500 Great Heartwarming Expressions for Scrapbooking and Cards. Can you Please check to see where the order is???????????????????????? Frances
1,Not Impressed,"I purchased this for making cards. The entire book is little pictures for kids - not card quotes for adults. If you want something for masculine birthday cards or adult birthday and anniversary cards, this is not the item to buy. Don't waste your money."
3,Da Vinci,"In this picture books it shows the life of one of our greatest people of his time. Born in 1452 he was a man who brought new inventions to our world whose imagination had reached centuries beyond his own realm. he was an artist who brought realism to the art world as well as science. the Renaissance has been visioned through his work and life. The book is a little lengthy for a child to read, I think but at the same time makes up for that in the vibrant pictures we see throughout the book. I think children will have a great time with this book as they learn about one of the most important people in our human existence."
3,Not as good as the rest of the oeuvre.,"Clayton Eshleman, Fracture (Black Sparrow, 1983)I never thought I would say it: I found a Clayton Eshleman book that really didn't do much for me.As usual, when Eshleman is on his game, he is very very on his game. Every once in a while, the book kicks out one of those poems that just makes you sit back and say ""whoa."" (Interestingly, these are far more common in the book's later poems.) The majority, however, do not do this; Eshleman seems to have temporarily forgotten that ""show, don't tell"" is not only a phrase, but a way of life.Having read and enjoyed material from both before and after this book, I have to wonder whether this is simply an anomaly. For the Eshleman completist only. **"
1,Its in French stupid!,"Silly me, I ordered this book (I'd heard the play via the internet from the BBC and wanted to read it) not realizing that it was in its original language. IF you read French (I don't, despite the efforts of teachers many years ago) I'm sure it would be enjoyable."
5,Classic,"Chiors were a big part of music when this came in 1961. Bing Crosby, Mitch Miller, TV and radio adds, chiors were like the guitar is now. Thus went life in a pre-Beatle world.So why not put them in jazz. That is what Donald Byrd did on New Perspective. But this is no easy listening or TV sing-along. Byrd has taken a lean blues used by the best in jazz, and added vocals. Along with top notch soloing and a fantastic backing unit, that included Herbie Hancock, these voices add an incredible fluidiity and swing to what is already jazz at its highest peak. This is profane music with a gospel reverance.If you don't know this album, your jazz education is not complete. Cut and dry, that is it."
3,Pretty Good but I got spoiled but His Later work more,this set isn't bad at all.He takes on a few styles here&some things work.but Compared to His Early 70's Output the Music Here doesn't have that Lasting vibe for me.the Musicianship here is sharp but the Material overal doesn't hold up to me.but I have enjoyed many of His Recordings&He has a Cool Tone in His Work.
2,Flimsy,"Very flimsy plastic. These used to be made out of thicker plastic, but these ones are very cheap, and the edges are not even smooth, looks like they were cut in someone's garage. What happened, AVS?"
5,"The Geography of Odysseus, Herodotus, Pytheas and other ancient explorers and dreamers","If you've ever wondered about the conceptual context in which Homer envisaged Odysseus' meandering homeward voyage, Pytheas' likely plan as he sailed his little craft towards the mysterious ""Thule"", and Herodotus' ""knowledge"" of the earth as he penned his travelogue embracing actual as well as grotesque creatures and places, here is a detailed and readable guidebook. When one speaks of ""geography"" in connection with the ancients, there is more than a touch of literary craft underlying these conjectures. All this has been discussed by Dr.Romm in The Edges of the Earth in Ancient Thought. However, Romm's survey is briefer and only concerned with the imagined world beyond the ""oukemene"" as the Greeks referred to the known world. This book is a fascinating study in the blending of myth and scientific conjecture."
4,Surround sound speaker stands,"These stands are as advertised and very good.The good - good quality, sturdy and very stable with small Klipsch HDT1000 surround speakers. Several mounting solutions and 1 worked with these speakers. Choice of straight or angled upper pole.The not so great - Speaker wires come out of the pole above the base instead of going all the way to the floor and exiting under the base. Poles are rather thick and visually obtrusive. I may paint mine the color of the walls to help minimize. They come with the straight poles installed and removing them and installing the angled ones was a little difficult."
4,Versatality,The unit had plenty of additional parts to adapt to any make or model of speakers. The height too can be adjusted between a range of about 4 to 10 feet.
4,Speaker Stand,The picture is deceiving. The stand itself is a very thick stand. I have an Onkyo system and I use these for the surround speakers. They look very small on top of the thick construction. I kept them because I have them concealed by plants. I would recommend these for front or mid speakers. They are awesome stands and very durable. Don't think they will ever break or wear out. The only reason I gave them a 4 star is the picture.
4,Many options - very flexibile - 58 inches!,"These stands are made of good quality materials and include many mounting options including two different sized plates, an ""L"" bracket, and a few other options. The ability to raise them to 58"" is great to help create more realistic surround effects. Hardware was well labeled and easy to assemble. My only concern was that at full extension they leaned a little, so I opted to keep them a little lower (about 50 inches). Rated for up to 10 lb. speakers, but mine were only 5. Other than that, they are excellent and worked nicely with my Polk VM10's. (Not to mention, a lot cheaper than Polk's stands for these speakers that cost four times as much!)"
5,good tall stands,"If you want tall, sturdy stands, these are for you. I am 5'4"" and I can adjust them to my eye level. They are also very sturdy so you won't have to worry about your stands falling. Better prices than in stores."
5,Good stands,The stands are very good. I agree with previous reviews that the paint can chip if you're not careful.I made my own braket out of wood that I attached to their L bracket so I could use both mounting holes on the speaker. Just my personal preference. I mounted Boston Aucoustics MC130 speakers. They weigh just over 5 lbs. per speaker.I am actually ordering another set for my center channel.
5,Excellent and very versatile speaker stands,"I am very impressed by these speaker stands. All the other positive reviews have really summed it up. I do want to comment that I read a review that mentioned having to install Energy Take speakers upside-down. I have Energy Take speakers and I found that these speaker stands came with so many mounting options that I was able to find one that worked beautifully without having to resort to mounting them upside down. I love that they come with options to use a straight or tilted setup. I highly recommend these solid, sturdy, and versatile speaker stands!"
3,the manual is very difficult to understand,the manual is very difficult to understand.i did one step wrong and can't get one part apart from the other.returned.
3,"Work well enough, but glad I have some electrical tape","These help you thread audio wire through them well enough and are certainly heavy enough to protect against being bumped, but actually getting my speakers attached using just the mounting system wasn't all that possible. Unless I just horribly messed up, the screws basically strip through and I just had to use electrical tape to fully secure the speakers to the mount. The speakers I have mounted are from a Klipsch Quintet III set.That said, I have no complaints since the speakers are right where I want them. However, I can't say I'm impressed with the quality of the mounting system."
3,"Nice, but. . .","I have been around high end audio and video since the 1970's, and have had experience with the finest money can buy. When I saw these, and saw the claim to reproduce the Dolby experience consistent with Dolby Labs specs., I was ready to pull the trigger. The product itself is well-made and of first quality. Assembly was a breeze. However, none of the various mounting plates and adaptors worked properly with my Klipsch Quintet II speakers. One set mounted properly to the speaker, but did not tilt the speaker downward as required of the rear speakers. I contacted the factory, and they said they were not aware of the problem, and that they might not engineer a fix. In short, if you are wanting the Dolby experience, buy these IF they will work with your speakers."
5,Sansus System Hover Speaker Foundation,"Heavy duty, easy to assemble. Purchased on line, saved $20, free shipping too. Would definately recommend if considering for surround sound speakers."
3,"Nice, but...","These are really very sturdy stands - with loads of installation options and a durable finish. They are just a bit too sturdy and durable for my living room. I'm wishing I would have researched options a bit more. That said, given the quality of what I purchased (Sanus HF1-B1), I'll definitely look at Sanus stands when it comes time to replace these..."
5,AMAZING SPEAKER STANDS!!! (PRICE IS FOR 2 STANDS),"THE PRICE IS FOR 2 STANDS!!!CEILING OR IN WALL SPEAKERS.... NOT NEEDED!SPEAKER WIRE RUNNING THROUGH THE WALL... NOT NEEDED!LONG STORY SHORT; THESE STANDS ARE THE PERFECT (AND INEXPENSIVE) WAY TO MAXIMIZE YOUR H0ME THEATER EXPERIENCE.WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU CAUGHT YOURSELF DUCKING BECAUSE YOUR HOME THEATER WAS SO REALISTIC?I CANT BELIEVE IM RAVING OVER SPEAKER STANDS, BUT THATS HOW GLAD I AM I PURCHASED THESE STANDS"
1,Price for single?,"What I don't get is the price. It appears to be a price of $55 for a single stand because nowhere in the description does it mention pair or show a picture of a pair. But the manufacturer sells a pair for $89 and Best Buy sells a pair for $79 (at the store if they stock them which they appear not to). So with the above price I would pay $110 for two?? Even with shipping comparisons, it's a puzzle. Where's the deal?Otherwise Amazon or their substores needs to do a better job for the description of many of the products I find online. Terrible way to sell if you have to go to another site just to read up on a product."
3,Great value for the money,"Pros: The stands are stable and pretty heavy-duty. The price is what made me jump on this deal.Cons: I don't THINK the adapters were made for Panasonic speakers and I didn't want to use the double-sided tape provided; however, I was able to improvise and use the adapters; it doesn't look pretty but it works. The base doesn't attach to the pole very easily and it was a little tough feeding the speaker wire through the pole; however, everything works.Even with three stars, I would likely buy another pair, if needed."
4,Not Bad,This is an intrestering video - I know and work simular kata - we were never allowed to film them. The Kata is shown and Bunkai explained well. Of one complaint is that the DVD seams to have been copied from a VHS or other lower quilty filming - so the video is a bit grainy.
2,Not worth it,"This video is not really worth the money. You would think from all the names that the video would be awesome, but it is not good at all. I would keep my money if I were you."
4,Useful but not perfect,"I don't know, this is quite a good little book but something is definitely missing. It covers a lot on oscillator theory but when I needed to build a special saw tooth oscillator, it had no information at all. It seems to have a blind spot for practical circuits and ideas and above all certain equations. (scratching my head I wondered if the censors had banned oscillators slightly recently) It is still a good book though and if you've never seen a klystron before is very interesting."
1,Terrible Product...Terrible Company!!!!!!,"I recieved this griddle as a christmas gift in 2008. The first time I used it the food stuck. Within three uses the ""non-stick"" coating startd coming off on my food. This griddle is useless. I contacted the company for a refund or a differnt griddle. They originally told me via email that they would replace it with any other Rival griddle and I could call their customer service line. When called, I informed them that it was a gift and I did not have the receipt. They asked me for the codes on the griddle and then informed me that my ""1 year warranty"" had expired!! It has only been 2 months!!!!!!! Do Not buy this product!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not a great griddle,"I have had this griddle for about two years, purchased at Target. The other reviews mention the bad non-stick surface which was also true for me. I have always had to grease the griddle. The surface didn't last and has bubbled and chipped and I have been avoiding those areas when using the griddle. it is now rusting in those small spots. It was rarely put in the dishwasher and we are finally throwing it away... Though I did regularly use it for pancakes with success, that was all because it never really worked well enough for anything else. You have to let it heat up a very long time to ensure that it is heated more evenly. The button latch to hold down the tray did not break. If they could make a better cooking surface, I believe I would be really happy with the product."
2,Cruiser1,"I have had this griddle for about 1 1/2 yrs. I agree with most others. One side heats better than the other. After first few uses items stopped sticking. I did like it for creating the filling for breakfast burritoes, you know hashbrown potatoes,sausage,bacon,eggs and cheese wrapped in tortillas. But now everything sticks it has heat marks from where the element is and the teflon has worn off. I bought this when it first came out and only paid $20 for it so I guess I got my moneys worth. But when you have 4 children waiting on their pancakes you can't have some cooked others stuck and falling apart. I am currently looking for a new griddle hope I find one worthy enough to stand up to the demands that I put on my cookware."
1,Absolutely worthless,"I've had this for a while. I bought it for the removable griddle. I've not had anything break and the non-stick seems about normal for inexpensive pots and pans.However, the heating function is absolutely worthless. This is a design flaw and seriously effects cooking.I set my unit at 300 and used a digital thermometer to measure the temperature. It fluctuated from 224 to 269 a difference of 45*!!It cycles between high and low. Once it reaches the high temp, it turns off and starts cooling. While it is cooling, turning the temperature up has no effect.This leads to undercooked pancakes in one batch, and overcooked, scorched pancakes the next time.I've written to the company, but am not expecting any response. What a waste of time and money."
1,Everything stuck to the cooking surface,"After three or four uses I finally gave up on this griddle and threw it away. (I did not buy it through Amazon) Pancakes and even bacon seemed to be Superglued to its ""nonstick plate"" and fell apart when I tried to remove them. Do not waste your money on this frustrating, useless appliance."
1,WHAT A PIECE OF [...]!,"I don't understand all the reviewers that complain of food sticking to the surface, because I had the opposite problem. The manual says to cook hamburgers at 350 degrees. Yeah right! I had the thing cranked up and preheated for about 20 minutes to 400 degrees (highest temp), and when I put six burgers on the grill they immediately began shedding all their juices, and merely stewing in them, because the plate obviously wasn't hot enough.I just bought this at Target tonight and I'm planning on returning it first thing in the morning. Funny thing, as I was walking out of the store, I thought to myself, ""I'd better keep this receipt handy in case this thing doesn't work right."" It's too bad, because the removable and washable grill plate was a good idea. Just another sad commentary on the poor quality of currently mass-produced household appliances. Boy am I pissed!"
1,HORRIBLE,After receiving this griddle for Christmas and using it and having everything stick. I decided to come online and email Rival along with trying to find reviews. I found what I was looking for and it sounds like we aren't alone in the dislike in this product. I agree with everything I have read the only thing I haven't done is throw my grill away. I'm currently going to do some research on a new grill before buying a new one you can bet that it won't be a Rival product.
2,Don't waste your money,"I have had this item right at 6 months. I use it on weekends when we have a Sunday breakfast and that it not every single Sunday...It is not as ""non stick"" as they say it is. It scratches easily and the ""non stick"" surface wears thin quickly. I know how to use and care for teflon surfaces, I am a mom of 30 years and this aint my first rodeo...Lastly, it heats unevenly, the left side gets hotter than the right side and just in spots at that. I am now trying to contact the company trying to get e replacement griddle for it and I have no options to contact them except to call, I prefer e-mail but that is not an option this huge corporation offers. You would think I could simply e-mail customer service, but not with these guys.Seriously disappointed... this was not a good value for the money."
3,"Decent shoe, not an investment piece","This shoe is stylish and looks good with a number of outfits, however the footbed is hard, the heel is made of shiny plastic. It is not uncomfortable, but to be blunt it is just not the quality I look for."
4,Entry Level Alpine is Always a Good Value,"These Alpine's are really clear and tight. They provide great balance for my new car stereo. These specs - 92 db and 32 htz - campare favorable to almost any other high-end car speakers available.After all these years, there's still only 2-3 main choices for good car speakers: Alpine, Infinity, or Polk Audio. Alpine is the best value of the bunch."
5,Alpine Speaker,I bought these for my daughters car. She loves them. They sound great and were easy to install.
1,Do not buy this.,"I thought the other person had bad luck with the download, to my horror, that was not the issue. The whole book is copy scanned and is un readable like he said, I am angry I wasted my money. I should have heeded his review, now I have to spend more money to get what I want."
5,cute and great for the price,Elmo arrived very well packed with his eyes covered as well ! which was great as the eyes were intact :) the toy is cute but no educational value. I ordered it as my daughter is a big fan of Elmos but other than that its a great size for that price !
5,Babies and Toddlers adore this toy!,"To say my 3-year-old adores the Cookie Monster plush would be a gross understatement. So when her sister was born last year, we got the baby this Elmo doll. It too is a great hit, and it has become the baby's best friend. It's soft and snuggly, plus she loves sucking on its hard eyes. Elmo's a little less baggy than the Cookie Monster, but still plenty soft and cuddly. (I haven't needed to wash Elmo yet, but the Cookie Monster has seen the washing machine and dryer several times over his 3 years and has held up well These are very sturdy toys.)That's 2 for 2. Maybe for baby #3 we'll spring for another plush from this collection...Big Bird perhaps? :)"
3,Doesn't really look like Elmo...,"My kid, a huge Elmo fan (which two-year-old isn't?), actually shunned this toy after unwrapping it on Christmas morning. I thought she wouldn't notice how subtly unlike Elmo this plush looks, but I guess you can't fool the experts. She's warmed to it over the last few weeks, so it isn't going to waste.The problem is that the head (on the one I received, at least) is a bit too vertically narrow (like Bert's). When I squeeze the back of the head a bit, it looks a lot more like Elmo. Also, it isn't 13"" tall...but I'm fine with the size as it is. Build quality is also more than acceptable."
4,scaredy boy,My 18month old son has been obsessed with Elmo for a couple of months now. So for christmas we decided to get him his own. I love it! My son on the other hand is scared to death. He wouldn't get down off our couch until I hid both Elmo and Grover in another room. He'll warm up to it eventually though!
4,Good buy,Is toy is great for little Elmo lovers. I thought it would be a little bigger but the small size ended up being perfect for my nephews little hands.
3,Small,"Elmo was no where near 13"". Priced very low which is nice, but Elmo is much smaller than he should be. I guess on this one, you get what you pay for."
2,Came with a rip.,"My son loves Elmo. So I was excited to find this I thought he could carry it around with him. It wouldn't be too big or too small. However, he's not interested in him at all! And worst of all, Elmo came with a rip in his arm."
5,"So, so, soft! A winner.","The fur on this plush Elmo is delightful. When I opened the box I expected he'd be bigger, but now I realize that he's just the right size. He is delightfully made, and the added padding in his feet make them swing back and forth if you wiggle him in the air. I also didn't expect his mouth to open and close, which was an added bonus. My husband was glad that this toy MAKES NO ANNOYING NOISES! A perfect gift for my little toddler."
4,Very Soft Gund,"I buy this for my one year baby, he loves Elmo. This is so soft. His nose is diferente texture, and his eyes are hard. I give 4 stars because the paint of his eyes is no durable, it's fun because it's an Elmo with his smile, and educational because encourage the love by hug of the child.I recomende this Elmo Gund."
3,Hot Pink!,Not as red as elmos normally is. Have to go and get one from store but my son still loves it.
4,Beloved Elmo,"My daughter got this for her second birthday about two and a half years ago. My son got his at age one and a half a little over a year ago. The toys have both held up very well and are among our kids favorite stuffed animals. My only complaint is that the paint on the eyes does scratch off. But, for the price, they are great!"
1,AWFUL MATERIAL,"Right out of the box, my daughter was covered in Elmo's red ""fur""...for any child who puts everything in their mouths (which is every child!) this is NOT a good plush. Within seconds, my daughter put it in her mouth...and ended up with a mouthful of red fur. We took our Dyson vacuum to him, and still, he was leaving fuzz everywhere...especially in her mouth. I see that Amazon has posted a warning ""Not for children under 3"", however, this item comes with a tag that states Ages 0 and up. And I linked to the Amazon site from the Gund site, so they are advertising it for children under three. In any case, while the plush is cute, its really for children who are past he putting everything in their mouth phase. And someone needs to decide the age appropriateness on this one....Gund is saying all ages, Amazon is not. We'll put him away for a while until our daughter is able to handle a plush that ""sheds""."
2,Disappointed in size.,"I ordered this doll based on the height description and picture. I was very disappointed and promptly returned the 2 that I ordered. The 13 inches actually includes the eyes which stick up above the head. Head to toe, the doll is just above 11.5 inches. The doll is so skinny and other than the head, really flat. Belly measures 4 inches wide at the widest part, head about 3.5 inches wide."
5,Must have for elmo lovers,"I got this for Christmas for my GodDaughter and I know she is absolutely going to love it. This toy is a must have for parents, or grandparents for their child. Also it is safe for younger children being that is it plush, with no small parts."
3,Very cuddly,"Ordered for my 2 yr old grandson. He is an Elmo fan, so he loves it. Very soft and cuddly--fur is short, making it a great toy for little ones. My only complaint is that the description said ""place of Origin:USA"", which I assumed meant it was made in ths USA. This is one reason I chose this Elmo. However, the tag on Elmo said ""made in China"". I gave 2 3-star ratings only beacause of this.Gund Sesame Street Elmo 13"" Plush"
4,Good Stuffed animal,I think my daughter would have liked this toy a little more if she didn't get the Elmo live doll at the same time. But we got her the elmo and grover together and she does like to carry them around when we put away the elmo live doll (cause that thing never shuts up). Good doll if your child loves elmo as ours does.
5,Elmo stuffie,"I ordered this toy for a 2 yr old at it is the perfect size, we do our Christmas on New Years day and I am sure when she opens it she will be very happy"
4,Perfect for Elmo Fans!,Gund Sesame Street 13-Inch ElmoThis Elmo doll is perfect for any Elmo fan! It's soft and cuddly and just the right size. Our son loves having his very own Elmo.
4,"Now, Elmo will ask a baby...","My son is 16 months old and recognizes Elmo and Cookie Monster on sight, so I bought him this plush toy plusGund Sesame Street 12-Inch Cookie Monster. I think Grover (Gund Sesame Street 14-Inch Grover) was out of stock; he's MY favorite. You know what's really sweet? Seeing him give these toys a hug. The texture is soft and comforting to him, and the eyes and nose are very securely fastened (he chews everything right now). I'm very pleased with my purchase, and I think my son is, too."
4,Elmo's a hit!,"My 7-yr old daughter has developed a recent obsession with Elmo. His fur is very soft and he is well-made, which is typical of the GUND standard. Elmo is now her constant companion. My daughter's only complaint is that Elmo's eyes are made of very hard plastic. While durable, they do not make for a comfortable snuggle at night. Overall, this has been a great purchase."
2,Very Dissapointed !,"After reviewing several Sesame Street Elmo`s I picked this one because it was made by Gund. So dissapointed, PLUSH is not how I would describe it; more like scrawny.."
1,Gund Sesame Street Elmo 13' Plush,"The product arrived looking different than the photo. The mouth is totally open forcing the head back. There are no hands aspictured. I would have returned this product, but it would require being sent to China.Gund Sesame Street Elmo 13'"
4,Not quite true red color,"My daughter LOOOOOOVES this toy and that's what counts. But I didn't quite like the color of this Elmo, as it's not quite true red. Slightly orangy, pink-red. Just not brick red.But it's a perfect size and it goes perfect with herGund Grover."
4,Plush Elmo,This Elmo is super soft and a wonderful addition to my sons huge Sesame Street collection. He LOVES him!
4,"A nice, soft stuffed animal - without the bells and whistles, please!","I wanted to get my daughter a stuffed Elmo because she recently has started to love Sesame Street. I went to all of the stores in town, and could only find ones that laugh, sing, speak your name, dance, etc...All I really wanted was a basic nice looking stuffed animal - like I used to have. This one fits the bill. It's very soft and a good size for my 2 year old. We are very pleased with our purchase!!"
2,"Sun faded Elmo, but it's still Elmo","I was a bit disappointed with this elmo. I searched and searched for the right one and based on all the reviews, I got this one. It's much smaller than I expected and it's NOT a RED elmo, it's more like a sun faded red. My daughter LOVES Elmo, so she took to it right away, but it looks like it's old and faded. I was expecting a deeper red color (like the ones that move - tmx elmo) But if you don't mind the color difference, then it's fine. It is very soft and plush, so that's nice. Otherwise, not what I was hoping for."
4,Stuffed Elmo,I was pleased with this Elmo. The coloring was perfect and the size was a good size for my 3 yr. old to carry around with her. She sleeps with him at night.
4,Great elmo for the price,"I bought it for my son's 2nd bday. I did not want somethign too huge that takes up space, this is good, a tad on the smaller size. I did not have any trouble with stray fur as some of the other reviewers did. It is not out of this world, but it does the job. My son loves it. I have seen a ""tickle me elmo"" that has an annoying sound, I am happy I bought this one."
5,A Visual History,This book should be in all school libraries. The excellent illustrations bring the accurate text to life in a compelling way. I give 2-3 hr presentations in French or English as a voyageur. This book certainly covers more than I can in such a way. I would recommend it whole-heartedly as background for anyone interested in the period and the characters.
1,Lenin is the only charlatan equal to Marx,"Here in Brazil, I tried to read this small trash-book, translated to the Portuguese. Writen a short time after Lenin(1970-1924) ordered the genocide of more than 30,000,000 Christians, this trash book is full of praze for this charlatan, syphillitic and genocidal called Lenin. Please, Lenin is the only charlatan equal to Marx.Today, Marxism is just another name for Patrimonialism and Populism."
3,Not as different as a newer edition should be,"I have two ""Clanbook: Tremere"" books -- one is the 1994/98 edition and one is this 2000 edition. While the feeling of the book is different as one reviewer states because it is told from a different viewpoint, the facts, the information, and the descriptions are pretty much the same. In terms of new paths and new rituals, I found ""Blood Magic"" and ""Guide to the Camarilla"" more informative. I think the new view of this book follows very neatly into the overall changes in the tone of the game books. Something very useful are the examples of character design and info on how to fit a ""Mind's Eye Theater"" player into a table-top game or the reverse. Frankly, our game is a bit of both -- I have had some really really great players/actors so it gives me reason to continue collecting and reading the books for this game. I just feel a bit like this one wasted some of my money because so much is a repeat."
4,Night life takes off,An interesting book with great insight into the Tremere Clan. A must have for all who play Tremere
1,I'm giving my copy away,"Some good scenes, but nothing really stands out. Kelly Monaco doesn't get enough screen time."
4,Good stuff,"Katalina Verdin has a sexy video at the beginning.But, Jaime Bergman steals the show for me in a great pre-wedding scene."
2,Sizing,Good prodcut and photo is of the actual product. Be careful it is the new style measurements where a size 16 is a 2X.
3,"Outstanding film, disappointing transfer to DVD","I've got no complaints about the film itself or the supplementary material (Tyrone Power bio and commentary during the film), but the transfer itself is mediocre. There seems to be a lot of flickering (due to compression artifacts?) -- for example, in the grill at the back of the room from 3:31-3:37 and in the metallic ""decorations"" on the soldiers' chests from 4:34-4:43. Fox didn't seem to have the same problems with The Song of Bernadette, another B&W movie which is almost 60% longer than this one."
2,LOUSY TRANSFER RUINS A POWERFUL PERFORMANCE!,"""The Mark of Zorro"" is the most memorable of the Zorro films made about the black masked crusader, fighting for the people and against the injustices of corrupt political officials. Zorro (Tyrone Power) must stop Captain Pasquale (Basil Rathbone) from destroying Los Angeles by robbing its citizenry while he romances his gorgeous niece (Linda Darnell).TRANSFER: Just awful! Though the original elements were in pretty bad shape, Fox has managed to restore much of the luster of the original camera negative. There are age related artifacts, but the real problem here is the edge enhancement and aliasing and shimmering of fine details that are present in EVERY SINGLE FRAME of this disc! The audio is remastered in stereo and nicely presented for its age.EXTRAS: Only a bio on Tyrone Power and an audio commentary by Richard Schickel.BOTTOM LINE: A thrilling story and wonderful performances ruined by a shoddy transfer. NO to ""The Mark of Zorro""."
5,It was actually nice to see real people in a real sword fight.,"I gave this DVD to my wife on Valentines Day. She has always been a big fan of Tyrone Power. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised. The action, and the story, was very mundane by today's standards. We are so brainwashed by movies that show the hero turning triple flips in the air while using his sword to flick buttons off of the bad guy's jacket that we forget what real people are really like. Although this movie was much tamer than today's special effects movies, it was also more realistic and quite nice to see actors of yesteryear that didn't need all those special effects.The colors were not as bright as movies that are shot in color but it was a good job and looked good. This movie is a treat that we will enjoy for some time."
4,I liked it....,"Very good colorization of a classic movie. I haven't viewed the Black & White version yet, but it's convienent to have the choice of one disc. Of course, my favorite version of the Zorro legend is George Hamilton's ""Zorro, the Gay Blade""."
3,o well,o well it was the best you can do . the sound is with stadic and with all my effort to clean it . wel that the best i can do . ART
4,"""No Wonder You Chose the Church!""","exclaims Basil Rathbone when he gets a peek into all the loot that's in the coffers he's stealing from Father Eugene Pallette. But of course what he doesn't know is that it was all just put in there by Zorro aka Tyrone Power. ""The Mark of Zorro"" is a very entertaining romp in old California, when the Spanish nobles still had a lot of sway. Basil Rathbone is simply wonderful as the fencing master who takes an instant dislike to Diego, Tyrone Power's true identity. That's because Gale Sondergaard, heretofore Rathbone's mistress, is now casting glances at Power, who is pretending to be something of a sissy. This is disgusting to senorita Linda Darnell, who respects a Real Hombre, like Zorro. Power is drawn to her, not Sondergaard, but romance has to take a second seat to righting some wrongs. Really great duelling scenes, and some pretty advanced dialogue about an analogy between fruit and Diego make for a picture worth seeing."
1,Do your part to preserve our cinema heritage!,"...by not buying Fox's idiotic attempt to colorize one of the great screen classics. Yikes, will they NEVER learn?!?!?"
4,GOOD but need more INFORMATION,THE MARK OF ZORRO is a better interesting book. Zorro is always fighting for the peoples rights. HE is in love with this woman MS. Lolita. But in order to get her love he needs to fight and for her love. I do recommender but it needs more details.
3,After all this time - disappointed,"I'm sorry to say, that Fox classics did little if anything to restore or enhance the print on the DVD. There are still marks, smudges, etc on the print.They have commentary by a film critic, and a biography on Tyrone Power that was on A&E. Big deal.If you're a real fan of this film (the duel between Power and Basil Rathbone is worth having if nothing else), certainly buy this.Just don't expect anything special."
5,Great for the grandchildren,"I have grandchildren from 3 sets of parents and each has different standards for what their kids are allowed to watch on TV. When all the grandkids spend the night, it is difficult to find programs that meet all the standards. I have found that many DVDs of movies from the 1930s and 1940s meet the standards and are still fun for kids aged 10/13. Mark of Zorro is an exciting drama with romance, but no sex, and just mild violence. The grandkids loved it and the parents found nothing objectionable."
4,"Powerful, Dark and Edgy","Robinson's psychologically intense novel pulls you into a world of mystery, family heartache and fragmentation, and the magic of nature and spirit. Is she hinting at Shamanistc rites with LisaMarie's abilities to interact with the magic little man who foretells the future? The Crows who speak to her as well as the dreams she learns to understand? Through the deft use of narrative shift, weaving her way back and forth through time, Robinson takes us on a journey of the human spirit seeking redemption and healing.This novel brings one to the brink of despair and back again, tantilizing us with hope while scouring cultural politics with the broken language and narrative take expresing the marginalization of the Haislan People. The magic of Elvis, Sasquatch, and Language makes this a novel of intensely bewildering power. Quite reminiscent of Beloved and Ceremony, Robinson leaves the reader haunted and gasping at the same time."
1,Not for me,"I came to this book via a reference in Christopher Bracken's "" Magical Criticism"", and truthfully, it may have supported his thesis, but for me, I couldn't get through it. It was the style, and also the coming of age plot that bogged me down. I can only describe the style as Dick and Jane plain. I couldn't relate to anything in the plot, sorry. The magic and dreaminess were there, but too weak for me. What can I say, I like the magic and dreaminess in Proust. This book seemed shallow. I don't mean to detract from the seriousness of the author, my apologies."
3,"Good writing, but not really a ""novel""","This book is entertaining and well-written, but it's not really a ""novel."" To me, a ""novel"" requires a plot with a climax, whereas Monkey Beach really has no discernible ending. I got to the end of the book, and regretfully thought ""that's it?""While it's well-written and engrossing, don't expect a resolution. My advice is to read this expecting a series of loosely-intertwined short stories that pleasingly meander through the main characters' lives. If you enjoy that style of writing, this book will be well worth your time. If, like me, you prefer your fiction to conclude with some sort of resolution, then I'd say move on to a different work."
4,Strange beauty that creeps up slowly,"While the opening was slow to grab my attention because of the sometimes-confusing movement through time, I'm glad I stuck with this book. Haisla author Eden Robinson depicts life for a First Nations community in the mid- to late-eighties in British Columbia, without sentimentality. Protagonist Lisa Hill experiences her coming of age in an indigenous community still reeling from past traumas. Lisa learns how to use her own gifts while also working to navigate young adulthood, flashbacks interwoven with the present-tense narrative that opens the book and brings us Lisa's immediate concern: her brother is lost at sea. This is a dark and mysterious novel, a funny novel, and one unlike any other I've seen emerge from Native literature. If you pick it up, be patient with the opening, and you will be greatly rewarded."
2,Not what I expected...,"I stopped reading this book around page 80. There really was no plot structure, and I could not read it any longer. It was just an episodic look at some girl's life and some of her experiences, but not connected. I really liked some of Eden Robinson's nasty short stories, and I guess I was hoping for this book to be similar in terms of gothic, but I was definitely wrong."
3,Cold austerity !,"I am still wondering what was the purpose of The Great Goebel in recording this music. First, we have to endure ten minutes of the most annoying pieces Musica Antiqua Koln have ever recorded. Even the viola da gamba sound like clear violins. And then, the noisy trompete of Albrici ring brutally the bell in a flamboyant and majestic sonata ! Than again, an episode of cold darkness. We have to wait for the sonatas of Becker and especially the sonata of Meder to open our eyes. The latter is remarkable. A crescendo full of diversity and surprises ! This sonata is so attractive and so powerfull! A masterpiece to dicover. The musicians are phenomenal ! The sound is deep and rich.An other Cd of Goebel that let me perplexeed ! Too perplexed !On the whole, I was deceived. Too disoriented and dark. Trully you'll find cold darkness there.Be prudent ! It'chilly but well done."
4,Daughter Loves It!,"My three year-old daughter loves this toy. We took most of the small pieces out of the box(for obvious reasons)and let her play with the Barbie and the babies. She takes such tender care of ""her"" babies now. She wraps them in their blankets and rocks them in the medical cribs that come with the set.Overall, this is a fun toy for youngsters. As is with most Barbie dolls, there are gobs of small pieces. Keep that and the age of your child in mind when purchasing this toy."
1,Missing Babies,"I bought the product for my daughter for Christmas. She loves the barbie babies and I thought she would be thrilled with the girl and boy twins. Unfortunately, the product arrived with no barbie babies. Now, I have to return the item and wait for a refund."
4,Barbie Doctor in the House?,Good overall fun. My daughter loves Barbies. She is graduating to the My Scene Barbies and Bratz but still loves to role play with all her barbies. And they never get enough....
5,Very cute,A very cute toy. As soon as I saw it I wanted it. I love the tiny babies that Dr. Barbie has to take care of. I plan to be a neonatalogist when I am older and Barbie gives me an idea of the job. This toy has very cute babies and their own Docter!! This has fun that never stops.
2,My 3 year old wasn't interested in this doll at all,"I was about to have my second child when I purchased the Midge doll, the Alan and Ryan dolls, and this one for my 3 year old. I thought it would be good for her to be able to control a family and do some role play with them in regard to having a new baby. She was totally interested in Midge (not so much the pregnant belly, but the hair). Midge has knockout hair. Alan and Ryan were used as escorts for the Kelly and Barbie dolls my daughter already had. But, this baby doctor doll wasn't even noticed. It's been 4 months. Still, she doesn't play with it. Maybe it's just a matter of overkill. She was bombarded with dolls just before her baby sister arrived. Just thought I'd share our experience. Best wishes."
3,BABY NURSE,THIS TOY IS 3 STARS FUN. THE EDUCATION VALUE IS 3 STARS. DURABILITY OF THIS TOY IS 3 STARS. I CALL THIS TOY ''BABY NURSE''. YOU CAN PRETEND SHE IS A REAL NURSE TAKING CARE OF REAL BABIES. YOU MIGHT NEVER GET TIRED OF PLAYING WITH HER. OR THE BABIES.
2,very disappointed,I am deeply disappointed to see the gratuitous use of bottles for feeding babies. Although it may be believed to be difficult to produce a breastfeeding doll I feel that the promotion of bottle feeding to young impressionable children is detrimental to their understanding of the best way to feed a baby.
2,"Not the best book, and there is an updated version available","Amazon is not so great about removing older versions of books and this is one example - if you are going to buy it, get the 2006 version. Now, about the 1999 version....I will agree that it is helpful for driving through the park, but it's only good if you are traveling in the direction she has written it in. For example, if you are traveling a particular leg from north to south but she has written the guide traveling south to north, it is really difficult to follow. The book Yellowstone Treasures by Janet Chapple is written with mile markers regardless of which direction you are traveling in, so I recommend it over this one. Chapple's book is also more comprehensive."
3,Scenic Driving Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park,The book is just okay in my opinion. It is not very specific and doesn't offer much more information than can be obtained through the Park Service. This is not one of the better books as compared to the other series guides.
4,Extremely Detailed,"Extremely Detailed, to detailed for me. It had a lot of reading and did not get down to the point on where, what and when. If your looking for lots of detail and history of everything about the park this book is for you. If your like me and time is limited you may want to look for a different book. But if you got all the time in the world or you want to know it all this is the book for you."
5,A great read,"Soloviev, a brilliant Russian Orthodox philosopher of the late 19th century, covers a lot of ground in this little book. Love is held up as the shatterer of egoism and the means by which an individual becomes a bearer of the ""all-unity"" of the cosmos, gathering together all the elements of the world together within himself and thereby becoming an absolutely unique, absolutely irreplaceable, ""absolutely significant"" individual who transcends the laws of nature and triumphs over the forces of decay and death. For anyone who suspects that love is about more than just blind sexual instinct, or economics, or anything less than insight into the heart of reality, this book simply can't be passed up. Even if you end up not agreeing with everything here, you'll no doubt be moved by the beauty of the cosmic vision of love he presents."
5,yes!,"So much beauty here. I love the point woven throughout the book, that the evolutionary development of rational self-consciousness - which is the precondition for egoism, the valuation of oneself as THE center of importance - was itself a precondition for the capacity to recognize (and justify with deeds) that same significance in others, i.e. to love. And that this rationality was more or less handed to us by nature, but that it has been left up to us whether or not we choose to love."
1,poor quality,"The Ear piece(the wrap around, not the gel pads) is extremely flimsy. The gel pads are also awkward shapes making it hard to get it to stay in your ear. Even when i was able to make it stay in place, it was not that comfortable.The sound quality is not very good at all, but you can't expect much from such a small and cheap speaker.The speaker actually came apart from the main unit only after having it two days.Yes, it's cheap in price, but also in quality."
5,Works Great with Nextel,"We needed some headsets for work but the problem was that bluetooth does not work with the push-to-talk (PTT) function on our work nextels. I ordered 3 of these to try out and the sound quality was great, comfort was great and the versatility to wear them different ways suited all of our workers.Since the price is so low I ordered 20 more to have extras on hand and they can just be throw away devices when they break. Just wished they had a set shipping that was lower when you order 20 but still cheap anyway."
2,"Not good for the soft-spoken, or the extended talker","I've got a very soft voice, so generally have to pick earpieces that pick up a lot. I was replacing aPlantronics mx150 Verizon wired Hands-Free w/ call end, answer & Voice Dialingthat I'd had for about 3 years. I chose this thinking it was going to be as good. Unfortunately, no one could hear me on it.As far as in the ear comfort goes, I thought it was going to be better than the under the lobe support. I normally talk for hours in the evening and I was getting a little bothered by the original one. Unfortunately, this was less comfortable, and I felt like I was getting an earache after a few days of using it. I tried to use the over the ear support but the little connector snapped the first time I tried to connect it. (And yes, I was trying to be careful.) Switching ears was a pain as well since you had to line up the inner part with the boom.Personally, I trashed this and bought another of the Plantronics when I upgraded my phone last month."
3,Missing earpiece,I bought this product based on the picture. I recieved this product with only molded earpieces and they do not fit. I was expecting the headset that slips around the ear.
2,A let-down,"Jabra C150 Headset for 2.5mm Universal Headset PlugShould've researched further: although the data sheet mentions ""Call answer/End"" button, and the picture shows it, it does not work (at least with my Samsung phone). I used to have a headset like that and liked it a lot, until it broke; this I bought as a replacement and was really disappointed. The original one had 4 contact bands on the 2.5 mm plug, but the picture does not show the plug! (And there is not way to comment that picture is not showing enough details - Amazon, are you listening?)"
1,"sound quality good, build quality very bad","sound quality is great, but wires are super thin and weak. plastic is thin.jabra has designed these to fail. it will last just over a month. i guess they expect everyone to buy 6 per year.i have purchased several and all have broken even being really careful. the ear piece may pull out the speaker and snap the wire. the plug that connects to the phone may break internally rendering the speaker or mic non-functional."
2,Lacking durability,"After a couple months of use, the earpiece had separated from the main body its internal wiring became disconnected. The device was no longer functional. I would recommend a more durable headset."
3,"Good sound, but fragile","Purchased this from SF Planet, appears to be OEM (despite arriving without sealed packaging and instructions). The headset itself sounds great, and the molded earpieces fit nicely. Beware of durability -- when pulling it out of my ear, I've had a few instances where the earpiece detaches slightly, revealing the wiring inside! After gently pushing it back on, the headset seems to be OK... for now. The price point (seven bucks in 2007) is probably appropriate for its questionable durability. What tips the balance to ""Worth buying"" is the comfortable fit and sound quality."
3,"Good, but no volumn control...",I have a Samsung phone and the digital volumn control is either too loud or too soft using this headset. The headset would be better if it has a volumn control.
2,Was nice while it worked,"This product was nice when it worked; I especially liked the comfort of the earbuds. However, it stopped working after a few months."
1,Don't Bother with this Seller,This was not the item I ordered. Sent 2 emails requesting help. NO response. Went to local electronics store and purchased right item. They never had the courtesy to respond.
2,Very Uncomfortable,"The diameter of the piece that sits in your ear is huge with the attached disposable covers. I didn't think I had small ear canals, but this was painful after a few minutes. The sound was acceptable for the price. I removed the plastic cover and it fit much better, but the edges are not smooth and intended for usage without the covers. I also purchased a Plantronics version and am much happier with that one. Same price point. I threw out this one."
1,Couldn't hear anything,I think the microphone on this was broken. I could hear people but no one could hear me. It was cheap so I didn't bother trying to return it. You get what you pay for.
1,Peace of Junk,"The ear peaces are too big for the average ear. The over-ear hook is not sufficient enough to keep the ear peace close to the ear. Over all it feels cheap, and I found them non-functional.Do not waste your money!"
1,defective and possibly used product,"Received item relatively quickly. It was packaged in a ziplock type bag and appeared used. Tested with cell phone, microphone worked but could not hear the caller at all, the earphone seems defective. Disappointed with purchase and returning."
1,THIS IS NOT WHAT I ORDERED,THIS IS NOT WHAT I ORDERED THE PLUG IS TO SMALL FOR ANYTHING AND THERE IS NO CUSHION...I WANT A REFUND... THIS IS NOT WAT I ORDERED
2,NOT what was pictured,"Item sent was not what was pictured. Specifically wanted headset with the hook to go around the ear. Picture showed this type of headset. Instead, I received headset that was ear buds only. Price was too inexspensive to send back."
1,The product is a piece of junk,"This must set a record for the fastest time to demise of a product. I received the package (well-wrapped) in the mail about three minutes ago. I opened up the bubble wrap to find the headset in a little plastic bag. I reached in to the plastic bag to pull the headset out, when the silicone caught on the corner of the plastic bag. I was pulling it out of the bag with two fingers reaching into a plastic bag, and the head assembly ripped off. I don't know if it was defective to begin with, but in all fairness to the seller it tore in my hands so I am not going to raise a stink about it. This is a useless piece of plastic that went from postal envelope to trash in about fifteen seconds when I realized what I had done.Also be warned that the image is misleading. It came with only one silicone attachment."
1,I will never buy this ear piece again!!,"The delivery was fast, but as soon as I received this ear piece, I was VERY disappointed!The ear piece in the picture is NOT the ear piece that was sent to me via mail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The piece that actually goes into your ear was a long, clear, rubber attachment piece, which was very hard to place into my ear canal. Also, there was no over the ear piece, which the picture clearly shows the headset having a plastic piece that goes over your ear's cartilage.The quality of the ear piece I also received was absolutely horrible. I hadn't even made the first phone call with it yet and the piece that goes inside of my ear canal broke apart and the wires snapped. I will never buy this product again! It was a waste of my time and money!"
3,OK. Good sound but not too comfortable.,Bought 3 and use them without the molded ear pieces. Nice and loud. Mic is good too. Just not too comfy for my ear.
3,No button on this headset,"Contrary to the description, there is no button. Otherwise it is a nice headset. Good sound quality and comfortable to wear."
1,"Comfortable for a while, pretty bad sound quality","I bought this for $30 from Best Buy. What a waste of money!The ear gels are comfortable at first, but after an hour or so, your ear starts to really hurt from it.The sound quality is TERRIBLE! People I am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud, even on the lowest volume setting on my Motorola v300.What is worse, people I am talking to hear me very poorly. They say there is so much background noise it sounds like I am in a noisy bar, even when I'm just sitting in my car. People can barely hear me over the background noise racket."
4,Overview of the Zen masters,"A complete overview of the Zen masters, wonderfully written, and definately worth it. Dr. Wu is very insightful and was friends with Lin Yutang. The preface may mention christianity but the meat of the book is an excellent overview, insightful. One of my favorite books in my large zen/dao collection."
2,A Christian view of Zen,"I was disappointed to discover that the man who wrote this book is not a Zen Buddhist, but a Christian. Though he is a Chinese scholar of Zen, it seems his understanding is filtered through his relationship with Christianity, hence the long forward by the author's good friend Thomas Merton trying to show some similarities between Zen and Christianity. I suppose this would have been a great book to have when it was published 40 years ago or so, but really there are so many better books available now which show a greater understanding and realization of Zen practice than this one. I would spend your money elsewhere."
2,"Nice artwork, but So-So Story","Our family loves other Waldorf-style children's books by Elsa Beskow, Sibylle Von Olfers and the like, but I was disappointed in this book. The artwork is beautiful, in the Waldorf style, but the language was not as beautiful by far. The story is nothing like those rich tales Elsa Beskow wrote. Instead the story is simple - one after another the animals try to wake Winter until finally he awakens to the ladybug's whisper. Lots of build-up and then I felt let down by the language of his awakening and the abrupt end to the story. Simple stories can be good, they can be great - but this author used lots of language, which was at times awkward, to share the simple tale. Wordy and not compelling.By the way, the first animal to try to waken Winter is a group of snakes. They writhe on top of Winter's sleeping body to try to waken him. NOT an image I want to bring to my children!"
3,Reasons for skepticism about Cohen's criticisms.,"I don't want to do a thorough review of content. I just want to show why you should be very skeptical about this book:The phrase ""self-ownership"" appears on 217 different pages in Cohen's critique of Nozick.The phrase ""self-ownership"" appears exactly once in Nozick's book, on p. 172.Hmmm...Every political philosopher should read this book, but they owe it to themselves to take Nozick seriously. Try as he might, Cohen fails to do so. If you're interested in a basically knock-down response to Cohen, check out Eric Mack's ""Self-Ownership, Marxism, and Egalitarianism"", parts I and II, in the journal Politics, Philosophy, and Economics."
5,Another brilliant piece of work by Cohen,"Cohen does it again. In a work that defies brief summary, Prof. Cohen's arguments have sound logic, are truly provocative, and have profound normative implications. Few political theorists, especially if marxist, have such an admirable combination of analytical power and deep respect for the integrity of normative theory. Political philosophy at its best."
3,Less interesting AFI music,"This ep is good, but the three songs that are from Black Sails in the Sunset are the same as the album versions and aren't even the best songs from the album. Who Knew is a good song, but it's over-rated. It has it's good points, but mainly sounds just like The Boy Who Destroyed the World, and it sounds even more like Sacrifice Theory. You probably shouldn't waste your money just for one song. You should, however, buy all of their other albums. They're worth the price."
1,Restaurant Background Music,"I've loved Roberto Carlos since 1973, but this album is a sorry step backward. Each track seems just like the others, slow, minimalist melodies, and fluffy sentiment. You'll get more enjoyment for your dollars on other albums."
4,great cd,animal chin is a great band with very melodic vocals in all of there songs...the only reason i give this cd 4 stars is thae fact that half of the songs are on the other cd of theirs which i also have....those 6 songs are great ..it just gets repetitive scince i have both.
3,somewhat poor replacement for a D400Zoom,"Our venerable Olympus D-400Zoom was stolen (1.3MP, 4AA batteries and $700 5 years ago) and we received a $200 credit towards a replacement from the insurance company. This seemed the closest equivalent for less -- 2MP, 2AA batteries and lighter with USB instead of a pokey slow serial connection. All is well except of 2 major and 1 minor annoyances you'd think they would have fixed 5 years later:- the flash pops out always and can't be pushed back in when the camera is taking pictures (you can hold it back in, but that's awkward)- the flash recharges slower than it did on the D400Zoom- the picture quality setting is not ""sticky"" -- each time you power on the camera, the quality setting changes back to High Quality which is not necessary most of the time as we put our pictures on webpages primarilyThat said, the refurbished camera for $145 was a bargain for this camera and we'll learn to live with the annoyances for now!"
3,Good General Introduction to Condoleezza Rice,"For the general reader, this is a good general introduction to the life and career of Condoleezza Rice. But it is more a summary of facts than anything else--I would have liked to see a more thoughtful account that included some additional context about her life and ideas.Regardless of one's politics, everyone who reads this short biography will be inspired by looking at what Secretary Rice has accomplished in her life, and by seeing the excellence of her character."
4,A good read,An easy and interesting story and insight into how she was able to reach her potential with parents who wanted nothing but the best for their daughter.
3,Public Relations 101,"I read the book with both admiration and agitation. I admire Dr. Rice's accomplishments. She's definitely not your average American, black or white, male or female. But the book was written to convince the American public that she is a reputable and capable presence in the White House, a ""testing of the waters"" to see if the public will consider her on a Presidential ticket. While Dr. Rice has accomplished much, her contributions to the human public have been just as orchestrated as her formal education.The author's style will keep a middle school reader entertained(My 11 year old is reading it now). But the entire book reads like an advertising brochure. I suspect in 50 years, Dr. Rice will be canonized!"
2,Disappointing,"I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed in this book. Being an admirer of Condoleeza Rice, I was really looking forward to reading her life story. However the book reads more like a very very long and protracted resume rather than a story about someone's life. I think I expected to learn more about Dr Rice the person, rather than all the political accomplishments. For me, (and perhaps many others who like biographies/ autobiographies) reading stories about people, how they think, how they approach life, their dreams, their joys and sorrows and of course their accomplishments has always been inspirational. One gets the sense however, that the author of this book does not really know Dr Rice and writes about her ""from a distance"" per say. I guess I'll just have to wait for the autobiography."
3,Interesting book,"This is an interesting book to read. Unfortunately, I could only rate at 3 stars becasue I read this book immediately after reading the memoirs of Pope John Paul II. This story described how well loved Dr. Rice was by her parents and how supportive they were of her. I truly believe that Dr. Rice is an attractive, highly intelligent and hard working person, but the author did not capture the true beauty of Dr. Rice thinkink and feeling to the readers."
1,The progress of a token,"It is amazing to me how someone of her background by being in Birmingham during the bombing and knowing at least one of the girl victims could be so insensitive to the plight of black people in this country. One of the main weaknesses of this book is that the author never interviewed her. Condolezza has been very careful not to say anything on race by concentrating only on foreign affairs she thinks she has removed herself from the national scene which is imposssible in D.C. It is also notworthy that her major promotions have come from the Conservatives from her time at Stamford, the Hoover Institute and the Bushs who are using her very effectively against any progressive politicians. Her pathetic image is one of a lonely woman who has no social life other than to spend her weekends with Pres.Bush and his family says a great deal about her lost of self."
2,Condi boasts too much,Although an accurate biographical summary of an important figure today the book lacks a fair treatment of the importance of terrorism. An intelligent person perfectly suited for terrorism from the post Soviet countries but not the Middle East menace which we confront today. I didn't feel secure before 9/11 with Condi as N.S.A. and now most of the experience she gains will be on the job at a cost to how many more people being victims. Address the issue of Palestine to end terrorism against Americans Jews and the disenfranchised. Read the book and decide!AJ FAL
2,Didnt really do anything,"I give it 2 stars because i'm sure it would whiten if my teeth were darkened by coffee or other black things, but mine are just a little bit yellow and thus this product had no effect on my teeth"
3,Doesn't seem to work,"My dentist recommended this whitening gel specifically because I have sensitive teeth to whitening agents. The one positive is that my teeth were not sensitive to this gel. On the flip-side, I don't think the sensitive teeth formula works very well (yes I followed the directions). My teeth don't look any whiter and I've been using it for 2 weeks."
3,NICE LOOKING....,I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY DODGE TRUCK. LOOKS OKAY. NOT WHAT I WANTED. YOU MAY LIKE IT.
4,The Roots Of Trout,"Walter Trout has been a fixture on the electric-blues scene for years, but many of his later albums are inconsistent. The playing is always vintage Trout, but on virtually everything in the last decade there are peaks and valleys. If you never heard the original Walter Trout Band lineup on ""Telin' Stories"", you have missed the genesis of the artist. It's the cradle of his rock, and this CD kicks from beginning to end. Each song is completely different from the next, and there's no gristle in this meat. Solid blues with power and believability, opening to closing. HIGHLY recommended. I'd actually rate this 4 1/2 stars but haven't figured out how to do that!"
2,"Good songs, TERRIBLE sound","Please understand that the meagerly two stars does not reflect the quality of the music itself. The songs are good--the material on this album ranks among Trout's finest, I think--but the sound quality is TERRIBLE!!!I was in disbelief when I looked on the credits and saw that three or four people were actually involved in the production and engineering of this album. I literally thought at first that Trout and his band had recorded this themselves home-made. It makes my stereo sound like a transistor radio--some songs don't even sound like they were recorded in stereo! No bass--and too much blasted high end! (his guitar tone has too much of that tinny high end on some of his other albums, too.) Given that this album was recorded only about ten years ago, it's inexcusable to release a CD of this quality, sound-wise.I'm glad Walter came back with more releases later that apparently utilized technology invented in the last forty years!"
2,Boring Blues,"If Walter Trout Band is Tellin' Stories, it must be stories that have already been told a thousand times before.There is nothing new, nothing smashing about this album. Every single song is one big cliché. It's decent blues, all right, but it's not worth listening to on your stereo. Go to a concert instead.The exception is the rock'n'roll track Tremble which has something. But even on this one, Walter Trout Band is mainly a band of workmanship, not a band of creativity!"
4,Agree with hartigan but......,"this may sound like whining, but the playing is a bit too intense. The guy ""never comes up for air"", but neither can the listener. I find I can only take a few tracks at a time before I'm yearning for just one long clean sustained note to give my ears and brain a rest. No subtlety here that's for sure, but can he ever play."
5,Entertaining Read for any age,I really enjoyed this book. I have read many books on cats and this is just about the best one. Informative yet entertaining when reading it. You will understand you cat better and have fun doing it. Very well written on a level for both young and old and not boring anyone.
2,Inaccurate and Misleading!,"My son brought this book home from his school library and I thought it sounded cute, so we began reading it together before bedtime one evening. At just about every page, I had to stop and say ""Well, our cats are not like that"" or ""that doesn't sound right"". My 7 year old son even agreed. The author insinuates things about cats that frankly are just not true, such as they are antisocial and do not vocalize unless they are demanding something from you. I own three cats and am under no false belief that my cats worship me. However, the implied opposite notions implied in this book I do not believe are true either. I will confess I did not finish this book (because of the mis-truths), so I can't speak for the information in the last half. I was so perturbed at the inaccuracies in the book though, that I felt more folks know before they invested in it."
5,Cute for all ages,This book tells how to interact with your cat. It is a very cute story that I enjoyed along with my family.
3,Disappointing,"If you are looking for a reproduction of the TV broadcast, you'll be disappointed. One of the biggest omissions is the musical guest montages...one of the reasons I bought the video. What is on the tape is good, but just not enough of the broadcast. If you want the entire TV broadcast, find a friend who taped it."
