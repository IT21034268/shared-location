3,wrong order,"Don't get me wrong, I have been a Foreigner fan since I bought the Foreigner 4 album, but this CD is dissappointing because of the order of the songs. It just doesn't make sense. The songs should have been in chronological order, leaving the new songs for last. That way if you didn't like the new songs you could just stop the CD."
3,one of the greatest bands of all time.,"for those of you who may or may not know, foreigner was put together on the basis of mick jones departing from the band spooky tooth, which also consisted of gary wright who had the hits ""dream weaver"" & ""love is alive"" as a solo artist. mick jones along with lou gramm started in my oppinion, one of the most well oiled music machines in rock n' roll WITH foreigner. and as we all very well know, churned out hits left right and sideways. radio was even playing stuff from the albums that weren't hits but became radio staples. this collection is good BUT, it just doesn't cover all the basis. again in my opinion, i think either the two disc anthology set or the single disc from rhino would be the best way to go for a compilation package. me, i would rather own the individual albums. either way you go, you just can't beat the greatness of the ""juke box heros"""
4,Classic rock and roll,"This album hits with its hits, but misses with the newer songs. The best songs on the album are the Foreigner songs we grew up with and know best - ""Juke Box Hero,"" ""Head Games,"" ""Waiting for a Girl Like You,"" ""Feels Like the First Time,"" and ""Urgent.""It's nice to see ""I Want to Know What Love Is,"" ""Say You Will"", ""That Was Yesterday,"" and ""I Don't Want to Live Without You"" on the album as well.""Soul Doctor,"" ""Prisoner of Love,"" and ""With Heaven on Our Side"" I could have been just fine without."
5,It's great.,"This is a great album with all their hits. I especially like ""Prisoner of Love"" also. Great track. Go get it."
3,"not as good as I hoped, but not bad nonetheless","The best songs are the 3 big ones, the rest are just space-fillers"
1,LED ZEPPELIN ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THIS,"I REALLY,REALLY HATE FOREIGNER AND I RANK THEM AS BAD AS GREEN DAY.DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS DISGUSTINGLY AWFUL CD WHICH CONTAINS TRASH LIKE WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU WHICH HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST MORONIC AND STUPID SONGS EVER.GET ANY LED ZEPPELIN ALBUM INSTEAD."
1,"Battery is wrong, this is garbage","FOREIGNER IS THE WORST OF THE WORST.THEY ARE EVEN MORE WORSE THAN GREEN DAY.EACH AND EVERY SONG AND ALBUM OF THEIR SUCKS.WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU IS THE MOST IDIOTIC SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD.DONT LISTEN TO THE REVIEWER BELOW ME WHO IS AN ALIAS OF WHIRLIGIG FROM BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA.BUY ANY CD FROM ICONS LIKE LED ZEPPELIN,PINK FLOYD,THE ROLLING STONES,QUEEN AND AC/DC INSTEAD."
1,corporate rock sludge,"This band probably rivals Styx as the worst band of all time. I think anybody still listening to this drivel needs to let their tastes evolve. Don't buy any CD's from these guys. The music is awful, the group stinks, good thing these guys aren't around anymore, or are they?"
5,Abs pilates,"Great video and results are soon visible in the abs if the video is used every other day. Great DVD, worth purchasing!!!"
5,rock & roll memories,"When I first heard Ike & Tina Turner on loudspeakers at a high school pool party, the hair on the back of my neck raised to the song ""A fool in love"". I could not find the original until I received this cd. Great memories!"
5,A Voice to be Remembered,"""A Forgotten Voice"" is not just one more ""I've got to read this because I should"" biography. Dr. Klein has woven the threads of Leta Hollingworth's life and the strands of educational philosophy (both past and present) into a cloak well worth the trying on. I highly recommend this volume to anyone with an interest in gifted education/psychology and/or the lives of influential women. You will not be disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this book for a school project and was I was very pleased when it arrived so quickly (even if I had payed the extra). At first glance, the book looks to be in almost new condition, but then I started reading it and the pages are falling out of the glued binding at every turn of a page! I am very disappointed because I was hoping to keep it in my collection after the project was finished, but if it continues to fall apart I might as well throw it away. It is just not holding up very well. I guess I will stick to ordering all of my books to my Kindle. They just don't make them like they used to.."
1,Don't Bother,"This was not a very good book on the subject. Quite frankly I was pretty disappointed. Most projects are crude and show very little imagination. The instructions are useless and even the novice will not benefit from the information in this book. Don't waste your money, move on. I'm returning mine."
3,ed's book1,i am reading all of his books. this is my first one on my kindle and are about a quarter of the way through it. i like to read about things of the world war ll era. i really like how soon you're into the storyline.i also like the books with sean dillon in them. i like how this book is progressing because it makes me want to see how the main figure gets out of all those situations he gets into.
2,Not the doll she expected,"My granddaughter complained about the hair on this doll being stiff and unable to be brushed or 'done up' like her other Barbies. This has to do with the doll itself, not the seller. I have no complaints about the seller or the service. It is the doll that is the problem. I am thinking it is because it is a 'collector's' doll and not a regular Barbie."
3,A good toy,"My daughter had been asking for this barbie for awhile, so when it appeared under her tree for christmas she was happier than ever. Personally this doll is a little creepy looking but my daughter was happy. The only problem was that son, who is 2 years older, likes to pick on my daughter. So when I found the doll on the curve one morning when I walking to work I wasn't suprised. The doll had been hit by many cars and it was wet and was covered by dirty water. So that was the ened of that doll. My daughter still loved it while she had it."
3,Ugly Barbie!,I was so excited about this barbie. I saw her in person at my local TRU the other day. She is not nearly as pretty in person. She has a very un-barbie like face. The white fabric on the dress left something to be desired. The blue fabric was pretty but not perfect. She is one barbie I will not purchase. There are lots of prettier barbies out there.
3,Eyelet tore in Ektelon Court Shoes,"I received the product and tried them on. When lacing up the shoes I found an eyelet on one shoe tore. As it was near the top of the shoe where it receives the most stress, I returned the shoes."
4,don't expect to use for anything else,"Maybe it should be obvious, but don't expect to use them for anything besides playing racquetball (or whatever sport you use them for). I did not last long walking before feeling pains, and definitely not good for running or casual wear. Just thought I would point that out.Otherwise, it's great for the purpose it's intended."
4,Love this shoe!,"I bought this same shoe 3 years ago and when it started to wear down, I saw that same brand for sale again on Amazon. I love this shoe."
2,Not Good for Narrow Feet,I bought these shoes because of the good reviews. The fit was fine lenghtwise but I have narrow size 12 feet and I was getting blisters on my toes because my toes where moving around too much inside. One of the problems is it lacks padding. They seem flimsy. I bought these to replace my Addidas court shoes that wore out. I think I'll stick with Addidas next time since they have much better padding for my feet.
5,"Hope CheckerBee ""does it again"" by putting out a new 2000 ed","I had recently ordered and gotten the 1999 edition of the Puffkins Collector's Guide from CheckerBee Publishing,thought it was a good guide and hoped that they ""did it again"" by putting out a new edition of the Collector's Guide for 2000. I had also thought it was about time they did it since I had noticed that there were SEVERAL new Puffkin releases and retirements since the last guide was published"
5,Escape to Reality,"While much of cineamotography leaves out reality, or even worse highlights the very worse and dispicalble of mankind, this film produced by Billy Graham Ministries is the opposite.It shows a man who is without God, and when his whole world crumbles in a declining profession, the bottom in inevitable. As God so often does, he takes this individual to a place where as Gomer of Hosea fame, the choice becomes obvious: back to the first love, God, or else.I show this to my confirmation kids (age 13-14) and they just love it, and get so much out of it.I believe you will to, and will profit much from this well done and touching story."
4,Good family movie,"We have this on VHS and really loved watching it. It's a really good family movie and several good themes running through it. This was the one movie that my nephew had to watch over and over again - well up into his teens. He seemed to relate to the characters and the themes. We purchased 2 of the movie on DVD: one for a gift and one to keep. After all, as many times as the VHS has been watched, it's bound to need replacing soon. I recommend the movie."
5,The black opera diamond,"Barbara Hendricks is an extraordinary soprano who missed the DVD boom,both because she chose to base her career in Europe and because, forone reason or other, her performances were not filmed. There is an unforgettableprogramme from french TV-3 'Le grand Ã©chiquier' which I would like to see in DVD."
3,Ruby Goes West!,"Look, if you like Rubinstein (and I do), you can't help but enjoy this. The playing is pretty good, when he gets down to it. What's cringingly embarassing are the Hollywood-style setups meant to supply pretext for the music. It's almost surreal in parts (checkout the gardener appaluding in the window; I don't know what it was, but I bet it's illegal to smoke it these days). About the kindest thing you could say about it is that it's a period piece. Still, no serious Rubinstein afficiando should be without it. The uninitiated will hit the stop button mid-way, scratching their heads."
5,Wusthof Steel,"It took 22 years to wear out my original Wusthof Sharpening Steel. Their products are premium, world class and worth every penny. I value my knives highly and wouldn't consider any any knife manufacturer."
1,ZUL Al'QARNIAN AND CONTRADICTION OF SIENCE,"It seems, Mr Bucaille of French Origin had forgotten to explain the verse related with Zul'Al'Qarinan (Alexander the Great), Which suddenly became a Musilm in The Sunni & The Koran, And since he conquered many countries till he reached India, as history tells us:- But The Koran says,""When he reached the setting-place of the sun,he found setting in a muddy spring,(Surat Al-Kahf) (the cave) 18:86, Can you ever imagine that the sun, millions times bigger than the earth ,sets is a muddy spring, unless it is in a size of a Ball. I think Mr Bucaille, you should start reading the Holy Koran one more time, it seems the almighty ""Riyal"" had blocked your eyes completely"
1,a piece of junk,"a desperate attempt by Islam to negate the Bible all to no avail. I remember picking up this book in Qatar in my hotel room where many propaganda material are stored in different languages just to ""confuse"" Christians. Titles like Bucaille's or Ahmad Deedat's apologetics or the famous ""Mohamad in the Bible"" all aim at catching one's eye..Cheap propaganda with one goal : confuse the Christian mind and then ""conquer"" it when it is at its weakest and with no help in sight in the middle of the islamic world (WHERE CHRISTIAN SITES OR BOOKS DEALING WITH SUCH MATTERS ARE STRICTLY FORBIDDEN!!!!). So much for the religion of truth and confusion that cannot even cope with simple sites!!!!!"
4,A must-read for the scientific minded individual,"The Quran, in one of the earliest revelations, says ""READ"".Seeking the truth is part of every intelligent man's responsibility.This book is an intelligent piece of literature and deserves our attention. Whether you are an agnostic or you are an atheist or of course a Christian; take a few quality minutes and give Dr. Maurice a chance to give an unbiased scientific study of Quran and the Bible."
4,Excellent comparative study of science and religion,An excellent guide for those interested in Science and itsrelation to the major religions of Christianity and Islam.A gripping introduction and a must read for all those whoare studying religion.
3,Reviewer of the reviews:,"I haven't read the book yet, but just a comment about a statement made by some reviewers that the guy mentioned in chapter 18 of Quran i.e. Zul'Al'Qarinan is taken to be Alexander the Great.This is an unproved conclusion. Its is not the prevalent view of the Islamic scholars although some ascribe to it."
1,Check the facts before reading this book.,"After reading the book, I interviewed scientists and checkedreference materials. This guy thinks that bones form in a womb beforeorgans flesh and other soft tissues. And he quotes his authoritative evidence as the Quran. That makes Islam look pretty silly to me. Buy this book if you want, but compare it to standard medical and other reference works. It falls apart pretty badly."
2,"The Bible, the Quran and Science is merely propaganda.","Reinterpretation after reinterpretation. If you can't figure out why this is about the only book ever recommended dealing with Science in relation to Islam and Christianity, then you might care to think for a moment whether it's because there is little or no evidence for the assertations that the author makes. It is merely an ad hominem argument which makes use of the Muslim dogma that the Qu'ran is a miracle. If the Qur'an contained such marvelous nuggets of scientific knowledge, then I would expect a lot more nobel prizes coming out of Saudi Arabia. But that's not what you see, because frankly it isn't true, and it is merely a selective reading of the Qur'an, ignoring the more difficult passages that need reconciliation with common sense."
3,A book of it's times maybe?,"So I picked up this book hoping for a good read. Initially I really enjoyed it, until I discovered the book really seems to be about his sexual conquests (they are mentioned repeatedly in each chapter) and also his disdain for archaeologists. He bashes archaeologists and actively subverts the laws of the countries he excavated in. While he makes no claim on being an archaeologist it makes me wish he were. He even admits to lying to a partner who helps him and says he would have to ""educate"" her later after he had gotten what he wanted. Had the sites he plundered been actively researched instead of plundered solely for gold and gems a lot more could have been learned. He wants to prove he found the city of Coaque but he may have destroyed the very evidence that could have proved it. Essentially he's nothing more than a greedy white man come to plunder. No different than the ""explorers"" 400 years ago."
4,food show cheesehead people.,Tastes good. Nice product. Now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their country.
5,Found them!!!,"I never thought I'd be able to find short tension rods -- I needed 11 1/2 inches only -- but I never thought to look in Amazon, either! There they were, and I ordered as fast as I could. In my haste I ordered two packages, so read carefully when you order, since there is a pair in each package.The rods are perfect; and I am learning to go to Amazon to look even when the local stores have an item I need. the reviews can't be beat, and often the prices are lower."
5,nice knife,"A knife every serious cook should have in their kitchen knife selection. Serrated knives, though hard to sharpen are fantastic when sharp. The Wusthof 3"" serrated paring knife is a joy to use."
3,An enjoyable follow up to The Rats,"If you liked The Rats, then you will like this one, as it is more of the same, except this time the rats are on the rampage in a forest just outside London. (This is the second part of a trilogy, although the books can be read separately.) No-one does this quite like Herbert: The action is taut, the description is vivid, and the story is gripping. If the characterisation is a little one dimensional and the story a bit predictable, it doesn't ruin the enjoyment of the book. Come to it with average expectations and enjoy. Not his best but a good one nevertheless."
2,Formulaic,"James Herbert is Englands Dean Koontz. His books are formulaic, samey and predictable. They consist of a main character who is oddly similar to every other main character he has written, a love interest who's general purpose is to provide a lurid, by-numbers sex scene, and vignettes of people getting killed in elaborate ways. Lair is the extremely tedious tale of killer rats, like 'rats' basically but with different killings. Herbert does has talent, he wrote a really good book called 'Shrine' (set near where i live!) which was a generally scary book and another book called 'The Jonah' whose plot i can't remember but it was quite sexy. So check those out and ignore this piece of amateur 'shock' writing."
5,Statistics and Fun,"I liked the book a lot. The cartoons accomplish exactly what they were meant to accomplish--to make the book an entertaining read and thus to facilitate the study of statistics. The characters of de Mere and the guy with a chronic math phobia are so funny that more than once I laughed out loud, looking at them. Difficult statistical concepts are not explained in great detail, so this book should be supplemented by a more conceptually-oriented book to help the beginner. But as a tool for review, this book is perfect for intermediate users."
1,A dry textbook + cartoons,"Whenever I try reading this book my eyes just gloss over. It's extremely dry material with cartoons added to every page to make it seem as if it'll be entertaining and easy to learn from but IMO it's neither. On the contrary, it would probably be best as a reference book. Almost every page has a new equation or symbol on it and I rarely felt that they were adequately discussed. ""What does it do? When is it useful? What does it mean if the value is high/low?"" are questions I constantly asked myself and the book doesn't take the time to answer."
1,Too complicated for the average person to understand!,"After reading the reviews on this book, I purchased it, thinking it would be helpful in clarifying research and basic statistical concepts for me (it's been years since my college statistics courses). Most reviewers seemed to imply that the book presented statistical concepts in ways that would be easy for the average person to understand. However, I found it to be complicated and difficult! I was disappointed in this book, because I struggled to get through it and still don't know any more about general statistical principles than I did before I read it. The book uses numerous mathematical equations without clear enough explanations, which left me totally perplexed. Perhaps the contents and explanations are clear to mathematicians and statisticians, but I think the average person will have a difficult time understanding the content of this book and deriving any benefit from it."
2,Looks Stupid but IS Complicated,"If you're looking for ""Statistics for Dummies"" style simplicity, don't think you'll find it here! Although it looks as though it will be a more accessible introduction to statistics, it's not. The cartoons are OK, and some are informative; but most of the explanations are no simpler than you would find in a good introductory stats text, and are often more complex and less accessible or informative. As someone who regularly teaches statistical concepts to adults (many of whom are certifiably mathophobic), I have to say that I would NOT recommend this to any of my students."
2,Poor Guide,"I purchased this book on the recommendation of my statistics professor. It was intended as a supplementary text to help out with the class. It starts out with some basic concepts and explains them enough to understand. The cartoons are cute, and there is not so much info on each page that it takes intensive reading. However, there is not much explanation or background material either, so I can't imagine a statistics newbie getting much after the first few chapters. I am grasping all the concepts in class very well, but when I read the Cartoon Guide to Statistics I am lost! As someone with a pretty good mind for math and logic, I don't understand how others get much out of this book unless they are already familiar with the concepts.The book itself is nicely done - good illustrations, easy to handle size. But I cannot recommend it. In fact, I would like to sell my half-read version!"
1,"Useless, don't buy this book",I was told this was a simple introduction to statistics. I couldn't even get through half of it before realizing it was a total waste of time.
2,Not a beginners guide to statistics,"Don't be fooled into thinking this book would be a good first step at learning statistics. While the cartoons are good ""refreshers"", they are definately not for beginners. The chapters of the book that deal with probabilities are exceptionally complex and unhelpful. My suggestion, buy SPSS for your computer and use the ""help guide"" included."
4,Excellent Intro to Stats,"Stats isn't an easy thing to learn, but the Cartoon Guide to Stats is the easiest way to learn the basics. In particular it makes hypothesis testing clear. Hypothesis testing is often one of the more difficult areas for new stats students to understand.You can't get rid of your stats textbook (not enough problems to work), but it will help you visualize what is going on. I recommend it on its own or as a supplement to a regular textbook."
4,clear and easy-to-follow guide,this is a book good for beginners to basic statistics. information and concepts were explained through interesting cartoons and daily examples. recommended for beginners to basic statistics!
2,Not quite what I expected,"Even though the cartoons made it a little more interesting than a regular text book, the text itself was about the same. I had hoped for different terms and better visual explanations. It also uses some terms I had not hear before. It also seems to be an old edition, hence the few terms I hadn't heard before. I would not recommend this book for purchase to anyone but if borrowing from a friend or teacher it would be worth the time to look at."
2,Self-study? Try looking elsewhere,"Cartoons definitely make the subject of statistics seem less-intimidating. I bought this book for self-study and found it difficult to follow. Though the cartoons made me smile at times, I was unhappy with the lack of material substance. For instance, equations and topics are thrown out there with little explanation on how they were derived. On multiple occasions, I looked for supporting information that wasn't there. Ultimately, I cannot recommend Cartoon Guide to Statistics. I am, however, finding success with a more expensive book, take a look:Statistics for People Who (Think They) Hate Statistics"
4,Very Helpful!!!!,"I wish I had known about this book, the first time, I took Statistics. This book is helpful because it puts the formulas and problems in a more layman type explanation. My last instructor had a degree in mechanical enigineering & statistics; therefore, she taught the class as if everyone was on her level of knowledge with this crazy math!!! I love this book!! It is worth the money!!"
5,This is the way to learn Statistics,Larry Gonick and the illustrator Woollcott Smith does an excellent job in taking complex topics in Statistics and making it simple for the average person to understand. They do an exceptional job at explaining both Probablity and Statistical Inferences. Great book for a beginning student or a seasoned professional needing a quick review of Statistics.
2,Difficult to follow,Excellent idea but difficult to follow due to the presentation of material. I would not recommend this book for students who are having difficulty understanding basic statistics. Perhaps it would be useful to supplement learning for individuals who possess basic statistical knowledge.
2,Disappointing,"While the pictures are cute, I believe that if you do not already understand the concepts, the book will not help.If you need a review of important statistical concepts, then the book is O.K. If you're looking to learn this for the first time, you will be disappointed."
2,Witty but too brief,"The idea of teaching something like statistics by using cartoons is very attractive, however it falls far short of what the typical reader is expecting. The cartoons in ""The Cartoon Guide to Statistics"" are very well drawn and are humorous and witty. But, since so much page space must be given to the cartoons, there is insufficient text to explain the concepts. Very frequently, you will read ""It's not hard to see that..."" right before a formula with no other help as to how we arrived at this. For those hoping for a good review of statistics and probability to brush up or learn for the first time, ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Statistics"" is far superior. It fully explains all of the concepts and how various formulas are derived with easy to follow examples. The content is almost identical and you will end up with a much better grasp of the subject."
4,jj72 english veiws,"the album was released in the uk a few months ago now and after listening to it for a few months, and would have to say that although mark greaney has quite an efeminate voice you would be forgiven for thinking that hilary was sing but no hes a male post puberty et al. but back to the album for me the stand out track is undercover angel although starting as a slow ode to a love it quickly kicks off royal with a huge riff. if you like the early radiohead albums you will love it"
3,"Once more: ""The New Radiohead""","The young Irish trio JJ72 are already known as Dublin's answer to Radiohead and Jeff Buckley. They will undoubtedly be huge in Britain but do we really need more of that moody ""alternative"" guitar rock? Well, on cool tracks like 'Surrender' they do initially sound like Coldplay but then some real intensity kicks in for the sweeping chorus and they are suddenly not as boring as you might fear. These moments, where the guitar really stings and the singer's otherwise almost annoyingly pretty voice cracks and becomes quite nasty, leave me with some hope that they could evolve into something truly interesting. You should enjoy this debut album if you like the bands I mentioned, just don't expect too much in the way of originality. Yet. By the way, you must check out Muse as well, if you like this."
4,Simplicity concealing profundity,"I'm only familiar with the French original, so I cannot comment on how, or indeed whether, the translation has caught Reza's tone. The original is stunningly spare and simple in its prose, like Beckett or Pinter but without even their levels of affectation. Yet each sentence glistens. Passing moments, events, sounds, emotions are caught with precision and soul. The microtomed slices of life thus presented accumulate somehow into a profound, deeply moving, yet unsentimental esthetic whole. With this work, Reza reveals yet another dimension to her very considerable Art."
5,Incredible Novel,"This is an amazing book with a great heroine that forshadows the conflict in the Middle East. It is also a great insight into Beirut's glory days just before the outbreak of war. Smart, sexy, and suspensful, it is a book that is definitely a must read!"
4,Like it...don't Love it.,"As you probably already know, Wusthof is considered by many a premier knife manufacturer. I quality of the knife is impressive. Clean lines, well constructed...as you would expect from Wusthof.I was disappointed with the weight of the knife. I prefer a heavier knife (as I am not a professional chef...for hours cutting, prepping, producing entrees). This knife is relatively light and has flex. Again, I prefer my knives to possess minimal bend, easier for me to control the cut(s).The knife looks good, performs well, and is delivered sharpened. It is expensive, but like golf clubs, you can buy a knife at a time to complete your ultimate set.Enjoy the knife.""...It's an insult to fast food..."" -Gordon Ramsey"
5,Informative guide to the Southwest,"As a person living on a student budget, I trust Lonely Planet to help me plan exciting and affordable trips -- this book is no different. I highly recommend it!"
4,Great Book Overall,Could have used more content on Chaco Canyon. I just wish LP would start putting in GPS coordinates in for hard to find stuff.
3,depressing,"Randall Robinson has left the building. Okay, he's left the country but not for long. If he needs medical care or decides to promote his book look for him to be right back in the States. This is a pretty sad book. It's well written --the sentences are gramatical and he states his case eloquently---but it's the most depressing thing I've read all year. Mr. Robinson may not hate white people but he sure writes like he does. He's so fed up with America that he has taken himself and his family and ran away to a small formerly English colony island, St. Kitts. Instead of staying and fighting for what he beleives in, he's chosen to cut and run. Sad."
1,pitiful,"this guy is the flip side of the kkk. he's nothing but a racist bigot. my grandfather barely survived the nazi death camps and wears a symbol of that hatred to this day. your hatred is just as sad, but it is masked in the guise of victimhood. you were a slave? how old are you 200? get real randall. america is the best place on earth, and we are better off with you gone.want to read a true story about a real black man who has seen both sides of the coin?check out 'Out of America: A Black Man Confronts Africa' by richburg"
1,Don't let the door hit you where the good lord split you.,Good Riddance you racist pig! Do the rest of us a favor and stay out! We don't need racists like you here anyway. If racism is ever going to be defeated we certainly don't need your kind here.
5,A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE!,"I have followed Mr. Robinson for many years. This is one of his best by far...excluding ""The Debt."" While I have never felt ""comfortable"" living in America...this is all that I know. I applaud Mr. Robinson for moving his family to St. Kitts (his wife's birthplace). It seems that he has found peace in a place that is void of the troubles which plague people of color in United States of America."
5,a must read for every black american,"I love Randall Robinson. I teach World history at an all male school for Emotionally disturbed students. His writing is so clear and understandable . My students listen as I read to them (High-school age) and have another perspective on this country they call home. There is so much the text books don't say . I am recommending this book for their summer reading list, as I prepare to leave America."
5,Amazing restoration,I bought this to use on a wooden bathroom vanity. The wood was dried and the finish was looking pretty bad. I rubbed this on and it looks like new!! Now I am going to use it on my kitchen cabinets! Highly recommend!
5,Formbys Lemon Oil,I have been using Formbys Lemon Oil for over 40 years. I use it in place of furniture polish because it renews the wood by putting moisture in it instead of just setting on the top of the furniture like the polish does.
4,Nice on Bare Wood,"I've used this on bare wood -- a walnut mantle -- for 8 years.Works great, smells great. The tiny squirt hole helps you apply it without wasting.There's something very nice about oiled wood vs varnished wood. Rich glow, but not glossy, not that built-up plastic-coated look.The label is vague about whether you should use it on varnished/polyurethaned wood. It's supposed to ""penetrate and nourish wood."" How would it do that if the wood is sealed with poly?It's probably 60 cents worth of something-oil and 9 cents worth of lemon extract. But the profits go that impossibly nerdy guy on the label who probably lives with his mother, and maybe if he sells enough oil he can update his glasses. Oooops...!! Never mind, Formby's is owned by the $ 7-billion Sherwin-Williams Company.The 16 oz. version:Minwax 30015 Formby's Lemon Oil Treatmentcan be a better deal.""May cause eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation. Avoid contact with eyes and skin."""
1,don't do it,"As a Sam Neill fan I am sorry to say that the film is barely worth the stock it is printed on. The problem seems to be directorial, since actors such as Neill and James Fox, whom we know to be capable of excellent work, seem to be sleepwalking through most of their scenes. Talisa Soto, while nice to look at ""runs the gamut of emotions from A to B"" (thank you Dorothy Parker). There is no discernable spark between her and love interest Neill, even during a ""hot"" tango-driven love scene. This is a suspense/thriller with neither."
1,Worst of the worst,"Guys in Suits is beyond cliche--so poorly narrated and constructed that it doesn't even classify as ""writing."" Revolving around the lives of a few ignorant, beer swilling men who have absolutely no respect for women, Guys in Suits never ceases to disappoint. I cannot believe the reviews posted here, which do their best to sell a truly bad book. Study Van Whitfield to learn how not to write."
1,Recycle Please,"I want to give a brotha props for attempting to write about the black male perspective of relationships. However, he missed the mark. It should have been called ""Boys in Diapers."" Sorry, Mr. Whitfield, but the book bordered on the adventures in adolescent land. I mean men over 30 acting like 12-year-olds. The scene in Dave and Buster's bathroom was disgusting and the part where Stuart pretended to be a producer was so sophomoric.The only purpose this book would serve is how not to write a novel or the recycling bin at work. I know I am harsh, but the book was beyond fictional it was just hideous. Where did the material come from?"
3,not my favorite by him,"Simon and his friend Stuart, are trying to find the right woman to take on vacation with them. I didn't think this one was as good as the author's first two."
4,Entertaining,Guys in Suits is a hilarious story about two best friends Simon and Stuart in the dating game searching for a companion to take along on an annual trip with their two married friends.Van Whitfield is on of the funniest authors around. His vivid picture of these characters in this comedy had me laughing and laughing. I enjoyed Guys in Suits. Best Wishes and Good Luck to Van.
2,Not Whitfield's Best Work,"I wanted to like this book because I loved his last one, but I just couldn't get into it. It was often hard to distinguish which of the two characters were narrarating because their voices at times could be very similar. It also didn't help they had similar names.Whitfield also has a tendency to drag out descriptions leaving me to think, ""Enough already, I get it!"" He tries to be too literal.My advice is to get a copy of 'Something's Wrong With Your Scale'."
2,mediocre,"The book was readable, that's about it. The ending was cute but the point of the story did not seem strong enough to me to base a book around it. The two main characters in the book are extremely immature. Example when Stuart (the suave guy) has to follow a list of things to say to a girl on a date. What type of suave guy can't even hold a conversation without a list to accompany them. They don't know how to act around woman and I hate reading books where the main characters are weak. Most of the stunts pulled in the book are very unbelievable and I didn't find the book very funny. But im guessing if you have read his past books and enjoyed them, you will also like this one."
3,LADIES OF COLOR TURNING PAGES (BOOK CLUB),"This book won an ""Oscar"" for Most Entertaining for 2002 from our book club-LADIES OF COLOR TURNING PAGES. We found the book to be light hearted, humorous and entertaing. We laughed aloud at many of the situations the two main characters-Simon and Stuart encountered. We noted that the author was honest and on target in his observations about men and how they deal with their emotions in relation to women and life."
1,Just Plain Stupid!!!,"This book had an OK storyline, but the two main characters are silly, immature & just plain stupid. The book was poorly written as it was difficult to distinguish which character was talking during certain parts in the chapters. If these are the type of men that are available in the dating scene, then women have a very small selection of eligible bachelors. This book did not entertain or amuse me - I only wanted the book to end as it was a waste of my time."
3,Predictable,"Although not a bad book, it was a little predictable. I got a little bored in the middle, but made it thru."
4,great for fans of foreign cinema,"I initially ordered this film to add to my already 300+ DVD collection.I had the opportunity to introduce this film to an audience at Morehouse College last semester, where it was warmly received.The ending was totally unexpected and viewers will certainly converse as to why it ended the way it did! The age-old question of nature vs. nurture will be asked and debated for hours after the last frame..."
5,GOOD REPLACEMENT FOR FOREVER YOURS!,"GOOD REPLACEMENT FOR FOREVER YOURS! I MISSED THE DARK CHOCOLATE AND THE VANILLA NUGGET. HOWEVER, I REALLY DIDN'T MISS THE EXTRA CALORIES!"
4,BarbAra and John,"I waited a long time for this recording to come out on CD. When I went to order it, the clerk at the store said,""you mean Streisand or Harris"" Since I am also a big John Cullum fan, I found the recording as charming as I had remembered it. Also worthy of note are the performances of William Daniels and Titos Vandas. As much as I admire Barbra Streisand, the recording of the film version doesnt come close! Now if someone would just reissue ""Applause""!"
1,Wrong Title,"The packaging states ""ON A CLEAR DAY"" musical soundtrack. The CD inside was actually MILADIES TOILET MAN and it was disgusting . Amazon would not return my messages...total blooper !"
2,On a Clear Day skip this one.,"This CD just fails for me. The voices are ok; the lyrics are ok; the music is ok; it's all ok. Nothing stands out as stellar on this CD. This show is mainly ballads and dance numbers. I love ballads, I think most shows have too few ballads, but this show makes me wish for more group songs. It's no wonder this show gets so little attention, it just isn't worth it. I think this show might be a good show for community theaters, and high schools, although there are some questionable themes for younger audiences. I don't think this is a CD anyone would listen all the way through. In today's world a listener would only want one or two songs from this CD. I am suggesting that you buy ""Wait Till We're 65"" and ""Come Back to Me"" other than that, not worth it. Of course collectors must have this in their collection and some listeners of older musicals might find bits of this enjoyable, but on the whole. PASS! Favorite song: ""Come Back to Me."""
5,Very sharp,"These knives are very sharp and cut through anything ""like butter"". I've had a chef, bread and paring knife by Wusthof for 13 years now and they are still used on a regular basis. This costs, but the quality will last."
5,wusthof Classic Steak knives,"Fantastic knives. Cut thru meat like butter. No sawing thru, just smooth as silk. Would be nice to have a box to put them in though. Remember not to put them in the dishwasher. Hand wash only. The harsh chemicals will eat away at the perfect edge and the handles too. If you want only the best, then these are the ones to buy. You won't be disapointed."
5,"Sharp and oh, so easy to slice steak!","A set of these steak knives came with the block set that I purchased. I am so glad that I purchased that block set because I may not have purchased Wusthof steak knives othterwise. But these knives are well worth their price. They slice the meat, they don't rip through it as other knives do. Did I mention they were sharp? Do not do what you may do with your regular knives as I did one - placing them so the blade is leaning up on the plate. I did this and the knife slid off and brushed against the side of my hand, I did say they were sharp, right? Yes, they acutally cut my hand with the very little pressure of sliding off of my plate. So, put them flat on the table, blade side away from you and there is no problem."
5,you will laugh at other knives,all i can say is wusthof knives are amazing. i received them as a wedding gift even though they weren't on my registry and i'm so glad i did. i had chicago cutlerly on my registry and i don't use them at all now. the wusthof knives are so safe because you're never struggling to cut something. i put them through the dishwasher and they never come out tarnished and rusty like the chicago cutlerly does. i love them and want to give them as gifts now.
2,misleading,"This book is unfortunately very misleading in its content - Aimed as a multi format guide, the book rarely strays away from comic book technique.For filmmakers/animators, this book offers little beyond rudimentary film theory and skills. Plus the majority of the example material is very sub-standard. Avoid this one."
2,Uh.. ya,"This is freakin RED. Orange-ish red, but red none the less. Doesn't look like photo either. There is a website that has photos of people who used this color and their hair looks orange. I hope to dear god this fades!!!!! Totally ruined what I was trying to do with my hair. Next time I will use Manic Panic's other orange."
3,Runs a bit,"Loved the color but it was a bit more red than orange (which I was going for). BUT, the color ran for me. Even after 5-7 shampooings, if I perspired (and it is summer folks) the collars of my shirts turned red and there were drips of stain on my shirts. May be fine in winter though."
1,NOT temporary,Do not use unless you want orange hair indefinitely.I had to see a professional and it is STILL orange.Will not use again.
1,Not as pictured but made it right in the end.,This did not come as pictured and I explained. They refunded me but I dont suggest anyone buy this color of manic panic ever online as you can not garuntee it will arrive as you think.
3,Pleasant entertainment,"Here's a new Slocum adventure in which he meets a British aristocrat who owns a ranch, drinks constantly, and appears bumbling but turns out to have some special skills. Slocum also meets the sensual proprieter of a saloon in the midst of Mormon country. He also meets a herd of nasty gunmen and a crooked sheriff. What more needs to be said?This is enough content to make a decent entry in the long-running series, and to provide diverting entertainment for readers. 5.2 hrs."
4,Cold Clean Fun,"Paul Haig, Josef K's lead singer and guitarist, wrote quick, metallic, jangly guitar songs about the frustration and hunger of youth. The melodic yet disaffected music on this double-length CD burns with integrity. Integrity is what drove Josef K to recall their debut album on the eve of its release due to slick production. It made them wary of self-promotion, even to the point of refusing to speak to their audience when playing live. And it kept their post-punk music minimalistic and severe.Idealism like that can only last a few years, and so did the band. But looking back more than two decades later, this faithfully remastered CD is easy to like and impossible not to respect."
3,Be careful before buying,"This was hugely influential and got critical acclaim like you would never believe the first time it came out. Based on the reviews it received back then I bought the original LP...and never listened to it again. I do not know. It is the kind of music where I am not sure why critics really love it so much. At the same time too poppy and too alternative, in some ways it does not know where it belongs. Paul Hiag went on to produce some fantastic techno stuff later on so there must have been something in here. He had an uncanny ear for melody in his later word."
4,Combat meets Star Trek,"A very fine series from a few years ago that never quite found its audience. It is the story of how a group of Marines face and fight an alien invasion force. It has some really good special effects and story lines. This is not another ""monster of the week show"". The continuing story arcs allow for a fuller character development over time than some other series have done. If you liked Babylon 5, this is right up your alley. I give it a hearty recommendation."
4,Nostalgia,I had fond memories of the quality of this short lived series. It had been very difficult to locate it on my limited television channels back when it was originally broadcast and so I missed many episodes. I was pleased to find this available and quickly purchased it once I saw it was available. It is very worthwhile. One note: when I originally received my boxed set of DVDs I found that one of the discs was duplicated and one missing. I contacted Amazon.com and they resolved the matter very quickly by sending out a replacement set along with a pre-paid postage label to return the defective set. They fixed the problem quickly and made it easy to cope with on my end!
3,S:AAB,Epsoide 2 seems to have 14 minutes of broken footage.Seems to be on every Box Set. Must have been a production error.
4,Show with an identity crisis,"I like sci-fi, but everything is supposed to be taking place in the 2060s. Why are the Marines still flying F-18s? This would be like flying Sopwith Camels or SPADS in the year 1990. Why are the Marines still wearing khaki? With Vietnam-era ribbons? And how many people are in this squadron? And what is their job... are they fighter pilots, special ops or grunts? Shouldn't they be doing more training if they do this many jobs?Maybe it's just that this show was a product of its time. Clinton had just been elected and it was indeed conceivable that we wouldn't get funding for any new military hardware for 70 years if he had anything to say about it.Oh well. The story lines are pretty good and they do help to carry the show."
4,Great to this out on DVD,"5 stars for content, -1 for packaging.This is a wonderful series that like most SciFi I enjoy was cancelled early. Fairly typeset characters at the beginning grow and become engaging. The plots are goods. The effects well done, and the physics far more reasonable than most except for the wormholes. When this show and the X-Files premiered together it was one of the few times I would go out of my way to spend an evening in front of the TV. I really would have liked a couple of more seasons of this one.The quality of the DVDs is excellent with the exception of the use of two sided DVDs. I fail to understand the motivation of the studios to still use this. Nothing but complaints from consumers as far as I have seen with most DVDs that require 'flipping', and not that large a cost savings I wouldn't think.All in all tis is still a nice set, and certainly not before time."
4,Space Above and Beyond - The Complete Series,"What a great series this one was. Space battles and Green goo, the survival of man against the beast seems where ever man goes he will always have to fine an enemey to kill keep the primal instinct happening. KILL or be KILLED... Still the visuals were good to see the drop ships to the cruisers.."
2,Tentacle Difficulty,"I loved this series when it first appeared on TV. So when it was finally made available on DVD I bought it from ""Worst Buy"" online. The disks were complete garbage and were freezing up from the beginning. Then trying to get them returned to ""Worst Buy"" was a joke. They couldn't just exchange them at the store, nooooooooooooooo I had to get my money back from the online store. I quit buying from ""Worst Buy"" right there and then. For making ""Worst Buy"" the exclusive outlet for this series release, I will never buy the series. I've been spooged on for the last time."
1,Disappointed,"I watched this thinking it was comparable to the quality of the series Firefly, but the characters here are much too one dimensional. The plots are not very original or creative. Also one thing that bothered me personally the politics is distinctly right wing and makes a poor case for it's side. For example in one episode they have a progressive politician advocating civil rights for all vs. a right wing strong man. In the end the progressive is found to be leading a conspiracy to commit murder. This didn't fit the character's values except, perhaps, in some right wing fantasies."
2,Less than half worth your time,"The good episodes were a 4 star; however, the rest were a 1 star. In contrast, FireFly is a 4+ star."
1,Don't waste your money,"Disappointing. This is just another formula bad alien war series. Got the IAs killing humans, the In Vitros shunned by the humans that created them, and the rest just shooting up the place. Tacky catch phrases like ""If a friendly finds me I want my ashes scattered over Rigley Field."" This is just adolescent drivel. Even has the overblown lip Angelina Jolie look alike. It seems to try to take after ""Starship Troopers,"" but lacks the humor of the movie. Contrary to a couple of the other reviews, there is nothing original. You want a good series set in space, get Firefly. Now there is some imagination and a story line."
4,Great DVD!,"I gave this to my partner as a birthday gift and he loved it! Unfortunately due to the production quality, the picture is not as good as we had hoped, but this is to be expected with anything pre 1998. As for the series itself.....brilliant! If you are a fan of Firefly you will love this."
5,A beautiful show,"For a sci-fi story based on war in space, the series was remarkably intelligent and sensitive, the characters were interesting and well-played. Though I'm always a fan of guns and explosions, the ""slow"" moments in each episode were absolutely beautiful and just as engaging, if not more so, than the action scenes.This was a rare gem of a show that should have lived much longer. In this sense, the comparison to Joss Whedon's Firefly is easy to make."
4,Some of the best eps of any show on TV,"In general, I didn't like the show too much but caught most of the eps on release just because they were sci fi. Decent sci fi deserved nurturing in those days.Most did not hook me in, but the relatively few episodes that rose above the average blew me away. I still hold ""Never No More/Angriest Angel"" and ""Ray Butts"" as 3 of my favorite hours watching the tube and would easily pay the price of the boxed set just for them.The new ""Battlestar Galactica"" has slipped alot of ""similar"" material from this series into their show. And BG feels alot more like SAB than it does the original BG. If you like that, you will like this show.As has been said, there was alot of heart here and at least another couple seasons were deserved. Oh well..."
2,space above and beyond,space above and beyond is a great series. but the dvds are poorly made and will not play in some dvd players my computer tells me bad sectors on 2 of the 5 disk
4,Wish there was more!,"What can I say, I was a HUGE fan of the series when it was running on Fox.. Soon and I received the complete series I could hardly wait to see it. I was not disappointed.Its truly sad to see Fox kill a great Sci-Fi Action/Drama after only one season. At least I have it now so I can watch it again and again."
4,Space: Above and Beyond,"I loved this show when it was on Fox 10 years ago. They always seem to pull the shows I like. I liked the DVD's, I do wish they would have spaced them out for better quality, but at least they released them. I did notice the huge graphic error on the DVD Menus. In case you're not a Babylon 5 fan, thpicture of the B5 station ere is a slightly altered on the SAAB Main Menu. Not only is it not the same universe, but it's a Warner Brothers copyrighted material on a Fox DVD. So check it out and laugh along with me."
2,The DVD's are OK but,The show is pathetic. It is a pathetic war series with an even more pathetic disguise of SF. The screenplay is like for 10 years old children. The packaging and the DVD's are OK. That's why it got the second star.
4,"Space Above and Beyond, Cowboy Allegory in Space","This was one of the better series of its time and was vastly under-appreciated. The acting, while often a bit over the top, was not so out of line for the genre.It was about overcoming the fear of the unknown as well as the fear of the perceived, racism, Political Correctness, and the need to always be RIGHT!The characters were well drawn, human, with flaws which not only endeared them but made them fallible and believable. As with all allegories, much is simplified and repeated. Themes are played out again and again. Those who do not trust tend to not trust, etc. The ""tank"" goes from asserting aggressively that he has no human emotions to knowing what it means to be and have a friend.While it ain't perfect, it is certainly worth seeing and deserved a better fate (and a longer run) than it got. Another two or three years and it could have been one of the best Sci-fi series of all time. But such was not to be. Tucker Smallwood is a jewel!"
3,WEAK WRITING.,"The pilot episode featured veteran actor Lee Ermey, who played the drill instructor in ""Full Metal Jacket."" I might have his name wrong. He plays a drill instructor in the pilot. First mistake: they should have used him as a permamnent cast member with a bigger role. I had high hopes for the series. I find myself falling into the cliche of wanting to see a celebrity actor in this series. Its a bunch of no-name actors, and this show did not last long enough to make any of these guys famous. James Morrison, the colonel on the battleship, looks familiar, but just familiar. a lot of scenes are stuff reworked from battlestar galatica, and terminator. the show struggles to find its own unique flavor. the episodes are cliche story lines of soldiers with attitudes going into battle-hardened frontlines. its a war that never ends. and we dont really get to understand what the enemy is all about."
3,"Good story, poor disks","Another series cancelled sadly before its time, Space A&B; tells the tory of a group of marine pilots in a war with an apparently unknown alien race. Rogue Androids also serve to annoy our heroes. The premise is good, though there are a few flaws - the very ecpensive marine pilots get assigned to grunt duty when the plot requires. The graphics are superb.The only flaw is that my cheap multi region DVD player doesn't like the first side of the first disk. The lip sync is choppy and the picture quality poor in places. The rest of the disks appear OK though."
4,"Great Show, Some quality issues.","I Loved this show, and glad to have it on DVD (other scifi favorites I liked were Firefly, and Star Trek; to be honest, there are very few scifi show I really like, I think most are pretty bad). Anyway, moving on. I will admit, the quality is not very good - at least in the first couple episodes; it looks like it went straight from VHS to DVD. Very grainy in most scenes, even film lines in some areas. But as the series continues, it seems like the quality improves, which means I'm either getting used to it, or the show got a higher budget and was able to improve on things; and yes, I know this show, and therefore the technology, is 10 years old. A great show to watch though. Really a lot of fun."
4,awsome awsome,"great great series except for the abrupt ending, good acting for the most part, great story, but as any with these types of series the pilots are more then pilots they are special forces lol...still good though. just sad it ended the way it did and left to much open without a continiation."
5,Space Above and Beyond,"Great series that never quite had a chance for an audience share. If you take the old series Combat and Star Trek, you would end up with something similar. A good cast brings the characters to life. References to current social problems and historical events makes it all a little more real."
4,A great series,Space A&B; was originally aired inthe mid-90s. I caught two episodes (just getting into it) before it was taken off the air. Buying the series let me see wht i was missing - which was a lot.Space A&B; is another victim of poor scheduling on a poor network. Execs just have no idea of how good a show is when only 20% of all people can get the show.
1,Above and Beyond,Unable to view this as can not be read in the UK. Is there not another version which can be read here and if so why was it not sent to me?
4,Great show kill before its time,This is and was a great show. Fox killed it before its time. The story is great and the plot interesting. I would recommend it for anyone inerested in the space sci-fi stories.
5,My Dad can't believe they cancelled this show ...,This was one of my Dad's favorite gifts this Christmas. He'd been looking for it forever. He has been watching it non stop and is so disappointed that it didn't run longer. He says it's very realistic and he's a former marine so that says something.
4,Space Above & Beyond.,"I finally got the series on DVD. Everything was great, but I have only a few minor complaints. Some of the stories were incomplete. as an example, the episode where Hawkes lands on a hotspot to assassinate an enemy Commander, he emerges from the bottom of a pond, kills his target, I think, and then goes back to his pod. He was told that if he successfully completed his mission, the rest of his sentence would be wiped and he could then leave the unit. And yet in the next episode he continues as if that mission never happened.The other complaint is the fact that there was only one series made. It left the storyline unfinished.But apart from that, it was a good series. I enjoyed it."
5,FOX WTF over!,"This was one of the best SCI/FI ever conceived, the kind that would even send Gene Rodenberry back to the drawing board. But, FOX time slotted it wrong and like all networks that screw that up point at interest in the show. If you don't like SCI/FI this will probably change that. If you like SCI/FI this will probably make you love it and run down to join the USMC. Okay, I'm exaggerating a little...It truly was a work of SCI/FI art. And please don't compare it to those horrible Starship Trooper movies. I would love to bitch slap the people who made those. Buy this you won't regret it! I honestly think, put in the right time slot and the severe beating of the Starship Troopers movie makers, this show could have seriously hurt the Star Trek series of the time."
4,"Great Show, not so great transfer","Everyone has already talked about the show, it had such great potential. Stupid FOX executives. Between this and Firefly they all should ... well... anyway....The DVD package is simple, the discs are double sided, no extras and the film transfers are awful. But you can't get the show any other better format.If you liked the show, the set is worth it."
5,YAY,"Indeed, this was a stellar show. It even had R. Lee Ermey as the drill instructor. However, this show came out 2 years before Starship Troopers, not after. I actually thought ""Troopers"" was a S:AAB movie from the first trailer."
4,Not Complete,This is misleading..and how do I know?..because my fave episode is missing..I don't mind not having the extras...though it would be nice...but don't say complete when is not....:(
3,GOOD,"This is a pretty good male female folk dou who do some cover songs. The album maintains a soft and subtle tone--not bad soft music. But at times, such as when they cover ""Wind"" byCircus Maximus, they are a little too laid back. You lose some of the impact.Worth getting but not streching your neck for."
5,Wusthof never disappoints!,"One that I added to my set this year. Haven't had a chance to use it yet, but I know I will be happy. You gotta love Wusthof!"
2,it broke after one year,"I really enjoyed using this knife. Until the blade broke in half while I was slicing some (boneless) roasted meat. I did not use any excessive pressure. All in all, the knife lasted a bit longer than a year. I think a knife at this price range should be more durable than that."
2,Cuts well but rusted,"After entirely TOO much time spent researching which knives to go with (Wustof or Henckels), I went with Wustof on recommendation from a Williams-Sonoma staff person. While the blade cuts nicely and does its job, the construction left a lot to be desired. I had the knife thru two washings and saw rust building up between the handle and full tang of the blade. Now, it's possible I have a lemon, but when I'm spending $50 per knife, I don't want to see anything really wrong with it. I don't want to be responsible for poisoning any dinner guests with rust! I bought the single knife to test whether I'd want the whole set, and well, it doesn't look like I'll be splurging."
5,"wonderfully versatile, very useful","I'd like to disagree with the ""may be overkill"" review. I think this knife is a fantastic addition to any kitchen, especially for a college student who can't afford a wide range of equipment. The great thing about this knife is its versatility: it's perfectly sized and can take on any number of jobs, from tomatoes to meats to bread. I only have three knives (this one, the 5"" non-serrated utility, and the 8"" chef's knife), and even with all the cooking I do (e.g. thanksgiving for 10), I've never needed anything more than those three essentials. Sure, you may not use the serrated utility knife as often as a chef's knife or paring knife, but you will get a great deal of use out of it. A serrated knife is indespensable, and this one is certainly well worth the investment."
5,Posture Perfect,"This product was everything I wanted. Excellent quality and a great price. To improve posture and overall health, I would highly recommend this product."
4,Great Reminder,"This works really great to remind you to keep your shoulders back because if you start to slouch you will feel it tighten under your armpits. I wear it over my ""cami"" undershirt and yes, it's uncomfortable up against bare skin at first but I got used to it very fast and already feel my back reshaping in a positive manner. I definitely would suggest buying this if you're looking for a posture-correcting device."
2,not as pictured,"The product I received was not as well made as the picture. It was simply only one piece elastic with a closure sewed into two loops. This new change to the product causes it to ride up the back all the way to the neck and since there isn't the diagonal give as in the photo, the hook and eye also wants to undo itself. It does keep the shoulders back for a while, but needs to be repositioned after about an hour, it is not something that is easily worn all day."
2,Not worth the money,"This product is more of a ""reminder"" than a posture corrector. First, you need to wear a shirt of some kind WITH SLEEVES under it or it will chafe. If it isn't tight enough, it's worthless. If it is tight enough, sometimes it rides up in the back, and it's visible from behind. I also had to crimp the fasteners as they came undone."
2,not a big help,this helps a little bit to correct my posture. but it's not very comfortable so I don't usually wear it.
2,not that great,"I'm a sloucher, and this product sounded promising. It has give, which is fine, and it did remind me to push my shoulders back. It was uncomfortable, so I wore it over my shirt around the house, or in between shirts if I was going out. I expected a brace of this nature to be somewhat uncomfortable. The reason I don't like it is because if I forgot and slouched again, the brace rode up to my neck, and I'd have to reach up and pull it back down. I was always adjusting it. I experimented with wearing it upside down also, thinking I wasn't wearing it right. It's a great idea, and I'll keep looking for a brace, but this one is not great."
2,posture support,"I ordered this item because I wanted something to remind me to stand up straighter. It does that. However it is one size fits all, which isn't really true. It does have adjustable closures, but I have a very broad back. My complaint is that if not placed exactly right your hands get all tingly because it cuts off the circulation."
3,a disappointment...=/,"very uncomfortable to wear because it digs into your skin. as other people have mentioned, i recommend you wear it over your clothing which means you should only wear it at home. doesn't work as well as i hoped. =/"
1,poor purchase,This was very uncomfortable and did not helpwill not recommend any one buy this.Doctor said it was a wasteof money and very bad product
1,Not too helpful.,"These are not too helpful and kind of painful. They come in one size fits all, so you many have to cut part of it or else you have 6 loops hanging from the back. They do keep your posture in mind, but do not really stay in the correct location for upper t-spine, more like c-spine. Hurts under arms after an hour of wear."
4,Everyone knows you are a liar...,"This album couldn't have come out at a better time. This album reflects the mounting frustration many of us feel with the current administration and it's policies. The evens put together an album with fantastic lyrics, with the perfect background of speedy acoustic guitar and perfectly timed percussion. This is a slight upgrade over the first evens album, which while also very good, is not as cohesive as Get Evens. Very catchy. Not for the closed minded or probably those that lean to the far right."
2,Low quality timer,I bought two of these stopwatches for Physical training Tests. The displays are hard to see in sunlight and the buttons can be accidently pressed too easily. I used the two about a dozen times in the past year and they are both dead now. Cheap is cheap and you get what you pay for. I will purchase two new watches of better quality next time. For now I use a $30 Casio wrist watch and an I pod. Not very professional looking but they get the job done for now.I would not recommend this item.
5,Great supplement for Biology students,I use this book to introduce topics to my students or to expand on different topics. It's very user friendly and great for high school biology concepts. I also have the biology coloring book by Robert Griffin and this one is a million times better!
1,This Game Is Absolutely Lousy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is a rip off. It is so bad it is unplayable. One star was too high a rating for it. I unfortunately bought it before there was a review on it anywhere, so there was no warning. If you don't believe me take a look at Gamespots review. I can't even believe Amazon would sell such a piece of trash."
1,Whirlwind Over Vietnam,"I can not comment on the game, as I have not had a chance to play it. There was not enough information provided as to what equipment you need to upload this game on the computer. The system that this game is for is XP, but it does not tell you that you can not run it on an integrated video card system, so the only thing that you can view is the menu and when you click the fly mode button the game shuts off. I think that all available information on these games should be posted for the viewer to be able to check there system before purchase."
1,What were they thinking,Let me start by saying I really enjoyed IL-2 and thought what better people to make a Vietnam Helo game! I was stoked at the thought of flying hueys! I bought a Trackir in hopes that this game would support it like thier other titles but NOOOO!! I played Veitnam Med-Evac Search and Rescue and thought its flight model was good and it was very challenging but out dated. I played WoV about 1 hour and never played again! I can only hope that they come out with a patch to fix this lame game. You might as well watch a movie about flying a helicopter cause this is NOT GOOD! I ended up buying microsoft FSX and got my helo fix that way but it lacks the missions of Veitnam Med-Evac. Why couldn't they make a Veitnam helo game based on dustoff pilots? Having to land in on going battles and grab your wounded at get out would be much better than fly with 9 more choppers and be told exactly what to do! I thought gaming was moving away from the scripted game play but I guess I was wrong.
5,Inspirational,There is a purity in her voice that makes you feel her devotion. Very inspirational and peaceful. Love Loretta! Great dvd.
5,The High Kings,Awesome show. Our local PBS station played the DVD as a fundraiser and charged over $125 for the DVD. A must have for a lover of Irish music.
5,The High Kings,"The merchandise came in the time promised, the merchandise was what I ordered and was a great CD and DVD."
3,The High Kings,This DVD is okay. It doesn't have the flash that Celtic Thunder 2 has but has more actual Celtic music. The men of the group play as well as sing.
3,a mediocre show,"the video came in excellent shape, well wrapped, clear and clear picture.the contents were disappointing; the high kings held no candle to thewonderful and joyful 'celtic thunder'.since i enjoy 'celtic thunder' so much, i would be lax to buy another 'celtic' dvd."
2,Another mistake!!!,"Same problem ,I again mistakenly thought I was buying something related to my newest passion ""CelticThunder "" seems to me I saw Paul being interviewed talking about it so I could'nt send for it fast enough,and was again so upset when I played it.I really have no review pro or con for the cd,it's just not my guys.I guess I'm stuck on the one group,so nothing else will do for me."
1,wrong region,"Hi there,I would like to purchase this DVD but it is NTSC not PAL, or it'sRegion 1 not Region 4. Any ideas? Was a CD produced?RegardsMegan TudorDown-under"
5,AMAZING,"I love this so much. Now here's my review:The songs here are gorgeous and very well sung. The beginning, The Rocky Road To Dublin is great, and starts you off feeling giddy and it draws you in completely. The Little Beggarman, which is the seventh song, I think, is a great arrangement. It's so fun to watch. Later on, a dancer comes out and performs wonderfully with the bodhran player. The song at the end of the DVD, The Parting Glass, is FANTASTIC. Very moving. Throughout the entire DVD, the boys are fun to watch. Martin is fun and multi-talented, Finbarr is calming in a way, Darren is fresh and interesting and Brian is hilariously dramatic. (Don't tell him I said that.)Anyway, this is wonderful. I bought this with my own money and DO NOT REGRET IT AT ALL!!!-from a 17 year old black girl from Tennessee."
5,From New Zealand,We received the High Kings DVD here New Zealand in quite a short time from Amazon.We are more than pleased with our purchase. We know most of the songs performed and found the show very entertaining . Well worth the purchase. Highly reccommend Cheers
3,"Not a lot of ""meat""","While I found some of the information useful, I won't go back to view it a second time. There are much more useful reference materials out there."
1,Save your money...,"I am not a negative person who likes to crticise or say negative things, but this is a field I take seriously. DO NOT waste your money on this video. Sound, picture, and commentary are elementary. It was actually taxing to watch the first ten minutes, and I couldn't watch anymore. I'm not even going to try to finsih it, it was that terrible."
5,I love the peanuts.,I have every episode and movie of Charlie brown. The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show was a great show. I wish they had made more episodes thou.
5,Justice series 1 Cheetah,This is one of the first in the Justice series of Alex Ross inspired Super Friends action figures. Cheetah is from the Legion of Doom line used to attack the Justice League of America. This figure is awesome and the detail is amazing. The face is really great showing the expression of anger she always has towards Wonder Woman. Worth every investmetn to true collectors.
5,Nice product,Liked the product. Played Badminton with this shoes and its perfect for me. I would recommend this product to my friends.
1,Worst text book ever.,I ordered this word salad for research methods. I also checked one out of my school's library to skim through it. I found the chapters to be so wordy that any real information was lost in the haze. Why my department selected Heppner over Creswell is beyond me. I just wish I could give this book a ZERO because even one star is too many.
5,Oops....She did it again....one more time!,"Hey, if you are a britney fan, and obviously you are sicne you are looking into this cd, then you will love the stronger import single! I bought a little while back, and since then it has not come out of my cd player! This is an incredible song with incredible vocals! This is definately Britney's strongest song to date and it is a must have for any Brit fan! I love Stronger, and usually when you hear a remix of a song, it is not very good, but the remix on this cd is different, it is actually pretty good! Not to mention the song Walk On By! walk on By is a mid-tempo song, with very infectious Vocals and an amazing beat! So do yourself a favor and pick this one up! You will deffinately by glad that you did!"
3,Claustraphobia,"Besides feeling trapped underground with Jill Pole, Eustace and that other guy for half the book...I did fine.This story seemed to have stronger language then the others...I think I'll give the author credit...by saying it was because Jill Pole and Eustace came from a troublesome school enviroment...and their language fits their characters.Well, this was a nice adventure...a bit more serious. I miss Lucy and Edmund especially, but at least you have their cousin.I like the theme about the signs...remember those signs. That was the best thing about this book to me. Oh ya...and how scary it was to trust Prince Rillian(read and find out...or watch the movie). The funny thing is I saw the film and still was in dreadful suspense reading the book."
4,"A Very Good Investment for the ""Mythos Maniac""","If you're REALLY into H.P. Lovecraft's horror writings, then this is a ""must-have"" book! It contains a bibliography listing just about every piece of fiction written that is connected to the ""Cthulu Mythos"" of H.P. Lovecraft, a concordance of important ""mythos terms"" detailing the stories where they appeared, an index of works by title, a guide to the writers' names and pseudonyms, and a selected list of story collections. The book doesn't have anything near to a complete list of ALL published collections, however, and appears to favor hardbound over softbound books. The bibliography is also focused on the original publication location of each work, rather than subsequent or current publications that may contain it (this last is somewhat compensated by the selected collections listing, many of which are currently available). All in all, an excellent work for any Mythos fanatic to add to their collection."
5,Essential Knife for Home Chefs,"While hefting a cook's knife with a 10-inch blade can take a bit of practice, I recommend this size for everyone except those who have small hands. I started collecting WÃ¼sthof-Trident Classic knives for home use twenty years ago, and this 10-inch Cook's Knife was my first purchase from this excellent line. I like the look and feel of traditional, triple-riveted, full tang high-carbon steel cutlery, which is why I have chosen the Classic line. (A comparable line would be J.A. Henckels Pro-S.) I use a honing steel on it often, and sharpen it myself with a Chef's Choice 3-Stage Diamond Hone Professional Sharpener. Also, I have always hand-washed and dried it. After lots of use, it still holds a keen edge."
5,Great knife,"This is a serious knife and not for the faint hearted. It is maybe a bit bigger than I expected but my husband loves it and uses it more than me (I use smaller ones from the same range).Very sharp, comfortable to use and well worth the money"
3,look again...,"I've used this knife for 10 years, but even though I steel every use and stone sharpen, I've never been happy with the way it held an edge.This past year, I've switched from Wusthof/henkel to Globe and Kasumi both of which hold an edge much better and are actually more ergonomically designed.Kasumi is hand forged in the Damascus tradition and is a wonderful experience to work with.... Really, you can do much better than Wusthof for the price..."
1,Hideous Edition,"One star reflects not the content of Religious Affections, but the deplorable quality of the Sovereign Grace Publishers edition. For starters, the author's name is mis-spelled on the cover and spine (""jonathOn""). Once you overlook the cover, the font and type size make reading this edition a truly painful experience. I recommend Edwards... but save yourself the embarrassment and headaches (literally!) of this edition."
5,Probably the best formatted Kindle edition out there,"Of the 4 different samples of Religious Affections for the Kindle, and I found this to be the most readable. There are italics and underlining in the text, which makes it easier to read. It's not perfect (5-way controller can't skip ahead to a different section) but the Scriptural references are underlined (linked to CCEL site, but it's a barely functional site on the Kindle), and the footnotes work."
5,"A godsend, but only if you're dedicated to seeing it through","As another reviewer noted, you've got to be disciplined to go through this book. Heisig states that with full-time study, you could cover this book in something less than 2 months. Studying part-time (job, kids, and a life), I'm through 1600 kanji at the 3 month mark, and can see the finish line.I've been studying Japanese for 7 years, and can speak fluently. I have tried manifold methods for learning the kanji piecemeal, but have never advanced beyond what a Japanese twelve-year old might know. Upon completion of this book, I'm very confident that I can take this acquired visual memory and run with it to become literate. (Can you hear the chorus of angels in the background?)If you are just getting started in Japanese but want to get beyond the spoken, take a season to go through this book. You won't regret it."
2,Bad Approach,"The only thing this book is good for is identifying the roots of little kanji that fit into big kanji. btw, this is not educational, it's just interesting. There are WAY too many kanji of esoteric words. this would move the 2000 kanji down to about 500 or so.Also, the definitions are in english. This is completely the wrong way to learn, you should learn the japanese word for it and then learn what that japanese word means, it's much more useful to relate it to japanese, then you would think in japanese, and not in english. the whole point of learning a new language is to think in a new way, not to fall back on english every step of the way.Finally, most of the stories are ridiculously stupid. and I find it offensive how a good number of them refer to the bible."
1,Only for the curious learners of Japanese Kanji,If you are interested in learning how to read Kanji through Japanese and not through English this is not the book for you. I remember buying this book when I first arrived in Japan on a friend's recommendation and using it for about one month. No pronuciation or readings of the Kanji are given. I remember some of the first kanji introduced were conclave and convex. Why? A total waste of time. Get Henshall's book Remembering the Kanji - it is far superior!
1,You learn to read Kanji but not Japanese,Compounds! That's Japanese. Learning individual Kanji is effectively a waste of time because the most important stuff is the compounds of two Kanji. Think if you know 2000 words then you have the vocab of your average 2 year old. It's through combining Kanji that you become proficient and for that you need about 1000-1200 to cover 80-90% of Japanese.My recommendation is to get very good at the first 600 and their compounds. You'll either have given up by this point or you'll have found many other superior books :)
3,"Helpful book, but...","I'm currently learning Japanese, taking the introduction class. I find this book quite helpful for remembering the meaning and shape of kanji; however, it doesn't teach you the sound of the characters, which I find quite dissapointing.So far I've gone through around the first 400 words and it was tiring to write down every single furigana for those characters to help me remember the sounds. The book would be perfect with furigana added above all the characters, or roomaji if necessary."
1,Terrible Book,"The book doesn't tell you HOW TO PRONOUNCE the kanji. So if you see a new kanji, you know that it (might) mean exit....but there are multiple readings for each Kanji.If I weren't living in Japan, I'd return this book immediately. Unfortunately, I already paid for shipping out to Japan and I'd have to pay for shipping back to the States, so it's easier for me to just keep this book and use it as a paperweight or something."
3,Requires more discipline than most have.,"* The mnemonic method Heisig uses is the best way to learn the characters and strokes.* His goal of getting a western adult to equal someone raised within a Chinese/Japanese language setting is both desirable and good.* The book is very hard to use in a classroom setting, particularly considering only the first three hundred radicals are developed enough for consistent testing of anything other than complete understanding.* The amount of self discipline required to succeed with this book is extremely high, and so may not be for you. If you are a personality type that can sit down, read a text book, and do all of the problems at the end of a chapter, then perhaps this is for you. If you are better suited to working through problems in class, then I would recommend a different method."
2,Not the way to learn,"""Remebering Kanji: A Complete Course on How Not to Forget the Meaning and Writing of Japanese Characters""is about just that, this book is just to look at the Kanji characters and read some weird ideas the author came up with. It doesn't give the word in Japanese, is just a nice list. Kanji is learned in sentences because different Kanji character meand different things when attached to one another. But I give them two stars for the print they wasted."
4,Scent takes you on a tropical vacation,"I was concerned when I received this lotion. My small bottle purchased elsewhere had WHITE lotion, this lotion was TAN colored. But, to my amazement, it smells the same and the quality appears to be the same. The scent is wonderful and will remind you of a wonderful vacation. I cannot use it in public without someone asking, ""What is that wonderful smell."" The lotion absorbs quickly and will leave your hands smooth and soft."
5,The Real Reality (without hugging trees),"This book is a ""must read"" for anyone interested in the Truth. Recently, I spent 9 days in a higher state of consciousness during which time I had full awareness of my chakras. Afterwards, I read Chakra Therapy. The model presented in the book is exactly what I experienced. The author obviously speaks from a position of experience.The book explains the ""mechanics"" of God, the Universe, and you. It is basically the yogic model with Christianity, Taoism, Buddishm, etc. overlayed without conflict (afterall, Truth is Truth). Recommendations: read the book and then re-examine your own belief system.Warnings: do not try the yoga lock exercises mentioned in the book unless you have guidance from an experienced, trained yoga teacher."
2,This book us supposed to take place in season 5 shouldnt it have been sweet 15 then,This story has problems.First what 16 year old is in middle school? who edited this thing? secondly this story should be placed in season 6 after Buffy's death however I'm willing to bet it was completed before the finale of season 5 aired given that it takes place in season 5 why no glory? did the writer not want to deal with it. it was as if he got what he thought was a cute title and shoehorned Buffy into it like another person said the story didn't need any of the Buffyverse. they barley appear aside from the subplot which was better then the main story and the only reason this book was O.K.
3,Super Reader,"When patrolling, Buffy comes across a girl being threatened by a demon. However, the girl punches the demon and puts both her fists through it.Not a normal kid. Dawn ends up talking to her at school, and they eventually find out she has a demon father, who has some conqueror type plans for her rare superpowers."
2,Sub-par Buffy,"Buffy and friends become involved with Arianna, a troubled young woman on the cusp of sixteen whose abilities rival those of Buffy herself. They try to befriend her and discover the truth about her. Scott Ciencin knows how to write the characters and has a good grasp of the show's vernacular, but he is less successful at crafting a compelling story. Most annoying, he gives Arianna an ability that would allow her to easily resolve the tension and uncertainty that torments her, yet provides an excuse for not exercising it that is very flimsy and contrived. The humor leans toward the cute and lacks the bite that characterizes the best writing of the series. If this is the type of story that had appeared on air, Buffy would not have lasted seven seasons."
5,happy sweet 16th,"when dawn comes home with a new friend, buffy is shocked. she hadseen this girl on patrol a few nights before. the girl has amazing speed and power like a slayer but obviously is not one.the scooby gang take the girl under their wing and try to findout the source of her ability. the more they dig, the moresinister the plot is. because on her sixteenth birthday she willcome into her destiny which also includes killing the slayer. this book is very intriguing and leaves you waiting to the endto find the outcome. highly recommend."
5,Extra portable power.,I was tired of crawling under my desk to disconnect the power adapter for the camera platform. This works just like the original and I can keep it in the camera bag so that I can grab the camcorder from the docking platform and go.It has worked well for a year now and I am happy I didn't get discouraged from the other opinions.Works for me and I don't even have to think twice about packing all my gear.
2,Didnt Seem Kosher,I bought this for someone else; It felt hollow/lightweitght; did not seem to have the usual Heavy tranformer you are used to with the AC adapters. I dont have a followup If this thing broke or is in working condition; Find an alternative.
4,Great All Purpose Knife,"Very, sharp, well balanced. Very nice all around knife.I usually reach for this one first."
5,Use this knife all the time,"Probably one of our more popular kitchen purchases. We use it for just about everything. Well balanced and sharp. Not sure if it's meant to be used for everything, but that hasn't stopped us."
5,Kathy Henderson,this is a very good looking knife nicely balance an extremely sharp I would recommend to all my friends and family
2,Not My First Choice in a Knife,"I was somewhat disappointed in this knife for two reasons. First, the dimples do not prevent vegetables from sticking to the blade as promised. I found that potatoes and other vegetables were just as likely to adhere to the blade as they would with a traditional chef's knife. Second, this knife lacks what Wusthof calls a finger guard. On a traditional chef's knife this is the piece of steel that bulges out at the end of the blade near the handle. The finger guard serves two purposes, it protects the index finger and it adds heft and stability to the blade. Because this knife doesn't have a finger guard, the blade seems somewhat flimsy and unstable. I much prefer a chef's knife."
5,Fabulous knife!,We love this knife. Looked at department store sales and other sites online. Best price. Great size. Fast delivery!
5,THERE IS NO BETTER KNIFE!!!,"This has got to be the best knife I've ever had the pleasure of using. Bought it to complete the Wusthof set I recently bought, and it is my and my fiance's favorite. Watch your fingers, though -- this baby is SHARP!"
3,Much better options available for the same price point,"This is a decent knife. Just before I bought this knife, a friend of mine referred me to www.bladegallery.com For $70 you can get the hand-made Kobayashi Santoku which has a much better blade than this mass produced product. Another option is the Fujitsoru santoku. These are much better quality products -- no visibility because they are not mass distributed and promoted by the big chains.The folks at bladegallery (based in Seattle) are incredibly knowledgeable and helpful and they actually suggested a knife much lower than my budget as a superior alternative -- now that is refreshing in retail! Call them and they will carefully help you select what you need.This may sound like a sales pitch for them ...I have no vested interest whatsoever, just trying to help fellow consumers. You will realize that after you interact with them."
5,Awesome knife--I guess it should be for the price?,"I don't mean to complain about the price, it seems a tad high, but that's really my only complaint. Also, at first I was concerned this knife wouldn't be satisfactory because it's really really light. But, it's as stiff as can be and super sharp. The blade does go right up to the corner near your hand--many blades are purposely dulled in that area (maybe that's the way this sort of knife is supposed to be). Other than those minor concerns, the knife is really great. Definitely worthy of 5 stars. The seller (not Amazon) was very quick too."
5,Wicked Sharp,"This deal is wicked sharp. You could probably cut the nuts of a gnat with it. I choose to chop veggies with it though. It looks really cool. While it won't help you to score with chicks, it certainly can't hurt."
5,Excellent knife.,"Working as a prep cook I use many different types of knives and also cut many different types of meats, vegetables, fruits, ect. Of my entire knife set, my Wusthof Santoku is by far my favorite. The balance and how light it is as well as how well it fits into my hand makes it the perfect knife for cleaning the rhines of fruits, creating finely diced vegetables, or anything else that requires a lot of control. You can chop, rock, or use any type of cutting technique with this knife well, and I have absolutly no complaints about it.Obviously, for some things a heavier knife is required, and for that I have a Wusthof classic chef's knife, but I still use this more than any other."
5,One of my favorite cooking knives,"Very thin, straight profile (not wedge-like, as a chef's knife is). Also very stiff and rigid, so excellent for precisely cutting vegetables. Feels great in the hand, with enough heft to feel controllable, but not as unwieldy as a bigger, chef's knife can be (especially after you've been working with it for a while)."
5,I'm no chef...,"...and I don't even play one on TV. As an ordinary everyday-type cook, I value this knife second only to my 8"" chef's knife. The chef's knife remains the workhorse of my kitchen, but if I need a really fine mince or a very precise julienne, I grab the Santoku because it is easier to exercise very fine control in my unskilled hands. If your cooking is basic meat and potatoes, this knife may be overkill; but if you ever get that adventurous spirit and play around in the kitchen, you want it."
3,Why no bolster?,"This knife is a high quality knife, no doubt. It is sharp, keeps and edge well and cuts wonderfully. The only reason I give three stars instead of five is the lack of a bolster. For me this is a serious flaw. It make the knife less comfortable to use and less safe as well. Buy the hollow edge cooks knife instead."
5,Top Quality,I own this knife and this was a Christmas Gift. It arrived in plenty of time for Christmas and the WÃ¼sthof quality was a factor in my purchase.
4,An appreciated gift,"I gave this knife to my son, who is a culinary student. He is very satisfied with it."
2,Go Japanese,"There is no substitute for Japanese steel. Anything based on Yoshkin steel; I recommend Global.German steel is decent, don't get me wrong, but it's sub-par. I've gone through 2 sets of Henkels and was unimpressed. I've had my Globals for years and can't even consider a substitute. These things are so sharp, my girlfriend is too scared to even touch them."
4,Arrived with chipped blade...,"Arrived with obvious chips in the blade. Still sharp though...but that was a dissappointment. The 7in we ordered didn't have this 'feature'. Probably going to send it back, if we can..."
5,Versatile,"I love a good Santuko knife for their versatility. Wusthof delivers consistently excellent quality, durability, and design, and this knife is no different. This is a pretty basic Wusthof without a higher end handle, but it is great for everyday use in the kitchen of your average foodie!"
1,Bad vendor service,"Knife is great, but ordering experience not so. Received a double order and had to pay shipping and handling back to vendor in Canada. They wouldn't waive the handling fee. I have no clue how I could have double-ordered, and I've been ordering off the web for years. Order must not have good ""confirmation"" pane after placing order."
5,I love this knife!,"It is the only knife I use anymore, sharpens easily and the wide tip even makes it great for spreading peanut butter."
5,I will just be endorsing the other reviews...,"but this knife is fantastic. It is very very expensive, and there are cheaper alternatives, but if you want the best, this is it. An inexpensive but excellent alternative is the Komachi also sold here on Amazon.This knife is razor sharp and razor thin, allowing you to cut through vegetables like butter. The small grooves supposedly make it so the vegetables do not stick. Seems to work, although I rarely have that problem with the Komachi either without the grooves.We love it and use it almost daily, so that makes it worth the price.In fact, I loved it so much, I bought it as a gift for the two best cooks I know, and they love it too. :-)"
5,good seller,"I bought this product for a friend, so I can't vouch for its greatness, but she liked it a lot."
5,Highly Recommend!,"I wish she had come out with this method a couple of decades ago, and I could have enjoyed playing piano all along. I don't have 10 years of time to study in order to be able to play basic two handed songs. This was amazing. I really was able to play in such a short time. She was very clear and easy to understand. Even if you are taking regular piano lessons, a little instant gratification can sure help to motivate! Highly recommend!"
5,Great Teacher!,This is a gem. Ruth Lundell's method is quick and easy to use. It took me no time at all to play songs that people can sing to!
4,Bad Moon -- Scary!,"Last summer, I was going to my cousin's house to watch some videos. He said to get one from the local grocery store. I was browsing through the titles, when a movie called BAD MOON caught my eye. It looked really scary, and the special effects looked awesome too. I was right--it was both frightening and funny. Definitely one of the best werewolf movies ever.So if you're looking for a terrific, scary movie, don't pass up Bad Moon!"
3,Surprisingly Decent Film,"There are so few films in the horror film werewolf sub-genre. Moviegoers seem to prefer their movie monsters in the (lame) form of a quasi dead bisexual outfitted in black Dolce and trolling for sex and blood. Werewolves have always been the underdog (no pun intended). There are only a few really good films: American Werewolf in London, The Howling and The Wolf Man. While this film is no where near the exceptional work of the aforementioned it does stand on its own rather well. I don't want to give away the plot but the premise involves the typical guy gets bitten, becomes monster, attacks people, seeks cure. The difference is that the film doesn't become laden with the monster as victim angle (as emphasized by TWM) and the film's hero is an unlikely and ironic one. The werewolf attacks are brutal and bloody. The only drawback to the film is that it does carry an odd LifeTime movie quality to it."
4,Here doggie doggie.,I enjoyed Bad Moon simply because it was one of those horror flicks that was not afraid to show the monster for any length of time. Even The Howling didn't give us any long looks at the werewolves.
3,I liked SILVER BULLET better.,"Good for a one time watch, I don't think it could stand up for repeat viewings mainly because the story perspective is what makes it unique the first time around, but also because of the stiff performances by absolutely everybody...except for the dog. He's great! The two main leads acted like rigor mortis was setting in. The uniqueness I was talking about is how a lot of the story is from the dog's point of view and how he knows the family is in danger from a werewolf but nobody understands what the hell he's trying to get at and why he's suddenly freaking out all the time.The werewolf effects are pretty cool especially for 1996. And we can't forget the brief but tasty female nudity at the beginning (not by Mariel Hemingway thank god)...nice. The main actor guy also takes his shirt off a few times if anybody cares."
3,Bad Moon,"Certainly not ""The Howling"" of the 90s, but a stylish, entertaining little romp none-the-less. Mariel Hemingway (yes, daughter of good ol' Ernest) stars as a single mother who allows her strange brother to park his trailer and live by her home. Yet, once little bro (Michael Pare) begins to settle in, a werewolf starts to tear everyone to pieces. Surprisingly, these quickie provides some decent character development, good special effects, and respectable cinematography. Although this formula has been used, recycled, re-done so many times, ""Bad Moon"" proves that not all is lost when another werewolf picture is released. Director: Eric Red. Cast: Mariel Hemingway, Michael Pare. Rated R for violence, gore, nudity, sexual situations, and profanity. 83 minutes."
2,"A decent effort, but. . .","I had read the novel that this movie was based on and found this adaptation to be somewhat lacking. The novel is ""Thor"" and was written by Wayne Smith. It is told almost entirely from Thor's point of view and is actually quite charming. I realize that many things work better in print than they would in film and that sacrifices have to be made in any screenplay adaptation, but the majority of the novel is told from Thor's point of view and is about his reaction to this bizarre situation that only he is aware of but cannot understand. The makers of this movie tried to capture some of the point of view but I ultimately they failed. Try and track down the book (I think it's no longer in print) and compare it to the movie. You'll see what I mean."
4,A underrated Werewolf Film.,"When a man (Micheal Pare) gets biting by a Werewolf in Arfica. Weeks later... He goes to visit his sister (Mariel Hemingway) and her son (Mason Gamble) but when the Family Dog named Thor (Primo) sense the man, that`s he`s not himself but a Werewolf. The Dog has to Protect his Family from Him.Directed by Eric Red (Writer of The Hitcher, Near Dark & Body Parts) made a Short but Terrific Horror Thriller. Good Performances by the Lead, including The Dog, which is Great. A Flop at the Box Office but Thanks to the Cinematography:Jan Kiesser and directing make this one a Cult Hit on Video. Based on the Novel by Wayne Smith. Clairmont-Scope. Grade:A-."
3,You should've listened to the dog!,"Michael Pare' gives a good performance as uncle Ted. An explorer/adventurer who is attatcked by a werewolf on an expedition, he survives and heads back to the states where he moves onto his sisters property and begins a killing spree of his own. No one suspects a thing except the family dog, Thor, and no one listens to him. Good for it's type, The effects are campy and everyone plays it pretty straight. Best scene involves Pare' Peeing on the dog house to mark his territory. Three and a half stars. Could use some extra features."
4,"""Thor"", the hero of the movie!","This movie was very enjoyable for me. Though the story was a bit sad, it was worth watching. I love dogs and in my opinion, they are truly man's best friend."
1,Not Just Bad Moon...Bad Movie,"I'm a fan of werewolf flicks, but Bad Moon was just unwatchable. Michael Pare stars as Ted, an out of work photographer who becomes a werewolf when he is infected with lycanthropy in South America. After the attack, he moves back to Oregon and his sister invites him to stay with her.While I liked the idea of Bad Moon, it suffered from some of the worse acting I've ever seen in a horror film. Ted and his sister's lines were abominable and were delivered with the emotional quality of vulcans. Plus, I thought the lengthy and involved sex scene in the movies opener rather unnecessary.I'm giving this movie 1 star. And that's being kind. If you want a decent werewolf films watch Dog Soldiers or read Bitten by Armstrong. This film was sub par."
3,"Nice wolf, BAD end.","I have to admit the werewolf looked capital, and got some good screen time but... aparently cool looks aside being a werewolf grants a person LESS in the department of physical abilities than a normal muscular human.I don't want to give away the ending but I have to include it in my werewolf hall of shame. It made me shake my head in sadness for all werewolves everywhere.Overall though an ok werewolf movie. Three stars for the wolf alone."
4,A good werewolf movie.,"If you're looking for a good werewolf movie, I recommend BAD MOON. This movie has a story different from most. If you want alot of killing, this movie is not for you. I give it 4 stars because of the unnecessary sex scene at the beginning to gain a R rating. Otherwise it would of been good date movie for teens."
2,Results Rule! has a distracting writing style that makes it hard to read,"It could be that this book has good information in it. I don't know. Because in every other paragraph it shows me how ""Results Rule!""Yes, the title is splashed around, as if this is proper grammar. It's otherwise clearly written, but this guy fell in love with his title, and I will never read another book by Mr. Pennington again, for fear that he does it in all his books."
2,Left wanting more...,"Overall, I did enjoy reading this book. I'm not sure though that I would recommend it to a friend. I didn't feel a deep connection with any of the characters for the most part. I was intrigued to see what would end up happening, so I found it to be a page-turner. There was a lot of botany involved in which plants were referred to by their genus-species name. I don't feel that was a necessity to the main plot."
2,2-D characters,"A few parts were interesting, but not enough to hold the story together. I strongly agree with the reviewer who said she didn't feel a deep connection to the characters. The character development was lacking. I won't be passing this on to anyone. A botanist might find it worth the price. I didn't."
2,There must be better footage than this?!,"I'm pretty disappointed with this video. For starters, I wish that Hudson Music could've provided better audio/video examples of Rufus ""Speedy"" Jones (poor audio), Elvin Jones (not enough), Sonny Payne (poor video) and Chico Hamilton (not enough). Maybe it wasn't possible to get better examples, but i don't see the point watching a video where it's next to impossible to make out Sonny Payne's stick-twirling display while he solos. I also wished that Hudson Music played a few bars of music from each act leading into the drum solo, rather than have the drum solo already underway as the video appears. The drum battles were very short and for the most part a waste (they almost always are). Highlights for me included the Buddy Rich (not the bit with Jerry Lewis), Louie Bellson, Joe Morello and Sam Woodyard solos. I'm glad i didn't pay the retail price for this."
3,All Rich and Bellson,"Great tape but too much of Bellson and Rich.Rufus ""Speedy"" Jones has the best solo.Too bad there's no Max Roach or Kenny Clarke.Not enough Elvin Jones.Very inspirational though. Wish it was longer."
1,poorly done,I expected more for the price. I would have thought this came from the $5.00 basket from Wal-Mart. I returned it to Amazon for 1/2 the price of what I paid for it. It is just a copy of old films cuts poorly copied to DVD. This is not digitally enhanced. Stay away from Hudson Music unless you are a music history enthuses who wants the old film cuts for record keeping.
3,Great part needs to come with hardware,This part fit perfectly. I do not like people who leave low star numbers and rave about the product. However the regulator fit perfectly on my 1997 Ford Crown Victoria.It has to be a known fact as I have replaced three of these that Ford used rivits to hold the window to the regulator and the bottom of the regulator to the door. This kit does not come with new rivits or bolts.I personally used bolts as rivits are mostly for manufactures to save cost. This part however should come with four bolts to replace the drilled out rivits. It would not cost much more and would make it faster to replace.
5,what's the difference Between this set and ASIN: B000026OW3,I find that the item ASIN: B000026OW3 is cheaper than this set. The CD set is IMPORT. Does someone know the difference?Thanks
1,A Very Poor Textbook.,"In taking an Engineering Electromagnetics course, I was very disappointed with the instruction of the course; therefore I turned to this textbook for help. Unfortunately, this book is packed with errors, both in the text, and more commonly the end of chapter problems. For such a theoretical subject, the explanation is lacking, and example problems are few and far between. In addition, there are no answers in the back of the book, and the answers available online or on CD-ROM are not all correct, according to my professor. Sigh. All in all, these factors combined to make this a very difficult course, the worst that I have had in my 3.5 years of engineering education."
4,"Thin, sharp, and precise","I just added this knife to my Wusthof collection. I arrived extremely sharp, and is nice for semi-fine work. Activities like dicing shallots, which are too small for a large 8 inch knife and to big for a paring knife, are nice with this knife. Be careful though, the tip of the blade is quite thin, and will not stand up to abuse."
5,Another Excellent Knife from WÃ¼sthof,"I bought this knife for my dad a few weeks ago (for fathers' day). He uses it almost exclusively in place of his older knives now! The 6-inch design is a perfect length for almost any job, too.When I was researching, a good number of people said that it was not multi-functional enough to be worth the price. I found that the knife definitely has some things it does better than others, but it still does a fine job cutting vegetables; the taller blade does optimize it for sandwiches and such, but does great with many utility knife jobs."
4,Fun to watch....,"I enjoyed this film. The director throws in a monkey-wrench once in a while, changes the plot and surprises you. A bit crazy when the aliens and the robot enter the story. Obviously dubbed from the Spanish. I'm giving this 4-stars."
3,"Good, but not Great. Needs more detail/info","I bought this map/book because I was looking for a detailed map of the city. It's a good map of downtown , but it doesn't get down to complete street level, and it cuts off a good part of the outlying neighborhoods that Chicago encompasses.If you're going to make a map of Chicago, you should really include the whole thing. Let's Go, Inc. cuts off parts of wicker park, ukrainian village, and logan square, and parts of the north side. It concentrates too much on the near downtown area, and forgets about some worthwhile neighborhoods that people might want to visit or look for homes in."
3,Black African slavery did not begin with the Atlantic trade,"Anderson and Holley rightly tackle a topic that deserves study, however, they de-emphasize the well-developed Islamic slave trade that kidnapped more than 11 million Black Africans from their homes between 700 to 1900. This slave trade began centuries before the Atlantic trade and continued for centuries after. Islamic scripture fully embraces the institution of human slavery. Mohammed left many instructions to slaveowners. This express endorsement of human slavery by Mohammed accounts for the fact that human slavery was not abolished in Saudi Arabia until 1964 and not until 1968 in Kuwait. Islamic slavery was no less brutal than the Atlantic variety. Males slaves were routinely castrated and forced into military service.Female slaves become sexual servants whose children were not their own."
2,Disappointed,"Since I first saw Angelina Jolie in 'Gia' a few years ago, I have been a big fan of her work. I am consistently impressed with her talent, honesty, silliness and beauty.As an introduction to her work/ life, this book was great. However, any average fan (as most of the buyers are i'm sure) will already have read everything in this book from various past interviews.It appears, that in her rush to capitalize on Jolie's fame, all Kathleen Tracy has done is link together numerous interviews into a novel format. I was disappointed to stumble across mispellings and grammatical errors that were obvious on the first read through.One redeeming quality: a great selection of pictures"
2,100 magazine articles,Why oh why did i buy this book? Oh yes... in a fit of madness i fell in love with angelina jolie and spent too much money on her dvd's and this book. I wish I had read marcia's review... this book has a gorgeous cover but inside is just a compilation of magazine articles and speculation. i would have given the book one star- but threw in the extra one for the highschool pics of angelina and this color pic that makes her look like a housewife. However if I were you- i wouldn't waste your money on this book for the pictures because there's not many. then again- we all have to learn from our own mistakes right?
1,Pleasantly surprised,"I have taken NyQuil, Ambien, Lunesta in an effort to cure my chronic insomnia to no avail. Upon finding this book I have found my cure. And it generally takes but a paragraph. Few books that I have come across in my years reading biographies yield as little depth as this one. I was shocked at how little actual information the author was able to provide - and it was almost as if she based her bio on a couple of movies and the wikipedia page. Stunning lack of detail."
3,What We Already Know,"How can person write a biography without speaking to the person you are writing about? Giving a summary of past articles, which may or may not be true, is not a biography. I have to agree with the other reviewer's, which I read their reviews, and still purchased the book. In the end, each person has to make up their own mind. I thought too much emphasis was placed on other people and places. Hopefully one day, Angelina Jolie will write her own book!, it would give more insight into the real person, and not the ""Hollywood"" person."
3,dissapointed,This book has decent pictures but if you have read one or two articals on Angelina Jolie then you know all the information already. If you are a true fan then there are absolutly no surprises. I was very dissapointed.
3,Good photos,"If you are a fan of Angelina, this book will not tell you anything you do not already know. Very poorly written, the author obviously threw this book together in a quick attempt to cash in on the AJ craze. However, I did enjoy the photos, they make a nice addition to your collection. If you'd like to get to know AJ a little better, try the book Angelina Jolie's Journals: Notes From My Travels, written by Angelina herself. She takes you behind the scenes for a personal look at her work as an ambassador."
2,Not such a good book on angie...........,"The only good thing in this Book are the photo's of Angelina. Some are B&W some a in full color. The book really has nothing ""new"" on angie. I have a feeling the author just wanted to cash in on Angie's sucess, since she is soooo big in tomb raider right now.Not a Good Book. Not really a Bio on Angie. It's filled with issues we already knew on angie....."
2,Check it out at the library! Don't buy!,"I was disappointed by this book in that there were no interviews with, no collaboration from Ms. Jolie that would make this book original or even different. If you've read a few magazine articles about A.J., then you know everything this book could tell you. The pictures were the most interesting, I think Tracy could have made it all photos and it would have been worth the purchase."
3,i just love angelina,"i bought this book cuz i gotta own everything that involves her, the book didnt give me any new information it was just a regurigatation of past interviews and film reviews. there was some very beautiful pictures tho. i say buy this book if your a fan, its worth having."
5,"Exceptional performance, value, and edge retention","Designed for broad kitchen use, the flat-ground spear-point vanadium blade is thin and semi-flexible, which allows it to pass easily through both soft and fibrous foods. It's ground from a high performance molybdenum and vanadium stainless blank to take and hold a long-lasting edge. The blade is tapered, starting thick where the blade joins the handle, thinning down the spine to a fine, uniformly ground tip. In the hand the knife conveys a unique feeling of balance, or ""sweet spot."" The sweet spot is due to the blade and handle being comparable in weight. This balance transfers into a feeling of steady control over the cutting edge.As a result, I rate it second only to the 4.5-inch (Wusthof) utility knife, which carries the same blade with a slightly longer handle. This 4-inch paring knife carries high customer satisfaction over its lifetime."
4,Quality,"A good, sharp, easy to handle knife for common kitchen chores. You will be amazed how quickly and efficiently you can work with the right tools."
3,Tampa Bay Devil Rays 5950 Pro Hat,"Be careful, I kept linking on the picture show for the Tampa Bay DevilRays 2007 Alternate Road hat (Green bill with a Black top) and theysent me the all black hat, not once but twice. I finally had to orderthe correct hat over the phone."
2,His voice aside this doesn't fly,aside from Seal's voice this song just doesn't fly to me on a whole.it never catches fire.
2,frustrated,over 400 pages of what appears to be good stuff. Why isn't there a table of contents or a workable index of subjects? You have to begin on page one - am I missing something or is this a flaw of the Kindle edition. It is a monumental problem.
2,Unbelievable and Disappointing,"I am disappointed in this book as it had potential to be unique mystery, and I do not quite understand how it earned itself a spot on the NYT Best Sellers list. I found the heroine of the book not very credible, and in fact too down right stupid to be believed. The harrowing moments in the book are brought about not by the sharp inquisitive mind of someone who is supposed to be a decorated officer, but a bumbling ditz who I put the clues together for half way through the book. Predictable to a fault, (which makes it harder and harder to identify with the main characters), the ""whodunnit"" environment drones with all the usual suspects and a formula that's been played out in every Scooby Doo cartoon. I found myself skipping through the last chapters just to get to the end."
4,Surprisingly Good!!,"I usually don't read ""romantic mysteries"" because they can be too much sweetness and not enough suspense. This book had plenty of suspense, which made me keep reading into the wee hours of the morning. I especially enjoyed reading about the Amish, as I have had several opportunities to visit places around the country where they live. I really enjoyed Kat Lindley, and I hope we find out more about her future life in the Amish community. If you liked this book, also read PLAIN TRUTH by Jodi Picoult. This is a mystery set in the Amish country of Pennsylvania."
4,Lots of excitement...,"Kat felt it her duty as a policewoman and as a person to investigate, obliquely, when she suspected a little boy was being abused. That cost her when the father shot her, making her shooting hand ineffectual.Months later, rehabilitation behind her, Kat starts a new life near Amish country. Someone is out to get these peaceful folk; pranks are becoming dangerous. Investigating will require Kat to become Katie, an Amish girl from another community there as betrothed to Luke, a handsome widower. As she delves into the community, a new world is opened to her. She also begins to feel things she never expected to for a man who is not part of her world. Things become dangerous, both for her heart and life.**** For a book set in a peaceful farm village, Dark Harvest has lots of excitement. In this cultural clash a sweet and thrilling romance is the result. ****(...)"
2,Copycat Story,"I have read two or three undercover Amish cop stories, including ""Witness"". There is nothing original in the concept here. The story drags on and on. There is so much unnecessary detail I felt the book would never end. Some of the things that happen just aren't believable. The book is described as a suspense. It is not very suspenseful at all. I really didn't care who was caught, I just wanted it to end!!!Don't bother!"
2,Dark Harvest,"While I have liked other books by this author, this one just didn't seem credible. I read about half of it and decided it was not worth the time."
4,Ellen Foster,"My students had read the novel Ellen Foster, and as a reward and to prompt discussion I showed them the movie. It followed the novel closely, a good family-friendly film. I showed it three weeks ago, and just two days ago, the public library called to tell me that their copy was finally in and for me to come pick it up. Thank goodness for Amazon!"
3,"left alone in thec world, Ellen finds her new family","A drunken father, a mad grandmother and a sick mother combinewith a legal system that is blind to justice for a child.The little thin weak girl is stronger in spiritthan the system that plagues her life of dying and failing relatives.First her mother dies and then she finds refuge with her art teacherand her husband, but the court puts her in the home of herstrange bitter grandmother who also dies.Taken in by her aunt she finds that relatives like theseare very like Harry Potter's Uncle, Aunt their son,which makes her find her own way in the end..."
3,Powerful,"Ellen Foster based on the novel by Kaye Gibbons, is a story about a girl who just wants a place to call home. It's emotional and has you crying several times througout. It's not one of the best movies I've seen but it is a good movie that leaves a powerful impact. I as a viewer would be more inclined to rent it or get it out of the library than purchase it. It's really not a movie that you can watch over and over."
2,"Mediocre family film, but a complete disgrace to the book!","The movie was much less impactful, much less meaningful, and generally much less compelling than the book. Ellen's various guardians in the film deserve Nobel Peace Prizes in comparison to their characters in the book. Jena Malone as Ellen Foster did well for a TV-film actress, otherwise the acting was mediocre. The only people I would recommend this film to are those with kids (8-12) who can't bear the thought of reading and aren't likely to change their minds once they reach ages 13 and up; the book is a bit explicit for children under 13. Basically, you're comparing the book Oliver Twist to your typical small-screen/straight-to-video cheesy drama. Angels in the Endzone is what pops into my head, but that's just my opinion on a different film."
1,The movie was horrible.,"The movie was horrible. The book was ten times better than the movie, if you want a good movie, get American History X. This was the worst movie I have ever seen!"
5,Great Movie,"Received product on time and the packaging was great. Movie played great, no skips or spinning. Would recommend this seller and would purchase from them again."
2,A Decade Too Late,"This Dvd had a lot of Promise: A Great selection of Songs from a Legendary Band, Ronald Isley is One of the Best Singers in Soul History, and Ernie is Wonderful on Guitar...However, The Concert here is lacking; Ronald's Pipes, though holding up well for Someone in His early 60's are not what they used to be. He struggles on the high notes, of which there are many, and He does the James Brown trick of employing many Stage Dancers too obfuscate His own decline...The Dancers appear too often, and clutter the Stage, and Ronald overdoes the Mr. Biggs routine; too much ""Show"" and too little Musicality shining through. The Band is Fine, but there is little muscle to the rythm section, and the ending number, ""fight the Power"" is bogged down by chanting and an almost Disco instrumentation, not the Meaty Licks found on the Recording; Avoid this One and put on Your ""Ultimate Isleys"" CD, You'll be far more satisfied.."
3,Isley Brothers summer breeze,THE DVD HAS GREAT COLOR THE MUSIC IS FINE THE DANCERS ARE OK;BUT RON ISLEY NEEDS TO RECORD IN THE STUDIO AND LEAVE LIVEPERFORMANCES TO THE YOUNG FOLKS WHO CAN BREATHE AND SING AT THESAME TIME. HE HAD SUCH A WONDERFUL VOICE BUT SEEMED OUT OF BREATH AND COULDNT HIT THE HIGH NOTES IT WAS VERY NOTICABLE ANDEVEN THE DANCERS AND BACK GROUND SINGERS COULDNT HELP HIM. ERNIE NEEDS TO FIND HIMSELF ANOTHER LEAD SINGER.
2,Disappointment,"After being a long time Isley fan, I treated myself to what seemed like a greatest hits DVD. Ron's voice was ok, but just no energy, very ho hum like. Ernie played ok, but for a live show, I thought he would of ripped the strings like on Who's that Lady or Summer Breeze.Maybe there's an older DVD concert of them out there??"
2,Save Your Money,"When this DVD was purchased, I thought it was ""The Isley Brothers"". I guess I didn't read the cover carefully enough because you get what you pay for, I guess. As indicated on the cover, you see Ron and Ernest Isley and that's exactly who you get -- Not the Isley Brothers, the group. This DVD also shows several over-aged female dancers who look like they should be at home with their kids rather than dancing on stage. I was very disappointed and not impressed with this DVD at all. I will rate this DVD with two stars, at best. You should save your money and buy a DVD with the ""original"" Isley Brothers or use your money to buy some other DVD."
2,No energy whatsoever,"I didn't have any Isleys live performances on DVD before I bought this, and this one was terrible. I had seen them in person, and they were good. This seems like a concert they squeezed in, because obviously no energy or no effort was put out there. The Isleys should have never put this one on DVD. The crowd wasn't lively either, so I am guessing they fed off of one another."
1,THIS IS NOT A LIVE ALBUM! BEWARE!!,"I was totally disappointed! I love the Isley Brothers and I have a lot of their albums, including three of their greatest hits cds. However, I was very disappointed to find out that I had all of these songs on this album and found out that this was not a live cd. BUYERS BEWARE!!"
4,Intimate Concert Footage,"Good DVD to showcase this group in a small venue setting. I've been to their outdoor concerts and they've done a great job there, too. But this is nice!"
1,Disappointed,I have e-mailed your company more then once and have not got a clear response About this DVD the Isley Brothers.I have bought alot of items from your company and you have always sent me a notice of when items was being ship/mailed.I have emailed you and told you I did not receive a notice for this item and that the other two items I did receive a notice. I have ordered all three items at the same time and did receive the other two but not this one. Would appreciate response to this matter its been a couple of months sense I ordered the item.
3,My opinion,I wanted to buy this watch for my wife but she told that it look like as a usual bangle. I am glad that I didn't buy this watch :-). It is only my opinion.
4,I have no idea what multitudinous means...,"...but I would probably just say ""many"".Unlike Carter Rila, the author of this book is direct and to the point. A very good overview of US forces, weapons, equipment and uniforms in one nifty volume. Not a detailed guide by any means, and only a starting point for serious research - but as a quick and dirty guide to US troops in the Med, a nice little book.Chappel's artwork is excellent; it was a shame the Singapore version shipped with charcoal sketches by the publisher's son. The Chappel prints are much nicer."
1,poor service from seller,"My battery arrived as advertised, however, it was defective. Batteryheads replaced it, but the second was defective as well. Though they did refund the cost of the item, they did not reimburse me for shipping nor for the time and inconvenience of not having a functional battery."
3,A Bit Disappointed,"After reading reviews bemoaning the fact that Henkels were now being manufactured in China, I decided to try Wustof's line and, hopefully, enjoy the quality of German steel and production. When the set arrived, I immediately noticed the lack of heft that is so apparent with Henkels. The Wustof blades are very sharp and appear to be of good quality, but the handles are a disappointment, not as substantial or comfortable as Henkels. If I weren't comparing them to an admittedly higher line of Henkels, I would probably be satisfied with the quality and price of this set. When you're used to a BMW, it's hard to settle for a Volkswagen."
3,Ok quality,"Wusthof Gourmet 7-Piece Knife Set with Block:The quality of the knives are ok! They are light weight and thin (if your hand get tired easily with heavy knives these prefect for you). They are not as shape as I expected or described...little disappointed! But, i guess they are ok knives for home cook. I bought one French knife from another company which has a better quality..the weight, shapness and right thickness of the knife are just prefect for me! if ever need another set of knives i would look for other brands."
1,You will NOT get what's pictured in the product description!,"I have a Wusthof Classic that's been sharpened so many times (a decade of daily use), it's come time to replace it. Saw this deal, saw the Classic line in the pictures and ordered.What was pictured is NOT what was received!Don't be fooled. This is not the Classic set, it's the cheap stamped out set, and because of it, this isn't a deal. A stamped knife is a stamped knife. It's cheap, light, can't hold an edge and while not really bad, is not something you want to use every day for years and years.It's a disgrace for Amazon to picture a different product in anothers product description, but it's my fault for trusting them with it and not simply reading reviews and making sure I'm getting what I think I'm getting."
1,Lightweight and Cheap Feel,I bought these knives after reading many reviews and comparing these knives to other brands. UPS delivered the knives and I opened the set and in an instant knew I would return the set ASAP. These knives have plastic handles that are lightweight and feel cheap. The blades seemed flimsy and were thin. I expected more and will now go to a store to feel the knives in my hand before another purchase.
2,Expected Better from Wusthof,"The title sums up this review. I would never have expected Wosthof to make a product such as this. These knife are stamp instead of ground, light weight, and overall not what was expected."
3,Good knives,"I had a Henckel paring knife and expected Wusthof to be comparable; theses knives seem lower quality but still good. The Logo appears to be a decal and I could have removed it easily and the handles are a lightweight plastic, so they don't have the ""feel"" I associated with a quality knife. I have not used them yet, but I think they will be serviceable for a while and the price was good. I got mine at Crate and Barrel for $79 last week, but that must have been a holiday special because today they are selling there today for $129."
5,Love to Chop,"I wore out our kitchen aid knife set we got as a wedding present and started to look for a new set online. Found this set on sale and took a chance and bought it. One of the best purchases for my kitchen yet. Do yourself a favor and buy yourself a set of good kitchen knifes, I had no idea how dull my old ones were until these babies came!"
3,exchanged,"We weren't paying attention when we purchased this set. We already own an 8"" and a 10"" wusthof knife, The major difference in the gourmet and the classic, to us anyway, is the weight. The classic is a heavier knife than the gourmet, and that is what we are used to. The gourmet to my wife and I felt totally different,and our knives are used everyday, all day. The ones we already own are at least 15 years old and are still spectacular knives."
2,Good value but not durable,"I have had this knife set for about 18 months, and while at first they seemed like a good value for a name-brand knife, unfortunately the handles have broken for the paring and utility knives, cracked across the rivets. Also, the Wusthof emblem on the handles is just a cheap paper sticker that will fall off after a few passes through the dishwasher.Other than the handles breaking, I like the selection of tools for a casual cook like myself. The chef knife is a good size and shape, the bread knife works well, and the scissors are sharp, tough, and easy to clean. They could all probably hold a better edge, but I have found them easy to sharpen.Also, the knife block itself has three extra slots for other knives to be added, which is nice especially when the handles break on the originals.Conclusion: if not for the broken handles, I would be very satisfied and the value of this knife set. As I said, it is inexpensive and does the job for the casual cook."
2,Useable... but could have been a lot better.,"These knives were a little flimsier than I expected. I had previously handled some Wusthof Classics in the store and and these are no where near that quality and feel. But they do their job decently I suppose. Another thing is that the red Wusthoff logo on the handle is a sticker that EASILY washes off... possibly because Wusthoff does not want to be so easily associated with these knives?As some other reviews have previously mentioned, these are stamped knives rather than forged. I would ultimately suggest that you spend a little extra money and get full satisfaction from forged knives instead of purchasing these."
2,It Looks Like a Knock-Off,"I bought this set figuring the knives would come with quality, heavy blades. I bought one (not a set, just a chef's knife) about 10 years ago & it's good for a lifetime of use. These will only last about five years, I think, because they used very lightweight and thin steel. The handles are okay & the blade goes through the grip as one piece. That and the block are the only quality features. Because the blades are very sharp, it cuts fairly well but requires more force than a heavier blade.It's okay for the money but don't buy thinking it's top quality -- it isn't. Another great company hits the crap per."
3,Look before you leap...,"Improper wording in the product description: These are NOT forged pieces. They are stamped steel. If you expect forged metal, you'll be disappointed.That said, the steel these knives are made from is some very good stuff. If you want a nice budget-priced set of knives that should be plenty good for home use, these are good. Most household kitchen work doesn't necessitate forged cutlery - and unless you're the next Bourdain or Bobby Flay, these will probably suit you just fine (actually, most of the better chefs don't care if it's stamped or forged, as long as it's SHARP). Stamped or forged, Wusthof still makes excellent steel that holds an edge better than anything I've seen come out of China.So, other than the borderline-fraudulent wording in the description (please fix this, Amazon), these knives are a very good value - and have been a welcome addition to our kitchen."
1,Terrible quality; handles break,"I would not recommend these knives. Almost all of the handles broke within 6 months of use, either in the dishwasher or when dropped. I am very surprised because this is a known brand, but these knives must be their low-end entry in their product line. Too bad, because after this experience I will never buy this brand again."
5,Are they sharp? Have a bandage ready!!,"I received the knives,opened the box, wife used one of the knives, sliced her finger! These are very sharp knives and they hold an edge. Haven't found one problem with them yet. Look good, fit well in hand. Got them at a great price also. Best set of knives I have ever owned."
2,I didnt like it.,This book is very hard to read. The whole book is old english and the plot is kinda boring. I couldnt get into it. I love forever knight but this book was pretty bad.
4,I loved this book,"This is the best of the Nick Knight books I've read. It is a very clever recreation of the Globe Theater and the Shakespearean scene. If you liked the movie Shakespeare in Love, you'll like this book. It's also very funny in the sections about the new vampire Vauchon, who has no proper vampire standards and horrifes the older, traditional vampires who are settled into important political jobs. Best of all, it gives a wonderful view of Nick and Janette in the Elizabethan world. I hope we hear more from the author."
1,It was just bad!,"This book was the WORST F.K. book. The style of writing just does not suit this day and age. I think most people would not want to read it in that style! I sure would not! You can make comments to it and the time period, but just don't make the setting of the entire book about it!"
1,Absolutely Unreadable,"I thought Susan Garrett's FK ""fan novel"" was so poorly plotted and written that I wondered how it ever got published and gave it a ""2"". But this novel-by-teamwork effort, ""These Our Revels"", was an unmitigated disaster and despite a serious go at getting through this monotonous, lifeless mess that had so little to do with the FK universe I inhabit daily, in the end I tossed it in the trash (around page 84, I believe). Won't someone--PLEASE!--write another good FK novel as that done by Susan Sizemore in ""A Stirring of Dust""? I also highly recommend Nigel Bennett's delightful, engrossing novel,""Keeper of the King."""
3,initially difficult to get into,"If you delight in Shakespeare, you will probably like this book a lot. For myself, it was much slower moving than the other two Forever Knight novels, and therefore harder for me to get into. The authors are very good at recreating the time of Shakespeare, and what society was like then; there are many, many details that enrich the reading experience. But it is definitely not a fast read, unless you're the type who is able to race through plays like Hamlet, not bothering too much with the details."
2,Not too good,"One fun thing about Forever Knight is the way that Nick always weaves the past into the present. The whole ""those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it"". This book spent the entire time in the past so several characters were not able to appear. I also thought the book was way too carried away on putting ""Thees and Thous"" in and neglecting minor things like plot."
2,I couldn't finish it...,"I hate to say this, but I really couldn't finish this book. I tried and tried, but it was just so uninteresting to me, I couldn't. Don't get me wrong - I'm a HUGE fan of Forever Knight and watch the series faithfully(okay, obsessively ;)), but this book just didn't appeal to me. I commend the authors for all of their incredible flashback research and all of the hard work they put into it, but in the end, the novel really had no plot. There wasn't as much Vachon/Nick interaction as I wanted, and I felt like it was just night after night after night in London, and no real point to the book than to show Nick was friends with William Shakespeare and he visited the Globe Theatre. That's all great, but.... where's the plot?I am in no way insulting the authors' writing ability, but I think there could have been more of a story within _These Our Revels_ and maybe some suspense and mystery. There was none."
5,By far the best composer ever,"I do not have this CD, but the one I have has all these songs on it. Beethoven was a genius. Symphony #9 is the best composition ever created. If one song can give you chills continuously, the composer had something special. Play this music to your children, they will thank you for it later. Play it for yourself you will be a much more relaxed person."
3,"Sorry, Wusthof","When it comes to knives, I am an unabashed Wusthof fan. When we get to carving forks, however, there is a problem. This is a beautiful, superbly-made fork that will ably perform any conceivable task. However, Calphalon makes one that is every bit as functional for about one-fifth the price. This is when I must sadly say, ""Sorry, Wusthof, but no can do.""."
5,"A different, and welcome addition to my Christmas CD collection","I received my copy of this CD today and as I write this I am listening to it and thoroughly enjoying it. I had ""Past Three O'Clock"" by James Galway and frankly like this version better. ""The Holly She Bears a Berry"" is beautiful. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who has a variety of Christmas music. It makes for a great change-of-pace."
4,Mostly right on and a nice change from the usual.,"This is a really good representation of Irish folk music that just happens to have a somewhat holiday theme. I would have given five stars except for Rickie Lee Jones awful, awful, caterwauling rendition of O Holy Night--and I did used to like her. I'm also not a huge fan of the fast-talking Irish music genre which I know has a name, but it escapes me--there are a couple of tracks of those as well."
5,first up Thanksgiving every year.,"The world-renowned Irish intrumentalists do Christmas right. Guest vocalists include Jackson Browne, Rickie Lee Jones and Elvis Costello, among others. Browne's original composition ""The Rebel Jesus"" is a bit topical, but stays stylishly in bounds. It doesn't get any better than this selection of traditional and contemporary songs. Usually the first one played on Thanksgiving Day"
5,So excellent ... all year ...,"This is one of my top ten albums (DVDs), and I listen to it thru the year. FWIW, I'm an Atheist, but this is great stuff, and I don't mind listening to Christian music, if you want to think of this that way. There are meaningful pieces, and there are upbeat pieces, and for the most part it's joyful. This is quality all the way ... from the thoughtful to the rummy pub with a fire going and snow falling. It's great, even in the summer, even for an atheist. One of the best. I've sent this as gifts, and my original copy is on vinyl ... we go back a bit."
5,SAW THERE XMAS CONCERT IN 1991 !!!!!!,"Was lucky to get tickets for there Palm Springs, CA concert and also purchesed the cd ""The Bells of Dublin"" it is now a regular holiday habbit that we listen to it always. As a fact it is so well used that I am going to replace it with a cd, so that it can get a lot more use in my car. You can help but enjoy this type of music if you are any part of Irish."
4,Good set of knives,"Good value for money, the handles are a little small but other that that they are a good set of knives, they seem to stay sharp."
5,"Wusthof Classic says it all. Great knives, we will use for years.","Wonderful knives. Now all we need is a block to store them in. Well made and the handle weight is very comfortable. I'm not a knife expert, but I do like quality items and these get my vote."
3,Original and well-written,"While fairy tale retellings are nothing new, it's always a pleasure to find one that truly takes a familiar story and makes it extraordinary. Harrison's tale is centered not on the evil queen or her beautiful victim, but on the queen's enslaved accomplice, her magic mirror. It doesn't hurt that the cover art is eye-catching, either, so I must look for more stuff by Lori Koefoed. Harrison has another book listed with Amazon that looks like a good realistic teen novel, but I hope she continues in the vein of Mira."
4,A GREAT story!!!,"This was a really great story that almost anyone can learn a good lesson from. I read it in about two days! It puts a new face on the witch queen in Snow White and of course, the magic mirror. It'll make you laugh AND cry!"
2,A Teens Review,"I got this book because I was looking for a well writen yaoi manga not a novel with badly developed characters and almost no plot. The two main characters are constantly having sex and dont really have any other relationship between them. the few parts in the book without sex are just leading up to more of it and are badly written and short (not to mention shallow).There was one part that was almost well writen and ,yes, the sex is erotic if crude. However some of the phrases are used over more than once and it gets motonous. When l got ""Torrid"" l got it partially for the erotica but mostly because the reviews said it was well written but the plot lacked depth and so did the people in it and their relationship. The only reason l gave it two stars rather than one is because at least it was erotic if not well written."
2,Torrid Illusion!,"I had very high hopes for this story, but I was greatly dissapointed. First of all the book is the size of your palm you can fit in your back pocket. The story was pretty fresh, but had many gaps. It felt not like an actual book, but something I'd find in fictionpress six chapters of flat storyline and one dimensional characters. There was no growth within the plot. I was dissapointed and felt as though I'd been ripped off. No one should buy this book for less than five dollars any higher and you're getting ripped."
2,Torrid Left Me Tepid,"I'm all for M/M romances, but perhaps this book's description was misleading. This is a tiny (literally) fictionalized manga novel with one main character (the dance guy) mostly clueless about everything, and the other character (the overbearing guy) totally on fast forward, need-to-mate mode for the main guy. Ms. Hawke has the ability to tell a story, but this was just too absurd for me. I did finish reading it (all 100+ pages) but it definitely is not a keeper."
3,Torrid,"When Kenshin and Trey meet in an adult novelty store, the sparks really fly. Trey is willing to flirt with Kenshin, but it's just a game for him. He's not gay. When they get up close and personal at the bachelor party where Trey is stripping, Trey starts to wonder if maybe he does like guys after all. Kenshin is determined to show Trey that he does like guys and that he's the perfect guy for him.Torrid is the story of two men who decide they like guys as much as they like girls. Trey is a nice enough guy. His submissiveness with Kenshin is fun, but he comes across as a little wimpy, and Kenshin's dominance comes across as bullying rather than sexy. While all in all Torrid is a decent story and Trey and Kenshin find love, it's very story like -- faced paced and a little unrealistic. I'm not sure I like where the story is going, assuming there is more to come as well.NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
3,Playwrights make for good dialogue. Who knew?,"I want to recommend a book I just read, Tony Kushner In Conversation, to those who liked Angels In America or just like reading the spoken thoughts of an eloquent, witty gay playwright. The book was first published about five years ago so some of the references are dated, but that doesn't matter (much) when we're talking about convictions. Which is what a lot of this book is about, being a selection of interviews in which Kushner speaks his mind with sometimes frightening--both to the reader and the playwright, in retrospect--candor."
5,Best Book in the series,This book is the best book in the series. I loved it. This girl named Jane who acts all tough and criticizes a guy named Adam. Who is the captain of the lacrosse team. She reviews Adam every week while he plays his game. Then she writes about him in the school newspaper. It always isn't very positive. But after Jane spends more time with Adam she can't write anything negative about him anymore. She tries to but she just can't. when she finally admits to herself that she likes Adam. She begins to wonder if he feels the same way about her. Now she is scared to tell him. But who will make the first move or will anyone make a move. You have to read the book to see what really happens.
5,Romantic Book that relates to today's world,"""I Do"" is an incredible story about ""Plain"" Jane Olstenhiemer and her fantasys of the name Daisy, a career as a reporter, and NOT being the maid of honor at her cousins wedding. When Lacrosse star, Adam Logan (the biggest jerk at her school in her opinion) becomes the best man, he also, over time, becomes another of Jane's fantasy's. A totally real story that capures your total attention, and makes you sigh with happiness when you finish. I also own, ""At First Sight"" by this author, and I urge you to read both stories. They are really good!"
5,Best of both worlds,"I bought this visor cd holder because I make my own mp3 cds. It holds 10 cds which is fine. But it also allows me to place receipts from gas stations change from tolls and in the clear window pics. It is the best organizer I have found and bought. My old one just held cd's.The only real negative its that it can be hard at times to get at your cd's while driving because they are behind the flap that has the pockets. I have found that it helps if you put the flap behind the visor so it is between the visor and roof, leaving the cd's in clear view. The straps are velcro style which is nice, makes it easy to put on and take off.Not con's but how to improve: if they placed an additional 10 cd pockets behind the pocket flap, though this may make the organizer very large and heavy."
3,Ok but...,"Product is well made and had two layers-one in the front for pens and a clear window and one in the back for CD/DVDs.The size is small and gives up about four inches of potential storage. Also, the Velcro straps are too close together and block the mirror on the visor."
4,Down home fun!,"Twisted- my one word description of the author, Clyde Edgerton. He's a Dave Barry from the deep south. Just when you think you've figured out the plot, he adds a new twist to the story. Did you ever think you'd see a pink tombstone? Or a circular runway? And who would ever think to steal a grave...not the stone, but the spot. Great reading!"
2,Not my style,"The writing style is not to my liking. I find it difficult to make the disjointed phrases and antedotes cohesive, become connected to the characters and still realize a enjoyment of the overall storyline. Having been raised in the south during the 50's and 60's, I recognize some of the characters and situations. Yet overall, I was left wanting.Many may find a greater connection. But, it fails me."
5,Great toy for a little guy!,"I got this toy for my 2-year old nephew who loves Lightning McQueen. He was super excited and started playing with it right away. It's fairly small, but it was the perfect size for him. He has to use two hands to shake it but he loves putting it down and watching it go. I'm not sure how entertaining it would be for an older child, but overall it's the perfect toy for my nephew!"
3,it was okay,thought it would be in better condition than it was but okay....the kid is two so its all good. thanks
1,Not clear to me!,"I have read all the patterns in this book carefully and won't knit any of them, though I might adapt patterns from other books to reflect some of Eaton's design ideas. My main reason for shelving Eaton's book is her reliance on schematics. Schematic drawings illustrate pattern instructions with symbols (not symbolcraft), arrows, lines, and numbers. Eaton does not provide a key of any kind to these drawings, which amazes me given that she assumes her readers need far more basic instruction in things like casting on. Neither Vogue Knitting nor any of my other comprehensive reference books was any help; a search of the Web turned up no instructions. I suppose it would be possible to puzzle the schematics out by carefully comparing the text instructions to the drawings and creating your own key. But I think that was Eaton's job. Frankly, I am now far too irritated by her oversight to reopen the book any time soon."
2,Limited Sizes,"Unfortunately, most pattern are for up to 4T or 6--none big enough. The title implied that they hadlarger sizes."
3,fascinating but...,"Fascinating and intense work, but recorded in such a way that the music drowns out the spoken word. Not that the music isn't interesting, but I needed to hear Mr. Moore better to fully appreciate the piece."
3,Sad Cafe - A confused story,"Let's start with the fact that the cover of this disc comes from the Sad's very first UK album, Fanx Ta-ra. Only three tracks are off that album (the best of all of Sad Cafe's material even today). The three tracks are Black Rose (""first punk rock love song"" per Paul Young at the venue right by Granada Bowl in Manchester circa 1977); I believe (love will survive); and Hungy Eyes. These by far are the best of this collection. It's down hill after that. Honerable mention for Let Love Speak for Itself which was always great live (but watered down on in the studio). Crazy Oyster had no business evening getting out of the studio -- Vic Emerson must have had something on the rest of the band to get that out!"
2,Looks okay but quality is lacking,Thunk the bell with your finger and it sounds tinny. Valve action is poor. Hard to get a good tone. Chinese quality.
3,Extra Card Pack,This is kind of a rip-off. It is a lot of money to spend when all you get is a regular box of cards plus a little pack of the 10 extra cards. The box is not big enough to put all the cards back into it. You should be able to just buy the extra cards for a couple of bucks and just add them to a regular deck
1,500 six person deck of cards?,"This is not a six handed 500 card deck but a standard card deck with a bag of extra cards. Not too happy with this purchase. For the money, and the description, you would think they would come in one box (for storage and safe keeping) but they do not. Hopefully I don't misplace this extra bag of cards. I wish I had two more hands to give this purchase 4 thumbs down. I own around 100 decks of cards. This is the 1st time I have seen them like this. Also no extra joker or instructions as stated in the description. I don't think it'll be worth the money to send this back to the seller."
1,Do not buy!!!,"The main 52 card deck back was GREEN. The 10 ""extra"" cards, packed separately, were BLUE! The normally red hearts and diamonds were green in the 52 card deck. Who would play with these unless you are color blind? Now, to try getting my money back."
2,500 Game playing Cards,There were no instructions or score card included in pack. Very disappointed. I don't think I will purchase playing cards again. Will contact seller if I can to ask for instructions.
2,Six handed 500 Card Deck of cards,I felt these were not worth the price for the way they are packagedI ordered this deck for a gift. They came as one regular deck of 52 cards in a box and then in a seperate plastic bag were the extra cards.No game rules were included for six handed.
5,Wow! I really love this book,"I found this book to be very useful. The introduction story was great, very moving. It would be interesting to see how things turn out for Maria. The whole book was easy to read and gave a lot of useful information. I myself am diabetic and I decided to try out Mr. Watson's suggestions. I would rate this book as one of the top on my list."
3,Good effort but falls a bit short,"Alan Watson has done a commendable job at summing up several controversial issues regarding conventional wisdom and our diet. After having read Gary Taubes' excellent ""Good Calories, Bad Calories"" I guess I was a bit spoiled however since Taubes gives a much more in depth explanation about many of the same topics. I plan on getting Watson's latest offering ""Cereal Killer"" with the hope that it sheds more light on a few of his somewhat controversial (in my mind) pieces of advice."
3,could have been better,i absolutely love otis and i would have loved this cd more if the quality was better. don't get me wrong it's alright but it could have been better.
3,leaking from inside,"the bidet worked well for about 20 days, and now is leaking from inside. I have contacted the seller to see if there is a way to fix the leak."
4,Bio Bidet,"The Bio Bidet is great! In hind sight the bidet was simple to install, however, the instructions are very vague."
5,Good concept,"Excellent product, very practic and easy to install. I recommend to have one in your house. It is white and match perfect with the toilet."
5,Outstanding Customer Service,I'm a mechanical Engineer. The manufacturers of Bio Bidet are one of the best companies I have dealt with both technically and ethically. I posted a negative review earlier regarding certain early mechanical failure that takes place between the valve stem and the valve ball after one year and 3 months of purchasing the unit. I got an instant response from the manufacturer stating that they are willing to replace the valve for free even that the unit is outside warranty. I received the valve in 5 days and they did change the material of the valve stem from plastic to brass. Two thumbs up for customer services. A role model in business ethics and engineering upgrades based on the voice of the customer.
4,"It's OK, but...","Installation went pretty easy - no leaks. I had to position myself well forward to be ""on target"" and discovered that bidets soak most of one's exposed bottom from runoff. Also found that it's best to be 99% clean from paper before using it. The cold water is not a problem and is actually refreshing. Helps reduce irritation as well. Extra paper required to dry off."
2,"It works, but poor quality.","These bidets that fasten under the toilet seat are fantastic. However with this BB-50 the quality leaves something to be desired. First, a chunk out of the crossbar broke out. I tried to fix it with some epoxy putty, but it looks bad. Second, the pressure control handle stop apparently broke off internally, so you just have to be careful when turning the water off that you don't go past the OFF mark or else the water will continue running.I contacted the seller by email, but never got a response. So bottom line is that it does work, but several things broke after the first 2 months. I bought an Elite 2 after this one and it seems to work OK, but the pressure is a bit strong. I will try another brand on future purchases of these."
2,inferior quality stuff,"I purchased and compared with Joy Bidet which I ordered with this assembly. The only tube they provided was plastic one. They did not even provide the teflon tape to prevent leaking. Due to the installation of T piece provided with assembly, you might need to remove the existing pipe from flushing tank to the main water connection. The assembly does not provide the extra pipe to replace the existing pipe that you might have removed. The quality of accessories with unit was really inferior to me. I returned this one and bought another set of Joy Bidet."
1,It leaks,"It worked very well the first couple of days, but then started to leak, it first I realized that the seat moves and as it moves a little it pushes the nozzle to slide out a little, since the nozzle is removable, and leaks so bad outside, after tightening the seat screws, it is still leads, the water pressure pushes the nozzle to slide out a little and still cause a leak."
1,A fine product if you dont mind water on the floor...,"The bidet seemed to work well. But what I thought was just a hose nut leaking, turns out to be inside the valve assembly. I cant return it since its a personal device so I may have to take it apart and try to fix it myself. I admit I went for the low price, but I should have spent more. I do own a GoBidet, all metal unit bought 8 years ago and has worked flawlessly. A little more money so you do get what you pay for."
5,it's AWESOME !!!!,"The variety on this album is refreshing. If you dig rockin' music with a little jazz, blues & contemporary flair, this is the CD for U. And here's a little info. from the info-man.You can get samples of his music on the web at www.lindseyphillips.comlater"
3,"small light but no zoom, low image quality","At first glance I was glad that it is so small that it can fit into my pocket easily. It is light, even with two AA bateries. The appearance is cute. All my friends like the look.But there are some shortcomings. 1. as most digital cameras, it eats batteries. It is OK if you do not take extremely many photos; 2. the memory not compatible to any others; 3. it only has good picture quality under sunshines; 4. if you have extra money, you should go for a camera with some zooming."
5,Super Starter Camera,"The A-200 is a very easy camera to use. Once you put the batteries in set the clock all you have to do is point and shoot.It is very compact. You can take it anywhere. Once your comfortable with the A-200 you can try handling some of the settings yourself, if you want ot try different effects.It's a great camera to use for auction items as well.If you haven't figured it out by now I strongly recommend theFuji A-200."
3,Worth the money,"I sold my five year old Agfa ePhoto camera in order to upgrade and get something with a better zoom, user friendlyness, size & battery life. Here is what I got:This camera is definitely light weight, user friendly & has a great battery life! But, the zoom leaves a lot to be desired. But what could I expect from a [...] purchase?? I looked around all over the net to find a deal and this was it!For the money, this camera is worth every penny. Will recommend to anyone who wants to save money and buy a camera that is hassle-free."
1,it doesn't work,"Hey this is for everyone buying cameras over the world out of the united states, I have a problem with my camera and I don't have anyone to help, I've been trying some help in amazon's help area but they just have thousands of links but any simple email where I can ask for some help, I don't really understand why is this site so well known on ""customer service"", but I just cannot communicate with no one in the company to ask anything, I'm just mad about this, if anyone can help me to contact amazon or fujifilm please post an email or whatever cause there's no such a thing like help in the ""help area"". I need to repair my LCD monitor of my camera, it's really fragile, so if you're still thinking on buying in this site or even buying something from fujifilm, don't do it, they don't care about the customer satisfaction at all."
3,Courtroom drama.,"Lingering Doubt by Warwick Downing is a competently written addition to the courtroom drama genre. It's about a young former gang member who has been framed for capital murder. The story plays out in Long Beach, California and is narrated by Jack Bard, the defense attorney.Bard learns the details of the frame-up from his investigator, Whitney Lee. It occurs to me that the novel would have been far more compelling if it had been told from the point of view of Mr. Lee. That would have afforded the reader the opportunity to observe some interesting detective work in real time instead of merely learning the results after the fact.A very average read deserving of a 3 star rating. No more, no less."
2,.........>_<,"for some sailor moon fans is a disapointment (well for me any way), i 1st strated watching sailor moon on tape, they were all subtitled....they were great! then i heard they it got dubbed! i was happy...but then i watch it...the theme music changed...i was ok...then i watched it and they change a lot! i was so disapointed!i wish dic would of just left it the way it was, don't get me wrong! i really appareant dic for dubbing them....but i wish they would of left it the way it was! END"
4,Sailor moon fan,"Who ever loves to watch sailor moon, than they better buy this cool video with Jupiter and Venus just joining the Sailor Scouts!"
2,Why did they have to change a character's gender?,"I gave this video 2 stars because they changed a character's gender(Zoisite was a male in the original). I can take the music changes and the name changes because that is what they usually change in dubs, but changing a character's gender is too much. I'm not surprised they could pull it off though since he does look feminine and he once disguises himself as Sailor Moon."
3,Not even DiC can wreck this one!,"The episodes where new Sailor Senshi (Scouts) arrive tend to be the more exciting episodes out of the series. DiC has, in my opinion, wrecked this anime in many ways, but every now and then you'll come across some eps where the dubbing wasn't TOO terrible, and these two are good examples. If you're a dub fan that missed these eps on t.v., I strongly suggest picking up this lil gem. ^_^ END"
2,Not much for not much,"WHile this disc doesn't cost much, you don't get that much. Video quality is OK, but Blu-Ray deserves better. I bought this item because I was eager to get some high quality material to show off my Blu-Ray system. Unfortunately this is not it! Probably will never watch it through. Ah well!"
2,HD Window: The Great Southwest (Blu-ray),"Technically, the visuals and audio are excellent. Content, however, is a disappointment. It is a collection of stills advancing much too slowly. Many, many attractive sites in the Southwest are simply not included."
2,"content so so, picture clear","I got this HD DVD, the picture is clear due to HD DVD, but the content is not what I expect. Moving picture is not ""moving"", the camera just stayed in one place and did not move when taking moving picture. I do not like this style."
2,It's it literally like looking out a window...,"Ok, talk about truth in advertising...this is literally like a window on the landscape. Other dvd's of this type that I have owned featured movement and/or time lapse photography to make it both visually interesting and still convey some type of ""action"". This DVD put me to sleep. It's like a slide show of vacation photographs. It that's what you want, fine, but in my mind, there other better choices out there to bring back memories of trips to region. They must have taken a camera, mounted it on a tripod, stuck it up in places and shot a few minutes of film and moved on. I gave it two stars because it is beautiful, but not for me."
3,Good,Video pictures are good by the music is real anoying and sometime they stay on a scene too long
2,This book makes us look bad.,"I'm an EMT in one of the top rated systems in the world. This book, is not the best I've read. Although Pat and Ed are outstanding EMT's, they make the job sound like you just drive there, get on-scene and be a cowboy. I disagree with the reputation they give all public safety personnel."
5,Realistic story of a volunteer Emergency Medical Technician,"Pat Ivey writes of her stories as a volunteer on a ruralambulance squad. Her tales reflect not only the adventure,but the compassion of those who choose to give of themselves to help others. While reading this book I was reminded of many ambulance runs I have been on and patients I've treated. She also makes you feel the intangibles, the small details of caring and service to others that keep me and so many others volunteering as EMT's."
1,Do Not Buy,This is just an unbelievable price for this part! Amazon should not be selling car parts if this is the prices they are trying to charge!! The price for this part in any part store is just under $200. I thought Amazon was meant for getting a better deal not for highway robbery. I shop amazon all the time and this is just out of line!!!
1,Horrible,"Well for the price, you definately get what you pay for. They don't work at all. Please don't waste your time and money with these. You're much better off spending $50 on the true Canon brand battery."
3,"Not Cannon batteries, but will do the job.","I was expecting to get batteries made by Canon, but I got these aftermarket ones instead. For the price, you really can't beat them though. I had an old Canon 20 D that I wasn't able to use as frequently with the 2 batteries I had from Canon because they were starting to loose their charge after several years of professional use, but since I bought these after market replacements, the 20 D is up and running again."
1,does not hold charge,I have had this battery for about 3 years now. The first month or two the battery worked fine. It held charge and seemed to be performing normally. The performance of the battery drastically diminishes over time to the point where it can handle about 5-10 photos on the 20D now. It is effectively useless. My originally Canon battery (10 years old) is out performing this by leaps and bounds. There are better alternatives out there. Keep looking.
3,Fret Stamp,"The product did meet my expectations, but was much bigger than I thought. I was able to use it to show fret and finger placements which helps me to play my ukuleke."
2,Prada Schmada,I'm not convinced this is the real thing even though I paid as if it were a real Prada bag. It isn't very functional and the zipper for the main compartment is so small that I can barely get my hand inside. This makes pulling something out in addition to your hand a challenge. I shouldn't of spent the money. I gave it two stars because it arrived quickly and I still have it in my closet.
2,Very dissapointed...,"As someone who used to read Max Lucado a lot (about 10 yrs ago), I remembered the basis of this story very fondly. I must not have read the product description very well, because the 'movie' is about than 45 mins long. The acting is about the average for a 'christian' production. I wish I hadn't spent the $11 on it because I enjoyed reading the short story FAR more."
3,"Good, but not- Images and Words","This CD, although better than most of today's rock, isn't the masterpiece that their previous release ""Images and Words"" was. This is more of a simple modern metal CD that lacked the artism of their prevous release. They try to sound harder, however it doesn't come off that way. Still a good release for today's prog. rock listeners."
5,Great Dream Theater,This is a great album i cant find enough info on dream theater and this is the only album i have but ive listened to it 3 times in 1 day before and i never get tired of it.
1,"Oh, don't do it!","This album is horrible. Just horrible.I suppose it depends on what kind of 'Metal' you're looking for. If you want a return of Queensryche in some form then this album will suit you. But, if you are out for something really heavy and powerful go find something else. Like Opeth's Blackwater Park.Don't buy this album. It is not a masterpiece like others have stated. It is a dreadfully bad compilation."
1,SHUT UP JAMES!,"Someone burned this disk for me along with Rush's VAPOR TRAILS, and I thought VAPOR TRAILS was descent but this album is a piece of genuine CRAP! Jame LaBrie is a horrid singer that just screams his damn head off, and all the songs are quite lengthly and (yawn) boring. The only thing that gets this album even 1 star is Mike Portnoy's awsome drumming (I'm a drummer, you see)! If you want good drumming AND good music, here are the groups I'd recommend:Rush (Neil Peart)The Mars Volta (Jon Theodore)AND OF COURSE...Led Zepplin (John Bonham)"
3,Who is Adem that wrote the Amazon Review for this?,"I can't believe that I have ever seen a rant about prog rock, instead of a review for CD before. Who the heck is this Adem dude anyway? ""Rock is supposed to be mindless"". Well that is nice to know, now that I have listened to decades of great music with great lyrics by many, many bands that so many other people think are wonderful.By the way, this is an excellent recording. Don't always pay attention to all of the reviews by the Amazon personnel!"
3,They listened to too much FM radio in the '80s,"Musicianship is fantastic, riffs and vocals are trapped in the past & sound tired."
5,Wide awake indeed,"Possibly their second-best album, after the ""Scenes from a memory"" tour de force. Musically both kaleidoscopic (from frenetic odd-meter beats to the almost meditative ""Space dye vest"") and adventurous. Favorite songs: 6:00 (whew!), Erotomania (a virtuosic instrumental which quotes rhapsodically from much of their work), and -- at the other extreme musically --- the haunting ""Space-Dye vest"". The lyrics are perhaps the band's weakest point --- but there's so much delicious instrumental stuff going on that you hardly notice the lyrics, and relate to the singer as the fifth instrumentalist. Unapologetically theatrical, but with the musical chops to back it up. These guys are not just very much masters of their respective instruments, but also mesh into each other like gears. Wide awake indeed!"
5,Dream Theater is one of my favorite bands.,I love Erotomania. This is an excellent album. I recommend it to any Dream Theater fans.
2,SHM imports are terrible!!!,"First, I LOVE DREAM THEATER. They are my favorite band. Second, I am not reviewing this Dream Theater album as much as I am commenting on the SHM import version from Japan. I have this fetish for remasterings and figure 'people will do better than the original' - so I coughed up the money for this Japanese SHM-CD (and others as to save on shipping). It appears that all they did was to increase the levels on the whole album! Also, this has created a terrible boomy lower midrange while the originals have a tight and punchy sound.I have an audiophile system and can tell you that there is no improvement on the originals. In fact, the originals are textured and nuanced compared to these terrible SHM monstrosities. Save your money and get the domestic releases - they are perfect!!!"
4,Hold on to your heart,"This album took a while to grow on me because of its morose and dark textures. I was looking for a band that sounded like Images and Words, but that isn't necessarily the case here. This is an emotional roller coaster ride provided by the heart-wretching tales of breakup and dispair. The 3-part Erotomania-Voices-Silent Man and Lie are strong musically and lyrically and is about the heaviest this CD gets. Lifting Shadows Off a Dream lightens the mood but not by much. I have to agree with other reviewers that Space-Dye Vest is not for people with weak constitutions or those going through emotional times as it will pull at your heart. It is one of the most emotional (and depressing) songs I have ever heard. Awake is the last DT album with keyboardist, Kevin Moore. This CD is a must have for DT fans, but since it is such a dark album, it is hard to give a strong recommendation otherwise."
5,DT's best!,"This album took a while to grow on me. The first time I heard I nodded and thought it was good, not as good as Scenes From a Memory but good none the less. Well after having it for a while I changed my mind. This was sadly the last album Kevin Moore made while a member of Dream Theater, therefore this is the last album with truly great key's (ya Scenes was good but not up to this) and I think Moore was their best lyricist. This is a great mood album; it ranges to heavy and angry to soft and beautiful, A great range of sound with DT's amazing speed and technical ability souring with emotion. LaBrie's vox are some of his best putting everything he has into each song. Plus it's a long over 70 min so you get your moneys worth. Over all a great album!"
3,Okay Dream Theater has talent but..,"To all the people who like Prog. Rock.-- Just because music is different doesn't mean its good. I'm not saying that all different and prog. bands suck-- I love bands such as Primus and many songs from Genesis and Yes. It's just when i listen to a CD like Awake, i get bored. Many of the songs are 6 minutes+. Many of the parts in the songs sound like they belong in a disney movie, such as some parts in Voices. They have talent, but they should produce more shorter songs to keep more people (yes i know that have many fans, but people like me) interested."
2,WHAT HAPPENED ?,"As a relative newcomer to D.T. (having only heard SFAM and IMAGES AND WORDS), my expectations were high prior to purchasing this one. I have to say what A DISAPPOINTMENT !!! Where are the catchy hooks and good songs that filled ""Images"" .It sounds like they were just putting this out to satisfy a contract. These guys are great musicians (especially Portnoy and Petrucci),but this disc lacks good songs and good production. It just sounds like a typical 90's band trying to be heavy, but with no substance.In fact they never really got it back together until SFAM. Buy ""Images"" and ""SFAM"" , avoid everything else (except maybe ""Six Degrees""). If you really want to hear these guys (most of them)play with substance and style get either of the ""Liquid Tension Experiment"" discs. Those are hands-down superior to this one."
2,Where is the melody ?,"Tempo changes are a mean to reach an overall atmosphere not a goal in itself. This really dont hit anything in terms of catch,speed or energy....."
4,?,Have used this product for a number of years but all of a sudden I could not find this product in my area. Found it through Amazon and ordered it.
4,Stretch mark free,"My mom and sister are both covered in stretch marks so I just kind of accepted that I would get them too. I wasn't going to use anything but I figured I would regret not trying anything so I ordered this oil. I applied it every morning and night and I am stretch mark free (currently 5 months post)! I watched what I ate, gaining the recommended 30lbs which may have had something to do with it but if I get pregnant again I'll be buying this again.I only gave it 4 stars because of the price. I probably spent $200 on this stuff but like I said earlier, I would do it again."
5,GOOD SERIES,"LOVE THIS SERIES. I HAD SEEN IT ONCE BEFORE, BUT AM COLLECTING THE BOXED SETS SO MY SISTER CAN ENJOY TOO"
4,Nip/Tuck Season 4,"Being a total fan of this series I watched the entire season in a weekend. The show takes on a new level and loved Christian's story line. Was left wanting more in Season 5 and was intrigued with Brooke Shields character, but she seemed to just dropped out of the series, although I expect her to return. Fans will love this season"
5,AWESOME!!!!,WOW I am a die hard nip tuck fan and i have every season on DVD and this was just the best addition to my collection... there were some pretty interesting episodes but holy cow this show gets more twisted with every episode! I cant wait for season 5 to begin!!! California all the way baby!
1,"item no good, never recieved it",still waiting for my product never recieved it dont know if it was something wrong with the shipper or the company carring the video
1,Poor Quality,Fast shipping and very cheap price; after I received the dvds I understand why they were so cheap...because they don't work!!! I tried playing them in two different dvd players; wouldn't work in either one!!
2,"Great Show, Bad Visuals","Great show, bad visuals. Sounds is very clear and crisp.The reason my rating is low is because the visuals look a bit grainy on my Philips 37"" HDTV which is 1080i. Perhaps my settings are not set properly, but the show is great. The visuals are kinda painful to watch compared to some movies I have seen, i.e. Reign Over Me, which looks spectacular.Safe shopping"
4,"Came defected, then replaced pretty fast","The item cam defected - one of the discs was missing. Wrote an email describing the problem, was advised to send back the item at no cost, got a brand new one even before they received the old one. Overall, satisfied with the service - fast & furious"
3,Getting a bit outlandish...,"I have been a rabid fan since the very first episode, but this season... It's becoming more & more like a daytime soap...Sean becomes an alcoholic, but cleans up in the same episode? Scientology? Kimber & Matt? Come on...I will continue to watch, hoping they will get back to the original cutting edge stuff they used to do, ascerbic humor, hot sex scenes, instead of all this wallowing in middle-aged pity stuff. I can get that at home..."
3,Tamer this season?,"i am a HUGE Nip/Tuck fan, ranking this programme my favorite, and i had waited very eagerly for the arrival of season 4.As usual, the script writers are creative and the story lines push all the envelopes (which is what i liked about Nip/Tuck to begin with; nothing sacred, very bold and daring) but i'm not sure why it just didn't grab me this season like it did the first 3 Seasons. i can't explain why; maybe they tried too hard this time, maybe the casts just didn't have the same chemistry it did. 3 Stars awarded for effort. Brooke Shields still looks fabulous and Jacqueline Bisset played the baddie to the T."
3,Not as good as previous seasons,"The first three seasons were much better. I cannot put my finger on any particular thing, but is just wasn't up to par."
4,Yet another exciting drama!!,"Like all the other seasons, Nip/Tuck season 4 has the same thrilling drama, comedy and spine-tingling operations. The storyline is great and keeps you watching episode after episode to see what happens next!"
3,4th season not so great,I agree with other reviews here. I think the writers ran out of ideas. Season 4 definitely not up to par with the first 3 seasons.
3,Enjoyable,I have enjoyed watching this series as it has been very suspenseful and fun. This season was rather slow and kind of boring. Just ordered season 5 so hopefully alot better.
3,"A Good Season, But Lacking In the Greatness of the Previous Ones","Nip/Tuck is still rather crazy and many things are always happening to these characters season to season.This time we deal with the controversial topics of disabled children (before they are born) with Julian and Sean, Christian's new relationship with they new boss, Michelle, and her own murky past.The drama seems forced and after the carver, the new ""kidney stealer"" thing sort of seems to pale in comparison. However, Julia and Sean and the situation with their baby is pretty heartfelt; they did a good job with this. Julia's later relationship with her Nanny, not as appealing, especially after all this couple has gone through. Sean is no exception to having an affair though. Quick to judge rather than also be what he is criticizing.Many of the characters kind of made me angry at their stupidity this season, but it does have its good points."
5,Thank you,"Sorry this is sooo late. Sadly I just found this email, life can be a bit hectic. I really appreciate this it was a gift for my son in Iraq."
4,great series,"Im addicted to this show, have every season so far, but this is the first blu ray season to have. I have only watched the first episode, and its hard to compare to the normal dvd without having something to compare to, but its a good picture. Im using my PS3 to play it, so I know there are better blu ray players out there.Only problem with shipping was that one of the discs inside was loose and sliding around. I don't think it damaged it though, hopefully not."
4,STILL LOVE NIP/TUCK,"I THOUGHT THIS SEASON WAS GOOD. IT JUMPED AROUND AT TIMES AND LEFT US HANGING ON SOME ISSUES, BUT OTHER THAN THAT I LIKED IT. I THOUGHT THE MICHELLE CHARACTER WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR CHRISTIAN IF HE WAS REALLY READY TO SETTLE DOWN. THEY BOTH HAVE SKELETONS IN THEIR CLOSET. THE ISSUE OF COLOR MADE NO DIFFERENCE. I THOUGHT JULIAN AND SANAA HAD GREAT CHEMISTRY. THIS CHARACTER WAS THE ONLY ONE BESIDES KIMBER THAT HE HAD A CONNECTION WITH AND ACTUALLY HAD MEANINGFUL SEX WITH.. I ALSO THOUGHT THE WRITING OF THE DISRESPECT THAT HE SHOWED TOWARD KIMBER WAS NOT NECESSARY. POOR SEAN JUST COULDN'T CATCH A BREAK. I WAS SAD TO SEE JULIA GO. I KNOW SHE'LL BE BACK. THIS SEASON WILL DEFINITLY MAKE MY COLLECTION. CHRISTIAN IS HOT!!! AS USUAL. HE MAKES UP FOR WHAT IT LACKS AT TIMES."
2,Right Price Wrong Format,I thought I got a deal until I got my DVD. It was a HD DVD! I guess I'll have to buy a new DVD player to play it. Overall the price was nice...
3,need better packaging,"appreciate receiving this item, but at what point will shippers stop putting DVD's in padded envelopes, such that they arrive with the case crushed? I am reluctant to send this back, as I know HD DVD's are becoming increasingly scarce, and I want the series. Please - use a box or at least a cardboard flat pack."
4,Great serie,"Mi wife love this siries, for me is a little rape, but most of the people love it because show the real life of most of the plastic surgeon."
5,Best show ever,"Other than Sopranos, Nip/Tuck is the best show on TV. I strongly suggest buying all the seasons and watching them if you haven't seen them. It kind of makes me wish I went to medical school to become a plastic surgeon."
4,What About The Music,I really think the music always makes the scene but what bothers me is that they have great music that I hear for the first time and they never put the artist or song in the credits. Like in the season finale I heard at least 3 songs I liked but dont know who the artist is. Where can I get that information?
2,"Wow, what happened?","For some reason, I never watched this show on television, this summer I've gotten the box sets and played catch upSeason 1 and 2 were great, 3 was tedious, but I still had hope for the 4th.What in the world happened? The storylines in this season were so weak, you could drive a Mack truck through the holes!! I found myself wishing episodes would be over and looking at the clock, something I never did before.I haven't seen season 5, here's hoping it can improve"
2,Not Bad,"Empieza entretenida y muy controversial como siempre, sin embargo me parece que despuÃ©s de la mitad de la temporada se les agotan los temas y quieren darle muchas vueltas y resucitar personajes anteriores. Al final hacen un musical horrible, demasiado cursi e introducen la siguiente temporada Macnamara/Troy en los Angeles. Si no retoman la cretividad serÃ¡ muy dificil que mantengan a sus fans."
4,Out of the recovery room and into season 4,"Season 3 was dreadful and season 4 was.....Great!I was so happy that my show was back after the lows of season 3. The most evident change is the return of humor and action that made 1&2 so fun to watch. I will admit that the show has gone kind of ""Alley Mcbeal""(descending into preposterous unbelievable territory.)But they have to keep the story development going and thats tough considering the situations the characters have already been through.I doubt Nip Tuck will ever shock us again like season one did but season 4 is a great watch even for the initiated."
5,Nip/Tuck,"Great picture detail, sorry that HD DVD went away, I also have blu-ray. Would have loved to see the compition continue and bring the price of HD movies down."
3,Nip Tuck Season four,"Although the package was sealed, one of the discs had some problems and would not play properly. I was disappointed."
2,"Beautiful Pictures, But Weak Text","Any book containing attractive reproductions of Maxfield Parrish's work is bound to be visually stunning. But the text is loaded with partially informed speculation about the relationship between Parrish and Sue Lewin, his favorite model. The author is an art dealer, not a historian, and her lack of analytical training is a serious problem. Maybe Lewin was Parrish's lover. But where's the concrete evidence? Everything that the author presents to support her contentions is either hearsay or capable of more than one interpretion. The fact that they shared a house for several decades is a VERY persuasive fact, but Gilbert damages her credibility -- and her case -- by tossing in too much pointless guessing."
2,Trite poorly written nonsense that has nothing to say about Parrish's art.,"I was so tempted to give one star and probably would have if the author didn't stop when she did.The book has nothing of importance to say, no insights and only the author's opinions with very little to back it up.If tempted to purchase a book about the art of Parrish, avoid this one as it will disappoint.Perhaps the photo of the author in a sleeveless black frock and elbow length gloves was warning enough of the calibre of this insipid book.It is so bad, I wouldn't lend it or give it away. No one deserves to be punished by it."
5,Legendary,"This is a wonderful account of Scherezade. Magnificent performancethat could stay in the top 3 greatest recordings, besides Beecham andMarkevitch. This is an accurate recommendation."
4,"Good, but not comprehensive","In my opinion average user of MATLAB very soon goes beyond of the scope of this book. So it is quite usefool, but not for the long time."
1,No.,"This video is way too easy, and also rather boring. The instructor doesn't safely move from one pose to another, nor does she instruct on correct posture for poses. This would not be a good thing for someone not already familiar with yoga, so if you are a beginner, don't buy this one.Sadly, I bought the dvd for $10 and I'll be lucky if I can re-sell it for a buck. Pass."
1,A definite NOT!,"I am sure Suzanne Deason is a perfectly nice person but man, oh man, does she suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck as a yoga instructor!I bought this DVD by mistake and now cannot return it.Seriously, if you're looking for a great beginner yoga DVD, save your money and get The Firm's power yoga (and don't let the title fool you, as it's really 15 minutes of yoga poses that flow nicely and logically and 15 minutes of stretching, yet you WILL get in shape!).Deason's way of teaching is counter intuitive for the beginner, she does not explain anything in depth, which is hugely important when doing yoga, and the camera angles are so random and illogical that you constantly have to crane your neck to see what she is doing!That was 15 bucks and 30 minutes I will never get back.Learn vicariously!Hope this helps poor unsuspecting souls....Namaste!"
2,Little disappointed,"I was disappointed in this video. Suzanne Deason is one of my favorite instructors, usually during her workouts I am challenged, without being overly so. This video is really only ok for people who want a very light workout. Maybe when you're tired, have a minor injury, or just want a little energy boost. But, if you're serious about weightloss, this light workout won't offer much to help you toward your goal."
1,Not for weight loss!!,This video is slow and I wouldn't use it for anything but relaxation. It nearly put me to sleep. I can do both workouts and don't feel a thing other than relaxed. I was very disappointed with the quality. The talk about menstral cycles and the aim to talk to women only is disconcerting too. I think they forgot what their video was supposed to be aimed at- weight loss. Wish I could return it!
2,Should be correctly labeled,"I agree with the other reviews. This is only AM yoga, and that's what it should be titled or more like ""Yoga for Beginners"". It seems incomplete and inadequate, and I would actually think that even beginners wouldn't take away much from this DVD. It's more like a light workout. There's plenty of other DVDs that are far more helpful. Pass on this."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"I presume this is supposed to be a young adult type novel. For that, I think I would recommend it. A girl, a space station, cat smuggling, all that sort of thing. Not weighed against everything else in general though."
4,Don't be fooled by the cover,"There is something wrong with the cover listed for this book. THose are NOT WWII uniforms and the drawings look to be by Ron Volstad. However, if you click on the image, it reveals a different but correct book cover of WWII US Army uniforms drawn by Mike Chappell."
3,Repetitive Consultant Jargon Clouds Good Message,"The authors make a strong case for balancing the impact of day to day business decisions on current cash flows from customers against future possible cash flows from a customer. They even provide some insights into how a business owner/manager could improve the balance of his/her decisions.Unfortunately, their writing style is filled with repetitive consultant speak. Each chapter begins with two or three paragraphs of the same message. The authors then reiterate the message with pointless rhetorical questions throughout. Readers will need to cull through this jargon to find the truly useful material."
4,A book for Christians that want to be thinking disciples,"Sweet wrote this book to help those of us that are Christ's followers (aka disciples) that what to think about what on earth we are doing. This is not to say that this is a book that requires a PhD in Theology to understand. It is a book that you don't just pick up, do a quick read, and say ""well that we nice"". It is a book that you read, and say ""so how does that effect how I do life right now???"""
1,Waist of Time,Last edited by you 15 minutes agoE. McManus says:I think: This book is a complete waist of time and money. The price of $.95 is a statement of it's value. Every page is work to read and understand. The content is all over the place like ADHD had a hand in this. The book contains 36 pages of references and index at the end and was most probably put there to document unconnected ideas and to take up space. If you are trying to understand more about Christianity and our relationship with God - THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO FIND IT! We read this book as a sundy school project and chose to abandon it as a bad idea. I don't normally go off on things like this. (Bad ideas get thrown in the trash) But this is so extreem I just had to.
5,Great music for all seasons at a great price,"As is also true of all the other CDs in this ""Greatest Hits"" series, the selections, performance, sound quality, and durability are outstanding, a great value for the price. I also highly recommend the Scotch Disc Cleaner for CD and DVD at a fair price of only $12.59."
4,An excellent review of North American mammals,"This book is a fine review of the many families of North Anerican mammals and of their individual members. From shrews to whales and from opossums to man, this book is encyclopedic in sweep, yet easily grasped by all readers. The photography in many instances is esceptional. and the descriptions and discusssion are scientifically impeccable. Good descriptions on habitat, diet, bahavioral traits, and much more are included. The book includes a unique section on exotic mammals brought here by the hand of man.I highly recommend this book to both the interested layman and the professional. It is a valuable addition to any outdoorsman's library and excellent for children as well. An exemplary effort, National Geographic!!"
2,A Turandot past her prime,"While Ben Heppner makes an excellent Calaf, the Turandot of Eva Marton is disappointing. She cares more about decibels than anything and is well past her prime. The orchestral playing is average."
1,this role belongs to Sutherland and Nilsson,"If you like shouting and sceaming, then Marton is your choice. But if you like beautiful singing, Nilsson and Sutherland is your choice, ok?"
5,Brilliant,"The understatement and distance that Seth places between the lives of the 'two live' (aunt and uncle) is the strength of this book. It technically is a story of 3 people as Vikram Seth as narrator begins the journey of putting together the biographies of 2 uncovenetional people who live through a bleak period is histroy and whose lives are touched by history. As ordinary folks the tales are not widely known and it is this usage of understatement that propmts the reader to stay with the story. Indian male, qaulified as a German dentist and then loses an arm fighting in Monte Cassino. Meets old German friend and works to keep up the old college days friendship from Germany - despite her own tragedy. So this book opens pages in history that one knows in broad terms and seeps and draws you in as a witness. he does rescue them from being a mere history lesson as he as Vikram is along side with us in the book. Different genre for Vikram Seth and a novel that has to be made into a movie."
2,Poor viewing qualigy,"I was lead to believe that this product ws more along the lines of the blaxplointation genre of films of which I am a huge fan. I have currently watched one film that did start Richard ""Shaft"" Roundtree named Embassy. The movie was just okay, but the veiwing quality was quite poor. It was grainy and also hard to hear. i would not recommend this product."
4,Memorex CD-R,I found these cd's to be very good quality at a good price. No problems. I plan on purchasing more in the near future for photo backups on all my computers.
2,Make sure to test your CDs - high failure rate,"I spent a lot of time recently backing up digital photos on CDs and got frustrated enough with this brand that I feel the need to warn folks about it. They seem to produce a large number of duds that won't play/open after you burn them. Some won't even burn in the first place, others will pretend to have burned just fine but won't open with any drive I've tried. Make sure you test your backup CDs to verify that your computer can read them before erasing the data from your computer! From the package I had bought, I ended up throwing away 15% of the CDs after burning and finding out they didn't work. Had I not tested them before deleting files, I would have lost a lot of photos I thought I had just backed up. Bought another brand (HP) and went through almost 50 CDs so far and have not had to throw a single one away yet."
1,They simply don't work -- multiple burners tried,I've tried burning data onto these from my HP 1040 burner and the UJ-852 burner in my laptop. My kids also have a high failure rate on these with their Macbook burners. They're just junk. Stay away from them. (I have good luck generally with Verbatim disks.)
1,Doesn't work with MacG4,"After 3 attempts, this would not record pictures in jpg format onto my Macintosh Quicksilver G4. What a waste of money.Verbatim's CD-R (74MIN/650MB), however does work!"
4,"At $17.99, You'd Be A Fool Not To Get These","The Memorex 700MB/80-Minute CD-R has always been a favorite of mine. I've been through lots of different writers and all of them were compatible with this brand. In fact, I've been using Memorex for about 4 years now and I've yet to come across any problems. Whether you're making music CDs, backing up files, or just saving pictures, Memorex is probably your best bet. And if you buy two spindles on Amazon, you'll get free shipping. It's pretty much a no brainer. If there's a better brand out there, I haven't seen it yet."
5,Item was exactly as described,"Item was exactly as described, quick ship, smooth transaction. Would love to business with again! Thanks"
1,Bad experience,"My exerience with these discs hasn't been good. They skip on my CD player, and my DVD player won't recognize them (neither will my portable CD player which I use in the car). The only place they work is on my PC at home and at work. I haven't had that problem with other brands. I had the same trouble with a box of Memorex CD-RW (which I bought at a different place). Actually, in that case, I two CDs out of 10 in the box weren't defective. Glad to hear others haven't been so unlucky."
3,Shipping could be better,"I ordered lots of blank media in the past, but this was the first for me from amazon. The media it self is fine, except the packaging could be better. Upon receiving the item the spindle was in a box with that is clearly to big, in the box were those clear plastic balloon it was not wrap around the spindle. So to me the clear plastic balloon has to use for the media rolling around the box. So upon opening the media 2 of the dvd was crack and the case cover was crack also. I did not call amazon, because for only 2 broken dvd it was not worth the time. So next time when you order anything fragile, call them to make sure it was shipped properly. Otherwise you will go thru the hassle of returning and waiting longer for your item."
3,"Lots of CDs, good price.","Well, they are CDs... So far they have worked without burn errors. I'd like a better labeling system, but they work well. No complaints."
1,A Lot of Defective Disks,"Memorex doesn't stand by their products. They don't care if these work or not. Approximately 40% of the disks failed. I contacted Memorex and at first they seemed concerned that their disks would not work, but after a couple of e-mails back and forth, I never heard from them again. They would not give a refund or replace the defective disks."
1,Don't buy 100-pack bundle CDs,"If you want to buy larger than 50-pack bundle cds, you'd better buy it at retail stores such as Best Buy or Office Depot. I bought it on Amazon, I was really angry because the CD rack which is a black bar at the center of the packing was totally broken during the delivery. Although it's little bit heavy item, the sender just put it in the box without any cushion. When I open it, the broken particles were rolling around the CDs. As you know, they might make CDs worst condition. I didn't return it because it definitely takes long time to change it. the CDs don't have any problems so far. However, I never buy bundle cds here."
1,Mac Owners beware,"I cannot speak for Intel-based Macs, but these CD-Rs have given me problems on all my PowerPC based machines. My (beige w/ external burner) G3 refused to write them at all. My G4 (Quicksilver) did write them, but several times when I went to retrieve data from a Memorex CD-R, it was damaged. My G5 handles them fine, but the drive makes a horrid scratching noise that it doesn't with, for example, Maxell CD-Rs. Also, I was burning them in Joliet format for use on a PC, which may make a difference.When I called Memorex about my original issue, they told me my drive (the G3 external) didn't 'like' their CD-Rs, and that was that. Tough for me, eh? I will say they seem to work fine in PCs, and it may be some problem with Pioneer burners (both the G4 and G5 have these). All the same, I'd get a smaller package before I hauled off and bought a hundred of these if I owned a Mac, and especially a PowerPC based one."
3,Scary,"I never purchased this brand of CD-R, but did purchase some images recorded on one. The person who recorded it, put an adhesive backed paper label on the non data surface, to ID the disc. When I noticed the CD seemed to have a defect (couldn't read contents), I then noticed a blemish on the data (recorded) side. When I went to remove the label, directly over the blemish, the entire data (and layers) easily peeled off! May have been a bad batch, but, still, I don't recommend using ANY adhesive-paper label to identify the contents of a CD-R."
2,May contain scratched CDs,"I've purchased Memorex CDs by mail through this site several times, and will continue to do so since they don't go on sale very often in my area anymore. Twice so far the CD cake boxes were broken upon receipt. In the first instance the CDs themselves were fine. In my March 7th purchase the cake box was damaged enough that I had to transfer the CDs to a different cake box, and found that several CDs--five so far of the hundred--were scratched and unusable. The CDs themselves are reliable when not damaged, and they are shipped quickly but definitely need to be packaged more securely.UPDATE: 34 OF THE 100 CDS WERE SCRATCHED OR OTHERWISE MARKED. I LOOKED INTO ASKING FOR A PARTIAL REFUND BUT FOUND IT IS EITHER ALL OR NOTHING, SO I AM OUT OF LUCK. I HAD TO USE THE CDS THAT WERE UNMARKED--I PURCHASED THEM FOR ARCHIVAL REASONS, AND NEEDED THEM WHEN I PURCHASED THEM. I GUESS IF YOU CAN, BUY YOUR CDS IN PERSON?"
1,Memorex 700MB CD-R blank CDs for copying,"These CDs are the worst performing CDs that I have ever bought! After encountering problems on almost all the two 100 packs that I bought, I did some research on what a quality CD would be. It was decided that Sony was the only CD that we could depend on for copying audio to CD-R. Other name brands that have better quality cost way more but Sony is the best for the mid to low grade discs that we must have. With the last order I switched to Sony and have had no problems at all. I do not know if Memorex checks their quality but Maxel discs have perform okay but Sony is the best in the price range that we can afford.Amazon, most of the 100 pack CDs arrived with the case broken. You may want to check your packaging to be sure that they are protected. Otherwise, your service is okay."
1,"Do not buy, high failure rates","We purchased 500 for your Help-Portrait event this year and these disks have been a nightmare. The failure rate is easily over 50% and this is amoung 15 photographers burning disk at their own computers. Not only was the packaging poor from Amazon, the disks themselves have been a true failure. Save yourself the time and money and buy another product that works. It was also painful to find out how poor these disks were after putting labels on each one."
1,dissatisfied,"I bought a 30 pack of these. Five of them worked. The other 25 did not. I tried every single one! ... Don't waste your money. I also have older ones that are starting to delaminate also. It's not worth it. Bottom line: pay a couple of dollars more, and get a quality product if you value your music at all."
1,Shockingly poor quality,"I'm amazed that a company as large and well-known as Memorex would sell something so awful. At least one out of three discs fails. I've stepped down recording speed to the minimum - 8x - and enabled verify but still end up with useless discs. Never again, Memorex."
1,Recent Problems,"I have used several of these spindles without any problems. The last spindle, however, had dirt particles inside the spindle's factory packaging, and every other disc was damaged - they would not burn with any burner or software I tried."
1,Prodisc,"I would surely never buy anything by Memorex, Imation, Verbatim, Sony, or TDK, because they're disloyal.The ATIP on all of those brands are either Prodisc, RiTEK, Sony Corp. AKA Lead Data and CMC Magnetics, which are all the worst factories in the world.Do not buy this product, they cannot write 48x, and the pthalocyanine dye is terrible.Look for FujiFilm, they are all Taiyo Yuden manufactured, and I consider Taiyo Yuden to be the #1 manufacturer.Maxell 50 pack ""audio"" CD-R's are also Taiyo Yuden, they're the same thing except a different pre-groove telling a stand-alone burner it's an audio CD-RI repeat, DO NOT, BUY, THIS, PRODUCTIt's a waste of money for a piece of ..."
3,Some disks are corrupted,"The ones that are good work well. Many of them are rejected, saying they are corrupted. My last 100ct cake of these were all good. Not sure what the problem was... maybe something I did? But I had to throw quite a few of them away right off the spindle."
1,Too many duds,I purchased 2- 100 blank CD bundles and each of them have about 30% unwritable disks.Not worth the money or the waste in time trying to copy onto these CDs.
3,Some CD's were unuseable due to scrathes or warped,Out of the 100 CD's about 17 of them were unuseable due to scratches or warped so recording skippped when played after recording to these disks.
1,Did nor foresee these problems,After burning on the first 20 cds: I realised around 50% lasted less than 2 playings before starting skipping
1,"Unusable disks, do not waste your money","Wow, I'm just amazed at how lousy theses disks are. I've been burning for years (since '97) and this is the first time I've ever encountered unburnable disks.I purchased a spindle of the Memorex 52x 700 mb disks and have tried to burn 'em on numerous different burners/computers.No luck the disks just don't burn.Wish me luck on returning this garbage."
1,"First review and had to be a negative one, SORRY","I dont write reviews, well this is my first one....well I bought tthis Memorex 80 Minute/700 MB 52X CD-R Discs (100-Pack Spindle), in January and I was so happy because i thought it was a great deal.... but I WAS WRONG, I dont burn cds daily, so the time passed, and I noticed that when I was burning any king of data in this cd-rs I noticed that they had file errors... so far I have thrown away like 20 cd-rs because they are not good backup copies, I have like 60 blank cd-rs and Im gonna throw them away....THE WORST THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT I CANT GET MY MONEY BACK.Thank you"
2,Very Cheap Quality Media,"Now I know why these discs are so inexpensive. You get what you pay for. My Toshiba and Plextor burners can handle 16x and 40x burn speeds but anything over 2x with these discs will fail at about the 20% mark. When attempting to burn at speeds over 4x, these discs cause both my burners to vibrate loudly before failing. Maybe I just got a bad batch but the discs are very flimsy and the wavy imperfections in the dye is very obvious to the naked eye. When pulling the discs off the center holder of a cd jewel case, the discs will bend a lot more than any other disc I've used. You can tell these are low quality without even burning on them. I'm surprised I had a few successful burns. I will never buy these discs again and will stick to my favorite TDKs and Verbatims for a few dollars more."
1,Waste Money-Buy Memorex cd-rs,you dont have to be an auditech to know junk. and Memorex is junk. out of a pack of 25 cd's 4 actually burned right. i do a lot of burning and tell people that buyme blank cd's dont get memorex ever. there should be a class action lawsuit against them for putting out an inferior product. i boughta no name brand pack and they worked perfectly.
3,Just your basic 100 pack of disks,This is just a basic pack of 100 black disks. Nothing special or non-special about it.
3,"Not the best CD-Rs, but far from the worst","Over the years I've used several different brands of CD-Rs and CD-RWs. Memorex is a solid brand, most of the disks on a spindle will burn fine, though you will gt some coasters.Personally, I'd prefer to use FujiFilm CDs (which are much more reliable), but Memorex is a better value. But for reliability and value, go with Imation."
1,Won't play on many machines,"Stay away from Memorex CD-R's. They burn fine but will not play on many cd changers, Sony for one. If you have Pioneer changers, they will work but I'd be leery all the same."
5,Memorex CDR,"I have bought these many times, they work great. Never had a problem. Will continue to buy when needed. Very good quality"
4,We had a bit of problems with some of these.,"We use these in our church ministry, and normally we purchase memorex. However, we had a couple packs that quite a few of them would not record on them."
1,These CD-Rs do not work on my Vaio Matshita drive,"I have a Sony Vaio VPCCW notebook with Windows 7 and Matchita DVD-RAM UJ890AS. Bought Memorex 700MB/80-Minute 52x CD-R Media (100-Pack Spindle). I now own a stack of 17 unusable Memorex CD-Rs that failed a disk copy of a simple audio disk, and 3 (three) that succeeded. I'm going to throw this stack out and buy another brand. It was certainly a waste of money and time for me. Too bad I didn't buy from Amazon; I'd get my money back."
2,Check every one after you burn it,"I bought a 100-CD spindle last year .. out of the 90, at least 6 have so far been bad CDs .. I mainly bought this ""Made in India"" version because I just got tired of the ""Made in China"" cheap stuff .. I thought perhaps Indian Quality may be better .. but it was not.They are cheap ( I think mine came to less than $0.45 per CD ) but you have to double check each CD after you burn them to make sure it can play back.I know, I am as guilty as everyone else for buying the ""cheaper"" ones and driving our manufacturers out of US and into third world countries, where Quality Assurance is just not high on their Agenda .."
1,Worked fine... for one CD,"I burned a CD and it worked fine. I then burned another one, and it failed the verification.I figured it was a bad CD as sometimes they are bad, so I tried another. I wasn't even able to get my laptop to recognize it.I've tried a total of ten CDs, included the first two mentioned. I have been unable to get any of them to work now. Which is strange considering that the first worked fine for a bit, and I was able to attempt to burn the second.Also, I know it's not the CD drive because other CDs that I've burned work fine. And the 50-pack of DVDs from memorex work fine also.I also compared the CDs to other CDs I have, and they appear to be the same in diameter, thickness, and smoothness."
5,Burning Media,"When it comes down to Memorex, they definitelya great head on knowing what is great media to record files from. That has been shown very well with this package of 100 CD-R discs. They work great at burning your music and media files for your computer. I like them because Memorex makes simple and easy to read discs that can just about work on any CD Player or DVD Player whenever you want to watch a film or a television show, and are easy to understand. If you need to brun any photos or any other things from your computer and share it with others, than I absolutely recommend Memorex and their products. This 100 pack of CD-R discs are really worth the money.Price: A-Convience: A-Overall: A-"
5,"Great discs, Lousy packaging",Since this is a product review I must give it 5 stars. However the packaging does not even rate 1 star. I ordered 2 100 CD spindles and they were shipped in a box with bubble wrap on onlt 2 sides. They could rattle around and bang against each other and the sides of the box. One of the containers was broken open but fortunatley none of the discs were damaged. I have used several with great success. The price was also very reasonable.
1,Terrible Experience with memorex 700mb 52x cdr,"I bought a 100 pack of the memorex 700mb 52x cdrs, and, while they worked at first, after a month or so they all produce ""power calibration errors"" on my sony crx168b burner, winXP pro, piii600, CD architect, EZCD, etc.. The burner works fine with all other brands. Have not been able to test on another burner, but even this performance is unacceptable. While I have had sucess with memorex in the past, I will look for alternatives in the future. I hope I can save someone the trouble I experienced.best,jbg"
2,Feeling Cheated,"I found this product to be at a very good price as well, which was my reason for my purchase. When the package arrived today, The container ""spindle"" was taped closed, not wrapped in plastic. I then noticed that the package wasn't a full 100 CD-R package. I then cut open the tape and counted my product to know that I was short 26 cds. This is not the way to do business because I paid for 100, not 74. I will not be purchasing anything else through this lender and I DO NOT recommend them."
3,They're CD-Rs.,"What is there to say? They work and they're cheap for branded merchandise. If you're superstitious about brands and drive combinations, pay more money. Your loss, if you would."
2,Change for the Worse,"I too have bought hundreds of Memorex blank CDs and DVDs. Always been happy, up to now. With the changed packaging comes a change in the disc quality. They are thinner, cheaper looking and, for some reason the spindle I got smelled awful. I know, that sounds like a bad western, but that's the way it is. After years with Memorex, I'll be trying other brands."
1,Mixed experience,"After using a 100-pack of these with no problems, I did not hesitate to buy another. Sadly my experience with the second lot was very poor. I estimate that about 15% failed to burn. The failures normally occurred near the end of the burn, which corresponds to the outer edge of the disk. As a result I will not purchase this brand again, since it appears that they do not have good process control from one lot to another. Keep in mind that Amazon's return policy is not designed for items that you use up over time. Thirty days after purchase you are on your own."
5,Memorex,"My burner loves these dics. They burn faster than any other name brands I've tried and they never error. They were cheaper on Amazon than Ebay, with free shipping to boot (two spindles)."
4,CD Review,The Memorex CD_R 100 pack meets my expectation. It is primerily used to convert LP records to CD for use in current CD Players.
4,"Excellent tool for instructors, challenging for students.","I have used this textbook for Child Development 1 courses and I have found the textbook to be quite thorough and extensive in its coverage of development. I also like the way the author has grouped different developmental areas together so that the text uses a more system dynamics approach to development. For the student, however, care should be taken to review key terms and content matter areas for understanding or comprehension as the text can be daunting to beginning college students. The study guide is most helpful and if you can find the instructor's guide, it is extremely helpful. It provides a list of accompanying activities, resources and a wealth of supplemental information."
5,Outstanding,Very happy Perfect Arrived quickly Thats all I had to say So it sucks that this has to be twenty
4,Gas Caddy,"Good product, well made and serves its purpose. The only problem I have is that the container ""flares"" out at the bottom and rubs on the wheels, sometimes making it hard to roll when the caddy is full."
2,"Appears to be some ""misinformation""","when I purchased the item, I was under the impression that it was steel and not plastic - otherwise why didn't say ""poly"" like the other fuel Caddies???Although I never kept a copy of the original add, I believe it came with a ""pump"". Now the ad says optional. For a plastic closed bucket, with air tires (instead of the more modern poly-foam - never need air)$370 is way too much. Doesn't seem strong enough to hold 28 gallons."
5,Great Knife,"As you may know, Wusthof knives are top quality. Although 6 inches may seem short for a chef's knife, this knife is better suited as the everyday small-job knife, where you might just be cooking for yourself.Personally, I use this knife most when I am cooking mexican food or making breakfast when i need to dice up a little bit of onion, a little bit of tomato and a little bit of everything else. The short length of the blade comes in handy when you have a limited amount of counter space such as in an apartment.The handle is fantastic! Not only does it look killer, but it doesn't slip when it gets wet or oily. It is also a great fit for people with small or large hands. I have small hands, and i love this series of knives, and my brother who has large hands finds these handles to work for him as well.This knife is too short to do large chopping jobs, but it works great for smaller ones. Great for Asian cooking as well."
5,My Aunt Loved This DVD,"I gave this DVD to my aunt for Christmas because she wanted to see Pavarotti in the opera La Traviata. (She has several of Pavarotti's operas but not that one.) However, this was the only DVD in which I found excerpts from La Traviata. She was thrilled with the quality and content of this concert w/Sutherland & didn't mind not having the whole opera."
4,Pretty Good,"I actually really liked this CDsome of the songs were really catchyi especially liked ""Kiss me Fool""Really Catchy Cd plus her voice is Great!!Go buy the Cd its awsum!"
1,So much potential,"I think that Dobson has much potential, since she clearly shows a lot of effort in her videos. However, I must say that her credibility is questionable and causes a certain discomfort when the viewer watches them. She might be too young to emerge on the scene. One thing is for sure, she has vocal ability and an apparent drive to succeed. In my opinion of amateur music listener, I think she needs to be backed up my solid videos. The ones that are out now, eventhough the pop songs are catchy and distributable, makes the viewer unhook right away and ask one question: Why is this young girl not improving her game before coming out full of pretentions. 1 star for the current, 5 for the potential. You rock Dobson!"
2,What Is This?,"I had no idea who this chick was until I went to Rent-A-Center one day and her video was being played on the big screen TV. I was like, what? So I looked into her background, listened to this CD, and I have come to the conclusion that she is a sugar-free chocolate-covered Avril Lavigne. For someone who has been interested in punk/rock&roll music all their young life, I was expecting something astounding on this album, something that would make her stand out and have people take notice. There was none of that on here. Even though Fefe (Felicia) can carry a tune, every song on here was dull and forgettable. This album was void of bass, funk, melody, rock, roll, attitude, and, most importantly, soul. It's just generic pop music masked as rock& roll with a lot of noisy guitars. Fe Fe Foe Fum, this album turned out to be kind of dumb. Foo Foo Foe Fee, don't even bother wasting your money. Trust me on this one, FeFe's not doing any thing unique and you're not missing anything. Holla!"
1,Holy Lord The music industry is trying to kill everyone...,"First off, to everyone who says FeFe Dobson is a punk-rock chick shall be banished from Earth. Secondly, after listening to her CD, I felt as if I should immediately rush to the bathroom, stick the towel rack bars through my forehead, and rip out my eardrums with my fingernails. FeFe's voice: does screeching cat on heat come to mind? Why yes it does.Her first single recieved very little airplay on MTV and radio which served it justice. Whomever tries to market this girl as a rockandroll wildchild is mentally disturbed. THIS girl, not Avril, is desecrating the name of rock and punk. ""Take Me Away"" is pop, no way around it, and you people need to understand these things.After hearing the $7 CD (which is actually worth like $.05... well, that might be too generous) I have come to the conclusion that the music reps. are trying to make everyone kill themselves.Do not buy this piece of crap even if its your last chance to survive on earth."
3,"Pop, not rock.","This is a good POP album. I don't believe it is in any way, shape, or form a rock or punk album. I classify her with the likes of Avril Lavigne (who's given WAY too much credit for being ""punk"") and Ashley Simpson. Just because there's more guitar strings and drums does NOT make Fefe rock. To Fefe's credit she doesn't sing about all that pop-sugary bs like many mainstream artists. There's some honesty of her lyrics. She's not bad vocally either, but really, Fefe doesn't have a voice like Christina or Britney (not that they're vocally masterful either), which makes her come off with a ""gritty"" kind of sound. So everyone just assumes she's punk or pop-rock because she can't hit a falsetto or the notes.Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing Fefe because I do think some of her songs are good like Everything and Don't Go, but don't buy this album if you're looking for something to rock out to. Go buy Smashing Pumkins or if you want something rock-ish and mainstream, try No Doubt."
3,"Fefe, do your thing!","I just the read the review written by Tanika from Brentwood, NY and I cannot believe the ignorance displayed. Considering myself one of ""your people"" (FYI- both myself and Ms. Dobson are biracial), you need to get it straight. We can perform in ANY musical genre we desire. How incredibly narrow-minded to say that we ""don't do grunge or punk""! Where do you think the roots of rock 'n roll lie? With us, in the southern blues of the 40's and 50's. Your comment is so typical of the misconception that skin color or race has anything to do with music. All that said, Fefe's album is a nice pop/punk piece akin to Avril and I wish her all the luck in this business."
4,"Great buy, well worth ten bucks","I heard the single ""take me away"" and decided to get this album, simply because it was only 6.99 at Best Buy the first week. I was so completely surprised at how much I liked this CD that I bought some more for my friends. They thought I was crazy, judging by the cover of this album (she looks like a wannabe Avril), but it grew on them too. This album was in heavy rotation for a few weeks there, I kept trying to listen to something new but would always put it back on. My favorite track is hands down the very last one, that's not listed on the track list (i'm not sure what the title is). 'Everything' is also an awesome one. Honestly there are only a couple songs on this that I don't love. Most of them I will repeat over and over again. Don't ask me why.. My other favorites: jason mraz, beyonce, mya, audioslave, tlc."
2,I forgot I owned this CD.,"I was cleaning out my car this weekend, and discovered this CD had slipped below the passenger seat. Probably been there for three months. I had listened to it twice, put it back in its case, and absentmindedly tossed it aside. That about sums up this album - easily forgotten."
4,FeFe does great music,At first I just got the album because I liked her first single (Take me away). To be honest I had a gift certifcate to best buy and I figured if it sucked at least I did not waste my money. I loved the album from the moment I put it on. I think it is a great album. Even my husband liked it. You would not think Fefe was 18 years old. I would not believe that an 18 yr old wrote half of these lyrics. I thought she did a great job. Someone wrote a review that this would only appeal to 15 year olds. Well I am 26 years old and I like this album. If you are looking for a 15 year old type album go get Hilary Duff. Fefe is not in that catagory. She is a true artist. And it shows in this album.
5,Wow..,"I didn't really think ""Stupid Little Love Song"" was a good start to the cd.. but as I listened to the rest of the songs.. I started to love it. I related a lot to most of the songs.. and I haven't been able to put down my cd player.. ""Bye Bye Boyfriend"" and ""We went for a Ride"" are my favorite tracks.. ""We Went for a Ride"" is just amazing sounding.. and it makes you want to hop in your car at night with your boyfriend or girlfriend.. and spend the whole night together. From what I've heard.. she's really good live too.. so she's not fake. Get this album.. she's amazing.. and it's worth it."
4,Actually Really Good,"I just had to go out and buy this album once I heard the first single, 'Take Me Away', and I was actually surprised at how good the album was! I liked Take Me Away but then I heard Stupid Little Love Song and was a little taken aback. But continuing on with the album I came to find that Fefe Dobson is actually an incredible musician both lyrically and musically. The songs are upbeat and fun with the ever-important ballads thrown into the mix yet they all have a meaning you can relate to. Way to go FeFe!!!"
4,Canadian Wave of New Rockers,"hello out there!Is it true, Canada really contributes to the world? Yes! Within the past few years, a wave of canadian rockers have been finding their way into American mainstream such as Nickelback, Default, Alanis Morrisette, Kittie, and the newest rock star, Fefe Dobson, with her mix of nu-metal and acoustic sound, her self-titled debut album is rocking young people everywhere. Every song on her album displays a different form of rock, from the punk driven ""stupid little love song"" to mellow/acoustic ""revolution song"" to the lyrically deep, nu-metal/heavy driven ""unforgiven"". She is an excellent musician who writes her own music (which many people do not) and the lyrics are powerful and meaninful, in which today's young people can relate to. She shows much promise and looks to have a promising future and career in music."
3,Impressive but still a ways to go,"Fefe is off to a good start: good lyrics, interesting effects, an impressive variety of musical styles (rock, pop, ballads, rap). But she shoots herself in the foot with (I'm not exagerrating) ""la-da-da-dee, oh-oh-uh-huh"". what the heck is that? Her attention span ran out and she couldn't be bothered to find some more words to fill in? Cut that stuff out and you have yourself a gem of a singer. Best tracks: 1, 4, 10."
2,It really wasn't worth my $15,"Wow. I've never found it hard to listen to a CD all the way through, but this one wouldn't let me. I liked the first song, entitled ""Stupid Little Love Song"". ""Bye Bye Boyfriend"" thouroughly annoyed me. ""Take Me Away"", her first single that I heard, really rocks. I like the sound, it sounds like rock, but the lyrics are a bit lame. I can't really say anything bad about ""Everything"", but it sounds a bit like Avril. There are no words left to describe the rest of the CD because I couldn't fully listen to any tracks past 4. ""Rock It Till You Drop It"" is bad. They say the title a few times, but it doesn't really tie into the sound or meaning of the track. Next time, I'll just buy Hilary Duff or Lillix. But I guess that's what I get for buying something with an MTV sticker of approval on it."
1,sigh,"Oh please, this girl is NOT rock. If this WAS rock, I'd shoot myself.Lame, crap, garbage, total worthless piece of junk. Disgusting."
3,Don't Know About This One,"Black women in rock is a rare thing. Only Tina Turner and a few others have done it and done it well. Febe (biracial) has not. For one, she is missing the three most important elements to be a rocker and those are range, power and fire. I consider this cd ""Pop"". Nothing more and nothing less. I can't knocked the album completely because there are some nice ""Pop"" songs on here, but I am largely disappointed."
3,Fefe Dobson - an Avril clone,"When Fefe released Everything in the UK, everyone caled her an Avril clone. This is why she bombed. Nobody likes artists or songs that are clones of others. This event will make it very hard for Fefe ever to make it in the UK as people will immediately dismiss as her as an Avril-wannabe with Avril being massive here. But Fefe isn't an Avril clone at all. Take me away is an incredible song and would have seen her shoot up the charts. Unforgiven is another example of a hit single. But Bye bye boyfriend is just dreadful while Everything and Rock it til you drop it are lovely pop/rock songs. And then there's Rainbow which is just drivel. Not forgetting the song Don't go girls and boys which is possibly the worst song she's ever done. fefe has the potential to be something amazing - all she needs is the right people around her."
5,I love this record,"There is a little of everything and this record. Up-tempo songs, deep songs, catchy songs, and ballets."
4,worth the money,"Over all this is a pretty good cd, Fefe writes her own music for the most part, has a good voice and her own style. According to ""Ashley"" from her Augest 31 review, Fefe should turn into Paris Hilton and sing pure pop. The reason Fefe is great is that she is herself and origional. Shes not my favorite, but defiently a good listen."
5,"A Real Album, No Bull","Excellent range, fabulous vocals, insane sound. Fefe Dobson has originality, not a poser punk overdone with stereotypes. If you were disappointed with Avril Lavigne, Fefe will make up for her and then some. Highly Recommended."
3,I LOVE IT!,"The rating on this CD all depends on your type of music. Now, personally, I am in love with her music, but I'm also VERY weird. At times, I was even saying, ""Oh my gosh, what was she thinking when she wrote this one???"". But when I listen to some others, I can't stop singing. Some of it is very catchy. It's a half and half. It reminds me a lot the 80's girl power rock music. If you like this type then I definatly recommend this album to you!"
1,horrible,"Expecting it to be good. I listened to the first two songs and they were terrible. I love the song Take Me Away, but other than that, it's a really bad CD. Don't waste your money."
1,OH NO!!!!!!!!!!!!,"You have got to be kidding?!!!?? Okay, here's the deal. I love to see my people make it in the world. We've been struggling enough as it is. But for this black chick to start making grunge albums is too much for me to bare. When I first heard fefe Dobson, I thought just another grunge person on the scene. But when I saw her, I damn near fainted. FeFe, we sing R&B, Rap, and Jazz, and the blues not grunge or punk my dear. So, I gave this album one star because she's a black artist. Other than that, even though I don't have this album, it sucks."
5,Rock It Till you Drop it!,"Fefe Dobson's self titled debut is an incredible addition to anyone's collection. Full of catchy punk pop influenced tunes Fefe expresses relationships, anger, problems and typical teenaged life through 13 songs. The variety on the album is amazing. While songs like ""Stupid Little Love Song"" are up beat and punk-poppy, songs like ""Everything"" mellow down and are calm and more soft rock. The album is a must buy!"
4,Excellent debut!,"I love this CD. It had a great balance of rock/punk and of pop as well. She has a very good voice and very catchy melodies. I about died when I heard Tone Loc on one of the tracks. My favorite song on this CD that I could (and I do) listen to over & over is: ""Bye Bye Boyfriend"" - awesome song! Very well crafted! This is a great buy!"
4,Ignorance is not always Bliss,"First, I would like to apologize for the ingorance that some people in my race have. FeFe Dobson cd is fabulous , she very energetic and fun. I love her music and and the style of her songs. Its about time that Afro-Americans start up lifting our people instead of giving them negative feed back when others want to be different. Its sad to hear that someone thinks we only have talent for R&B, Rapp, Neo-soul and the other stereotypical things that BLACKS are suppose to be good at. Ingnorance is a dieases that is taking over our race and unless we do something to stop it , I am afraid that the Black race will not be able to succeded or surpass stereotypical views that the world see's us in."
1,Don't waste your money,"I actually got this album as a gift. Thank god I didn't spend money on it! I think that Fefe is a mediocre artist and will probably be her last album . This is certified teenie bopper music, made not to last. I hope I saved any potential buyers some cash."
1,disapointing,"i cant believe i wasted my money on this garbage.. only 'stupid little love song' and 'bye bye boyfriend' are OK. just OK. everything else sucks. if you like poppy punk poser music, (avril, good charlotte, simple plan, lilix and all of those so called artists/bands) this is for you. fefe sounds like a dead cow gargling on oatmeal. take me away and everything are horrible. what also annoys me is that my name is the title of one of the tracks. grrr.."
4,Cool,"Enjoyable album. FeFe Dobson has a very spunky voice, and lyric could be more mature in some songs, however the lyrics are very deep adn personal form an eighteen year old."
5,Great CD,At only 18 FeFe Dobson writes her own songs. She is also amazing live. A winning combination.
5,FeFe Dobson is Pop Rock. This album proves it.,"It you are exepecting b*llsh*t like Hilary Duffs Metamorphosis or Avril Lavignes let go, then you've come to the wrong artist.FeFe Dobson has always said she is Pop Rock, and that EXACTLY what you get with this album. FeFe Dobson is a true original, the same cannot be said of Hilary Duff and all the other posers out there."
5,True Pop/Rock album.,"If you like Gwen Stefani or Blink 182, you will probably like FeFe Dobson. FeFe Dobsona and Gwen Stefanti are artist that cut from the same cloth.If you get you see FeFe live, it is a treat. She dances, and goes crazy on stage. Think Gwen Stefani in her younger days."
4,Surprisingly good,"I bought her CD after reading the song lyrics off a site. It's an amazing CD and Fefe does have the talent. If you compare her to fellow Canadian Avril Lavigne, Fefe is way ahead in the game. She co-writes all the songs with producer Jay Levine and gets her inspiration from Nirvana, Michael Jackson, etc. My favourite songs on the CD are tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10. Although Tracks 2 and 3 were overplayed, I still found them quite enjoyable at times. Her fourth track is featured in the movie ""The Perfect Score"". I personally didn't like 8x10. From the lyrics, I thought it would have been a more upbeat song. And the Revolution Song, the name was pretty much misleading. I also thought it would be a song like Unforgiven, which was strong. Overall, I liked this CD a lot and if she came out with a second album, I will definitely go out and buy that one too!"
1,How can anyone give this 5 stars??!,"If you give this cd 5 stars you must have no taste of music or just be plainly retarded. This isnt punk, hardcore or anythin its just friggin garbage.I would rather listen to tunes coming out of a nintendo. How hardcore can anyone be with the name fefe anyways. If i had a cat i would name it Fefe..actually i wouldnt because it would remind me how terrible this music is. My rating -5 stars."
1,I'm Sorry But This is Awful,"Isn't that song ""Everything"" a combination of Red Hot Chili Peppers ""Under the Bridge"" and Alanis Morissette's ""Head Over Feet""? Probably just different enough not to require a law suit. This girl needs to find a sound that's not so lame and over done. Much respect for getting a record deal."
1,No Avril,"you are no avril sweetheart, nor will you ever be one. End of story. Buy Avril's Let Go or Under My Skin instead!"
1,SHE SUCKS!,"...She is the worst!I've never heard such garbage.If you want REAL music,buy Lillix's Falling Uphill.(Much better than this..."
5,Worth getting! ;),"This is one of the best albums that I have ever purchased! All of the songs are increadible! I am very impressed that these songs were written by such a young,talented person. Seldom, have i listend to a cd the whole way through and loved EVERY song! I hope she keeps up the good work! TrÃ©s bien Fefe! :)"
4,Get Adicted!,"Wow, one of my all time fav live albums, they sound great live and this is a great live album. Missing a couple of my other favorite songs or I would have no problem giving 5 stars, o a solid 4, to 4 and a half."
5,best adicts release,"you must admit, the adicts sound so much better on this live compilation than they do in the studio. they play faster and more turbo charged on this and turn even the lightest song into a headbanger."
5,"A ""must have"" for any true Lanza fan","I have loved Mario Lanza since I was a child. How can one not! That voice can make you cry, make you happy, make you feel emotions you didn't think possible to feel just from listening to music. It was actually listening to Mario Lanza, that made me appreciate opera and the classics. Something that otherwise I may never have bothered listening to. This collection of 3cds deserves 10 stars. Disc one has his Legendary Hits and his most romantic love songs. Disc 2 has his more exotic songs like 'Lygia' and 'Lady of Spain'. Then there are some terrific rarities from 'The Mario Lanza Show'. Disc 3 features some movie songs and then some fantastic Opera arias. This collection is also all digitally remastered, so the sound quality is wonderful. If you are a fan of Lanza, please, you need this collection. It is wonderful. And the 20 page booklet is packed with photos and an insightful essay on Lanza's life."
4,saw them live,"I do not own this album. Yeah yeah, I know how anoying it is when people give reviews of items they have not yet experienced. That being said... I have seen this band perform live and MAN! did they rock! If the album is anything like their live performance, I highly recomend it. The only reason I don't own it yet is because I spent the last of my money on the cover charge getting into the bar and was out of cash when they started selling CD's. Don't make the same mistake! The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because I can't garuntee that the album is as great at their show."
4,I Really Liked It,"What a nice story. Abby becomes a 23 year old orphin when she loses her preacher father in a tornado/hurricane (can't remember) Raising 6 other orphined children with no income and repairs up the wazoo on the house/barn/fields will take all her energy. A salesman comes by with his helper Sam who decides to stay and help her get things organized. He has secrets that may make things difficult for her to overcome when she finds out. There are a few side issues/stories and a villian that keeps things hopping. This was very well done and I danced the jig having gotten this as a free download yesterday. I would have gladly paid more than the $3 that is being currently charged for it since I liked it that much. There is one scene of intimacy done tastefully, very light questionable language, some violence and one scene I didn't like that involved a horse but the horse was ok afterall so don't worry. I'll be searching for other books by this author. Happy Reading and Enjoy as I did."
4,Heart warming,"The only reason I give it a four and not a five is that I felt it was two short. The story is complete, but more could be said. It touches your soul how Abigale doesn't let anything get in her way as she struggles to rebuild after a tornado and the death of her father. Her faith is strong and with that she knows God will show her the way to keep the kids whom each of them had been adopted by her father. Sam offers to help her rebuild and also offers to marry her in order to keep the kids. At the same time their love for each other grows."
4,Suddenly a Bride,I really liked this book. Very enjoyable. It showed God's everyday little miracles that we usually overlook or believe is coincidence.
3,Good read!,This was a fast read. Well written and i couldnt put it down. I loved Sam! He was a great hero.
2,Not a Christian book,When I read the description of this book I immediately thought it was going to be a Christian novel. Most Christian novels you read have no descriptive sex scenes but this one does. I know I will get flack from other readers for writing this review but I am just telling it like it is. There are a couple of mild sex scenes in this book between husband and wife and when Sam tells about his past life. There is also an attempted rape scene. Overall it is your typical romance novel good to read if you have nothing else to read or do.
3,good but could have been great...,...if the heroine wouldn't have been so horrible! I was actually hoping the hero would divorce her. Author is great though...solid writing.
3,nice reading,"this book is a pleasant reading. One can find romance, action, suspence in it, and all well distributed. the characters are well developed, as well as the romance blossoming between Abigail and Sam. Still there are some parts which I find not realistic at all, like Tucker surviving the first attack or a farm girl like Abigail comparing her self to ""an actress without a script""."
5,Book was in good condition as described & arrived rapidly,Book provides observations on fall of France at that time by someone who had access to the those in the upper reaches of power in France and England.
4,Really good for research,This book was incredibly useful for research purposes. I had an assignment on Interpersonal skills and interviewing techinques and the book gave quotations which generally happens in practice. So i was able to compare an contrast what happens in practice with written literature.
4,Not too shabby!,"Let me tell you folks, when my late husband received this fork as a gift from one of his clients, my first thought was, ""Return it and let's get the cash!"". Luckily we kept it around long enugh to realize what an asset it is to our kitchen. This fork has two prongs which is perfect for any job you would want it for. Our cook, Frances, just loves it, and refuses to carve with anything else. In fact, I just bought him one for his own family for Christmas! What can I say, I know how to treat my staff!"
5,Really special,"I purchased this book just before my family went to Ireland a few years ago. We chose several places from the book as places we'd like to visit, and they really lived up to their billing. We've taken our chances and stayed at bed and breakfasts all over Ireland on other visits. This book made it easy to find a beautiful spot to stay. Most of the B&Bs from the book didn't require more than a few nights notice, so our travelling experience was still just as spontaneous as if we hadn't made any plans at all. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is planning a travelling holiday in Ireland and who wants to stay at some truly special spots!"
1,Actually two pieces - mine all rusted at the joint!,"I really liked the look and feel of the Wusthof's Culinar line and had three pieces from it. I had only used them for a couple of weeks when they started to rust! The company leads you to believe that the Culinar knives are made from a single piece construction, but they are actually *two pieces* and there is a joint. Mine all rusted right at that joint, just from normal kitchen use. Needless to say I was very disappointed...I have switched to the Wusthof Classic line instead. I do not recommend buying the Culinar line knives."
2,"A PALLID REHASH OF ""BEAUTIFUL THING""","It's nice to see an intelligent, compassionate film about a young gay boy finding love in a very positive, supportive society (NOT in Texas, by the way, as the title might suggest, but in Belgium, where gay marriage has been legal for some time). But I (for one) found the young leading man in this film one of the dullest young actors I've ever seen. Perhaps he's deliberately so, since the character he plays is baleful, moody, and spiteful: altogether a real pill. But (the movie suggests) even a ""pill"" can find love in Belgium. The British film BEAUTIFUL THING covers the same topography with a much more sympathetic protagonist and an ebulliant score featuring Mama Cass recordsings. [If you must see it, get an All-Region DVD player from Philips and start buying your foreign films from British Amazon for a fraction of the price scalpers charge you as middle-men.]"
1,Not worth even $14,This knife was purchased to replace an eons old Sunbeam Electric Knife. This Proctor Silex is heavy and too large in diameter - not for arthritic hands - and the first use to slice an Artisan Loaf of bread was such a trial that I gave it up and used my regular bread knife. This was not purchased from Amazon but rather from a local retailer and now I'm shopping Amazon to find a good electric knife - which is what I should have done in the first place. Hope the Amazon reviewers of electric knives are telling their true opinions of the electric knives recently purchased.
5,Works Great!,I bought this knife for Thanksgiving to replace my old one and it worked great!It sliced my turkey just fine...I thought it would just get put away and that would be it.But I've been using it at least once a week for roasts/london broils etc.
2,Too big/jagged cut,"I've used a Black & Decker slimline knife for 15 years. It still works better than the new Traditions electric knife by Proctor Silex. The new Trimline is heavier, and so large that I can't get my fingers all around it.Also, it cuts with a ragged look. My turkey breast had ridges. I'll keep my old Slimline."
1,Not Cotton as listed,"These may work well, but I wanted cotton patches and these are synthetic per Outers web site[..]I will return them because cotton does a better job."
4,Motivating Music,Good music to put on an MP3 player for exercising. CD played and ripped with no problems. No scratches or marks on CD.
3,"Good Steel, Wrong Price","There are really two main competitors in the high-end mainstream kitchen knife market: Henckels and Wusthof. Those who have used both usually have a preference. My preference (and therefore bias you should know about) is for the Wusthofs.However, when it comes to sharpening steels, I have found very little difference. As long as you buy a high end steel, you really won't go wrong. Therefore, I shop for this item on price, and Henckels has a price advantage. Unless you want a matching set, shop on price, and look to Henckels."
3,Nice Album. Good Songs.,"I bought this album for one song ""A little bit of heaven"", because I love the Soap-Opera ""Santa Barbara"" (in Germany ""California Clan"") The other songs are good and the quality of this album is also ok. I know that this album is a little bit older, but old wine is the best wine :-))I want to say some words to the amazon.com team:Your service is very good, very friendly and nice eMail Contact. You have found one more happy customer :-))P.S. Please excuse my bad english. ;-)Much GreetingsKarin from Germany"
2,Decor not Toy,Thought was really cute but the child I bought it for has not even played with it or even pays attention to it.
4,Good toy - not the softest,"I bought this for my child who loves webskinz and really wanted a leopard or jaguar. He loves it and it is a good quality toy, but it is not the softest toy. The long hair is a little rough (but so is my child - they are a good match...)."
5,darling,This Webkinz stuffed animal is just darling. I bought it for a gift for my daughter that loves kitty's. She Love it!
5,great knife!,"Love this knife! I have 3 knives I use on a daily basis and this is one of them. Normally I prefer Henckels knives, but this one is great performer.It's great for slicing tomatoes, fruits, sandwiches, bagels, etc. The serrated edge is ideal for these tasks and the blade length is just right."
1,ME SIENTO ESTAFADO. ES SOLO UN ESCRITO EN SUS INICIOS.,No me explico como pueden colocar semejante carnada para atrapar incautos. Me siento idiota por no haber leido completo. Yo buscaba solo el libro : media noche en el jar.......
5,Beautiful CD - haunting songs and melodies,This CD has haunting songs and melodies that just stay in your mind. Soft and mellow but quietly powerful!
5,consideration of the American West and Midwest in literature,"This is a book to base a literature class on, or to spur (pun intended)personal investigation of what makes American literature unique. From the jacket: ""Bredahl provides readings of major pieces of western narrative in order to show how these works respond to an environment that will not tolerate enclosure. His discussion of western writers is extended by an examination of John Ford and Sam Peckinpah."" 195 pages, indexed, bibliography."
2,Only for INXS fans.,"It's terrible, but if you own the rest of the albums, it's worth listening to. So that's what 19-year-old Australians sound like."
3,First attempt for Inxs,"This is Inxs's debut album, and it didn't get much airplay in Australia at the time. A rocking post-punk New Wave album that didn't quite hit the mark upon release.Despite that, there was still some great tracks from this one,'On A Bus' and 'Just keep Walking' spring to my mind. Their cover of 'The Loved One' was perhaps the stand out track, and they re-covered this song later on their famousKickalbumIts hard to recommend this album as a purchase for most people, although serious Inxs fans will certainly want it in their collection to see how the lads went on their first effort.3 stars for Inxs fans, but 2 stars for all others"
3,A Good Primer,"For those that need watch their cholesterol intake, this cook book is a good place to start."
2,This book is a great disappointment -- the main meals are not low cholesterol,I cannot see how this book can claim low cholesterol because the main meals show listings that are very high.I won't keep this book because it's really no help what so ever.
1,Not for the cook in training,"I've been learning to cook with several cookbooks and have done fairly well. This book is 0 for 2. Without the pictures, anywhere, it is difficult to decide what looks delicious enough to cook after a long day at work. The wording in the directions are also a bit confusing. For example, ""In a large saucepan bring the asaparagus, salt, pepper, broth and peppers to a boil.."" Now, wouldnt you see asparagus and think, oh that needs water..?? Well no. It means to put it in the broth and bring THAT to a boil. It would have been better if it named the broth FIRST! That way you know that the liquid is the broth and therefore NO NEED FOR WATER...Which of course, made my meal bland, my husband laughing at me, and 3 hours wasted FORRRR NUTTIN!...Now I have to spend the rest of my night hungry, and annoyed!! BOO. For those learning to cook, I suggest the Martha Stewart book. Now those are pictures and well directed instructions! ....hiss...hiss..."
4,Good ideas....,The cookbook does the best it can considering the subject! What foodie wants to give up food? Not that one is giving up food per se. Maybe trying one recipe per week and gradually replacing high fat foods instead of going it cold turkey would work. There's nothing wrong with the recipes I've tried. I'd just rather be eating foods I need to let go of!
5,terrific,"I ordered this for my 23 year old grandson who suffers from high blood pressure and has diabetis on both sides of his family. He and his wife are trying the recipes, say they are tasty and easy to prepare, and I feel better knowing he is taking better care of his health."
2,Not the normal quality recipes from AHA,"I purchased this book because we have cholesterol issues in the family, and so far, I've made 3 or 4 recipes involving beef. They've been very dry and not visually appealing (with kids, this is important!:)) I've found most of the entrees have been time consuming to prepare as well, lots of ingredients. Truthfully, the only thing I'm enjoying from the book is the information in the beginning about cholesterol and how it affects your health- lots of great informative points on this but the recipes are just not very tasty. I also own American Heart Association's Meals in Minutes, which is much better."
2,I don't think I'll use it much,I like home cooking-middle America style. I am a wife and mother of a school age child and a preschooler. These recipes do not use ingredients I normally have on hand and I don't think most of them would appeal to my children. If you are looking for easy quick recipes that are low fat remakes of old favorites I would recommend the cookbooks by Dawn Hall. They are all Low Fat and delicious.
3,"Good recipes, but lacks appeal","This is another good source of low fat / low cholesterol recipes. However, if you are like me and like to see photos of what you're cooking, this cookbook isn't for you. I was very disappointed that there are no photos other than the cover. When I go through a cookbook looking for a new recipe to try, if the food looks good in a photo, I want to try the recipe. I personnaly recommend the Betty Crocker Low Fat / Low Cholesterol cookbook if you want good recipes with photos."
2,I am disappointed in this cookbook!,"I am very disappointed in this cookbook. My husband and I have just begun to watch our cholesterol and we thought an American Heart Association cookbook would be a good start. Unfortunately, I've read through the entire book and can't imagine eating this way. These low fat, low cholesterol recipes are just worked over true-blue American food which is generally inedible no matter what! I'm going to look for other cookbooks and other recipes that actually have flavor, interesting ingredients, and a reason other than ""low cholesterol"" to make it to our dinner table."
2,Disappointment,"I have used the first AHA Low-Fat, Low Cholesterol book since its publication. Have not had this issue long enough to try many of the recipes but, frankly, have not seen many that interest me. Having had a chance to look this book over first, I would not have purchased. If you are a first-time user, perhaps you will feel differently."
3,"Pretty good, but Tiesto can be soo much better !","This is one of the earlier Tiesto compilations, and although it does have a few brilliant tracks, overall it's not that great. Still, a must CD for any Tiesto fan, but for an average person who likes Trance, there are far better CDs out there(ie. Magik 6)."
4,"Beautiful, retains smudges though",This faucet looks really good and has given us no problems since installing. My only quible is that it shows finger prints and smudges very easily. It has a nice classic retro look that fits in well with my sort of organic bathoom.
5,"Beautiful faucet, perfect for Bancroft Pedestal Sink","We're really happy with the Kohler Bancroft Series in its entirety. We're in the process of remodeling our 1897 farm house and restoring the bathroom to a more traditional style with hex tiles, a claw foot tub, pedestal sink and wainscotting. The faucet matches the look perfectly and flows beautifully"
1,The worst game ever!!!!!!!,"I got this game in a 2-pack at Costco along time ago and when I put it in, I was in shock. It made abolutely no since at all. The only thing I could make out was that I was a robot droid-type thing walking around in this desert levels shooting other droid-type things. The game play was so fast I could hardly see where I was going and the controls made no sence at all. 5 minutes after I started playing this game, I took it out and played something else. Ever since that day, it has sat on my shelf and I guarantee you it will stay on my shelf, never to be played again. So if you thinking of buying this game, DON'T BY IT!"
5,Camille Paglia's BREAK BLOW BURN,"Camille Paglia's BREAK BLOW BURN contains a brilliant interpretation of forty-three of the world's best poems. Written with great clarity of expression, this study reflects once again Paglia's tremendous breadth of learning. I highly recommend Camille Paglia's BREAK BLOW BURN to anyone who is interested in understanding the meaning, structure and beauty of the poems selected by this provocative intellectual."
4,It Breaks Blows AND Burns,"Paglia's book of commentary on poems gives close sensitive readings of classics and future classics. Each 3-4 page essay, an easy read when I have just a few minutes, deepens my understanding of feelings expressed through art. Familiar poems burn brighter after reading her thoughts."
5,Words from a lover of words.,I have never appreciated more what Camille Paglia has done. How fortunate those several little known poets are to have caught her eye and thus be included in this wonderful treasure. Paglia now teaches at my alma mater and how difficult it is for me not to matriculate once again to bask in her indolence. But I am 80 now and have miles and miles to go.
2,"It's Not the Poems, It's the Readings","The book could have been useful, should have been useful, but isn't. Paglia simply reads the poems badly. Many, many details here:http://www.godofthemachine.com/archives/00000579.html"
1,"Absolutely worthless, total garbage.","Others have hinted at it, I'll call a spade a spade. This is absolute trash. What a disservice is done by this idiot even daring to ""recite"" any of these so-called classics, and the fact that she proclaims any degree of influence from Oscar Wilde is absolutely mind boggling. Clearly she's trying to seek some type of affirmation by equating herself with an individual of that caliber, or perhaps align herself with hopeless throngs of Morrissey and Ex-Smiths fanatics (admittedly I include myself in that group).To then switch to the ""modernists""...I can't even find the words to address this travesty. I'm not a poet, and never claimed to be, so perhaps my lack of words is of no consequence. But should you desire exposure to anything of the ""modern"" ilk, do yourself a favor and go get ANYTHING by Charles Bukowski, ANYTHING by John Fante, or go get any Tom Waits record from 1973 to 1988."
4,works great,"the whole process of installation was easy and the extra bolts were very useful. but make sure to be carefull if you have a mountain bike(and ge it wet regularly) because of rust in the bolt holes. i found WD-40 on the bolt holes and a few mile of riding worke real well to break the loose. the are good and great for the money, just no wow factor for the five starts, it beasts the specialty shop of $50 rotors. this is great for the DIY in every one because it is entry level skills are required. just make sure to adjust your pads all the way out before you put the rotor in to prevent damage to the pad."
3,nice set,This is a nice set of throwing knives. The design of the knives and quality of the steel is outstanding. The balance is perfect.They throw like a dream.The only drawback is the sheath. It is a pitiful thing of thin nylon.Not really suited to the task. It will shred pretty quickly and will need replacement. A heavier Cordura version would be betterOverall I am pleased.It was a great product for the price.
5,Amazing,"Buy it, rent it, it doesnt matter just watch it. Why the USA doesnt distrubite masterpieces like this is beyond me. If your a zombie fan this is a must have"
5,Its the tits,I love this show... every single episode is awesome and the ending is one of the best zombie film endings ever imho ...
5,feminist fabulousness!!!,"If you call yourself a feminist and haven't seen this movie you should be ashamed of yourself. It is smart, fun, exciting, and powerful. The film also highlights most of the threads of feminist thought going on during the 60's-70's and contrasts them nicely through the main character's discussions. Feminist/socialist/futurology what could be better!"
1,Concerned that it contains BPA,This would be a fabulous product if it could be made without BPA. I sent my two containers back after learning they contained BPA. I would rather spend more money on a safer choice.
3,Bulky,Bought this for bread dough. It turns out a 4-quart container would have been suffucient. It takes up a lot of space in the refrigerator. Works best for brining.
5,Bread maker must,Purchased this item to go along with the cook book since the bread mixture can be stored in the frig for up to a week. Very useful for other cooking needs.Comes with a lid as well.
1,BPA plastic,"I bought this item to make ""Bread in 5 Minutes a Day,"" too. Great book! However, when I recieved the Cambro round, I sent it back. It is made of plastic #7, shown inside the recycling symbol on the bottom. Plastic #7 can contain BPA. If you are trying to avoid BPA in food storage items, I would avoid this item. Some states already have laws requiring baby food products be BPA-free and the FDA has medical concerns about it, including potential links to breast and prostate cancer and early onset puberty. Why add more to my home? I would hope Amazon would add the plastic type to this item's product description to inform customers."
5,A MUST HAVE.,"I've been using Cambro containers for years. I just bought this round 6 quart to make my dough for Artisan Bread In Five Minutes. I have the square containers, but the round is easier to use as the dough doesn't get trapped in the corners.I use them to store large batches of stews, soups, etc.. overnight. The next day I remove the fat and serve what I need and freeze the rest in FoodSaver bags in individual or larger servings. Lids are sold separately - so don't forget to order one. Cambro can be purchased at most restaurant supply stores either clear or translucent. They come in 2 - 4- 6 - 8 quart sizes (and much larger too). I bought the 4 qt. to use when I half the dough recipe,They are not airtight so you cannot freeze in them - nor can you use them in the oven.P.S. I don't work for the Cambro ... I wish I did - then I would get their stuff cheaper :-)"
3,"Come on, where's the lid?","I ordered this storage container because it showed us as an ""also purchased"" for people who bought the 5 minute Artisan bread book. It was obviously something I'd need, and free shipping w/Amazon Prime, so I didn't spend much time thinking about the order nor did I read the reviews. So, I was pretty surprised when it arrived with no lid and then I discovered that Amazon charges as much for the lid as for the container and takes 3-5 weeks to deliver.The container is fine and I'll use it. But come on now, Amazon. Either give us the lid or clearly show it as a ""better together"" choice so customers don't get surprised when they order."
4,perfect for bread making,Light weight plastic container is excellent for bread dough storage. I did expect it to come with a lid which it doesn't. It is clear plastic with markings and fits easily in the frig. for storage of bulk dough.
5,One of the Best Opera Performances available on disc,"This is an excellent performance of the less well known French version of Gluck's Orphee et Eurydice. The cast is excellent and it is amazing to hear a high tenor perform the role of Orphee as orignally written, instead of a contralto. The performance is not so much a modern update as a more naturalistic performance. The colour and movement of this production is both exciting and daring (trying hanging on to a swinging wall!!!) This is an excellent introduction to opera, as well as an essential disc is any collector's library."
4,Observations,"I enjoyed this book, but I'm not quite sure why. The character of Bessie is the only one fleshed out in any capacity. I never could decide if her mistress was really sane or not, or if her husband was supposed to be a 'good' or 'bad' guy. The mystery revolving around the strange tasks Bessie is asked to do, and the fate of the servant that came before her kept me involved in the story, but I was disappointed in the lackadaisical way these were resolved. I was especially unhappy about how Bessie's attitude towards her mistress abruptly changes from dislike to adoration- without any real cause.Despite these facts however, the book is an easy and mostly enjoyable read (I just needed a little vent first). Especially if you like your historical fiction... heavy on the fiction side. Which I do."
3,disappointing,"After reading glowing reviews, I was very disappointed in this novel. The character of Arabelle is not developed at all and her husband is even more vague. The whole mystery around Nora is concluded in such a predictible way that I was frustrated by the ""secret'.If I had not been trapped in an airplane with nothing else to read I would have given up on this soap opera story within the first 100 pages."
2,Prolonged meanderings,"It took me forever to finish this book. The ""observations"" were repetitive and the plot meandered aimlessly. It was not a ""page turner"" by any stretch of the imagination. Bessy Buckley was a plucky lass, but a little pluck goes a long way and cannot in and of itself sustain interest."
3,Definitely different!,"I still don't know what to make of Ms Harris' debut novel.I definitely loved Bessy's language and her wacked opinions and thoughts, but the Missus and her delusions... she was already crazy way before Bessy started the whole Ghost's thing.It is a good reading, though and I really enjoyed the irony in it!"
3,The Observations,"Interesting, but a little difficult to get used to the writing. My heritage is Irish, so I found the cultural aspects/biases particularly interesting. Anxious for my book club discussion of the book."
5,So Good It Shocked Me,"I LOVED Bessy, the narrator of this novel. What a character! Very gutsy, very outspoken, honest, and to top it all off, she has a sense of humor. The novel itself had an entertaining, mysterious plot. What seems to be irrelevant and unrelated happenings actually ends up being tied together in a bow by the end of the book. It did, however, have a rough beginning. The narration is shoddy and difficult to read at first. The reason is explained at the end and the reader actually realizes how very appropriate it is. In order for the novel to read more like this girl's journal, the writing is much as people spoke back then. But as the girl matures and improves writing wise, the novel blossoms, the texts changes, and becomes easier to read. So those that are put off by the beginning language, do keep going! Bessy's thoughts and observations as she plods thru a difficult life of a maid in the Victorian times will have you laughing out loud as well as shaking your head in sympathy."
3,"The Story was great, but the ending was sloppy.","I loved the story and couldn't put the book down until I was done. As I was reading I keep thinking of all these different things that would happen and even different ways it would end. So with all these ideas running through my head you can imagine how disappointed I was at the ending. It was weird because the rest of the story was great, its almost like she just hurried up and finished it. The ending ruined the whole book for me. Just because the ending was bad I would not suggest it for someone to read. Which is sad because overall its a good story."
5,Jaw Breakers,"My wife is a jaw breakers fanatic...and buying them in bulk makes sense for us. The shipping cost is a little tough, but at least I can get them fairly quickly."
5,Another uprising of a kick a$$ post rock band,If your a fan of metal music and a fan of ambient music with guitars then you'll absolutely go gazookes over this CD. ITs awesome. Rosetta goes down in my book fo SHO!
4,Informative and factual,This is probably the best book I've seen about Nicaragua and the Cold War during the 1980's. I did a research project there for several months and found Kagan's book to be very helpful and very accurate. Too bad it's out of print.
3,"Dated, though still possessed of some worthwhile material","While this text has its usefullness for scholars in the field, those with a more casual interest can find a plethora of more appropriate books covering funerary texts, mummies, religion and ritual, and various other aspects of Egyptian funerary practices. Much of Budge's work is quite dated - his translations certainly are, and so is his summary of Egyptian history. Certainly interesting from a history of the discipline standpoint - Budge provides a good example of the cognitive processes and widely held viewpoints of a mainstream scholar of his generation, and a detailed account of the decipherment of the Rosetta Stone (and thus, hieroglyphs in general). Overall, however, I would recommend a more modern text, especially for those with little or no background in the subject."
4,AN EVERLASTING TITLE FOR YOUR BOOKSHELVES,"Reprinted from the 2nd edition dated to 1925, this book still stands as one of the most concise explanatory introduction to the arid world of funerary Egyptian Archaeology. Although not ""everything"" is touched upon, there are so many detailed comments and references to writings so-long forgotten and missing, that this alone makes this tile a necessary one for any one interested in the subject-matter. It is true that there are more updated - and equally important - ""hand-books"" on the same (such as the one by Dr. J. Spencer, ""Death in Ancient Egypt"" - long out-of-print), but this one has what the others lack. Buy it, you will not repent."
2,Urrghh,"First of all, this is in reference to the MADACY collection of Chaplin shorts, volume 2. This has nothing to do with any Kino or Image DVD that this review will be cross-referenced to. The Kino and Image DVDs are the way to go.Even worse than volume 1, this collection presents a lot of material available in much better quality from other companies. Madacy once again takes lousy copies of old films, transfers them poorly, often without the title cards included, and adds on a slapdash soundtrack of some old, scratchy jazz records from the 40's, often repeating the same record. The final indignity comes with the tape duplication itself - at the lowest speed possible for even lousier quality.The only reason to get this set is that a few of these films are available almost nowhere else. This is like buying moldy fruits and vegetables, because your only alternative is starving. Just because it's all you got doesn't mean it's any good."
4,Wusthof,"I only give ths a 4 star, because I thought at that price it should come in a beautiful display case."
2,Poor Design,"I've had mine for about a year and I'm expecting an end to break off anytime now. When you drive down the interstate, this thing looks like it's frantically trying to fly away. Flexing over an inch on both sides about as quick as it possibly can. I've actually had people in my cab laughing at it waiting for it to break. I do failure analysis for a machinery company, and know the stress risers on this will eventually cause it to break on the outside edge of the mounting bolts. Probably would have already if I didn't live a mile away from work."
2,Poor Quality,"The tip of my knife broke while I was trying to remove the child safety on a Bic lighter. I have no child and I am never around children, therefore it is useless. This is something I have done hundreds of times with other knives. It took a very small amount of force to break the tip off. This knife is cheap and has a nice design. I can only recommend this knife if you plan on never using it for anything. Also, after flicking it out a few times the blade started to get loose. I tightened it with a screw driver and it stayed tight for two flicks. Your money is better spent elsewhere."
5,Beautiful!,Love these! These are surprisingly large and heavy but I think they are beautiful. Glad I purchased them! Excellent purchase.
5,Great,I broke one of our South Beach Palm glasses that we had received as a gift from my son and was so happy to find them on Amazon. My son will never know! jw
3,Recycled,"Made in GER in 2000, Serial# ARMCD-011, Playing Time 66:09In the never-ending saga of re-issues (which I keep entitling ""recycled"") comes this 15-track compilation of UK-based JAPAN.Oddly enough (or, maybe not), there are more ""best of"" compilations from this group than they've made albums!Now, I don't know how much you like and/or know this group. This latest (?) CD contains EXACTLY THE SAME MATERIAL as the 1997 compilation entitled ""The Masters"", but the running order of the tracks has been shuffled (Wow!)So unless your CD player doesn't have a ""shuffle"" feature (or, you don't already have ""The Masters""), this collection of tracks is pointless, unless, of course, you prefer the running order on THIS disc..."
1,dont buy this brand,"i have this product, and it broke twice in 3 yearsfirst time it was in the first 3 months and wouldnt turn on so i sent it back to company under warranty, thier customer service was horrible. now 3 years later to the day, the picture has gone purple and green and no more warranty. it was cheap but i guess you get what you pay for. when investing in a hdtv my advice is dont go cheap or with some brand you never heard of. live and learn."
5,why even read a review? i can only rave about my G4!!,"after owning a powerbook for three years, and using many iMacs at work the G4 has been a revellation for speed and reliability. it never crashes and has only frozen on me a handful of times over the year. i can multi-task like crazy, opening 700 MB of images in photoshop and doing other projects while i wait for them to open. the time saved in allowing me to complete many tasks at once is incredible. i am no longer impatient when working, because of the numerous tasks the G4 can perform at once.the G4 is also very flexible, since i bought mine a little over one year ago i have added a VGA card (in order to have an 'extended desktop') and a second hardrive.it's an awesome tool!!"
3,Great to have the orinal line up,"I only give this album 3 stars as I'm kind of getting tired of live albums and compilations from the band. It is good to have the original line up, Bush was a good singer, but I still prefer Belladona. In response to one of the reviewers on here that said we gave up on bands after they tried something new, hold your tongue. I never gave up on any band unless the just started to progessively get worse. Example Metallica seems to get worse with every album, but I still buy them as they come out hoping that they might put out something good again. Anyways, this album is good for what it is a reforming of a great line up, now if they'd only put out a studio album."
5,One of the best live albums that I've heard.,"The original line-up reunites for a high-energy live show. All of the songs are played with amazing electricity. I prefer listening to these versions of the songs over the originals. The quality is really amazing, and is a great treat to all Anthrax fans. Don't doubt it, buy it."
2,recorded in a bathroom with a cassette recorder?,"This live mix sounds horrible in high end ear buds. It sounds like you're caught in a mush, not a mosh. I love the ""Joe Belladonna era"" Anthrax, but his vocals sound like crap. If it weren't for Scott, Charlie and Frank's solid playing I'd have given this disk 1 star. The song choices are fine, too, although personally I'd have scrapped the Neil Turbin stuff and played ""A Skeleton in the Closet"" and maybe ""Imitation of Life"". I don't know, maybe just save your money and buy the re-mastered ""Among the Living"". THAT sounds awesome and comes with a live DVD. Just my opinion. Take it or leave it."
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED...SENT ME CHEAPER ITEM!,"I also got cheated by Tool Hardware Shop, ordered a sturdy metal wreath hanger and they sent a cheap thin plastic one worth less than 1/3 the price I paid!!! Called Amazon and they were great since all they did was fulfill the order. Amazon said to return it for full refund!However, I also tried contacting Tool Hardware Shop to see if they will correct this mistake, error, rip off? Well, I got NO reply from Tool Hardware Shop and it's been over 3 days waiting. I just noticed they did the SAME bait and switch thing to someone else here too! Once is an innocent error, twice is clearly a scam. Amazon should NOT do business with vendors like this. Don't buy from Tool Hardware Shop!"
1,Not what I ordered.,Instead of a sturdy white metal hanger I got a clear cheap plastic hanger. It is not worth my time returning at this point.
4,"Does the job, slight door interference","Got this for the entry way door from the garage. Worked well, but the top/hanging part is bent at angle such that it's slightly interfering w/ the door frame. A ""flat"" U design would have been better."
4,I loved the selection,"I would of course give it at least a 4 just because of ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" and although i liked the others I thought they could have made a little better of a choise"
1,Should have known better,Purchased 4 in June 2009. They lasted about 6 months then wouldn't hold a charge. Began with one pack and eventually all failed. The original batteries from AT&T lasted over 5 years.
3,Good for the money,"Battery works fine as a replacement except that it is a little loose fitting in the battery compartment. If you set the phone down firmly, you will lose power."
5,Battery works well,I needed a new battery for our Panasonic wireless phone. It seems to be working well as far as holding a charge. The thing that will need to be seen is how long it works in holding the charge. Delivery was quick.
1,Bad Battery = Bad Customer Service,Battery worked for a month. have been trying to get it replaced but bad customer service. cant get them to replace it or refund me. they are going in circles. will never purchase any thing from them again.
3,OK for the price,"For $2.99 the batteries were OK; they lasted 11 months. The original batteries that came with the AT&T phones lasted about 3 years. My original shipment from the seller never came, but when I sent an email they immediately sent a new shipment. So, pretty good service."
5,Place to buy battery,"Great price for an exact duplicate of original battery, which works as well or better than original."
5,Great battery site!,I've been searching for replacement batteries for my cordless phones for quite some time. I was thrilled to find this site and the correct battery. The phones are back in business. Ordering was easy and the shipment came when promised and expected.
1,It's not worthy,"The battery does not hold charge for more than 15 minutes, and seems to be losing charge with time at a astonishing rate. I now need to buy a new set of batteries but from a different provider. My recommendation: DON'T BUY THEM"
5,Great!!,Product was delivered ontime and saved my cordless phones. I could not find replacement batteries util now.
3,Not what I expected....,"This book wasn't as great as I expected it to be. I thought the idea of a book on the combining of spaces would take into account each person's taste & style and show how the two work together. There's a lot of text in this book about how to merge lives and living spaces, but no real visuals on how that happens. They have one sample set of photos that show the couple and photos of their own spaces and then the merging into one. That was great...but the rest of the bok shows photos of the finished final spaces, which are beautiful but don't show visually the separate styles. This is a great book in concept and if you want to read every word you may get the information I am looking for visually."
5,DeLint does it again.,"For those of you who are seeing the citizens of Newford get older, fear not. A new generation is well on its way to taking up the slack. Maxine and Imogene contain many of the qualities that people have fallen in love with in Jilly, Christy, Sophie, and all the rest, but with a new hipness appealing to younger readers. Newford, of course, remains the doorway to the Otherworld. DeLint still manages to keep the different cultural traditions working together, making all the impossible possible and invites us to join in his world, made all the more real by the imperfections and foibles. Cheers, Charles, and I hope to see more of these young ladies, as I am sure they are going to make startling effects on both this world and the Other."
4,Outsiders,"Like most of de Lint's books, this book's theme of tolerence for diversity gets me everytime. When you mix that theme with spunky heroines, childhood invisible friends, ghosts, and very scary things that go bump in the shadows, I'm a goner and figure I'm up for an all night read. I shared this book with a beloved 12 year old niece. Our discussion of the heroine's use of violence against a bully, helped her talk about the bullying at her school."
4,Exciting!!,"Imogene is that bold punk girl I wished I could have been as a teen. She kicks-ass and takes names, even if it's just hanging out with her best friend, Maxine. From Maxine to her mother, all who surround Imogene are fantastic characters; de Lint switches points between Imogene, Maxine, and Adrian easily.This isn't one of those love story YA novels, so that might put some off, but I urge you to try this book on for size. The fact that it's fifteenth in a series doesn't detract from it at all. In fact, I didn't learn about it until I did this review! .. please click link for the full review: (...)"
4,Loved it,"I'm a fan of pretty much everything I've read by de Lint, and The Blue Girl is no exception. His urban fantasy genre is just so amazing--he really makes it seem possible for faeries to exist. The Blue Girl focuses on Imogene-the imaginitive punk, Maxine-the straightlaced smart girl, Adrian-the ghost, and Pelly-the imaginary friend. As usual I fell in love with all of de Lint's characters. I enjoyed the references to other Newford characters as well, because having read several other of de Lint's works I'm familiar with a lot of them. The story itself--about Imogene learning to see the creatures of the faerie world and dealing with some baddies--moved along at a good pace, and the characters reacted very believably to the events in their lives. This book is great for young adults, as well as anyone who loves fantasy or urban fantasy."
5,great!,i read this book at my local library n liked it so much that i decided to buy it. it's a fun book wt some magic and school trouble things..just great
2,No way,"Some people are saying that this is a great book. I say NO WAY. This is a completly boring and pointless book.. Its about this girl who finds a ghost who has a crush on her and he has these fairy friends that want to show Imogene (the girl) that they exist since she doesnt believe her ghost friend that they exist. So the faeries send her weird dreams and she finds her old childhood invisble friend ""Pelly"" to help are. I would surely not recommend this book!Don't waste your money and time on it!"
1,a blue feeling,"this book makes me awfully upset. Not because it evokes any type of emotion, which it absolutely does not, but because it is such a waste. The book has an extremely weak plot, less than one-dimensional characters, and is written like de Lint had to start and finish it in the same day.I say this book makes me upset because I plan on writing a fantasy book in the future and it is an insult even to me, one who has so much less knowledge than fantasy writers do. It gives me such a sense of lost time and thoughtless reading. Thankfully, I borrowed it from a friend. The only feeling this book effects from me is pity for the friend who paid money for it."
1,Item Desciption is not Correct,"The items in this kit are great, however, the item description is not correct. I received a 2 oz. deep cleansing soap in both kits I ordered, not the 3 oz. soap that is described. Everything else was as the description said. I contacted Amazon to fix the order, but they sent me the same exact thing again. Be warned that you may or may not receive what they describe on the site."
2,You don't get everything as they describe,"They shipped real fast, but it's not enough to overcome the fact that the 2 oz color guard spray that I made the order for is really a .45 roll-on stick. Thanks but no thanks"
3,Easy reading and interesting facts,"This book, although full of intersting facts, is very easy to read. It is a general overview of the more popular and historic figures of the civil war. Although this book is fairly well informed, it falls short on some of the backgrounds of the war leaders. The main focus of the book is the time that they spend in the war, there is maybe 2-4 pages in life prior and after the war. This is a good book for a collection and I would recommend it to those who have a new found interest in the civil war. This book is not the cornerstone of anyones collection, but a good reference tool and outline of the main leaders of the civil war."
3,Expected Better Quality,"This nativity was exactly what I was looking for, and I was hesitant paying so much for it ($138) but I figured it would be worth it. It comes with everything pictured: donkey, bull, angel, Joseph, Mary, manger & baby Jesus. To my dismay, when the nativity arrived and I took it out of the box, and I noticed that in the back wall of the piece, you could see where a nail came through it (the nail for the fixture that holds the light's cord to the back). I also wasn't very happy with the paint job on the angel. She looked like she just got into a fight. I've posted pictures of these 2 issues. I love this set, but for the money paid for it, I thought it would've been better quality."
1,Disappointed,"These coasters were portrayed as being of the thirsty stone type when, in fact, they are not.Water sits on top on the coasters and does not absorb.I am disappointed and not happy with this purchase.I believe they were misrepresented."
5,Big surprise...,"I admit. I was hesitant. I loved the book (& the sequels) I also knew the history of the movie. I was saddened when it didn't make it to theatrical release and had resigned myself to never seeing it. When I found the DVD I was resigned to being disappointed when I watched it. Wow! Jeff. I am so impressed! I loved it! If you loved the book, give it a try. If you are a Jeff Bridges fan, it's a must!"
3,Read the book,"When has a movie ever stuck to the true nature of the book? The movie is simply entertainment and Jeff Bridges is always great,I just wish I hadn't read the book first. As for the ""real ending"", I believe Katz did what was truely best for Orson. As he says in the book, he had done everything imaginable to help this dog and did not come by the decision easily. I think he is greatly misrepresented in the movie and that is the worst part of it for me."
3,Not the Jon Katz I have come to know in his writings.,You must look at the comments by Jon Katz on the video or you will be totally confused if you have read Katz like I have. I have read (I think) five books by Katz. He has led me to many new discoveries about my Border Collie and Aussie. I think he is a very good author but the movie was disappointing.
5,WONDERFUL,GREAT QUIET LITTLE STORY ABOUT A MAN AND DOG IN THEIR OWN TIME OF CRISIS AND HOW THEY COME TO HELP ONE ANOTHER. WELL WORTH A LOOK. JEFF BRIDGES IS FUN TO WATCH AS USUAL.
2,"loved the book, let down by the movie","I have read and loved several Jon Katz books on his life with his dogs. This movie really left out too much of the important plot points from the book and just ends up making Jon look like a jerk. In the book, I felt that Jon really loved the dog. In the movie, he came across as more ambivalent."
1,Terrible Representation,"I have seen a lot of movies based on books and many are bad; this one has got to be the worst. I can't believe Jon Katz allowed this to be released. It doesn't tell 1/10 of the story, throws a lot of fake info in there (all the family drama that was never mentioned in his book) and doesn't really even tell a story. The only scene that is the least bit interesting is the beginning, and that also follows the book. Do not waste your money on this boring non-tale."
3,Good as far as it goes; needed more,"This movie runs only 80 minutes and does not quite cover fully the year that Jon Katz spent with the formerly abused dog, Devon, that he is trying to rehabilitate. Jon also has a strained relationship with his wife and daughter, and the daughter barely shows up, wasting the talents of Lauren Ambrose.Jeff Bridges and Lois Smith do a fine job as Jon and a woman who tries to help him heal himself as well as the damaged dog. Still, there could have been much more time devoted to the whole story."
2,If you really love dogs you won't love this movie,"First off the movie itself was just bad...slow moving, no real plot, and felt like it ended in the middle of the story. But on top of it I watched it with a pit in my stomach because anyone who knows anything about dogs could see that Jeff Bridges' character, Jon Katz, didn't know anything about owning a high-energy dog. It was the typical story of an owner getting a dog for selfish reasons and the dog suffering as a result. Plus knowing that this is based on a true story and that in real life Mr. Katz eventually couldn't handle the dog and put him down made it even harder to watch."
3,"Not rated ""G""","Please note that this movie is NOT rated ""G"" and it is full of swear words. Not for the little ones. It is rated PG and probably should be PG13 for the language alone.Otherwise it's a nice movie - a bit slow in parts but a movie that anyone considering a working (herding) breed or even a Sporting breed should watch."
1,Utter [...],"What utter [...] this book is, obviously written simply to cash in on Fuhrman's name recognition. That a police officer calling himself an investigator could TOTALLY ignore (in a book he describes as focusing on the evidence) the numerous written police reports by experienced officers on the scene on the sixth floor of the TSBD right after the shooting of finding a Mauser high-powered rifle, with ""Mauser"" clearly inscribed on the barrel, is an omission of hard, solid evidence that renders this entire book as baloney.Do not waste ANY of your time or money on this worthless tripe."
4,Very solid contribution to the literature,This is a compelling read. Don't be fooled by the large number of negative reviews. The conspiracy nuts always come out of the woodwork to slam any book that debunks their foolish theories.
2,"sad, really","not exactly Mel Ayton-style prostitution, but rather short-sighted: the President of the most powerful nation in the world is murdered and the...unusual Mr Oswald is apprehended. while i have no doubt that he - how should i say? - squeezed off a few (see Don DeLillo's Libra), Oswald was a nexus of *many* influences, both potential and documented. i give the book 2 stars for its ""curiosity"" value..."
1,I represented on of the shooters,"Mark Furman is so far off that it isn't funny. first of all I am a film producer. I had meetings in the 70's with the studio and the famous writer, Who wrote Martin Luther King movie. I story was so right on that everyone was afraid to deal with it. i can give you one name Robert Music an attorney in Los Angles or Orange County. I even had the pawn ticket of Harvey Oswald Rifle. He was a patsy. I'll bet you didn't know that it was a double team and I proved it. I can also prove were the shooter trained."
1,Oswald did not shoot at all,"The notion that a better rifle could have been used doesn't take into consideration the fact that Oswald was framed for the murder. He tested negative for shooting a rifle. He didn't shoot at all. The question isnt; was there another shooter, the question is who were the shooters? As a previous reviewer pointed out, we don't have to believe anything in this case since there is no chain of evidence. The case begins from scratch with Oswald completely innocent. In fact, you can see from one of Groden's films that a Mauser was first found at the scene. Do some independent research from primary sources , please..."
1,"Boy, are people stupid and naive","If it's in print, you'll believe anything. Use your common sense---all the witnesses who saw smoke from the grassy knoll, smelled gunpowder, saw shots coming from the knoll, all the medical evidence witnesses who reported evidence that Kennedy was shot from the front-all this doesn't just go away because of a slick book. To the reviewer below---John Wilkes Booth was the LONE shooter in the Lincoln case, yet there was a CONSPIRACY. In addition, the 11/1/50 attempt on Truman involved TWO shooters=conspiracy. And, finally, Oswald did not act alone (if at all).Ted Peterson"
1,Simple act of fiction,"This book is uniformly praised by ignorant people who want to believe that Lee Oswald did it. Fuhrman saw an opportunity to take their money, and he took it. Good for him. I am sure if there are other opportunities to cash in on his 15 minutes of fame, he will take them too. Who could blame him? We all have to eat!"
1,"The tide has turned: LET THE PROPAGANDA BEGIN, ORWELL IS BACK","I am a healthy 62 years of age and I have noticed one thing: whenever something happens to 'stir the current' in the government, a backlash is guaranteed to occur. Such is the case with the aftermath of Oliver Stone's terrific movie ""JFK""-since then, there has been a steady stream of one-man-did-it books by dubious authors, all rehashing the long-since-discredited Warren Report.Here we have former Detective Mark Fuhrman throwing his dubious hat into the ring, way out of his element, thirsty for money and more book deals. While he does criticize the Warren story, the single bullet theory, and concedes there may have been more than Oswald behind the murder, he paints Oswald as the only shooter: BUNK!do yourself a favor--wait for it to come into the cheap bins, read it for laughs, then move on..."
1,A simpleton's act of stupidity,"Anyone who would write this nonsense which is in complete contradiction to the overwelming facts available surrounding this case is either cognitively impaired , or desperate for money. What a great angle though? Shoot down the WC and Case Closed and hook em on a new twist.Take a little time and read the primary evidence available in this case. And make up your own mind...."
4,A Good Read!,"Got a good laugh from all the negative ""I think the hobos on the Grassy Knoll did it"" reviewers. I've studied all the evidence for many years and appreciated Fuhrman's clear-eyed look at all the evidence. Modern computer recreations all support the lone gunman theory. I agree that Posner's ""Case Closed"" was better, but this is worth reading, as well. Sorry, Mulder!!!"
1,Makes a great skeet-shooting target!,"Yuk, yuk, and triple yuk! What a waste of paper and trees. I did expect more from the bloody glove planter. I begrudgingly have to give him kudos for his Moxley book. This is pure propaganda, poorly written, and terribly edited.Stan Waters"
1,Can we petition Amazon to enact Zero star ratings??,"I wholeheartedly agree with all the other bad reviews: this book is just lame, lame, and lame. Yes, Virginia: there WAS a conspiracy, and all the rhetoric and pontificating by Belin, Moore, Posner, Fuhrman, Bugliosi et al won't change that fact. What made this book so bad is his acknowledgment that there was a plot, yet Oswald was the sole gunman (!). I immediately sold my copy back. Not worth the $."
1,Can Fuhrman even weigh evidence???,"I was so terribly disappointed in this 'book'---can Furhman even weigh evidence? Maybe he did indeed plant the bloody glove at Rockingham after all. Methinks Fuhrman is very suspicious, especially after reading this poor work. Maybe next time."
1,Not What I Expected,"I heard James Galway on my TV Channel for easy listening and loved the song I heard. However, this CD was not easy listening and I was extremely disappointed."
4,a good cord for a medal,"I bought this cord as a subsitute for a gold chain. It works very well, is comfortable, and doesn't pinch the skin.Perfect for the purpose."
1,Not As Advertised,"The kids saw these on TV and HAD to have them. They have been very disappointed and I heard them tell their friend that they ""don't work"" when they we watching the commercial on TV."
3,must have for preschool readers to be...,This is a keeper; definitely read and appreciated by all. The illustrations are excellent and in keeping with the story!
5,Love it!!,"We originally checked this book out at the library-but it was such a big hit we had to buy one of our own! That was a couple of years ago. Even though our now 7 yr. old son reads Magic Tree House and Junie B. Jones, he continues to come back to Alvie on a normal basis. He loves changing his voice for each of the characters-having the text in comic bubbles made it easy for him to see who says what. The pictures are alot of fun. We even had a Mulligatawny night using the recipe in the book!"
5,Just Awesome,The Box Set is an incredile addition to any fans collection of Christy's albums. It truely sheds light on an incredible performer and how he has grown thru his career.
5,"Stevie's excellent follow-up of ""Belladonna""!","Stevie Nicks' second solo album,""Wild Heart"" is one of her best work that I ever heard and I considered one of my five favorite Stevie Nicks CD's I have collected. My favorite songs in the album are ""If Anyone Falls"",""Nothing Really Matters"",""Nightbird,"" and the best songs in the album,the dance beat favorite of mines,""Stand Back"", andthe orchestral ballad,""Beauty And The Beast."" and every song on the CD rocks including Stevie!"
4,From The Heart,"On her first solo album, Bella Donna, Stevie Nicks showed that she could carry the show by herself. On The Wild Heart, she continues her winning ways with an album full of her trademark romantic mysticism. Bella Donna had an underlying country feel, but on The Wild Heart she employs a heavy synthesizer sound. In fact the big hit from the album, ""Stand Back"", was inspired by Prince. The song has a rolling synth sound and one of the strongest vocals of her career. She does another duet with Tom Petty on ""I Will Run To You"". The song isn't as good as their first effort, ""Stop Dragging My Heart Around"", but that song is an all time classic. ""If Anyone Falls"" is a brilliant track and the best song from the album. There are the requisite mystical work including ""Nightbird"", ""Sable On Blond"", ""Gate & Garden"" and the heavily orchestrated ""Beauty & The Beast"". The Wild Heart shows that Bella Donna was no fluke."
2,The tame musician,"""The Wild Heart"" began a familiar pattern in Stevie Nicks's solo career. Take a couple of good singles, in this case ""If Anyone Falls"" and ""Stand Back"" and surround them with a lot of fairly bland filler material. Nicks was a huge star by this time, and it is clear that she had started to lose her edge. There is no comparison to the material on this or any subsequent Nicks solo album and the material she produced for Fleetwood Mac in the 1970s."
2,"Stand back--far below wild, it's docile at best","In Fleetwood Mac, she's the visionary queen of imagistic heartbreak. Solo, she's an arena-rock diva immersed in self-regard. This one proves it. Her songs drone on like tattered fabric held up by fairy-tale lyrics too focused on magical archetypes to realize the emotional core that makes those archetypes so fantastic. ""Stand Back"" is too catchy; attribute that to Prince's synth line. Important lyrics: ""Don't blame it on me, blame it on my wild heart""--well, okay; ""No one knows how I feel/What I say unless you read between my lines""--no s**t."
5,1st album I ever owned,"I got this album for Christmas around the time it was released. ""Belladonna"" would've been my first choice because it had more songs I knew, but the beat-driven ""Stand Back"" had quickly become my favorite song. Now it's years later & not only do I still have the LP, I own the tape & CD too. ""If Anyone Falls"", the poetic ""Nightbird"", and ""Beauty and the Beast"" (a very pretty track complete with orchestral arrangement, neither of which I appreciated at the time) are the other highlights for me. I've never grown fond of the duet Stevie did with Tom Petty on this album (""I Will Run to You"" has always been a drag.) But overall, this one is worth buying and hanging onto."
4,Beauty and the Beast is the best song she's ever done.,"Stevie Nicks, like many of her time (including myself), is spending this lifetime searching and learning. It's not the destination, but the journey. What meaningful songs she provides for us in her journey."
3,Pretty Good but a Bit Dated,Stevie Nicks Has had Her Moments.I Like Some Of Her solo Work But I Love The Fleetwood Mac Stuff More Overall.on this Disc Beauty&The Beast is a Good song as is I will Run to You.But Prince Steals The Show With Stand Back.that Keyboard Groove still Rocks.The Rest is either Filler or Dated.
4,The Wild Heart,"With ""The Wild Heart"" it is evident that Stevie Nicks is every bit as good a singer on her own as she is with the band Fleetwood Mac. Her follow up to the hugely popular ""Bella Donna"" is a near carbon copy of it's predecessor with the same kinds of songs and musical productions. While not as classy as ""Bella Donna"", The Wild Heart is still a good album with lots of radio friendly tracks including the two standouts on the album ""Stand Back"" and ""If Anyone Falls"". Tom Petty records his second duet with Stevie on the haunting ""I Will Run To You"". There are other good offerings too from ""Night Bird"" to one of her best ballads ""Sable on Blond"". Another treat for her fans. Best song on the album: ""Stand Back"", ""If Anyone Falls"" (Tie)"
4,What I meant to say a long time ago.,"I used to have a longer review on here months ago. I recently deleted it. Here's a shorter one. Stevie's one of my absolute favorites. I just love her voice and songwriting. I also like the way she carries herself. She comes across with a gentle, peaceful attitude. Every song on The Wild Heart is is good except ""Nothing Ever Changes"" and ""I Will Run to You"". Also, it's nice to have a real 25-piece orchestra on ""Beauty and the Beast"", and all 25 musicians get their names listed in the credits. Speaking of credits, its always been said that Prince played guitar on ""Stand Back"". According to the credits, however, there are three guitarists listed, but Prince is not one of them. This is one of Stevie's best albums. Check it out!"
4,Serenity: Southern Seas,"The photography is stunning, the music lyrical and the whole effect is like having a wonderful sunset/sunrise by the sea right in your own home - leave the angst outside"
1,Poison to my ears and eyes,"I live on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean in California. This repetitious, unimaginative, poorly shot overblown digital video is a gross insult to the ocean I know and love. Watching this boring and annoying HD video could make one never want to sit and embrace nature and the sea ever again.Added to badly shot and edited videos, the mismatched and ghastly soundtrack multiplexed to this wretched video is so cloying and annoying it is essential to turn the sound off entirely to even watch a minute of it.If you really need to view an video of the Sea in HD for relaxation or meditation, don't buy this DVD. Just watch HD cams of the Sea you, your friends or tourists have shot with their inexpensive digital camcorders. Not only are most any and all amateur camcorder videos better, they won't drive you batty with an inappropriately wretched soundtrack."
3,Not very exciting.....,"Video is fine, but would have done better to have natural sounds rather than the music. Gets old....."
4,1991 was a good year,"This album came out just short of the Grunge assult. There were so many bands that got ""juked"" as a result of the Kurt Cobain erai.e. WAR BABIES, LONDON QUIER BOYS, SLICK TOXIC etc..and it just was not fair! These guy's had a very cool sound mixed with a funky hard drivin' Lenny Kravitz type vocal and decent guitar riffs. I guess the album just came out at the wrong time and as far as I know they did not release a follow up. Too bad for us because I think with a little work these guy's could have done some damage. Give this album a listen, some of these songs still hold up today, especially in a world of Neo, uuhggg!!! [bad] metal!Lord, how I miss 1991..........."
2,I've Read Better,"This book was OK. I like books about people facing real life illnesses, but i found this book sorta boring. I personally like the Lurlene Mcdaniel books, which give much better detail of what it is like to actually like to be in the hospital."
3,"It works for the ""shade tree"" mechanic.",The section on front disc brake repair disassembly of the front wheel drive hubs is explained well in words and pictures. If there is anything negative it's the electrical section - it leaves you asking more questions than it answers.
4,Really good,"This album is excellent. It makes me relax. Her voice is fantastic and the lyrics are very interesting. Great album, very listenable and soft pop."
3,Severely Allergic,"I have a toddler with sensitive skin, so I like to use natural products. I've tried everything, and while this is my favorite scent by far, it gives him itchy skin and a bad rash every time. Each time I hope it wasn't the soap, and every time he itches. If you are prone to sensitive skin, I wouldn't buy this product."
3,"smells nice, bubble don't last that long","i like the smell and the price and the non-toxic composition of this product, but i don't think the bubbles last too long."
4,A valuable addition to my health library,"Anyone who thinks they can learn qi gung from a book should have their head handed to them. Sorry, you need someone live to correct your form to get the best results.That said, this is a good book for people who want a healthier lifestyle. Dr. Lu may be too far out there for most people, but I love an Asian approach to health. The book needs study. It is not an easy read for people who know nothing of martial arts, oriental health techniques or qi gung. The effort is worth it if you can stick to the spirit as well as the letter of the advice. It is deeper than it seems.I think Feed Your Tiger by Hadady is a good complement to this book because it also deals with Chinese energetics but uses simple recipes and an eating plan that can be adapted to any diet."
5,TCM: A Natural Guide to Weight Loss That Lasts,"This book is excellent!!! I have been on a journey looking for a book on general good eating principles. I am not sure why I picked this book because it was mainly targeting weight loss and I do not have a weight problem. However, when I saw it I felt it was the right book for me. This book is about learning to take care of you from the inside out. It is about healing. The weight loss is just the bonus. I highly recommend it for those of you that are looking for answers on why you just don't feel right."
2,acupuncture student trying this,"I bought this book a few years ago. I am currently in acupuncture school, and despite doing regular qi gong (which is what the exercises are) and adopting the diet, I did not lose any weight. I also didn't notice any differences in that qi gong over various other styles of qi gong.I was really, really hoping this book was the answer I had been looking for, but it has turned out to be like every other diet book--something else to sit on my shelf. I am very disappointed that it didn't work, as I'm studying this medicine, get regular acupuncture and herbal treatments. Nothing has helped me lose weight...I don't know what the answer is, but this isn't it for weight loss for me. I love qi gong and think it has many, many benefits, just not a weight loss instant cure.As for the food, I had particular trouble with mornings--fruit and walnuts made me sick, I got headaches every morning...it wasn't a good diet plan for me."
1,"Good, but not realy...","Good, because this is the only book I have met in my life that actually have told me the reason I gain weight and the reason I can never lose weight no matter that I think I do eat healthy food or I exsersise or I walk, or I add a lot of herbs into my diets.Bad because this books says that it is the Qi gong that will make you lose weight not the food. OK, but then why the author puts only 8 pages of exercise? The rest of the 328 pages is all about food and a lot of bla- bla - bla. You can't understand this 10 exercises - which 1 works for what?Also there is too many passages of the book that repeat to make the book bigger probably.I have some serious doubts that the author of the book knows in debth or understands in debth the TCM."
2,weight loss book,THE BOOK SOUNDED LIKE IT MIGHT BE A HEALTHY WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT BUT IT BECAME VERY UNREALISTIC IN DOING.YOU CAN'T LOSE BY ELIMINATING EVERYTHING HEALTHY.NOW I WISH I HADN'T BOUGHT THE BOOK NOT BEING ABLE TO CHECK IT OUT FIRST.THE SELLER WAS FAST IN SHIPPING.
4,Great spoon rest!,Very functional and large enough to hold 3 or more utensils. Polish steel gives it a nice look. Easy to clean and durable as it does not scratch easily.
5,Romantic and Fantastically detailed.,"This book is completely like the TV show with twist and turns on every page, it's is just so lifelike I could picture what was going on in my head being a fan of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman the TV show. With the detail in this book I could see the people walking and talking as it gives you detail to such a degree. I would recommemend this book any fan of Teresa Warfield's writing or to any Dr. Quinn fan to read. If you are lucky anough to get a hold of this book I hope you injoy it as much as I did because I thought it was fantastic. I gave this book a five star rating because of it's detail and story line."
1,not enough of plot to call it a story.,too much of the secondary charactersnot enough drama-tension-anythingSORR
2,She's getting worse at this...,"I liked Teresa Warfield's first book very much. Somehow, it tied in with what I never knew but expected of her childhood based on the television series. The second one ""Bounty Hunter"" was not too bad but it seems as if Teresa Warfield has lost her steam in ""Growing Pains"". It's a boring book (coming from a Dr. Quinn fan) but seeing it did stimulate my desire to grab on to more Dr. Quinn literature. This, I satisfied by reading the scripts I found at the Official DQMW Site and some episode synopses. Would be nice if Teresa or some other author decides to ""translate"" the entire TV series into a few books. That, I'll definitely buy! Still, reading DQMW can't beat watching it. Gee... I really miss that!"
5,Nice napkin holder,"This is a nice napkin holder, looks exactly like on the picture - shiny, sturdy; meets all my expectations, and my other chrome kitchen appliances. I like this product."
5,I'm cookin' for a livin'...,"One of my young ones received this as a gift and when it arrived at work we all just HAD to give it a try. We bake all of our breads from scratch and our crusty loaves surrendered meekly to this blade in two strokes no matter which recipe we attacked...it even sliced our house ""Wonder Bread"" sandwich loaves cleanly! This 9 inch is sooo much more versatile and heftier than the 8 inch ...size really does matter.I'm biased against all Wusthof ""Classic"" knives...I think that they're too light weight and small scaled (the grip is too narrow for me) but...I bought TWO of these for myself 'cause this is the BEST bread knife that I've EVER used although I highly recommend the ""Grand Prix"" line for it's better ""grip"".Biased or not I'm still loadin' dis bad boy up wit tha MAX ...5 mojo*z! HAZAAH!!!"
4,Great bread slicer,This knife is sturdy and sharp. It slices thick crusts and dense breads veryeasily. The whole family who is into bread baking is delighted with this knife.The only question in our minds is would an ofset blade be even better?
4,A Bluegrass Boy Tells His Story,I have read several books on Bill Monroe. In his book Bob Black gives an overview of his life which includes his years prior to playing with Monroe and after including playing with the Whites. The book is interesting because it gives a first hand account of what it was like playing with the father of bluegrass. It gives insight into playing and interacting with him and the bluegrass boys. Black gives a honest account without overly praising Monroe. It is an easy read that will capture the reader's attention from the first chapter.
3,Add this book to your library,"This 1988 book compiled by John D. Woodbridge contains 65 mini biographies of Christian leaders that cover the 2,000 years of Church history from Peter to Billy Graham. Each is written by authors including J.I. Packer and D.A. Carson This is not the type of book you have to read from cover to cover. You can pick and choose depending on what your interested in since each entry is for the most part self contained. I do argue with the inclusion of Soren Kierkeaard in this book. Though my favorite philosopher, he does not deserve to be put in the ranks of Luther,Calvin, and Tyndale;Although not the best book I've ever read,if you are intersted in Christian History and wanta biography of a great Christian leader that will only take a matter of minutes, this is the book to get."
4,"A beauty in form and function, but will the handle slip?","I've owned this knife for several months and am pleased with it -- it certainly is good-looking. The santoku blade is great for chopping veggies -- I think the hollow (Granton) edge is well worth the small increase in price over a flat blade.The only drawback to this knife -- as it is with competitors' steel-handle knives, is that most cooks will not feel as secure holding it, particular if your hands are a little slippery or greasy. It just feels as if it might slip. For that reason, I think the Wusthof Grand Prix version of this knife would be a slightly better choice. But hey, if you have a zillion-dollar kitchen and a zillion knives, this series is the prettiest to display that you'll find anywhere."
3,"Pretty Knife, but the Henckels Pro S was more functional","I have a couple of Santuko Knives. While hands down this is the nicest looking, I have found that the Henckels Pro S Santuko fits better and feels better in my hand. One reviewer mentioned that the Henckels did not have the Hollow Edge like the Wusthof's, but this is incorrect.The Henckels is called: Henckels Pro S 7"" Santoku Knife - Granton Edge."
2,Too many editors,Twenty minutes were indifferently lopped out of this movie by three subsequent editors after the director left the project. That probably accounts for the muddled mess that remains of what might have been a pretty good western.
2,Women: find a different resource,"This book is geared toward men. Aside from the tiny, basic ""if you're a woman be cautious"" warning, the writer consistently assumes the reader is a guy. It's annoying, and renders the book to be of limited value for over half the population."
3,Out of date but still useful,"If you're looking for a short read with add-on value, then this book is for you. It has more depth than what you will find in a Fodor's or Lonely Planet. Part of the book tries to appeal to expats moving their families to Thailand, which is a mistake because you just can't cover the complexities of that chore in a small paperback.Unfortunately, the book IS out of date. While originally published in the early 80s, it looks more like the early 70s. If I were the author, I would make a serious attempt at revamping the whole thing. I felt like I was reading an old National Geographic."
2,Not exactly accurate info,"I read a few pages and was just shocked. Suggested behavior in cultural quiz would leave you act like a rude ignorance foreigner in Thailand. Yes the author provides enough explanation of the culture in very detail manner but the suggestion of how you do certain things like not replying ""wai"" to the waitress is not exactly what you want to do."
3,Contents Questionable?,"I found this book very interesting but every time I ask my Thai wife about something inside she looks at me like I'm crazy. I've yet to find a case where contents apply to what I observe with her, her friends, and in my travels in Thailand. In short I stopped reading the book.It seems the book was written sometime ago, and I have the feeling maybe it applied 20 years ago but not today? I am not sure you can use this to assist your travels or your interactions with the Thai, but it may be a great way to get an understanding of where they came from culturally. It is also possible, as I do get the impression that there are significant differences culturally between different regions in thailand, that it just doesn't apply wel to the people of North Eastern Thailand."
4,Good Introductory Information!,"I bought this book because I have moved to Thailand for one year... the information in it is spot-on, and it's a good overview to a lot of the social rules that can help you to avoid making too many faux pas! I gave it only 4 stars because I found the ""doing business in Thailand"" section to be mostly geared toward ""the expat manager"", which I certainly am not. I would have appreciated more general information on workplace participation, but without the assumption that the reader of the book will be the person in-charge of the workplace (I am an international volunteer! So, low on the totem pole). Still, for coverage of religious rules and the BIG taboos like feet/head and jaai rawn/jaai yen... it gives plenty of coverage."
2,Out of date info.,I read this book having been in Thailand a few weeks. I some of the info out of date and not in touch with modern Thailand as it is today. Suggest readers look at more current titles to gain an ingisht into living in this country.
3,Just OK,"I don't know the race of the author, but in my opinion, it seems to be written from the perspective of a white, American business man. Perhaps this was intentional for the sake of marketing, but I found it difficult to relate to. A appreciate the ""realists"" perspective, and found some helpful information, but I would not recommend this book to my friends."
5,softest hat!,Love this hat! weather is 10 degrees & this hat is cuddly soft & extremely warm. I 'm going to buy 5 more.
4,"Great toy, but cheaply made","This car is a great fun, my kids love it, but it is cheaply made. We've had it for 4 days, the stickers started coming off and the paint as well..."
4,Cute!,My nephew loves all of the shake n go cars and this one is no exception! My only complaint is that they ship it with the switch on so the batteries died as soon as I received it. Otherwise great!
4,Safety Harness,"I was impressed with this product, strong, durable material with adjustable buckles & rings for attaching safety snaps. Very affordable price, should last a lifetime."
5,Great for an intorduction to music,I would recommend to teachers and music instructors who wish to introduce students to classical music. It tells a story and introduces the different sections of orchestral instruments. It also explains these instruments and how they sound.
2,They changed the ending of the story.,"I love ""Peter and the Wolf"" and have heard many versions of it in my life- it is truly a classic. I thought this would be the best version I heard since I also like David Bowie, but it was a real disappointment. Bowie apparently decided that it would be more humane for the Wolf if he put it in the zoo! That wasn't very good for the Duck, either. It's funny but the composer, Prokofiev, was once criticized for changing the end of Romeo and Juliet in his ballet- allowing them to live after taking the poison. Now, Bowie has changed Prokofiev's ending to this terrific children's story- in a way, I supposed it's fair play."
3,"""Defective"" Nutcracker Tracks","The narration of Peter and the Wolf by David Bowie is fantastic. That is why I ordered the product. I am a music teacher, and want to use this with my young students. However, the Nutcracker tracks are all cut short--each is missing the last several seconds of the recording. Why include this music if you are going to butcher it by cutting it short? If there was not enough time on the CD to include it all, just leave it off! What a waste!"
1,"I don't mean to be Rude, But...","Simon: I don't mean to be Rude, But... you suck at writing. You cannot be a writer in a million years. You should stick to what you do that is business and leave writing to someone else."
5,The Greatest book ever!!,"I am always bored of every book, except this one...this is the only book i would read...the brutal honesty, his story, his way of being, make this book unique and one of its kind...and if you cant handle the truth about ur choice for an ""american idol"" that is expressed in this man's own words, then ur stupidness and ur ignorence will affect u for the rest of ur life...in other words, then...U SUX!!"
2,"Horrible, bloody horrible..","First of all, Simon probably didn't write the book, it was most likely ghost written.Secondly, it was a short read, not worth the price. He makes himself out to be the best thing living on this planet which I suppose is part of his public ""persona"", but it gets tiresome after reading it, ego on every page.Thirdly, He would have been better sticking to gossip from the American Idols. I would think that would have done much better. The fact that he wrote about it candidly and without as much ego as the rest of the book earns it that extra star.Do yourself a favor, and just watch American Idol. Simon is funny on TV, but just an ego maniac in the book."
1,horrible,horrible! Absolutely horrible! Everything about it was horrible!I prefer reading this book with my eyes closed.
1,A rating for Simon...!! :-),"Stir clear,this book is all drawn out.Its boring and lacks lustre and reveals nothing valuable.Its poorly written and too long.If you've watched Pop or American Idol,then you've seen it all:- 0 out of 10..."
3,A good book for a lengthy plane ride,"Okay, I admit it, I'm a huge fan of American Idol and I have eagerly awaited its return each time.I also have to admit I enjoy most of Cowell's snarks and think without him the show would fall flat. Having said that I think the book is defintely not as good as the show but worth reading. It's rather quick and easy to read - a good book perhaps if you're on a long plane trip because you'll probably finish it before you land.Some parts of the book are very interesting - such as Cowell's tale about the networks that turned AI down, the fact he warns all up and coming stars never to turn down a handshake or autograph seeker because those are the people who will buy their products and support them and the ""true"" story behind Brian Dunkleman's departure from the show.Other parts about the mothers of the contestants hitting on him and Trenyce's alleged three-way made me roll my eyes and didn't add much credibility to Cowell - even if they are true."
3,Interesting!,"I watched AI and I have to say this about Simon ..I like him and I hate all at the same time (now how can that possible!)He is funny and interesting man, but he would be someone I prefer to stay away from..LOL!"
3,For the fans,"It's definitely a book for the fans but it has its flaws. First of all, the repeated references to strip clubs were tiring. And Simon wrote 2 very LONG paragraphs asserting his heterosexuality. OK, Simon, we got it. You're straight. Not that there's anything wrong with that (ha ha).Kidding aside, I'll give Simon some credit for at least discussing the rumors...As for the overall book, it was a fun read. I got it for Christmas and started reading it while watching World Idol."
3,One read wonder,"Yes, I admit it; I watch American Idol, so when I saw that Simon Cowell, one of the judges on the show had written a book...well, I decided to read it.Now, it has absolutely no redeeming value to anyone other than a fan of the show, but as such, it was entertaining enough to me. In the book, Simon spends the first third talking about who he is, and how he got there. The remainder of the book is basically his thoughts about the first two seasons of American Idol. Like I said, nothing of interest if you don't watch the show.Would I read it again? Nah, but I don't feel like I wasted my time reading it once."
3,A curious book,"This is a very different book for someone who prefers murder mysteries, although I did enjoy it. As a foodie I appreciated the references to gourmet food, and was intrigued by the parallel story as told by Faulkner. Other readers may find it more rewarding than I did."
2,Overly long and off point,"The central premise is not bad, but the movie just keeps repeating the same point over and over. It would have been better if they had skipped the ""global warming"" segment. The argument against globalization is very week."
4,A good mystery story,"This is the first Robin Light mystery I have read, but it will not be my last. It is not a deep book, and is fast and easy to read. It keep my interest by having surprising facts turn up throughout the book, right up to the end. With my last child, a daughter!, going off to college in the fall, and having visited Syracuse University often, this book truly gave me the something to think about late at night."
4,Think twice before sending your baby off to college!!,"Never been to Syracuse University, never even been to Syracuse, NY. Does it matter? No. Vanishing Act, by Barbara Block, sent shivers down my spine and made me rethink my own college days. SU student Melissa Hayes is missing, local and campus police are clueless, suspects abound and only Robin Light can help poor Ms. Hayes' family through the ordeal. Through a series of twists and turns, Robin pulls teeth to get the information some people would rather she not find. Peril, suspense, and a not-so-typical ending leads you to think back to those bygone days at school, and ponder the supposed care-free moments and the loss of youthful innocence."
5,"Review for ""The Palgrave Concise Historical Atlas of Eastern Europe: Revised and Updated""",I liked this book. It allowed me to get a visual representation into the history of Eastern Europe as I learned about it in my college class. Being able to put visual aids together with lecture notes greatly increases my understanding of material. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in knowing more about Eastern European history and the role it's played in the world.
1,Very bad movie,This movie shouldn't even have the Silent Night Deadly Night storyline. It had nothing to do with it and was extremely slow and I was bored throughout the whole thing. I recommend Silent Night 1 and Silent Night 2 over this.
1,"Boring and stupid,a waste of time,money,and film","SN,Dn was a classic horror flick and the second one was a alright black comedy but this pathetic trash is the worst of the series next to that horrendous part 4.The so-called plot deals with a blind woman with ESP that knows who Ricky is going to kill next but when Ricky escapes the typical murders begin.This one is less bloodier than 1 and 2 but still awful.Just another waste of good celluloid on a stupid movie.Stick with part 1,2,and 5 and avoid part 3 and 4."
2,BAD,I BOUGHT THIS AT A MOVIE SALE I ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE THE ORGINAL THE CASE LOOKED COOL BUT I WATCHED IN UTTER SHOCKNOT SCARED KIND I DIDNT KNOW WHY PEOPLE THOUGHT THEACTING IN MOVIES IS BAD IT ALL SEEMED THE SAME TO MEBUT BAD ACTING AND NOW ONE HELPED WHEN SOMEONE WAS ATTACKED AND THE GIRLS COULDNT EVEN SCREAMRIGHT
3,Booda dome liners,"These liners are great, if you own the original Booda dome. I own the one with steps, so these don't fit. Not even close. I guess it's my fault for not doing enough research, but it would have been nice if there had been an explanation about the difference in sizes of Booda domes, and the difference in types. They're inexpensive, and (almost) fit the trash cans in my bathroom, so I consider it an even loss. DO YOUR RESEARCH. I get 2 stars; the liners get 4."
2,Light is very spoty and bright,This is the worst product that Canon has ever made. Light is very spoty and bright and it does not get power from hot pad.
1,No better than a flashlight,"Sorry, Canon, this is the worst product you ever made.First, the head does not tilt at all so you are unable to bounce the light for a softer effect. The amount of light it gives is not controllable at all. It has only one setting, which is ""flashlight bright.""Those two factors mixed together, it gives the same look as a deer in the headlights. It drowns out all natural colors and makes any shot you use it for look like a bad documentary.I've owned this flash for over 3 years and my advice to my videographer is to use it, ""only when you absolutely have to"". Literally, you may as well attach a flashlight to your camcorder. You'll get the same results."
5,Digital Cameras,Can anyone tell me if this light can fit in the shoe for the digital cameras like the T2i or the 7D???? I'm under the impression the shoe harness on cameras and camcorders are universal.
5,"No battery included, but it isn't hard to find...","This light was made as an accessory to Canon's Pro line of cameras. It uses the same batteries as the XL1, XL2, GL1, Gl2, and a number of other cameras. It is assumed that if you are buying this light that you already have such a camera and have spare batteries, too. (What kind of videographer only has one battery anyway?).The light also comes with instructions that clearly list the models of batteries that work with it. Buying Canon original batteries/chargers is difficult/expensive, but there are plenty of cheap aftermarket batteries/chargers available for reasonable prices. This is a great video light when you can find it for a decent price."
3,Will blind everyone.,"bought it after great reviews, ive had the chance to use it many times. It works flawlessly, but my only complaint is a big one, it is way to bright.... so bright that ive had party goes avoid getting in front of the camera because of the brightness blinding their eyes...... never a good thing to happen to a videographer in the wedding business. I've searched around for a diffuser and cant find one anywhere..... ive resorted to using this unit only when its a must! I'll admit it makes for a great flash light for when the power goes out.... yes i have used it as that. Im about to buy another light for my second camcorder, and sadly i will avoid this one..... I will search for a smaller light that has a diffuser, this will keep the bride from squinting her eyes in every shoot."
2,Canon VL-10Li II Video Light for Canon Camcorders,I found the product to be disappointing. The illumination is not nearly what I had expected. The only positive is that it is elevated high enough above the wide angle len.
3,A fine debut mystery set in the Denver area...,"Michael Allegretto's debut novel ""Death on the Rocks"" is a suspenceful mystery that is a bit too brief, but manages to capture Denver and nearby Golden, Colo. well. Here, Jake Lomax, a tough ex-cop turned P.I after his wife's murder, looks into what looks like fatal car accident on a mountain, but then Jake finds that the dead man hid a destructive secret that could have caused his death. Just when it looks like the story is over, Jake has to rescue the dead man's wife and young daughter from the psychotic biker villian. Very thrilling, and seemy enough"
4,Good story,"This was a strong, adventurous mystery. He writes with a lot of cynical flair. Several good one-liners, and a pulsing chase scene at the end. The killer's identity isn't a huge surprise, but doesn't seem meant to be. The emphasis is on the characters and the setting. Nicely done!"
5,Love these Rags,Great album. Enjoying them all and introducing a budding pianest about a form of music he wasn't familiar with. Highly recommend.Scott Joplin ~ Greatest Hits
3,Joplin should not sound like Gershwin!,"Levine plays the best he can to intend approach the essential spirit of the Rag. But he lacks of that special rapture in the expression and plays extremely over polished without those little imperfections and disaffections involved in the this genre.The Rag is -in certain harmonies- a sadness that, being incapable to cry, smiles."
5,Great intsturment,"I bought this set for my baby and her friends. They all enjoyed it very much. It's held up very well, hasn't cracked. The sound it makes is great. I was very happy with the product."
4,Fascinating to watch how my 7-month old plays,"This is great for grabing, moving, eating, rythm, holding, stretching, rolling for my 7-month old. It seems during each stage of his development there's something for him to incorporate this into!"
3,Misprint on page 152,"It says on that page ""It's got nothing to you with you"". I think the sentence was supposed to read ""It's got nothing to do with you"". Also, on page 144 there is a reference to a real life man named Frank Garner. There was a fictional character on Dark Shadows by that name. Interesting!"
3,"Fixed blower problem, but modification may be required","It seems that GM has done some ""standardization"" with their blower motor resistors, so this unit will plug right into some vehicles, but mine required modification of the blower housing. It was fairly easy to do with a utility knife and very sharp blade, but also left opportunity for ""over-cutting"" and then you would really be screwed. I don't blame Amazon for this, I blame GM. Just a heads-up to potential buyers. (mine is a 2004 Chevy Express G1500 5.3L RWD 8-pass)"
5,Fun Read,"I just finished re-reading the book again for the umpteenth time. As always it was a great read, I really enjoy the Flinx series in the common wealth. Flinx is such an interesting character to watch develop. Just a note as to the comments below that the author is not going to be writing any more Flinx novels, that is untrue. Another one will be out latter this year(2000), or early next (It is titled Reunion)."
3,More like Foster in flux,"This book is the start of what I call the Foster money crank phase. It seems all of his books written with the Pip & Flinx characters from this book on are template books; take a successful character and stamp out books, dragging it out as long as you can."
2,Not my favorite,I read the other books in the Flinx series years ago and enjoyed them. This one was only fair-to-middlin'.The characters seems wooden and two-dimensional. The plot line was predictable and didn't seem to have much content. The emotional communication portion was overdone and a fairly tedious. There just wasn't a lot there.Perhaps it's just my tastes have changed...I'll have to go re-read Tar-Aiym and Mother Not to see...but this one just seemed a bit pro forma.
5,magnificent MacDonald,"Received my copy of San Francisco and other Jeanette MacDonald Favorites very quickly and was very pleased with the CD. Sound was crisp and clear. Amazing, considering most of the recordings were made in 1950. The earlier recordings from 1939 and even earlier were also clear. Although I am not fond of the singing style used in the San Francisco song,(I think my father would have catagorized it as 'caterwalling') you have to give Jeanette credit for being spunky and brave enough to try out this music style. Maybe when I've heard it fifty more times I will even come to like it. I certainly like the other 21 selections."
3,"'Open Air Burg Herzburg,Volume 2' - Various Artists(Think Progressive)","Not as good as the first release,'Wir Sind Kinder Der Revolte,Volume 1'.'Open Air...' features one track each from seven different artists that played at the annual German hippie music festival in summer,1999.A couple of really good cuts here include Ashra's(aka Ash Ra Temple)eighteen-minute ""Twelve Samples"" and the Hypnotix eleven-minute piece ""Roots"".Top of the line WHAT many might refer to as new age/world music.Very good.The Dissidenten tune ""Instinctive Traveler"" hit me sort of like a Gong wanna be.Tunes here from Sunya Beat,Edgar Broughton,Caravan and Might As Well are so-so."
5,Drake's best work.,"This is Drake's best work, and that's saying a lot.It's the Norse Myths -- the Prose Edda that he read while spending time in Iceland -- translated by Drake into the language of Science Fiction.And this level of translation is more difficult and more valuable than simply casting it into modern English. In this 'translation', Thor isn't a big long-haired blond guy who talks funny. He's an ex-cop called Nils Hansen who's very good with a gun, and who will never get used to the idea that he has become a god.These books have the best Odin (Colonel North), the best Loki (North's android son Fortin), and the best Thor (Commissioner Nils Hansen) that have been written in seven hundred years.I have read them five or six times over the years since they were new, and I sure wish I could take a pill that would make me forget all about them so I could read them for the first time again."
4,Solid Asian horror flick,"Like a lot of the other reviewers, I'm a big fan of Asian horror of all kinds--I had overlooked this modest little film until now, but it was reasonably entertaining and, despite the occasional silliness, has a cohesive plot and some good effects. (There's a very brief moment when the shadow of a passing coffin falls over a young woman's face, which then contorts into the most terrifying expression I've ever seen. I don't know if it was CGI or not, but it's *really* creepy.)It's not exactly non-stop terror and the young heroine's cluelessness occasionally gets irritating, but I still found it preferable to some of the earlier j- and k-horror movies that suffer from disjointed plots and ridiculous inconsistencies. Stylistically, it's much closer to the Pang brothers' Eye movies."
1,"Could have been better but falls flat, very flat","This movie suffers from creativity. It does try to by incorporating some Chinese superstitions but it never really materializes and falls back to the typical, overused ""murderer"" plots without much to it. If only the scriptwriters developed the screenplay around the Chinese superstition, it would have been better.For a movie that is based LOSELY on Chinese superstitions, try Feng Shui (Philippine horror) though I must warn that the execution and acting is quite bad but the concept behind it is quite unique."
4,dont want to be a maid,"saw the movie over the weekend and it was a pretty good movie. Had some scenes that will make you jump and some good plot twists. Overall, I would recommend this film."
1,Smells like old lady perfume,"I had this product recommended to me by a friend, but the smell of old lady perfume is overwhelming. I can't get the smell off of my hands after 10 washings. We had to turn on the fan to try to air out the room. I would not recommend this product."
1,lasted 5 seconds,"My husband has a landscaping business, though he already has multiple pipe extractors of other brands from irrigation supply stores, he bought this pipe extractor because of the 3/4"" feature which is a great idea when you're dealing with limited headroom. Unfortunately the top broke off after the first turn. This hasn't ever happened before with any other pipe extractor he's used before. If you're looking to remove a pipe that you'll have to use any muscle loosening you should probably look elsewhere, just wanted to warn everyone"
3,Gave it a try.,I have been haveing issues with my nipples for years so I figured I would give this product a try. I found that it worked great for a couple of weeks and then it became extremely difficult to continue use. The rash and irratation became too much to tolerate. It is just easier to buy a set of jumper cables and a battery charger. Trust that works much better!
3,What the...!,"Saw this. Checked it out. I don't EVEN want to know who the h@ll invented it or how they thought of the concept.CIA torture device?Cosmetic necessity?Joke?Holy nipple-twister, Batman!"
5,Worth the wait.,"Although I had kept my Vinyl copy in pristine condition for many many years, I kept waiting for Silver morning to come out on CD for portable reasons...worth the wait...one of the most under rated pieces of music ever.Timeless and his interpretations of songs like Blackbird hold up today as they did 30+ years ago. NEVER EVER tire of this album!PS Every lady I have ever played this for love the romantic ""feel"" of this music. RIP Kenny. Tim Boman Salt lake City 2010"
3,no palms,Certainly seems authoritative. Lots of information. A nice reference. Plenty of photos. - but:- it does not include Palmae.- the three-page identification section is mostly a list of questions but usually no indication of what to do with the answers.
2,"Tedious, confusing, not one of her better books","It took me a long time to finish this book. I have zipped through her other books, this one I was tempted to leave unfinished. I kept waiting to find out who? Why? etc. and then when I did, I went, no I don't think so. I am still unclear on a lot of the acts of violence and the motivation of all the characters and how they mesh and synch together. The fact that so many things are left unexplained for me is the reason I only gave 2 stars. I will read the new books in the series and hope for the best! The potential is definitely there."
4,enjoyable,I have just read this book. I have read others that were written after this. I have enjoyed them all. I find Goldie believable and likeable. All the characters in the books are believable. It is a good read
4,I like it,I enjoy Diane Mott Davidson books when I'm coming off a book that is intense. She makes me laugh and her books are a quick read. I've read them all.
3,Good read-really 3 1/2 STARS,"I've actually started reading the Goldy Bear Culinary Series in order, which is unusual for me, so this is my third, and so far my favorite. The characters, town and overall setting really come together. Major personality development with Julian and Arch, which is very satisfying and offers some humor. Less mean old ex-husband which is a nice change and the set up for more between Goldy and Tom will keep fans coming back for more in this series.The only disappointment is the premise for the mystery is a bit far fetched -- who in their right mind would leave their kid in an ""exclusive"" prep school after 2 murders? Because the author writes this with humor and a bit tongue and cheek, most will get by this litle snag."
2,She lost me with this one....,"I'm reading Mott-Davidson's books in the order they were published.I like Goldy and her quirky son Arch -- and I like Schultz and Julian and Marla, but I felt this story line was weak and not too carefully thought out. And, frankly, I got a bit weary of those Aspen Meadow pushy, pretentious, preppy parents. They made me nauseous.I've started the next one and hope it will satisfy as much as one of Goldy's fabulous catered affairs."
3,Great recipes! 3 Star Story!,"This is one of Diane Mott Davidson's series of culinary mysteries with Goldy the caterer. This one deals with the murder of the valedictorian of the prep school. Goldy discovers him when she is packing up the catering van after a college information night/event. The story focus is on the pressure of getting into the ""right"" college. The pressure is on the students, their parents and the administrators and teachers. The question is, who will sink to any level to achieve what they believe they deserve. While the storyline was a bit stark for me, the recipes were excellent. The Chinese Beef stir fry, the Biscotti, Red n Whites, and the Galaxy Doughnuts were just a few of the excellent choices. Some of her other books that I really enjoyed were, Main Corpse and Prime Cut, and then Tough Cookie."
3,"[AUDIOBOOK VERSION] i liked the mystery, bored with the 'men problems'-angle.","still, i definitely cared enough about 'whodunit' to listen to the end.the other thing that held my interest, was the reader. barbara rosenblat is *excellent*. if you get a chance to let her read you a book on cd or mp3, do not pass it up! (i know she's well-known, but this is the first time i'd found her.)"
3,Add a start if you enjoy cookbooks!,"Diane Mott Davidson writes a fast moving book and the addition of recipes and descriptions of her preparations as a caterer are fascinating for an aspiring gormet. However, the prep school parents vying to get their kids into Ivy League schools portrayed in the book were not only annoying but completely unrealistic. The dialogue was often absurb and Goldy the caterer would have lost many a job by her smart alleck comments that she made to her clients. The ending was unconvincing and I found the frequent references to her physically abusive physician ex-husband (""the jerk"") annoying. His character had nothing to do with the story line - why did she include him?I found the book frustrating because it could have been so much better. Mott maintains the suspense, featuring a caterer as a main character is interesting and the recipes are good! (I tried some.)"
3,Not nearly as good as the rest of the series,"I love the Goldy Schulz series, but this book was off the mark from the start. Who would kill the valedictorian of a prep class? Frankly, I didn't buy the ending, and found the characters in Cereal Muders not distinctive enough; I got some of them confused. And while Goldy is usually a pretty smart cookie, she makes some really stupid decisions in this book. Usually Davidson's characters are engaging, but I found the preppy parents in this book obnoxious and annoying."
5,Magnificent movie,"i just happened to be watching Link tv and the movie ""daughter of Keltoum"" was showing. The story, acting and plot is very good. I especially enjoyed the way the movie ended."
1,Don't waste your time.,"I have sent back two of these fixtures. They arrived in their original packaging, a thin box, not suitable for shipping. Holes were torn in both, and the fixture was battered. I counted at least six dents in the first. The second fixture had the end smashed in, and a small dent in the middle.Bottom line is, they can't get a quality fixture to your door. Perhaps, by the time you read this review, Amazon or Maxim will start double boxing. Until they do, don't waste your time or money.Home Depot isn't close to me, but I ended up going out of my way to find that they have an equivalent Hampton Bay fixture that was cheaper ($30 at HD, vs $45 for this at Amazon), and was made of a heavier gauge metal."
3,"Not bad, but not great, either.","I am a Wagner fan and an Ormandy fan, but this combination just doesn't click. It is not bad, but everything on it has been done better by someone else. I think Ormandy was too well-adjusted to play Wagner well.So, I guess I would recommend it as an introduction, as there is a good variety here. And, it is pretty reasonable."
3,Good intro to Wagner,"I only knew one or two of Wagner's compositions. I never knew he wrote the ""wedding march"" till I listened to this CD. This collection expanded my knowledge of Wagner a little bit but I'm still looking for a better collection of his music."
2,"Good guide for sightseeing, but NOT for hotels, restaurants","While this book provides fairly accurate guidance regarding natural features and campgrounds, don't use it a reliable guide to travel necessities that are market driven like hotels, restaurants, admission costs, etc. Each time we used the book to choose a hotel, we were surprised and sadly disappointed in either the quality, the cost, or both. The same for recommended restaurants. Admission costs were generally 20% higher than listed. No big deal, but again, for a current publication it fell short in accuracy. It's as if an earlier printing was simply published as current without checking on the accuracy of the contents.Use it as a guide, but not as a reference. I'm sure there are other sources of more accurate information for travelers."
3,Good deal for the price I paid.,"This book was not in the best condition, but it was a good deal for the price I paid for it. My biggest complaints are that I had to buy a used copy because the book is out of print and I accidentally ordered the wrong edition. Neither of these things were the fault of Amazon or the company that sold the book through Amazon. I would definitely order from this company again."
3,No Good for Small-Handed People,"While this brand of spica splint works just fine for my husband (tendonitis from keyboard/mouse usage), it is an awkward fit for me. Admittedly, I have very small hands and wrists, but my thumb doesn't come close to the end of this brace. The loose fit around the thumb renders the support ineffective for my DeQuervain's tendon issues. Additionally, the stretchy material at the back of the wrist has to be doubled over under the velcro in order to close tighly enough, making an uncomfortable lump.I have a spica splint for my left wrist by Ossur (Ossur Form Fit Spica Splint Left X-Small), which fits much more comfortably. It is nearly identical except that the metal splint is thinner and the overall construction is smaller. I recommend it for small-handed people. As a pianist, it is worth the extra few bucks to get something that really works."
4,Pretty big,"I bought this splint for trigger thumb. It is well made, with plent of adjustment but it is big. It seems like it would be great for a wrist injury. It does work for a thumb but it could be smaller. The adjustment for the thumb is minimal leaving the thumb with too much room for movement. I wrapped a piece of an Ace bandage around the thumb before putting the splint on and it works well like that."
2,It's HUGE,"The brace would definitely work for my issue, however it was so huge I had to return it. My thumb wasn't anywhere close to sticking out like the picture shows."
2,ORDER OF THUMB SPLINT,This order took way way too long to get to me. I ordered it as I had an issue with my thumb and tendonitis. I eventually had to go running around to different stores and finally found one. Then a little over a week later it arrived.Product is the same as the one I bought. The service was what was lousy.
2,Beautiful...until,"I loved the way these knives looked when I bought them last year. They are gorgeous...but a few months ago the ""W"" logos on the handles started falling off! The knives have only been hand washed. Apparently the logos are glued on, very cheap. Disappointed."
5,Great Workout,"I Love this video. I used Ana's Beginners Mat Workout Video for several years, but needed to upgrade to a DVD when I started traveling for work (to play on laptop). It is really great. I would suggest starting with the beginner's mat workout video, to get familiar with some of the moves a little more. I haven't listened to the CD yet, but hope to get that on my MP3 player so I can finish my workout at the gym with some pilates."
3,Good for basic Pilates,"Not quite as strenuous as I needed, but a good place for a beginner to start. Not sure how it will produce weight loss due to brevity and lack of challenge."
3,It's decent,"Other than the fact that Ana Caban's former job must have been wearing the Barney suit and entertaining young children (she's a little too peppy), I think this workout is decent. It's pretty quick (30 min) and not too challenging, but if you do it everyday I'm sure you'll see some improvement in the ab and leg area. I was also a little disappointed to see that she doesn't incorporate weights in the workout. I'll probably order another Pilates DVD soon hosted by someone else."
3,Basically the same exercises as another DVD I am using,"This DVD is probably OK, but decided to use another one I purchased instead. The background music is somewhat annoying at 5:15 am when we exercise."
4,Bitsy,"I ordered this DVD last Thursday and it arrived at my home by Monday. Overall I think it's a great workout.I ordered this DVD as well as Pilates for Weight Loss with Karen Garcia, and my only dissapointment would be that this DVD is one of the exact same workout that Karen Garcia does. But, on Karen Garcia's workout you can choose Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced level with about 5 different workouts in each section.This DVD is only 30 minutes and the other has about 3 hours of different workout's you could do.Don't get me wrong, I do like this one! But for the money I would say to order the one by Karen Garcia because you get more for your money, and more workouts!This one is still part of my collection and I plan to keep it in alternation with the other Pilates DVD's I have, especially if I don't have much time to fit my workout in.Not a bad buy! It's overall a good one..just has the EXACT same workout that you can find on the one with Karen Garcia."
5,Remarkable,"Timm and Dini are the masters and this book further proves it!Sometines scary, sometimes racy but just plain fun."
1,A bad parody to Dieter Bohlen productions,".If you want to listen to a good music, then you should buy originals - not THIS !!!."
5,Excellent knife for roasts and poultry,"If you frequently carve roasts or poultry, and have some extra money lying around, then this is the knife for you. Although not quite as sharp as the Shun Stainless slicing knife, the Wusthof Culinar carving knife is better balanced than the Shun Stainless or the Henckels Twin Select, and it is sharper than the Henckels. Although some might find this knife pricey given that it may not get used as much as a cook's knife or a santoku knife, neither of those will carve meat as easily as this knife. I have tried carving a turkey with a cook's knife, and it just is not a good idea. The stainless handle may be slippery for some to use, but I find it more comfortable to use than the handles on the Wusthof Classic and Grand Prix knives. With all said, this is a great knife that has encouraged me to buy more roasts and whole poultry by its ease of use."
4,I admire her!,"I thought I ordered the book, but I got the DVD. Having said that I really enjoyed it. I will in the future buy the book to get the most out of it."
5,I Have One For Each Of My Six Kids,"My mother gave me a copy of this book for my first child born in 1994. I am a little picky about things such as baby books and I loved this one. The illustrations are darling. The pages have little quotes and drawings in the corners. The author gives some pages with specific things to write about and many empty pages for whatever you want. I have just received my sixth copy for my last child. I love this book. I still pull out my now twelve year old's book and read it. It has congratulation cards, birthday cards, his first teeth, locks of hair, his birth announcement, and those of his siblings stuck into it,- yet there is still a little space to write a little something more."
3,Baby Love: A Keepsake from the Heart and Home,"This is a very pretty book, and probably has the most categories to fill in of any baby book I perused (which, for busy professionals, can be a bit daunting ...) There were two things that made me decide to send it back and to keep, instead, the book produced by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (A Baby Book for You). (Reasons that are peculiar to me, I might add, and not a reflection on the quality of the book.) First, the book is small in size. In my mind's eye, a baby book should be larger. Second, the watercolor illustrations are so faint that it frankly is hard to see them. An additional minus, in my view, is that the author's name is on the cover of the book. (This is true of the book by Linda Spivey, as well.) To me, a baby book's cover should not take ""credit"" away from the true authors of the book: parents and child."
1,Boo,"We'll definitely be returning this one.Although I've really enjoyed Susan Branch's beautiful illustrations and calligraphy in the past, her drawings of babies are completely unappealing. Many of them are frankly scary-looking! Who wants that in a baby book?Also, I read the Maryland Parent's review before buying the book, where s/he mentions that the illustrations are sometimes too faint to see. I figured that book must be misprinted copy or something, but mine is the same way. I have 20/20 vision, and I struggled to make out a bunch of the pictures. (...which, in light of the aforementioned homely baby issue, maybe was a blessing in disguise.)Save your money!"
3,Well...,"The problem I find with this book is it focuses on trying to explain rumors by twisting facts into ficton-a problem I found when reading many Evita bios. I feel there definitely needs to be a better bio written for the market. The book on the whole was interesting for me as a first time reader of LudwigII.However, the author tends to overlook important issues ie.I was really disappointed when we are told Ludwig toured the western region of Bavaria, but instead of finding out about what he did on the tour(in reflecting his FACTUAL actions),we are drawn back to what Wagner was doing and his importance in Lud's life.Good for first time read but I have read better."
1,Wrong DVD,"I ordered two copies of the movie ""The Birds"" by Alfred Hitchcock and recieved 2 dvds of Birds which is a documentary. After returning the dvd's and requesting the correct order I was told that my money had been refunded and I woulkd need to reorder the right movie. this was not my mistake and I am losing faith in amazon's sellers."
1,David Heavener is no Harrison Ford.,"I rented this video because the title reminded me of one of my favorite films, THE FUGITIVE, but I was very disappointed. The story is about this guy (Heavener himself) who is injected with this tracking device and he is hunted down by these killers as a group of rich gamblers bet on when and if he will be killed. It sounds like an interesting story, and it may have worked if the direction and acting had been better, but David Heavener is no Harrison Ford and he doesn't have the talent to pull it off. I'd have to give it a thumbs down."
3,OPEN SEASON,"In this outrageously contrived film, David Heavner wrote, directed and stars as a yuppie computer nerd who is targeted as the prey in some rich man's game. How the prey is chosen is never clarified, and how it can be conducted is rather incredible. People sitting around betting on whether someone will be killed or not is a hard scenario to swallow. The action scenes are redundant, and Heavener is not the world's most talented actor. Being able to claim star/director/producer status doesn't ensure quality.Joining Heavener: Richard Norton as the son of the man responsible for the game; Lynn Holly Johnson with her usual ebullient smile as Heavener's ex-wife; William Windom hamming it up as Heavener's Uncle Billy.A passable timewaster."
3,the other bridge,"Ignore the 3 rating: I honestly can't rate this movie cos I've never seen it but for those who care, yes, there is another Water Under the Bridge: With Judy Davis, David Cameron, Robyn Nevin. Australian Mini Series 9 x 1 hour episodes made for TV 1980. Based on Sumner Locke Elliott's novel about life in Sudney 1932-1948 and produced by Shotten Productions. Personally, if anyone can provide a copy I would LOVE to know about it - it was brillo."
5,Works great,I didn't realize when Best Buy sold me a low profile mount for my flat panel tv that there would not be room for the RCA jacks on the back of the tv. My tv was tilted away from the wall because it was resting on the cords. These 90 degree adapters fit perfectly. TV picture is still great and now my tv can sit flat against the wall.
5,You've found it.,"If you're looking for an adapter to reduce the depth of a component with RCA connectors, I'd say you've found what you're looking for.Excellent quality and materials, I'm quite confident this'll be the only set I'll ever need.Solid connection while still easy to remove.Caveat - should be sold in pairs...I ordered two and got lucky, receiving one with a BLACK (as shown in the picture) band at the base of the male end and the second adapter (fortunately) came with a RED band.Not a big deal, but helpful to maintain channel (Left/Right) orientation."
5,good solution,Allows monitors with straight-in RCA connectors to use low profile monitor mounts. A great solution for a really dumb problem!
1,Tray wont open after a while,"I bought 2 of these units. After about a year, both of the trays no longer open. I have to use a paper clip every time now..."
2,Crapped out early,"Bought this in January of 2008. A little on the loud side, but burned relatively quick, and was a nice companion to my original factory installed DVD burner. Then in about August it started making random coasters, and now it will not even read any DVDs at all, much less burn one. My system says the drive is there, no problems are seen, but any inserted DVDs cannot be read. Even tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Mine turned out to junk. Your mileage may vary. Good luck, I see that others had no problems."
2,Canned Churchill,"Here they are! The most famous speeches of the great Prime Minister, providing ""the roar"" of the British Lion in 1940 and beyond. The words are all there, spoken by the Great Man himself - but, alas, with one or two exceptions, these are not the original speeches, delivered in the House of Commons, or live, in radio address. This is Churchill, at some later time, reading his speeches, in a recording studio, and what is missing is the electricity, the immediacy, the humor, the charisma of the Man in the Moment, not to mention the very real reactions he drew from his audiences. Well, it's better than nothing - the words are still magnificent - but better to find recordings of the originals, as delivered, live and unedited."
5,Superb oration and use of language. Very inspiring.,"This is an abridged collection of some of Churchill's greatest speeches. I have listened to this CD numerous times and after every listen I am inspired, motivated, and reminded of the great art of oration. Churhill truly had a gift for sculpting language and history into an art form.An excellent abridged collection of timeless oratory from a true leader."
1,Nicely presented poorly delivered,"I was looking for a family yoga session and instead of it being like a class with beginner warm up poses, and then progressing through a whole session, it is a series of examples of what you could do with your child but it jumps all over from very complicated advanced poses for someone who has practiced yoga a long time to something simple. It is not a class with a clearly defined set of poses for various length workouts. That is what I was looking for. The people are moms but don't seem to think about attention spans of various age children. The DVD is professionally made with appropriate studio quality."
1,Thanks Mr Funk,"Thanks to Stephen Funk of Chicago (in case any readers think Mr Glass has turned funky). I probably have 90% of Philip Glass cd output. Of that 90%, about 80% gives me great listening pleasure. Sadly this cd does not fall into the listening pleasure category. Like Mr Funk, the soprano grates and irritates. To be honest I gave up after listening to the first two movements and switched to the bonus cd with Ginsberg reciting his poetry. Oh dear! Sorry, Mr Ginsberg, as you fly around with the angels I have to say that speaking verse was not your strength. So I was going to give the cd to my son to sell on ebay and make some pocket money. Then I read Mr Funk's review and, on his advice, gave the first 8 minutes of third movement a listen. Yes, good Glass music. But the rest is a big disappointment. There is much better Philip Glass music out there in the world for your listening pleasure. Well, you can't win 'em all I guess..."
2,The weakest of the symphonies,"I'm not a fan of opera so that's why I don't hold this symphony in high regard. The singer's voice is beautiful but an hour of it is too much and destroys whatever is left. I'm already hard of hearing but it's nearly impossible for to appreciate the music while the singer is warbling to her heart's content. Except for the intense first 8 minutes of the third movement where the music has a sense of Glassian urgency that begs your attention, I can't listen to any of it. Again, I'm not a fan of opera. When you're losing your hearing, you want what you do hear to make sense and opera doesn't translate for me. I'll defer to those who review this symphony with 5 stars and who understand and appreciate opera. But, I prefer Glass' instrumental music and this symphony simply doesn't have enough."
2,Nice Cinematography...Underwhelming Experience,"I bought this disc because it was shot in Hi-Definition (HD) - not film, which makes it one of the first theatrical releases shot in HD...The look is excellent and the camerawork is nice. The acting is pretty good too. But it plods fairly and there doesn't seem to be much of a story or an experience for the viewer to share.Fairly laidback story. Not extremely gripping. That's about it..."
4,Entertaining,"Even if this movie is not scary in the least, it's still entertaining to watch. The little doll house looks nothing like the real Amityville and all of the things that happen in this movie are totally unrelated to the original movies but it was still funny and entertaining at times"
3,Why so much $$$$,Just wondering why this movie is so hard to find all of a sudden and why a new copy on DVD is $130-$150??
3,amityville dollhouse,"the acting was the only thing that kept the movie intact. i thought the whole bee in the shed thing was pretty corny, but i liked the topless girl and the masturbation scene."
3,Amityville Dollhouse,"Amityville Dollhouse is the most recent in a long-line of sequels to 1979's The Amityville Horror, which was based on a true story. Unlike many of the sequels to ""The Amityville Horror"", Amityville Dollhouse is actually pretty good!A man builds a new home for his family,on a previously occupied lot. The old shed is left over. He discovers an old dollhouse in the shed, and gives it to his daughter for her birthday. Once the dollhouse enters the home,mysterious incidents begin to happen.Eventually the family realizes that the dollhouse is what is causing their misfortunes. Amityville dollhouse is the best sequel to The Amityville Horror."
3,Amityville.....the saga continues,"I enjoyed this movie, though I think the writers have gotton away from the possibility that the original film was supossedly based on a true story. This movie is not realistic, which I like horror to be. Nonetheless, it's a good watch, and not too scary at all.GOD BLESS YOU!"
3,Weak but fairly entertaining,"This has NO connection to the previous Amityville films except the dollhouse looks like the Amityville house. We don't know how this is or why the dollhouse shows up in these people's shed. The film is fairly entertaining. The oldest son is an interesting character. The dollhouse itself just isn't scary but the ""ghost"" of the geeky little boy's father IS VERY disgusting to look at, and somewhat frightening as he exhorts the young boy to KILL. The aunt and uncle are a highlight, as is the scene where the teen boy's girlfriend is horribly burned, very creepy. Its not that great but its ok to watch once."
1,Shame on Me!!!!,"I don't blame the movie as much as I blame me for watching this stuff knowing that it isn't going to be any good and then getting mad because it was as bad as I thought it was going to be. The whole series has been very minor as far as a horror series are concerned. So even though this is WOW BAD , I'm keeping it going by watching , OH SHAME ON ME!!! LOL!!"
2,Rediculously stupid...thank God it's the last one!,"This question keeps hammering away at the back of my mind: Why, oh wy, did they have to make sequels to the classic AMITYVILLE HORROR? They really have milked this whole franchise over the years! This one is just so incredibly rediculous...all I have to say is just don't see it!"
4,The Horror of a lifetime,"I have seen this movie, and i loved everyminute of it. There are lots of scary parts on it. I lovded when that little boy, looked out the window and saw his dead father standing beside his grave. He came into the boys room, he told him to kill his brother and that his son had fogotten ity. I would have gave this movie a 5 star, if he didnt die so easily. But if you like horror, this one is for you"
2,"Okay, but kinda boring","This was pretty good, but only has a few ""scary scenes."" The only part I liked was when a big, giant rabbit almost eats the bratty girl. But for the rest, it's dull."
2,Fumblin in Dublin,"In my humble opinion, this is a pretty dull book of criticism. Vendler's clear personal affection for Heaney--revealed by her familiar biographical detail and history teaching alongside the poet at Harvard--doesn't so much bias her critical approach as much as limit the reach of her inquiry.She's made up her mind so neatly, boxed her topoi up so tightly, that these essays feel more like a hermetic prescription than a platform from which to launch interesting criticism and discourse. One gets the feeling that a critic with more distance from her subject might produce fresher, more engaging criticism.Heaney's stunning work and Vendler's accomplished scholarship have both seen better settings."
1,Not that god,"I dont really recommend this , i bought it thinking it was interviews with Nsync , but its just a person telling you about how they started and stuff . The only part were u actually hear Nsync is the national press conference , but even then that only goes for 4 mins .byez"
4,Great Toffee,"I love this toffee, Ruth's makes it really well. I prefer toffee with fewer almonds, most of the rest of them, the almonds overpower the toffee flavor. Like another reviewer stated, the toffee is easy to eat, not too hard. I highly recommend this product.12/20/2012 UpdateIt is now 12/20. I placed my order on Dec. 7th and the order has not arrived. This toffee is a tradition with my family and I am hoping it will come on time. I wrote a message to the seller but did not get any response. Very Disappointing."
2,first review,"This was one of the most redundant and prosaic books about physics I ever read. I felt like it was a grand waste of time, and had a hard time forgiving myself for reading it. The word ""capricious"" in the title may lure you in thinking that you're in for an adventure or a surprise, but there are none. The jacket says he is a composer as well, and I hope his music is better than his writing, but I doubt this man has any true creativity to add to the world."
3,Hit-and-miss,"This is more ""straight"" than most Godard films. It resembles the type of biting satire that another filmmaker might make; it's strange, but not as quirky and abstract as his other films tend to be. Herein, we watch a couple of country bumpkins go and fight in the King's army, commit various atrocities, and come home with the bounty they've earned (a briefcase full of postcards).But, it's no great shakes. It seems based around a treatise that war is bad, because the masses are being exploited. There is no acknowledgement that war is sometimes reasonable or necessary, in the face of aggression. It's just the same old ""the ruling classes are bad, and here are some glimpses of abject ugliness presented as proof"" that was in vogue during the 60's and 70's.Extremely dated, with a few clever and/or memorable moments. Points up for the attached commentary track (on the DVD) during which a critic who admires Godard's work tells us what he sees the film as being about."
5,Ancient grief returns from lifetimes ago to heal.,"Can the pain of death be so horrific that it returns from past lifetimes to teach us to heal? Carol Gino and her fantastic Italian family find that just this happens in Then An Angel Came. When the death of a child steals over the Gino's in the dark of night, a darkness of such depth threatens to still the beating hearts of the living. Carol and her daughter search for answers and find them in the realms of another world. The answers and the healing come crashing in upon them like the waves of an angry ocean. But it is the healing and cleansing of those very waves that bring the family to a point of karmic renewal most of us only dream of finding. For anyone who has ever loved anything and lost it, Then An Angel Came takes you through a journey of death and grief all to familiar and then into a cathartic promise of healing. Worth every tear, this book is a must read!"
3,"Royal treatment, standard fare","A likeable late-80s country crossover album with few surprises. Often redeemed by Royal's pleasant vocals, the tone of the album seems typical of the decade. One delightful note is the duet with Donna Fargo ""Members Only""."
3,"Bought it in 1990, still listen toit today","""I'll Pin a Note On Your Pillow"", ""Out of Sight and on my Mind"", ""She Don't Cry Like She Used To"". These alone are worth the CD, although there are a few other lesser known gems here.For reference, I like Atlanta (impossible to find on CD), Mason-Dixon, Asleep At The Wheel as choices as well."
2,Nothing Super-minty Found Within This Product,"This is false advertising in my opinion nor a great value. The mints themselves come within a thin plastic cartridge which can easily slide into a wallet. Tiny mints smaller than expected which actually resemble tablets smaller than a split pea. Found myself placing 4 into my mouth hoping to experience the ""Extra Strong"" and it just never happened. Disappointing product for someone seeking that extra strong mint."
1,Yikes,"Yikes, what else do I need to say...except that the author needs to improve on grammar. Also some of the rhymes don't make sense. My kid is not a flower, a kitten or a gracious smile. Please give up all efforts to write or publish. END IT!"
5,LIFE ENHANCING and PROPHETIC,Truly an amazing and uplifting read that brings wonderful insights and golden nuggets to the (oft ellusive) heart and soul of our shared humanity...Ron Flemming touches the innermost core of our being and illuminates our brilliant qualities while also exploring our darker secrets. I Loved this excellent read and highly recommend it to people of all creeds and color! What a Great Gift to all readers...Many Thanks
5,A Beacon of Hope,"Like that Bright, Shining Star in the night above... Heartbeats radiates with an abundance of Encouraging Love and Profound Vision. Offering Up the True Joys of Faith, Hope, and Charity to all readers as it Lifts our often weary hearts and Lightens our Eternal Spirits. What a Wonderful Gift to help us along life's twisting paths and winding voyages. So very Insightful and Inspiring! A Golden Ray of Sunshine... Thanks Be Mates!"
3,Fourth in series..starts to show contunity,"""The Naked Liar"" is the 4th Wilcox novel. The time setting is early 1930s, about a year after the previous novel ""Missing Moon"". We see many characters from that novel here, as Carl is hired to prove that an attractive, but ditzy woman didn't smother her lying, cheating husband. At first, Carl is skeptical, but then after meeting the woman's sister, Rita, he begins to believe that she is innocent. Then, two thuggish gangsters appear, wanting a stash of jewelry that Bernie( the Naker Liar/dead guy of the title) had on him. Soon, suspiction falls on the poker buddies and the stranger that brought to the last one before Bernie died. With a noirish feel at times, you can guess that justice is not eaxctly done, but some bad guys get what is coming to them. Good, solid novel."
5,Super Catchy Music,"I might be in the younger range of this album's audience (30), but I've been a Johnny Mercer and Bobby Darin fan since I first heard ""Mac The Knife"" and Louis Armstrong cover Mercer's ""I Wonder"" when I was a 15.Personally, this album is the epitome of what a duet should be. The melodies are spot on ear worms you won't stop humming, the delivery and tone playful but always committed. The energy they share is always complementary, never outshining the other.This must be in your collection , no matter what."
3,Unremarkable,I was expecting more from Trevor Eve and the rest of this cast. The plot was predictable and characters unexciting. I generally love British TV and movies but this series was just ho hum.
4,3rd review!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Trevor never disappoints on screen. See him in waking the dead series...There is nine seasons of entertainmentWith English subtitles for the hearing impaired
3,Why would you bring a whole lot of money to a gun fight,"I dont understand why the star insists on bringing alot of money and no weapon to pick up a kidnap victim, who captors have automatic weapons. I hope it gets better, right now I wish they would shoot the lead actor, very dull."
4,Crossings is enjoyable,I enjoyed Crossings for the most part. It could be a little slow at some parts and the story was pretty standard sci fi but the relationships - especially Buffy and Dawn's relationship after their mom's death - were explored well. I would recommened this to someone who has a few hours to relax and wants a quick read.
3,A Help At Times,I thought this would help when you have lotion or soap bottles that are almost empty. It does help at times and washes up pretty easily in hot water. Some of the larger bottles do not sit tight in the top though and still have to be balanced against a wall.
3,"Come on, it wasn't THAT bad","I've just read some of the less charitable reader reviews for Dust. All of them point to the book's didactism and woden characterizations as its ultimate failing. Yes, the science is over-wrought, and yes, the characters are as flat as my shadow. BUT, no one reads Pellegrino for those things. We read him for the unique way in which he makes real and unusual science relevant to everday life. Dust certainly does that. This ain't Hemmingway, people, but more like Scientific American packaged more readably as a novel."
4,You though it was an asteroid!!,"When you listen to an audiobook you want a reader that captures the essence of the work and adds to it. Jay O. Sanders is the man!! Thought provoking storyline, terrific beginning, interesting subject spacing and jaw dropping ending. I love a good extinction yarn that goes against the prevailing theories. Hey, currently we have frogs that are malformed across the globe, birds showing up with weird beaks, abnornal glacial melting....it could add up to DUST."
4,You'll Never Look at an Ant the Same Way Again!!,"This book kept me up reading till 2AM. Then I went in and checked my kids, to be sure ""everything is all right"" with our world. I found this book very scary. I'll never look at a lowly ant the same way again. The way all of nature is related is something I never really thought about before. And the chain of events in this book shows how when one species fails, it affects another and so on and so on..... Could have been edited down some but overall a very good, scary read."
3,Scary thriller straight out of todays headlines.,"DUST, a cautionary tale of what would happen if the world's ecosystem would totally break down. The premise of this novel is that the mass extinctions that occur throughout the past on a regular basis are caused not by massive extraterrestrial events such as meteors but are instead caused by a natural cycle of life which includes massive population explosions by various forms of life. This is an interesting novel but I warn you that it is also highly depessing because almost everyone in it dies. I know I enjoyed this book and I am sure you will too, but one word of caution you will never think of dustmites in quite the same way again."
3,Great Science - Weak story,Some great scientific theory mixed with weak characters and story. However it is recommended reading for the ideas put forward.One question: Wouldn't it be possible to outrun a 'mote'?
2,Dust is a bust.,"The cover and author's name caught my eye in a bookstore. Having read Pellegrino's excellent ""Her Name, Titanic,"" I looked forward to reading ""Dust."" I bought it without a second thought. Mistake! The book is filled with wooden characters, repetitious dialogue and every ridiculous clichÃ© imaginable. Badly in need of editing and shortening. I find it impossible to read this book for any length of time. I already read three others while ""Dust"" collected dust on my bookshelf. This is a book that tempts me to skip whole chapters...the only problem is I am afraid to miss an important twist in the plot. Too late do I realize I did not miss a thing and should have skipped the chapters. I still haven't finished it...maybe I will, maybe I won't. Perhaps I will wait for the movie (if they make one), rent it and fast forward to the end. ""Dust"" is a bust."
2,Pretentious and didactic,Yet another end of the millenium apocalyptic novel which is characterized by excessive didactic science explanations and 2-dimensional characters. The book also includes a pompous afterword section - an exercise in over-justification. I have to admit an interesting scientific premise is developed (for a SF novel) but spoilt in the execution by rather clumsy writing. Perhaps the author should stick to the non-fiction science genre.
1,Might want to skip these Mites,"High hopes for this novel, I love an end of the world scenario especially when it has creepy crawlies and natural occuring disasters. It didnt hook me, mostly because of its slow narrative and uninteresting characters. The mites, or motes, and vampire bats and whatever else came up wasnt scary at all, the cover says ""scarier than jaws"" and thats a clear misnomer. I stopped reading at page 149, quite enough to get a feel for where it was going."
1,How did this book get published?,"Terrible writing, stock characters, scientific paranoia - don't publishers employ editors anymore? I finally gave up about the middle of the book after reading the fourth gee whiz exposition of dinosaur die-offs before Alvarez's comet. Send this guy back to the lab! (Hey Amazon, why can't we choose zero stars?)"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This man cannot write. I only finished the book because I paid good money for it, which I regret having done. I expected a thrilling, fast-paced, realistic view of an ecological disaster and instead found a novel by a man in dire need of talent, some writing classes, and a decent editor."
3,Not one of the better end-of-world novels,"This book had a very interesting premise. Something causes the insect population of the world to virtually disappear. This causes a chain reaction whereby other species that were dependent on those insects start to die off and other species that were kept in check by those insects start to attack humans. Crops start to fail, et al. A group of scientists are studying the problem and trying to come up with ways to repopulate the insects (mostly through cloning) before man is wiped out from the face of the Earth.Unfortunately, the story itself is not so exciting. This was one of the most boring end-of-the-world stories I have ever read. The characters seem to be too one dimensional and as uninteresting as they could possibly be. As such I found myself skipping over a lot of sections so I could just get to the ending and move on (the only thing that held me was to find out how man ultimately righted the world or disappeared)."
2,More is Less,"`Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in Ice' Pellegrino says it will end in a plague of mites, no wait, bats, no, fungus, wait, wait, how about, nuclear war? No? A comet?Apocalyptic stories succeed and fail on 2 things. 1. An emotional connection to those in peril. Which Pellegrino FAILS to deliver.And 2. An interesting, frightening, overwhelming `antagonist'. To say that Pellegrino takes the opposite approach would be doing a disservice to the word `opposite'. The mites, fungus, bats all are just symptoms.... Of another symptom, of... well we never learn what causes it all. That's right, a end-of-the-world story that doesn't tell you why the world ended.And while were on the subject of the world ending, does it? What happens to Europe, Asia, Africa, the rest of America? Pellegrino doesn't know, and neither will you. So its got that going for it too."
4,This would be a fantastic movie!,"This is one of the best science fiction books I've read. It's a page turner. I hate bugs but I've known for quite awhile that they have a place on the earth (but I still wonder about mosquitoes). Civilization falls apart pretty quick in this story.There is some offbeat humor I appreciate. Lets just say I'm not a Sinatra fan either but I think the guy in this book takes his dislike too far.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because he tried to hard to explain the science behind it all too much. After all, it's a novel, not a textbook. I understood it but had to re-read it and think about it. Then again, maybe that's a good thing."
3,Good Read - But not a Lucifers Hammer,"This is an okay disaster novel, but I didn't think the rationale for the disapearance of the bugs was plausible - or even very interesting. But he has some fun in this book and most readers will too."
3,Variation on a theme - but still good.,"I enjoyed this book. It's not a great book; but it is enjoyable. If you like end of the world fiction, this holds its own with others in the genre. The classics of course being: On the Beach, Alas Babylon, Lucifer's Hammer, etc. A good read - recommended."
4,Earth on Edge,"A very chilling view of humanity's place in the universe...the bottom line is the Earth is not in danger, the ecology is not in danger, but humanity is in danger when the balance of nature is upset. What disturbed me in this tale though, is the idea that all our interference with the ecology had nothing to do with the insects dying off and the resulting plagues--it was just a regular blip. A blip that by all rights we really shouldn't be able to fix. As a result, there was too much going on in this book to give it five stars. But, I got the message, enjoyed ""Dust"" immensely and I'm searching for more books by this author. Also, this vegetarian just rescued a tiny ant in my kitchen and sent her outside--intact! My world view has evolved a little more, thanks to ""Dust."""
3,Snowballing plot based on the scientifically possible,"This book started out kind of slow and uninteresting at first. I debated on continuing with the rest of the novel. But, once more of the foundation for this horrifying chain of events took place it became much more believable and enjoyable. Having interest as well as a bit of knowledge about scientific principles relating to the environment helped keep my interest as well. I was continually waiting to see what part of the earth's ecological web he was going to use next. I would reccomend this book to people who have an interest in ecology and to the ""end of the world"" buffs."
1,terrible writing,"The premise of this book is excellent and I started reading it with great anticipation, but I quickly was greatly annoyed by the author's style of telling you events instead of showing them through narrative. Soon I was disgusted by his lack of any exposition of what was supposed to be happening. I gave up after struggling through half of it. It has been several months since I tried to read it and I forget many of the details but the memory of his poor writing remains. I consigned the book to the trash can where it belongs."
3,"Intriguing Premise, But Lacks a Payoff","This book started out with much promise, but fizzled on the delivery. There was too much discussion on the cause of the environmental catastrophes and not enough action for me. The ending was lacking in impact."
2,"Pompous, preachy, an un-thrilling thriller","A tedious examination of a totally implasible scenario resulting in the end of ""life as we know it"". Uninteresting characters spend endless pages discussing the philosophical and metaphysical reasons behind and implications of an occurrance that would certainly destroy the planet's current eco-system, but just could never happen. In addition, in the afterward, Pellegrino reiterates the urban legend regarding the death of Dr. Charles Drew, and claims it true. His poor fact checking further undermines any credibilty the science in this book may have ever had."
3,"Okay; not great, but okay","The fact that the author quotes as truth the hackneyed and quite disproven urban legend about Dr. Charles Drew's death (supposedly he, the black man who made blood transfusions possible, died because a white hospital would not admit him after a car wreck and he bled to death) makes me wonder about some of his other premises. I agree that the characterizations are very weak and the people part of the book was uninteresting. But most of the scenerio is plausible and it's refreshing that someone else sees that while humans may not last, the world will keep right on ticking. Not worth reading twice, but maybe worth reading once."
2,"interesting premise; poor writing, weakly-drawn characters","I was extremely disappointed in this book. While the premise is interesting and plausible, the characters are not. The writing is ""jumpy"" and difficult to follow. An important criterion of a good novel is that the characters must become ""real"" for the reader; and, for me, there wasn't a single character in this book who did. I am an avid reader who enjoys a variety of fiction and non-fiction, and I appreciate a good book of ""Dust""'s genre. Unfortunately, this one just doesn't make the cut. I almost never give up on a book before finishing it, but I almost did this time."
1,Send this guy to writers' camp!,"How did this book get published? The plot is convoluted and jerky, the characters unreal and stereotypic, and the science exposition apocalyptic and arrogant. Even the premise is tired: humanity destroyed by ecological carelessness. Ho hum. Also repetitive. I only made it to the middle of the book - gave up after reading Pelligrino's fourth exposition of how dinosaur die-off preceded Alvarez's comet."
2,Kid's Typing Game,"I had this game for my daughter back in the '90's. It is a very educational game and promotes teaching kids how to type. However, when I recently bought another copy for my grandchildren I could not get it to download properly on an XP or Windows 7 machine. I'm sure there may be a way to make this work but I could not find it. I would caution against ordering this unless you really know a great deal about formatting and computer programs OR you have an older (I mean Ancient, we're talking Windows 3.1 or 95) machine to put it on. It worked great on an old school Mac before Mac's were cool again, circa 1994."
3,Robert Plant - 'Now & Zen' (Atlantic),"This Robert Plant solo CD was good when it first came out in 1988, but is it just me? Has any one else ever considered that after those two Page & Plant reunion tours and CD releases we got in the later '90's that most of Plant's solo works were like more or less a conciliation record? Don't get me wrong, 'Now & Zen' is okay - just nothing to get all that excited about. Tunes I can still get some enjoyment out of are ""Heaven Knows"", the awesome middle age rocker ""Tall Cool One"" and ""Billy's Revenge"". Personally, I think ""Ship Of Fools"" is simply one of those all too many over-played songs that I'm burned out on. A decent catalog pick."
1,Awful. 80s period for this dude is questionable at best.,I finally have dug into Plant's oeuvre and I can't say this is much of anything to write about. 80s production and a really grating sound in general. I would stay away from this stuff as it's pretty damn bad. Same with the previous album Shaken.... Just really awkward and terribly dated stuff imo.
4,Superior Pop Record from Bona Fide Rock Legend Plant,"Now and Zen is a solid Pop/Rock album from beginning to end. Even the filler tracks are catchy, fun and interesting. The production and recording have that clean, crisp 80s sound. Nicely done."
4,why remaster a digital recording ?,"This is a great recording. Perhaps even one of Plants best. It also sounds great. I don't have this version, I have the original release. The original release is an all digital recording ""DDD"". So why I ask would there be a need to remaster? If you already own it you will not need to upgrade. Beware of marketing, Remastered...my *^%!"
1,Annoying,"No one can say that I didn't try. I've attempted to like this album - I've listened to it three times, but I just can't like it. The music is grating; Plant's voice sounds thin; the songs are forgettable. As is often the case, the work of the individual musician hardly ever lives up to the music produced by the parent band. Talent will get you far, but the ""magic"" of the lineup will take you to the musical heights that all aspiring rockers seek. Robert Plant's work is a prime example of a gifted vocalist throwing away his talents on 80's garbage."
4,Solid 1988 pop-rock.,"Sounds like some people think well produced is bad. Not me. The whole cd does have that (good kind) of late eighties polished-ness to it. Most songs are very catchy either in a rock way, or a couple almost in a new-age way. If I remember correctly, this is a good headphones cd too. I would say this might not be quite as good as ""The Principle of moments"", but better than ""Fate of nations"". Someday Plant will put out a ""Best of"" and solve the dilemma. Until then this cd is good enough that after 15 years I still listen to it now and zen."
3,Good but not great !,"There is some good tracks on this one, but I think that ealier solo material was better than this. This one won't make history.""Ship of fools"" is great for sure, ""Heaven Knows"" is not bad also, but we are light years from the rocking gems of the seventies !"
1,From Awesome Heavy Rock to AOR Schlock !,The late 80's were a horrendous period in this Hall-of-Famer's career. This is kind of where Plant was heading on the final Led Zep album but the other members kept him in check. Luckily he redeemed himself with Manic Nivana a couple years later.
2,Where a brilliant direction went astray,"Robert Plant's first 3 post-Zep solo releases were brilliant pieces that showed he could accept his legendary status, put it behind him, and move on. The albums were very mature, and it seemed as if he were telling people to quit thinking about LZ and ""listen to THIS"". This fourth CD, unfortunately, initiates his slide back into his own legend, even using samples of LZ tunes on some tracks and using Jimmy Page on another... just a warm-up for the commercialized releases and reunions that were to follow. The only tracks I can recommend are ""The Way I Feel"" and ""Ship of Fools"". Several years after this was released, I saw him on David Letterman, hair grown back out, covered in beads and bracelets. The end had arrived, and I don't see how he can ever recover."
4,Beginners look into Amish lifestyle,"Amish Values ""Wisdom that Works"" is a good general overview and introduction on basic principles of the Amish life. Ruth Seitz ""plainly"" explains 10 values that are guidelines for the Amish. The photography by Blair Seitz is fantastic, capturing the realness, happiness and contentment in daily life.Cherry Stone"
3,Just OK- Amish Peace by Fisher is Way Better,This book doesn't tell you much. It's mostly pics. Try Amish Peace by Suzanne Woods Fisher. It's a great resource for learning how we can implement simple Amish wisdom into our daily lives.
4,mickey mouse sprinkles,I sprinkled these over the cupcakes and everyone thought it was a great touch. Loved it.
5,WDW Sprinkles,These sprinkles are the same as what resorts uses in WDW Florida. I made cupcakes like ones at Disney.
3,For the price you can't complain,Just looking at the package a lot of them looked broken but once I opened it they weren't to bad. For the price it's not worth complaining and the price is right on.
2,Poor Quality,"Lots of broken pieces in the package, maybe 1/3 of the decorations have one or both ears broken. Disappointing product"
5,VERY GOOD and AVAILABLE,This is a very good book for my 1982 Yamaha XJ750-r. It is one of the few I found that were available. Many illustrations with a down to earth HOWTO approach. I like it.
5,Yamaha XJ manual,This manual is a must if you are restoring and maintaining a Yamaha XJ bike. It gives detailed instructions and photos in a user friendly format.
2,"Staples are fine, packaging stinks","This is just careless packaging/shipping. Every single staple was sliding around the shipping box. All that was needed was a piece of tape on either end.Quite frankly, if you can find them locally, the time you spend putting these back together makes them not worth any savings you might find."
4,Christmas Miracle at Sage,You don't have to wait till Christmas season. This is a good movie to watch all season long .
2,Good actors and poor directing,"I bought this movie seeing that there were several actors I have enjoyed in other movies. However I found the movie a bit stiff and predictable. I can only atribute it to the directing as the actors have all shined in other roles. I didn't hate the movie, but I was left wanting some thing more."
2,OK movie,"This movie was OK, but I was pretty bored. It does not move fast at all and it was hard to keep with it."
2,Blah,"I was hoping for a quality sequel to the original ""Monster at the end of this book"". Not so. It is pretty dull without the exciting build up of the original book."
2,Eh,This book is basically the exact same book only with Elmo thrown into the mix. It loses some of the magic of the original. Or maybe I am just biased toward the first book from my own childhood.
3,not in the best of shape,"I bought this to be a gift, and I was slightly disappointed by the condition of the cover. There was fraying, fading, and the remnants of a yellow sticker. Otherwise, the inside of the book was in good condition, and it arrived within the expected time frame."
3,Diminished returns,"I bought this the same time that I picked up the original again (I had the first book as a toddler way back when) and it just isn't nearly as good. The inclusion of Elmo beckoning the kids to turn the pages is pretty bad. I would've rated it slightly lower but my 2-year-old likes it, however even she prefers the original."
4,Very Cute,"This is a cute follow up on the original. But almost too similar. Not a must have, but cute."
2,Didn't live up to expectations,"My son read the origional, and instantly fell in love with it. So, I couldn't have been more excited when I found ""Another Monster"". But when we received it, and read it immediately, we couldn't have been more disappointed. The addition of Elmo was nice, but the story just did not flow properly. At best, it is just a poor immitation of the first."
1,This book is awful!,"The original monster at the end of this book was one of my favorites as a child and my 14 month old son loves it too, so when I saw this book I was excited to get it. It is so bad I can't even read it to my son. They try to copy the original, but they tried to hard. Adding Elmo doesn't help. I was very disappointed with the book. Stick with the original.The Monster at the End of This Book (Big Bird's Favorites Brd Bks)"
3,"Good, not great","Having grown up with the original ""Monster at the End of this Book,"" I was really excited to get this one, along with the original, for my 16 month old daughter. The sequel is good, and it does include Elmo, but just not as memorable as the first one. I'd say, go with the original and try to find another one for your kids, this one is good especially for the price but not great."
2,Okay...,The first book is MUCH cuter than this one. This one is just okay. I bought it online. If I had read it before buying it I probably wouldn't have purchased it.
2,Another Monster at the End of This Book (Big Bird's Favorites),"I loved the first book, There's a Monster at the End of This Book, but I wasn't impressed with the second (this) book. I remember as a child reading the original, and I had to get it for my 2-year-old son. I thought that he would love the one with Elmo (because he loves Elmo) but he wasn't that into it, and I wasn't thrilled with the story line."
1,"get the original ""Monster at the end of this Book""","This book had potential, but has none of the charm of the original. It is poorly written, Elmo is more obnoxious than usual and Grover is useless. I bought it because my 2 year old loves ELMO. She gets bored with the book and doesn't let us read it. We also have ""the Monster at the End of the This Book"" starring Grover. She LOVES this book, she sits through the whole book, and wants it read over and over. The only thing she does with ""Another Monster"" is occasionally look at the pictures to point out Elmo."
3,It's okay,"This is not a book for 9 to 12 year olds. This is a read aloud book and isn't nearly as good as ""monster at the end of this book"" with just Grover. The Golden Books ($3.99) version has really sharp corners and poor quality paper. It is worth it to spend the extra dollar to get the board book version of either title."
2,Anti Elmo. Just get the original.,"I know that Elmo is very popular, but he essentially ruins this book. The originalThe Monster at the End of this Book (Sesame Street) (Big Little Golden Book)is a classic that was my favorite book as a child and my children love it too. This one with Elmo is just awful. Unless your child is seriously into Elmo, don't bother with this one. Just get the original."
5,Making it understandable,"One of Elaine Scott's true talents is taking a complex topic and making it understandable for children and adults. She incorporates a fabulous mix of history, geography, biography, and science in Poles Apart."
2,"10,000 Games, Was It Worth It ?","When I consider the price, I want to say, "" Great Games ."" But, when all was said and done,I wish I'd have passed on this one.For one, you need the patience of Job, trying to get these in your PC ! ( Wegave up after the second disc ! ) Then you watch to see how often anyone is actuallyplaying them. I can count on one hand the number of times my ages 9 & 12 girls haveplayed. It's 'really corny games verses the difficulty of playing on a computer'"
1,"It's not really 10,000 games. More like a few hundred games with variations of each.","This is the best demonstration of ""shovelware"". A lot of the games lack polish to make them feel like complete games. Or, as in the various Pong and Breakout games, these look like mere programming experiments.It's not really good when the packaging has, ""THE LARGEST GAME COLLECTION IN THE UNIVERSE!"", printed on the front cover. Is that where the extra money went? To engage in a universe-wide search for gaming nirvana? Judging by the production values I doubt that it'll make the NASA security guards laugh hysterically before calling the gentlemen in white coats with such a product in your possession. There are much better games out there which you'd think would be in this pompously-claimed collection.It is what it is on three CD-ROM discs. Biggest collection in the universe? Sounds like those people didn't get out much when getting this crap out the door."
2,not too happy at all,"This set of game disks is a joke. It's like trading in a PS3 for the first Nintendo as far as graphics. Half of the games will not work on my computer. It tells me to change my bits to play some of the games,but when I do they still will not run. I purposly buy computer stuff that goes with my windows XP program and am getting tired of wasting money when I figure out it still doesn't work."
4,Great For Travellers!,"I bought this watch to keep in touch with my own time zone when I went to Australia, which is 14 hours ahead of me. I really liked it, but being a girl, i wish it was a bit dainty-er, and the knob would sometimes dig into my wrist. Other than that it looks great and works great! Glad i bought it!"
4,Great historical detail,"For anyone who wants a well-paced romance with accurate historical detail, this is the book for you.Juliet and Ross are married and have been living separately for 12 years, when they're thrown back together trying to rescue Juliet's brother sparks begin to fly.One of the best things about this novel, is that both main characters have faults, flaws, and their relationship suffers from the problems that real relationships have. It's not all sunshine and smiles for these two, and I liked them all the better for that reason.Another great thing is the amazing descriptions of Central Asia and the Middle East. Although sometimes the details were a little tedious, they really helped the pace of the book, it was a little like watching and Indiana Jones movie.All in all, I found this book to be more serious than most romances. I can't wait to read the other books about the Cameron family."
1,just bought this,just bought two of these and yet i received only 2 60 capsule bottles. when you look below the price it says color name 60 capsules so i dont know what they are selling here. beware that you might not be getting 120 capsules for 15.99.
5,A book you can't put down,"""I Was a Teenage Science Project"" is a fun read for young adults and for those of us who clearly remember the misery of our high school days. The story lays bare the angst that all teenagers face - clothes, hair and the opposite sex -- but with a touch of the supernatural and plenty of good humor tossed in for good measure. Think ""Square Pegs"" meets the ""X-Files."" I loved it!"
1,"If it wasn't free, I'd get a refund.","This book was no where near as good as Poe's first Wave 3. Very shallow. If you are serious about the industry, spend your money on Mark Yarnell's new book, Your First Year in Network Marketing. It's truly outstanding!"
5,A Excellent under standing of MLM,"Whether your brand new to Multi Level Marketing (MLM) or been working at it for a few years, this book is a excellent read. In showing you that your at the right time in developing a MLM business. Richard Poe explains the meaning of the third wave. He has written many books, but buy this one, along with.....Your First Year In Network Marketing by: Mark Yarnell. You will understand how to build a huge business"
3,notgreat,"was hoping for heckle and jeckle episode but these magpies are a male and female pair, not heckle and jeckle despite the advertising. still if you can get it used for $5 or less it's ain't such a bad deal."
2,Bamboo display shelf review,"The unit was poorly packaged with no bubble wrap or protection except a sheet of paper. The main base was cracked, but usable. I did not send it back as I wanted to put the miniature trains up on display for a party. I will attempt to glue it one of these days."
1,DO NO BUY THIS,The item looks nice enough but is poorly constructed. I think it arrived broken because of a combination of poor packaging and extremely poor construction/product. I ignored others who warned against purchasing it because it looked so nice and was the only one that would fit our spice cupboard. My husband threw it away before I could return it so we just wasted away 30 bucks. This item is junk and I expect more from Amazon. They let us down. Buyers beware.
4,Very Helpful,The only reason I give this a 4 is because the bamboo is twice as much as the beechwood. I use this to store my thousand of hot sauces on my counter top. It is so much better than the little basket I was using. I took the expander out and used it on another counter. The expander sits lower than this one.Hope that helps.
1,the one I got was broken in the packaging,I opened my box and it was cracked in several places I noticed before I even got the plastic wrap off of it
4,Exploring the links between country and Celtic,"Paddy Moloney and the lads haul over to Nashville where they round up Willie Nelson, Chet Atkins, Don Williams, Ricky Skaggs and a passel of newgrassers such as Jerry Douglas, Bela Fleck, etc. to jam with them on these pop-hick-Celtic crossovers. Generally a pretty strong album, with some interesting angles on familiar terrain. PS - maybe this is where Ricky Skaggs caught the Celtic bug!"
2,Monotonous,"I'm a fan of the Chieftans but I'm not impressed with this CD. Their ""sound"" is distinctive and sometimes I think the material is indistinguishable from one track to the next. I bought this just for ""Cotton Eyed Joe"", which is very enjoyable."
1,WHAT WAS SHE TALKING ABOUT?,"DUFFY FRANKLY LOST ME AFTER THE FIRST LOT OF POEMS, WHAT WAS HER POLITICAL PURPOSE? IT HARD ENOUGH TRYING TO STUDY IT FOR A LEVEL. CAN ANY ONE REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY SHE FELT IT IMPORTANT TO MAKE HER POEMS EXPLICIT, IF THIS IS THE STANDARD OF MODERN POETRY TODAY THEN I MIGHT AS WELL GIVE UP NOW!"
2,Nothing new,"Is this the state of modern poetry? Duffy has been strangley credited for being original but her political and sociological comments are overdone and attempts to be witty are just dull. On the good side, she writes nice love poems, but unforunately it has all been done before. The theme of loss is well done to start but starts to get 'samey'"
1,Poorly expressed thoughts from a poorly defined poet.,"After reading this book for my as level English Literature course I realised that Carol Ann Duffy's poems are very limited in topics and I'd like to take this chance to express my disappointment. For a poet who's supposed to be well known for being a ""representative poet of the present day"" she doesn't include very many ideas!!I was subjected to many months of torture reading through these poems, one by one, taking notes on the blatently obvious.The captain of the 1964 top of the form team- thinking back to childhoodLitany- thinking back to childhood.Stafford Afternoons- thinking back to childhood.This is what my notes consisted of after all the time spent on them. I was very disappointed in value for money. Bring back Keats into the classroom!"
2,Problem with book contents,"the book is fine...But whoever rates the books for sale is missing a lot. The book had 9 pages (so 18 photo pages not seen) ripped from it. The book also was used by someone who was painting and had spray spots on a couple pages. I plan on keeping the book in my library but will be very careful what is rated in good shape. PAGES MISSING SHOULD BE STATED, I carve so I want these references"
4,about this book,"I got this book to assist me in studying Intermediate accounting.This outline series is with reference to major college text books in accounting.The way the theory is presented in this book,one can very well survive even w/o a text book.The thery part is great and is enough to work the examples given.I AM USING IT AS MY FIRST REFERENCE EVEN BEFORE READING MY TEXT!!"
4,"Great shape for book, shippment was only 1 day late","It was in good shape, the only thing that was annoying was it said it was garenteed to arrive on a certain date, but it was one day late. I blame this more on UPS than Amazon. Everything else was really good!"
2,lacking,"Expecting to hear tales of families and everyday people, this book is instead about a student, Ma Bo, who took up the fight with the Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution. Though Bo tells some interesting stories about how the Red Guard worked, and how ignorant those in power seemed to be, he also feels very sorry for himself and how he was treated. One tires of the whining. Beyond that, some of the translation seemed to use vernacular that was inappropriate or dated. Overall, a disappointment."
3,Was expecting more for my money!,"I purchased this tv a month ago from an outlet store. Just remember, when it says 2, 2 watt speakers, I need not say more. The picture is average at best. The remote is very easy to work because it's basic functions are well, basic! If I had a chance to buy this tv over again, I would, for the price I paid. I'll let you do the shop and compare thing. Oh yeah, it makes expansion and contraction noises when it's on and after you turn it off."
2,Worked for about 18 months,"I bought this product about 18 months ago. It initially has a nice picture. The picture tube is now rapidly failing and needs replacement (fortunately I bought a 3 year warranty). The sound is poor and the plastic case rattles if you turn it up. There are no audio outputs, so you cant connect it to your stereo. The DTV tuner was nice, but I could not connect it and cable at the same time."
4,Jazz musicians don't need studio tricks to sound world-class,"I saw this disc used twice for demonstration purposes at the CEDIA (Custom Electronic Design & Installation Association) EXPO in Denver this year. Great artists, sound and video. Yes, there are people out there that can play in tune and sing on pitch. With all the trash out there it's nice to find this level of soul, intellect and professionalism."
4,Great video,I collect music videos and this is right up there. The quality of the video is good and the music fantastic. Kevin
1,Doesn't play on PS3,"And DSR Media never sent me a replacement, as they promised. Very disappointed with them, and Amazon, shipping defective units."
3,Music Concert,"Good selection of artists, although concert or show is quite short, expected a longer presentation ...overall it is a good concert"
2,"Damn it, rock a little!","I thought ""Rock a Little"" was nicer than Nicks' first two albums, by which I mean that it sounded nicer, was a nicer listening experience, left me feeling nicer after I was finished listening to it. Maybe that's because my expectations have lowered after the uncomfortably uneven directionlessness of ""Bella Donna"" and the chickenbrained drone of ""The Wild Heart."" ""Rock a Little"" feels more loose to me, even if it still sounds cold as ice; she even gets funky once or twice (""Some Become Strangers""). And I like the opening number. Still, no ""Stand Back,"" the catchiest thing she ever did sans-Fleetwood Mac, just a lot of lyrics that never climax (Sample chorus: ""Thing is/Time was/Part of me used to love you/Part of me still does/This light here/Some become strangers""), making them worth--well, about as much as ""Stand Back."""
3,This album is a mess,"I cannot deny that there are about 5 good songs on here, but this album is totally overproduced. Guitars blare at unexpected times, every instrument is turned up at the same volume, and the background harmonies are turned up just as loud as the lead vocal. It's just BLAH!This is definitely one of those albums to buy just for the singles. It does not add up to a whole and Nicks definitely lacks direction. Infact, the best song on here, Talk to Me, is not written by her. Her songs on this album tend to take a gluttoness ""train of thought approach"" which adds up to little. So much for song CRAFTSMENSHIP.Oh well, the 80's was all about Gluttony."
2,Definitively Not Her Best,"This is a very sad album to listen to. True, the music is different and that is ok. Stevie opted to go towards a more pop/dance sound instead of the mystic rock of her previous solo and Fleetwood Mac releases. I could handle the switch in styles and the heavy 80's sound...but the vocals are terrible. It is painfully obvious that her voice had enough abuse at this point and the result is a grating, tired croak throughout the album. Listening to her voice in Bella Donna and Wild Heart in which she weaves her then gorgeous instrument into a spell, is breathtaking. Unfortunately Rock a Little shows what can happen to a gifted voice if it is not taken care of. Her following albums were better but she never completely recuperated (she probably has nodes in her vocal chords). During her tour for Fleetwood Mac's The Dance she hired a vocal teacher and there was some improvement. I hope she is still seeing this voice teacher. I would love to hear her voice improve even more!"
4,Summer of 1985,"This album is one of my favorite of Stevie's...Belladonna has better songs and Wild Heart is euphoric in its intentions...but this album was a summer staple on sun-kissed afternoons at the beach and cruising on balmy summer nights down the boulevard,being 18 and carefree... If I were you is my fave,Talk to me and I can't wait are a close tie for second but whole album minus The Nightmare(still HATE this song)rates as terrific (especially given the coke addled time in Stevie's precious life).This album would get five stars if both Reconsider Me and Thousand Days were included as planned and I would love to hear the first album of ""dark"" songs recorded for this album but ultimately shelved for this group of very good songs. If you weren't around when this was first released,I'm sorry but try it now and let it's charms enchant you today!"
4,Probably one of my favorite of Stevie's albums,"Many people argue that this album is Stevie Nicks at her spaciest. I agree with this statement. However, I love it! The little bit of wacked out spaciness that has seemed to follow Stevie throughout her career is what makes her so darn much fun. Standouts on this album are ""Imperial Hotel"", ""The Nightmare"", and ""Rock A Little (Go Ahead Lily)"" The singles from the album (""Talk To Me"" and ""I Can't Wait"") are not good indicators of the album, but are good songs in their own right. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this album to anyone interested in Stevie Nicks beyond Fleetwood Mac. Her solo career should not be judged from her work with the Mac."
4,Rocking More Than a Little,"Rock a Little, the third solo release from Stevie Nicks includes her last top 5 single, Talk to Me, plus other gems, such as No Spoken Word, If I Were You, Some Become Strangers, and what she called ""the most committed song I ever wrote,"" Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You. The latter piece was inspired by Joe Walsh, who lost a young daughter more than 10 years ago."
3,MISSING STEVIE NICKS,"ROCK A LITTLE is a solid Pop-Rock Album: It show Nicks at her best. The opening song ""I CAN'T WAIT"" is a fabolous hypnotic rock song, ""TALK TO ME"" is a neglected pop classic, and ""HAS ANY ONE EVER WRITTEN ANYTHING FOR YOU"" may be definite a great love song that only Stevie at her best can sing."
4,Great music!,"Love the music, so soulful, and happy. My favorite is I can't Wait! So intense! Great beat!"
3,VOICE PROBLEMS!,"I enjoy ""Rock a Little"" I think the music is very interesting. The only strange part of this album is the various vocal styles....most of which are more nasaly than usual. Also, the vocals are barely existant on a couple of tracks...""Rock a Little"" and ""Sing for the things"". Album gets a bit boring by track 7, could have been trimmed a song or two."
2,Stay away from this one!,"Though I've been a Stevie fan since I was a teen, I seriously dislike this album. I'm well aware that synthesizers were used on Stevie albums released prior to 'Rock a Little,' but the synthesized sound is really overbearing on most of the tunes on this album. This effect makes the entire album (aside from 'Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for You') sound just too ""Eighties pop."" There's not much on here that is reminiscent of the well-loved Bella Donna era. Only a die-hard Stevie fanatic can bear to listen to this one."
3,A little schizophrenic.,"Best songs: ""I Can't Wait"", ""Sister Honey"", ""I Sing For the Things"", ""Talk To Me"", ""If I Were You"", and ""Has anyone ever written"". I personally like this record, but I wouldn't call it a classic. It sounds like she was going through one of her drug periods (which I believe was true of the time). She's going off in different directions. Still, a so-so Stevie album is way better than a five-star Whitney/Shania/(insert wannabe diva here) record any day.""Well I believe that love is a living thing, born into our destinies from a single moment of inspiration, and as it grows, it changes our lives forever.""--Stevie Nicks, ""If I Were You"""
4,excellant book,"This book is excellant if you like the this series. It has it all, recipes, info and music.."
5,"If you like the Dragonlance setting, this book is for you",This book details the unimagineable. If you like knowing somthing more about the world and or people READ THIS BOOK! it is very useful I personally like the numerology section and the RECIPIES (you have to try the spicy potatoes) the granny kender bread is good too.(after eating this bread we then knew why kenders are they way they are)
4,Now THIS is a classroom in the BEST sense of the word,"I thought I'd read 'The Best' works out there on writing, especially a Memoir, but this surpasses all so far since she gives a very CLEAR analysis of using 'your voice' so that you ""intrigue, not bore"" the reader... making the reader believe and trust in your story and guiding them to a conclusion. I like being offered examples to match my work up against, not unlike when you in a writing workshop."
5,write it right- the Gornick way,"The Situation and the Story although easy to follow is a tough read. Gornick's book tells how to read memoirs as well as how to write them. She strives for the highest standards and lays great responsiblity on the wrier's shoulders. Beyond just relating a good story that happens to be true, Gornick expects the writer to impart wisdomto the reader gained by the writerfrom the act of writing the memoir. If the writer didn't gain wisdom, t she probably shouldn't write the memoir.For serious memoirist the book is a must read, and reread, and reread."
4,A classic but slippery,"Gornick's obsession is persona, the truth-seeking and truth-speaking narrator and how that partial, constructed self relates to the tale being told. When you try to apply her interesting principles to some works you like, especially if they are very scenic and narrative-driven, it will drive you crazy. Ditto if you are a writer trying to do what she says you should do. But it's interesting as heck, and she discusses some really interesting essays and memoirs, many of them uncommon or forgotten classics."
2,About judgmental comments,I would not recommend the book to my students. The author makes unnecessary judgmental comments on authors such as George Orwell and Oscar Wild.
2,Pretty pictures but not much more,"I tried to find this book for years to complete my World War I uniforms source collection. It really wasn't worth the effort. The color illustrations are nice looking. But the supporting text bears almost no relevance to the illustrations. There's no description of the materials or construction of the uniforms, no real reference to the equipment worn, and no description of what uniforms were worn by whom or when. Worse than that, there's huge gaps in the uniforms illustrated. For example, there's not a single illustration of a German infantry private in 1914, or any illustrations at all of Turkish uniforms.There are almost no books out there providing anything more than cursory information about World War I unifoms. Sadly, this book doesn't really do anything to fill this gap."
5,"Great Accapella, great contemporary songs, a big favorite","Almost every song is so good I find myself repeating to listen to another part of the harmonies. I love the selections from James Taylor, Paul Simon, Randy Newman and other greats. This one is always in my car.The"
2,it was'nt that great,"this was not that great its a little boring play magazine gave it an A theirs animation that funimation comes out with thats really not that great. I have this boxset and theirs really talking in it and some action, in 2004 after hearing it come out on tv i thought it was going to be interesting with fun action and comedy but when i got the boxset i sad this is a waste of time funimation will tell you their animation is good but they say that to get your money but otherwise this was okay."
5,What a great book!,"I don't understand why this book hasn't been reissued. This is the story of the changes to a New England woodland through the eyes of a box turtle as the woodland evolves into a town through the period 1834 to 1930. There are children, adventures, and major changes in transportation. It's not only a wonderful story in and of itself; it also is a pleasant way for kids to learn a little history. One more great thing about the book is the terrific illustrations. My copy is inherited from my uncle -- I'd LOVE to buy a new edition if it were available. Marjorie Flack is a well-known author and illustrator -- it would seem logical that all her books were still in print."
5,good coverage out here,"No suprises after first monts bill. In comments a user explains hoew to makelg8300 play mp3's. Good coustermer sevice, no waits, english speaking."
1,does not work with leigh jig,This bit has a 10 degree cutting angle-Leigh dovetail jigs require an 8 degree bit
5,brand new great read,this book has all but the powerglide of being a restorer dream. easy to understand with only intermediate level understanding of mechanics. the saler sent a new book happy with the shipping and price.
2,Not a real thorough book,"This book only really covers tear down and build up, There is not a lot of inspection. I really don't see the point of rebuilding a transmission just to put bad parts back in. Not a lot of pictures on the build up side either. I think that I expected more because I have used ASTG transmission manuals before. I would save your money and buy an ASTG manual."
2,Unable to comment!,Regrettably the book was damaged on receipt and had to be returned.In view of the distance it was not deemed worthwhile to have a replacement.The refund system worked perfectly.
2,Immense Perplexity and Bafflement.,"The initial 30 pages (I refused to read further), were unbearably and nauseatingly chaotic and disorganized. Despite implicit benevolent intentions, the author propounded a few ideas and argumnents that should have utilized, at maximum, ten pages. Ideas and assertions could have been stated much more orderly and clearly. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,not that good,"The acoustic membrane looks just like a piece of ordinary plastic. It needs to be pressed hard on the chest before I can hear some faint heart beat sound. Certainly cannot hear any heart murmur, which is the reason I bought a stethoscope, it's quite useless in that regard."
4,SPRAGUE RAPPAPORT STETHOSCOPE,"Very reasonably priced version of a fine instrument that is essentially ""out of print.""As an old fashioned medical educator, I still prefer a stethoscope with a sturdy, sizeable BELL,and have never been able to accept the newer models that claim to ""hear"" low pitched soundsby altering pressure on the chest. This is a real physician's stethoscope."
4,Solid Stethoscope,"Purchased this Spraque Rappaport Stethescope (MDF) for work (CVICU). I've always liked the Spraque Rappaport style stethescopes with the dual lumen tubing. I have better results with ascultation then with the single lumen style (Litmen & others). So this model made by MDF seems superior in construction, very solid and well built. I can ascultate lungs and heart sounds clearly with the MDF brand but not sure how much superior in ascultation to other Spraque Rappaport stethescopes. I would recommend this product if you can afford a little more for a stethescope. But if on a budget I would opt for one various other brand Spraque Rappaport stethescopes that are about $20 cheaper (i.e. Nursing Students). This MDF model does include lifetime diaphragm replacements, that's nice."
3,OK stethoscope,"I ordered this as a back-up for my Littmann. It's well made. I can hear sounds well but not exceptionally well, as is the case with the Littmann Cardiology scope. I think this MDF model would be usefull for EMTs or RNs looking for a good inexpensive scope. I have used similar Omrons and ADC stethoscopes and this one compares well with those, however, I don't see or hear anything that sets this stethoscope apart from those other brands. I do find that the MDF is more comfortable for me so I prefer it over the others. I would suggest that one select a scope from these three brands based on price, color preference and user comfort."
1,Don't judge a book by its cover,"I give this phone 5 stars for design, and 0.5 stars for performance. Constant echo and most of the time static.I bought it at Staples a week ago, and will return it tomorrow.IBM makes great computing hardware and software, but it doesn't seem like cordless telephone sets is their strength."
1,Disappointed!,I learned my lesson on this phone. These reviews are helpful. This phone gets horrible reception. What a waste of money.
1,"Do not ever buy this phone. seriously, ever.","While this phone looks like the coolest thing since the Atari 5200 or maybe the matrix, it just doesn't work well. Sometimes it refuses to come on, sometimes there's static, sometimes it won't dial numbers, it just ... Remember what your uncle taught you: if it sounds too good to be true..."
1,"Fashionable, not functionable..","Unfortunately, all this phone had was its looks. I really expected something great from a 2.4GHz phone, but it performed worse than both my VTech and Uniden 900MHz phones. The biggest problem was static even when you were close to the base. Maybe it needs antennas to help radiate the signal. Pam Anderson may get along fine on her looks alone, but that is not enough for a cordless phone."
1,This phone isn't worth 5 cents,Please do not waste your money on this phone. Even thought it might look cool it has horrid static 24/7. Sometimes it won't dial and if you are 2 rooms away from the receiver there is no reception. We bought this phone in April and have hated it from the start. The buttons are confusing and it seems no thought was given to the layout. I'm not saying anything aginst IBM I love their computers but this phone stinks. Stay away at all costs.
1,i hate this phone,i purchased for the sole reason that the transponder and charge base were seperate- because i only had one jack in my bedroom but needed two. In any case this phone [was bad] from the start - it didn't put together right- so i would just have to leave the battery hanging- it would never properley charge becuase of this. Even when the line wasn't in use it would say it was- when it did work properly the sound quality was much worse than my celli then went and bought a seconf - same problems as the first
3,Not as advertised,"I had ordered this kit as it was advertised as ""like new"". I could overlook a few scuffs or blemishes, but this kit had some significant dents in it. It is still usable, but was definitely not ""like new"". Other than that these are great mess kits."
2,not as presented,"this is aluminium not stainless steel, with some sort of dusty looking grey stuff on it. be careful with this vendor"
5,The real deal,"This is the real deal - it will last longer than I will live, and will put up with daily use. None better IMHO.Buy from a reputable seller dealing in true US issued merchandise and you can't go wrong."
2,"good plate, but","It is a good B.O.B item, I have in the past wrote a bad review of this item, but after using it a few times it does work, but it's not as thick as the one I used back in the early 90's while on active duty.But if you write a bad report these people will email, and harass you until you change your review of the item. So I 'm not going to say the product is bad, because it's not, but the company is not very professional at all."
5,well made,This is very well made. The utensils are loose inside and can make noise when walking. I wrapped then in a spare pair of socks. I would def buy this for camping or a go bag. Well worth it.
5,Built the way they use to build things. DURABLE.,"After purchasing a multi mess kit last year that rattled every step I took, I decided to get something military worthy.I took it out and tested it already.The bottom will build up carbon from the fire, but you just wipe it off easy before you stow it away. So far, I'm loving it."
5,My order,"I will appreciate if you give information about the shippment status of my order, I don't know where is it now.With other courrier companies I can see every day the journey of my order.I expect you be so kind to answer my question."
5,LFN FOREVER,"I loved this show. there are no words to explain how good this series was. it was everything anyone could look for in a tv show and more.i first learned about this series when the cw announced their new version, nikita. and after watching LFN online i had to have the dvds, it was everything i could think of. and i have to say that after i was done watching i could not bring myself to watch the new version. is like i try to get myself to watch it but i just dont like like the new version or at least where it is at the moment.these dvds are worth every dollar. every fan of LFN should have it. peta wilson and roy dupuis will live forever as the most memorable characters in television history."
5,Wusthof Grand Prix,"It is an excellent knife, as everything it of his brand. Good balance sheet in the hand and the handle is comfortable."
5,Excellent Knife!!,"Perfect balance, Super Sharp Blade and very Comfortable Grip. Perfect size for the home cook. I actually prefer the grip of this knife over the Grand Prix II, due to the fact that it feels less likely to slip with the slight curve at the end of the handle - that the Grand Prix II should have kept."
3,Good listings but dictionary found to be better source,"Family of four spent 20 days in Norway, July 1999. Most Norwegians speak some, if not a great deal of English. Therefore, we most often needed a dictionary to interpret signs, etc. We used a dictionary frequently; we used the phrase book only on a few occasions. Reference section quite helpful."
4,Recommended,"A nice little book of phrases for those who want to speak a little Norwegian in various settings, such as restaurants. The book also contains useful information and advice here and there, and the layout is fine too."
5,Helped me plan a trip to Monticello,"I wanted to visit Thomas Jefferson's house Monticello over the weekend and had done some research on the Internet. A few days before the trip, I spotted this book in a local bookstore and decided to buy it because it provides useful information about Monticello and other top attractions in the area. I live in the greater Washington DC area and were surprised to find interesting attractions in the book. I plan to use the book for future short trips to Virginia."
1,Garbage.... head snapped in 2 after 10 log splits,this thing must be made from powdered metal or something. the sharp end of the head snapped off and went flying off at high speed the first time I used it the metal head broke in 2).very dangerous and when I say that the head snapped the blade itself fractured and snapped off leaving the hammer part of the head still on the handle.do yourself a favor and get a forged one piece axe or hatchet. and no it was not being abused when this happened it was regular log splitting duties.
2,"Cast, not forged, head is fragile if hammered","This small hatchet seems to have a lot going for it. I liked the compact size, great sharp edge, and a pretty decent sheath. I took it out back to my fire pit and it cut well. Then I struck the back of the hatchet (with a different hatchet I was testing) to split a half a log. After about three strikes I discovered that this hatchet head is cast metal, not forged as anyone would expect. The casting narrows where the handle molding covers the head, and it had snapped right in two. This was a first for me dealing with any axe or hatchet."
3,"Very well made, tought to get the right leverage for splitting","First, this is a great product and I bring it with me on our car camping, and pack/backcountry hikes. It is very good for chopping small sticks and small logs, but virtually useless for splitting logs. Because of the short handle you are unable to get the correct leverage for such use. I don't necessarily believe that's what this is intended for anyway, but just be aware if you are not familiar with such items."
2,pretty pointless tool,"Well, I bought this hatchet for a backpacking trip because of its weight and the decent reviews on Amazon. The weight is nice and I like the sheath it comes with. I could easily attach it to my pack. My problem, though, is it doesn't really chop any limbs that you can't just break over your knee. Anything thicker than that was a major chore to get through and after one trip, the blade is already damaged. The point of camping equipment is to be small, lightweight, and efficient. This hatchet just doesn't do enough to ever make me take it on another trip."
4,Fine,"Apply is very easy, but 3 months of use. The stickers coming off, which I have to remove them. I recommend this stickers if you what to type in thai, no great product but does the job well."
5,Valuable tool for studying human neuroscience.,"Since I studied ""OPTIMIZING BRAIN FITNESS"" a course via DVD and then reading ""THINK SMART, a Neuroscientists Prescription for Improving Your Brain's Performance, both by Richard Restak M.D., I have been a serious student of Neuroscience and all aspects of brain function in the hope of developing a program of mental exercises to help myself and others combat and defeat dementia, Alzheimer's & other negative effects of aging. This chart has been a huge help in my studies. The company that provides this product also provides a super level of customer-service.John Tyler Gibson, Livonia, Michigan."
2,GD,I liked my older version of this shadeblade because it was wider and darker. Not happy for that reason. Sorry
2,disappointing,"I found this lens disappointing in it's usefulness. I find my Canon 60mm macro lens a far more useful, versatile and flexible lens."
5,Swamp Blues Funk Cum Electro,"This is a great album from Montreal based producer DJ Champion, a.k.a. Roy DuPuy. Combining electronic beats, a jamming chorus of guitars, and vocals from Beatrice Bonafassi, this grungy vibe slowly builds up to a rockin' climax. I never thought I'd want to hear electric guitars in my electronic music, but DJ Champion found a way."
5,Good album for No Heaven,"This is a very decent album, a handful of great songs with some garbage but overall a worthy listen. The hit song here is No Heaven which will be obvious but the song NngG is good too."
4,Great listen!,"This is an album that really grew on me, and got into my subconscious. It's a nice album to have on in the background, or to just relax to listening. It's hard to explain the sounds, it's just a nice ride. Really good hooks and memorable songs."
5,Bad ass game,"Way good game, very long and involving. If you don't like both stratigy and fist person shooters you'll hate it tho."
3,A PENGUIN TRAVELS THE WORLD & RETURNS HOME,"...YES, THAT'S ALL THE ""EXCITEMENT"" THERE IS TO THIS ONE. IT'S A CUTE BOOK, BUT NOT ONE I'D WANT TO READ MORE THAN ONCE. 'SPOTTY' & 'PRETZEL' ARE MUCH BETTER."
5,Star hitch cover,This was my first purchase from Amazon. They provided me with great customer service. I recieved my item quicker then expected. I love the product. GO COWBOYS!!!!!
4,Breathtaking,"The music on this CD is breathtaking. Thomas is imaginative and engaging, but she is also inspired throughout these works. If one listens past the sheer technical brilliance she possesses, they will hear music that is alive, pulling you and inviting you in to an experience."
2,Do not use with 2x 1-1/2 inch interior hoses,"The picture is not what you will get. The item that was received is shaped like a stretched diamond with the widest point at 1-1/2 inches only at a tiny point in the center. Obviously you can't overlap your 2x 1-1/2 hoses over each other on this tiny point, so unless one of the hoses are less than 1-1/2 inches, this will not work. The product pictured would of been nice, as it has a thicker section in the center with each side appearing to be 1-1/2 inches and not a single sharp 1-1/2 inch point in the center like the item received. Oh so lame."
1,Waste,"What a disappointment. Such a waste of resources, the publisher of this DVD is committing crimes against nature. There is nothing on this DVD worth the time to unwrap it. I resent having paid for garbage."
5,joined at the heart--book,Very satisfied with this transaction. Quick shipping. Quality product . Would certainly consider buying from seller again.
5,Excellent monitor / TV,"I wanted the ability to watch TV on my computer and at first I got a TV tuner card with remote etc, what an awful idea, software would hang up remote would not work etc.The planar XP17W has been exceptional, the ease of using the remote with out necessarily having the computer turned on. It has great picture quality with the basic built-in speakers. I added better logitech speakers.I haven't had any stripes or other issues with the tuner. I also plugged a small coby progressive scan DVD player and had no problems with the image.There's also something to be said about them offering a 3 year standard warranty, which others don't. I thought I'd need it but fortunately never had to use it as it's probably a better product. Support has also been great, I lost the remote and they sent another one for free."
5,Complete Kitchen Shears,"These Shears were given a great rating by Cooking Illustrated the magazine. They are made of good quality material, because of the weight and how they feel in your hands and how they perform while cutting up chicken."
2,Not up to usual Grand Prix quality,"These developed rust spots within months. The shears that came with my Grand Prix II set took years to get spots, and the knives from the set have never gotten any spots in the 5+ years I've owned them. (In other words, it's not my care that's causing the issue.)I've emailed WÃSTHOF to see if they can resolve this, but I wouldn't buy this model again."
2,Still A Pack of Lies,"I am very sorry folks, but after reading this book you get the impression that John Wilkes Booth was some sort of a psycho who was born and bred to do something foolish that would get him killed. This view of things is archaic and completely false. Read any recollection about him, from his sister's to his closest friends, and it becomes obvious that John Wilkes Booth was a smart, good, kind man, an incredible actor, and very possibly one of the most considerate human beings to grace the stage. Was it a good idea to kill Lincoln? Of course not, but at least he wasn't a fool like Oswald and had his pictures taken with the very rifle that would be used to kill Kennedy. If you are interested in fiction about John Wilkes Booth, there are quite a few other books that I think you would be interested in, such as Theodore Nottingham's ""The Curse of Cain"" and Finis Bates' ""The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth""."
1,LIES! LIES! LIES!,"I was extremely disgusted by the way this man handled this book. Although I am not an expert of Lee Harvey Oswald's childhood, I AM an expert on Booth's, and 90% of what he talks about are completely false. Read 'A Sister's Memoir' for the real story, she knows much more about him than this fool."
4,Happy moments with Furry Logic books,"As I mentioned in my review of Furry Logic, these books brought a smile to my face many times. I gave this a 4 only because there were a few items repeated from the first book. Both books are a joy to read, however. They make you start the day with a smile on your face."
1,Furry Logic Laugh at Life,This book was used as a present. The recipient of the gift absolutely loved it.Thank you for getting it here for Christmas
1,A big disappointment,"After hearing Johansson's haunting treatment of Scandinavian folk music on Dr. Folk, I couldn't wait to hear this album. Ugh! There are perhaps four tracks worth hearing; the rest is a jumble of overproduced strings, underrehearsed jazz tracks and some electronic novelties, like ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" recorded low on the piano and sped up electronically. Must have seemd cool in the '60's; now it sounds like ""The Chipmunks Play the Classics."" Johansson's best work is great, but there isn't much of it here. BTW if you wonder why everyone raves about the music at CD Baby, just try publishing a review like this on their site . . ."
3,"Cruel Intentions, ""Mommy Dearest""","I have to admit. Author, C. Krasinski, wrote a great book, but some of the material is a little harsh to get over especially when we read stories like this all the time in the news. It should have been titled, ""Mommy Dearest"", because it is similiar to that. I does have a promising end."
