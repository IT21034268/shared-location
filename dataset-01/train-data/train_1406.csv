4,absolutely enchanting!,"Oh,my,gosh,I love this book!After I read it I could only keeprepeating how I would die to go to Ireland.Aidans a doll,Jude isbeyond lovable,and Mr.Riley gets full marks!I'm in the middle ofHeart of the Sea and I must say both it and Tears of the Moon,while charming books,aren't quite as original as the first.But the whole trilogy makes a smashing good read,and Gallagherspub was simply inspired!"
3,not too magical,This was my first Nora book and I really expected more. The story is about Jude and her self reflection which I found to be a bit over done. I only need a few descriptions about beautiful Ireland and after so many I didn't want to hear about the mists and green hills again. BORING. I would have liked to see more passion and romance in this novel. I almost didn't finish it and I am hoping the remaining 2 books will be better.
5,"A Little Magic, A Lot of Love","The first in a trilogy, Jewels of the Sun, brings us Jude Murray retreating to a cottage in Ireland to soothe her wounds after a divorce. Meeting Aidan Gallagher shakes her out of her narrow view of life while Jude explores the folklore of the ghost she finds in the cottage.A well written story of a woman's discovery of her depths and overcoming feelings of inadequacy. Includes some great scenes of women bonding over shopping and stories shared over a drinking spree. Lovely seductions, great descriptions of Ireland and a wonderful cast of people.Do give it a read."
4,A fun read,"I was excited to read this book because I was going to Ireland. I thought, what a great way to get ready for the trip by reading a fun book about Ireland. I was right. The book talked a lot about Irish myths and legends and about the people in the country. I loved the part where the author talked about Jude's experience with driving the car in Ireland (I completely understood) and about the sites of Dublin because I had just gone to those very sites. The love story itself was also good. Adian the handsome Irishman who'd traveled the world and Jude the American who was experience a brand new world outside of Chicago. I enjoyed the way Nora Roberts used myths in the romance and made us appreciate the legends even more. Ireland is so full of history and legends that it's hard to not get swept up in them.Romances are not books I usually read, but I really enjoyed it. If you are going to Ireland, this is definitely a good book to get you excited for your adventure!"
5,Nora Robert's Irish Trilogy,"The book was very good, as was the complete Trilogy. If you have read Nora Robert's Irish series, I highly recommend it. The service was great and the book was received before the date scheduled."
1,Not her best,I have always loved Ms. Roberts books but I have to agree that this is one I could have missed. I found myself skimming through pages - something I have never done with her others. Too much scenic detail and not enough interaction between the main characters.
2,Slight disappointment,"My major gripe with this book from my favorite author was the main character, Jude. She was such a contrast to the usually strong, admirable-even-though-flawed women in Roberts' books. I became annoyed with her insecurities and she wore them out for everyone to see like a badge. Bring back those women characters who can stand up to any man! I've missed them in her last few books."
2,Cheesy,I'd read several stories by Nora Roberts before I came across this book and considering the amount of good reviews it had gotten I was expecting something amazing. But my goodness was I mistaken. I couldn't finish it and finally gave up around chapter 15.I pushed myself to read as much of it as I could but I couldn't take it seriously. It was just one irish cliche after another and I wouldn't be surprised to hear if a few leprechauns popped up later in the story . There seemed to be endless paragraphs describing the misty green hills and the red haired freckled faced women of the village. And don't get me started on the dialogue. It was so corny that I would cringe when I'd read it.I didn't enjoy Roberts' take on life in Ireland and I'll be staying well clear of any other books set in the Emerald Isle !
5,I fell in LOVE!,"Amazing! This was the first Romance Novel I have read in many many years. I thought it was written wonderfully. I was completely captivated from start to finish. I not only fell head over heels in love with Aidan, but I also fell in love with Ireland as well. I found myself dreaming about going to Ireland and meeting Aidan myself! I have read Tears of the Moon, and it was Wonderful as well, but my true love sticks with Aidan even though Shawn is as cute as a button. *L* I can't wait to read the 3rd book in the trilogy!"
5,"Romance,Intrigue,Travelogue!","I hadn't read a Nora Roberts book before and chose this one because we are planning a trip to ireland and I liked the idea of ""hearing"" about the area in a fictional context. Loved finding this , for me, ""new"" author and was thoroughly engaged in the content of the tale and the lush description of the area! I enjoy Pat Conroy and found similarities in Roberts' delicious use of language. Barbara Hammerman-"
2,"Ireland, here I come!","Thanks to this book, I'm now in love with Ireland. Ireland is beautiful and glorious and the skies are blue and strangers open their doors wide for me.But frankly, this story is snoozesville. The heroine is your typical sappy no-confidence no-clue woman who realizes, ""Gee! I don't love my ex!"" while having tea with a Wise Woman in a scenic inn. The hero is your typical see-her-want-her tepid sort of guy. What's to stop them from snogging at first sight? Well, there's always the heroine's contrived no-confidence plot angle.This book is pretty, scenic, well-written, but it is also slow-moving and nothing actually happens. All that's missing is the ""Sound Of Music"" soundtrack when Jude walks around Ye Irish Countryside.File this under ""Favorites Of The Irish Tourism Board""."
1,Put it back on the shelf,"This is so bad it's scary. Do people really want to read this stuff? It has no substance, no plot, no dimension, no reality, no sense, no strong women, and throws women back in the dark ages. The main woman character has no thoughts in her head other than, wow what a cute big strong Irish guy, I hope he falls in love with me or little helpless me will fall apart. Her other challenging thought is - oh there isn't a microwave in this cottage in Ireland - help I am on my own - oh look a stove - I might have to cook -ooh I can't handle it. Come on, we need a little more substance here. Women are now allowed to have IQ's."
1,Irish? I think not.,"If you are going to write a book that is the ""first in the new Irish trilogy"" you could at least take the time to spell the names correctly. Sean is not spelled Shawn, Seamus is not spelled Shamus, etc."
3,Pink Novel,"I tried to find a good novel, since I finished Linda Lay Shuler, and Jean Auel novels, but I fail to choose this type of pink novel, is not my type of reading."
3,Stubborn story woven with folktales and dreams,"My mom recommended this book to me by saying that it was about fairies and wishes and things she didn't believe in and couldn't relate to. My intial reaction was that it was far too fanciful for me, I read the synopsis on the back of the book and was less than intrigued. Fairies. Bah. Myths. Who cares since they aren't real? Magic. Do people still believe in that? Well, apparently I do. This book has the ability to appeal to the dreamer in anyone. The part of you that believes in friendly ghosts, energetic fairies and magic. The main characters--Jude Frances Murray and Aidan Gallagher--are two of the most stubborn people I've ever read about. At times I wanted to jump into the fray and give them both a good smack. Which is another reason I enjoyed this book immensely. Beyond revitalizing a part of me that I thought was lost, it made me care about the people involved. I can't really ask for more from a book."
4,Next best thing to a trip abroad!,"From the first pages, the reader finds herself in the most colorful and delightful of places - rural Ireland. One can almost smell the flowers and feel the warmth of the people in this tale of the real, and the not-so-real. It takes the heroine, with the contemporary values and pressures of America today and transports her to the breath-taking beauty, mystery and myths so much a part of the Ireland of times past. The characters are unforgettable, and the lessons learned are pertintent to us all. The reader hates to reach the end of the book, and hopes for more."
5,Couldn't put it down!,Aidan and Jude made me laugh and made me cry. It made me wish I could visit Ireland. I am waiting anxiously to find out what happens to Shawn in Tears of the Moon. Hurry Nora!
3,Jude the Obnoxious,"A beautiful travelogue, a whimsical glimpse into the legends of Ireland - and one of the most obnoxious female ""heroines"" ever written is basically my review of this book. Loved the picturesque flower covered Faerie Hill cottage, the star crossed for centuries ghosts, the ceili and the charming locals (who ALL seem to settle their disputes with a quick punch and then a wee dram). However, it was all a little too contrived. The Jude character was an absolute ""poor little rich girl"" who evoked NO sympathy, empathy, or believability - I just didn't buy her story. I also struggled with an Irishman named Shawn (isn't it Sean?) and the saccharin charm of the romance was just way too much for this reader. But I will move on and read Tears of the Moon, for really I loved the Irish part of the tale."
4,Jewels of the Sun,Nora Roberts readers will enjoy this novel set once again in Ireland. This book is similar to her earlier novels Born in Fire and Born in Ice. Very entertaining.
4,Her best since Born in Fire series,"Just finished the novel and enjoyed very much. The setting was the selling ace for me. As a contemporary romance, I truly enjoyed due to the story line and the description of the countryside and life in a rural village of Ireland. I could have done without the fairie involvement, but thankfully this was not a major aspect of the story. The ending leaves you hanging as to whether the curse of the fairie prince and his Lady was broken when Aidan and Jade became committed to one another. The introduction to Shawn's story (Book 2) indicates they are still cursed."
3,"Not her best, but still enjoyable...","Nora Roberts takes the reader back to the glorious setting of Ireland. The dialogue is earthier than in her previous works, but the warmth of her characters still shines through.Ms. Roberts writes so vividly of Ireland that I am transported whenever I read any of her ""Born"" series and this one is no different.Unfortunately, Jude seems to be virtually identical in personality to the fragile, insecure Rowan of Enchanted. Also, her external manner seems recycled from Dr. Griffin in Inner Harbor.Still, Ms. Roberts is a master storyteller and despite the annoying heroine, the ensemble and setting are delightful. I look forward to reading more about Darcy and Shawn in the rest of the series."
4,Wonderful Irish Myth and Magic Storytelling,"Another Wonderful book from Ms. Roberts. Loved all the Irish magic and Ireland setting for this modern day story. Adian and Jude are wonderful, strong, and fun people who fall in love despite their stubborn nature, one or both, and you can't help but fall in love yourself. A must read. On to the next ""Tears of the Moon"" story in her 3 book Trilogy. What a Charming Family and all they will do, and not do, for this thing we call love."
5,"Get a cup of tea and have a seat, It's a wonderful tale!","I have to say that Jewels of the Sun is a warm, touching, funny, feel good story that could warm your heart on the coldest of days. It leaves you day dreaming of Irelands tranquility and excellent hospitality of your neighbors. It's a story of a woman named Jude, who lived stressed out in a big city, and found ""home"" in her family's cottage on an enchanted hill in a quaint town in Ireland. Love were her neighbors in each direction. And peace of mind she found in it's hills. Although almost 30, her life was now only beginning. A romance finds her, for the first time she has true friends, and most importantly, she finds herself.This wonderful story must be read. Thank You Nora Roberts for bringing joy into my life."
3,An easy read,"I have to agree that this is a medium book for NR. Yet, for her that is still above average. It seemed rather slow at the beginning and the characters were somewhat boring at times. I sensed no great passion, but Ireland was enchanting as well as the reader in the unabridged version. Give it a try for a change of pace."
4,Romantic Charmer...good for a summer's day read,"I enjoyed the book, however I don't feel it was the best that Nora Roberts has written. The plot was laid out from early on...so very little complex thinking needed for this book. There is no suspense what so ever. BUT.. a good romantic tale with beautiful imagery, I was throughly swept off my feet with Ireland and the interesting folk that inhabit the mythical island..including my namesake ""Brenna"". The next book shall be interesting with her and Shawn's courtship."
4,Takes me away.....,"I haven't found a book written by Nora Roberts - or J.D.Robb, that hasn't held my interest from the very beginning. Her descriptions of the characters & the places make you feel that not only do you know these people, but that you want to go & find romance yourself. After finishing a book, I always hope that there will be a sequel with the same characters at a different time in their lives."
5,Excellent !,I read this book in three evenings and could not put it down! This is definitely going to be another hit trilogy for Nora Roberts! Cannot wait for the next installment!
5,Jewels of the Sun,Love reading Nora Roberts books.This one is set in Ireland & you learn some old folk tales from the story
1,Pass on this,"This book is silly. Faeries and the like, oh baby yeah that's really romantic. Yeah right. I'm a Roberts fan, but i think her little ""fun and harmless"" books are getting to be pretty...fruity. Stick with longer books, where she's able to develope and be oh i don't know... slightly realistic."
4,Easy installation and functional,Alignment with the wall studs was easy due to the detent installation guide (plastic ring). The ring also offers very secure installation to the wall studs.
2,Not the best choice,"The book is well written, but is neither the most thorough treatment of the topic, nor the most authentic treatment. Readers wanting to know what the Jewish traditions are, and why, and how to do them, will want Lamm's book on this subject. Readers who enjoy presentation and validation of creative but non-traditional practices adapted or invented by less observant Jewish mourners will enjoy this book."
5,Helpful guidance,"Though I have been getting in touch with my Judaism over the past year and attending shul regularly, when my grandmother suddenly passed away I found myself asking many questions. Going to shabbat services is great for embracing Judaism for everyday life, but there are many things about the Jewish tradition associated with death, especially of a family member, that you just don't get exposed to normally. This book was a wonderful guidance in the days following my grandmother's death and for weeks afterwards, as I embraced what my culture traditionally did and remembering that I am just one person; while many people have passed away before, and many still will, death and healing are very raw and critical part of life and not something to hide from.I didn't really want to do the whole ""healing exercise"" thing that other books recommended, I just wanted to heal my way with some guidance from somebody who knows what the tradition usually is. This book was perfect for that."
5,spiritual useful,"if you feel the need to mourn , or to know a way to mourn rather,this book is effective"
4,Wonderful so far,"I have only reached the second chapter and am really enjouing the lucid , guy next door simplicity of the read. I am a huge fan of Aquinas , final causes etc, and can't commment at this point much beyond his marvelous concision in treating the mind / body issues. I much agree with the previoius reviewers and their enthusiasm. Whether I will run into implicit positions with which I find problems is yet to be determined (forgive the pun), but I freely will to continue."
1,TMOBILE IS WORST PHONE SERVICE I HAVE EVER SEEN,"Tmobile has worst phone service provider i have ever seen , i have contacted a lot of times to solve issues , they did not care they just ignored , they transfer to another department a few times and you will be lost in the middle of nowhere.so i will never and ever be a Tmobile customer and i do not recommend to anyone .JUST STAY AWAY FROM TMBOBILE AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE."
4,Early look at what a visionary Todd Ruondgren always has been.,I've always loved Nazz and was so excited to get the first album on CD.It has stood up amazingly well.
5,Dreamy.....,"Just as its title suggests, this CD is truly sublime and subtly rich. There are few CDs that I can listen from beginning to end because of mediocrity or disjointedness or some other reason which I'm sure most you will have encountered.When I first heard the beginning track I knew that I had stumbled upon quite a gem. I, too, was dismayed at Telepopmusik's debut but all my fears of a repeat were allayed as I continued listening. The tracks all fit seamlessly together - it feels right. I highly recommend this!"
3,Not enough angel milk to kill the thirst,"""Don't look back"" is one of the best songs I've ever heard and this song alone is the best reason to get the cd. Other highlights include ""Stop running away"", ""Into Everything"" and ""Close"". Despite the moments of brilliance, ""Angel Milk"" somehow is missing something - the only true gem is ""Don't look back"" and no other song lives up that one. Some tracks sound like fillers to me. Still, if you need some kind of soothing balsam to your soul, ""Angel Milk"" would be a good choice."
1,dont have yet!!,"This is my second attempt in the last month ordering music from Amazon, and it still yet to arrive!! im so annoyed!"
4,Their Best Work,This is easily the best release by Telepop. Everybody likes Breathe but they have many tracks better than Breathe in my opinion.
3,ehh...,"I'm going to buy this album, but I don't like the fact that it's overloaded with the singers - Telepop was looking for another ""Breathe"" hit - maybe they'll find it, but I'd rather hear the music by itself."
3,Poor packaging for great content,"Amos Oz is plain-spoken, lucid, brilliant. But Princeton UP did a disappointing job with the production of the book. The 2 essays and 1 interview that make up this book are short, and you can't change that. But what kept them from using larger paper? With exactly the same type-setting but wider margins, we would have gotten a beautiful small book. Instead, it looks like one of those over-priced mini books of bad poetry."
1,"Protect your cards, REALLY... HOW?!","I initially got these because I thought they were the thick plastic sleeves that people put their most valuable cards in. That was my mistake and not the seller/amazon.These things are like very thin plastic sleeves with a strange design.I couldn't find a way to put my cards in these things without damaging the card. Strange right, you buy sleeves to protect cards and instead risk damaging them with this product. I like ultra pro, but they messed up by releasing this product line."
3,Dark Cloud is a hard game to write a book for - and Prima,"shows you exactly why. One big replay point for Dark Cloud (DC) is the RANDOMNESS of the dungeons. Apparently the group that wrote this book didn't realize this. Several limited zone floors that are listed as concrete numbers are in fact variable game by game, and a great deal of item info is flat-out wrong. Several pieces of info are repeated over and over, with the exact same text and caption. Example: They explain what a pool of water does for EACH AND EVERY DUNGEON! They easily could have condensed this guide into a three page fold-out in a magazine and wouldn't have lost a word of information.I rate strategy guide by percentage of information you wouldn't get from an Internet FAQ. I give the DC Primagames guide a 2% - for the pictures."
2,Didn't help even a bit,"I thought it will help me a lot but all I got was an advice to play the entire game with one character (what you will do anyway) the game is easy without it save the money and buy ""devil may cry"" and its official guide belive me it's better."
3,Did all they could,"Given a game where the dungens change every time you play them, I think they did pretty good. The guide lines out the aranging of the villages pretty good. It's main weak point is it's lack of help on monsters, like their attributes and such. Still worth the money though"
1,I can order it for $15 dollars at a book store,Just ordred it from a book store for $15 dollars. Beat that. These people selling them R ripping U off.
3,Product is an upgrade from CS1 ONLY,"Nowhere in Amazon's product description or on Adobe's website does it say that this version of Standard CS2 is an upgrade for CS1 ONLY. I am a licensed user of both Photoshop 7 and Illustrator 10 and, confused by the different CS2 upgrade offerings, checked carefully before buying.Only on the product box will you find ""This upgrade version of Adobe Creative Suite Standard will install only if you are a licensed user of Adobe Creative Suite Premium or Standard 1.x.""Now I have to return it in exchange for the proper version, which is frustrating."
5,its awesome!,this book makes me feel like i know exactly what to eat and be healthy while im being a vegetarian. its an easy read :)
2,Nothing Like The Other Spyros,"This game is absolutely nothing like the old Spyros that we all know and love. There are no collectibles, no one to interact with, and Sparx is very annoying in this game. I actually just started playing it so I'm at the very beginning of the game, but it's so mind numbingly boring for me that I don't think I even want to continue. I see no fun in walking thru a swamp beating up enemies. I prefer the old format better where there was a home world, you collect gems, beat up enemies, collect eggs or free dragons, and have access to other levels. Bottom line, this game is boring unless you like dark games or fighting games. On a positive note, the graphics are incredible, and I absolutely love that Gary Oldman is the narrator!Game Ratings...Game Play 2/10Storyline 2.5/10Graphics 10/10Music 9/10Fun 1/10Overall 2/10"
1,sooo disapointing,"i love the spyro games. they are my all time favorite. the peace of avalon, going through portals running around collecting gems..circle for fire square to charge x to jump, the ability to skip through the movie bits. I have 3 spyro games downloaded on my ps3 and was so excited when my husband bought me a ps2 and this game to start my collection...and then crushed. why? b/c this game is awful. its combat combat combat [which i hate, why other reason would i love spyro so much?] and the graphics are completely different, the controls are different, and you HAVE to sit through the movie part. boring. i played for 10 minutes before saying screw this. Button combos? wtf?"
1,Disappointed,"I have been a spyro fan for years! I love spyro and always have. I didn't know they came out with a new one til I just happened to see it on the shelf. I got so excited! I told my husband that was what I wanted for our anniversary. Man, I feel like I should have went with jewelry. The movie parts were extremly long. One thing I always loved about spyro is that their was several worlds inside of 1 realm and their were always multiple realms. I beat this new spyro game in 1 day. I was so disappointed. Sparx didn't do anything exept talk and thats it. There were no puzzle games, no side games, and no fun. The boss at the end was just as easy as the very first one. I just feel like I got the short end of the stick."
3,Spyro,"I enjoyed this game. The only thing I didn't like too well, is that I fought monkeys the whole time, except in boss battles. Then I would fight a dragon. That's it, as far as monsters go. I enjoyed the game, but if your looking for some different monsters to fight, there is not any selection. You just fight monkeys the whole time. A boss battle is a dragon.There is a place for dragon training, which drove me nuts, but other than that I enjoyed playing this game.I thought the cut scenes were cool and this game looks trippy like, with the mushrooms. I liked the feel to the game. I enjoyed flying and using fire breath.There we things I liked and hated, while playing Spyro."
2,It had ptential,"this game had so much potential. excellent graphics, good sound, decent level environments, easy controls, new moves, interesting 'breaths'. but it was very short and very repetitive: the main enemies were one character throughout the entire game, they just changed costumes in each level [only about 6 levels, no portals], these main characters also made the same sounds throughout [a few different rivals are added due to the level you are in].there are constant film sequences interrupting game play, some in which you can not skip.and there is little to no reply value like the first 3 games in the series [for Playstation] and the level where you learn your new powers can not be passed by, this would be nice to skip if you have already beaten the game once.>> note: no more portals here. if you want classic Spyro, your looking in the wrong place. this game was disappointing. fun for the first run through. [] suggested rent, before purchase. []"
2,Unimpressive Spyro Game from a Spyro Lover,"I have played Spyro since the beginning. I have been a huge fan of the concept and the way the versions have improved over the years.The latest chapter in the Spyro series has some cool new moves and the famous voices make it a bit more interesting. However, that's all that I liked about this Spyro.You spend a good portion of the game in training, with no choice of continuing the game without finishing it. The worlds seem to be less '3-D' due to the fact that you are forced down one path and one path only.Finally, it took only a couple of days to finish the whole game - I want something that lasts longer.It was very unsatisfying and I hope that if they come out with another version they go back to their Spyro roots."
2,Spyro A New Ending!,"I'm sorry, but where is the old Spyro where you collect gems? The only thing I really liked was the graphics, and I didn't like that it plays like an RPG. If you like playing RPG's then I would play this, but if you like the old Spyro's do not!"
2,Spyro...Super Easy To Beat!!!!,"This game, Spyro a New Beginning, was way too easy to win. Not at all like any of the other Spyro games. The voices were cool and the graphics were very good. My 9 year old daughter thinks it was really good, but too easy to beat also. She also agrees that it was too different from the other games. She has replayed it a bunch of times, so it must be some kind of fun. We both enjoyed playing it through the first time. I wish they would make a Spyro game the old fashioned Spyro way!!"
2,What to say?,"I do not yet have this game but reading the reviews it sounds exactly like the second game in the Legend of Spyro series. I am mainly reviewing to say that my opinion of Enter the Dragon hasn't changed at all... give Insomniac the reigns to the Spyro series because they did it better. The original Spyro games (for the PS) are much better. I loved Spyro because of the collecting of gems, eggs and other items not for the fighting and that is exactly what Universal or whoever is making the games now has done is made into a long, continous, and therefore boring battle. All I can say is don't waste your money on the Spyro games for PS2, PS3 or the Wii."
2,Legend of Spyro a new beginning,"The game is nothing like the others. This one took 6 hours to play and there was nothing more to it than the one task. The other games at least had a little adventure to them. I kept hoping there was more, but there wasn't. It ended very weird. It just ended but it seemed like there should have been more to it. Not worth the money I paid for it."
3,Spryo-Is ok game,This game is ok but very was very easy to beat it only took 2 days after that this game is very boring and there are no special stuff like on alot of other games.
3,It is different to the previous Spyros,"It is different to the previous Spyros, it is no longer so innocent, requires more dexterities to play it"
2,Major Letdown but Pretty to Look At,"It's interesting that this game depicts Spyro's beginnings because with THESE beginnings you'd expect Sypro to have been some kind of Jedi Knight by the time he made it to A Hero's Tale (or perhaps in therapy). In ""Legend"" Spyro is more like a ninja than the cool, sassy fun dragon whose biggest enemies are Gnorks and an Evil Neptune in drag. I gave up on the game after the second round of training for moves that would make the most dexterously agile 12 year old need AsperCream for his thumbs. Anyway, this is a really neat idea with beautiful graphics, but the whimsy-with-challenge charm that Spyro has previously had (super early games excepted because I haven't played them, so I don't know) is lost to a very dark and somewhat violent game that is dominated by the player being under basically constant and copious attack. It's really too bad, because it had a lot of promise, and I enjoyed the start of it the game."
3,Okay...,"This is an okay game, but WAY too easy and it takes way too much from the old Spyros. I mean, what happened to the days when Spyro was a simple character in a simple fantasy world with a loose plot? The first one was fantastic, and the other four were pretty good, too. This one was interesting, but if you're planning on playing it, rent it. It's really easy to beat."
2,Boring!! Rent don't Buy!!,"I made the mistake of asking my husband to buy this game for me for Christmas. I did no research because I was basing my Spyro ""wants"" on previous games but I wish I had now. I beat this game in less than 7 hours and it was the same thing over and over. There was too many dragons talking, too many movie clips (which you can't get out of) and was just plain boring. I kept playing in the hopes that it would get better and more difficult, but was very disappointed when I beat Cynder the first time I tried. I wish it was like the first Spyro's in that there were many worlds (not 5) and there were other side activities to play. This one was the same all the way through. Beat the bad guys, collect NO gems or dragonflies, and once in a while get a new breath which you had training for."
2,I feel burned,"As a dracophile, I want to be able to give this game a higher rating. The reason I can't is because its replay value, while more than 0, is less than 1. I could do without the whole ""mash the same buttons to do the same move with a different breath in an unskippable scene"" bit too.Because of this game, I've figured out what it is that bothers me about the ""artist's shortcut"" of band-scales/scale plates in dragon art: often the scale plates start on the dragon's chest rather than the bottom of the lower jaw, and that is exactly what we see on the dragons here. My philosophy on that is: either draw all of the scales, or none of them. Plus Spyro's horns look more like they're glued to his head rather than growing out of it, and his nostrils look like an afterthought.It was fun the first time, and until I had all the breaths powered up the second. Now I feel burned. Give Spyro back to Insomniac."
1,Not anything like the original,"I was horrified when we got this. It is useless fighting. I want my spyro back. Everyone loved it, especially me.This was boring."
3,"Somewhat misleading title, not for the afictionado","I found the title of this book somewhat misleading. It is only the very end of the book that gets into ""before the beginning,"" and most of the book is simply a preparation for this ending. Most of the book is simply a rehash of what is already readily available in a dozen other popular books on cosmology, although it does reference some of the latest discoveries, such as extrasolar planets. If you're really interested in what it might be like ""before the beginning,"" Guth's _The Inflationary Universe_ is far superior. I'm nudging this book above average (6) because the last few chapters do contain some fascinating material on the nature of the cosmological constants that provides food for thought."
4,A good story of our universe 10e-36 seconds onwards,"A good book for readers who have a decent understanding of physics and in some cases a little more than that is required. A fascinating book which I had to read to completion, even though, sometimes, I could not fully grasp some of the concepts. My next step is to get hold of a fundamental book on astronomy to get more familiar with the lingo. I like the book because it gives decent weightage to other physicists/astronomer's thoughts and opinions and is a lively commentary on the developments in the field."
3,Dumbing Down Science,"This book is very well written, but to get the actual Planck time value of 5.3906*10^-44 seconds, I had to do a web search. The formula of Sqrt(G*hbar/c^5) wasn't in the book either... in fact the book almost entirely lacks formulas of any kind. I suppose this is very good if you are writing for 6th graders who have to look up the big words, but that makes this not an adult book at all, no matter how well written and how eminent the scholar that wrote it. Cosmology is a subject where all of science comes together in a &#65533;big picture&#65533;, but the details are very important as Dr. Rees explains. Just how they are important seems to be beyond our understanding? Only in a world where papers by Cambridge scholars are either totally unreadable with jargon or dumbed down beyond any real use! Dr. Wheeler still includes mathematics in his books, thankfully!"
2,Lots of review,"Has to be considered a beginners book. Hard to read at times, dry and lacking clolor. Decent for a first-timer though"
3,Prejudiced Book,"I am sorry but I did not like the tone by which the author presented his logic. I did not feel in it a much acurate way to present scientific materials. I read better books on the subject. Moreover, there is nothing in this book that talks about ""before the begining"" of the universe. It should be titled ""before the begining: This is the way I want you to think""...! I am sorry!"
4,"Great Lead-Off Single from ""Off the Ground""","Paul McCartney found true international success for the last time with the 1993 album ""Off the Ground"". The album was preceeded by this single.""Hope of Deliverance"" (4 tracks, 16 min.) starts off with one of Paul's best songs in memory. It is reminiscent of ""Deliver Your Children"" from 1978's ""London Town"" album, just a georgous, dreamy track with superb vocal harmonies. ""Big Boys Bickering"" is a laid-back tune, with country influences, really nice. ""Long Leather Coat"" is a rockabilly tune and works really well. ""Kicked Around No More"" is perhaps the best tune of the 3 B-sides, a pensive tune that could've/should've been on the album (replacing, say, the dreadfull ""Biker Like an Icon"").Off all the singles from ""Off the Ground"", this is the one to get: great title tune, and superb B-sides. Not to be missed by any Macca fan!"
1,I bought both models & they both broke right away,"These ""Mary Marvel"" dolls are very poorly made. I bought both models, the red and the white, for my little girl. We'd been playing with other action figures -- Spider-Man, Wonder Woman -- and she was very excited to get two more girl figures to play with. Within minutes, the right leg snapped off the red doll; the next morning the white doll lost an arm.These figures are stiff and brittle. They don't pose easily and they break at the slightest pressure. My kid was really upset at how flimsy these were. Good to look at inside a box, maybe, but a lousy toy."
5,Marvelous!,"A great book from perhaps the best authority on Pearl Harbor's surprise attack and how it changed the world. We appreciate Amazon's always being there for our used and new books needs -- and for other items as well. Great company, great service. God bless you all! Thank you very much!"
3,Pretty Satisfied... but fragile,"It's a perfect size; not too big not too small. But be careful though, for it is very fragile."
2,Not really a great book,"The war is over and its a time for the people of Bridge End to celebrate. For Lizzie it means the return of her husband Alec who has been a POW. For Heather, Ian who been away fighting for six years, it would mean that she wouldn't have to work the farm anymore. But is that something that she is willing to give up? And for Ruth, would she have to give up Sammy, a boy that is very close to her heart. The war many be over, but the battle will continue.""A Farthing Will Do"" is the second book in Lilian Harry's ""Bridge End"" series. But I have to say I didn't really like it. There was something about this series that I just didn't enjoy. Ms. Harry's ""April Grove"" is so much better."
4,This one is up there.,"Like the title says, as far as my list of favorites goes, this one is up there. Let me start off by saying the reason I gave it 4 stars is because of my opinion of the ending, it just seems to go a little extra nuts in the last episode and then left me slightly disappointed with the way it all ended so for that it lost a star. However, that being said aside from the feeling of disappointment at the ending the rest of the show is great. It is one of those that is drawn well enough that I do find myself thinking ""Gee she is cute."" rather then ""My that's nicely drawn"" So yeah good animation. The story while lacking an original plot(as most anime and tv shows in general all follow the same basic plots these days) was a generally good story with a definite intuitive twist on a relatively staple anime plot. So all in all as you might guess by this point. Yes I do recommend that you at least give this one a shot because you might like it."
4,NEW TO ANIME? TRY THIS OUT.,"In my never-ending search for something different I recently began to read manga and view anime genre stories. This Ugly Yet Beautiful World was the second or third complete series I purchased. This is a facinating and complex story. Rated TV-MA it's not for younger audiences but older teens and even adults like myself will enjoy a well balanced story developement. Then character and scenary art are attention grabbers and very entertaining. Not a ""must see"" but a fine choice nonetheless for anyone looking for something different. Thanx!"
2,not so bad but really not good,"this show was not as bad as jinki extend but it still was not very good. two alien girls, two human boys, two robots and asorted side charcters make up the show. like others have said boy meets girls saves her from monster and so we start the show. i was surprised how little the monster saving was in the show. plus the beginings were all recaps for about 3 or 4 minutes of the last episode. at least the fan service was done when it would hapen in life. the colors, pictures and sound were excelllent. so i would say a good one viewing when can't find anything else."
1,Would not recommend,"my drive was easy to use , but data is virtually unrecoverable if you have a problem. I used it with a mirror drive, but if the main drive breaks there was no way to access the mirror drive data, even after the main drive was fixed. No emails to support were answered ,after I got a hold of a phone support tech, I was told I should send it to a data recovery service, but since the data is stored in simpleshare's own ""modified reiserfs"" format, two separate data recovery services have had problems"
2,Not so simple,"I wish I had the great luck as those who claim they have. On the positive, mine has been running for nearly a year, as well as another I've installed on a friend's network. With both systems, after a power down, we have to run NASfinder to identify the drives. Often this doesn't work unless you disable the print server, the print server is on by default. We've set our ip addresses static and are able to map the drives by them. One computer on my home network of 6 can never see the simpletech no matter what.I use this drive as central storage for multimedia files, we can watch streaming AVI on 5 computers without a problem. For the price I paid I can put up with the b.s., but no one else in my house can make if work if it goes down while I'm away. I would give a higher rating if Simpletech would provide a firmware update to make the print spooler off by default."
2,Not so Simple,"This is the first NAS device I bought, hoping to use it for backing up all my PC's and laptops at home. Sharp looking device with good potential but not as simple as the name indicates. It has a slow CPU and is limited to 10/100 Mbps network (1000 Mbps is standard on most other NAS servers). The SimpleShare worked for a total of 15 mins after which it showed consistent permission errors. The drive failed to attach (or publish) itself to the Windows network. Having networked offices nationwide, I'm fairly familiar with the diagnostic routines. After two days however, I gave in and called SimpleTech support. Over the course of two additional days (and long hold times), I spoke to 3 different people, neither of whom could help me solve the problem. Two of them actually suggested I should just return (not exchange!) the product and find something more suitable. In the end, I took their advice."
5,GREAT VHS,This albun was a great hit back in the early 90s (1992) when it was released. This VHS features 4 videos:1. Lay all your love on me2. S.O.S.3. Take a chance on me4. Voulez-Vous
5,Best live shows I have ever seen!,Erasure is totally one of the most underrated and underappreciated acts around. This particular release was surreal but great fun and done with real spirit and sincerety for ABBA.
1,"I should have listened to ""don't bother"".","This book (actually it would be better described as a pamphlet) is not worth your time. I thought, ""well, if I just get one idea from it, it would be worth the purchase price."" Well....I was disappointed."
4,Good Value Street Tire,"If you do not need any type of extra special tire, this is a good tire for the price. I bought it to use on my rear wheel b/c I bought a bike trainer also and my mountain bike tire is too knobby. I also did not want to cause excessive wear on my mountain bike tire. I did not realize until I changed the tire but my original tires are also Cheng Shin. I haven't had any problems with them and from what I can tell I likely will not have any problems with this one."
2,An Ok Book,"Not very easy to read and is not as inspiring as other books by Handy, such as ""The Empty Rain Coat"" and ""Waiting for the Mountain to Move"".A some sort of disappointment."
2,I Just Can't Relate,"I bought this book because I was having a crisis and I'm 27. I read it cover to cover, but I was really disappointed, because at the moment, I am not a career woman. I had planned to be a career woman with a family, but (long story short) I am a soccer mom in training still searching for that perfect career. Only 1 or 2 people in this book were married and the whole thing just seemed to speak to single grads on the career track. I think this book could be great for someone answering to that description, just not me."
1,Mediocre at best,This book addresses some essential issues which have not been widely discussed before. Based on the recommendation of some of the readers I bought this book only to find it superficial. The stories are cluttered and unorganised. The entire book nearly consists of stories of how other people feel and just a short analysis of the author's opinion. I found this book to lack depth of analysis and boring. I lost interest halfway through the book because all it did was talk about other people's problems without proper analysis which made me feel worse than I had when I brought the book. A real disappointment. Do yourself a favour. Skip this one.
1,schadenfreude and the need for solutions,"So, this book does ONE really good thing: it puts the quarterlife crisis on the map. It tells us what we know and gives us a word to use against those who still think the twenties are roaring.BUT it does not offer solutions. Neither does the sequel. I wanted this book to be better than it is.Instead, I would go for a book that offers a range of solutions--in a funny, practical way. 'Get It Together: Surviving your Quarterlife Crisis' by Damian Barr does just what it promises to. Helps you get through your quarterlife crisis. It looks at property, money, relationships and work. We hear from lots of different people--some smart, some not-so-smart. All interesting. I thought the stuff about 'money' was the best--I don't know about you but my friends are more likely to talk about sex and relationships than money matters.Read it. And don't weep."
2,Good if you are in your twenties,"I had to read this book for a class. Overall, it felt like the kind of book a person will enjoy and find interesting if he or she is just out of college and going through the ""quarterlife crisis."" Otherwise, it seems too intent in demonstrating the existence and the characteristics of such a crisis. The book is composed mostly by excerpts from the interviewees, with few comments from the authors. If I didn't have to read it for the class I wouldn't have finished it, and I love to read almost any book."
3,Too Many Perspectives,"Although I appreciate the authors' time and effort in compiling so many people's opinions, I found the ideas too divergent. They presented points of view that I never considered (and don't care to consider). I picked this book up expecting some answers or suggestions, not more opinions, questions, and confusion!"
3,Not What I Thought,"Written by two women in their twenties, I have mixed emotions about this book. Overall, I think it is an interesting read. It touches on a lot of the issues twenty-somethings deal with (first job, first long-term romance, etc.). It seems that a large portion of the book is made up of personal experiences (i.e., ""Sue, 25, a graduate of Cornell Univ. says that she.."") which is always helpful. What I found lacking was information about handling financial issues - how to cope with rent, bills, and insurance. It also seems like the book is written purely from the perspective of someone in their twenties who graduated from college (and graduated in 4 years right after high school) which as we know is not always the case."
1,gobblygook deluxe...,"I had the misfortune to come across this little tome while I was finishing the excellent ""Ghost Soldiers"" by Hampton Sides, and all I can say is this: I beg and plead with you not to waste your money on this astoundingly self-absorbed screed, unless you need further evidence as to how the seemingly ever-growing legions of spoiled whiners are acting as an anchor around the neck of Western civilization. The only reason I gave this waste of tree a single star is because I'm unable to grade it with an negative number, as far as I can tell...."
1,Dealing with normal life issues isn't a crisis,Quarterlife crisis? The only crisis is how self-absorbed and self-entitled this group of 20-somethings shows themselves to be. They should stop looking for crises and get a life.
1,meh...,"I bought this book because I'd read and enjoyed some of Alexandra Robbins' others. But man, was this one boring. Slow moving. Repetitive. You get the picture. I couldn't even finish it. Of course, for a book airing the views of twentysomethings, I guess I shouldn't have been expecting dazzling insights or anything. As an age group, judging from this book, it appears we don't really have much to say for ourselves, sigh. The sorority one and the Yale secret society one were much more interesting."
3,Misses the mark just a bit,"This book is OK, it's not as good as Dave Egger's book ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius"" or Pat Ortman's self-titled CD ""Pat Ortman"" in defining 20something angst in America during a time of political and social inertia. I think at times it came off as a bit whiny. Still, worth a read. I""d also recommend ""13th Generation"" as a book that goes much more in depth than this one."
2,Quarterlife Crisis with no answers...,"While its wonderful to know that others go through the same trials and tribulations, this is a work that, for me, went no where. No suggestions are made on how to improve a situtation. Rather, the book shows that others are facing many of the same challenges. Some are resolved, others are left wide open with no sense of closure. This book is a waste of time."
1,Not worth the time or money,"This book tries to sell itself as a sef-help book for twenty-somethings. It is really just a collection of brief descriptions of other people's problems. These little tidbits aren't even interesting. I kept waiting for something of substance, but it never came.Let me save you the time and money and sum it all up with this sentence...Whatever doubts, problems, tough decisions, etc. you may have as a twenty-something, know this, you are not alone. End."
1,Green advice: loud-mouthed and wet behind the ears,"I bought a book a few years ago called The Go-Girl Guide to Surviving her 20's; the notion that this is a novel issue is simply wrong. Oprah made a good move when she stepped away from the book club... Anyway, I prefered the Go-Girl Guide, save its tremendously less sophisticated title, because the author has actually SURVIVED her 20's and lived to talk about it. The authors of this book haven't gotten through it all just yet. Furthermore, any 20-somethings that are ""together"" enough to give seminars and train other 20-somethings to be ""together"" obviously couldn't truly understand what it is like to be confused and tormented. This book is ambitious in the most sarcastic usage of the word: precocious and inappropriately condescending."
3,maybe it's not a crisis,"these gals define a concept but life in your 20s isn't always a crisis. i wanted society to pay attention to the hardships of life in your 20s, but now i feel bad for all the 20-somethings who are pegged as overindulgent whiners."
3,There's been better,"This book is So-so. I wrote my thesis on Emerging adulthood, and I think this is an interesting book. You should read it if you really want to know more about college students transitioning into adulthood. But there are other books that do the same thing, and a little bit better. But it's in layman's terms, and very readable. It didn't rock the world, but It's a decent read."
2,How could she know?,"I have another book, The Go-Girl Guide to Surviving Her 20's, that I have really enjoyed; so the advertisements about this being a new idea are just inaccurate. I prefered the Go-Girl Guide, save its tremendously less-sophisticated title, b/c the author of that book has actually SURVIVED her 20's. The authors of this book haven't gotten through it all yet. Furthermore, any 20-something that is ""together"" enough to teach other 20-somethings how to be ""together"" couldn't possibly really understand what it's like to be confused and tormented."
3,Helpful but not wonderful.,"This book definately made life seem more hopeful and made me feel normal (knowing I'm not the only one freaking out). I felt a little glimmer of hope when done reading it, knowing that its not THAT scary in the real world (as long as you pay your bills), but I still was a bit confused about where I stand and where to go from here... then again, how can anyone know these things?"
3,A semi-interesting read...,"The underlying concept of the quarterlife crisis is an interesting and relevant issue for many people in their twenties. The main drawback of the book, however, is in its lack of organisation. The book is filled with personal accounts and stories of ""quarterlifers"" that just drag on and on.The book mainly focuses on the obstacles surrounding careers and entering the ""adult world"" and I would have found the book more enjoyable if it looked more closely at some other issues (e.g., relationships, identity).Overall, the book is much like sitting with a group of other folks and listening to their stories. The stories, however, become quite boring as the same theme just keeps coming through. Perhaps if the author brought more focus into their book, it would have been more enlightening to read."
4,Stories I Can Relate To,"It is about time that someone realized the crisis that twentysomethings are going through, myself included. I felt so much better after reading this book, because in some of the many stories told by twentysomethings all over, I could see the very same things I have been through or am going through. This was a very informative read. The one thing missing would be more advice. The stories themselves will let you know that you are not the only person going through this crisis, and that it is just a normal phase of most twentysomething lives. However, if the authors would have given more advice, rather than comments on each of the stories told, the book would have been even better. This is overall a great read that all twentysomethings should read."
2,CONQUERING YOUR QUARTERLIFE CRISIS IS BETTER,This book didn't do anything for me. There weren't any solutions. Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis is the sequel which had solutions that were helpful so I would recommend that one instead.
2,No useful advice,"If you had no idea that the so-called quarterlife crisis existed and simply wanted to know that others are in your shoes, this book could be good for you.If you knew about it, but wanted to read about others' experiences, you may enjoy this book.If you wanted actual constructive advice about what to do and how to handle things that come up during this time of your life, this book will not be useful. It's like the author simply interviewed 20-somethings and wanted to use every quote she got in her book, but never really thought it out beyond arranging the quotes into sensical chapters. There's not really any useful advice for anyone going through their quarterlife crisis, which may be a tall order considering most people would probably experience it differently, but I really was disappointed by the book."
1,Go talk to your friends instead...,"Yawn. Tell me something i don't already know. Reads like a college thesis -- thesis statement, conclusion, and 180 pages of supporting quotes in between. Let me save you some time: the twenties can be a challenging time because of the amount of major life changes post college. Yadda yadda. Doesn't tell you what to DO about it."
2,Don't spend the money,"Don't spend you money on this one. Instead, spend it on drinks with your friends while discussing the trials and tribulations of being a twenty-something. I was very disappointed with this book. Having read an article on the two authors in the newspaper, I ran to the book store. (I was a fool to think that a book could give me all the answers to this part of my life.) After reading 3 chapters I was bored! Everything I got out of it I could have gotten from friends going through the same thing! I felt like the authors were going around in a circle and stating the same things over and over again. Here's a quick summary....Everyone goes through changes when you are transitioning into another part of life. It's normal, and all you need to do is talk with people that are, or have been through the same thing!"
1,and i thought i had problems,"its true what other reviews are saying about catering to the ivy league the economy's-not-as-good-as-daddy-promised crowd. plus its stupid. i mean i know everything's relative, but it talks down to the reader like the friend of a friend at a party counselors these two ladies are. if i need useless, generalized advice about why my life isn't going like i thought it was when i was 18, i'll talk to my friends who finished grad school for the privilege of working the coffee bar and Barnes and Noble."
2,"Good Pictures, Poor Vocabulary","I bought this book to help me communicate with my 22-month old daughter, who doesn't verbalize much yet but uses signs quite well. The pictures included with the signs are indeed helpful, but I have been very disappointed with the vocabulary included (or not included, as the case may be) in the book. There are no signs for please, thank you, more, again, sing, finished, diaper...lots of the words we use in our everyday life. It does have signs for things like embarrassed and jealous, which are concepts we're not going to get to for awhile."
3,not that useful,"I found this book to be a poor guide to learning beginning signs. It has no verbal directions for each sign, just a picture. And a lot of times, the picture is just inadequate. I think it would help most people to understand the signs much better with written descriptions alongside each picture."
4,Signing for children,I liek this book... it has simple signs placed in context with illustrations. The section of verbs has the best pictures to explain the sign/word. It is a great springboard toward teaching sign to children that have deaf freinds/classmates.
3,Not for me,"I thought this book would be good because of the title, but the illustrations were in black and white and hard to understand the hand movements. The book is very busy with an illustration to the side and then the sign on the other side- it is very distracting. I am a beginner and need something more simple with bigger pictures so I can really see how to do the sign."
5,Good book,"Good price, received product very quickly and the quality of product was better than expected. This was a good deal."
4,Nice sign language book for kids,"The book is easy to follow and the illustrations very attractive to kids, so they are eager to read and learn. It has the look of a coloring book, which kids love, also. The signs are for the most part accepted ASL signs. It has been very handy (have used to teach 3 children sign language)."
4,Richard Burton in Divorce His,"I had watched Divorce Hers first and liked it better, probably because I am female. I did enjoy the acting and the story line very much in Divorce His."
2,Thin,"This book is written by the same author as the Server+ All-in-One book, Stephen Bigelow. It is pretty much that book without all the useless pages of tables. It even has the same picture of the SCSI adapter labeled as a NIC.This book doesn't have much information on server environments, benchmarking, and troubleshooting. These subjects are definately covered on the examI'm not sure how anybody thinks that they can read this book and pass the very difficult Comptia Server+ exam. It is less than half the size of many of the other Server+ books."
2,A disappointment,"I'll admit that my expectations were modest for a book which would teach me DBase in a day, but this one still leaves a lot to be desired. The author does cover the basic components of DBase (tables, forms, etc). But the constant litany of ""look at DBase's excellent online explanation of this"" or ""look at DBase's help for instructions on how to do this"" wore thin very quickly, and several of the examples did not work as directed. Many times, directions were given to ""push x button"" or ""use y control"", with no picture or explanation of where to find said control. This book was clearly targeted for novice DBase users, but I certainly didn't feel I had learned much about using DBase after reading it."
3,"""The girl who could talk to dolls""","This is a fairly ordinary story of a little girl in an orphan home, the two kindly directors, a couple of pathetic dolls, and a mean old director. It's just puzzling why a 7-year-old would go out by herself on a snowy afternoon and not get even one harsh word when she gets brought home. Formulaic but a good quick read. A better story about getting lost is six-year-old Oliver's solo trip to the circus inThe Saturdays (The Melendy Quartet), and every story in Rumer Godden'sFour Dollsknocks this one off the mantle."
2,Dolls Talk to this Girl!,"What a delightful premise that dolls can ""speak"" to selected listeners (kids only, of course) even while adults are present. This results in natural dialogue confusion, since the grown ups remain clueless to these private conversations. This is a simple little tale of bonding between a little girl in an orphanage and two ""rejected"" charity dolls. Child and dolls work together to avert disaster on Christmas Eve: by providing each other the best presents--unconditional love and each other! This cute, short fantasy will appeal to elementary girls. York has captured the spirit of a kinder, gentler age in this charmer."
1,"Gluten-Free, really?",This product has barley flour in it so how can it be gluten-free? I get sick with even a minute amount of gluten in something so barley flour would not work for me. I wonder why of all the gluten-free flours out there this company chooses barley flour which is not gluten-free? I did some research on this and found that barley flour does contain gluten. Surely I am missing something here as to why this product is marketed as gluten-free. Perhaps the company can explain. The bars sound really good and I love strawberry.
1,Barley=Gluten,"Barley flour is not gluten-free flour. Please take it off the gluten-free list. I love shopping Amazon for gluten-free items in bulk. And, especially for packing lunches for kids who need gluten-free snack items. Please correct."
4,yummy,"pro: great quick snack for breakfast or on the go. Has that pastry type crust which my son likes.con: can be a little dry but ""real"" fruit bars like this are too!! Great for GF!"
5,I LOVE these bars; they are tasty and perfect breakfast food,"These are the best fruit bars; similar to fig newtons BUT much better. They are a good snack, or for a quick breakfast. Delicious. Bought on Amazon.com for a better price verses a individual sale in the store at 3 times the cost."
3,"meh, 2"" cookie not my idea of ""Jumbo""","These taste like a gluten-free strawberry fruit cookie. They are tiny. Maybe 2"" by 2"". I had the assumption (i.e. the ""Jumbo"" in the title)that they were more danish-like/4""x4"". They are a cookie, not cake and they have a lot of fruit spread in the middle. They are good, but 190 calories for a tiny cookie is not worth it to me."
2,stale,"I've had these before and they were good, this batch is stale. I can't see how to tell the seller other than here. The use by date is fine, the cookies are just stale. Disappointed."
3,These were just ok,These fruit bars were just ok for me.ibought then because I have sensitivities to milk and food coloring. I think I would like them more with less fruit and more cookie. They were awfully sweet and I love sweet stuff. I even put sesame butter on them thinking it would help but was still too sweet. They weren't bad just not what I was hoping for.
1,NOT Gluten Free!,"While this product is wheat-free, it is most definitely not gluten free. Please do not feed to those on a GF diet."
5,IT (IS) GLUTEN FREE!!!!!,"Amazon is wrong, checked there site and my box i just received they ARE gluten free there is NO barley in it.Check it.[...]"
3,OK but bulky,"This product works ok, but it is much bulkier than it needs to be. There's a lot of empty space between the sides, which seems to serve no purpose. Some of that space could have been used to include an extra key. Seems to be well made. A bit pricy."
5,True 3X Extreme Cord,"After 4 years of securing hundreds of pounds to 4-wheeler racks over logging trails and through swamps, original 3X 40"" cords are getting frayed. The hook shape is still intact and the hook-cord connection is secure, but occasional rough equipment edges fray the cord. I recently purchased backup replacements because nothing else comes close. 40"" stretches to only 53"" with 10 lb weight. Cords from Home Depot, Lowe's, and hardware stores that I have checked are wimpy compared to these manufactured by Cequent under the name Highland."
3,It works OK,"It does the job, but it's noisy. I actually rocks very rapidly when it heats up. Also the spout could have been designed better. It splatters when it pours."
3,Time to take a break from the series,"While the series itself as been enjoyable, this volume is, to paraphrase the author's afterword, simply a continuation of book 3 and should really be considered to be book 3, part 2, rather than book 4. Given this, there is relatively little work on characterization or background or, to a fair extent, plot. It is a description of three battles/situations involving the folks in the battlesuits, the SheVa ""Bun Bun"" and Cally O'Neal and a few others. Unfortunately, the first of these three more or less becomes a matter of attrition and therefore none too exciting. The overall feeling is one of getting the characters and the plot to a certain point so that the author can take a well-deserved rest for a while.I cannot recommend this for anyone starting out on the series, but folks who have read the first three volumes will read this one no matter what the reviews are like."
4,A Well-Executed Conclusion,"Hell's Faire was meant to be part of When the Devil Dances and essentially is the missing end chapters of that third book in the Posleen War series. The author has a good reason for this anomaly in what should have been a trilogy and this knowledge explains a lot and also eases the frustration I felt after completing When the Devil Dances.In Hell's Faire, the plot is neatly completed (or at least advanced in preparation for future books) and Ringo's writing is, as ever, highly enjoyable. The characters, the battles and the plot are all well rendered and engrossing."
4,A fine addition to the series,"I know exactly what I liked about this book over the earlier ones...the focus wasn't on superhero Mike Oneal. No, the focus was on Bun-Bun, the superhero mechanized cannon\assault vehicle! And while superheroics were still present, there were real people involved as well. I guess that's just my preference.Overall, this is a great wrap-up to the posleen invasion phase of the series. As usual, the combat sequences are vividly portrayed and just a ton of fun."
4,Hard to put it down,"I waited several extra months for this one, we pass the book around work. All of the folks complaining about John splitting the 3rd book SHUT UP. The events that caused him to alter his trilogy are not his fault.He did an outstanding job of continuing the story, and the good news is there will be more. Even when bub-bun is in the rear the pace keeps up. All this time these stories were just to wet our appetite for more. I can't wait! Hope there is more destruction for evil alien races. Semper Fi !"
2,Deux ex machina indeed,"""The biggest complaint I have is the deus ex machina saviors . . . ""Sums it up for me. I have refused to buy or read anything else in the series because of that ending.Sorry, John, but there has to be some penalty. Readers had a lot invested in the series by that point. It was great until then but that just makes what felt like a betrayal even worse, whatever the reason.I can't think of many books in the enormous numbers I have read that left me feeling this, well, cheated.I originally read the ending with growing disbelief. It felt just as if, a few chapters from the end of a very long book in a long series, that the publisher had called and told the author that the fifth book was a no-go and this one had to end the whole story (and was still due in his hands in a couple of days)."
2,A story full of cardboard characters and stupidity,"Once again we are dished up a book full of characters without depth, plotting that consists of alternating stupidity and massive battles, and a conflict without any interesting twists or surprizes. The one aspect that makes this book superior to the previous tomes is that it is significantly shorter (hence the two stars). Ringo writes passable battle narrative, but the complete lack of realistic and interesting characters makes the outcomes irrelevant. When you don't care about the characters, you don't care if they live or die.I had hope for the series after the first book, but instead of the author developping as a writer, he has been pumping out formula stories that have gotten worse, not better with each release.This is one franchise that is dead and should have been buried long ago."
2,Take this book. Please.,"Well, it's a good guide for people who are absolutely clueless to the RPG world, or who are having a really hard time with FFT. However, this book is anything but ""ultimate"". It doesn't even mention the Deep Dungeon scenario, has no maps whatsoever, and is inaccurate in many places (Summoners equipping katanas?). Save your money and look for FAQs and Walkthrus on the Internet, or buy to official guide put out by Prima, which is much better."
5,Rabbit Calendar 2005,"We own 3 rabbits, and we get this calendar every year. The pictures are well done, and the calendar is of high quality. If you love rabbits, this calendar is for you."
5,top notch psych thriller,"A prominent aerospace engineering genius is about to have brain surgery, but ends up dead on the sidewalk in front of the hospital in the wee hours of the morning. Soon, another dead body appears who has a connection to the first. Was the first a murder and the second a suicide from the guilty party? Or were they both suicides, or both murders? Our hero, a psychiatrist working for the police, unravels the twisted relationships of several people involved in the two lives, and finally delivers a whodunnit showdown that amazed me. This book reads very quickly."
2,Mainstream Fails--------A Thriller It's Not,I've all the author's books in this series and until I read this one I really enjoyed every one. This one read like the author decided to write a mainstream mystery novel and to make the protagonist your normal psychiatrist. The cutting edge writing that made the other books great is totally absent. Here's hoping Dr. Ablow will abandon this approach and return to writing truly exciting psychological thrillers.
2,Don't read this after reading Child or Pelecanos,"Apparently I'm in a minority but, yawn, it was so tedious. I found the descriptions of where 'we were' to be sparse, almost nonexistent. Maybe they're in other novels. Boston is a helluva city. Read Spenser. Boston is like a fifth character, another subplot. You're there, man.One reviewer commented that Clevenger appeared to be on the phone all the time. That was my read as well.I recognize that Kellerman and White have made the forensic psychiatric murder milieu a virtual cottage industry. Maybe that's my problem. I don't get into it. Seems too unbelivable. All those patients. All those murders. Whatever.So my take was it was tedious, I didn't ""feel"" the environment, and I found the tricking of guilty people to be, incredible. As in not credible. 2 stars. Larry Scantlebury"
1,"Bootleg, pure and simple","Frankly stated, the 'official' review is full of ... This is no 1966 concert - merely cuts from the Capital 1964 BEACH BOYS CONCERT CD, with the songs cut and pasted in a different order to appear different. I thought Amazon had a policy against bootleg material - do your homework, guys!"
4,great book,"This was excellent! I enjoy watching Catherine Crier on courttv so I had high expectations for this book, and it did not disappoint me."
3,Dissapointed,THis book is just ok. With all the dynamics and chararters I think the author could of done a much better job. I really enjoyed her book that she wrote on Scott Peterson. In Final Analysis the book repeats its self over and over.
3,Author adds her own psychiatric 2 cents,"Similar to Keith Ablow (who wrote the forward), Crier adds her own opinion about the psychology of both the victim and the perpetrator. Her facts should stand by themselves without her weaving in tidbits similar to ""this relationship was a perfect storm of neuroses and it was inevitable that Susan would kill her husband, thinking she was actually getting back at her father, who abused her....""I wonder who proofread this book. Sloppy editing abounds - from small things such as spelling Goodwill (the store) as Good Will and Sony PlayStation as Play Station. There's also a 16-year-old who commits murder and two weeks later, ""celebrates his 18th birthday."" What happened to his 17th year? Did he lose one for committing murder?"
2,Tedious,"Too long, boring, uninteresting, tedious. I could be 200 pages shorter and still not be worthy of being read. Don't bother."
1,Ho Hum,"Ho Hum! Even a mediocre cook should be able to create a masterpiece with the right ingredients and a few good spices. This case had nothing but the best - but Crier served up a formulaic stew -- overcooked and without the spice. Forget this one -- unless you want a cure for insomnia.Read Carol Pogash's book on the same case -- ""Seduced by Madness"" She captures the characters and the family dynamics that underlie the Polk tragedy. Believe me, the victim was once a close friend and I know the back-story and most of the cast of characters. Pogash got it right - she writes like a gourmet -- the book will make your mouth water."
5,A man bridges a gap with his children...,"Jon Voight plays a divorced father of three, who rarely sees his kids, remembers their birthdays, and generally isn't much of a parent. The role of parent to the kids belongs to his beautiful ex-wife, played by Millie Perkins, and her current husband, a loving man played by Richard Crenna. Voight arrives to take his children on their yearly vacation together, and it turns out to be a Mediterranean cruise. During the cruise, the love he has for his kids is evident as well as the unfamiliarity he has with playing the father and putting his kids first. But when a tragedy strikes back home, Voight must decide if taking on the role of father permanently is something he can and wants to do..."
4,Table for Five,Great movie! Shows what could happen when an absent father tries to connect with his kids after being consistently disconnected from them for a certain period of time; what a mother's needs are and how a stepfather's love can provide stability in the family. Lots of lessons to be learned in this movie.
5,Great Movie,Jon Voight does it again. A movie that brings tears to your eyes as a father who tries to bond with his kids by taking them on a cruise. A very touching movie that'll touch your heart.
5,Personal favorite,"I never tire of watching this movie. I think it is Jon Voight's finest acting part. Even greater than what he did in ""Coming Home"" and ""Midnight Cowboy."" But what is really special about this movie are the children, especially Roxanne Zal. What a lot of people do not know is that she holds the honor of being the youngest Emmy winner on primetime TV in ""Something about Amelia"". The scene in the movie where Jon Voight has to tell the children about the death of their mother is a scene you can never forget."
3,Not a bad throwback,"I found out about the Concretes due to the former lead singer, Victoria Bergsmann. She's the one from ""Young Folks"" by Peter Bjorn and John, who's new band is Taken By Trees. I purchased this album used for $4, resold it for $3, and saved 4 songs off of the album. Not bad for a buck. The band reminds me of the softer, smoother side of Velvet Underground. Very nice instrumental sections, soft vocals, etc. Say Something New, You Can't Hurry Love, Diana Ross, and Seems Fine are the standouts. If you're into a smooth, cohesive albuum, without obviously forced songs, this is a good place to turn to. Recommended for fans of Velvet Underground, Nick Drake, Feist... also if you like them, check out Arthur & Yu (In Camera)."
1,You'd be better off listening to actual concrete,"The problem with this band is their style is really boring. Too mellow, just a bunch of drums and soft whiny lyrics without any real pizzazz. The singer is annoying also, but more annoying on this CD than she is on the newest release ""In Colour"", which isn't quite as bad; it's a step forward if nothing else. Anyway, this is a CD full of dull music except for maybe the first song. Don't buy it."
1,Are you people serious?,Good God! Are you people serious about this group having any musical ability at all? They are by far the worst off key out of tune bunch of nincompoops that I have ever had the displeasure of hearing. The Target ad is an abombination. I could not actually believe that they were for real and had made several CD's. They really SUCK!!! It's as if Yoko Ono has been reborn.
5,Great battery pack,Very good value for the quality for a good price. I have had this backup batter for about3 months and it is doing the job.
5,I would buy this again.,Too many times I ran out of battery power so I decided to spring for 2 packs. Best priceI could find for a quality battery and having matched batteries in my battery grip is amust.
1,Didn't work,"This battery did not work in our camera. It fit. It charged, but it did not work in the camera."
1,"Lasted less than 6 months, with sporadic use","Brought this battery in July, it's now January and completely DOA when I went to use it for a photo shoot. I've only used it about 8-10 times since purchasing it."
1,Didn;t work,The charger shows charge but battery doesn't hold it. I could not contact the manufacturer because it got mixed in with my 2 older batteries from the original camera and it was not fair for me to ask for replacement when I can;t prove which on was from seller.
1,Device failed when used in China.,"The first time I plugged in the battery charger in China I heard a pop and the charge light went out. It seemed to work so I continued trying to use it, but after a few days it had completely failed. I have returned it, but ended up having to pay for the return postage. This is a thumbs-down."
4,Good Buy,"I've only used the battery once, but it's definitely worth the money. Since you can buy three or four of these for the price of a Canon brand battery. It keeps the charge well, and seems to last as long as the Canon one does. Overall a good buy."
1,WASTE OF MONEY! INFERIOR PRODUCT!,WASTE OF MONEY! INFERIOR PRODUCT!thought i'd chance getting this product even though it received a number of bad reviews because the good reviews seemed to outweigh the bad ones. BIG MISTAKE! i purchased 2 of these batteries. they don't even last as long as other old batteries i've had for years.i shoot photographs for hours at a time. the new STK batteries last 2-3 hours. THEY ARE VERY POOR QUALITY.DEFINITELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.asked for a refund from amazon.
5,Last long on one charge,After using my original Canon battery for up to two years it wouldn't hold a single charge for even half a day. So I opted for this purchase. So far after one charge it has held its charge for almost a week now with light use daily. Very happy with this purchase. Thank you!
1,Total Dissapointment,I purchased two of these batteries and they will hold a charge for about 10 minutes. Not a very good buy.
1,Not worth the low price paid. I might as well have throw money in the fire.,This battery lasts about 5 pictures on a full charge. I contacted the seller and didn't receive a reply.
3,powershotjim,The specification listed the mah as 1200 but when the item was received they sent me a 700 mah. They should not mislead you into buying a better product than they offer.
1,Poor Quality control or bad product?,"The batteries I recieved didn't have any kind of marking on them, except that they said 'For Canon NB2LH'. No power rating, nothing.Nevertheless, both the batteries I bought last LESS than the canon originals. Much lesser. Now this is not what they advertised, right? Bad, bad, bad."
1,It's just a battery,"There seems to be some variety as to the specific mAh of the batteries supplied. I received a lesser one but the vendor I selected, SFplanet, was apologetic and made sure the situation was properly resolved.You can't edit the stars, but I'd bump it up to a 3. No more though, it is after all just a battery."
1,battery for my Canon VIXIA,Battery doesn't work. Total waste of money! I've always thought SterlingTEK had good knock-off batteries until I encountered this. Now I have to buy the genuine OEM battery.
3,Shipping ????,"$7.98 shipping for ONE battery?? That's where the rip-off is, not the battery. However, the seller cannot .. or will not .. reveal what the actual MAH value is."
5,Great Value,"This battery compares well with Canon OEM. Battery fits my camera well, charges quickly,and holds the charge well. Great value, much cheaper than OEM from Canon."
5,The Best Accessory for a Canon Vixia,"It's very easy to fully discharge a camcorder battery in < 1 day. This spare battery isgreat to have and I used it a lot. Alternating between this battery and the Canonbattery, I can't tell a difference in the battery life on a single charge. I haven'thad it long enough to evaluate long term, but comparing the price difference the two,I could buy 3 or 4 of these for 1 Canon battery."
1,Undrinkable Endurox R4,"I have been drinking vanilla Endurox R4 for over 5 years and this is NOT authentic Endurox or it is a bad batch. Twice I tried to drink it after work and ended up pouring it on the ground. I will order in the future from more reliable sellers although it may cost more. I was swayed by this seller's cheap price. If it sounds to good to be true, it probably is."
4,Endurox R4 recovery drink,I bought this product as I was starting a new high intensity regime lasting 6 days of the week and I didnt want to burn myself out. It does what it says on the box. Aids recovery after strenuous exercise... especially in the half hour prior to the workout as this is when your muscles absorb most nutrients and vitamins to aid recovery. The Lemon and Lime flavour is nice. Its not salty tasting like some other recovery drinks. All in all its pretty refreshing after an hour or two at the gym.
1,Disappointed!,"I have used Endurox R4 before and thought it was a very good product. Amazon's information (ingredients) is old. They now use soy protein in this product. If you avoid soy, you need to know this. Hopefully, Amazon will update the page. I was very disappointed when I received the new version. Amazon does a great job in accepting returns, so this product is going back."
4,Endurox R4 Lemon Lime,"Long time Endurox user, although I usually buy the orange flavor. Tried lemon/lime for a change- tasts is fine, not too strong or sweet. Great for a long run recovery drink."
5,Awesome recovery drink,"I have used this recovery drink for years. I try not to take it unless I am doing something intense that lasts over an hour. I usually take it when I do long runs or tri training. It works like a charm. I did 10.5 miles yesterday (my longest run this season has been 6 miles), took some R4 post run and feel no soreness today. I am definitely going to continue using this product. I havent used any other products outside of Gatorade and protein shakes so I can't really compare it. However, this product does what it is designed to do."
5,Wow!,"This is exquisite live jazz by two of the greats at their peak.Both disciples of Lennie Tristano, but each with their own unique sound, as it should be. Live at the Vanguard.This is Bebop reworked and made even more harmonically inventive, melodically beautiful, and perhaps less rhythmically complex.Easy on the ears, but interesting for the brain."
5,excellent sarong!,"Vibrant colors, makes a great cover for an old lounge chair! Excellent quality. Very pleased!""Blue Celtic Circle Knot"" 44"" X 66"" Sarong"
1,DO NOT SUPPORT COPY PROTECTED CDS,"Idlewild is a great band, and from I've heard so far I love this album. But, I will be buying the EMI import WITHOUT the COPY PROTECTION. I don't carry expensive original cds in my car - I make cdr copies because in the car it is easy (inevitible) to scratch a cd. Amazon's description of a COPY PROTECTED disk states that it may not play in car cd players. I listen to cds more in my car than I do at home. BOYCOTT COPY PROTECTION NOW!"
1,Capitol needs to be sued as well,"How does the new Idlewild album sound? I couldn't tell you. I received my copy today and tried it on 4 different cd players and the thing did not work on any of them. Not only is this a copy-protected cd, but it's a listen-protected cd as well. Thanks, Capitol!"
1,PROTECTED from too much!,"I was, yet another, scammed by this copy protection. Close to 10 different CD players including mine, friends, families, as well as my computer could not get this thing to play.What's the point? Great CD... I have heard the non-copy protected, but... BUYER BEWARE!"
2,stupid copy protection,"i also ordered this through bmg and could not get the darn disk to work on any of my stereos, i ended up throwing it out and downloading the songs from a site that they're probably trying to keep me from using in the first place.the songs are good, but not as good as ""the remote part"". if you don't have any of idlewild's disks get ""the remote part"", i wouldn't buy this disk at any price.f.y.i. dave atell's cd ""shanks for the memories"" also has copy protections on it so you can't download it the computor or ipod - avoid. there should be a site with a list of all cds with copy protections on them that don't allow you to download the songs to your computor/ipod, i would gladly never buy any cd with those protections."
3,A pretty lazy effort by a good band - this is an extremely cheesy albeit somewhat likable album,"Idlewild is not a bad band. If you've heard their previous album, ""The Remote Part"", then you would know this. The problem with ""Warnings/Promises"" is that these songs, while catchy, aren't deep or interesting, and they're just incredibly cheesy (and are guilty pleasures). You'll definitely agree that the first three songs are very catchy and the best here, but these are the kind of songs that MTV would play alongside the new Britney Spears album. The saving grace for the band is that at least every song is catchy and ""decent"". Singer Roddy Woomble isn't as likable as he was on ""The Remote Part"" for some reason. Musically this is just straight-up pop rock that sounds like every other band you've ever heard on MTV. A disappointing effort that's at least not completely horrible. Not recommended.Highlights include:everything is ""ok"""
2,Not a breakout album,"In my opinion, this CD is not very good. I'm a big fan of Idlewild's two previous albums (100 Broken Windows and In Remote Part), but this is such a departure into folk rock that it's a whole different band. Unfortunately, there are other bands that do folk rock a whole lot better, my favorites being Rilo Kiley and Aimee Mann. I even tried listening to the CD 5-6 times to see if it would grow on me, but it doesn't. I just don't like it. I think this CD will mostly alienate old fans and not interest new ones."
2,Eh.,"This is what I call ""institutional"" big band music. The musicians are all very professional, they can read the charts and get all the notes in the right places, and it's all very uninvolving. The music doesn't swing. What more need I say?"
4,Just what I wanted it,"I was unable to find smaller and thicker wine glasses in our local stores. So, I ordered these glasses online, and they are just what I wanted: small and sturdy wine glasses.The only negative was that I had to buy a case."
5,REMARKABLE,"What's Your Shrine is by far one the best mastered, beautifully executed recordings I have ever heard. I've listened to this album thousands of times, and I still really enjoy the enormous patience, detail and love that Stephane Novac put into this album. My only complaint is that Pilgrims of the Mind hasn't made any other full length records!!!"
5,The 2004 Booster Tins continuation...,"I got an Insect Queen tin and I pulled out the following below.Pharaonic Guardian: Gora TurtleMagician's Force: Z Metal TankDark Crisis: Archfiend SoldierInvasion of Chaos: Mad Dog of DarknessAncient Sanctuary: Soul ResurrectionLike I said before, buy this. You will be surprised."
1,Yugioh tins,"I bought a Blue eyes tin not to long ago... I was hoping to get a holographic card like jinzo in at least 1 of the packs but that didn't happen. I didn't really get any good cards, and they tins aren't really that durable either, it can easily be crused by using your bare hands. The tins use to have 5 of a certain pack in them, but now there's one of each. It's good for keeping your cards in, but I wouldn't recommend it. I really have expected more from the yugioh tins. :("
2,Hey...,"Whoever that was who told me I was dumb, I think you're stupid too. I don't really think much dumb of the original manga, but now we have five-and-six year olds into YU-GI-OH (Really, why is that name cool?), as like the craze that pokemon spawned nearly a decade ago... and then pokemon began to stink. It's just not really a cool anime. There are cooler animes than this, like dragon ball. These animes just don't FORCE you to buy every merchandise on shelves. Anyway YU-GI-OH isn't cool. Long live Homestar Runner and Commander Keen! And the NES! Now THOSE are awesome!"
2,Card Game with a STUPID NAME?,"For one thing, I hate Yu-Gi-Oh! The TV show is even dumber, and probably the cause of how stupid it is. Seriously, does YU-GI-OH!!!!! really sound like a cool game name? Though lots of older kids and adults like this game, I wish youg kids today would get into what was cool a decade ago... Lots of attempts to remake old shows are really [...]. (I HATE the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). I just hope it doesn't become one of those things like pokemon, where it's popular, and then it becomes so overrated that nobody likes it anymore. When I become a parent, I am going to introduce my kids to what I was into when I was little. My name is Andrew and I'm 11 years old."
1,read this b4 purchasing any yu-gi-oh items or games,"ok well first of all if you or the person u r shopping for is over 5 years of age then x out of this screen right now. this t.v show is so stupid, it teaches kids that when you are in trouble pull out some cards and battle. how exactly would that come in handy in real life?! (...) don't get this, unless you or your friend/child/relative wants to ruin their social life forever. thank you and have a great day. :)"
3,GREAT JOB AMAZON,"I don't know how many times I've seen other websites or WAL-MART or some other store dramatically spike the prices on these things! At my WAL-MART they cost $30! I also went to another website selling the God cards for $120 each! What people take advantage of to make a buck blows my mind! I mean the cards probably only cost two cents to make for Konami, and the price just escalates from there. Also, those so-called ""rare"" cards aren't really rare. The card company can crank out as many of the ""good cards"" as they want. I wouldn't suggest falling for the Yu-Gi-Oh fad, unless you want to go into debt really fast. But, if you are seriously into the game and want to compete, I suggest buying cards from here because not only has amazon brought the cost down to $20, they brought it down even further! GO AMAZON!! YOU GUYS ROCK!!"
2,There are better options available,"This book is okay. It does contain a lot of information, but the line drawings are tough to interpret and the selection of mammal bones shown is limited. There are three much better options available. All three use pictures, which are much easier to interpret and cover a much wider variety of mammals. Animal Skulls by Mark Elbroch is limited to skulls, but a very wide range of skulls is covered in incredible detail, a masterpiece, but limited to skulls. Comparative Osteology by Adams & Crabtree shows photos on a black background with somewhat difficult to read scales, and covers the major bones for a select group of mammals. My favorite is Mammalian Osteology by B. Miles Gilbert with photos of bones against a white background, with all major bones for a wide range of mammals shown."
1,What went wrong?,"The first season had a great story, characters and the lead heroine is an example of excellent role model. The show was just brilliant, had a sense of adventure and was a pure joy to watch.This second season is none of these things, rent it or borrow it from someone, but do not buy it."
5,Kaleido Star,"So I bought this for my sister's birthday and she loved it! Great condition, loved the packaging it was well protected. =]"
4,Good Tank Battle Account,"This book was an enjoyable read covering, as the name implies, the two thunder runs into the city of Baghdad by the Army's 3rd Infantry Division. The strong point of this book in my opinion was that it integrated viewpoints of a large number of troops in that battle along with alternative viewpoints of some Iraqi military members and some of the American soldiers' family members back home. I felt the author did a pretty good job not bogging the reader down or confusing them despite the mixture of these different viewpoints. I also enjoyed the moments when the author dabbled into some of the soldier's thoughts on killing. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about the thunder runs themselves or anyone with an interest in tanks"
5,non stop combat from start to finsh,"I have read many books on the Iraq war and david zucchino is one of the best. his detail on combat of the third ID puts you there with them in iraq.outstanding read, I was sorry it was over when I finshed the book!"
5,Outstanding book,You will not be able to put this book down until you finish. The actions described in the book were completely neglected by all of the media outlets. I had no idea of the intensity or severity of the battles that had taken place. The book is well written and never drags or bogs down in excessive terminology and unit descriptions as some other books of this nature tend to do. You will have an even more profound appreciation for our soldiers after reading this book. This is the best first hand account of a battle since Black Hawk Down.
5,Reads like a novel!,Thunder Run is as exciting as any fiction I've ever read. I salute the author's ability to report on hardcore combat without treating U. S. soldiers like butchers. Powerful and scary!
3,Iraq,"This book was extremely well written with lots of knowledge and insight into the fight for Baghdad. There was plenty of explanations and machine detail. However, I was disappointed in the the lack of a connection with any of the soldiers. I was hoping for more personal insight from the soldiers themselves. But if you're looking for an amazing war story, and not personal accounts/feelings, this book is great. If you like the personal accounts try Generation Kill. Great Book."
3,A Blizzard of Details,"I originally bought the hardcover edition for research purposes. It doesn't have the narrative flow of Rick Atkinson's ""An Army at Dawn"" and is a bit of a slog for the casual reader. However, there are many gems contained within, such as references to the Polish troops whose heroism was rewarded at the Yalta Conference by turning them over to the Russians after the war. There is little reference to the role played by the various air forces in both tactical and strategic support, and I found that disappointing. However, the assault on the Gothic Line is pretty well covered, and there is a blizzard of details on troop movements. The action is presented in a very dry, forthright manner. It depends more on official reports than on first hand accounts. I'd still buy it as a reference work, though another reviewer presents a good case for carefully checking other sources too."
3,Readable but flawed.,"The book is very detailed about the progress of the campaign. But there is a very serious mistake in the last page. Brooks writes that the town of Torbole was destroyed in a house to house battle. This is absolutely wrong, I lived practically next door and can assure you that Torbole survived unscathed. This throws into doubt all the rest of the book. Also there is no record among the population that any American soldiers were killed in tunnel # 5. But while dinamiting the road a contingent of German troops (actually they were from Bolzano)was decimated by a premature explosion and were laid to rest in a side chamber in one of the tunnels; the entrance was then bricked up."
5,Home for happy degus!,"We bought this to house our 5 male degus and I must say that they LOVE this little home! I must add that the little house, wheel, and plastic ladder are NOT to be left in the cage with degus. Degus chew like any other rodent, to wear down their continually growing teeth, but degus are VERY chewy, heh. The cage is easy to assemble and very easy to clean and aside from the degus chewing up everything, has held up very well. I'd recommend this product to a friend."
1,Just a comment....,"I just wanted to comment on some of the reviews and animals that are living in this cage (which I don't own)...degu's and rats in this cage? Degu's full grown are the size of softballs, and one person has 5 in this cage? I have 3 rats currently housed in a 4 level 32w x 18d x 36h cage, I wouldn't even use one this size for travel for a single rat. Just stating that this cage at 14 x 11 x 12 is not in any way appropriate for rats/degus or any animals of like size. Dwarf hamsters or mice are the only animals this cage will really house without stress on the animal."
1,"If you're four, you'll like them","These ear tips would be great for little kids dressing up for halloween, but if you are serious about LARPing or want to look genuine, these definitely aren't what you want!"
3,Elf Ear Tips - Lord of the Rings,"Prompt delivery. Ears were not rubbery as I would have expected. Rather, they were harder, thin, more plastic-like. The ears were only tips, NOT full ears and required a little work to have them stay in place. Double-sided tape, glue stick helped. Would have been better if some type of adhesive had been enclosed with the item."
4,ear tips,"I like these ear tips. They are not the same as the photo. They sit on the top part of the ear, held on by two sided tape. They stayed on with no problem at all. I did add a bit of makeup, just to make them blend in."
4,Wrong Picture for Item,This is the wrong picture for the item. They are just the tips. They are not very expensive. You really need special glue to attach to your ears as they have a tendency to fall off. I would have liked them to incorporate these in the wig somehow. They look cool. The seller got them here early and that was nice and they really offset the outfit. They look pretty real.
3,"Technical, full of useful information, a little boring in it's style","For a book on book design, it seems like the book itself would be more visually appealing. With that being said, the book has a lot of useful information and is superior to others in it's class. It covers several areas that I haven't seen in other books like Word vs Adobe Indesign, scanning pages, etc."
1,"Fun, but overall not enough to please...","It looks like fun at first glance, but the controls are just shoddy and unuseable to the point of making the game unplayable. If only you could re-map the controls to your liking, but nope! No wonder the game didn't sell well and was discontinued. Activision should be ashamed of not only this game, but themselves...The problem is, while the game is fun the controls make even the easiest of objectives a chore. Sheesh, I am still on the first mission only because to land without getting killed is near impossible. All in all, I would recommend Comanche 4 over this and can only hope a better heli sim is released soon."
1,GARBAGE....DON'T WASTE THE MONEY,"Buy Novalogic's Commanche instead. It is a real fun game and the helo flys really well and the missions are a blast. In Apache, the helo does not respond well at all and is a big piece of junk."
3,ATI Radeon X1600 512 Diaon Graphics Video Card,"Card works..however, color seems a little off when it is used.Not sure really what happened."
3,Interesting mix or recipes and stories,"The book is fun to read, and the author does an excellent job in relating her early family life in Italy to the recipes. Even if you don't use many of the recipes, it might be worth purchasing for the stories. However, the book loses one star because of its lack of photos. Some of the recipes can be difficult to prepare without knowing what the end product should look like. The author loses another star for raising my hackle in the way she expresses some of her opinions. In particular, she rants about all pasta salads, calling them ""unsuitable."" I completely disagree. If you are looking for a book on very traditional Abruzzesi food, proudly untouched by the last several decades, this is a good book. The author also writes about other regions a bit, which I thought was a nice touch."
1,"If you like Army rations, you'll love these!","Not sure what these are, but I'd like to have them carbon dated! Just like eating dried mud with some cement mixed in! What a struggle to eat! Heavy, like lead, and not at all close to those great Macadamia nut brownies that I should have reordered. On the bright side, I only have 17 more to go!"
2,Make Sure You Like Coconut,"This is the second flavor of Betty Lou's nut butter balls that I have tried -- the first was the Peanut Butter. Even though I am not a coconut person, I thought I would try these because they only have 150 calories versus 190 calories for the Peanut Butter Balls.Well, I don't like these at all -- they have an overwhelming coconut flavor. Reminds me of eating suntan lotion. However, if you are a coconut person, you might love them.I'll continue to work my way through the Betty Lou flavors until I find a favorite. I do think Betty Lou's are the perfect afternoon snack -- a relatively low-calorie, healthy snack that can keep you away from the junk food and tide you over until dinner."
3,taste bland,"i once had to eat survival bars for a survival class. That's what this tasted like not bad but bland and not eough coconut flavor, really chewy it's like the fiiler part of a candy bar (i wanted the sweet coconut and chocolate part) so=so it is what it is good for dieters and people who want chewy w/no sweet"
2,Didn't care for them,"They are kindof on the bland side, and I'd rather spend my calories elsewhere! But they are on the low-carb side.150 calories, 7g total fat (2g saturated), 8g sugar, 5g fiber, 1g sugar alcohol, 10g protein."
1,Icky icky icky yuck!,"I do apologize to all the people who like these, but I actually hate them! I'm not ultra picky, either, but these were beyond my ability to accept. They've got great texture and initially the flavor is good, but there's a NASTY chemical after taste that gets stronger with each chew. These are probably healthy, but I'd rather eat unhealthy food if it tastes better."
5,FANTASTIC!,"I've been gluten free for about three months, and as someone with a sweet tooth, I've been a bit bummed lately at the lack of easy and quick treats I can find or keep on hand.I went to the health food store and bought one of these individually to give it a try. I opened it in the car and almost went back in for more right then! Only the rain and a need to get on with my day held me back. I will most definitely be buying more.If you like macaroons, these are fairly similar, crunchy but chewy, soft, sweet and tasty."
5,"Healthy, Tasty, Chewy with Crunch",Great healthy food - great breakfast snack if on the go - good protein to carb ratio - highly recommend - Betty Lou is a real person with a real passion for creating healthy foods for her family - check out the Betty Lou website and see for yourself.
2,Not worth it,Try the spirulina nut balls. These are too artificial testing. Only eat them if I have no other food in the house.
5,History buffs and literature lovers must read,"Wright offers an insight in to abolition and the Civil War in this, should be, highly acclaimed novel about growing up in a free state and connection with relatives in the South while taking up arms against the racism and those who are fighting in part to perpetuate same. Characters are wonderful and offer lessons in tolerance."
4,Excellent book on context of Civil War,"The Amalgamation Polka by Stephen Wright starts out in the clouds of literary bluster, like the billowing smoke rolling across the battlefields in this imaginary tale of Civil War veteran Liberty Fish. Listening to the first chapter or several challenged my auditory mind to focus through the mushrooming cadences of adjectives and adverbs to find the storyline.But once I did, I was hooked on the vivid characters and riveting plot of an abolitionist finding his way through the bloody caldron of war to explore his slaveholding maternal roots, only to emerge from the experience a better man for it, and more resolved to the inalienable rights of all men.I highly recommend this enjoyable book. It is well worth the read."
2,too late or too early,I like the When to expect series for adults and that is why I have decided to buy this book. When I purchased it my daughter was 3 and my baby son 2 months. Many of the items in the book we have already explained to her on the day the baby came home from the hospital. The stories there are also too long for the toddlers attention.
4,Cute book,This book is very cute and gives a good overview for kids. It is geared towards younger kids though. Not exactly what you might want if you have a little bit older child.
3,For older kids,"I bought the book for my 3 yr old and it was just too old for her. Its a good book for older kids, but certainly not for toddlers."
4,Great Information!,I got this book for my 3 year old and I think it is great! It gives a lot of really good information that is on his level and I think it will really help a lot after I have the baby and bring her home. It is really helpful in preparing him for the changes that are about to happen and get us all talking about what we can expect. I am really glad that I ordered this book!!
3,Doesn't fit age group!,The recommened ages for this book are 2-5yrs but they really should be more like 4-8. There is far more text than any 2 year old would ever listen to. I had to reword and shorten the entire book for my 2 1/2 year old. Plus the information is way over the head of a 2 or 3 year old. Yes the book explains a lot about new babies but it just wasn't geared towards the age group they claim it to be.
4,Good but wordy,"This is a good book, but very wordy for young children. It explains things well, but you might have to skip a lot of the words and just describe the pictures."
3,Age Group Labeled Wrong,"The age group on this book should be more like 3 - 8 or even 4 -8. The recommended ages for this book are 2 - 5yrs, but there is loads more text than any 2 year old would ever listen to or understand. The information is way over the head of most 2 year olds and maybe even 3 year olds and very few pictures. The book is great at explaining a lot about new babies and would be a great book to have for siblings older than 4, but it is not geared towards the younger age group they claim it to be. This was a disappointment since my daughter is only 2 and at least my 2 year old needs more pictures and less words. I will have to do mucho ad libbing and shortening of this book....Thanks!"
3,WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN BABY COMES HOME,"THIS BOOK WAS A LITTLE TOO OLD FOR MY TODDLER GRANDSON TO UNDERSTAND. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE DONE IN A YOUNGER VERSION OF BABY WILL CRY AND YOU WILL SEE MOMMY AND DADDY PICK IT UP AND FEED OR CHANGE IT AND YOU CAN HELP, ETC. IT WAS TOO TECHNICAL TO ENJOY FOR A TODDLER."
2,A GOOD LIVE CD ALSO WITH 9 ORIGANAL RECORDINGS,"This cd is a good album if your looking for live recordings and original recordings, 1-20 songs are live witch he sings all his famous songs and 21-29 are original recordings with some great ones like mean eyed cat and hey porter sound quality is good."
2,A GOOD LIVE CD WITH 9 ORIGANAL RECORDINGS,"This cd is a good album if your looking for live recordings and original recordings, 1-20 songs are live witch he sings all his famous songs and 21-29 are original recordings with some great ones like mean eyed cat and hey porter sound quality is good."
4,pretty darn good,i think that it was a good story but could have used a little more unexpected surprises. overall the talking about teenage subjects was effective although it was slightly sugarcoated.~Maddie W
3,Kind of disappointed me!,"Mates, Dates, and MAd Mistakes kind of disappointed me because it ended where I think it should of begun. I love all of the other Mates/Dates books though. THis last last book also seemed to not really have a main idea. It talked about things from here, there, and everywhere. This is why I think Mates, Dates, and Mad Mistakes deserves 3 stars."
4,Good but not the best,"I enjoyed this novel for the most part but I've got to admit that it wasn't my favorite of Cathy Hopkins's books. It had an interesting premise and moved at a good pace but it just felt a little lackluster for some reason. (I definitely can relate to Izzie though.) In the end, there was too much preaching and philosphizing. Authors need to learn that sending a message about drugs, alcohol and sex to teenagers is best done sublty. Over all the book was pretty good."
4,The Title Says It All....,"Ahh, what can one say about one of the best songwriters out there? This is a wonderful collection of classic Chuch, solo and other side projects. I have never liked ""live"" albums: they always lack in audio quality and lose something in the translation..the beauty of live concerts is the party, not just the music. So although I have followed the Church & their solo projects for almost 20 (!!) years, I hesitated to buy this. Fear not, this is worth every penny. Close your eyes, and you'd swear that SK was in your home playing just for you. Good sound quality and good music- two thumbs up! ;] Now all I need is the video of the show..."
4,Is This The Taste Of Victory,"A definate must have for the collector who brags about having all things related to The Church. However, this is not for anyone outside that realm. I don't think you could just buy this cd without being a fan of Kilbey or The Church and say ""wow what a great cd."" The recording quality is excellent and it is very well produced, but Kilbey's performance is shotty and even weak in parts. Poor guitar playing and sketchy vox in some songs. It kind of seems like they put this cd and video together to get Kilbey's Karmic Hit Records off the ground and make a few bucks. I love The Church and Kilbey is a brilliant song writer and for that reason I give it 4 stars, but for a casual fan or discriminating consumer I would not recommend buying this cd."
1,very misleading title,"No real Chicago stepper would step off of any of these songs. the title would have you believe that there are real steppers songs that include songs like ""the ocean"" by K'Jon. I'm glad I listened first. Don't be fooled steppers. take a listen before you buy. I gave it one star, because it wouldn't accept ""0"" stars. lol."
4,Chasing this down after many years...,"I had thought about this book many times over the years. I haven't bothered to track it down, until my son (who is now 21) mentioned how much he remembered and loved the buckwheat pancakes that I made on Sundays. That recipe was from this book. He was a young kid, and this book made me turn away from margarine about 2 decades before it became ""known"". I made homemade cleaning products..and I remember there was a noodle recipe that came from whole wheat flour and yogurt..and that was IT. I just know that I first started going down healthier choices for my family, this was the one book where my family didn't gag at the recipes. And my son remembering how awesome the one pancake recipe was is making me re-order this, and even if some of it is outdated, I think the purchase is worth it."
4,"all foods contain ""chemicals""","Some contain HARMFUL chemicals like preservatives, dyes, and artificial flavors. Chemical like these should be reduced or eliminated from our diets. ALL foods have chemicals in them. Some are minerals, vitamins, proteins, flavors, acids, bases, salts, carbohydrates, oils, fats, etc. etc. etc. Stop branding all chemicals ""bad"". Even water (H2O), is a chemical."
2,Doesn't absorb enough,"These might be okay in the day, but the person wearing this product sleeps on his side and these just don't absorb properly. I would not recommend for nite use."
4,GREAT PRODUCT,"We are very please with this product for night time use. Previously we were using two pull-ons to do the work of what one Tranquilly Premium Overnight Pull-on does and having leakage problems, now no leakage either."
1,slow service,"Ordered these on the 11th of January and on the 14th, still haven't shipped. Won't be doing that again. Item was supposed to be in stock. From reading other reviews I expected quicker service and a fast turn around time."
3,They are pretty bulky.,They were so hard and bulky couldn't wear them. They may be alright if you stay on your back and dont move.
4,I like it,These work better than over the counter ones I found for my elderly parent. The product took a day longer to arrive then estimated.
3,answers all the questions,"I had some leftover pizza waiting for me at home when I watched this. So I am not sure if watching this will make you want to order pizza or not.This work was useful to me because it answered all the important questions. What are the origins of pizza? How did an Italian dish become so popular in the US? What are the origins of Pizza Hut and Domino's? When did deep-dish pizza arrive? When did delivery pizza get invented? When did frozen pizza become available to the public? Etc.Maybe Food Channel Network fans would have wanted more. For me, as a layperson who just loves him some pizza this was highly informative and in a easily (mentally) digestable format. Thanks, History Channel!"
1,Thank goodness this was a gift,"I'm watching this video right now and am waiting for some real instruction. So far 30 minutes have past and all he's done is lecture about ping-pong, the movement of the hand, and the constellation. I can't believe he charged more than $10 for this. Now he's lecturing about golf history. This is the first time he's actually brought a club out from his bag, but it was just to illustrate the tale of the beginning of golf. If you can borrow this video from someone it might be mildly helpful but I don't recommend you waste money on it."
1,The worst,"AJ Bonar is useless. No techniques are shown, the videos are poorly produced, and the entire info-mercial scheme is designed to rip people off. If you are tempted to spend 90 bucks on this set, save your time and simply throw your money out of a moving car window."
4,Simplified,"If you're like a lot of golfers who are constantly checking out different instructors, books, videos, tips, etc., then you know sometimes swingmechanics can be over-complicated. You have played some decent golf in the past, and then will suddenly find yourself in the clumsy and numb wasteland of double-bogeys and hikes through the woods and no matter how many tips you try to recall, how many analogies you try to remember, nothing can make the club click against the ball.This video set will tell you what you need to know.This isn't for the beginner, this is for the highhandicapper who has a knowledge of the basics, but still struggles, sometimes desperately, to break 90.AJ explains the simple things that you either were ever told, or completely forgot in the fog of trying new tips, new clubs, new grips, etc.This will stick with you and it works."
3,Long in the tooth...hard to watch all of it,These DVD's are worth watching if your buddy screwed up and bought them. AJ makes quite a few good points but it probably could all be summed up in 1 dvd...and should and then sold for 19.99 plus S&H. The biggest help I've recieved from watching these are improvement and a better overall understanding of my short game. It's pretty hard to stay focused listening to the guy's schtick and lame overall presentation. 5 stars if he releases a condensed version for less than 30 bucks. I'm a high (30+) handicapper
3,AJ Teaches Golf,I purchased this video and learned some valuable tips from AJ. I was disappointed in that the video did not provide more mechanical ways to employ the presented information...
3,9-Movie 3-DVD Collection,"Mad Monster Rally is a collection of three DVD's available seperately from Retromedia. For those interested in these corny old drive-in flicks, it's cheaper to buy all three collections together in one package.Morella's Blood Vision:Zombies(aka I Eat Your Skin) WidescreenThe Blood SeekersBlood Stalkers LetterboxedMorella's All-Nite Spooktacular:HobgoblinsHouse of BloodThe CrematorsSci-Fi Trash-O-Rama:Creature of DestructionThe Flying Saucer MysteryUFO - Target EarthI haven't watched all the movies yet but I can tell you the movies on the first two discs are hosted by Morella. She's more top-heavy than another famous horror hostess and has another collection not included here titled 'Morella's Blood Flood.'"
1,awful 0 star,"This are the cheapest ,awful pair of shoes that i ever paid for,i was so disgusted when i open the box,that i threw them in the trash container,never mind sending it back,i don't want to have any kind of conversation with such a company.That item is pure TRASH.and belong on the trash can,anybody that bought these shoes and is satisfied, i can say respectfully that they dont know what good shoes are all about.Will never buy from this company again.Shame on you."
4,Good product - great price,The adventure is a pretty good one. There is plenty of information. The most impressive part was the cost. There was a lot of reward for the price
3,Not as moisture rich as the one that was in the green container.,"I purchased this same size, name and manufacturer as the original one in the green container. I read word for word the ingredients. There is one small change. I like it and use it for a chapstick in winter and summer. It is not as rich or long lasting as the original first gen one, but it works fine as a chapstick and lasts longer over a period of time than a regular chapstick since a chapstick is much smaller. The green container which came out a few years ago lasted for hours and hours. It lasted as a chapstick one whole year! This one in the yellow package only a few hours at a time at best. I didn't use it during the summer for hot spots but plan to carry it along next summer for those beach days.As a chapstick, it saves money but as I said, the green one was ever better."
4,Good historical fiction,"This was a well-researched, well-thought book about a couple of East End kids who make it good with a vegetable barrow that evolves into a large department store. The research was good and the plot was good but I found the plot a little on the unlikely side simply because poor kids don't usually turn into rich adults. However, for those few that do, it was a good Horatio Alger story."
4,Enjoyable read,"I read this many years ago. My husband got me interested in Jeffrey Archer books. This is a good book and easy read, with a good story line."
5,As the Crow Flies,I've only read the first section and am really enjoying the story. This is a book I look forward to freeing up my time to get back to reading! It's my first Jeffrey Archer book and it certainly won't be my last!
5,Wonderful!,"I did not want it to end. Charlie and Becky are an inspiration to anyone looking for ""can do anything we set our mind on"" role models."
2,absolutely not Kane And Abel,"this book is my second book by Archer. I am very diappointed. After reading Kane & Abel, i was so sure that this book would at least match the pleasure i had when reading K&A. The plot is boring and the characters are shallow. Instead of concentrating on the main characters in the book, he narated this book in 6 people's point of view, but only 1 main character. Archer also included irrelevant points for each character. This 700-page book can be summarised into no more than 300 pages.Buy Kane and ABel, don't buy this one."
3,Story line just was not realistic.,"It appears I will be in the minority but the story of Charlie through the ages, just did not seem plausible. His life long enemy seemed to be directing her energies in unlikely places particulary since in the end it was at the expense of her two biological grandchildren. Charlie finds a saving grace in the implausible location of his enemy's father. This is a man who Charlie has never met but a man who for some reason would forgo his family ties inorder to help Charlie by mentioning an important clause in his will. To further complicate things in a strange direction, Daniel just happens to fall in love with his half sister who was born a continent away. Kathy ends up heading up Charlie's company but is that really a win for Charlie concidering who her biological father was? And what is the deal with the painting? Someone stole it but we never learn who or why. It just kind of shows up in the story for no real purpose. Overall, a disappointing story line."
1,boring,It's a story about two people who each inherit a business during WWI and who go on from there (with the financial help of a wealthy friend) to take advantage of WWI and WWIIs disruption to make their fortune.
5,"Loved it!....second time I""m reading it!...","I had read this book previously, but as I started reading it again, I realized that there was a lot I had forgotten about it.This is certainly ""my kind of book!"".... I loved the story line!. It goes from practically ""Rags to riches"" and I found it a pleasure tobe reading it a second time around!..And, thank God, its not a murder mystery, which I dislike intensely.... I'm now in the process of readingit the second time around, and what distresses me most is that it will come to an end and that makes mea bit sad!.I""m now in the process of checking out some of Jeffery Archers other books to see if he continuesto write in this same style as ""As the crow flies""...."
5,Wonderful work! Delightful reading!,"ATCF was my first Archer novel, and what a delight it is! I haven't put it down since I started. My lunch breaks have been extended, I'm up a little later each night, and I'm hungry for more! If you haven't read Jeffrey Archer, this would be a perfect start. Too bad I can't give it 6 stars!"
3,You read this before,"If you have read anything by Jeffrey Archer, this is another tale of a poor boy who grows to be rich. I think I had I not just finished ""sins of our Father"" and the other Harry Cliffton novel I would have enjoyed this more.This is entertaining but I felt the end was sloppy and wrapped up very quickly. Mr. Archer is one of my favorite authors and if you have not read any of his other books you will love this story. If you have you will say ""I have read this before""."
3,Just okay,From the online reviews I expected a bit more. Thought the book moved rather slowly at times and didn't develop some of the characters as much as I would have liked.
3,As The Crow Flies,I am a huge fan of Jeffrey Archer and this was the first book that disappointed me. It was an interesting read but there were too many really negative feuds.
4,Another good value from Amazon,"As an Archer fan, I enjoyed this book. The author keeps the reader in suspense wondering what stumbling block he'll throw at Charlie Trumper next! There's enough for both sexes to enjoy this book. A good read that keeps you turning the page!"
4,Technical glitch,"At letters in the book, pages containing the letter is skipped by the kindle. Eg letter on page 678 to Baverstock only first and last page of letter are displayed by the kindle. Why is this? Could you please mail me a solution to the problem?"
5,Wow...Archer comes through again!,"Jeffrey Archer is a born story teller. Book is filled with intrigue and excitement. I love a family saga such as this one that doesn't ""run out of steam"" as the story progresses. This one holds one's attention from beginning to end."
2,A victory for the Nobility,"No matter what, Lady Trentham had the last laugh, since her descendant will own the department store Charlie built.Lowborns work, but to enjoy the fruits you have to be a nobleman - says Archer, the classic snob."
5,"Jeffrey Archer- the honest, awesome author!","This epic novel was charming, compelling and rich with emotion. It is the closest thing to modern day Dickenson that I have ever read, and yet I daresay- possibly even a step above old Charles. The novel is fast moving, heart warming and spirit inspiring. It was the first work of Mr. Archer's that I had encountered,and I can assure you that after this little prize - I will be enthusiatically delving in to other novels to see what other literary jewels this man has produced.The story itself was unique and powerful. It told the tale of a generation of honesty. love and hard work. These values eminated throughout the novel and it's characters. I really enjoyed every page of this tale and only wish I could find out waht is happening next in the lives of the whole Trumper clan. The book gave me hope and honor for all the human race. I knew there were still moral, good and decent people left in this world!!"
5,"""As the Crow Flies is a great historical novel","""As the Crow Flies"" is an excellent book. I enjoyed it from cover to cover. Here's why...This book is about a man named Charlie Trumper and the hard ships faced by him while he makes his corner vending business into one of the largest department stores. It also tells of his family problems.Charlie overcomes monumental personal and business problems. Some examples are his son's suicide and the taking over of his business.If you like books about business and history then this is definitly the book for you!"
5,Smashing entertainment,"I love this book! How many times can you read something and still drain more from it? Archer has hit the spot with this one. To go over the plot, the characters, the scene setting would do the work no justice. But rest assured, you won't be dsappointed. I love this book!"
5,The best of Archer i have seen!,"When i first started reading books by Jeffrey Archer! I knew it was a start of a romance! From the day i picked up ""The Prodigal Daughter"" I finally understood the meaning of a truly excellent Author! Jeffrey Archer's As the crom Flies is an excellent work of a Genius! It goes thru the aspect of live where not many has went!In the story, Charlie Trumper from a poor boy, a soldier, a husband and also the greatest departmental store owner. How many people can enclose all these into one life! It tells people that nothing is impossible!Archer is truely an author which is imppecable and once you start to read his books you will never stop!For i know that as i own every book he has ever wrote!"
2,slow read,After reading the book description and some of the reviews I expected much more from this book. I found it to be slow and boring. Jeffry Archer is off my list and i suggest you take him off yours.
2,People have a hard time hearing you,"There are two (possibly related) issues with this unit. 1)The boom lies uncomfortably close to the face and 2) even if you carefully adjust the boom so that it is not touching your cheek, almost everyone that I spoke to asked me to switch phones / headsets after a minute (and I'm not really a quiet talker). I will not be using this unit."
1,breaks every 3 months,I had this headset twice now and it broke twice after 3 monthts. In general I won't recommend it since the audio volume is very low as well. I spend about 3-5 hours per day on the phone.
4,Good and cheap headset,"I purchased this headset to replace one that had stopped working. It functions well with my Panasonic wireless phone and is fairly comfortable. I like that the speaker is not a foam cover like many headsets, this will make it easier to keep clean and should keep clarity.The headband is very basic and not sturdy. It's cheap though, that's what I expect."
4,Phone Headset,"I have used this headset for a number of years, so when the wire cracked I was quick to order another one. I love that my hands are free while I talk and the volume control and mute function make this a wonderful tool."
4,Much nicer than my last headset,"I work from home, and need a headset since I spend 2-3 hours at a time on the phone. I used it yesterday and couldn't get the other one off my ears fast enough because it used to yank out my hair and I had to constantly repeat myself when talking to other people on the phone. The sound quality isn't the best on the new headset while I'm dialing other people, but that could have also just been my phone or their network because I called a few friends after to try it and I could hear them fine. It's going to do its job for work until I can afford something even better, and I'm satisfied with that."
5,Best Headset Out of All of Them,"I love this headset. It's my go to headset for doing work at home customer service. It is the most comfortable headset. It's super lightweight, which is essential, plus it fits my head. Using a USB adapter (not included), it blocks out all background noise. It has the required feature of a mute button and adjustable volume on the cord."
3,Works well.....for a little while,"I've just had the 2nd set become useless after less than a year. The set I had before this lasted about a year. What happens is the wire becomes messed up at the point where it joins the headset. I know this is the problem because if I jiggle the wire around at the point where it enters the headset the sound goes in and out. There's no way to easily access this area to try and re-establish a good connection so you are out of luck with every other part of the headset in still perfect. If it worked longer than one year or less, I'd give it 5 stars."
2,Plantronics M214C Headset,"This particular product did not work well with either my cordless or regular p-hone. It is difficult to hear the person talking and difficult for someone listening to me. It was suggested that I buy a ""booster"" to enhance both the listening and talking aspects. Also there were no instructions with the unit. It would be helpful if Plantronics spelled out the potential difficulties and included instructions!"
2,Greatly disappointed,I had previously purchased Plantronics headsets and thought they were great. When I saw the noise canceling feature and sound volume I thought it would be great. Volume does not really make louder but softer. Noise canceling really enhances noise. Am returning for the less expensive ones that I know work well.
2,headset problems,"I have purchases many of these from Best Buy. The last two, I have not been happy with. The headset is not comfortable and the plug for the headset has not fit very well."
5,Great headset for price,This is the second one of this same model. The first work just wore out through several years of hard use. Highly recommend.
3,can you hear me now?,"I was dissappointed when I realized that I could not use this with my pantech flex without an adapter to convert from 2.5 to 3.5. I ordered the adapter after unsucessfully trying to purchase one from radio shack. If this adapter works with my phone, I will be much more happier. I used it with my other 2.5 jack cell phone and the clarity was nice."
5,very nice item,"Very simple, easy to use. Delivered promptly. nice presentation, comfortable, fitted my needs perfectely, just what I needed, to be able to work around the house, and talk to my family."
3,Unable to use this product,"I got this to use with a telephone that I purchased. Unfortunately, the phone doesn't have a headset jack, but the product description for phones doesn't say so on any of them. The headset is probably just fine."
3,We broke it.,"It seemed to operate well while we had it. I never got the chance to actually use it. But our little ball of energy engineer tried to figure out how it moved and broke it apart. It is, as I'm sure you're well aware, really cheap, light plastic."
4,Good Value,"I bought this because I needed a hands-free headset. I have to say for the price, this was a very good value. The cord is only a few feet long but for sitting or standing at a desk it makes things much easier. The earpad is comfortable and the sound quality is good. Again, for the price you're paying, it is a good value and I would recommend this product."
3,Gets the job done.,Bought one.Liked it and ordered a second.Its not fancy but it gets the job done.Volume control is great.
4,Works well.,I have no complaints about the sound quality; it works much better than my Philips headset did which lasted about 6 months. The ear pad is soft and comfortable. My only complaint is that the headband is a little warped and can't be adjusted short enough which causes it to fit awkwardly on my head.
1,"Very poor quality, 2 broke after 1 year...","We purchased 2 of these headsets based on prior good reviews on Amazon.com. However, both items broke after 1 year of minimal to moderate use. Very frustrating, as the warranty has expired so we're stuck with a defective product with no recourse. I would advise you look elsewhere for a better product."
1,Headset,"I expected more from Plantronics when I ordered this product. The designer must not have had a head of his own, because they could not fit anyone properly. Would not recommend to anyone."
1,Iphone Users Beware - Not 3.5mm,"Plantronics has missed the boat with regard to the iPhone and new phones using a 3.5mm jack.This headset requires an adapter and there is your problem.There are different types of adapters (mono, stereo) that are very cheaply made that break or are not wired appropriately for mono headsets. Those that are properly configured, such as Headset Buddy (look for the red ones), are overly expensive and are often counterfeited being made with inferior components.Cellet, available on Amazon, is offering a 3.5mm plug on its headset that does not require an adapter. ""Cellet 3.5mm Headset with Microphone Boom"". Check it out before you buy this.It has a stereo plug (4 metal bands, 3 insulating rings) for plugging into a stereo jack such as the iphone and converting it to a mono headset. Cellet I think has this wired correctly to avoid shorting right and left channels together. Thus, it may make a better electrical connection than an adapter and provide a more reliable sound."
4,Nice headset,"This headset is a great buy for the money. It's not perfect, but it's good for the price. It's very lightweight and works great with my Panasonic KX-TGA101S and Motorola KRZR. The only 2 minor complaints I have are that it's a little loud to the people on the other end of the call. A few times I've been asked to lower the mouthpiece (to my chin level) so that I was not coming across to loudly. Also, if I move around a lot while on a call and plugged into my Panasonic phone, sometimes the connection can be a little scratchy. But overall, that has happened very few times."
1,2nd broken one in as many months,Bought a similar model three years ago and loved it. Worked great. Eventually it broke - somehow the wire connection becomes unstable.So for $15 bought a new one. It broke in a matter of weeks - same issue - the plug/wire wouldn't reliably work. Tried again with a replacement of the same model and the same problem again within a matter of weeks.Clearly - poor engineering. Plantronics cutting corners. If there was a higher quality higher-priced headset I'd gladly buy it.
1,Very disappointing. Does not work in the car.,I bought this based on all the positive reviews. I have been looking for a backup wired headset that has noise cancelling. My car generates a lot of road noise and I wanted a headset that would serve as a backup when my regular bluetooth headset runs out of battery. Unfortunately this headset is terrible. My dad complained of a buzzing and synthetic sounds being generated. Back in the box you go.Does anyone know of a superb wired headset for mobile phones that works well in cars?
2,Disappointed with this Plantronics headset,"I guess you could call me a Plantronics fan. I've used various of their headsets over the years and have always been satisfied - until now.I've been using their M210 headsets with our cordless phones for years.With a new Panasonic 2-line cordless phone system, which is a disappointment itself, I thought the in-line volume control might be helpful,It isn't. The mute control on my unit appears to be defective and doesn't operate. The control box adds just enough weight to make the cord swing unpredictably whewn you pick the unit up, increasing the odds of getting tangled or caught on something.Audio quality in the earpiece is, putting it bluntly, awful. Transmitted voice quality is also poor.Fit is comfortable and construction is adequate.Maybe I just got a defective unit in terms of the sound quality. But the in-line control box is enough of a pain to convince me to return this unit and stick with the Plantronics M210 units.Jerry"
1,Poor quality construction,I have bought two of these headsets in less than a year and both broke in less than three months in the same spot. I don't use a headset that often so this has been a huge problem and a surprise from a normally trusted brand like Panasonic. I would not recommend this product.
2,"Ok sound, but mic sometimes gets loud feedback to ear speaker","I'm rating this just 2 because when I talk, it will sometimes put what I am speaking to the ear speaker (like a feedback) and it's really loud to where it astonishes me during conversation with my customers, and thus I loose track of what I was saying. I asked some of my customers though if my voice went really loud sometimes, and they said no, and that it was constant. So it looks like the problem is just on my side."
5,Plantronics headset is nice!,"I searched and tried several headsets. This one is Comfortable, sounds good and fits my head (large) great. I highly recommend it.Bob M. Tampa, FL"
4,great headset,"Finally found a headset for my cordless phone that is comfortable and not expensive. Sound quality seems good to me. Sometimes when the other person is on a speaker phone, my breathing can knock out the sound, but all I have to do is move the mouthpiece above or below my mouth, and that usually takes care of it."
2,Broke after a few months,"Unacceptable! It works fine at first and then all of a sudden it just stopped after a few months, Very inconvenient."
2,Break after 8 weeks,"What's the point, if they don't even last a year? I've had two sets of these and they break easily."
1,No Good if It Doesn't Work,"This was a gift for a lady who has limitted use of her hands. It was sent as an early Christmas gift, fortunately, because now I must find something else. The pictured Item looks good and comfortable. Regardless of the appearance or comfort it is no good if it doesnt work. The lady has an ATT cell phone, a mistake, but that is it. This thing doesn't work at all. A friend is going to try finding someone who can use it. Be very careful what you order this for or don't order it at all."
5,Free up your hands,My arm got tired holding the phone up to my ear.The Plantronics M214C headset is the solution.I can talk without hearing all the background noisealso.
3,Tech Purchase,"So far, slightly good. I am finding some people can hear me well where others say I sound muffled or I am breaking in out. There could be other factors contributing but I am not sure as of yet. Overall, its decent product and convenient for the work that I do with a cushion earpiece. I wish the tightening settings were a little more firm though...a bit flimsy."
1,plantronic M214C,Bad experience. It didn't work! It came with no instructions and I found none on line! I tried hooking it up to several devices but it failed to work on any of them.
2,Don't expect this to last more than 6 months,I have to use a headset for work and I have bought several Plantronics brand headsets. I purchased this one from Amazon in January - it is now June. The headset will not make a connection with my phone and I am forced to buy yet another headset. Looking for a different brand this time for sure. Don't waste your money on plantronics.
2,OK not great,"Low volume headset, Need an adapter to use with a cell phone. I ordered a different brand to see if I can get more volume. I will keep this set as a spare."
1,Does Not Work With Mobile Phones,"I bought this expecting it to work with my Samsung Galaxy S II and Apple iPhone 4 cell phones. I discovered when it arrived that it has a 2.5mm plug. I then realized that both my phones have a 3.5mm jack. Well that will not work. Then I looked backed at the headset advertisement on Amazon. Yes, it does say it has a 2.5mm jack. But the advertisement also says that it works with most phones. I even bought an adapter, but the adapter works only for stereo phones. This Plantronics headset is mono. Sheesh. Think I'll return it. Make sure your phone has a 2.5mm mono jack before you buy this one. The package says ""Made for the first moon landing."" Does this mean that it is for phones made 40 years ago?"
2,Could not be used with my phone.,This may be a very good product. I gave it two stars because I had to return it since it was not adaptable to my phone.
3,First days with the item,"I ordered this to use for my work from home customer service job. First impressions: I've never used a one ear headset before and it feels a bit awkward for me. I wish it had a second speaker for the other ear, because even at the loudest setting it is still a little hard to hear the other person. The microphone seems ok, the people I'm speaking to say they can hear me perfectly. The microphone does seem a bit odd to me, since it is right beside your mouth and you can't move it further away. I'm going to try it for a little while and see how I feel about it, will update this review later."
1,This does not fit an iphone 4,"I saw reviews saying it does fit iphone, but I was disappointed that it does not fit the Iphone 4."
2,Didn't work,It's advertised as working with the IPhone but it needs a big ass adaptor you have to buy separately from Radio Shack. I wouldn't purchase it again.
1,CHEAP and USELESS,Product is a waste of time and money. Everyone complains that they cannot hear me clearly. I am still waiting on my darn refund!!Do yourself a favor and stick to the single earpiece wired headset!
3,Not compatible with Panasonic KX-TG1032 digital phone,"Be aware that this headsetPlantronics M214C Headset with Adjustable Volumedoes not work with the Panasonic KX-TG1032 digital phone.Because this item was featured with the Panasonic KX-TG1032, and because Plantronics' headsets have a good reputation, I ordered them at the same time. The Plantronics headset turned out to be incompatible with the Panasonic phone. I could hear the person I called but they could not hear me. I have no comment on the quality of the item itself; the sound quality from my end was fine but I was unable to really use the item. So the ""3 stars"" shown above are only there to comply with Amazon's requirement for a rating."
5,Plantronics headset,I have purchased this product multiple times with good results and will continue to use it.
2,Poor Sound Quality,"Comfortable headset to wear, but I find it very, very hard to hear the people I'm speaking with - when the volume is turned up high. Unacceptable. I will replace this headset right away."
2,Sound quality poor. I often have to remove.,"I like Plantronics ordinarily, but it seems nobody has made a reliable headset for a phone. Not even them. Sound quality is muffled, dead, sometimes so bad I have to remove 'em."
4,good mic for the price,this was an affordable mic and does a good job for the price. It was a little hard to hear at first with the volume up on the mic but thn I turned the volume up on the phone and it works great.
1,Cindy's point of view,The M214C is not what I suspect. I am actually having a hard time hearing out of it. I need both of my hands and I am finding myself having to press the ear pad into me just to hear. Sorry no rating for this item from me
1,Horrible Headset,"There is really nothing good I can say about this headset. Even cheap, it is not worth buying. Yes, you can hear, but there is sometimes static, sometimes and echo. It is not comfortable at all and for some reason the ear piece sounds muted, like underwater. Definitely do not recommend. My sons $10 Xbox headset works much better."
1,Junk,"Microphone stopped working after 1 day. Tossed packaging so can't return. Cheap stuff, take your chances. Some people get lucky"
2,Flimsy & Cheap,"I wear an XL sized motorcycle helmet and this headset has to stretch a little to fit on my head. It was not particularly comfortable for me to wear. At best, in a quiet room, the audio has been described as making me sound like I'm on a speakerphone. That defeats the purpose of a headset if you ask me. I recommend putting the money you'd waste on this headset towards something better."
3,Low mic volume,"I bought this along with a Panasonic KX-TG1061 phone, and everyone I have tried to speak with using this headset and the phone has told me they could barely hear me. I hooked it up to another phone and it works fine. I bought the Panasonic headset instead and it works fine with the phone. Something must be wrong with the electronics in the headset that make it incompatible with this one specific phone."
2,Microphone doesn't rotate all the way down,"The headset works fine, but the microphone only rotates about 270 degrees total. That means that it won't go down all the way to my mouth/chin, but rather sits about even with my nose, making my breathing come through loud and clear to my ears (not sure if the person on the other end of the phone hears it, but I do!). Even if it's not broadcast into the conversation it's distracting to me."
3,Decent for the price but broke after 1 year,"It was a pretty good headset considering the price. Sounds quality, comfort were all okay but afer 1 year the sound quality deteriorated to the point where it wasn't working Not very durable in my opionion"
5,Great inexpensive headset,"I bought this headset to use with a corded telephone for my business. It is lightweight and comfortable. I have used it for 7 hour days and have not had any problems with the comfort in those 7 hours. I prefer dual earphone but the sound is great and I have not had any problems with hearing people. My furnace is close to my office and have not had any complaints about background noise so the noise cancellation is working well. Adjusting the sound is easy and the mute works quite well. I tested it while speaking with people and no one could hear me when I muted the phone. Even though it is inexpensive, it is not a cheap headset. I have no complaints!"
2,hearing is a problem,"I like the feel of it and how it sits on my head however, the volume is not high enough to hear well enough. I do not have a hearing problem. Because of this default in the product, i couldn't recommend it to others."
3,small design flaw,"This headset has superior sound, in both directions.However, the headband and microphone move as a single unit so that when I have the mic in a good position, the headband is not in an ideal position. Also the headband has no padding at the end, the point where it presses most directly against the head."
4,Very Good Unit-Mic Boom has no lateral adjustment,Excellent price for this well featured product. I would have liked the mic boom to have some lateral adjustment so the only reason for not giving this full five stars. I do recommend this headset as it is just a good as those I have paid three times the price. I will purchase more in the future.
1,Better off buying a can on a string,I wish I had not thrown the packaging away so I could return this. Awful audio quality both on mic and earpiece. Flimsy plastic torques mic into side of cheek. About 3 inches of play in the mic as it attaches to headpiece. I can go on and on....DO NOT BUY THIS
2,Doesnt work well with cell phones,"Didn't work with my cell phone people found it hard to hear me, and no noise cancellation either. Granted it was cheap, but if you are buying it for use with a cell phone look elsewhere. I would return it but threw out the packaging. Another waste of money. At least I keep my garbage man busy."
1,Cheap broke first day and sound terrible,Cheap broke first day and sound terrible. Not sure why anyone would rate this 5 stars worth $5. Are also uncomfortable.
4,Works as a good Xbox360 replacement headset,"My original 360 headset went south, so I grabbed this as a replacement. The Turtle Beach headphones, etc... were way beyond what I needed. I have a sound system, so I only needed the headset for voice chat.This product fills that role just fine. The sound quality is better than the normal 360 headset, and I've had no complaints about how I sound.It plugs into the controller the same as the 360 headset, so there is no need for batteries. The on cord mute button serves the same function as the one on the original, there is also on cord volume control, and there's a couple different mic levels, so you can adjust how loud you are as well.This is pretty much the 360 headset, just upgraded. So if you're looking for a new one, go for it."
2,Repackaged & Sold As New,"I received this headset with no user manual/paperwork and it was obvious to me that it had been returned and repackaged.The unit worked fine and since it only costed about $12 bucks it wasn't worth the trouble to send it back.I ordered NEW and received repackaged/refurbed, but I'm still OK with this since it didn't cost much. If it hadbeen a $100+ purchase. I would have returned it out of principal."
2,Doesn't work with my phones,"I bought this at a local office supply store. I've had good luck with Plantronics products in the past, but not this one.I attached it to a Uniden PowerMax cordless phone. The only headset control that worked was the earpiece volume control. The microphone volume control was inoperable, as was the mute switch.I tested it on my LG cell phone to see if it might be a problem with the Uniden. When used with the cell, the mute switch worked fine, but the microphone volume control was again inop.I also don't like the design of the boom mike. It needs to be adjustable away from the face. As it is, it only rotates up and down, which puts it in a position to rub my face (making microphone noise as my face moves when I talk).I'll try to return it tomorrow."
5,Plantronic headst,"Very good headset for the inexpensive price. Have had this same model for at least three years. The wire from the headset is a ""little"" thin and if you are not careful it can break somewhat easily. Mine broke because my 1 year old granddaughter grabbed it.Yes, I would recommend this headset"
2,Didn't last,I bought this to use with our office Panasonic cordless phones after the cheap headset that came with them died. This had poor sound quality from the beginning and it did not last.
1,Headset,"I rarely would put one star for anything but I pulled this out of the box today and it is useless. The jack is too small to fit in any of our cell phones, home mobile phones or most importantly the iPad. I looked not only at Amazon's limited info but went to Plantronics web site to check on the jack (make sure it is a single jack and has 4 rings). I could not find ANYTHING that states the jack size except a statement that it works on mobile phones and most cell phones. This device has a 3 ring 2.5mm jack as cell phones of 10 years ago but mobile phones and smart phones of today need a 3.5mm jack. Now I will have to go to RadioShack to buy an adapter for this Headset."
3,"Works fine, but fit is just ok.","I purchased this headset to replace another brand that I have been using for several years. The headset works fine, the speaker is ok, and the sound quality is just ok. the only real issue is the way it fits. It is not very comfortable on the head. Overall it just feels like a very inexpensive headset, and though the price is not much, you might want to pay a few dollars more and get a quality headset."
3,Headset,"The problem we had was that there was no information in the add about phone compatability. I called the manufacturer and found that the headset had not been tested for compatability with our phone. Also there was not a diagram to show how the switches worked. I had to call the manufacturer for that information. The headset works on our phone, but has limited range from the base. Sometimes the other party says that we are breaking up."
1,Poor quality,This product varies widely from one to another some are almost useless and very hard to hear on
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,THE WORST QUALITY. THE CONNECTOR DOES NOT FIT INTO THE HEADPHONES INPUT. I WAS NOT ABLE TO USE IT WITH ANY COMPUTER.
1,Terrible Echo!,"This headset fits great and is really comfortable, but everyone I talk to using this has to hang up, or have me take the headset off because all they can hear is a terrible Echo on their side."
3,PLANTRONICS PHONE HEAD SET,"I HAVE BEEN USING HEAD SETS FOREVER ~ GENERALLY, THEY DO NOT HAVE A LONG LIFE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE THROW-AWAY ITEMS. THIS ONE I ORDERED THRU AMAZON WAS INEXPENSIVE, ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY & WORKS VERY WELL. IT IS FLIMSIER THAN THOSE I PAID TWICE AS MUCH FOR, BUT IT SERVES THE PURPOSE. I WOULD GET IT AGAIN. IT IS LIGHT IN WEIGHT & THE SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD."
2,volume is very low.,"This product might work ok for some applications, but it is a complete waste of money if you are planning to make short recordings for You Tube or pod cast. The quality just isn't there. The recording volume was very low. I had so many hisses; I could barely hear my voice. I ended up going out to buy something else."
2,"Good, but didn't last","was a great affordable headset, but only lasted 7 months - started to cut out and now doesn't work at all."
2,Very Low Volume,This headset is extremely quiet (at least when used with a mobile phone). With handset and headset volume turned up to 100 percent and straining to listen I can barely hear the person I'm talking to!
1,Plantronics M214C Headset With Adjustable Volume,"I bought this brand new head set only to use it a whopping 5 times before I got fed up with it. I have to make calls on a daily basis with my active accounts at work, so a hands free headset would be ideal for my occupation. I plugged it in adjusted the volume and mic to high, and I was still not able to hear the customers, nor were they able to hear me. Finally realizing that I was practically yelling on the phone so they could hear me, I decided at that point that the head set were a no-go. Loved the price... Hated the product."
4,Great telephone headset for the price,"I love this Plantronics M214C telephone headset. It makes my life so much better. I find that I can wear it all day and never feel uncomfortable. The only negative thing I can say is that after a year I had to replace it. (That is why I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars). I called the number on the receipt and told them and they said that is not unusual.... It all depends on how much you use it and abuse it. I do tend to walk away from the telephone and then it jerks the cord in doing so I am sure that does not help the cause. But since it was so comfortable, I decided to buy another one."
2,Worked great initially then broke,"I purchased Plantronics M214C Headset about a year ago to use it with my home phone. I could hear clearly and the microphone seemed to be working fine. Overall, I was happy with this headset for a year, until recently when the speaker stopped working. I love Plantronics products in general, but this headset didn't meet my quality expectation."
4,Plantronics M214C Headset,"I bought this locally from an office supply. I paid considerably more for mine, because I needed it in a hurry. It comes with a one year manufacturer's warranty. It has two sliding switches and a wheel type volume control on the cord. One switch is a two position sensitivity/volume control for the microphone (high and low), and the other is a sliding microphone mute switch. The microphone is fairly long and wraps around just to the corner of your mouth.I sent myself a voice mail using the headset to check for voice and sound quality. The microphone records well and is fairly directional, so normal side room noises are not picked up. The sound quality is satisfactory, but certainly not high fidelity. The headband would become annoying if it was worn for long periods. For a very inexpensive headset used occasionally, this one works reasonably well. If you spend long hours on the phone, invest the money to buy professional quality office headset."
1,Watch out!!! Mute is still audible,Watch out! The mute on this still allows some sound to get through. That can be a big problem.
4,Nice headset,"Plantronics M214C Headset with Adjustable VolumeI just received this headset, made couple calls to my friends asking for call quality. They said the call is very clear. Its very convenient too to wear it around head.Last before week, I have ordered 'Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-Free Headset' and that headset is total bad. People complained that they hear lot of static in the background with that set. But with this new 'Plantronics M214C Headset' - no problem , all clear. I paid $12+ for this headset vs $8+ for panasonic one. its really totally worth paying this extra 4 bucks especially I spend more time on phone as I work remote.And by the way the phone I connected with this is 'AT&T; SL82118 DECT 6.0', and this combination worked good for me."
2,Good headset IF it works,"I had to go through two defective headsets before getting one that worked. I like the adjustable volume controls for both mic and earpiece + mute button, but I'm unimpressed with Plantronic's quality control. Consider buying it locally to make the return process easier."
4,Good Headset,Overall this is pretty good headset. I like that fact it is comfortable to wear on the head and flexible to expand a bit. Quality of voice is fine too.
3,Does what I needed it to!,"Considering the cost, it's perfect. Has mute. Has volume control. Has a little bit of an echo - but only sometimes, so maybe it's the line not the headset. It is, after all, a Plantronic. I'm very happy with it and would buy it again."
2,Expect to work only for a year,"When I first purchased the headset, it was working just fine. But after a year of not even frequent usage, I can barely hear the phone conversation and people kept saying that I speak too soft."
3,"Works well, but feels cheap","They work well, and so far I'm happy with them. That said, they feel like they are made 'cheap.' I'm worried they will break if anything happens to them, or if my 9 year old daughter gets a hold of them. Also, the ear piece is not all too comfortable and does not sit and stay on my ear. That said, for what I paid, so long as they last, I'll be happy."
2,Poor product,"Very comfortable but even with the volume turned up s high s it will go, I can't hear very well out of the earpiece. Waste of money. I threw it to the back of my closeet and looking for something better."
3,Average quality headset,"Overall, the product is ok. You could hear others well with a sufficient quality. However, as stated by others, one of its cons is the quality of your voice as observed by the other party. I was told that I either sound muffed or I don't sound the ""right"". For an average set, this is ok."
2,They all eventually break,"See my review of Panasonics headsets, these all just break after about a month. We've tried all brands and types and have not found any that last longer than a month. These should be called 'disposable' as that is what they are...."
2,"OK in a home. No noise filter, can't be used in a car",Works well in a quiet environment. Fits iphone with an adaptor cable changing 5.5mm to 2.5mm. Impossible for anyone to hear anything when calling from a car. FYI.
2,"Decent features, but cheaply made.","Plantronics M214C Headset with Adjustable VolumeThe Plantronics M214C Headset with Adjustable Volume looks fine on paper. It is affordable and has several features I find useful (on-chord mute switch and volume control). Unfortunately, it is also cheaply made. My copy arrived with a short in the chord, which causes my phone to drop calls, my audio to drop out, and bursts of static on my conference calls. It is never okay to be that guy, when hosting large international conference calls."
2,Can't hear with this headset,"This headset is comfortable and easy to plug in and use, and the mic is perfect - my callers hear me fine with no background noise. However, it's absolutely IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR a caller using this headset - which makes it impossible to do my job. The volume control does NOTHING. Soooo frustrating. I have to buy another headset, one that allows me to hear the caller. Suggestions?"
2,Too small for an adult,The sound quality is fine but I am curious as to what size head this was designed for. It's almost unusable as far as I am concerned. It might work great for a teen or small head size but it's worthless otherwise.
1,Save your money...,"These are halfway decent, however know that you will be replacing them every 3-6 months. They simply stop functioning after a while. I finally got fed up and purchased a more expensive set by Plantronics, and they work great. You get what you pay for. I recommend springing for a better model for more money."
4,Best money I ever spent,"I am so happy with this headset, I use it all the time. It's lightweight and comfortable and works well.There are some occasions where my voice has not come through very clearly on phone calls but after a few adjustments, I can usually get the sounds to be heard well on the other end. Great value for the price."
2,Works for a while and dies,"I am going through my 2nd one. When i bought it, everything was fine but after some months of using it people can hear me and i can't hear them."
2,Great sound quality & volume; but for LIMITED time only.,"I loved this headset for many months - even the full year of the warranty. At about 16 months out, the headset began acting like the mute button was pressed. Period. No one can hear me, even though I can hear them. Now it's worthless, obviously. Even if an inexpensive consumer item has only a one year warranty, I believe it should last for much longer; I don't believe in the idea that these are simply disposable items. I also purchased a Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-Free Headset with Comfort Fit Headband. That one still works, but ouch! it's too tight on my smaller-than-average adult head. Hope this helps!"
1,Flimsy,"The earpiece seemed a tad loose when the headset arrived. But it seemed to work. So after a few days I tossed out the box. Now the microphone boom got so loose that it falls straight down and the earpiece is so loose you can spin it around. At this price it's not worth the hassle to send back, but I'd never buy this model again. Too bad, because all my other Plantronics equipment has been pretty good."
4,good product for the price,"This headset works great. People on the phone can't tell I'm on a headset which is the whole point. I like the volume control on the cord but the cord is WAY TOO SHORT for me (only 3 feet). I couldn't even turn my head away from the phone without pulling the cord tight, so I had to buy a cord extension (which was very inexpensive). So overall good product for the price."
5,Love it,"This is the ONLY headset I use- any other others fall off or move around, even the blue tooth but this one stays in place and I can hear clearly- I keep it on all the time when I'm driving and keep an extra in the house for talking. I can move about the house and do things while talking on the phone."
1,Too quiet / mute switch hard to use,"This Plantronics M214C headset is one of the few items I've ever returned to amazon, its that bad. With the volume cranked all the way, this headset was still too quiet to hear the other party. Also, one of its big features turned out to be a dud - the mute switch! Its very hard to slide, requiring two hands - one to hold the controller, the other to slide the switch. Makes it impossible to pop in and out of a conference call quickly by toggling the mute switch. I ended up getting aPanasonic KX-TCA60headset instead and its FAR louder. I don't miss the lack of volume or mute controls on thePanasonic KX-TCA60as those buttons are on the handset."
2,easy to wear but hard to hear.,"I do a little side business out of my home that requires me to be on the phone alot. I got this thinking it would be helpful and it is... if there is no other sound in the room and if the person on the other end of the line speaks up. I have the headphone maxed on volume and I have to listen very closely to hear everything they say. I wish there was a way to increase the sound beyond what there is. Oh well, I guess I can't listen to music in the background while I work at home."
4,Plantronics M214C is a winner,Before I made the purchase I read reviews and it did influence my purchase. Plantronics also has an excellent reputation. I really like the headset because I use it in an office environment which is why I did not want a stereo headset. The M214C gives very crisp and clean sound. I am not going to count against the M214C but I also own a Sennheiser PC21 and yes the PC21 has deeper bass and yes I did pay more money for the PC21. I have also bought a Panasonic KX-TCA430 and the KX-TCA430 had muffled sound. I like my M214C and I reccommend to anyone considering to make a monophonic headset purchase
5,nice nice,i bought this to replace an old headset with no volume control or mute switch. This one is very comfortable and sounds great. love the mute function too.
2,Bad sound quality. Buy another brand instead.,"I just broke my Panasonic KX-TCA60 by sitting on it accidentally, so I thought I'd try this one for a change. It did look cooler and I like the volume adjustment feature. The only thing about this that's better than the Panasonic is its looks. The sound quality is horrible. The levels max out and it sounds distorted all of the time. The volume is also too low, even at the highest setting. The mouth piece only swings up and down, but does not bend like the Panasonic. I shoved this in the closet and taped up my Panasonic to get it working again. If you're undecided, get the Panasonic KX-TCA60. It's even $4 cheaper! As expected, the Panasonic build isn't top notch, but its functionality is head and shoulders above the Plantronics."
3,Good but Volume too low,"I've been giving this headset a run for its money and it has held up. Works with my cordless phone and iPhone (w/ adapter that came with phone).It's comfortable and sound quality is good, but the volume won't go high enough when there is other noise around. I have to press the earpiece to my ear in order to hear people. Very frustrating. I'm about to buy a better model. Hope I have better luck next time."
3,Mediocre Headset,"I've been using this headset with a Uniden cordless (5.8 GHz) and an AT&T; corded phone. In both cases, people complain that they can't hear me very well. Using the so-called microphone volume switch doesn't seem to make much difference.It's also not particularly comfortable. I can hear other people fine, but of course that's only half of the challenge with voice communications."
2,"Sound is find, cord is not","While the sound quality is just fine for a product that is this inexpensive, the connector cord keeps twisting around itself leaving me physically bound closer and closer to my phone.If I had known the cord did this I wouldn't have bought the headset because it's very annoying and limiting."
3,Mixed opinion,"This headset worked well with my personal cell phone when I tested it at home. However, I purchased it for use at work and it did not work well with the spectralink phones there. The person receiving my call could hear me fine but all I heard was loud echos, making it totally unusable for me."
2,Comfortable doesn't count if no one can hear or understand you.,When I used this headset I got complaints from anyone I called. I would not recommend them at all.
3,Just ok...,"Works OK with my Panasonic cordless phones, but the volume is weak. Tried with my cell phone and it's useless. The person on the other end can't hear much at all (regardless of mic gain switch)."
2,Actual audibility not included,"I was excited about this little headset as it has the volume control and mutefeatures right on the cord. So handy. I'm using a Samsung cell phone.But I was disappointed using it. Even turned up to ""maximum"" volume, I could barely hear. And those I talked to on the other end couldn't hear me, either. The headset itself seems sturdy, but the volume control is both flimsy in construction and useless in function. Bummer.Would not recommend."
3,You get what you pay for,"Make no mistake about it this is a basic wired headset. Thats what I wanted and thats what I got. I did not want a blue tooth and those things that plug into your ear are not for me. Even with the volume all the way up I still have trouble hearing callers if there is any background noise near my car. Others seem to hear me wothout and problems. The head strap is soft, pehaps too sofe and has to be twisted and reshaped from time to time"
1,Difficult for other party to hear,"I tried calling several people with this headset and I tired adjusted it every which way, but others has trouble hearing me and found the audio terribly scratchy. I was able to hear quite well on my end, but...I generally don't wish to talk to myself when I'm on the phone. What can I say? I'm just like that."
4,Love this headset,"I think this is the 3rd or 4th one of these headsets I've purchased. It is relatively inexpensive and I use it aobut 8 hours/day, 5 days/week on a cordless Uniden phone. About every 1.5 - 2 years the cord connection at the end becomes fragile and the person on the other end has a hard time hearing me. I know that's when it's time to purchase a new one, but for $10 - $15, I think 1.5 - 2 years is a pretty good lifetime since I use it all day, every day. I would definitely recommend this headset to heavy/light users equally. It's very comfortable and sound quality is also quite good."
1,Blackberry compatiblity,I bought the product - at the suggestion of Amazon - along with a 2.5 - 3.5 adapter so it would work with my Blackberry 9700. The combination does not work but I don't know if that's because the adapter isn't adapting or if the headset has an issue. Another couple of bucks down the drain.
2,Didn't Work with My Cellphone,They really need to be more thoughtful in their description of these headsets. After purchasing the headset and Amazon recommended adopter to use it with my cellphone I found it didn't work. I returned the adopter and purchased another from a local store. The headset did not work with that one either.If these headsets are for use with cordless home phone systems only than they need to be clear about that. Big waste of time and had to be sent back.
1,Afterschool special music,Yes the title cut is nice but the rest is really bad 70's folk. Stick w/ America or CSN.
4,Good Old School 80's CD,"This CD is laced with some very popular one-hit wonders! It is an entertaining compilation of 80's hits! Brings back the good ol' days! If you're a real 80's fan, it will be a good addition to your collection!"
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this last March'06.. I use the desktop sparingly.. But still the Motherboard failed in Oct'06. Called Sony, they replaced it. In Dec'06, failed again.. Called Sony, they replaced it.. In Feb'07 failed again.. I was mad, as the warranty was in the last month and I insisted that they need to fix the route cause instead of replacing the mother board... but instead, replaced again and the system was sent back to me.. I travelled abroad for 3 months & came back last month.. in 3 weeks, it failed again..Sony was rude and was not ready to replace or repair.. The rep, then their supervisor replied, I am out of warranty and didnt want to listen. It is a piece of Junk.."
4,Great story with colorful illustrations,"This was a clever story about a rabbit who is seeking wisdom and all the tasks that he's been given. We enjoyed it, but I tend to try to avoid 'god' stories as I don't think they are appropriate. There is a line between imagination and magical thinking in my book."
5,Bunnie!,"My two your old loves this story, and though he insist that the leopard is a tiger, he loves evert page. We got it three days ago, and we've read it more than two times a day ever since. Of course, there are many levels in the stories he doesn't understand yet, but I think he can sense some though. And I find the story delightful too. I am looking forward to reading it to my son for many years to come."
2,"Might be good for older children, not for preschoolers","There are some beautiful pictures in this book, but I really didn't like the dialogue between the children and the parents. Lots of ""this is dumb"" and ""that's stupid"". I'd rather not encourage my 3 year old to call people 'dumb' or say things relating to having a baby are 'stupid'. I had to edit too much of this book as I read it to her to make it worthwhile. The pictures are good though..there is one page showing the baby growing in the mother...very nice."
2,Not really for young children,"I don't recommend it for young children. I don't really recommend it at all. The graphics are ""70s-ish"" and the storyline is boring for a child. There's a lot of talk about sex and love and whether or not the mommy and daddy like sex. The books contains mild drawings of a mommy with a baby growing in her belly. It's not a controversial book, I just didn't care for it - I think the cartoon on the cover led me to believe it was appropriate for young children. My daughter never wants to read it and frankly, neither do I."
1,Not for Preschoolers (as listed),"I started reading this book to my (then) 4-yr-old. I think we got through 4 pages. We haven't opened it since. It's just not put in a format that would keep a preschoolers attention. I agree with the concept and general theory of the author, but I cannot recommend this book for young- to non-readers."
5,"I laughed so hard, I may have blown a fuse in my brain!","Having cracked the 'seventh seal' of this mad-cap farce of the small town doings of the local town-'volk', I can see where Daedalus (Chris F.) gets his inspiration. There is no other tome quite like this, and the fact that Mr. Howell is well versed in the dramatic scene makes his humorous novel akin to a theatrical production of the finest degree! Buy this book and read it out loud on the street-corner of your favorite small town!"
2,Unreadable,"As a reasonably educated 41 year old East Coast white dude, I found this book basically unreadable. I stopped after about page 30. Maybe I need to brush up on my Swedish B-film history and try again."
1,It was terrible.,Dislike. It was horrible. I didn't like it at all. I only watched it because I was paying for it.
3,"This was a quirky, enjoyable little film","'Searching for Sonny' didn't take itself too seriously and viewers shouldn't either. If you're expecting a film grounded in reality and every day believability, well, you won't find it here. There was some humor, a little drama, a little action, but mostly it was filled with an offbeat absurdity that held a charm of its own. It wasn't a film noir or even a satire of one, but it had elements of such in a broader sense. I bought the film because I'm a huge Jason Dohring fan and it was nice seeing him again. If you're a fan of him, you'll enjoy the film. If you like offbeat quirky indie films you'll probably enjoy the film as well."
5,Smokin' Joe Smokes!,"Having seen Smokin' Joe Kubek and Bnois King live just three days ago I can tell you that they are modern-day masters of the blues. Although Texas-based their sound extends to Chicago and New Orleans as well. Additionally, Smokin' Joe's slide guitar work is outstanding and gives the modern-day listener a sense of what Elmore James likely sounded like live.Like so many contemporary blues artists Smokin' Joe Kubek and Bnois King have never received the critical acclaim and popularity that their outstanding music deserves. Catch them live if you can and absolutely get hold of all their CD's!The Hot Docmbrviper@aol.com"
3,Um... ok?,"So I'm an experienced adventure gamer. I love the technology's ability to weave story and game into one... but this is just ridiculous on many levels. The storyline leaves you questioning the integrity of the composition process, suggesting many writers instead of a closely-knit collaboration. The visuals are great for their time... but humans would have been better represented by movies. The landscapes draw you in, the furniture is well done, and the soundtrack is absolutely FIRST RATE. Almost worth buying for the classic tunes. Almost. The ending was relatively unsatisfying, and the puzzles were too straightforward."
5,Fabulous game.,"A creepy, lush, riveting storyline combined with an engaging style of gameplay glues you to your keyboard. A wonderful game!"
1,seven wasted hours of the soul,"I can't say enough about how poor this game is, especially after having finished a *real* game (grim fandango: buy it now). Typos, bugs and poor dubs are bad enough, but to have to endure the inane plot, the senseless ""puzzles"" and the utterly frustrating lack of continuity is too much (not to mention the poor attemps at ripping off myst/riven).It's strange, though. There is some out-of-place attention to detail in odd areas. My guess is there was an above average art director, an ok story teller, some run-of-the-mill programmers, a UI person that had no clue, and someone in charge that had a ""QA-be-damned"" attitude that only cared about getting the thing out and didn't care about playability. I can't imagine *anyone* getting by without a guide book. It is just too obscure, annoying, and just plain idiotic to play. There, you've been warned."
2,"Um... well, it's European","A strange little game which starts very ambitiously and really gets lost along the way somewhere. There are a number of borderline offensive features -- such as the sex dream sequence, the subtext that Satan's not such a bad guy after all, and the Uncle Tom-like black character in overalls -- but the thing that really turned me off was the bad writing, bad animation, and bad acting. Or maybe it's just a bad translation? All in all, not really worth the bother."
2,"Constricted gameplay, confusing storyline","+'s = decent graphics, interesting movies -'s = limiting gameplay only allows you to do what they require, many rooms/areas are shown that cannot be explored, your actions have little to do with the plot (it is more like movie that you watch than it is a game), multiple objects cannot be used/are not needed, minimal charachter detail"
4,Great Game,This a fun adventure! I am new to adventure games and this was good. The puzzles were not too hard to figure out. I did have to cheat a little bit.
3,It was okay,"I kinda liked it at first. I love puzzle, gotta figure things out kind of games, but after a while this one got pretty dumb. The graphics are pretty 'archaic' as far as 3D animation goes now days. It's definitely not Titan A.E. quality. Some of the puzzles were impossible to figure out in my opinion. Like I said, it started out okay, seemed like a really intense story but it got pretty dull and dumb pretty quick."
3,"So so, i guess",Very short. Doesn't live up to the expectations. Unconnected stories. No good explainations for the puzzles. So so ending. But I still enjoyed it anyway.
1,"buy the seventh guest instead. or watch the movie ""freaks"".","i sincerely regret the money i spent on this. the gameplay was awkward and way too linear. the graphics were malformed and irritating, with these huge pockmarked looking chins. bleah. i didn't bother getting past the second chapter.when i buy a game one of my requirements is FUN. while the ambience was nice, i don't find it FUN to go over and over and over doing the same tasks to find one stupid little thing. that's bad design. or to have to hover over a practically one-pixel area to find said item or hint.i recommend either encasing the game in concrete and dropping it in the ocean, or saving your money all together."
3,Short and Kinda Sweet,"I am a big time Spyro fan, so of course I was thrilled to play this game. I enjoyed the 'flashback to the 80s platformer' game style and the overall look of the game, but it was over too quickly! I finished the game in a few hours and it wasn't strictly because it was a short game...it was also very easy. Definitely not one of my favorite games and although I enjoyed it while it lasted, I doubt I will be playing it again."
4,activites,Today we recieved our first issue of High Five. I remember doing the Highlight magazines as a child and wanted to give that experience to my 2 year old child. We look forward to doing the activites as a family.
1,Never Received First Issue and was CHARGED!!!,"As I read some other reviews from the regular Highlights magazine I see that many others are in the same boat as I am. I ordered Highlights High Five on Dec 23, 2009 and today is May 7, 2010 and the first magazine has yet to hit our mailbox. I called the company and was told it will take 5-7 days to research this and give me an answer. I am VERY DISSATISFIED!!!! My child has been looking forward to getting this and now unfortunately is getting too old for this since it has taken 6 months and he is now over age 6. I don't even want to try and order the regular Highlights after reading that these people aren't getting their magazines either!!!! I have never seen such poor service! They have charged me for this and I wonder how long it will take to even get a refund! I am a big fan of Amazon, but they need to do something about their magazine venders!"
3,I am disappointed.,I ordered it after reading all good reviews. But I was really disappointed when I got it. It's very light weighted. Not much stuff in there. And worst of all my son doesn't like it.
1,"Great Content, Terrible Customer Service!","Our 3-year old enjoyed this magazine for a year. Then it was time to renew and the trouble started. After two months of trying to work with customer service, I gave up and cancelled our subscription. Save yourself the grief, and deal with another company."
5,Great,In my opinion all of these mags are a bit off on age range. Magazines should be used for pleasure reading. Teaching your children to love literacy. Therefore I think these are more appropriate for children slightly older than what the publisher claims. Like 5 - 8. My 2nd graders love these magazines!
5,High Five for little ones,High Five was purchased for my 3 yr. old great granddaughter. She loves getting her own mail and enjoys the activities. Also promotes good family time as all of us work withh her.
5,Wholesome and fun for 4-year-old,"Often when it's time to pick a book to read at bedtime, my 4-year-old will reach for one of his High Five magazines instead of a traditional kids' book. This is quite a relief because some of the ""regular"" kids books he has picked out involve semi-violent super heroes and branded characters without much of an educational component. We like reading High Five together and participating in activities that use different skills, such as counting, finding hidden pictures, and reading short stories. It's sometimes a bit too easy for him so I think after this year (after he turns 5) we'll move on to the regular Highlights magazine. But it's really great fun for the preschool years and I think it's teaching him to love books and reading, even when they don't involve licensed characters."
5,Wonderful magazine,"I ordered this for my grandson last December when he was 3 1/2. He absolutely loves it. Every day he goes to the mailbox, hoping his magazine is there. And he is so excited when it comes. He and his Mom or Dad reads the entire thing cover to cover as soon as the magazine arrives. He then wants to re-read it every day until a new one comes. I have read the magazine to him many times. We redo the Hidden pictures, and all of the puzzles as well. I highly recommend this magazine, I just wish it came out more often!"
5,This Is An Excellent Book!,"This is a better resource than you'll realize at first. The author sounds kind of goofy, but if you pay close attention and take notes like he suggests, you'll realize there is a wealth of exciting ideas here. The information is practical for a working band because it is designed to make you more money right away. The material is also well organized. I've read other books of this type, and I found this book immensely more useful and inspiring than the others I have read."
3,More appropriate for GRADES 4 to 8.,"While this book is an easy read and provides good insight into SM for older readers, it is not appropriate for children as young as 4 (as indicated in the product information provided). It is too long, contains too many references to the title character's behavior chart system, and fairly uninteresting pictures to engage the attention of youngsters. I have used it to a limited degree with some kindergarten girls, but I had to adapt the verbiage and skip some of it completely in order to hold their attention. In the end, they voted more forWhen My Worries Get Too Big! A Relaxation Book for Children Who Live with Anxiety.Understanding Katie might be somewhat useful for a young child with SM who is already on a chart or token system, but not really a good read for other youngsters. The treatment guide available as a separate purchase is great information, but too expensive for what it is, in my opinion."
4,Parents review,"I bought this book for my 8 year old daughter who has selective mutism. Both of us liked the book however I had to read this with her. The book is probably written for a 10 years or older. I didn't mind reading it with her but she likes to read alone so she found it abit overwhelming, many long words. I think if it was meant for a girl her age it should have had less words per page and more colorful. But overall a well written book and lets her know she is not alone.Understanding Katie"
5,"Mr. Wetton's Best Since ""Voice Mail / Battle Lines""","Give this one a chance, and it is easily the best solo album John Wetton has turned in since his 1994 opus, ""Voice Mail (Battle Lines)"" -- if not his best work ever.Quite frankly, I wasn't so sure Mr. Wetton had this left in him. The sheer beauty of it is quite stunning. There is a theme, that if you program out the one clunker (""Nothings Gonna Stand In Our Way""), from the orchestral beginning to the a capela closing, is really quite touching.The standouts are the title track, ""Take Me To The Waterline"" and ""When You Were Young."" I can't really say enough nice things about this CD. If you happen to have [extra money], the Japanese import is worth it for the live cover of ""God Only Knows"" -- which, combined with the vocal flourishes and the Four Freshman-inspired closing comes as close as Mr. Wetton has ever come to matching his hero, Brian Wilson."
1,avoid,"As one of my favorite singers for over twenty years, it is time for John to throw in the towel. Welcome to Heaven was unlistenable and this is not far from it.Maybe Virgin/E'G can release some unreleased UK or King Crimson sessions. That would be worth the money."
5,Chase. Nuff said.,My oldest brother got the first album for christmas in 1970. I was ten and the next year had a trumpet in sixth grade band. I'm 52 and still playing. I have given young trumpet players these discs for free to expose them to good musicianship and skilled playing. The reactions have been the same. Jaws drop!! Mine still does after 42 years of listening to it. Always share your knowledge. Don't keep it to yourself.
5,Lost Gems,"This is actually two albums in one. They are the little known follow ups to Chase's self titled first release. With no real clear cut single hit neither album received the popular attraction of the first album...too bad. This one is just as good. Fans of ""Invitation to a River"" will be just as enthralled by Chase's journey through the Greek Gods. ""Pure Music"" is more of an instrumental release. Though the lyrics to ""Run Back To Mama"" may not play well in this politacally correct world. A must buy to complete your Chase collection."
5,GREAT MUSIC AGAIN,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST TRUMPET ALBUMS ANYWHERE. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A C D FOR A LONG TIME FOR CHASE AND HAVE NOT FOUND ONE UNTIL NOW. SOUNDS GREAT LOT BETTER THAN I REMEMBER MY 8 TRACKS SOUNDING HA HA. A GOOD FRIEND FOUND CHASE FOR ME A LONG TIME AGO JOHN ETH,HE A GREAT TRUMPET PLAYER ALSO. BUY THIS ONE IT IS GREAT. THANKS"
5,WWII book,I wanted this book to add to my rather large collection of World War II books.It adds another layer of understanding and insight to that period of history.
1,Fake,"This product is fake. The company distributing this item is not the actual company, Joico. I have had trouble finding this product recently, since even salons can't seem to get the real product. The REAL K-pak is thick, luxurious and smells like bananas. It's an incredible product which works better on my hair than anything else I've tried (my hair is very long, thick, and wavy). The product contained in these bottles is fairly runny with an odd chunky texture, a different scent, and does not produce the same results. I am disappointed because my mom ordered this same item and received the real product, while I ordered it several months later and received this cheap fake stuff."
5,Excellent Daily Conditioner for Colored/Dry Hair,I have Fine/Thinning Asian Hair that is blow dried every morning and colored every 4-6 monthes. This conditioner doesn't weigh my hair down or make it feel or appear oily. I tend to keep the conditioner on my hair a little longer than recommended too!
5,This is the conditioner I always go back to,"I have fine, dry, breakage prone hair and this conditioner is great at keeping it healthy. I find that when I use this and keep heat styling to a minimum, I can go up to 4 months without needing a trim for split ends which is amazing for me. If you look at my hair sideways the ends split. To me, it smells like pineapple which I like, but isn't overpowering and goes away as soon as you rinse it out. If you're looking for a more ""heavy duty"" conditioner I would really recommend you give it a try."
2,Not a very good conditioner,"I have used joico for quite a while now and I have never had any complaints about this product. As a matter of fact Joico is the greatest hair product I have ever used. I dont like this conditioner as much as ""moisture recovery"". My hair is curly and it needs to be conditioned in order to look good, but it seems like it is drying out. It says it right on the bottle, It can only be guaranteed if bought from a professional... at LEAST buy it from AMAZON themselves. Than you know your getting the right product."
2,Causing frizzy hair,"Pros: Smells good, like banana creme or something.Good creamy textureCons: Makes my hair very frizzyEvery time I use this conditioner my hair is really frizzy when I dry it. I switched it up with Garnier conditioner to see if it was my hair or the conditioner and sure enough, my hair is soft and shiny w/ Garnier conditioner but dry and frizzy with this stuff.However, I am also using Joico Kpak deep penetrating Reconstructor once a week and love it! The reconstructor is helping my dry, over-processed hair heal beautifully. I recommend buying the deep penetrating reconstructor and using a different daily conditioner."
2,Screwed up my hair,"I tried the shampoo and conditioner because my hairdresser recommended it when I was having a lot of split ends. I've never had an issue with my hair tangling, but after a few weeks of using this stuff, I started to get this enormous rat's nest in my hair and my hair felt like straw and lost its shine. As soon as I went back to my old shampoo/conditioner, I did not have the problem again. Unfortunately they don't make my old shampoo anymore so I have to experiment again. If you decide to use this, keep an eye on your hair and stop using it if it does not improve the health of you hair."
5,Great model!,"The Naboo Starfighter model has some great unique pieces and is very durable. The kit also includes the bricks and instructions for a second, smaller model which makes this a very good value!"
2,Lego Star Wars Episode 1:Naboo N-1 StarFighter W/Vulture Droid,"Hello,as you may know this is a Naboo StarFighter,and a classic modeld vulture droid from episode 1.That`s two ships to your collection!Small features inlcuded.Here are the minifigures:Anakin(boy,new hair,short legs,new face)Naboo PilotR2-D2Here are the features:Vulture Droid turning wings(turn small wings)Vulture Droid walk mode(pull down the complete wing)Vulture Droid Aerial mode(pull up the complete wing)Vulture Droid Flicking Missles(flick from back)N-1 CockPit(remove wind shield)N-1 R2-D2 drop-off(Pull down switch from bottom)N-1 Flicking Missles(flick from under)N-1 Mini landing areaPros:nothing is too good about it.Cons:Two pilots for one N-1 Fighter is pointless.Overall:Not so entertaining."
3,anchors flyweight,I wish they were sturdier to compliment the quality of the screws. I would not recommend or order product again.
5,Extremely informative !!!,"This book covers all the ins and outs of a disease that is just as much a mystery now as it was years ago. This gives detailed information about what to expect in testing, physician's appointments, symptoms, different treatment options and how to cope with the fact that you have a chronic disease."
3,Living w/Lupus,"Well,since my hands are involved w/my lupus I can't actually READ this book.They need to make these things on audio or readable on the computer."
4,Great album about corporate takeover,"This is a brilliant album that I'm sure alot of small town people can relate to. During this generation, alot of towns and rural areas are being taken over by corporate companys, which result in loss of homes and jobs.The album itself is completely different than Bright Eyes, or anything else Conor Oberst has done. Its more of a fast paced album with roaring guitars and drums. I highly recommend this album for any fan of Conor Obersts work. Add this to the collection."
5,5 stars not enough,this album is so amazing i don't even know how to tell you how great it is. fevers and mirrors is one of my favorite albums of all time but read music/speak spanish gives me the same lyrical intensity and genius with more rock and roll. if you love fevers and mirrors there should be no reason why you won't love this album. if i could write a poem/song as beautiful as conor oberst i could die happy.
3,"It's Good, What More Is There To Say?","This album is good but just not anything excellent, just like Bright Eyes. But Bright Eyes manages to be really good while this album from Desaparecidos manages to just be decent. Let me say what is bad about this album. First of all the speaking parts before and after some of the songs are just horrible, sort of like with some of the 'funny' speaking parts on Queens Of The Stone Age's ""Songs For The Deaf"" Another problem I have with this album is Conor Oberst's politically and social rantings, these are obviously not what he is good at writing and almost come off as [bad]. Despite all of this the actually music is pretty good, reminiscent of the late At The Drive In. Full throttle songs like Manana, Greater Omaha, ...make this album worth burning."
5,PURE AND ABSOLUTE GENIUS,"This album is yet another masterpiece from Conor Oberst. I first heard them after I began to listen to Bright Eyes. When I heard about Conor's newest band, I knew it would be worth getting. The album is completely different from any Bright Eyes cd which is in many ways refreshing. The whole cd is much more angry. Gone is confessional storytelling, and to replace it is fervent outrage against the consumerism consuming America. Desaparecidos expresses their anger incredibly well, and the outcome is an incredible album."
5,holy....,"This Bright Eyes guy (Conor Oberst) can EMOTE! This is not just another emo band, Oberst brings every bit of spit and spirit a human can possibly acheive and channels his rage into lyrics that are just as engaging. The music is great simply because it can keep up, Oberst's shrieking and singing is just that powerful. Like I said, this is not just emo in the sense of bad relationships, the lyrics are about the soul sucking evils of capitalism, the chain corporations encroaching on the beauty of the whole planet, and most importantly, how it takes its toll on our life and relationships. Like what the Clash did with punk, Desaparecidos are doing with emo, stretching its horizons, and broadening its vision. Feels good to be alive."
2,Boring and silly,"Not a good sitcom. Every character in the show but Emily was nuts or just plain stupid. Every plot was goofy. Didn't care for it.Didn't compare with other comedies of those times. All in the Family and MTM was 100% better. Yes, sometimes I thought MTM should be called the Ted Baxter show, because unlike so many others who loved him, he got on my nerves mainly because there was way too much of him. The repeats in the writing for him were pretty boring, and often I fast forwarded it. But all in all, with the exception of too much of Ted and his goofy girl friend, I liked the show a lot, especially Lou Grant, Mary, Rhoda and Phyllis. I remember years ago, they come on right after each other. I watched them both, but really didn't care much for the Bob Newhart show. I think his 2nd show about the his guest house was a little better."
3,This was one diaper - large - rather than several smaller,"I was disappointed because I didn't realize that this was one large thick sewn-together diaper rather than heavier weight single layers which are more flexible for the relative that I bought it for. She joked that she could cut it up and use it, but that wasn't my intention. I won't purchase this again. I think if you're looking for a large diaper all-together, this would work for you -- it does seem like a solid product. I just couldn't tell from the description what it was I was going to be receiving."
4,Great read and insight into the ways and means of General Washington,"Buchanan's previous ""The Road to Guilford Courthouse"" was an assigned text for a course on the American Revolution. After reading ""The Road to Valley Forge,"" the latest of Buchanan's works, I'm completely attracted to his marvelous writing style. He is a joy to read. His analysis of ""The Great Virginian"" (Washington) as tactician, strategist, and commander-in-chief is particularly insightful, accurate, and straight-forward... and so can be well-appreciated in these days of author opinions strewn haphazardly over landscape of history."
2,Large Rockets,"I bought these to have in addition to the three rockets that come with the Geospace pump rocket. However, these rockets are way too big to work with it. They barely make it pass the air shaft. The three rockets that come with the set work fine and are plenty."
2,"dull, coarse, worthless cutting teeth","The saw looks nice and the reversible feature is good, but when I attempted to do a trial cut on soft pine stock; it would not cut the material smoothly. The teeth do NOT have any true cutting edges. The blade teeth were: stamped,and offset. There is no sign of any beveled cutting edge to cut the wood. The teeth just 'RIP' through the fibers leaving a very rough edge and a jagged line along the cutting path. This saw should only be sold in a 'DOLLAR STORE'! I plan on returning it."
5,Excellent for VMM adoption,"I started working on VMM early this year. Got couple of books but this books best among all. This doesn't teach you VMM basics but once you understand basics from other book or manual or trainings, this is to become expert. This book gives very nice practical examples."
2,Not what I expected...,"I mainly got this book for the salary statistics, which totaled about two sentences in the book. You can find more, better, and less-dated information for free on the internet."
4,Good guide for the aspiring PA,This book really pointed out the different fields in the PA spectrum. It's a great guide that breaks down the vast opportunities in the field. It's an easy read with no complicated language. User friendly.
2,sorry but mostly a snoozefest,"i wanted to like it and was def in the mood for a good comedy and i like matthew but it just didnt come together for me and i really didnt care about these ppl. and never believed the Jina actress (i never heard of her b4) was a english doctor of fish or whhatever she was suppose to be. wasnt even amusing to me, just boring. i got up so many times to get a bite to eat and to type this as i was that un interested in this flick. guess it will go with the other 100 for sale in the used section."
3,Good buy for the price,"I purchased two of these black nightstands to go in our bedroom. We just moved into a new home and did not want to spend $200 or more on each nightstand, so these seemed like a great bargain! They arrived within a week, and we got free shipping through Amazon. It was fairly simple to put them together, but you do have to be careful not to over-tighten any screws. The wood is rather flimsy, but we think they will hold up for a couple years use until we can buy something better. They do look good from a distance. You get what you pay for!"
5,beautiful love story,This movie is worth seeing ...He is so sexy I just dont have words for it... YUMMY YUm Yum YUM
3,a bath bar,"looks good and reasonably solid except the plastic at the end of the bar which inserts into the wall bracket. This is small, has no spring loading and allows for no flexibility, therefore be careful when installing"
4,I liked it despite its divergence from pure Known Space,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a slightly different universe than pure Known Space. I happen to like Benford, despite his slightly unpolished style compared to Niven, or compared to some of the other authors that contributed to Man-Kzin wars. (In particular, Mathew Joseph Harrington really nails it - check out ""Peace"" and ""War and Peace"" for the best Man-Kzin action to date - ties together Pak, Outsiders and more. HIGHLY recommended).That having been said, I liked this book even more than the segment that appeared in the Man-Kzin series. If you have experience with Benford and can tolerate his foibles, get this book. If you are a known-space purist, just read the section that appeared in Man-Kzin Wars VII. Both are great, and the imagery of the earth ship fighting the three Kzin craft with a system-long directed spear of fusion flame is compelling."
3,Known Space by those who Know Space but not Known Space?,A pretty decent Known Space story with some decent characters and an initially exciting premise leading to a letdown. Weak ending. Shine it on
2,Too much information,"The problem with this book is it ""reveals"" all the mysteries of Known Space back to before the Big Bang -- the ultimate spoiler. Worse, it's neither a very convincing or interesting set of revelations. A bad idea, with mediocre execution."
1,"Very, Very Very poor viewing quality. DON'T PURCHASE!","It said it was remastered but it was not. I only paid about 3.00 USC for this DVD, so not worth the trouble of returning item."
5,beautiful watch,I am satisfied by this product. It is a beautiful watch for the price. The product arrived in a good condition as expected. very happy and will be a good present for the loved ones.
1,Thiis item was not received! Please resend this watch to my mother as it was never received by her.,I am visiting my mother and the Seiko Women's watch SZZC44 that I bought her for Mother's Day was never sent to her. Please send this product to her! or send a refund to my payment back to me. This is most disappointing and upsetting.
2,Very Poor Quality,"I purchased the Seiko watch about 3 years ago and loved it because it was so beautiful. The Seiko I had prior to this one lasted 25 years until the band broke and you can't get a replacement because Seiko no longer makes them. After about 2 years, of owning the new watch I noticed pitting on the watch case! One year later the pitting on the case is SO BAD, it looks like a piece ofcheap junk. The pitting is not on the stainless steel case,(back part of the watch you remove to change the battery) but on the REST of the metal case, i.e. - the sides, around the watch face, and extends into that part of the case that connects to the metal strap, including the first and second links of the metal strap.This is supposedly water-resistant? If I'd known this I never would have purchased this watch and I will never buy another Seiko again, if this is any indication of their lack of quality."
4,Superscope PSD220 is super,We have been using the Superscope PSD220 for about 4 years and it has been great. With the remote it can be started or stopped from on stage (line of sight)and the remote can be strapped on a costume or wrist. I love the fact that when one track is done I can program it to stop until I press play again. It will play CD's I create on my computer or store bought.
2,Mediocre At Best,"Paavo Jarvi's reading of Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring"" is too soft-edged and not vicious enough. This performance makes me think of Michael Tilson Thomas, because it's just way too easy-going and doesn't have enough bite. That said there are obviously better recordings than this one: Seiji Ozawa/BSO on RCA, Bernstein/NYPO on Sony, Levi/ASO on Telarc, and Stravinsky's own reading on Sony.The reading of Nielsen's 5th is also pretty weak. Jarvi fails to capture the Nordic essence of the symphony. Herbert Blomstedt's reading on Decca is, in my opinion, the benchmark. Jarvi fails to bring the kind of excitement this symphony needs to make it convincing.All of this said, the audio quality is excellent and the playing from the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra is excellent, but these two factors cannot save this recording from the dismal conducting of Jarvi. Buy at your own risk."
4,"Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring / Nielsen: Symphony, No. 5","Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring / Nielsen: Symphony, No. 5 is a 2004 Telarc recording under the direction of Paavo Järvi who leads the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. On this recording we get the pleasure to listen to Stravinsky's Rites of Spring and Nielsen's Symphony No.5 , Op. 50. A very competent recording but sometimes I feel it lacks the passion that is need for a perfect classical recording. Still I recommend it. 4/5."
4,"Coffee Table Book: Cool Pictures, Ode to the 90s Hip-Hop","There's not much to say.... basically it's a huge picture book with little quotes and blurbs about each artist. It's fun to look at an just to have as a random hip-hop 90s source of inspiration if you want that. I sorta wish it had more pictures, but overall cool coffee table book.Like another reviewer stated- the bios for the artist were sub par. And the quotes and text entries for certain pages seem to be for looks only, not for actually reading. Which is cool and not cool at the same time... because since its a book I want to be able to read any relevant content.. now if it was a cd cover or something then I'd understand.I gave it four stars because it does serve its overall purpose as a photobook, but I wish there was more quality content to read about each person."
1,Waste of Money,"I downloaded this eBook with the hopes of getting my money's worth. I was sorely disappointed. This .pdf file is ""52"" pages long; however most of the pages are only 1/2 to 1/4 of the way full. This entire file could have been compressed down into about 10 or 15 pages, rather than 52.The information provided inside this book was lackluster to say the least. I am a very proficient computer user, with Windows XP Professional running on my pc. The ""tips"" provided are so basic that they are almost laughable. I just wish I could have previewed the eBook to know what I was wasting my money on.The only redeeming quality is that even though I did waste my money, it was only $[amount] down the drain. I would recommend this book only to people who are using XP for the first timeand have no idea where to start. Other than that, buyer beware!"
3,Tight,"I bought these jeans hoping for a nice look but I could not keep the weight off so I ended up giving them away. Don't blame the jeans. Give them a try, they're nice."
4,Misery yet hope!,"Mary's story is one misery yet hope. Mary was captured by Native Americans in an attack on a small Massachusetts town during want we call King Philip's War."" The more I read about this ""unremembered"" war the more interesting it becomes. I recommend first reading one of the many books on the history of this time period and then read Mary's account. It will help you to better understand what some of her references refer to."
1,Not what I expected,"It arrived quickly which was nice, but again, it's small and not what I expected. certainly NOT worth 20 dollars."
1,Ultra Lousy Picture Quality,"Lady Frankenstein is a great movie, but this DVD release does not do it justice. The picture quality is the worst I have ever seen. It is as if they recorded the DVD using an old, used VHS copy of a copy of the movie. The picture is pixelated and most scenes are so dark you can hardly see what is happening. Don't bother buying this DVD, it is unwatchable. Maybe someone will release it in a better quality in the future."
3,Bit disappointed,"I haven't tried any of the stories yet. But looking over the table of contents I am disappointed in the selection of stories. I thought this was a holiday book. Lots of them are generic. And while April has a story for Arbor Day, it doesn't have Easter. Seems to go a bit more towards obscure holidays. So if that's what you're looking for this probably isn't the one for you."
4,Great spice organizer,"Love that all of my spices are now easily found, alphabetized, and organized. Frees up cabinet space, and doesn't take much room on the counter. Would have given it a 5 star if they used easily found fonts to create custom labels."
1,Frustrating Purchase,"Let me start by saying I don't hate the item but having to try and get a replacement cap for one that arrived broken was a nightmare. Amazon offered to take it back and replace it but it was to close to Christmas and it was a gift. I had pre-filled the spice jars to give as a gift. I asked Amazon if they would assist in contacting the manufacturer for a replacement part. They said they could not but said the manufacturers are expected to deal with such issues if they sell thru Amazon by agreement. When I contacted the manufacturer J.K. Adams directly they asked me to pay for the broken cap on a newly purchased very expensive 48 jar spice carousel. I would have expected them to take a cap off one of their bottles, put it in a bubble pack and send it on it's way. Guess not!"
2,no spices,"I may be dense, but I assumed this would come with spices. The picture and price led me to believe such.I was all ready to do some good cookin' tonight, as it had just arrived. Instead I'll do some good spinning of my empty jar rack.The hardware seems nice though, but, 'what the hey'?great."
2,An Interesting Plot with Anachronistic Teen Characters,"I am only on page 50 of this novel, and consider myself a Highsmith fan. What I find most annoying about this novel is that, having been the same age as the protagonist in 1983 when the book was written, I can safely say that no teenagers spoke in the language that her protogonist and his friends speak in. It's as though they were transported from a 1941 and are forced to use words like ""mightn't,"" ""stocking feet,"" ""Why are you so down-in-the-dumps"" that only a woman of Highsmith's age would use. This is especially troubling because I love the plot and the religious conflict she creates (so far), but the teenagers' personalities seem false and contrived for 1983. Even the party scenes seem less MTV/Friday Night Videos and more like leftovers from the 40s MGM musical ""Good News."" The teens even hang out in what seems to be the equivalent of a malt shoppe. I can't recommend this book. She should have researched the lives she attempts to capture."
3,Distinctly odd,"I've always placed Highsmith as a writer of the 50s and 60s. This book was published in 1983, and it's set in a peculiar version of the early 1980s in which characters are named Arthur and Cora and Mildred. It's also a peculiar place where high school students are offered beers and hot toddies by their parents and a teenager works at a neighborhood shoe repair shop. A place where an ex-boyfriend refers to his ex-girlfriend's new flame as ""Mr. Hargiss."" Highsmith was in her sixties at the time, so perhaps she felt a contemporary setting would update her unique brand of unease, but she doesn't quite make it. For example, she confuses ""angel dust"" with cocaine. Unfortunately, the bizarro-world details distract from the story, about religious fundamentalism and small-town gossip. It's still a good read, just a distinctly odd one."
4,Third-person Highsmith,"This is an interesting work, if you're familiar with other Patricia Highsmith novels - and by ""interesting,"" it is that it's not technically a crime novel (i.e., it's not the major theme of the novel), it's another display of the range of her capabilities, rather; also, that when the crime is committed, it's not from the person from whom we're watching the events through - it's sort of a third-person crime, in this way. And not for the usual reason. (I'll leave it there so that, even though another reviewer has told you who the killer is, the novel hasn't been completely blown for you.)""People Who Knock on the Door"" is still a very readable novel, since the differences don't really detract from the reading - it has the same storytelling style of other Highsmith novels, and is not a labor to read for it.If you're looking for a ""Deep Water""/""This Sweet Sickness""-esque suburban psychopath tale, you may find it slow and ultimately disappointing.But if you aren't, read on!"
1,shipping rip off,"Yes the lowest price, also the highest shipping. Shipping is hidden you have to look for it, Amazon should make all merchants post shipping up front for the consumer."
1,Subscription never arrived,"I ordered this for my husband - and made the mistake of telling him about it - but it has never arrived 11 weeks later. Supposedly Amazon is following up on this but I'm more than a bit ticked. In all fairness, I've never had a problem with anything I've ordered through Amazon before. I will update my review if and when the problem is resolved..."
1,sBE CAREFUL if ordering a gift sub,"the publisher of this magazine makes it extremely difficult to speak with them if you have any problems. in my case, a gift sub for my father was mistakenly mailed to me. after 2 emails and 2 voicemails, i was finally able to speak to a human who suggested that i mail them to my father myself. they've finally changed the address, but apparently don't care when they make a mistake and as a company simply cannot afford the few cents it costs them to send another one out, in the name of customer satisfaction. really lowbrow stuff. maybe in spirit it's actually it's Excellence: The Magazine About Pinto."
1,have not received,"Typically, I am the biggest Amazon fan out there. I have not, however, received any notice of my subscription other than the charge for it.I did not use the gift option to order this for my husband, which was my mistake. When I contacted the designated customer service to explain that I wanted the recipient's name changed(not the address)as well as some notice that the magazines would be coming, I received no response.I assume that we will start to receive after the stated ""6-9 weeks delivery"" but the lack of response is disappointing."
2,Don't know what the other reviewers are raving about,All of the prior three Habib Koite CD's and three of four performances I've attended were mesmerizing; this one is hardly that. Not a single track inspired me to copy it to my music library. Don't spend your money.
4,A Unique Perspective,"A long time student of Camus' works, I thought I knew everything there was to know about this man. However, this book along with ""Albert Camus and the Minister"" have left me with a fresh perspective on Camus. Not to say that it destroys the image of the man that other works personify, but it does work to fill in the gaps and in some cases bring to light new things about a well known man, of whom little is truely known."
4,Excellent Bedtime Reading!,"I have always been a horror fan, but it was not until reading the Hot Blood series that I really realized that horror and erotica could go together very well. Dark Seductions is definitely a book in that same exceptional genre. The stories are, for the most part, very well-written, with a ""creep factor"" more than just going for the ""ick"" or ""gore"". The sex scenes are written for plot and not just tacked in there to sell a story, and the stories themselves are short enough that you can read the whole book in one night or portion them out one ""thrill"" at a time before bed. all in all, very enjoyable!"
1,Not What the Title Promises,"I purchased this book with the expectation of getting turned on and being scared at the same time. Neither of these things happened with this book. The stories stopped just short of being sexy or horrific. I did read the whole book to give it a fair shake, but it never went anywhere. I think anyone seeking horror or erotica stories would do better to buy each of the genres in separate books."
2,you get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for... the first light I received was did not contain all the parts & would not work, the seller promptly sent me another that did work. The flashlight works fine & is bright enough, but the laser pointer quit working on the 2nd day."
3,Good for the price.,"This is a good flashlight though I would not buy this if you expecting anything great. The laser pointer is extremely weak and as for the use of a flashlight, it does work well but, you're not going to get anything spectacular. For the price though it is decent and will more than likely meet your expectations."
2,CHINA MADE,"THE LED LIGHT IS GOOD, BUT THE LASER WHEN I PUT IT ON I DONT FEEL WELL. HOPE I DONT GET A TUMOR.NOW I DONT PLAY WITH THE LASER LIKE I DID WHEN I FIRST GOT IT."
5,Very Edifying,"An excellent book, chock full of the sort of obscure and disgusting words that I wish I could recall at the right times."
5,not an enema!!,This book was the only Christmas gift I received this Yule season (and I have more friends than any other stercoverous xanthodont smellsock) that did not induce hypereccrisia.I did not feel the slightest bit huskanoyed!!Bravo.
4,Good price for a cool vinyl,"I like the design and the price. Side 1 is not bad, Side 2 is where the money's at though. Good single. I don't normally buy singles because it seems like once you walk away from the turntable it is already time to flip the record."
3,Molly Hatchett - 'Cut To The Bone' (Sony Special Product),"A decent (not great) but okay budget priced CD to give true fans a taste of the 'live' Molly Hatchet experience. Sound quality is very good. Tunes that you're sure to get plenty of enjoyment out of when driving to work, across town, etc are ""Flirting With Disaster"", ""Long Tall Sally"", ""Satisfied Man"" and ""Good Smoke And Whiskey"". Obviously, this disc features some of Hatchet's lesser known tracks. Sure miss original vocalist Danny Joe Brown (R.I.P.)."
2,Cheap and nasty greatest hits CD,"This is just another one of those cheap and nasty CD releases from Sony to make a quick buck. The cover makes it look like a live CD. But, it is just a ""greatest hits"" CD.The CD is 42 minutes long and sound quality is surprisingly good, but not excellent. The packaging is cheap, with no liner notes.The CD covers about 10 years of Molly Hatchet. The first five tracks are from the early early years and fairly good. I have always enjoyed their version of Gregg Allman's Dreams (even though it isn't as good as some of the Allman Brothers versions). The Creeper has always been a favorite.The last 5 songs are from later in the group's life and are just tired and stale. Sweet Dixie sound just like a retread of Flirtin' With Disaster.In later years, Molly Hatchet would sometimes veer away from the Southern Rock sound to a more conventional corporate rock sound that was popular at the time. The results were not very successful."
1,this is not the soap you see here.,"i expected to receive the same soap and packaging that they show. instead i got the new soap from ivory that anyone can buy at any store. they pulled a fast one on me. DO NOT BUY getting the old original soap is impossible, so do not waste your money."
1,BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Did NOT get what I ordered, order was canceled. Seller decided not to offer what he put up for sell."
4,finally found,"My father has been looking for this dvd for a long time. He really enjoys,so the rating is his since it was purchased as a gift"
3,Your Cheatin' Heart,I was very happy to get this on DVD. I have been a big fan of Hank Sr from the time he played on WSFA in Momtgomery. In my opinion he was the greatest country singer that ever lived. I have read a lot of books about Hank. The movie left out a lot. But I guess they can't put everything in.
1,BBB compaint filed against company for false advertising,"A warning to anyone considering purchasing any products from Franklin Covey. Franklin will be discontinuing products used on Outlook. The products are failing at an unprecented level. You will not receive support for products you purchase and will be directed to purchase the online subscription.A complaint has been filed with the BBB for false advertising. Additional, a class action lawsuit is being prepared as well. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY"
1,"Good Idea, Bad Product","Unfortunately, I agree with all of the negative reviews for this product.It is a good idea, if you can get it to do what it claims CONSISTENTLY. My version, 5.1 on XP, crashes for no apparent reason and I cannot seem to get the 'recurrence' feature to work on a consistent basis. I don't mind so much the fact that it is bloated with icons that overcrowd the page if FC would provide updates that fix the issues mentioned in the other reviews. I really want to use this product but I am close to just ditching any hopes for a fix. This is a shame. I cannot recommend this at all."
1,This product is garbage,"I used Franklin Covey Ascend in the late 1990's with great success. It allowed me to electronically print notes and tasks, had a nice compact calender, I could update every day at the beginning of the day, print tasks and yesterday's notes to my Classic planner, and have everything I needed to take with to meetings and so forth. No more. 5.0 for Windows can't print the daily notes (tries to print hundreds of pages if the notes exceed 1/2 page). No margin control. No font size control in printing of notes in other tabs, everything prints in six-point type with no margin control. I paid for the software and a new planner, and after 3 months threw the whole thing in the garbage. On top of that, it isn't stable in XP or Vista. Slow to load,once loaded, slow to change views.Franklin Covey Plan Plus for Windows is useless and a bad product. Don't buy it."
4,A great bigraphy with pics,This is a great biographgy telling one how the boys have started and what their lives were like. Plus it has some exclusive photos that are very cool.
4,Bounces beautifully,Purposeful rock ragas capable of simultaneously looking backwards and forwards in musical history.
2,(sigh) sad,"I've liked Hellborg's other musical endeavors, but his newer album's have something wrong with them. The word 'lame' comes to mind. 'lackluster' is another. 'Monotonous'. Ok, it's boring. The stuff with Shawn Lane and Shrieve is great. Get it."
2,For die-hard Karloff fans only,"To be honest, I haven't seen Karloff in more than a couple non-Universal movies, and I'm beginning to think it should stay that way. For the casual fan of classic old horror movies like ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Invisible Ray,"" this film will most likely be a letdown. What the other reviewers say is true: the picture and sound quality are great. I guess what's missing, for me, is the creepiness and otherworldliness I enjoy so much from the Carl Laemmle classics. Here we're presented with an interesting plot, but little flare."
2,Monkey business,"Vintage Karloff, but not as memorable as some of the others. The chimp has some of the best lines. This will be of interest mainly to those who admired Boris for his ability to play these parts so well."
4,Great overview of main legal issues for managers,This book is amongst others used at the Stanford MBA course as an introduction to legal issues that may arise for managers in a variety of business situations. It is comprehensive and is well illustrated with landmark case studies and relevant hypotheticals. Constance Bagley takes out most of the cumbersome legalistic language and makes the complexities of US corporate and civil law understandable.
1,not worth it,There are many better books out there that are easier to follow and comprehend if you are not a law student. Not impressive.
5,Facinating Seeing Cancer Demons attached to people,"Easy to read. only 100 pages or so. Book is crammed with Spiritual insight and how to defeat deoms and cancer using the Name of Jesus Christ. By a minister of 30 to 50 years.A MUST QWN as a reference booklet, Hagin saw things in the spirit world and I can verify some of his stories with my own 20 years of ministry."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was immediately caught in the story, though at the beginning I had a hard time with David Sands falling for this mysterious woman he spies through a window. When I read the back of the cover, I expected more of an intense mystery but found it more of a suspenseful emotional journey and erotic romance. Still I was captivated by the characters and truly wanted to know how things were going to end. As for my reservations regarding David falling so deeply for the woman so quickly; well let me put it this way, the ending answered all my questions and quashed all my doubts.Lost HoursThe Friday HouseXiii"
5,skeedust,"You have taken me on the ride of my life with this story.The setting of this story is now and the reader has to hang onbecause of the up and downs of your people because they arealive in the reader's mind..............I could see,feel,smelleverything...................thank you.waiting for the next one.................."
5,Beautifully told...,"Jasminium was the first book I read by Jonathan Luckett and I read Dissolve shortly thereafter.One of the amazing things about Luckett's writing--both Dissolve and Jasminium-- is that his style allows you to immerse yourself into the lives and emotions of his characters regardless of your own ethnicity or background.Once I finished reading Dissolve, I truly felt connected to David and Nona. Their story was beautifully told by Luckett--holding me captive from beginning to end. Most definitely a must read."
3,"Love the book, but not the British bent","I bought this book after reading its other Amazon reviews. I really like the book, and have found it to be thorough, well-organized, and a simple 'how to', covering a wide variety of areas that are important to puppy growth and well-being. A great starter book! BUT I did not realize that this book would come directly from the UK, hence many of its internal references and language, etc., are British. It's not a big deal, but I would have preferred to buy the 'Americanized' version, and in fact I did see it later in our local stores (and cheaper too, by the way). If I want other books in this KISS series, I'll definitely check our local stores!"
1,Don't waste your time and money!,"I bought this fan less than a year ago. It looks great and has nice features BUT after one week, the fan just stopped while oscillating. It never turned on again so I returned it and got the same model (bad decision). This time it took about 2 months for the fan to stop working. I figured out a way to get it to work again by manually twisting the fan, but it won't properly oscillate without turning off. Bottom line, this fan is terrible. Invest your money in a more quality fan, I am."
2,did not last long,nice features--worked well for about a year then started making really loud rattling noises. Had to throw it away.
1,Awful!,"We bought this video because we thought it would give us some useful background information about Moldova in preparation for our one-year stay there. But the video is just awful, amateurish and overall disappointing. It turned out to be a really boring film, mostly with still pictures, about really uninteresting, superficial, shallow personal detais (for example, their eating a meal at McDonalds, or how they met their Moldovan host family in Alaska, etc) that could be of interest only for their own friends and family. The first 15 minutes of the film do not even mention Moldova; it is simply a pastiche of this couple and their life in Alaska, Hawaii, and New York. Very little film, few pictures, or information about Moldova itself. I would really like to get a refund. This DVD is a complete waste of time and money. This is the worst documentary we have ever seen. Quite frankly, I am shocked that they put such an amateurish, narcissistic DVD up for sale."
3,Worthwhile education on the physical things that make us human,"This book picks out various physical features (per the title, as well as other stuff) and traces how they evolved in our ancestors and how they contribute to making us human. It's competently but not brilliantly written at a level that will appeal to laymen. I found it interesting, and I suspect that those who find the description interesting will like it. I read the Kindle version, and the digital conversion hurt my book experience. There are numerous typos from conversion, enough that in a few cases it interfered with my understanding of specific passages. At this point in technology, images in Kindle books are never great, but the illustrations for this book were worse than average when translated to the Kindle.Recommended, but not a barn-burningly great book."
2,Not so good,"I don't quite understand all the positive reviews of this album. Their first self titled CD was great- a nice mix of C-Clamp and Braid. This however, wants so badly to sound like Shiner it ruins the whole thing. The songs aren't as well written as the first album and the singer has clearly spent weeks in the studio tracking his vocals again and again in order to sound like Allen Epley. Trouble is, he's not as good a singer and whilst he manages to pull it off on some tracks, others like 'The Halo Befriends Me' are practically unlistenable. The guitars lumpen and vocals never quite hitting the right note. That said, there are some good tracks but the whole thing is so patchy it doesn't stand up to repeated listens. A shame."
4,Good read,"I really enjoyed this book. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is everything ended perfectly in the last 5% of the book. People that have had life long staunch religious beliefs all change their minds to more open thinking in just one conversation with Greer and Noah at the end. I like that the couple actually got a long for most of the book. I don't like the books where they go back and forth between being open and then being cold to each other. These two actually admitted they loved each other and were working through their issues together. I also liked that Noah was a minister, but also a man, and made it clear to Greer that he could be both without being less of either.I would definitely recommend."
4,Nice and roomy shelter,"Put this up before winter set in and use it to store my boat and other items in it. It was relatively easy to erect and had my two younger sons help me out. However, the directions were not very clear, so I had to use some common sense to figure it out. After some initial confusion, we finally got it and it erected quite quickly. Make sure the ""L""-shaped feet (4 of them)point toward the inside of the shelter and not to the outside. I gambled on that one, and got it right, whew! Start with three sections, and then add one section at a time until the end. Make sure that the width at the base is exactly the stated width of your unit or the cover will not fit properly. Other than the poor set-up instructions, this unit is great! It is good quality material and structure. I think the additional roof support with the cross-pipes is much better than other shelters. Just be sure to pull the cover snugly and evenly on both sides. Now we wait to see how it performs with heavy snow-load."
3,"Relieved pain, broke out in rash","The product relieved the pain in my lower back. I was amazed at how fast it worked. My skin however didn't like it though because I developed an itchy rash everywhere it was applied. I stopped using it and after a couple days, the rash went away. My chiropractor gave me Bio-Freeze which helped with the pain (not as well) and did not break me out."
2,NOT WHAT I NEEDED/WANTED,"I am 75 years old, with very thin skin. I bruise very easily. I was hoping that this product would stop or minimize the bruising. The following text is copied from the product's box:(begin quote) Uses -- For relief of muscle aches and stiffness due to minor injuries, over-exertion, falls and blows. Reduces pain, swelling, and discoloration from bruises. (end quote) I have not found this product helpful in preventing or minimizing discoloration from my bruises caused by very slight bumps to my hands and arms with no pain or discomfort."
3,arnica ointment,"I bought this product to help relieve pain in an arthritic shoulder joint, but found that it was not effective. I believe it would be more effective for use in muscle pain."
4,Works wonders,I suffer from neck and back muscle tightness and soreness. I have been searching for relief for over a year and a half to no avail. I was given this cream by my acupuncturist to use as needed. I applied and right away my neck and shoulders felt relief. I worry about taking a lot of ibuprofin and now I don't have to. I would recommend this to anybody suffering from chronic muscle pain.
1,Not what I thought it was.,"So I saw on Dr. Oz that Arnicare cream was good for sore muscles or what not, but this stuff doesn't do anything for sore muscles. It would be better to use for a massaging cream, but don't expect it to melt your pain away."
2,Does nothing for me.,"Nice cream, non greasy - but does nothing for muscle pain. I feel absolutely no effect. Maybe it works for some people but not for me."
5,arnicare cream,the arnicare cream is very good product to reduce the bruses i receive because i take plavix as a blood thinner.i have not experienced any side effects while using this product.
3,Arnica Cream,"I got this because of my pain from Lupus and arthritis and my husband's pain from old work-related injuries. It seemed to be as effective as Ben Gay or any other OTC pain relief cream. Except, Two Old Goats analgesic lotion is miles better than anything else I've ever tried and works in seconds, so we've gone with that."
4,GREAT for aches,This cream is wonderful for aches and pains. It does not have an odor or leave skin 'greasy'. Would buy it again!
3,Boiron Arnica Cream,"This cream is for muscle soreness. We have used the gel in the past and I thought I was ordering the gel, but received the cream instead. My husband likes the gel better because it absorbs into his skin better and works wonders for his muscle sorness. Will order the gel next time around."
5,"Rare, intimate look into the contemporary art world","I was fascinated watching this documentary on the life of Allan Stone. This film is poignant, funny, personal, and an important contribution to the history contemporary art. I loved going into the mind and life of a famous art collector from the point of view of his daughter, meeting his family, the artists he represented, the careers he launched, all giving you such a rare and intimate look at the art world. Visually, this film is beautiful-- the art work, the shots of the collector's house and all his bounty. The film is so rich with images that when I watched it a second time, I saw paintings and art works I had completely missed originally. I highly recommend The Collector to anyone interested in art or psychology or how to give up everything to follow your passion."
5,Irresistible Obsession,"Genuinely true to self, Allan Stone is exposed through his daughter's lens as possessing an irresistible passion for human expression in art.The kind obsession of collecting could destroy him and his loved ones. Instead, they fall in as a troop enlisted and the audience too acquiesces. The contrast of endearment and possible frustration due to the collector's intense preoccupation gives the movie its undying tension and the length of the documentary is mysteriously diminished to an almost brief opportunity to feel tenderness. Our diverse group left the preview enamored, feeling as if we knew the man. -Meg Ryan"
5,Six Days in January,"I read this book in 3-4 days- while working 2 jobs.I think that Mr.William Cooper is definitely a breath of ""fresh air"" to the world of reading.The subject the Mr.Cooper chose to write about is one that is often thought of but never spoken ""too loudly"" about.Thank you for writing this book and I cannot wait to read the next one"
5,Sucks you into the world of the book,It's one of the books where you can put yourself into the roles of each charactor. You can identify with each one of them and the emotional turmoils that they go through. It keeps you anticipating more.
2,Did I miss something?,"This book started off slow. I tried to finish this book, but the author kept focusing on the same thing. This book had no story content and was VERY predictable. I am pretty much a good judge at pageturners, this one wasn't even close.I read three chapters and headed back to the bookstore with it. I would not recommend it."
5,Eye opener,This book was excellent!! It's so different from the many books out there. It lets you realize there are good guys out there who want to be with that right woman. It also makes you realize it's ok for a man to express his feelings too. That could be through words or tears. This book is the beginning to black people opening thier eyes and feeling comfortable to express to thier love ones thier emotions without feeling scared to a negative reaction. I recently met the author and I have madd respect for him beacuse he truly wrote it from his heart. Good Job!!
2,Too short = 2 Stars,"The footage is grainy, the audio terrible. The doc. spends way too much time rambling on about the locals and the porters, way too much time on the trek in. I'd say there's about 15 minutes of actual climbing footage. Add this to the fact that the 1975 American expedition failed in it's attempt of the NE ridge , and it's just not that entertaining. Where in God's name is the documentary about the successfull 1978 American ascent ?"
1,Not worth the price,"I bought this for my 7 year old- who is a Pirate's of the Caribbean nut- as a birthday gift. He already had the Queen Anne's Revenge which is about the same price so I thought they would be good for battle. The size of this boat is about 8"" long and the micro figures are about 1"" tall. As my son put it, ""What a rip off!"" We sent it back and he didn't even complain."
5,SEVEN DAYS IN MAY? GREAT READ,"I was reminded a lot of SEVEN DAYS IN MAY when reading this, except this had a lot more action. The West Point and Special Operations material was very realistic as the author is both a graduate of the Military Academy and a former Green Beret. Sure to make the old grads roll over. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
4,I guess it was OK at times...,"The line is definetly not Bob Mayer's (AKA Bob McGuire) best novel. I found that the book was OK for the most part, but sometimes I would just put the book down and groan at the unlikely plot and the obsession of the characters for a certain diary that was the key for the entire plot. Oh well. However the commentary about West Point life had a lot of credibility since the Author is a West Poit Graduate himself. Read it if you're a Mayer fan"
3,Travel with Barry & Corinne - New Russia Part 2,"Saw part 1 & part 2 of this series and as it first said it was an amateur video but it was entertaining enough. Considering the whirlwind tour they were on they did manage to capture quite a lot of the local flavour on film. There was perhaps a bit too much reference of their surprise to find that Russia had all the usual trappings of a modern society and it wasn't the Iron Curtain veiled in secrecy that was imagined. Yes, it's just a regular country after all. Not a bad flick but a bit dated now."
2,Trading Books,"As an experienced trader who has bought thousands of dollars of trading books from Amazon I found this one less than impressive.This is not about Chaos. This is not about trading Chaos.One of the other reviewers says ""It's interesting to note that in this new book, the chaos-derived indicators (alligator, AO, and fractals) are not changed.""Given that these sexily renamed indicators are just moving averages and macds with tweaked parameters then its not really surprising. For a real book by a real trader try ""Trading Day by Day"" by Chick Goslin. For ideas about how to trade try ""The Ultimate Trading Guide"" by John Hill of Futures Truth. For psychology try one of Mark Douglas's books or Brett Steinbargers book.Good luck in a tough industry :)"
3,"Readable, but far from compleat","This book is not about chaos theory, nor trading chaos, but a trading book with the first 95 pages about trading psychology, primarily Zen and Tao based, and the rest 133 pages of a trading system that comes with ""Metastock"". As a trading book fan and a Chinese who know Zen and Tao well, I do like the first part of it as food for thought, and definitely not as reading material to sharpen my trading edge. I doubt whether the very vague Zen or Tao approach taken by the author can be well understood and practised by western traders. Furthermore, I agree with a previous reviewer that the ""trade with the trend/flow"" concept preached by the author contradict a little bit with his own quasi-countertrend system presented in the second part. So, I suggest those who dont have access to Metastock nor Omega Tradestation facilities should give it a pass. It's definitely not a smart way of investing if one puts money on something that does you little good."
2,too philosophical to a trader like me,"I've been trading for more than 5 years since my graduation from college. This book offers lots of questions for philosophical speculation. Indeed, it raises many doubts about our assumptions upon this reality we reside in physically, mentally, or spiritually. Nevertheless, I will not position this book as a guidebook or a know-how methodology for beginners. This book was written or structured with a strong philosophical implications. Some chapters are nothing more than anecdotes of successful traders which I personally don't find appealingly entertaining or useful to my personal account."
4,A Must Read Book,"A great book for every must read trader. I would've gave this book a 5 star rating only if they had produced the charts in color to make for easier understanding than my having to color it. The explanations were great though I had hoped the author would label the charts to what he was referring to, and some of the explanatiosn seemed to contradict how he chose some trades. Otherwise than some of my complaints, it's a must read book."
4,The New Professionals: Technical Treasure Trove,"Having my own home based business; I was interested in an expert's point of view. Boy, did I get it. I liked the book for its multitude of facts and figures about the industry. But for some, it might be too technical. It's a must read for anyone who is on the fence considering a career in network marketing. The writing on the wall is clear; our profession has enabled masses of people to gain time freedom, financial freedom and a perfect meld of home, business and personal values. Read this book if you have any doubt regarding network or multi-level marketing. Charles W. King and James W. Robinson have made it crystal clear in their book that 'The New Professionals' are here to stay."
4,Very Collegiate View on the Industry.,"Network Marketing has always intrigued me and never did really listen to the naysayers of this industry although in my opinon It is true there is alot of 'BAD' companies out there and also products in my view should not even be aloud to be distributed through the veil of Network Marketing. After reading this book it really solidfied my view on the industry and I believe as an industry it truly works!! People need to do their due diligence and look at the company, the product and keep their eyes and ears open about the management of the company who might have a good product but managed poorly and you are sure to be destined to failure and people who believed in the company will then say that this industry is a corrupt pryamid scheme!!!"
5,Great support for new marketers,"Of all the network marketing books I've read, this has by far been the most helpful. Why? Because it deals with the real issues that cause difficulties for new marketers, the bad press, the non supportive comments from family and friends, the inevitable periods of depression that come when one is in a self-motivating business, and above all, the necessity of a good team. It IS important to keep one's attitude positive and this book will help you do that, by helping you look the negativity of others and on occasion yourself, straight in the eye. I give it to all of my new downline!"
2,A rehash of two previously published books under a new title,"Beware Tran. Having bought it here believing it to be a new book, I discovered that it is merely two earlier Pournelle and Green novels (Storms of Victory and one other) republished under a new name. (An annoying practice, to which the Baen Book company is especially prone.) I had liked both of those books when I first read them, but not enough to buy them twice. (It should be noted that the book does warn you of its contents on the back cover -- caveat lector or net buyer."
4,why the bother,a pointless re-issue of a book that should have had a sequel years ago... unless the authors are planning to resolve the dangling plot lines some time in this century it isn't worth reading..
3,WHERE DOES THIS FIT INTO THE JANISSARIES SERIES?,Does anyone know where this fits in with the rest of the Janissaries series? I thought the series was put together as follows:JanissariesJanissaries: Clan and CrownStorm of Victory (Janissaries III)Is this book a combination of any of these or another title in the series?
3,Helpful supplement for a child's education,"Peril and Peace is a brief introduction to the early church aimed at children ages 8-12. The style is narrative (dramatic even), interspersed with some historical reflections on martyrdom, the formation of the canon, early creeds and councils, etc.Chapters include stories about Polycarp, Justin, Origen, Cyprian, Constantine, Athanasius, the Cappadocians, Ambrose, Augustine, Chrysostom, Jerome, Patrick, and Benedict.This could be a helpful supplement to a child's education. In particular, it might make for good summer reading for a Christian child in public school (unlikely to be exposed to this aspect of church history).That said, as an adult, it wasn't a great read. Was ready to be done with it."
3,Book review,"It's the book that I needed, but is not in the best condition. But, a book is a book when it comes to college students!"
1,Buyer beware,"If you are expecting to get the full version of ""Disco Nights (Rock Freak),"" you will be disappointed. Unfortunately, there is nothing on the packaging that indicates that the version of ""Disco Nights"" is a radio edit instead the original album version (which exceeds 8 minutes). This is inexcusable and lazy, and one of my chief problems with compilations: the producers often are lazy and place edited versions of the artist's most important singles on the compilation, and use the saved time to add filler material. This practice is particularly egregious here because (a) there is no notice to the consumer on the packaging, and (b) in this case, the full version of ""Disco Nights"" was on the album (instead of being a specially commissioned 12"" single remix). In my mind, the only reason to purchase such a short compilation is to get the full version of ""Disco Nights,"" which is G.Q.'s most notable single."
3,Best of GQ,This cd contains all of their best work and their (GQ's) music is hard to come by in certain markets of the country. For those of you who enjoyed the 70's and 80's music this is a must for your colection.
3,I do love you,I love the music just brings me back to the good old daysamazon is the best place to find the music that I looking for
4,Great,"Wished it had a little bit of additional information, but overall the best for Text Forms and Features so far."
4,Great Tour DVD,This is a great tour and will try to take it when in CA -- More hopefully will come out of the serie
3,Relaxing but not daytime sounds.,"It's not something I would listen to during the day, but I must say I find it very relaxing and fall asleep easily with this CD.."
4,Relaxing,"This album is great for relaxing at the end of the day, as well as for background music while writing. It would make great music for those who have a massage or spa business."
2,really narrow!,"I tried these shoes I couldnt even put them on because they were too narrow and small. My feet are a little wide but even though I'm a 7.5 I was triying the 8 and I couldn't put them on. I tried other heels that were 7.5m and most of them fit!!!Actually, those were the only heels I couldnt put on, very uncomfortable, kind of cheap too, agree with the other unfortunated customer."
2,Too tight,"I remember how excited i was when i ordered this pumps, but imagine my disappointment when i received and tried it on and realized that i couldn't hardly stand in them for a long time because,it was just too tight. I tried to force myself to wear them and walk around in the hopes of breaking into them. It just never loosened up, so i gave it away. Maybe it was just this shoe, because i have another Two Lips sandal and it doesn't hurt my feet at all."
4,Well made,"These are hex keys, and there is not much to say. I like the holder, which makes it easy to find the size you're looking for and is great for organization vs. throwing them into a box somewhere. They are hardened steel so they don't round off, and fit snugly into my bolts.At this price, I will buy another for my son who has a new house and needs tools of his own. You won't be disappointed with this product, as long as it is what you need. If you want Torx, then this is obviously NOT the product."
4,Submarine Titans,This game is a classic. It has beautiful artwork which could easily be made into a screensaver. My only complaint is that a sequel was never made. It would be awesome if it were ported to run natively on Vista or 7. This is a game kept in my collection as a reminder of fun RTS at its best.
4,Have a listen............rockin'billy good time,"With the imminent release of ""Roll On"" to the American market it will hopefully generate interest in The Living End's previous work.This is an excellent EP that is a lot rawer than ""Roll On"" but showcases the songwriting talent these guys have.This is an E.P to crank up loud and bounce around to in your living room or at a party.They draw on a variety of influences from AC/DC to Midnight Oil and there cover of The Cures ""10.15 Saturday Night"" is exceptional.You will not be dissapointed if you buy this C.D ,and if you get a chance go and see them live..........you will be blown away."
4,Surprisingly Satisfying,"I have never played the original Spyro games, but I was attracted to this arc because of the story it told. When I first purchased it, I did not know how combat-centric it was going to be. Admittedly, the gameplay does get rather repetitive after a while, but the game makes up for it through its lush visuals, great voice acting, and compelling, epic storyline. The whole thing plays out like an animated movie; the combat sometimes seems like an interlude between the different sections of the story. You have unlimited lives, which helps, and you can utilize your different breaths in a variety of ways. While not everyone will be satisfied by this game, it is definitely a solid entry to a famous series."
3,Legend of Apyro A New Beginning,I like the game to have less fighting and more story but I am still playing it
2,Waaayyyy too short,I've loved all the previous Spyro games and was really excited to get this new one. It only took about 4 hours to finish....very disappointing.
3,What? Its Over?,"Wow I loved this game from the beginning with the great graphics and melee attacks... but then 7 hours after I started playing, the game was over! I've played every Spyro game so far and this is the shortest one yet. It was very dissapointing. They had a great game going, but stopped the action too soon. Too short."
2,Fine game for 5 year olds,"I loved all the other Spyro games I've played. Then I played this one. I was highly disappointed. I beat the game in about 6 hours of actual playing time. There were no special levels, no puzzles, no anything except unchallenging combat.The developers spent more time on cut scenes than anything else. While the dialog was entertaining, I don't buy games to watch mini movies. I buy games to PLAY. I think I spent more time watching cut scenes than playing the game, actually.This game is likely a lovely starter game for children, since you never truly die and get as many do-overs as you can stand. If you're over 5 or 6, it's a waste of your time."
4,by far the best I've tried,"I bought many (MANY!) brands for my grandmother and these are the best. 4 stars only because they are not completely leak-proof (not sure this is even possible though?). They are bulky - not a problem for my grandma but may be for others who want to be more stylish. A little expensive of course, but you do get what you pay for."
5,Amazing,"My brother is a Vietnam Vet; bitter, troubled and disillusioned. This book touched something deep inside him that only another Vet can touch, open and heal. I don't know if he will change his life but I do know that it opened up conversations that we would not have had without the influence of this book. It's a quick read. There is some language and situations described that can be disturbing but Mac is telling a true part of his life. He doesn't sugarcoat it. Thanks Mac Gober."
5,Vera Wang online,I really like this item and it smells real good. This is the first time I've purchased this item online but it won't be the last time. My wife really like the way Vera Wang smell too. Great product!!!
5,Memories,"It was a favorite of my mother's and became a favorite for us kids (now in our late 30s). Old and young alike will delight in this heartwarming and cheerful Christmas album. Be sure to sample the tunes available and you'll see what I mean. If you're tired to the traditional tunes, turn back the clock and enjoy this one. A tradition for our family was listening to this album while putting up the Christmas tree, on mom's birthday 12/15."
3,Not what I expected,I am new to the world of Colognes (16 years old) I had recently bought a fragrance from bath and body works called 'noir' which is a very woody type of deep good scent. Tommy is more of a fruity smell which I didn't expect and it seems to fade out rather quickly and smells a little cheap. Any feedback on what i'm feeling would be great!
5,The way a man should smell,"I've been wearing this since freshmen year of high school, and I've never worn something that will stop women dead in their tracks and say that I smell good. What I like most is the subtlety of the fragrance. It's not over powering, very light and fresh smelling. When i received it through Amazon, I had put it on that day and that evening I went to go have a drink with some buddies. This women said she couldn't help but tell me that I smelled amazing. All other colognes I've tried were too strong, and have been described to me as if I'd taken a shower in the fragrance, but not Tommy! I highly recommend this product after all my field tests, and it's fairly inexpensive for what you get. Everybody is different, but in my opinion this is the one for me."
4,Worth grabbing if you can find it.,"Contrary to the info given above, this album was originally released on Columbia Records (with different cover art) in 1959, not 1967.This is a good specimen of the type of pop-instrumental Christmas album that was omnipresent in the late '50s and early '60s (see also Percy Faith, Ray Conniff, etc). Those of a certain age will undoubtedly have memories of hearing this stuff on radio or in department stores during the Decembers of their youth.Kostelanetz's second seasonal LP (1963's WONDERLAND OF CHRISTMAS) is even better, but that one unfortunately has never made it onto CD. Still, if you can track down a copy of this long-OOP title, I would highly recommend doing so. His ""Sleigh Ride"" alone is worth the purchase."
1,Poor sound quality...,I love Nazareth...But the quality of this recording sucks...It sounds like it was recorded inside a tin can...This is a shame because what could have been an excellent concert(recorded 2002)has been reduced to audio crap...Shame on BMG for this one...Nazareth deserves better...
2,be careful about this one!,"this is a 'taster', a best of if u will, of live cuts from naz's back to the trenches and live at the beeb. good sound overall, but i would buy the original sets as there are bios and interview with the band on those...no background info whatsoever on this one."
3,Decent Pack,My husband and I used this for a 10 day trip to Italy. It held up fairly well but wasn't extremly comfortable to carry around. The metal tips fell off of a few of the straps. And the straps on the back were hard to adjust as they kept coming loose. I wouldn't load this pack too heavy. If you want something for light day use--this is a good pack. Not so much for what we needed it for.
3,well protected in a package,"well protected in a package. looks not very elegant! the communication is good ,reply is prompt .looks good on the pic of Amazon,and it is not very so when I receive this one"
1,Misleading Instructions,"Chaney Instruments/Acu-Rite brand 3166.The instructions and packaging leads you to believe the temperature is displayed on the remote. For those who smoke for hours, having the temperature is crucial to the success of the product. In the BBQ world the meat is ""done when it's done"" and not usually based on a preset time. The instructions show an example of the remote with the temperature but this only displays the time and never the running temp. If you want the temperature, you'll need to go check the base unit -- pretty much defeating the purpose of having a remote. You might as well get a plain digital thermometer which isn't wireless for a third of the price. This product clearly wasn't designed by someone who cooks. I'm sending it back and trying another brand."
3,Needs Minor Improvements,"The product does what it says, but lacks some minor features that would make it better. 1) The timer will count down, but not up. 2) The manual is poorly written. 3) The base unit does not send the current temperature of the meat to the remote unit. The thermometer unit needs to communicate with the base and remote wirelessly. The wire extending from the meat to outside the grill / oven is cumbersome, and precludes its use on rotisseries. All in all , a good value."
2,"Not ""All That""","I am quite the shampoo and conditioner aficionado and let me tell you, this stuff ""Ain't all that"" get the Caviar moisture line, its much better. This shampoo left my hair dry when I rinsed out, and the conditioner just doesn't compare to the Caviar line. Too bad, I had high hopes for the stuff. I have very fine, thick hair, medium length."
1,All Hype -- No Results,"When I spent five times what I normally spend on shampoos and conditioners, I expected to receive notable results -- ESPECIALLY since both bottles proudly exclaim, ""Observe extraordinary results after just one use"" under the directions.In addition to having a scent that I'm not exactly thrilled with, I am very disappointed with the results. I probably would have received the same results if I'd purchased Suave at the grocery store."
5,WOW!,I could not believe how much thicker and managable my hair was after just one use! I have colored hair and this product has done the best on my hair vs any others. Just give it one try...you will be hooked!
1,"I would be happy to review, but cannot, since I never got the order, despite email exchange on the subject","I would be happy to review, but cannot, since, a month after I placed it, I never got the order, despite email exchange on the subject"
4,Another great addition!,"I like the Joes representing the various services. With this Guard GI Joe, the only drawback is that you can only play with him one weekend a month and for two weeks every summer."
5,Classic performance,Robert Goulet embodies the wonderfully warm approach to a song. It is a nostalgic trip into the Christmas music most baby boomers remember of the sixties. Beautifully arranged and performed.
3,Spyro: Why no cheats?,The game is fine but my child wishes that there were cheat codes available to by-pass certain parts of the game when it becomes difficult.
1,Disapointed spyro fan,I have played all the other spyro games and enjoyed them greatly. this one is terrible!! Not even worth renting! They have turned it into a fighting game and not even a good one.
3,FUN but played thru fast,I beat this game in 3 days....it was fun while it lasted but it didn't last very long. Not worth more than $10.....
3,Not as good as the heros tail,"Impressed with easy story telling and kid friendly Hero's tail, we purchasedthis and were disappointed to a certain extent. I think they overdid this one. Too much talking, bit too difficult moves for kids less than 10 yrs.Overall it is not bad but not as good as the Hero's Tail."
2,Not the quality of most Tracie Peterson books,"Maybe her other books had me spoiled, but this one never did hold my interest...ever.Rainy Gordon and her twin brother are tour guides in the Southwest. Rainy is living with the ghost of accusation of theft. She spends her days among the very things she loves, yet has been accused- again- of stealing. She meets a man with similar loves and just when she thinks she has found the man God has picked out for her, she learns he has been paid to spy on her. Suddenly his attention and even his kiss mean nothing. Or do they?I would still give Peterson the benefit of the doubt and purchase another book, but truthfully, this one was terribly, terribly lacking."
5,A Serious Look At Games.,"This is the most intelligent book on any aspect of the video game industry, that I have yet had the pleasure of reading. This is written by someone who knows, who cares, and who enjoys what he does. The aspect of gaming covered in this particular book is, the role of Japan in the history of gaming. It starts at the early days like, stuff you would never even guess at, and progresses through the years, to this generation. This book is from 2004 so, it doesn't cover how the tsunami impacted the Japanese people but, it has everything else you could want to know and that's a promise!"
2,Not Worth The Money,"I thought this would be a video of him singing the sounds, it is just music playing. It is not worth the money for a DVD. It could have been a plain CD instead."
2,Old,"This dvd is ok. The music is great and the sound and quanity is good, however surpise Mr. Mayfield was boring."
2,A useful review for you dial up gamers out there.,"When you read the blurbs located in various locations on the box it states that:Breakthrough technology allows you to play on a 56k connection as ""smooth as silk"".I read that and thought, ""Ahhh, the replacement for Counter-Strike and Battlefield I've been looking for!"" Not true. Apparently silk is not as smooth as I was lead to believe. Don't misunderstand me, however. When I was able to get into a game I enjoyed it very much. Usually I was booted within five minutes by the hosts of the game for high latency. Normal ping was around 300-400 on the smaller servers. Trying to play on the larger servers with 100-150 players is impossible on dial-up.If you have broadband, which most people do, you won't experience these problems. If you are stuck with dial-up as your internet connection don't buy this."
2,"Nice game, but....................","Looking for a war game that has realism, most of the current weapons of todays army, and vehicles (including helicoptors) that you can ride? This game has it all!! BUT, you'll find yourself respawning countless times in fustrating, after fustrating attempts to get on the battlefield with those weapons and rides. Soon after getting the hang of things you'll find lag and more experienced players kniving and shooting you back to respawn time and time again. I've played far cry and countless other war games and this one is for the very very very patient. Team play, yes, this game has that too However, no one actually uses the controls to ""team play"" and you end up one for all and all for one throwing as much firepower, grenades, and missles as you can just to stay alive for 2 seconds.If you don't mind respawning 100 times a match, enjoy semi-teamplay (I use the term very loosely), and firing up to date weapons, then this game is for you."
3,Potential!,"This is game with a ton of potential. I played the beta and demo before I purchased it. (The beta ran much better than either the demo or retail version) Unfortunately it has 1 major flaw, Frames Per Second. On servers larger that 64 player, the game will often fall into the single digits for FPS. This makes the game competely unplayable. This is NOT tied to any hardware specs on my PC. I have done a fair amount of research on this and come to the conclusion that it has to do with the changes in netcode that were implemented for the retail version. I suggest you go out to the Nova logic forums and check the sticky notes on FPS issues. There are hundreds of posts all saying the same thing. FPS sucks on larger servers and when there is significant fighting going on. The most frustrating thing of all is Nova has yet to respond to any of these posts.Once Novalogic addresses this issue it will be an awesome game. Until then I'd wait until there is a fix."
3,Greedy Novalogic - LAN users beware,"I have a LAN in my home, and I bought this game looking forward to playing it with my wife. I was pleased to find out that the CD did not need to be in the drive to play the game. But, after installing it on both computers, I could not connect them via the LAN. Turns out you need as many copies of the game as you have computers. This is verified via the CD-key you use to activate the game. To me, this is cheap on the part of Novalogic. Why shouldn't I be allowed to play the game I purchased on my own LAN with my own wife?"
2,A real review,"I swear, Novalogic has hired a slew of undercover marketers to spam sites with ""this game is great"" nonsense. I have played for about twenty hours, and no matter how much better I get at this game, I still find it incredibly boring and limited.A handful of vehicles and a major lack of terrain diversity don't help the slow gameplay which consists of running here and there, then hoping lying in the tall grass will hide you from your enemues. It rarely does, but you won't be able to see anything past the tall grass you're lying in, so the enemy can see and kill you with no problem. Then you have to wait around to be healed or you can respawn, then trek all the way back to the front. Almost the entire time is spent waitng, hiding, traveling in this game. There are many other problems in this game, too many to mention here."
1,We are still waiting for the game to be sent to the house.,This is taking so long just to get to our house it's not funny I will never buy anything from this company again. It's now going on two months FROM THE TIME I put in the order and my son is very disappointed that he has to wait so long. They sent him the second half of the game so he can't play it until the first half gets here. That is why we are so upset with this company. And I was told that they would sent it over night which they didn't. So I would think twice before anyone else should order anything from this company. There all lies just to get you to buy from them.
1,BORED TO DEATH/SCREWED TO DEATH,For the PRICE and the NAME of the maker you would expect more. This is an ONLINE game that ONLY works if you install the included SPYWHARE that sends your internet protection into spasums everytime you turn on your computer. If you played Black Hawk Down and thought that OH another title from the same people IT MUST BE GOOD well IT'S NOT!! IT SUCKS!! IT SUCKS!! NOVALOGIC should be ashamed for putting out such GARBAGE and THEN trying to SELL an expansion pack. WHAT does the expansion pack clean the BOREDOME! I think all the people who got RIPPED off on this game should express how the feel!
1,Broken twice in 1 year -- It's junk!,"The faucet has a lovely shape, but the thing is a piece of junk. I've only had it a year, and it has broken twice. The first time, something underneath the sink broke and it flooded my cabinet. It wasn't because we were rough with it. We were told, ""Oh sometimes that happens."" Uh, ok.Now, something on the section of the faucet that pulls out is leaking water from the pullout joint, down the stem, and onto the counter.It's got a great look, and a beautiful curve to the handle. But it's a piece of junk, IMHO. I know it's not from the high end of Kohler lines, but we bought it because we liked how it looked. I would have gladly paid more to avoid this hassle.Price notwithstanding, I expected much better quality from a Kohler faucet."
1,Kohler K-15160 fails after a few years.,"Our Kohler K-15160 is about three years old. The faucet was fine for that time but a few weeks ago we began to have a problem. The water flow began to slow down to a trickle after a few moments of running the water. So I found the proper replacement cartridge and purchased a new one. After installing the new cartridge the problem actually became worse. I could not find any information on Kohler's website and the web is getting to be useless for consumer help as every website wants you to ""Join"" and give up your personal information to see the results of what others have posted. Most times the result is not the answer even close to what you're looking for.I hope by posting this on Amazon, that someone with a similar problem would read this an post an answer.Perhaps the replacement cartridge was defective, but I am reluctant to keep buying replacement parts if the product has a systemic common problem!Thanks,Mike"
2,Good quality but flow not as specified,This was easy to install and adjust. The spray and stream button works fine. But the flow is in now way the 2.5 gallon/min as it states. This faucet replaced a Grohe that had plenty of flow so I know it is not due to our water pressure. I have no kinks or any restrictions in my lines so it is certainly due to the faucet. I would not have purchased had I known the flow was a problem. Who wants to wait around while it fills pots or watering cans?
2,"CAREFUL!!!, this one is fagile","Wow, very poor quality. The hot and cold lines are designed in a way that they are easy to kink when installing. Gently(!) put an extra plier on the metal end of the hot/cold hose when turning the nut. BTW, for those that are commenting on the flow rate, I got a 2.2 pgm one. I'd say adequate, but not impressive. It's hard to find something in white anymore, let alone decent craftsmanship and not pay $300+.Pros: 120 degree swing, ergonomic ""lever"" handle (15160-L is the longer ""loop"" handle)Cons: fragile supply lines (non-servicable), watch out for low flow version (1.5 gpm max at 60psi)"
3,workable,marginal flow and the transition for spray to stream is a bit of a chore. It's a fussy faucet that can stick in the transition area.
3,"Works fine, but","The faucet arrived in fine shape and installed easily, but make sure you check the length of the supply tubes.I was half way thru the installation when I realized the supply tubes were too short and I had to make a run to the home improvement store for extensions.The faucet also has a very low water flow.I have seen both of these issues mentioned on other reviews and they are accurate."
1,"A disappointing faucet, mainly plastic","This was a replacement for a KWC Faucet. Unfortunately, the flow rate is very low, even with my plumber removing the flow restrictors. Many of the parts are cheap plastic instead of metal. I am buying another KWC, more money, but probably worth it."
3,"Beautiful faucet, but you must get used to the flow restrictor!","This is a beautiful faucet (I got the polished chrome finish) and it was easy enough to install. But I'm still getting used to the dramatically restricted flow of water (this is, apparently, a very common complaint with Kohler faucets in general and this Coralais faucet in particular). The ""spray"" function seems to deliver a little more pressure than the ""flow"" function. If your home already has low water pressure, this faucet is *not* for you. But if you don't mind saving water, you can't beat this beauty."
3,"Nice faucet, but ...","We had this same faucet in white before trying the Kohler K-10433. The 10433 was a nice faucet but would splash out of the sink too much. So we went back to the corolais in brushed nickel. I did not notice the low flow in our old white corolais, but after having the 10433, I do notice the low flow on the new corolais. It is adequate, and does not splash, so not all bad. However, we liked the looks of the 10433 better, and may have been better off installing a flow restrictor in that faucet to reduce splash."
2,Very poor quality,May I send it back? I had to buy a better one and pay again to have this one replaced.
3,LOW FLOW,"If you dont want a reasonable stream of water, this is the one for you. We made the mistake of buying this faucet, thinking it would be nice to have the large sprayer head for high pressure rinsing. Not gonna happen. even turned our water well pump pressure up to maximum and still lacking in regular stream and spray. upon examination, the reason is evident. 1/4"" hole in hose and head is very restrictive. We called Kohler to no avail. finally tossed it in the dump and bought a non spray head with adequate pressure."
2,Very low water pressure,"We're on a well system, so our water pressure is low anyway. We replaced a similar design non-Kohler faucet that provided adequate pressure. With this Kohler faucet, we get little more than a trickle on hot OR cold, despite all valves being fully open under the sink. The faucet was installed by a plumber who replaced the values and fully tested the system. He showed me the swivel point in the design of the hose on the faucet that greatly restricts water pressure.Our faucet also arrived with a small blemish on the tip of the handle where the cream finish is missing. We couldn't wait for another unit though as our old faucet was broken. This was a disappointment, though.Watch out for quality, and if you already have low pressure, look elsewhere."
4,Kohler K-15160-CP Coralais Single-Control Pulloot Spayer for Kitchen,"Got this for a replacement. Kohler improved the Pullout Sprayer - by adding a slight pivot connector to allow less strain on the hose line at the connected end of the sprayer. However, the plumbed supply lines are of a lesser grade than the original meshed stainless steel supply lines. If I were to design this product. I would have the supply lines be changeable. Overall extremely well made plumbing fixture for the kitchen."
3,Coralais is a good faucet..,"It has a nice finish brushed chrome with no yellow tint like some I've seen. The metal base feels very sturdy. The size is good as well not to high. Sprayer is easy to use and feels comfortable in the hand. Best of all..resists spotting. I don't have to wipe it daily like my old polished faucet.Installed without issue with single basin sink. Purchased this on Amazon warehouse about 8 months ago and saved about $80 dollars. The condition was new to us, could not see a flaw.I removed stars because the water flow is not strong on stream, stronger on spray. Sprayer setting stays were you last had it when you shut the water off. Some people like this feature. Me, not so much, I' de prefer it reverts to stream. I would recommend this Faucet however because of the style and overall function and durability."
2,Not my favorite Kohler product...,"This faucet does not meet my expectations for a Kohler product; feels flimsy to the touch. Brushed finish is cheap-looking. Could have done much better for the money, and I have a feeling I will be spending money on a new faucet before long."
5,Kohler Faucets,"Wonderful, easy to work with and lovely to look at. Very well priced and arrived very fast. Couldn't be happier with it!"
4,Kohler kitchen sink faucet,Product looks great and works great. The only thing I wish is that it would swing farther over from side to side.
1,"Another, less satisfactory compilation","Not that far removed from their last best-of, their American label decided to release another package. The problem with this one is that, rather than picking hits, seems to have grabbed a bunch of album tracks at random, and sprinkled a few hits among them. True, this has Fahrenheit 303 - previously only available on the UK version of the first album - but if you were looking for this track, why not just get the UK version of the first album to start with? It has several other hard-to-get tracks. Frenetic and Halcyon appear on the other greatest hits album, so that's not really a selling point for this one either. Yes, all the songs here are good (it's Orbital after all), but this is a blatant cash-in, and not even a good one. Don't blame Orbital for this one; it wasn't their fault."
2,Slap in the Face,"Let me begin by saying that I am not a fan of ""Greatest Hits"" packages and compilations. I don't believe a band/artist's ""hits"" define their worth in the business. The Orbital duo deserve much, much higher accolades than a ""budget-friendly"" compilation of their well-known tracks.Orbital is an entity whose magic lies in the whole rather than the sum of its parts. Albums like ""Snivilisation"" and ""InSides"" are perfect examples of how an idea can be spread across a handful of tracks to make one hell of an album. How you feel after listening to ""Snivilisation"" versus ""InSides"" or the ""Brown Album"" can be starkly different. Different albums, different feel, etc.To mix and match tracks from their entire catalog and throw them together would be a sin. I didn't care for ""Works"" and I certainly don't care for this ""Platinum Collection"" either. Albums will always trump ""best of"" compliations. ESPECIALLY when the band or artist in question has made some of the most beautiful albums in history."
1,"Biography - Schoonover, Frank (Earle) (1877-1972): An article from: Contemporary Authors","Less info than I received with research with Google.Could only read the article, Not downloadable to be printed."
1,Chew Toy,"I bought the Big Brute chewman toy for my dog because she seems to chew through everything pretty quickly. But I had bought her one of these toys of a different brand and she still hadn't put even a tiny hole in it, so I thought I'd get her another one. Sadly, Big Brute did not last past the hour. She had already torn through its little arm and had torn another hole shortly after. I had stuffing all down my hallway. Wouldn't buy this one again."
3,If you have Wrecking Your Neck Live...don't bother,"IMO, OverKill was at their pinnacle with the Gant/Cannavino lineup. They put out two amazing albums (Horrorscope and W.F.O.) and one mediocre disc (I Hear Black), and the double live album Wrecking Your Neck featured material from all three releases as well as every prior album. The band sounded tight and bristled with aggression and vitality. Even the tracks from I Hear Black sounded incredible and really came to life on that album. This ""Extended Versions"" is such a misleading title as it's simply a trimmed-down version of that album with some great songs omitted and the track order rearranged. Do yourself a favor and just get Wrecking Your Neck. You won't be disappointed."
3,Volume control problem,"Noise reduction and sound amplification works well. The volume switch, however, turns on easily by itself in my bag and runs down the batteries. I take the batteries out when I am done shooting."
1,Poor Performance,"Not enough ear protection without good plugs in the ears with it. A guy was shooting a 223 three benches down the line from me and I had to go to my car and get my $10 Walmart Winchester muffs so I could keep shooting. The Winchester muffs are rated at -25 but they were easily twice as good as these.Also the gain control is very erratic at best. With ear plugs in, the sound quality wasn't very useful."
3,"For $70 not bad, but Radians does not stand behind them","They work fine for the money, but if they stop working 91+ days after purchase... they don't have replacement parts etc... you have to throw them away. I am happy to throw away $25 Guide Gear muffs, but at $70 the company should have a good guarantee in place. if you can find a paid for under $40 they are probably worth the gamble."
4,Works Like a Charm,"Shipping was prompt. The product quality is very good. The electronics work well. I bought these on the recomendation of a range master who stated they used these all the time.There are few small issues. First, the sentivity on these is high. You can hear the slighest sounds even at a distance when the volume is turned way down. I would imagine these would be good for hunting. They are a bit too sentitive for a shooting range where there is lots of noise other than gunfire. They do block out the bulk of the shot noise and work very well.Second, the volume controls are a bit stiff to turn on, but I can see that with use the controls are loosing up.All in all, a good value for the money"
5,Indoor shooting competition,"It is extremely important to hear everything at a competition. The constant taking off, and putting back on, conventional hearing protection is a distraction and often painful. These have made a huge difference. The first time I took them to the range, several of the other competitors immediately decided to order a set for themselves. They work as advertised and the price is fantastic. A 45 auto sounds like somebody dropping a phone book from a couple feet in the air and yet you can still hear every word spoken clearly! They are even comfortable with shooting glasses on. There is no excuse to not protect your hearing when these are so affordable. You can spend a lot of money for shooting gear, but if your on a budget (and who isn't) these are the answer to enjoyable range time without a headache."
5,Great long lasting Chime,"My 3rd music of the spheres purchase. This one was for my sister, who loves it as much as I do. THE BEST wind chime sound. I love this company, and it's made in my hometown Austin, Texas! Despite that, the best prices are found on amazon."
5,Finest Wind Chimes Available,"I totally agree with a previous reviewer that Music of the Spheres Chimes truly are the Stradivarius of wind chimes.Pros: artisan craftsmanship, exquisite tuning, long-term warrantyCons: expensive, but worth every pennyBecause I have owned an Alto set in Mongolian tuning for 3 years, which delight and amaze everyone, I thought these would be a great wedding gift. The wedding was in October, and the bride and groom loved them! I recommend them highly to all."
3,"Not as good as their second album, 'O My Heart.'","This album really showcases the bands vocal capabilities. I'm only adding eight of its tracks to my play list, though--two especially, 'Verbatim' & 'Oh Ana' SAVE this album! Try this album, but if its your first listen to Mother Mother, I recommend going with their second album, O My Heart, first!"
1,Some sizing differs!,The look is 5 stars but the sizing is completely different than Guess's other Medium sizes so when I got it it was actually too small! :(
3,"Love Alice in Chains, but the book is elementary.","I bought this book because I've been an Alice in Chain fan for years - and even met Mike Starr back in the day. And I must suggest the book for any die-hard Alice in Chains fan.BUT - the book could have been written by a 12-year-old. The type is that of a children's book. It was obvious the type was made large so the book would appear longer, but why not make the book longer by adding more meat, maybe going further into his past.The reading is definately remedial.However, it's a book about Alice in Chains, and so it's a must-buy for the fans out there.Hopefully something with more depth will one day be written about the band."
1,Get real!,"You know, a real artist would have more to talk about than getting laid. Mudslinging is rampant in this book. It seems like stabs from a desperate soul who could no longer play with the bandmates he cherished. I don't think this book is accurate. Even Mike Starr himself pulled out at the last minute on this one. I don't think we'll ever know the realtory on this great band."
1,Crappy,"I love Alice In Chains. But this book was a joke.Could Mike Starr be favoured any more???Again, I love AIC, but this book does NOT shed light into anything significant. Poorly written/researched."
1,Do Not Buy This,"Let me preface this review by saying that I love Alice and Chains and have since ""Facelift"". I'm so disappointed that I payed hard earned money for this terrible book. The author writes like a ten year old. I thought that this was a novel. A person can finish this book on the toilet in one sitting. I reccomend leaving it there when you're finished (if you finish at all). There was no information in there that any novice Alice in Chanins fan doesen't know. This book was ridiculous. The author mispells names, the writing is choppy and ludicrous. I hated it"
3,Very good,"I purchased a few Everest videos all togther. The recommendations led me to try this one. And I wasn't misled, but... I was a little dismayed when the video was half over and they were just getting to Everest. The video is about who and why people climb Everest, and what it takes to prepare (ie equipment and strategy) and how hard and dangerous it is even for experienced climbers. It is worth watching but its not a whole hour of trying to get up the mountain."
4,Great viewing!,"I only really purchased this because I'd grown up in Yakima, Wa. when Dave Mahre was operating White Pass ski resort and his sons were winning medals in the olympics.I knew of the failed everest climb and was intrested.If you enjoy this kind of thing, get this dvd. It's good quality and interesting to watch.Dave and Mary Mahre-RIP."
2,seller sent wrong item,"I ordered the Big Brute item pictured and got a different item, which my dog doesn't like as much. I didn't return the chewbone because the shipping cost was almost as much as the product cost. But I won't order from that source again."
3,Motorhead - 'Extended Versions' (BMG Special Products),"Basically, a ten track compilation of some of Motorhead's better tunes - but slightly lengthier versions, in most cases, it's usually one minute (sometimes less) longer than the original album version. Heavy hitters such as ""Orgasmatron"", Lemmy's own ""Born To Raise Hell"", ""Killed By Death"" and the seven-minute edit of ""Overkill"" appear to maybe be this disc's exclusive songs. A nicely assembled budget choice, but pretty much meant for the completists."
4,Enjoyable but.....,"not very good quality in the recording. The background noises were sometimes louder than the people talking. Especially when Ina May was talking. But, I still enjoyed the DVD and recommend it to others who are interested in midwifery."
5,"Two Killers, A Twisted Trail","Chief Inspector Lloyd and Inspector Judy Hill find themselves reliving their past when Victor Holyoak is murdered on the night he has opened an expanded factory in the presence of several VIPs.From the moment Lloyd first sees the victim on the podium he has vague memories of having seen the man with a deep facial scar in other circumstances, but with a different face.As the investigation of Lloyd and Hill progresses it is evident that no one is sorry the victim is dead, but who is the killer. Thirteen years separate the events who another low life was murdered, but who is the connection?A truly complex story that will keep you turning the pages for a fascinating read.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
4,"HoH: Good, but I'd hoped for better.","After picking up the Heroes of Horror Supplement, I have this to say: I'm glad I have it, but I'd hoped for more.Heroes of horror is a great tool for any DM wishing to add a twinge of terror to his/her campaign. The added rules, characters, feats, monsters, and discussions are truly helpful, and the art is wonderful. Coupled with the Book of Vile Darkness, (and even the Ravenloft Player's Handbook), this book becomes more useful, as the books play from each other well.My main issue with this book: Efficiency. $30 will put 150 pages of useful information in your hand. Can that $30 be better spent on another WotC product? That's the question you should ask before buying this book. I run a horror campaign, and so this book was a worthwhile purchase. If you just want to run a horror adventure one weekend, you'd be better off buying an old Ravenloft module."
3,"Not bad, but not great","The HOH manual contains a number of useful nuggets for running horror campaigns or adventures, and even has some good information for spicing up a normal campaign with elements to give your players a serious case of the willies. However, too many pages are spent discussing and disecting elements of horror, and not enough space is given to working out the actual mechanics. I would like to have seen more examples of how to DM horrific encounters, as well as how to maintain a balance between fun and horror in a campaign. In conclusion, not bad, but I'm just not sure it's worth the thirty bucks. If you want to dig into the theory behind horror, less than ten dollars will get you a copy of Steven King's ""Danse Macabre""; which covers many of the same elements."
3,Some useful ideas but nothing exceptional,This book has some useful ideas but nothing really great in my opinion. I do have better Ravenloft material concerning horror campaigns.
5,My father bought this album for me when I was a teenager. I still have it but no record player. I'm sure it's pretty welll worn,"My favorites are the non-traditional readings Yes, Patricia There is a Santa Clause, and A Cowboy's Christmas (my favorite). At a time when my boyfriend and a lot of other young men were in Viet Nam the line ""......there can't be a Merry Christmas for a man if he's not free. So this much I'll ask you Lord to do the best you can to save some seeds of Freedom for the future sons of man."" really hit home. My favorite song was My Christmas Room again, non-traditional."
4,One of the best dogs!!,"This episode was so cute and informative. Many people want a dachshund (doxie), due to their lovable personalities. They can be low maintenance, but like the episode showed, you have to be cautious with their diet so they don't get overweight and don't allow them to jump up and down couches and beds. Climbing up and down stairs is also not a good idea. Many potiental owners are unaware of these, and later pay the price because their doxie has developed back problems. This episode explains all this and also shows a doxie in a wheelchair because of back problems. If you plan to get a doxie, watch this episode first so you can have a long and wonderful life with your doxie. They are awesome dogs!!"
3,A wasted decade?,"10 YEARS is described as a comedy, but it's overall very melancholy. that is unless a fall-down drunk in public is funny, or two 28-year-olds throwing rolls of toilet paper in the bare branches of a tree like a pair of juveniles is at all laughable.For the most part these several people who attend a high school reunion are unhappy with their lives. A touching sequence where one attendee plays guitar and sings his hit love ballad to the woman who inspired it when they were teenagers is a peaceful and welcome romantic moment. Even this is bittersweet, for they never did or do get together, and his future return to Albuquerque is doubtful, as his life is taken up with endless concerts and lonely motel rooms.Although old friends are reunited and some infatuations laid to rest, in the end the main thing that's resolved is everyone is different, older but not necessarily wiser, settled in life but only satisfied to a certain extent. Not exactly as escapist film."
2,Horrible movie taking place in a span of 24 hours,"I knew this movie did not make it to the theatres but was going to give it a shot. Well I wish I could get my $2.99 back because this movie was not good at all. First off, I takes place in a span of 24 hours - which that drives me crazy in movies. There was really no plot, just four guys that come back from their lives to remember HS memories. If I were you, I'd keep my money and rent something else,"
1,Awful. Save yourself.,"Have you ever found yourself in the company of unfamiliar people talking about things you have no imput on or telling inside jokes you don't get? Not to mention you you just want out of the room because you are being bored to death slowly and painfully... For 101 minutes????Seriously, I've watched some bad movies in my life and I have to say I have a high tolerance and this movie killed me! Even Channing couldn't sway my opinion on this. I just kept waiting for SOMETHING to happen. ANYTHING!!! No plot poor character development and too much going on.I feel like its my duty to stand I front of redbox and prevent others from this!!!"
3,Boring and not interesting,"I had high hopes for this movie as I am a massive fan of Channing Tatum and many other cast members in this film (Justin Long for example), but honestly this movie was utterly boring, uninteresting and had no compelling characters. There was little plot to speak of and frankly I was anxious for it to end."
4,Just like the 10 year reunion I didn't go to.,"This movie is the story of a group of friends (and enemies and acquaintances) attending their ten year high school reunion. It's probably a pretty good approximation of what most people really experience when they attend one of these events. There are a wide variety of character personalities involved and some of the characters have grown and matured a lot since high school. Some of them haven't grown much at all. Some of them get nothing at all from attending, and some of them get a lot more than they ever expected. I didn't attend my high school reunion, so I really enjoyed watching this just to see what I missed. I recommend it very highly."
3,"Not great, not horrible either. Middle of the road comedy/drama...","10 Years was a strange one for me. You recognize most of the actors and actresses, but not really who they are. They usually play bit roles or supporting actors. The movie itself is a hit and a miss. The comedy is kind of cheesy, corny, slapstick, leaving not really laughing, only finding it mildly funny. For the better part of the movie I really didn't care for it. The saving grace was a little towards the end, when the cheesy comedy turned a little serious and became a little touching, adding more meaning to an otherwise meaningless movie. Rosario Dawson's plot line had the most impact, and she was also the one who did the best of all the actors. In the end the serious tone of the end of the movie recovered from the faltering comedy feel of the beginning and middle of the movie. Can't really say that I would recommend it, but wasn't a complete waste of time.2.5 stars."
1,Dreadful,"Totally agree with the reviewer who said the only thing more boring than attending your own high reunion is watching someone else's. Everyone acted like there was this huge secret between Channing Tatum's old gf and him only to discover that..............there was nothing other than old hs boyfriend and girlfriend meeting up again after eight years. Whooopee! There's an hour and forty long, long minutes I'll never get back."
3,Ok movie,Bought this for a Channing tatum fan thought the movie was ok he's done better but proud I bought it and shipping was great
4,Good movie,"its worth the time to watch, my husband and I enjoyed it very much and would probably watch again. good story"
5,Underrated Gem,"I thought this film was fantastic. I saw in limited release, and was a bit surprised that it didn't get a wider showing. It's funny, awkward, touching, and honest. As a child of the 90's, it really spoke to me, and I hope it finds a better following on video than it did in the theatres."
3,ok,"""10 Years,""It is a movie a bout trying to stay the same but realizing that life is about changing, growing, and living. It had some spectacular acting and the storyline was done very well. My only complaint is that this whole film has been done several times, some with Oscars at the end. (I'm thinking of the big chill)!I wanted to like this film as much as others that were done, but this updated version just didn't quite make it as far as I am concerned. I would suggest renting it prior to trying to own it. If you saw at the theater and liked it then maybe you would enjoy owning your own copy. I shall let you be your own judge on purchasing this copy.I hope this review helps you make an informed decision."
1,Refund?,"This was a boring movie... If I was able to get a refund, I would demand it. I am glad that I did not attempt to watch it in theaters, because I would have left after the 15 mintues it took me to stop watching it at home. I would not recommend this to anyone; the dialouge was terrible, and that's all the movie had to offer.."
3,Class Reunions,"It was just an okay flick, If you have nothing else to do or watch. It will kill that spare time frame. Better than doing house work."
1,Not worth the Money to Watch,"OMG, really? This is the 2d movie I've watched with Channing Tatum and both (Magic Mike and 10 Years) the plot were t-e-r-r-i-b-l-e but I can understand why I watched it because of that man, LOL."
3,Funny and Warm.,"Ari Graynor, Channing Tatum, and more good cast members make ""10 Years"" worth all 90 minutes. Alumni from Lake Howell High School set-up a reunion-party for all the old buddies, and pretty girls. Memories come tumbling and who's to say that someone doesn't fall in love all over again. One is now a singles-mom, after two divorces and two young children. Another is a writer in Manhattan, while another is a successful musician(He sings a terrific love song near the end). It's all well-directed by Jamie Linden, who's done it all before. The DVD is light on extras; a menu, 2 trailers, and a few deleted scenes are included. In ""10 Years"" these young adults find their lives, the world and everything has changed a lot in the last ten years; yet they are somehow still just exactly who they were before. ""10 Years"" was filmed in New Mexico."
4,It's always fun to relive your 10th class reunion.,It's always a good feeling when the main characters end up right where they need to be after all this time.
4,10 Years,"This is an entertaining movie with a few funny moments. I really like the cast - Channing Tatum, Rosario Dawson, Kate Mara, Justing Long, Oscar Issac, and others.Video and Audio quality is good, and there are also some deleted scene included on the disc.DVD SPECSMovie Run Time: 101 MinutesVideo: Anamorphic Widescreen (aspect ratio 1.78:1)Audio: Dolby Digital 5.1 SurroundSubtitle Option: English & SpanishSpecial Features:- Deleted Scenes"
2,Horrible,"Terrible and boring, who made this? Good stars in the moview but a total waste of time that I can not get back from watching this."
4,I enjoyed it,"Saw movie for the cast in it. Took me awhile to talk myself into it but I'm glad I did.Its not a great movie but 3 1/2 stars. So just sit back, relax and enjoy. And watchsome of your high school memories come back."
2,Disappointing,I had great expectations because of the cast... the movie was very disappointing. I would not recommend to watch even less to buy it.
4,Cute movie,Very true to what this experience is like. Actors were great. It was fun to watch. I recommend it for a date night rental.
3,"It's ""okay""","If anyone has been to their 10 year reunion, they can relate to the movie. It's a fun sit on your couch an veg movie, not an academy award winner, but good. More for women."
3,is there a plot?,"It was ok. . . But what was the point? High school reunion. . . Old friends but there is no plot, climax etc."
3,Its amusing.,"It's worth a watch, but not top of the list. It could have been a little funnier. abc def ghi"
2,The Movies Kind of Pointless,"It looked promising in the trailer, but turned out to be just a bad remake of every other reunion movie. It wasn't worth the money"
1,Painful,I watched 10 Years with my friend Katherine.At 30 minutes in:Katherine: I think something should have happened by now.Annmarie: I don't really know what IS happening.Katherine: Nothing. And. It's a problem.1 Hour in:Annmarie: My stomach hurts.Katherine: It's from swallowing all that bitterness of knowing you just lost 60 minutes of your life and have 41 more to go.80 Minutes in:Katherine: *pounds head against table*Annmarie: *points ruler at Katherine* Make something happen!!!101 Minutes Movie Ends:In Unison: Thank God!!!!Annmarie: That was painful.Katherine: Did that even make it to theaters?Annmarie: I hope not. I'd be BITTER if I'd paid money to see this in a theater. I'm bitter about the time I lost. BITTER I TELL YOU!Katherine: Promise me you'll never do this to me again.Annmarie: I'd NEVER KNOWINGLY do this to anyone.Consider yourselves warned Amazon patrons. Seriously. Consider yourselves warned.
2,ho hum,"For all the tension in the plot, it never developed. This movie is very flat. Maybe too many stories going on???"
2,Plain,This movie is ok if you a fan of the cast. It is too slow and just a plain story that gets old real quick.
3,Pretty Far Fetched,"I admit, I rented this movie for Channing Tatum, as I'm sure many people will. Yes, he was nice to watch. But this movie was filled with other great actors and actresses.I never went to my ten year reunion. I felt that everyone would still be very much like high school and that many people wouldn't have grown up yet. I look at these people at the age of 27 and 28 and think....no way...they are NOT ten years out of high school. This was way more mature than I think a 10 year reunion would be. I felt this was more like a twenty year reunion.But if you can get past that, the stories was very true. Everyone had that first love, the bully, the popular kids, the geeks. It's interesting to see everyone handling interactions as adults.I'm looking forward to my twentieth reunion."
2,Not so good,"I watched this movie with my daughter who will soon go to her 10 year reunion. Neither of us thought it was very good. She said she couldn't relate to most of the situations. Some relationships were ridiculously overdone. The movie takes place over one night that seemed endlessly long. There are a few funny places. But, most of the humor was beaten into the viewer too much. Considering I'm in my 50s I thought I was just too old to relate. But my 26 yr old daughter liked it less than I did. I don't recommend this unless you are with someone who wants to buy it and watch it. It was a way to spend some time, I guess."
2,Almost fell asleep,Just a long or what seems to be a long drawn out boring movie. I couldn't wait to the end. Sorry for the bad review :(
4,Captures real life and real people,"I read the only review posted here and was disgusted. The reviewer didn't ""get"" the movie at all and that's a shame. If he would take the time to READ about what the movie was about before he saw it he may understand the things he didn't like are EXACTLY what the storyline said it would be and IS. It's a brilliant collection of individuals who act just as real people act in the situation of the story. Jamie Linden did an excellent job capturing what a high school reunion is like and how the characters of your past change or don't!I thought the movie flew by and would have liked to know even more and be able to spend even more time with the characters. I can't wait for the video to be released and will have to add it to my library. I also look forward to the next Linden production."
4,I'm a Sucker for High School Reunion Movies,"Call me crazy but I always love movies centered around high school reunions. 10 YEARS is no exception. The cast is very attractive and engaging and the plot is, well, pretty typical of every other movie of this genre. It does not move along as quickly as, say, ROMY & MICHELLE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION, but toward the end the pace quickens a bit. There is a lot of dialogue in this film and I seemed to have a bit of difficulty hearing all the lines of the actors. Not sure if it was the sound quality or my aging ears. There were some funny parts and some heartfelt moments. There seems to be a character that almost everyone could identify with. Overall, this was not my favorite high school reunion movie, but it certainly wasn't the worst. It's worth seeing, just for the attractive cast if nothing else. I liked it and I will share it with friends."
2,I thought this would be funnier...,I was really disappointed in the pace at which this movie crept along and I really expected it to be funnier. This is clearly a case where the funniest parts of the movie are all put in the trailer. The characters were all really boring and stereotypical and I kept waiting for something to happen and this movie just never turned the corner. I think Justin Long is hilarious in Zac and Meri Make a Porno and I would suggest skipping this movie all together and renting Zac and Meri instead if you are looking for a funny adult comedy.
3,It's alright,Good showing of how reunion would be but not that gat of a movie in my opinion. Worth a watch if you're bored
2,Thank god I didn't go to their high school...,Very bad cookie-cutter film with every cliche in the book. The cute girl no one remembers. The super-couple that broke up. The chugger who can't give up his glory days. Painful...
3,About what you'd expect,"Not terrible, but nothing special. Nostalgic fun but dont really get to know the characters - There could be a good story in there somewhere if you did."
3,"Good cast, semi-interesting characters, slow","I got this vid through Amazon's Vine program because we are big fans of Channing Tatum and Kate Mara, as well as some of the other players.The good stuff: good acting from the main players, fine direction, good casting choices.The bad stuff: predictable plot, unrealistic dialogue, way too much angst for young adults. Get over yourselves and enjoy life for a change.The dumb stuff: stereotyped classmates who haven't really changed at all (bully, nerd, the girl who got away, etc.)See this if you like the cast (Channing Tatum is his usual self-conscious, hunky self, for instance) or if another high school reunion movie wallowing in its own importance sounds like a good movie choice."
4,Worth seeing....,Good story of old classmates ..... Especially like the rock star & the girl with yellow shoes in Physics class....
1,"long, boring, just like any class reunion","save yourself the time and trouble of going to your class reunion when you can just watch this movie. This movie is too long and too slow. this movie seems to go nowhere offers no story line. Recaptures a night at anytown usa 10 year class reunion, and who wants to relive that."
2,Low quality,"LOW Quality of movie. The pictures were bad. Movie had extreme low quality. I have no idea why the quality was low., I barely saw the pictures."
3,10 Years,This buddy movie was predictable and slow. Girlfiriend wanted to see this movie because of Channing Tatum so I indulged her.
3,Eh,"You have to be in a certain mood to watch this one. If you're already bored, don't do it. It will only make it worse.It might be good when you just need to relax and have nothing happen. Not much of a plot.The best part was the very end and it cut off before it even happened!"
4,Cute movie,I wasn't sure about watching this movie after reading so many negative reviews but I'm glad that I did. It' s a very cute movie. Would be good for a date night or girls night movie.
3,the movie is good...but drags at times!,I would recommend as a date night movie. parks and recreation chick is always fun to watch. Takes me back to high school!!
1,Don't waste your time,It began very boring and went downhill from there. one of worst movies ever seen. not worth the time to even review trailer.
3,10 Years,Not the greatest movie but it wasn't the wortst by any means either. Looking a Channing for a hour and a half made it worth it though.
2,Ineffective,"Did not work, container too small, usually will require 6 months for effective treatment, I would not purchase this item again"
1,totally worthless,thymol will never cure toenail fungus. I should have known better than to think this would work. It evaporates before it would ever have a chance to penetrate the nail.
5,Tammy Taylor Thymolize Works!,I've had this product on hand for years. It cured the fungus I had on my toenails. I wear acrylic nails and it will also cure fungus infections that can start when moisture gets under the acrylic. My recent order was a gift for my sister.
3,Unsure,"It's hard for me to tell if it was working or not. I used in in conjunction with Emu oil and the skin around my toe nail looks improved, less dry, but toe nail looks the same."
4,very satisfied but...,"When I first bought this I was skeptical of how often I would use it. Turns out I used it all the time! Soft leather fits comfortably in your jacket or jeans pocket.The one thing I noticed was that the clip on the small pen was so tight that it made it hard to pull out of its sleeve. So I loosened (i.e., bent it) with my fingers. Well that fixed it...too well, in fact and it started falling out. Now I've lost the pen and need to figure out how to get a replacement."
4,Great Easy to Use Handheld Slicer!,"I love this slicer, its super easy to use and clean. You can also adjust the thickness of slice too! Get it, you won't be disappointed! :)"
3,Could be better,"I do find this book helpful, however I wish it was better organized to go along with the student's textbook. You have to search through the book to find problems similar to what your child is working on, but once you do find them, it can be quite helpful."
5,Best overview of the Broadband arena I've seen,"The book provides the business professional with an understanding of the entire spectrum of Broadband technology. This is not an engineering textbook, but a book designed to provide the business reader with a foundation for understanding a very complex technology. Mr. Louis de-mystifies the subject and is able to describe both the technological and business aspects of a very complex topic.I found the book refreshing in its easy to read and conversational tones. It makes great reading on a cross-country flight. I recommend it to anyone needing an overview of the Broadband arena."
5,Broadband Meets the Business World,"This book is an excellent and unbiased technology assessment for the broadband market, without all of the technical hype and marketing rhetoric. Moreover, the timely interjection of business considerations throughout, reminds the reader that technology and business are not mutually exclusive - only a technically sound and financially prudent solution will be successful. Mr. Louis breaks down the attributes and capabilities for each of the available and emerging broadband technologies in such a way, as to provide the non-technical reader with sufficient understanding to make sound business and investment decisions about the plethora of broadband technology options.This book will prove invaluable in bridging the communications gap between the ""technologists"" and the ""financier"" - a communications gap that, in today's telecom world, has left many bankrupt entities wonder why?"
1,The Wrong Product,"When I received my purchase, the sleve was the right title, but the tape inside was different. I purchased two other copies of the title and got the right product, but it played terrible; even after trying several different VCRs. It was the ""ONLY"" video tape that played badly on any of my VCRs."
4,My mom's cat came back,"A few months after reading this book, my mom's cat, who was born in her backyard and has lived his whole life there, wondered off while she had him on vacation at her beach house. She was distraught and so was I. For a month we tried to accept that we'd likely never see him again. I just couldn't give up though. Using the lessons in this book, I tried to help him find his way back to the house (while I was 1500 miles away). Almost a month to the day from when he started his beach adventure, my mom found him walking toward her house from the bushes across the street. Ever since then, whenever I visit, the cat that was nothing but aloof and skittish around me, cuddles with me whenever he can.I've had other experiences with him and other animals in my life to validate my belief in the steps in this book, but none as powerful as that.Oh, and I'm not one most people would consider a hippy, new-age, nut. I'm an engineer with a masters degree."
4,I thought it was a great soundtrack but it's missing something......,"I searched for the soundtrack and finally lucked into it. I love the music, but I do agree with the other reviewers, some of the themes are just too short. I agree that track 3,Serenity, should have played longer than 50 seconds. I was pleased with the packaging. It would have been nice to have maybe had the tv theme song on it. I was actually surprised that they did not even play it at the end of the film. Also, I hate to say it because I was one of the people who hated this trend, but I would have enjoyed 2 soundtracks. The orchestral soundtrack and a soundtrack with songs ""based on or inspired by"" and have some songs that could have captured certain moments of the film and maybe some dialogue. Overall, I was pleased with the soundtrack."
3,"Dull, generic, everything FIREFLY wasn't","The main problem with Newman's soundtrack is that it sounds like any of a thousand other soundtracks out there. It's competent background music, but there's nothing memorable about it. Most of it would sound right at home attached to a BABYLON 5 or (new) BATTLESTAR GALACTICA soundtrack - which is exactly the antithesis of FIREFLY (and by extension SERENITY). There's no memorable track. And, of course, the unforgivable sin is leaving off ""The Ballad of Serenity,"" even as an over-the-credits song. My advice: Save your money for the DVD unless you're an absolute FIREFLY completist."
3,An OK soundtrack for a great film,"The music to Firefly was beautiful and poignant, and David Newman actually did a decent job holding on to some of the feeling from the TV soundtrack when he created the score for Serenity. However, the CD itself does not capture the soundtrack as well as it could. The CD succeeds at bringing to mind important parts of the movie. However, it feels somewhat disjointed and the transitions between themes and songs seem too fast.Regardless, I would recommend it to any fan of the Firefly 'verse, because it is great to own and listen to occasionally. Plus, the more we show support, the better the chances of seeing more Firefly in the future!"
3,"""Shiny"" among ashes","""Shiny"" bits here and there. The Score works much better IN the film, than without. (Duh!) Workmanlike background music with occasional charm of original ""Firefly"" TV scores."
3,not as powerful as the TV series soundtrack,"While I love Firefly the TV show, Serenity the movie was a disappointment on many fronts. The soundtrack was one of those disappointments. I can't for the life of me understand why Greg Edmonson wasn't brought back to score the movie.There are a few strong themes in the Serenity soundtrack. I think David Newman scores the fight scenes particularly well, giving them more energy. However, much of the soundtrack is forgettable.Overall, I definitely recommend the Firefly TV show soundtrack, but this soundtrack is only for hardcore fans."
4,Great Soundtrack,"The soundtrack to the movie is wonderfully done. It captures the movie well and is a nice addition to any collection. David Newman did a superb job in creating this soundtrack.I would have preferred a score written by Greg Edmonson, the composer of the TV series music, but this one is also very well done. It doesn't tell the story quite as well as the TV series music, but it is still good. The TV series music seemed more down to earth and told the stories of the characters in the series. This CD sounds more classical and movie-ish."
1,Bring back Greg Edmonson!,"I'm glad I'm not the only reviewer here who realizes that the score to Serenity was an absolute spit in the face to Firefly fans. Greg Edmonson's score to Firefly was as much a part of the overall aesthetic as anything else, and was, in my opinion, importantant enough to be considered the 11th character of the show (after Serenity herself and the cast). It gave the show a feeling all its own, one that was terribly missed from the feature film. I can only hope that if any more Firefly-related projects come to light, the Joss & the studio come to their senses and bring back the genius that is Greg Edmonson."
2,Lover of film scores way disappointed,"I was terribly dissappointed with the CD. I enjoyed the score during the movie, but all that action noise should be left off the CD! I would have bought it no matter what. What I do is program tracks 3,4 and 19-23 and repeat for a decent taste of the score without completely blowing my ears out. That's about 12 minutes of fairly nice listening."
3,"Not bad, but not the best","I was expecting more of ""The Phantom"" than what's on this CD, but all in all it's not that bad. Not worthy of five, or even four stars (which should be reserved for more thematic works), but this score is actually enjoyable.Scores that play with the action, such as this one, usually only have a few defining moments or instances of real clarity, and to be perfectly honest the only tracks on here with any discernable themes are 14 and 19. They're certainly the most enjoyable.The rest are a conconction of orchestra and vague synth, again playing with the action or mood of a scene without any real theme. A western frontier motif does play through the scenes in Serenity (the ship), but it's nothing like the show or the theme song.For fanatics, this is a must have; for fans, it might be a purchase with little payoff. If you like good movie scores, it's worth it, but don't get your hopes up."
2,Why not Edmondson?,"Meh. That's the best that can be said of this soundtrack. Which is disappointing, because music enhanced the action on FIREFLY so much! Greg Edmondson's innovative scoring in the show was so fresh and unique, and punched up the drama in wondrous ways. In fact, I can't think of a single other drama in recent years that used music as effectively as FIREFLY. Why was Edmondson not brought on board to score the movie? There's nothing particularly wrong with Newman's score... but that's the best I can say about it. It's just kind of there. Meh. There were a lot of bold choices made in bringing FIREFLY to the big screen... it's a shame somebody wimped out on the music. If you want the real music of the SERENITY universe, wait until next month and buy the FIREFLY soundtrack (which, btw, should have been released long before now)."
2,Lacks much,"The music in Serenity was lovely, well fitted to the action. However, some of the loveliest music in the film played over the end credits, included a version of the original Firefly theme. Very little of this appears on the soundtrack; unfortunately, it was the reason I purchased the cd."
4,Shiny!,If you are a fan of the show you will appreciate the diversity of the instruments used. The music propels you to the exact moment in the film. It's good to relive the experience. The only thing that would make it better is if it had included the Hero of Canton!
2,Relatively Poor,"Compared to the Firefly series soundtrack, released (online download only) by Fox, the Serenity soundtrack is poor.The Serenity soundtrack is fine in the movie as it reflects the tension and highlights the action. But as a soundtrack to listen to it's terrible. It sounds like it's from a grade B horror movie. This isn't music, it's orchestral noise."
2,Disappointed,"Im a huge fan of the TV series and the film. When I bought the TV soundtrack, my only disappointment was that the tracks were too short. I was hoping the movie soundtrack would provide more of the same, only longer.The beauty of the TV music was its mixture of eastern and western musical influences, perfectly in sync with the cultural mixture in the series. The movie soundtrack has none of that. It's modern through discordant melodies, not through new combinations of music. And it doesn't have any of the eastern, western flavors. Its standard movie music. I like Newman in general, and have other soundtracks from him. But this time I think he missed the mark both musically, and in capturing (or not) the tone of Firefly."
4,"Well, *I* liked it quite a bit...","Several of the scores on here are skippable...perhaps they grow on you, I've only listened to it once. But a lot of them are great. There's some songs arranged in a way differant than they were in the movie; some songs are longer (including the song from Serenity's introduction - albeit, just slightly). In all, it's a cool soundtrack, an I enjoy it."
2,Lackluster Soundtrack,"David Newman's score to Joss Whedon's Serenity does not capture the mood or feel of the movie as Greg Edmondson's did for the television series Firefly. The show has a heavy western theme and the TV score reflected that mood, while the movie score briefly touches on it with a guitar here and a banjo there. Mr. Newman clearly did not inherit his scoring ability from his cousin, the great Randy Newman who is one of the best in the business. The music isn't terrible, it just doesn't capture the mood and spirit of the film."
3,Serenity,"Serenity Please note : I received it a timely manner and in good shape . Good job, I do recommend this site."
4,ignore bad reviews,I've read many bad reviews on this CD. Did they not listen to the soundtrack when they watched the movie?
3,Somewhat of a disappointment,"I agree with other reviewers that this simply did not capture the mood or intensity of the film. I love the movie and saw it in theaters twice and bought the DVD as soon as it came out. I was most disappointed with Track 3 ""Serenity"". This was a pretty dramatic scene and I loved the music in the movie when the Serenity is first shown as it enters the atmosphere of a planet. Unfortunately, at only 51 seconds long, Track 3 merely gets you started with that feeling and then dumps you. Surely the composer could have adapted that music for the soundtrack rather than just dumping the listener wanting more."
3,Only OK,"Sadly, this soundtrack does not live up to the great film it's supposed to underlay. When I purchase a soundtrack I want the SOUNDTRACK! What we have here is short choppy bits of music, which is really inexcusable; while only a short blurb may be ""heard"" on film, the soundtrack is supposed encompass the entire piece as composed, that's why most folks *buy* the music. Where is the entire End Titles piece? The track we get is 1:37, come on, folks the end titles did not pass in less than 2 minutes. Is this the reason none of the tracks are available for preview? So potential buyers don't realize what they aren't getting until they've handed over the cash?The film is wonderful and I recommend it highly, this soundtrack however is disappointing."
2,Movie music cues: not good as an album,"The musical themes in this soundtrack are really good, but are not given time to develop. There are a couple times in the movie when the music is really beautiful (especially the ""Funeral / Rebuilding Serenity"" track). The problem with this soundtrack is that those one or two minute cues from the movie are all you get. I would like to hear a several minute long version of ""Rebuilding Serenity"" that has time to breathe. The bulk of the soundtrack is atmospheric or action sequence cues which aren't really enjoyable on their own. (Great movie though!)"
1,I'm from the gov't and I'm here to take your money...,"This book is the synopsis of a Canadian gov't study. 'nuf said?The author is on the stump for gov't controls, railing against everything from cigarettes to global warming. If you're at all concerned about cancer you will find:a) nothing new in this bookb) nothing of value in this bookc) your high-school freshman daughter could have done better."
5,It isn't Christmas without the Clancy Brothers Christmas!,"The threads of this music are woven so deep within me it is hard to remember when they weren't there. This album was an important part of my childhood Christmas, and I have my Dad's copy of the album and a very old cassette tape that has somehow whethered the years. When I worked as a Flight Attendant, one Christmas morning I played the tape for my passengers-they loved it. And each year I don't allow myself to listen to it until my birthday on Dec. 14th, as my family brings in the Christmas tree. The ""Clancy Brothers Christmas"" is very special indeed."
3,Over Produced,"While Teo Macero was a great producer for Columbia on jazz titles, he had no ear for how to handle the Clancy Brothers. He produced many of their latter-period Columbia albums and they pale in comparison to their earlier work. Generally too overproduced and too effected/mannered. While any Clancy Brothers album is better than none, there are many better Clancy albums to seek out first. Also, the album's running time is pretty short at under 30 minutes--surely in this day of enhanced CDs, there were unreleased tracks which Columbia could have added to stretch out the playing time, or they could have made this a two-fer and added one of the Clancy albums which Columbia has refused to release on CD. Finally, this is the post-Tommy Makem version of the group, which means that part of their soul and spirit is missing."
5,"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK ,this book is not perverted, its great!","this is a wounder full book! I have read 4 of them myself,they are verry scientific and if you are a young female you can relate i dont know what other people think but i think it is wounderfull, and if i was you i would at least try the first one!!!!!!"
5,Great for the money,For 100 bucks this thing is great. It has 3 distortion channels and 3 clean channels and mic channel which i never use because im not sure what its for. It also has 6 effects. I like using the cube mostly for clean as the distortions are kind of harsh to my ears. When i first heard this amp 2 years ago i was blown away with the delay and distortion effects...Today i dont prefer them as much..I mostly like the cleans..Sometimes with a little reverb. The effects are decent but arent the best. But i still rate it a 5 for the overall score because you dont get this many effects and sounds for 100 bucks. its a bargain and blows away any standard solid state amp
3,Have a Good Time...All the Time,"I like to sit on my couch and play guitar with this amp tilted against the wall, aimed straight at my face. From reverby integrity-rock to developmentally challenged death-chug, this amp can do it all. If you're stuck in that lonely valley between either playing through that loud tube amp you bought and gigged like twice, or playing through rock-stifling headphones, the Cube will put a smile on your face. And when you're finally ready to let the public at-large know you've mastered ""Sharp-Dressed Man,"" it runs on AA batteries, so you can set up shop at the farmer's market and let these fools know you got the blues something terrible."
3,it's fine for the price,"I was looking for a battery-operated powered amp, small enough to pack up easily, for spoken-word performance at small outdoor venues. This fits the bill. It's easy to set up and use. While I'd like a better-quality sound, it's fine for the price. It will be my backup system."
2,No new insight - don't waste your time (or money),"I actually bought this from a record store on a day when I was in a Nirvana mood and wanted to learn a little more about the band and maybe see some live footage. Upon watching this, I don't know anything that I didn't already know before. It seems the makers just interviewed random people from Kurt Cobain's hometown of Aberdeen, WA, and other third-rate rock journalists, and they have to say is that ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" was of great cultural import. Big deal. There were a few short clips of interviews with the band, but the whole documentary is very ""outside-looking-in"" and seems pretty shallow.Now I know better than to pick a random music DVD from a store without first doing my research."
3,"Buy ""Great Expectations"" instead","If you like Tasmin Archer, buy ""Great Expectations"" instead. It has Sleeping Satellite on it as well along with other grest songs."
5,a very stable molecule.....,".....i really like this cd a lot. it combines very heavy free jazz with the universal indie rock sound of chicago. although i could pretty much guess what this sounded like before i heard it, i'm very excited about the outcome. it's very laid back and soothing while at the same time exciting and new. i love the usage of the bass in these songs. some even have really kickin' beats(always a plus for me). this music sounds like what a lot of dj's try to portray when they spin, but you get it here in a live band. check out the songs, ""kryptonite smokes the red line"" for it's mellow drones and cool vibes. ""la jetee"" for it's smooth beats and nice groove. ""phonometrics"" for the funk. all in all a very solid album. give it a try, you won't be let down....."
5,I feel much better,"This product is excellent. Before i used the BIOflex magnets i had trouble with soreness and chronic pain, but with the use of this elbow support and the shoe insole orthotics i have found amazing relief and great results. The price is worth the money since it now makes my daily life much more pleasant and free of pain, and the products do not wear out like some medication or one time use items."
5,Excellent Used Condition; Fast Ship!,"Book was in good shape for its age; price was VERY appealing; book was shipped quickly and received timely. Thanks for a great service of offering used books at such a reasonable price. After reading, I am actually donating it to my local library system to complete their collection of Robert B Parker's novels."
5,Still a good Spenser read.,"I am used to the later Spenser novels, but it is interesting to read this earlier version. It was also interesting to find Spenser's age. Supposedly his first name was in this novel, but I was unsure of it, although I did find the possibility of his first name mentioned. All in all, it is a good read by a younger novelist."
4,Early Spenser....Quick and Fun Read,"I gave the first book in the series three stars, though it is more accurately 3.5. This one is a little bit better. For a first time reader of the Spenser series, one can see his character developing and showing he is three dimensional. Quirk is again in this book, as is Healy and along comes Susan Silverman as a recurring character.The plot overall is fine, but it won't knock your socks off. The writing is great and Spenser is, quite simply, a sarcastic and funny tough guy, who has plenty of interests beyond being a private investigator.I've read some of the later books in the series and wanted to start from the beginning. This one is very good, but as Spenser grows in subsequent stories, and we see similar growth with the recurring characters, the series just gets better."
5,One of Parker's Best!,"I have read Robert B. Parker since I was 13 and devour his Spenser books instantly, as he is one of only three authors that I will buy in hardback (Grafton and Evanovich are the other two). So I feel qualified in stating that this is one of his best stories in the series.Spenser is hired by the Bartlett's to find their missing son. Mom and Dad are far from perfect - Mom's a self-centered alcoholic, Dad's a passive workaholic. Kevin, the son, appears to have been kidnapped (I'll leave the plot surprises for you to discover!), and it's up to Spenser to save him.This is truly Parker at his best. The plot is terrific and never becomes secondary to Spenser's emotional life, as sometimes happens. This also happens to be the book that introduces the erstwhile Susan Silverman, which adds a nice kick to the story. The fact that this story takes place in the mid to late 70's in no way detracts from its value.Buy this book and treasure it!"
4,"Good, not great","Parker is starting to find his own style in this one, not just emulating his heros Chandler and Hemingway. And it's a good read. It's also the first in a long line of simplistic 'the kid is messed up and the parents are to blame' storylines. It's as if Parker went to a couple of counseling sessions with a Freudian psychologist and decided he understood everybody's motivation, and that gets more irritating over the years rather than less - particularly if you, like me, are the parent of a troubled teen. Life just isn't that simple. Also, if you read the whole series, you can watch Spenser move away from his prejudices against gay people, but if you haven't read the later books, this one might offend you."
2,Not a Good One,"I love the Spenser books. In fact, I think that usually they are so good that they should come with some sort of warning about readers may become addicted as did I to Parker's ace detective. That said, this book is the worst one I've read. The plot is weak at best and the resolution is not particularly good either. I am also one of those reders who thinks as great as Parker was as an author, he stumbled in his decision to put so much Susan into the books. She is introduced in this book. So, that in and of itself should put this one way down the list. Try another Spenser book first."
3,drip pan,"not pleased, stained and wouldn't come out.I thought stainless was supposed to clean up easy."
5,Humor of olden still golden,"I just love this stuff. For every time our parents claim how properly they were brought up, there is a cartoon in this book that reminds me that they were every bit as bawdy as we are today. They just had better taste about it. This book starts with a history that isn't all that much to read and then single panel cartoons each page. The art is what it is and the jokes are the ones we've been retelling for years so it must be good stuff."
4,Knockout babes from the quintessential Betty and Veronica artist,"Dan DeCarlo is considered by many comics fans to be the quintessential Archie artist -- and considered by all comics fans to be the best delineator of Archie's rival girlfriends, Betty and Veronica. DeCarlo, who died in 2001, also had a prolific career as a pin-up artist for humor magazines, and this little tome collects some of his best work from the late 50s and early 60s. DeCarlo had a knack for making his women appear funny and sexy at the same time. While most of the gags aren't much, the girls are simply TOO much. There's some (relatively tasteful) nudity here, but most gags involve skimpy clothing and lingerie, so I'd rate this between a PG-13 and a ""soft"" R."
4,and she fell in love with her husband,"Living on a farm in the 1800's is hard. When James Holcroft loses his wife to illness, he tries to maintain his farm and home by himself. It quickly becomes clear that he needs help. After James hires a series of housekeepers with miserable results, he decides to give up and sell his farm; but a old friend convinces James to try one more time. This time James offers a marriage of convenience to Alida, a young lady who has had her own set of troubles. It is heartwarming to read about two people who unselfishly try hard to help each other.Be prepared - although this is not a long book, it is not a quick read. As was common of books written over a 100 years ago, there are very long chapters without conversation and lots of inner thoughts and reflections by James, but I promise it will be worth your time to read this wonderful story.posted by Poor Richard's wyfe"
5,"Bowdrie, he's my Hero","What can you say, Bowdrie is the real Texas Ranger. I just wish Louis L'Amour had written more Bowdrie stories. I think I have all dramatizations of Bowdrie. I have all three ""The Collected Bowdrie Dramatizations"": Volume 1,2,3 and ""Strawhouse Trail"". If I missed any new stories, let me know, I want all Louis's Bowdrie work. ThanksJerry"
5,Louis L'Amour The Collected Bowdrie Vol. 1,"This was purchased for my grandfather as a gift. L'Amour is his favorite writer. He has just about every one of his books. His sight is not so good now, so these books on cd have been wonderful. He can still enjoy his westerns."
4,Bowdrie Dramatizations Vol 1,Very good. Each story had a great life of it's own. Can't wait to get into vol 2.Dave
4,The death knell of spaghetti code,"This book was produced after spaghetti code programming was well underway not only with basic but also languages that you would never think rubies in spaghetti code such as COBOL. However people programming in BASIC were notorious for creating spaghetti code as the language was a lot closer to FORTRAN and with the addition of ""peek"" and ""poke"" you could do some assembly.This book was produced long before the concept of object oriented programming. So it was revolutionary in its time. One entry point one exit point and the logic that the next programmer could follow.I keep this book on my shelf to remind me of days gone by. Another good book from that era of the trash 80 is ""Micro Computer Games."""
4,Now obsolete but very helpful in its' time,"My first computer was a TRS-80 Model 1, but the college where I taught at the time had IBM computers in the lab. Therefore, the majority of the programming I did early in my programming career was on the IBM machines and Basic was the language. Like so many others at that time I was largely self-taught and this is one of the books that I used to achieve that goal. It was written for courses in the area of introduction to computers with a programming component to be written in Basic on an IBM microcomputer. Therefore, while I used other books to learn more advanced topics of programming, this was the one that I used to familiarize myself with programming the IBM.Although its' time has long past, this book served me well when it was needed so while it is now obsolete, it was good and extremely helpful in the glorious days of the computing dinosaurs."
4,living end live up to name,"this aussie band's first ""album"" proves to be quite reminiscent of the Stray Cats, yet have their own distinct sound. Buy the ep. If you like a green day/goldfinger mix, you will like this album."
4,A life saver,"I've had this swing for a month; my 1 month old practically lives in it! It's the only thing that will calm him down when he's in full blown crying mode. He falls asleep in it, and has fun looking at the bird and other toys hanging from the bar. My only complaint would be the bird doesn't really seem to ""fly"" or flutter. I see the wings move a bit when the swing is in motion, but it's barely noticeable - my baby doesn't know the difference and still loves the swing."
2,We returned this swing!,"We hunted every toy store for this swing and were thrilled to find it at Toys R Us until we assembled it and discovered that the swing is rather unsafe. Our 5 mo. old pulled the tray off! Thank goodness we used the seat belt! Also, the birdie doesn't start flying unless you have the swing on a higher speed. :( Otherwise, the bird is totally motionless. We were very disappointed with this swing. We got a Graco swing with a safer tray that swings up to take baby out and doesn't fly off. Baby doesn't miss the birdie."
4,Works even with newborns,"I have another swing, but this one is more newborn friendly so I use this one instead. Its stable and my daughter likes it a lot. The only thing about it that I dont like its that it swings too hard for a newborn, even at level 1 (it has 6 levels). I also dislike the huge plastic bird, but overall I like it. Kinda pricey though for just a swing :P (I got it as a gift from someone that barely used it)."
5,Best Swing even for newborns,I had a different swing picked out then I saw this one and all it's bright colors and had to get it. From the first time I put my daughter in it just days from bringing her home till now shes 3 months she's loved it . All the lights and music it keeps her attention for the longest time and at night you'll find babies wont sleep in their cribs all night she sleeps atleast half the night in this lettin mommy get some zzz's . The only thing i found is you go through batteries alot but we solved that with getting some rechargable d's found at targets or radio shack
3,"Love the lights, dislike the bird","We bought this swing before I had my baby and we put her on it when she was 3 days old,but it would swing her so fast we did not use it for the longest. She is now 3 months old and doesn't really like it yet, she doesn't mind sitting in it for a little bit, but when she is on it for a while she starts to fuss. Something about the bird she does not like. She cries everytime she sees it, so we always turn his face away. She loves looking at the lights, but espcially loves watching the left bar with all of the different colors. Over all, its a pretty neat swing. I would of prefer the Aquariam Fisher Price though."
4,Good instructional video,"I learned some new techniques from this video and incorporated them without too much practice. This is a fine instructional video although it has that produced at home feel, grainy and the sound isn't great. Still, I'm enjoying it, glad I got it to add to my autoharp collection."
2,uum not sure how pure this is.......,"I loved this oil for a few weeks, but suddenly black mold has appeared in the bottom of the glass bottle I poured it into.It is possible that the bottle was not 100% clean, but it was new and never used before. I rinsed before I used it.I will try another brand next time."
2,WHAT A QUO!,"I must say I was suprised to find an actual waltz!Just the boys in the band hangin out in the drummers basement actually waltzing with eachother,did Bergmen film this?"
2,Status Quo ANNIVERSARY WALTS,I dont know why this band has not come out whith a full consert dvd.this dvd gives a good idea how good the band is.but too much lost. in short the dvd has the hits dirty water 3.27 and whatever you whant 4.11 and you only get about .30 sec. what happened?
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this CD based on the song ""The City"" which I heard on youtube. I was quite disappointed to find that most of the songs on this CD are not only highly repetetive, but contain distracting snare/drum beats that overwhelm the melodic background tones. I definitely agree with Mr. Hernandez's review that it does seem like the album has a divided essence to it, and feel like the CD would've actually been better if they removed the faster-paced drum beats that make it difficult to mellow out to the tracks."
4,"Personal and interesting voice, but feels like an album with a divided soul...","Milosh's voice can be very mellow and the topics he sings about can be inviting and fairly personal in nature. However, the majority of the songs on this album have a fairly electronic beat to them that tends to take away from the otherwise intimate feel that this album would have. It almost feels as if it is an album with a divided soul: it would have been an excellent electronic instrumental or, with a guitar, perhaps a nice folk production too. But it doesn't combine to the two in a way that feels particularly touching or groovy simultaneously. I will give it four stars because I really like his voice and his approach, but there's still more to be done here."
3,A fun module is marred by a poor kitchen set,"While I am not fond of the paltry storage space and poor construction of the Magic Cook kitchen, our 21 month-old has fun adding spaghetti and meatballs to a pasta pot and then placing it on the stove in his Magic Cook kitchen to hear it say ""spaghetti...and...meatballs....yum!"" I don't know if it is a coincidence, but he has been eating his spaghetti and other pasta products more readily after he got this module for Christmas."
1,Sad,"I loved the original JA, but couldn't get it to run on XP so I bought this. The game has been made so much more difficult that it is really not the least bit of fun. Start the game, and seconds after dropping from the helicopter you're hit several times with critical hits from sniper fire... walk 2 squares towards the SAM base and you're swarmed by a mob of 12 expert snipers... you get the idea. Not the least bit fun."
4,Well Done,"As a Trainer I am wonderfully surprised that a book of this magnitude has not made its way into every trainer's hands. It was an easy read full of useful information which transferred into knowledge. It is my hope that all who is in the field of training or teaching read this book. It has solved a problem I have had for a few years now, how to transfer learning into behaviour. The 4 Levels makes practical sense, I now make better points in my lesson plans. I am seeing benefits already and it has only been two weeks since reading the book. Well done!"
2,Transferring Learning to Behaviour,"I need to register my disappointment with the quality of the last book (Transferring Learning to Behaviour) that I ordered, which I received yesterday.The large font used (Verdana 16 pt) is totally unappealing, making some of the paragraphs too large and intimidating, and therefore totally uninspiring.The use of graphics/pictures is next to none existent, again making the book dull and unstimulating . I have yet to come across tabulated information in the book, which often makes for easier comparison of issues.In short, I am deeply disappointed, more so since I have bought books of a much better quality from Amazon before... Please let this not happen again!"
3,really fun gift,"these glasses are great. i have noticed an increase in interest from both males and females in the love department. the wipers seem to hypnotize people and i think they want to sleep with me. sometimes i do it. they also prevent bodily fluids from entering my eye cavity, thus allowing me to thrust my love about and still feel protected. if you have any questions regarding the care or use of these one of a kind shades, feel free to call me @ 305-345-0784. i can be reached any time. enjoy!!"
2,there are better options,I think you might be better off with another option...this book has a bunch of typos and other mistakes. I didn't think it was worth the money. I passed the exam but switched to another book after 4 chapters.
3,"Does the job, not great","This food chopper would be good if it works as it is supposed to do. Without any food in it, the chopper will turn 1/8 rotation at evey chop as featured. But once any food is placed, it becomes difficult to push it down, as the blades are not very sharp. Moreover, it does not turn most of the times. I had to carefully half press it sometimes, in order to make it turn. Hence, if I am not careful, the food (I use it to mince garlic most of the times) remains as very big pieces, as the blades have cut it in only one or two places.The other design issue I have with this is that it is a huge problem to clean it. The blades do not come out, and I had to push the blade with my hand to keep it extended in order to clean it under jet of water. I don't think the blades will clean at all in a dishwasher. As a result, it is not very clean after six months of use and it smells heavily of garlic, the only thing I use it to cut, and hence I could not use it to chop any other food."
1,Just another gizmo that don't work,Don't waste your $10.00 on this chopper....it has too many parts and does not rotate properly...over designed and to much plastic..yuckey...maybe I can use parts of out in the shop...
1,Don't Buy,"Only worked the first 2 times I used it. After that, the blade stopped turning after I pushed it down. So the food wasn't evenly chopped."
1,Does not work,"The chopper worked well for the first week, then the blade stop revolving. I contacted the manufacturer and they told me how to fix it. It worked but only for a day. I contacted the manufacturer again and have not heard from them. Do not buy this item. If you want a really good chopper that is easy to clean unlike this one get a Pampered Chef, available online. It's a little more money but worth it."
2,"Show is good, but WAY too expensive.",The show itself is very good and gets 4 stars. But seriously? almost $60 for only 13 episodes is absolutely ridiculous. No wonder internet piracy is so rampant.
1,Did Rick really aprove this CD?,"I have loved Rick Wakeman's work for years. But I was very disappointed in the record company for releasing this collection of previously released material and playing it off as new.The music is very nice and soothing and wonderful to relax to... oh and did I mention it's OLD?I would not be surprised if this CD did not have the OK from Rick Wakeman. After all, it wouldn't be the first time the record company ripped him off.Good music, bad trick. Do your research. Buy the official releases that have these tracks. Not this one.Shame on you, BMG."
1,"Good picture art, poor talent.",This music does not deserve to be considered even inspired by Lord of the Rings. The Argonath waving with their hands look interesting and the price is not expensive but at the end you wonder why did I purchase this music at all? The seller obviously tried to get advantage and fame from LOTR.
5,Comfort for families of gays with regard to the church,My brother was gay and I have no doubt he went to Heaven when he died. Yet others have told me being gay was his sin. Somehow I didn't view him as any more a sinner than other humans. I learned that God does not create mistakes. More and more we know that homosexuality is not a choice but inborn. No one would choose be to gay with all the negatives it brings into their lives. This book brings comfort to me and I recommend it for anyone who is concerned about their gay friend or family member and how they fit into our churches. It further explains how the bible fits into this process. Well worth reading.
5,"An antidote to ""textual abuse""","Jack Rogers takes a fresh look at what the Bible says and doesn't say about homosexual people and relationships, in this very readable and greatly needed book. With the clarity born of a lifetime of teaching and the passion born of a lifetime of bible study, he lays out the principles of Reformed biblical interpretation and then takes on each of the famous verses most often used to demean and exclude.As a happily married, Bible-believing church member, I am deeply saddened when people misuse the Bible to drive people away from the church. And I'm very tired of hearing the erroneous claims that the Bible ""clearly condemns"" anything other than mom-pop-two-kids-&-a-dog families. The clearly presented scholarship in this book could open conversations with many people who take the Bible seriously and want to know how they can accept their gay relatives or neighbors. I'll be giving a copy to my church library and to several friends."
1,"Out of Context, Scripture can Mean Anything","I bought this book to help me understand the liberal position of homosexuality within the church. It seems to me that the author takes some novel interpretations of scripture to support his political position. While the author makes a compelling modern-culture based argument for tolerance, and even full acceptance of practicing homosexuals into all positions in laity and ordained church leadership, he failed to make a compelling, Bible-based argument to support his case.I think you'll be disappointed if you look to this book to equip yourself to support the liberal viewpoints -- the arguments just aren't that good."
5,"Yes, Jesus loves me! Was there any doubt?","This is the best book I have ever read on the subject of the Bible and Homosexuality. It is the most in-depth and inspiring book. I highly recommend it to anyone on their spiritual journey, either gay or straight. If you know someone who is questioning themselves, or need to have their minds and hearts opened, this is the book to read."
5,"Energy, Intelligence, Imagination and Love...","Thank heavens for Rogers' articulate, intelligent and compellingly Gospel-driven contribution to the discussion of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people of faith in the life of the church! Professor Rogers takes into careful consideration his own social context and moves beyond -- a rare thing -- reminding the church that we are risking our own souls should we delay the careful consideration of the Gospel message of grace. As a member of the Christian GLBT community of faith, I gladly recommend this book to those struggling to accept the fact that God loves us all."
1,Deceived,I thought I read the description but at the VERY END itsaid to send the results to your physician. BOOHOO!I missed it and am angry and will put this company on my warning list!
1,Still waiting,The product I haven't tried yet...I'm still waiting for American Wholesale to send me the second test (that I exchanged). It's about two weeks overdue.
2,The book fo the Bulldog,I thought the book had some interesting things about the bulldog but I thought it was just to outdated. The pictures were nice but mostly in black in white. To be honest when I received the book I was disappointed.
3,History Book,This is a good book if you are looking for the history of the bulldog. It also has alot of information on different lines and breedings of champion show dogs. There are chapters dealing with bulldogs in different countries as well as their champions form Mexico to Russia.I was looking for a pet owners book and this book left me wanting for more especially with health issues. The book was written in 1985 so it is slightly outdated. However one bulldog website said it was a must for any serious bulldog owner. I have mine and hope to use it someday.
4,GREAT for Learning the Basics To Gaited Horses,"Good solid book on the basics of training and selection of the gaited horse by Brenda Imus.It gets a bit weary in spots if you are an experienced horseman, but it is a great book to review from time to time."
2,Short (what is good) but having tens of errors.,Lots of errors and all kinds of typos.Some topics are missed.Only good if you already know the material soyou will enjoy finding errors and misleading facts.I am wondering if author ever read his own book.
2,Book needs some work,"If only this book had authors that were as good with networking as I am with world economic planning, it would be valuable.--Alan Greenspan"
2,Disappointing,"I read this to my children after reading Paddle to the Sea, which is by far one of my favorite children's books. Minn of the Mississippi is older than Paddle to the Sea, and is VERY difficult to read. It is quite abstract, and there were many parts that I couldn't understand because the English is rough, perhaps intended to be poetic. If you have not read Paddle to the Sea, please do. It is far superior."
4,We love turtles,"An excellent read-aloud book about a snapping turtle, Minn's adventures down the Mississippi River can add more turtle information and U.S. geography to your studies."
3,Not written well,"I think the story of Father Stanley Francis Rother is a compelling one, but Henry Nouwen does not do it justice. I have heard good things about Nouwen's other writings, but this story is poorly researched. I learned more in the Epilogue than I did the rest of the book, and it left me wondering why Nouwen failed to investigate certain aspects of Father Stan's life. Rather than an honest, detailed look into his life, Nouwen paints a one dimensional character and chooses to ignore the human aspects of Father Stan's life. It had a cheesy Catholic feel to it, as if Henry was just writing propaganda to promote Father Stan to the sainthood.I am glad I read the book, as it exposed me the life of a martyr, and I don't know another book that tells the story of Father Stan. But for a more general investigative book on some of the history of Guatemala's long war, I would recommend Silence On The Mountain by Daniel Wilkinson."
3,why do all cassettes arrive in cracked cases,I bought this as a gift for someone whose favorite Christmas carol is John Davidson's Silver Bells....but I had to go find a replacement case to give it to her. She enjoyed it
1,Lacks Credibility...,"Where the recovery-from-12-steps movement has legitimate issues regarding 12 step recovery and the treatment center industry that should be addressed, Rebecca adds excessive melodrama and relies on her contributors ignorance of what 12 step recovery actually is to prove her point, therefore diluting the message of the recovery-from-12-steps movement. Knowing the truth about the pros and cons of 12 step recovery before reading this book I had a feeling that this was a parody of the recovery-from-12-steps movement instead of a serious book."
1,What amazes me...,Is how many people reviewed this book without reading it or going to an AA meeting to see for themselves. You know a LOT of people write about being visited by Aliens...does that make them real for you? And a LOT of people think going to a Doctor is wrong. Do you still go to one? You dont have to really know anything to write a book. You just need to know how to get someone all riled up. Contempt prior to investigation makes for a very tiny world indeed. What do you expect from a room full of drunks trying to help each other out? What do you expect from a down and out person that can't get sober and wants to blame it on someone else? The only people I know of that dont get sober are the people that dont quit drinking. You dont need a book to figure that out.
4,Excellent Resource but notice the publish date,"As other reviews have commented, this book has a wealth of information on robotic systems and explained in a way that makes it very available to a beginner but with enough detail for the expert.However, note that the book was published in 1987. There were not any microcontrollers for the hobbiest at the time (the computers quoted in the book are Apple IIe and IBM-PC clones).If you want a good description of sensors and output systems, then this book is excellent, if you want information about programable brains of robots, this book will not satisfy you."
4,Good book. But need another to fill in some weak areas,"Good book over all. This book covered the basics well, from basic hardware frame to senors. The book is written in a modular way. The author does this to provide a mix and match ability of different components. I have tried any of the circuits yet. The robots the author walks you through in the book involve considerable hardware construction and metal parts. Lots of drilling, taping, screwing, bushings, chains, etc. A few pages of the book seemed to be disorganized and vage to me. Also, I was disappointed that the only coverage of a microprocessor and programming, was to use a notebook on the robot, and did not cover any onboard central processing. I will be purchasing ""Mobile Robots: Inspiration to implementation"" written by a couple of people at MIT to fill in the gaps. I would have ordered the later book if I had to choose again."
4,Good book.,This book covers the hardware half of robotics very well. It is woefully lacking when it comes to programming the robots from a PC though. All the examples are very vague and in BASIC. It was otherwise a very good book. Excellent idea source.
5,Perfect book for all robot experimenters,"This books aproach helps you see what you need,and what you are going to finish up with. It slightly out of date, but this really isnt a problem, a transister is still a transister. I highly reccomend this book for all ages."
5,Excellent book for beginners,"This is an excellent book for beginners. It illustrates how to build robots starting from a basic frame, to locomotation, and to sensing. The author describes the multiple ways to make a robot, out of wood or plastic or metal, and provides the pros and cons out of his own experiences. This helps the reader avoid many common mistakes.He also instructs you in what parts to acquire, their ballpark costs, and where you can get them.He delves into basic electronics if you're not familiar with it.He does the same for basic mechanical parts.Overall, reading this book is wonderful because it is like going through a robotic apprenticeship."
5,Excellent book on building/interfacing hobby robots,"Excellent book covering many aspects of beginning robot design, including locating parts, motors and locomotion, sensors, power supplies, and computer interfacing. A must-buy for those startingout in robotic design as a hobby. Very easy to read and understand"
2,"A good introduction, but full of errors.","A good introduction to devices useful to the robotics hobbyist,has many novels approaches that will stimulate your thinking about robots. The primary criticism is that many (most ?) of the circuits presented have serious errors in them. Unless you are competent to 'debug' a faulty circuit, stay away from the electronics projects presented."
5,Now You See It...Now You Don't,"At first I thought I received an empty tube in the mail. This item is of such a small diameter it was hard to see! Frankly, I had no appreciation for just how fine a diameter .0065"" was since when I set up my dial caliper at 0.0065"" it was hard to see any light between the jaws. The 0.0055"" wire was no better! One thing, though, this wire is so fine and so long (5') that getting it out of the clear carrier tube was an adventure. Getting it back in was impossible. I tried zapping it with a ZeroStat(TM) to try to negate the magnetism of the tube. I tried feeding it in an inch at a time. Nothing worked. I eventually had to cut it up in smaller pieces and store it that way. I use this item to make antennas, guide wires, switches, and drawing pen filaments. It is steel so if you should drop it on the floor have a small magnet handy to pick it up."
4,"Fakes, Scams and Goofy Characters","Lovejoy appears on a television show as an expert on antiques. As a result, he is offerred a job by Ben Cox, director of a Suffolk archaeology trust who is worried about the county being robbed of its treasures, especially ancient bronzes buried in the ground. After Cox and local collector George Prentiss are both murdered, Lovejoy sets out to find the killer and solve the mystery of the missing buried treasures. There are two big entertainments in a Lovejoy novel. The reader learns a lot about antiques, with an emphasis on the fakes and scams, and also meets some great characters. The downside of all this is that the plot tends to get buried beneath the goofy characters and their many antics."
1,WASTE OF INK,"A true waste of time , money and ink. An endless parade of characters in a mindless tale of futility.The only real mystery here is how can the television version of Lovejoy be so good when the print version is so bad.In this sad attempt at clever writting Lovejoy is a worthless coward with no redeeming qualities what so ever.Also our ""hero"" seems to be blindly stupid as he is either getting beat up or being forced into jobs , favors and contracts constantly.If you enjoy televisions Lovejoy ,or just a good book , don`t bother with this rubbish."
4,A quality cheapie,"Al Stewart's ""Time Passages Live"" is one of those discs you see and think, ""What the [heck] is this?"" A [...]live disc that says on the cover, ""Year of the Cat. Time Passages. On the Border. And More!""; no liner notes at all; and, incredibly, a misspelling of ""Time"" on the spine. Ignore all that. This truly is a fine live disc from Stewart's most productive period. The nine-song concert disc recorded in Chicago in 1978 has good sound and a couple unlikely live nuggets to go with the expected hits. Most of the songs are as good or better than their album versions. Certainly ""Sirens of Titan"", ""Life in Dark Water"" and ""Song on the Radio"" are punchier and better. What a treat to have live versions of those first two. There's a nice two-minute plus piano intro to a strong version of ""Year of the Cat"" followed by, of all things, the ""Pink Panther"" theme, a sax solo that morphs into an all-band rocker. ""Time Passages Live"" is [...], yes, but very worthwhile."
4,A great live album from Al's popularity peak,"The rare Blue Album had 8 of these 9 cuts. A great version of Sirens of Titan was added. This is a well-recorded, budget-priced release. It has no printed info except for the song titles. Several of these cuts were available on the UK Russians and Americans CD, which is now OP. The remastered YOTC, which is great, has this version of On The Border as one of the bonus cuts."
2,Time passed this,"2 1/2A perfectly mediocre live capsule from this minor folk-proggie does capture a few instrumental moments of passion (the second half of Year of the Cat and some creative liberties with the following Pink Panther theme finally breathe much needed life into the disc), but the majority of singer-songwriter-slush feels autopiloted-bland at best, worse off for that pretentious late 70's British sort of lyrical and vocal delivery. I would say that if you enjoy newer Steely Dan, then rock out with this."
4,How to Build a Traditional Ford Hot Rod,"I found this book to contain a lot of information on how to build hot rods as I built them in the 50's & 60's. The book could go into more depthin the area of using what parts were available in those days. I was happy to see information that goes back to old school and away from the fiberglass, mustang front ends etc. that anyone can build from kits etc. I wish there were more old school information that we were able to get from the Hot Rod magazines of the 50's/60's. Perhaps someone could re-publish the articles from the old mags so could build a true 50's/60's Ford hot Rod. This book is as close as I have found to what little information still exists."
3,Build a Traditional Ford Hot Rod,"Overall, I like the book but I have two complaints:1) The book glosses over some of the most technical items. Information on adapting steering and rear suspension are minimal. More pictures and diagrams for these would have helped.2) The editing or print job is terrible, at least in my copy. Pictures are missing or misplaced, irrelevant to the chapter, or have been chopped in half. I wish I had a few pictures referenced but not found.3) 10.25.12 - Had to add a third comment, which is the publisher, Motorbook was completely unresponsive to phone calls and e-mails."
5,The Secluded 185 Page Wonder,"I became addicted to the book from the first page. The suspense, drama, and endless mystery of the book kept me reading page after page, unable to put it down ... A great book for thinkers, I would recommend this to all lovers of reading."
1,Latin Instruction,"This book seems to be as complete as one might expect from the price. However, it would be considerably more effect and useful if it came with a CD to help the studnt lean the sounds of the letters and words."
3,Good service,I ordered the book (Latin Grammar) and received it (in Holland) a few weekslater in very good shape. I like the service.
2,Missing parts...,"I bought this a while ago for my 1992, 4 door automatic Geo Metro, I rebuilt the engine top to bottom and as I got ready put my newly built engine in, I first had to replace my rear engine mount. Just when I though I was done, I found that the pucks on the sides of the mount were missing! So I took 1 puck from my front engine mount, so now I have one puck on my front and one on my rear. Even though I was missing the pucks...I did not see a difference in my engine movement:)"
3,A little boring,"It was more of a doc than a hunters movie. It was a little slow, but did learn a bunch of new stuff about free diving and spear fishing."
5,Right Between The Eyes,"You'll either love this author and book or hate them. Dan Kennedy refreshingly hits you right between the eyes with sound business advice and reality. If you have thick skin and a sincere willingness to want to succeed in business, you won't want to miss this read."
2,"An ironic title, perhaps?","What do you want to learn about business? Finance? Not here. Marketing & sales? Not here. Niche selection and competitive strategies? Not here. Believing in yourself? Tony Robbins does it better. Management techniques and strategies? Nope.What does that leave? Anecdotes about people Kennedy has worked with/for.This is the least of Kennedy's books. If reading it is in your future, use the local library. (I did, thank heavens.)"
1,Not a great book at all,"The litmus test for any book on selling is, will it help me make my numbers? Any book that doesn't do that doesn't deserve to be on the shelf in my book. Boy, was I sucked in by this one.I read this book based upon the glowing reviews it received. All I can say it that they must be friends of the author or paid reviews because this book is one of the least effective books on selling I've ever read.If you want to base your career on things like ""Create good guilt"" (wow, nothing like a little manipulation, huh?), or ""Create Differentiation"" (now, there's a brand new concept) (both of these are from page 87 which I pulled at random).Save your money. If you want to CLOSE BUSINESS then get Strategic Selling or Conceptual Selling, both classics that will help you make your numbers.Good selling,Bob"
2,A Bit Disappointing,"I saw an ad for this book in a magazine. The ad was written well enough to get me to bite. However once I bought and read the book, I felt rather disappointed. Not every chapter is written by Dan. Some parts of the book felt like advertisements themselves. It is not like I did not learn anything from this book. But if I had it to do over, I would have skipped it."
2,Put off by political bias,"Just started reading this,but very put off by the rude comments about liberal politicians, liberal media, etc. It is distracting, annoying and unnecessary."
4,Panavise Mount for Scion xB; Oregon Coast,"Excellent idea and fair to good workmanship. Section that is visible to car occupants is a perfect fit -- but area that bolts to car inside the dash is not a good fit. Mine holds on by just a few threads of the mounting screw. The pre-drilled holes in the plate that supports your cell phone or media player are sloppily placed. I'm going to contact Panavise and ask them to ship me an undrilled plate so that I can ""start with a clean slate"" for use with my iPhone."
4,Finally! A sunblock I can use around eyes w/ no irritation!,"This product is pretty amazing. I have searched for years to find a sunblock that is non-irritating to my face and especially my eyes! Obviously you shouldn't put anything on you eyelids, or within direct contact with your eyes, but you can put Solar Sense right up to the ""crow's feet"" region, browline, and even under eyes..(but not up to lashes of course.) I also put it on my neck, ears, and chest. It doesn't smell strong like other sunblock's either!It is reasonably priced, and very convienent to carry.Depending on your skin type and season (level of humidity vs dry air)you may have to wear your facial moisturizer under Solar Sense. In the dry times, I have had to wear my facial moisturizer underneath the Solar Sense.Your face actually feels soft after about 15 minutes post application, and not greasy!!Lasts all day!"
3,Great Leather,"This shoe requires a padded insole-especially if one walks short distances. The arch support is poor. For the cost, one would think that the shoe would have a decent arch support and insole.It is a comfortable shoe. Look quite good. And is comfortable to wear."

4,I Love This Album,"I bought it on vinyl back in 1964 when I was 14. Played the heck out of it until it was virtually unplayable. Glad that I finally found it on cd, but I wish Sony would have taken some time to remaster/remix for optimum sound quality. It also would have been nice if they would have used the original artwork/graphics. But, I guess for the price you can't have everything. Hopefully, they will re-release this album one day on the Legacy label with deluxe packaging."
3,It's ok...at best.,"The items that go with the intellitalk kitchen set aren't really wonderful. Yes, they make the kitchen talk, but so what? The size is appropriate for the kitchen which is one of the main reasons we bought the set, but they really just aren't great. I hate that the ""cheese"" comes off the ""crust."" I guess the point is to ""make"" the pizza, but it really just leads to my son either pretending to only eat crust or only eat cheese. We have the birthday set too. The pizza set, when compared to that set, is great. Do not buy the birthday set. Your cake will not stay together and it's not really that fun. I am hoping to just buy some nice fruits and veggies in the future and I could care less if they make the frying pan on the kitchen say ""Mmm...pizza...sizzle...sizzle (??)...that smells good... be careful...it's hot... don't forget to put away the leftovers...."""
4,Beautiful classic locket,"Very nice locket. The one I purchased does not look as smooth as the photo -- it's more ""heart-shaped"" 3-dimensionally, which I think is prettier. The bail is scalloped like in the photo; I kind of think a smooth-edged bail would be nicer. The smooth, polished finish extends to the substantial inside edge of the locket, then the interior seems to have a nice brushed-like finish. The edge inside should hold photos well. The hinge is visible, but it seems a little less obvious than the one in the photo. It appears to be fairly durable, but only time and use will tell. I am giving this as a gift, so ultimately I won't know. It's a pretty locket, and I would consider buying this again as a gift or for myself."
5,quality body oil,"I was looking for a small amount of massage oil that would be ideal to have while traveling with the wife overseas. Small and compact, I consider this oil to be of high quality. The viscosity was ideal for massage - not greasy at all. It had a nice fragrance, not really energizing, but who believes in such emotional words anyway - do ya?The bottle that the oil came in is durable and the cap was(is) sturdy and doesn't leak. After stuffing this into my luggage several times and hauling it around the world it still is completely leak proof. Of course, I still took precautions by placing the bottle in a small zip-freezer bag.This oil has played a special role in one of the many beautiful loving memories of our overseas honeymoon. A memorable purchase to say the least."
2,Not the best version,"This wasn't the best version of Jane Eyre I've ever seen. If I didn't already know the story line, I would have been hard pressed to keep up with what was happening. The storytelling style was disjointed at best. I wish I had rented this before I put my money where my mouth was for this one."
3,not the best,"not my favorite version, but still worth a watch. The BBC's version was the best i've seen so far. I did like the woman who played Jane."
4,Deviates from original text,"Movie is well done, but it deviates from the original text. Makes for a good comparison/contrast essay for students. No way students can master an examination from exchanging the movie for the written text!"
2,Such a disappointment,"Like other reviewers, I love the Jane Eyre novel and agree with them in saying this film does not do the book justice; I expected that when i viewed the film, but was still hoping to get some enjoyment of it, however was sadly disappointed. Also alot of things are different from the real story.I anticipate for someone who does not know the story and descriptive emotions between the characters this movie will be quite confusing since it begins at the middle of the book then jump to Jane being a child and back and forth, without including much of what originally was going on in her life. The scenes between Jane and Mr. Rochester are so few and cut short that there isn't very much to see regarding the development of there love, the ending where Jane returns to the blind Mr. Rochester was also the worst, viewers will be left waiting for more but will sadly only see the credits. So disappointing...since i think it had potential to be a very good updated version."
3,disapointed,This Movie had the potential of being a Good Jane Erye Movie the one thing that I didnt like about it the most important scenes were left out which is what tells the love developing between Rochester and Jane when it is like that the story isnt told it dont make a lot of since. If you want to see the best Get the dalton and clark Stephens and wilson cant be beat!
3,"Good, but not quite right...","I had high hopes for this adaptation, and for the most part, I enjoyed it. Fassbender was fantastic, although a bit too handsome and slender in build. Rochester is meant to be althletic, broad shouldered, and harsh looking. But those are minor complaints. Overall, I thought Mr. Fassbender embodied the character very well.I thought Mia W. had the right look for Jane, but her performance was a bit boring to me. I know that Jane is meant to be plain and quiet, but I just didn't sense her inner strength, and in the first proposal scene, she seemed more annoyed than passionate.Lastly, I HATED the ending. No Ferndean? No bringing of a tray, and the touching of hands? And what was with that crazy beard that Rochester was sporting? Worst of all, they just ended it with a kiss, and then, fade to black. Couldn't they have added ten more minutes and put the second proposal in? If it wasn't for such a chopped off ending, I would have enjoyed it a lot more."
2,Don't buy,It doesn't do the book justice. There is no chemistry between the actors. Her childhood took too long. There wasn't enough time spent on the developing the relationship between Rochestor and Jane. It was way too rushed in the middle and too much time was spent on things that didn't matter. The dialog sucked. Do yourself a favor and watch the Youtube clips availbe. You will save yourself the cost of the movie. Also Rochester can't act.
5,another remake,"As far as the service to receive this item, it was great. As for another remake of Jane Eyre it was satisfactory. I think I wanted more to the ending. Of course, I just think Timothy Dalton was such a fantastic Mr Rodchester so that makes it hard to enjoy another version as much as I enjoyed that version. However, I love the story and it is still great to view other versions, just not as enjoyable."
5,Well Worth It,"The item was well enjoyed. As a gift, its use is great to add to a collection, and it was enjoyed by all present. Definitely a good buy."
3,Not my favorite version,"This is not my favorite version of the Jane Eyre story, but it is by no means bad. Mia does a great job portraying Jane, as did the young actress who played her child counterpart. My biggest problem was with Fassbender as Rochester. I usually like Fassbender, but I thought he was very bland as Rochester. He didn't evoke enough passion, even at the end. My favorite version is the 2006 BBC version with Toby Stephens, who was great as Rochester. I recommend that one, but if you're a fan of Mia or Michael, this one is fine too."
2,Too Stilted,"I wanted to like this, but it just wasn't any good for me (the great 2006 version of Janey Eyre puts this movie to shame). I was so bored watching this movie, it was rushed and not engaging at all.There is very little to no chemistry between the actors who play the leads; Their lines are delivered in a very stilted manner, it's like they're reading the words and reciting them without any emotion (the viewer doesn't see or feel any romance in this version). The ending is also very weak. They don't even show the fire in Thornfeild, but rather Mrs. Fairfax (who is the only well cast character in this movie) is the one who tells the story to Jane, and that's it (talk about a weak and anti-climatic ending).In the end, this was just a boring, weak and stilted movie... disappointing."
2,Lacking chemistry in this Jane Eyre version,"Very disappointed! The main actors are all great actors, but I found that the director did not use them accordingly. I found this movie very boring and even though I'm a huge fan of the book, I don't mind loose versions, but this one is too incomplete, missing important parts and characters of the book, so why to name the film ""Jane Eyre""?. In my opinion the main problem is the lack of chemistry between Mia and Michael. I saw this DVD three times to see if I was wrong, but still, you don't feel the chemistry of the two main characters and without that, there is not Jane Eyre. If you want a good version, with actors that make you feel like you are really leaving the story and that they care deeply about each other then buy the 2007 Masterpiece Theatre version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson. To me that is the best version."
2,Choppy - could have been better...,"I agree with other reviewers - 2 hours is insufficient. It seems like the movie is broken into 3-5 minute segments of the most important scenes in the book. It's very choppy, rushed, and doesn't really explain anything. If you watch this (and haven't read the book), you're going to wonder what the hell happened between certain scenes. I thought the cast was great, but the movie just didn't flow. If you're looking for a good adaptation, check out one of the BBC/Masterpiece Theatre productions; they never disappoint."
3,Jane eyre,I would say that after waiting on the first purchase on this movie I finally received this movie but got a little confuse of how it started. I guess because it is a new review movie.
5,Love love love it!,"I first saw this on Netflix and then became rather obsessed with it and had to order the DVD. I also read the book after seeing the movie for the first time so I can actually tell how good the adaptation is. This is just a perfect movie about love, Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender were made for this part. Jamie Bell is not really a good fit, considering how in the book he was described as being much taller and more attractive...but I digress. The cinematography is incredible, along with the set and costumes. I wish it was longer, even watching the deleted scenes makes you feel unsatisfied - but it's based on a 500 page novel so I suppose that was bound to happen. Chick lit and love movies are not my typical genre but I really enjoyed this one - highly recommend."
2,Jane Eyre,"I have to admit, I was very disappointed in this version. I love the book and have watched most of the movie versions from the last 20 years or more and was so looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it does not follow the story as accurately as the Timothy Dalton version and is so disjointed and anti-climactic that is was not really enjoyable for me. I don't think you can follow the story from this movie unless you have read the book and if you have read the book you will probably not feel that it does justice to the story."
4,Mia is Jane Eyre,"This is a very good version of the movie, although I wish it would have been longer. Mia Wasikowska is the by far the best actress I have seen in this role. She is so believable. I didn't like the abrupt ending of the movie, but it is still one of my favorite versions."
4,"Good actors and locations, etc.","I still have not read the book so I cannot comment on the adaptation aspect. The actors are superb, though, especially the two main ones as Jane and Fairfax. Judi Dench is of course excellent as always. The enormous English country houses used are stunning, to say the least.Jane leads a difficult and lonely life until she ends up a governness in a mysterious household with a dark secret upstairs. This leads to much angst and conflict between her and her employer-turned-would-be-husband. I won't spoil it any further."
1,don't waste your time,i can't even give this movie any stars but they make you give one. which is why it's a one. This movie was so bad that i had hard time getting through it. The acting was really bad. I didn't feel any connection between Rochester and Jane. Just wasn't there. I have seen better versions of this movie. Also this movie jumped around to much. When you go to the special features and see the deleted scenes that they should have keeped in the movie would have been better with them.
2,Boring,I have watched many Jane Eyres and loved them all but this one was boring. Why have her start out at the rochester mansion and recall her life as a child and at the lowwood school. It was changed to much to like it. I wish i never bought it. They should have started with her as a child moved on to the rochester house and then carried on further than any other Jane Eyre.
3,Very Disappointed,"I had such high hopes for this film, because I usually like adaptations of Jane Eyre, but it was such a disappointment! It felt as though it was 5 hours long and Mia Wasikowska was incredibly bland and un-spirited, even Michael Fassbender's handsomeness couldn't make up for that. Further, she looks as though she is 15 and he is clearly in his thirties, which didn't make for good chemistry at all! I have seen other adaptations(the best being with Toby Stephens, in my opinion), and never hoped it would finally come to an end. I think sometimes when Hollywood gets ""its"" hands on classics like this, a big budget isn't always the best idea."
1,What the HECK happened here!?,"I was all kinds of happy to see this movie for such a low price, so I ordered it when I ordered my textbooks. It arrived in a timely manner, however the BRAND NEW DVD was physically damaged! I am so annoyed with the situation that I don't even feel like contacting the seller in any way! It wouldn't be so bad, except the product was packaged properly, and should not have broken!"
4,grape job,An excellent modern interpretation. Doesn't identically follow the book quite like the BBC 2006 version does but still a wonderful piece of cinema. In my opinion Toby Stephens in the 2006 BBC version nailed the Rochester character perfectly; capturing the perfect mercurial byronic hero. Mia Wasikowska did an amazing job with the role.
3,twist on a tale twice told,"I adore Mia so expected this to be a fresh take on the oft told story. Im afraid that it just does not hold a candle to the smoldering passion of the version with Charlotte Gainsbourg. While the cinematic technique of telling the tale in flashbacks lends a freshness to it, the story was bland. There was no energy to Adele, Rochester came across snarly rather than tormented, and the conflict of poor Mrs. Fairfax was glossed over. The visuals however were stunning. On the whole, I say rent it, dont buy it. Especially since the special features were short, pathetic trailers. Very disappointing-it would have been great to see some real interviews, learn more about recreating the period, etc."
3,Not the best version but it's ok.,"I wanted to see this at the theater but I'm glad I rented it on Amazon and only spent 3.99 instead of $10. There are better movie versions of this great novel. The long version with Timothy Dalton is one of them, the 1944 version with two of the greats Orson Wells and Joan Fontaine, and my personal favorite with Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds (their acting was the most emotional-you could feel their pain). It is however much better than the worst version with William Hurt!"
1,Not Jane,Jane is supposed to be strong and we are meant to like her. The actors fail to bring the characters to life and fail to get us to even like them. I'm a huge fan for the BBC 4 hours adaptation but this one sucks.
4,Great rendition of Jane Eyre!,"I was expecting this movie to be awful based on the 3.5 star rating. My husband had a feeling I would like it regardless of the reviews and rented it. He was so right, we actually both enjoyed it. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and I feel this movie captures the heart of the book. I found the cast was great, the cinematography was lovely and the story line stayed true to the book. Of course the entire book cannot be covered in a two hour movie but the core feeling of the book and it's characters is captured beautifully. Don't let the negative reviews stop you from watching this movie, it is definitely worth a watch!"
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Given the relatively short length of the movie, I was pleased- it felt like the film maker kept the essential elements of the book. The actors were outstanding."
1,"THIS IS FOR BLURAY, NOT MOVIE","MOVIE GREAT!so far bought and returned 2 blu-ray dvds of this movie and neither of them play. if the 3rd does not play, i'll keep my regular copy. heard blu-ray problems on other brand new releases of some movies, don't know the problem. my player is only 2 years old, not hooked up to the internet."
3,Good but not great....,"I didn't feel that this film had sufficient character development. If you're looking for a film version that is true to the book, this would not be one. Overall, it's a pretty gripping story considering that Steven Spielberg was the director. The gothic elements were a unique twist compared to most film versions of the book."
1,disappointed,the service from amazon was as per usual excellent. the movie was the disappointment. I own other copies of this classic and this one was my least favorite although the Welles version come a close second. I passed it on to someone else and did not add it to my collection. sorry about that!!!
2,Not the greatest version.,"Unfortunately this version of one of my favorite tales, Jane Eyre, falls way short. It feels forced, the acting rather bland and wooden. I love Fassbender, but I just feel like he was trying rather badly to copy previous 'Rochester' performances and failing instead of owning him. Jane was mopey, none of her cleverness really showcased, and the emotional moments felt highly ingenuine. An example would be the bed-on-fire scene. Dreadful. In essence, a dvd to be passed over if you're looking to own a great Jane Eyre. Try the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson undertaking instead."
5,My Favourite Adaptation of Jane Eyre,"I was encouraged to watch the movie based on the extra clips on Focus's YouTube page; the depth of the language in the conversations between Jane & Mr. Rochester gave me hope that it will not betray Charlotte Bronte's book. It is a true adaptation of the book by all means and I actually thought the 2 hours length did not do it justice. I am praying the DVD version will have a director's cut version in it that includes all the scenes taken out to fit into the timescale for public viewing. Michael is indeed the best Mr. Rochester ever, Timothy Dalton comes next."
5,marianelli magic!!!,"Dario Marianelli's rapturous score -the best of 2011 in fact- serves as a ravishing underpinning to this most gorgeous and visually enthralling of all Jane Eyre adaptations. For me, even with THE TREE OF LIFE, OF GODS AND MEN and INCENDIES in the mix, this is the best film of 2011.Can't wait for this blu-ray release!"
2,So much potential but it left me disapointed,There was so much potential in this production but in the final analysis - disappointment.This production with its out of sequence storyline and omission of parts of the book drag it down. The 06' version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stevens was and sill is my favorite.Anyone who has not seen that production should. And of course read the book!
1,Boo.....,"I just finished reading the book last night and so I had to go pick up this dvd today. Well, I just finished watching this movie version of Jane Eyre and I did NOT enjoy it. I thought this would be like the updated Pride & Prejudice but it's not. It leaves out soo much of the story and it doesn't fully develop the characters so that you can't really connect with them. This movie would only make sense if you had read the book. The 1996 version of Jane Eyre (which you can stream on Netflix) is A LOT better. I like that this version is updated but it only scratches the surface of the book. My advice is to rent it first before purchasing."
1,lame and weak,This is the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre that I have ever seen so far! There wasn't any chemistry between Rochester and Jane. She was a cold fish compared to what one imagines her character to be when reading the book. The only redeeming aspect was the scenery in this movie. Otherwise I would say it was a total flop!
2,Not the best Jane Eyre movie,"This movie evokes a great gothic mood and the outdoors shots are wonderful. The rest is forgettable. Presenting the movie in flashbacks is most likely very confusing for those viewers who did not read the book. There is not enough spunk in the portrayal of Jane and Rochester is too beautiful and flirty. The ending is chopped off and leaves one very disappointed. I much prefer the 70's production with George C. Scott and Susannah York, or the 1997 one with Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds."
1,Don't be fooled by the good reviews!,"Don't waste your money. This is by far the worst Jane Eyre I've ever seen. I didn't even finish it. The main actress plays Jane Eyre as if she is half asleep. There is no passion or spark to her performance. It's as if she has no interest in the role that she is playing. If she has no interest, why should we? (Note the young actresses playing Jane Eyre were great, but they're on the screen briefly.)"
2,Bad adaption!!!,"If you make Jane Eyre into a two hour movie you have to work extra hard to make sure it is not boring and dull, that time was not taken for this adaption. The director and the writer did not worry about such things as making a good film, they simply took out all the action and replaced with terrible dialog that made you want to fall asleep. The burning of the house, the accidents, his horrible crazy first wife Bertha, all explained away and not really shown. The acting, make-up and costumes were wonderful, but it could not save thing boring movie.If you'd like a good movie, see the masterpiece theater version from 2006, four hours well worth it."
3,Not the Best Version,"I was really looking forward to this as people had been raving about it. With such a deep and well done book as the template, how could it go wrong? Well, I wouldn't say that it ""went wrong"", but it's definitely not the best version out there. I think this one failed to show a budding romance, which is the key to the story. Nothing else works if there is no angst and love. They SAY they love each other, but the actors never show this. It's a good modern interpretation for someone who doesn't like long movies (the best one is much longer and more detailed), subtlety, or traditionally English movies. That, however, was NOT what I was looking for in Jane Eyre."
2,Displeased,"I will not go as far to say I hated this adaption but I very much disliked it. (Which I don't say too often about movies). First off, I was confused the first 5 minutes of the movie because the opening scene is about the halfway point of the story. Then it goes into 'flashback' scenes as Jane is 'remembering' what happened. Second, the story line was very rushed, lots of information was skipped and many characters left out. Third, the acting was only so-so and lacked the emotions that the characters should posses. Overall, it was a weak interpretation of the book and I probably won't make the effort to watch this one again."
1,disappointing,"This disjointed version of Jane Eyre is simply not worth the money. There was so little development of the relationship, having it leap from introduction to passion without any scenes to speak of to allow for this progression.The relationship between Eyre and her cousins is not developed at all, simply going randomly into ""choosing"" to be family without anything said of being cousins-- in fact, it is a fiction of sister and brother that is given without a foundation in relatedness as in the book-- this is a rather random and objectionable alteration.There are multiple movie versions of this book and several of them are far better!!I expect better from a BBC movie."
2,Disappointment,"I was excited to see this- it had some great reviews and Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books. This was a letdown. Perhaps a viewer who has not read the book would enjoy it, but I could not get into this adaptation. Thank goodness for Judi Dench, who was this movie's only saving grace."
3,Good but I've seen better...,"I could'nt wait to see this latest version of Jane Eyre because it received some glowing reviews. Some people liked it better then the miniseries with Timothy Dalton who is my favorite as ""Rochester"". I sat down in anticipation for a viewing. On many levels I was disappointed.The scenery, music and costumes were breathtaking. They were like a beautiful Victorian painting. That in my book is a well deserved 5 stars, unfortunately for me the rest fell flat. Mia Wasikowska did a fair job with the screenplay she had to work with. I felt Michael Fassbender was very dispassionate in his portrayal of Rochester, he gave him no depth. The only other portrayal of Rochester I've seen worse then his was William Hurt's. Judi Dench was stellar as always.I realize it's very difficult to cover all of Charlotte Bronte's classic novel in a 2 hour movie but I feel others have done a much better job of doing this.Suffice it to say Timothy Dalton is still my favorite ""Rochester"""
2,JANE AIRHEAD,"Sorry...but Jane Eyre was an intelligent and very opinionated girl full of energy and passion. This girl had very little personality at all, not enough for a master to take notice of a servant. Not even close. I blame the director. He seems to have taken more interest in Rochester's character while leaving poor Jane wondering around like someone had slipped a sedative in her drink."
3,Casting Good Movie To Short,I came across this 2011 version of Jane Eyre by accident. As I was watching the movie my eyes would glance at the clock and wonder how they were going to fit all the needed scenes into this movie. You can not see a Jane Eyre movie in 2 hours. That being said I believe the chemistry between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester was the best out of the previous versions. After the burning bed seen I could not wait to see more of that chemistry.It was not to be seen the movie went by so fast that useless you had seen previous versions you would have been lost as to what was happening. Let's cross our fingers maybe there is a longer version.Cross fingers
1,Beautiful but blah.,"I had considered buying this movie, but I decided to rent it first, which is a good thing. While the movie was filmed beautifully, there was little to no emotion conveyed by the characters. I got bored and fell asleep while watching it, and I love Jane Eyre. I felt as though there were many areas of the story that were not expounded upon in the way that they deserved to be, and there was no chemistry between Jane and Mr. Rochester! I suggest the Masterpiece Theatre version of Jane Eyre, if you're looking for a better retelling of the story. Yes, it's longer, but it's worth it.Masterpiece Theatre: Jane Eyre"
2,HATED THE ENDING,Though I love Jane Eyre this version didn't move me like the one before it! The end of the movie made me want to break my dvd and trash it! Although it was really good in detail in the beginning. And the cruetly that Little Jane endured was heart wrenching. I hated this adaptation. MY DVD watched only once is for sale! Any takers??!!!!!!!!!!
1,Disappointed,I pre ordered this and was really looking forward to seeing it but right from the first scenes I was very disappointed. I didn't like that they went on and on with her leaving and trudging around after discovering he was married before they finally got around to getting on with the story. Plus it gave away a latter part of the story. Then for a long time they jumped back and forth in the story. Nothing wrong with the casting. I thought all were good. I would just have preferred that the movie follow the book more closely. I wont look at it again and will resell it at a half price store.
1,The worst Jane Eyre,"I bought this movie after reading the reviews. What I've learned about Amazon reviews: everyone has unique opinions! As far as the physical stuff goes (colors, the look of the characters, mood) I loved. But the actual acting and story, terrible! If I hadn't have known the story, I wouldn't have been able to follow it. It was all mixed up, the acting was bla/boring, and there no chemistry between Jane and Rochester. Any other Jane Ayre adaptation is better than this!"
2,Subpar!,"I wanted to like this movie; I really did. However, I just did not get any emotions from the characters nor did the storyline flow well. I think my favorite is still the version with William Hurt & Charlotte Gainsbourg. BUMMER"
4,Just another perfect example of a literary classic on the big screen,I loved this version of the classic gothic novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. Michael and Mia make the most intriging pair.
4,Release the Director's Cut!,"This version of Jane Eyre is quite good. Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska are perfect together! However, this story can't be told in a mere 2 hours. This movie would be excellent if there were more/extended scenes with Rochester and Jane. The deleted scenes, part of the bonus material on this DVD, should all be in the film. For instance, the veil scene and Rochester chasing after Jane need to be included as they would provide more depth to the story. I will always love the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson version best, but this film is very moving. Again this film is very good, but it is too short--release an extended/director's cut version. Sign the petition for a director's cut on ipetitions."
1,Couldn't even finish it!,"This version was so poorly done I had to turn it off half-way through! There is no passion, no chemistry, no reason to believe these people would have ever fallen for each other. Of course I didn't watch the whole thing, but I did watch enough to know that I didn't believe their romance. By the time I turned it off they had bored me with parts that I thought they would have shortened but hadn't. They cut out important parts, like two of the conversations between Mr. R and Jane leading up to them falling for each other. The conversation they did have was dull, uninteresting and left me not liking Mr. R where in other versions it is the same conversation where one would start liking Mr. R. Will not watch again!"
1,Not so great Jane Eyre,"Everyone has been raving about this movie. I loved the book, but hated this movie. It was so drawn out and way too boring. I simply cannot believe that it had such good critic reviews. Watch older versions which are much better..."
5,Excellent adaptation,I loved this version of the movie. My all time favorite has to be the Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles version and this one is just as good. I loved the way it was filmed; the sequencing and the flow of the movie were perfect. The two actors gave fabulous perfomances. I really couldn't have asked for more. I was VERY hesitant to watch the movie; I've seen Pride and Prejudice ruined quite a few times but this is wonderful. Watch it. You'll be glad that you did.
3,New Twist On The Story,"Nearly the entire story is told as a flashback. The action keeps jumping between the present, and the past. There is no real developement of the relationship between Rochester and Jane, as was the case with the Masterpiece Theater production. I found the performances lacking in nuance and depth, as though I were being rushed through the story. Sort of ""let's get this overwith, since everyone already knows the story.""As to the DVD itself, the viewer must suffer through 5 minutes of trailers for other films, before the program begins. It is not possible to fastforward/search past the trailers. The effect of the trailers is to guarantee that I will NEVER BUY or VIEW ANY OF THOSE FILMS. Bad idea!"
1,Was it L'Amour Fou for You?,"If you were as disappointed in this production's failure to portray ""l'amour fou"" (the crazy love) between Jane and Rochester as I was, try the production William Hurt stars in,Jane Eyre. I was so looking forward to a new production of this classic but besides all Cary Fukumaga's forward flashes to the side flashes to the back flashes(found myself wondering if viewers that had never read the so well written book, would be able to keep up with all those chronolgical time jumps)there was simply no, zilch, nada, zero, nil chemistry between Mia Wasikowsk and Michael Fassbender. Huge downer! This film is so badly done and unlikely to capture the imagination of new fans that it will be another decade or two before anyone attempts to produce ""Jane Eyre"" again. Lovely scenery, but lovely scenery does not a love story make."
2,Jane Eyre is now a horror movie?,"Dark, too dark for Bronte. Watch if you're a fan, but it isn't something to buy and watch over and over again. After watching once I am done."
2,boooooooooring,"I've seen probably every single Jane Eyre version out there. This version was bleh. You really can't do Jane Eyre justice with 2hrs. I recommend the Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson version. Although I think Michael Fassbender is mighty good looking I just didn't buy his performance as Mr. Rochester. I started laughing when Mia gave her ""just because I'm poor"" speech...horrible."
2,Disappointed...,"Jane Eyre is one of the best novels of all time, and I feel like this movie does not do it justice. I've seen quite a few adaptions of the film and I cannot understand how this can be a favorite, but to each his own, I suppose. The mini-series from Masterpiece Theatre (2007) is much, much better. This movie begins right as Jane is running away from Mr. Rochester and the movie is basically a series of flashbacks. It leaves out so much from the book and after watching it I was completely disappointed. As many movie adaptions as there are of the novel already I was expecting something a little better. It seemed like a waste. I, personally, would not recommend it."
3,I've seen better...,"Overall it's not a bad movie, but it's far from good. Jane Eyre is a love story, a tortured and true enduring love story...this movie is not that. I've seen better versions, the 1943 Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine version has more feeling and depth then this. Shoot, just about every version I've ever seen tells more of the story and has more feeling then this. I've loved the dark and haunting story of Jane Eyre since I first read the book ten or so years ago, and I had such high hopes for this the latest screen adaptation of the novel, but I must say I am so greatly disappointed."
1,DISAPPOINTED,left out half of the movie...no intimate personal conversations between the two that explain their relationship and how they felt about each other. I was very disappointed in this movie.
3,good but not best.,"They did an acceptable job with this remake, but if you are looking for a really good adaptation of this story, I highly recommend the version with Toby Stephens. It's much longer (about 5 hours as opposed to 2-ish) but does a more thorough job and the emotions are much more palpable. If you're not too particular about your British Romantic novel remake movies, this one is perfectly adequate."
4,Nice Home/SOHO Studio Component Rackspace,"The construction is solid and square. Once populated the Rack looks great. The screw rails are thick gauge steel -however no screws are provided to affix components. 10/32 and 10/24 screws are common so get both if in doubt however it appears for the units I received 10/24 screws were required. The manufactures website stealthily concealed this information. There are rubber feet fastened using woodscrews at the base of the unit. These can strip out of the unit when sliding the assembly into position for example under a desk over carpeted floors. Once this occurs only wood glue and time can resolve the issue. Removing them makes for easier repositioning in this scenario. The carpet is a short knap variety wrapped neatly over the wood framework, but there may be some loose carpet corners. These seem to be a real value in an otherwise pricy utility furniture market.10/32 Screw for Rack, 50 pcs Black12/24 Screw for Rack, 50 pcs Black"
2,"Not really a ""Special Edition"" Soundtrack....","Yeah, ummm Disney, ya went wrong ONCE AGAIN!This soundtrack only has three new songs as followed:Dancing on a Cloud (Demo) (Only really new track which is already on the DVD)Beautiful (On Jim Brickman's The Disney Songbook CD)Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes (On Disney Mania 3)So if you already own the original soundtrack, Jim Brickman's awesome Disney CD, Disney Mania 3 CD, and the Cinderella Special Edition DVD... PLEASE skip this CD.Thank you! :)"
3,Need Help,"Can anyone tell me if there are lyrics to the song ""So This is Love"" on this CD. I am looking for a CD that has the lyrics as well as the music to this song."
4,Me encantó,Muy bonito su diseño y ningún problema con el funcionamiento. Puesto que el tamaño de la manilla es único no se puede graduar a la muñeca y me quedó un poco grande.
5,Working Class Dog CD,I ordered this Rick Springfield CD along with several others as a gift for my daughter. She was really happy to get them. I received them quicker than I expected and in excellent conditiion.
4,Fun craft!,"We made the cars with 3 boys (ages 8, 7 and 4) and it was a lot of fun. It was difficult for the boys to wait for the plaster to dry, but they really loved decorating with the blow pens. They started out playing rough with the cars and so they got a couple of chips in them, but they still work! The boys were proud that they made them, each had their own color."
4,"Insightful, Suspenseful, and Entertaining","What a great read! If you are looking for a little fun, some suspense, and pleasant way to wile away an afternoon, join the Desperate Pastors' Wives at Lulu's Café. You'll soon be thinking of them as girlfriends. As they congregate to share gossip, fears, and speak their minds, you may just find answers to dilemmas in your own life. These women face secrets from their past, problems in their present, and deal with very real challenges that come not only to pastors' wives, but are common struggles of women everywhere."
4,Liked this book!,"Now I KNOW pastor's wives are imperfect like the rest of us, and face the same problems. This was in interesting and down to earth book."
4,Great read!,"Delightful review of real life challenges these desperate pastors' wives face. Humor helps lighten the difficult challenges they face, and they are open to hearing and learning how to make changes that lead to the kind of intimate relationships they desire with these men of God who are pulled in many directions."
2,Extremely disapointed.,"I bought this book thinking that since I had been a ""Desperate pastor's Wife"" at one time thinking i could identify with it and being i love mysteries-of which it stated it was-I was disapointed. It was silly and had very little of what could be called, ""Mystery"" about it. It was a light read for those that might like that, but I like a little more substance."
5,Hiliarious!,"This is an amazing, independently-produced comedy tv game show spoof. A refreshing mix of intelligent parody and creative improvisation, this show will take off like a rocket if picked up by someone like Comedy Central! Much funnier than something like 'Who's Line is it Anyway?"", this is the kind of TV I've been waiting for..."
4,So cute!,Love this sweatshirt- it's fitted for a woman. Warning though- this means it runs a little small (especially if you may shrink it in the wash). I usually wear a size 4 or 6 and the Medium is snug on me.
3,Touch the Sun,"Enjoyed this gentle, touching romantic story. Particularly enjoy the amount ofresearch that goes into the history surrounding the stories."
2,could have been great,"OMG!! i wanted to pull my hair out. what could have been a terrific story ended up making me so frustrated with the author. great plot, but why the back and forth between the lead characters. the heroine decides she's no pushover and then she is a pushover, one touch and she is back in bed with the hero, forget her pride or resolve, which is supposed to be tremendous. if this is the case, why not just reveal who she was? neither one had any honor and i can't fathom that this scenario could have taken place in this time period."
5,good book,I got this book because I love to read anything romantic. From reading the a little on the book this will a great book to read.
1,"Couldn't finish it, too raunchy","I love a good historical romance, but does it really have to be so graphic and blatantly sexual? Is it that romance these days aren't enough anymore? Pu-leese. I couldn't finish it, the author ruined a potentially good story about 25% of the way through when it turned explicit. I chose a one star only because I couldn't hit -100. It was free, and I'm so glad I didn't waste more of my time with it."
3,great but on Youtube for free,"Martin Akin has some very sensible advice and worth the time to check this out, though sadly it is 95% available online at YouTube.So check yourself at the door and know that this DVD is really a video overview of what the book has to offer. the book is much more the real deal. this is the kinda of tour of tour smart!"
5,The Valuable Guide,"I found this book to be a very essential reference in my new practice. I find the format to be well laid out and easy to use in a hurry. This book is written in a very easily understood manner and would be a valuable asset for students, PAs, nurse practitioners, and physicians. I highly recommend this book for all medical practitioners."
3,not so good..,"I had Dr.Ferri's pocket book and found it quite practical when I was a medical student a few years ago. This time I have this ""big book"" and feel a little disappointed.The part I is not bad to provide quick refresh for some common diseases.However, the part II--differential diagnosis-- is really in a mess.I always think for a symptom or sign too many differential diagnosis mean no diagnosis.In part II the author give us too many columm too many chart and too many D.D which make this part very impractical.It's pity."
5,This is truly one of the best christmas albums ever made!,"I listened to this album every christmas while I was growing up in the 60's and 70's. I never forgot about it especially at christmas, earlier this year while rummaging through some old albums at my mother's I came across it but it is so badly scratched and worn out and beside the fact that we no longer have a turntable to listen to it with, this album by far is so wonderful. It has something for everyone on it. How could anyone ever forget her version of ""Ding a Ling the Christmas Bell"". Please re-release this album. You wouldn't go wrong that's for sure. It would certainly be loved by all age groups."
5,This is the best Christmas album of all time.,"When my brother, sisters and I were small my mother used to play this wonderful album. She would sing her heart out I tell you. I must have this album. I have been looking for years. Please reissue!!!!"
5,I HAVE THIS CHRISTMAS ALBUM ON CD ON EBAY!,"Who doesn't love Lynn Anderson's ""The Christmas Album""? See Ebay now through Christmas for the Sony 1995 Collector's Edition CD of the original LP, released in 1972, that we all love and treasure! Order NOW to get for Christmas 2002. This CD is all original recordings and includes the beloved ""Ding-a-Ling the Christmas Bell"". This is one of the best Christmas CDs ever -- a classic CD by a classic artist!"
5,Childhood Memories,"My mother was a huge Lynn Anderson fan. As a child, I loved listening to her albums. Her Christmas album was a treasured part of our family's music library. My sister and I grew up with ""Ding-A-Ling"", ""Mr. Mistletoe"" and all the other one-of-a-kind songs on this album. We can hardly wait to get our CD and share this special holiday music with our own children.Shauna Steed"
5,please reissue this cd.,"i can't find the cd anywhere. my mom has the record, but i need the cd. please reissue it."
5,Enjoyable,"Its nice to watch short film, they are unfortunately not recognized all the time - and this is an example that they should be. We have some talented filmmakers out there doing great stuff. I especially enjoy Hidden Child, this eerie look into a long time secret. The cinematography was beautiful, and the acting was really first class!"
3,Limited Usefulness,Not what i expected. Of limited usefulness. Have to use a large amount to get the desired flavor effect. Ends up being more costly than other ways to flavor.
2,Rootbeer Stevia,"Too Sweet - Not enough RootBeer Flavor.Kids hate it, I wouldn't recommend it.The Grape flavor isn't much better - just too sweet."
3,Not as flavorful as I had hoped.,"I had got this hoping to make a lower calorie substitute for traditional Root Beer. I got some Club Soda and added the Stevia. I quickly found out that the amount of Stevia I would have to add to get some actual root beer flavor would have been drowned out by how sweet it would be.It does taste like root beer, just very lightly. So if you're hoping to add a lot of Root Beer Flavor I think you'll be disappointed. For a light flavor this would work out great!"
4,I'm on my second bottle!,"While I do wish the rootbeer flavor was more intense, I do enjoy using the flavoring in soda water made using my SodaStream. I've also used this flavor when cooking pulled pork -- my old recipe called for rootbeer but I can't use sugar anymore so I try some drops of this -- not bad! I've also added a few drops when making BBQ sauce to add just a touch of sweetness."
2,If this is Root Beer..,"Sorry, but maybe I am expecting too much. I tried hard to detect a true root beer flavor. Just didn't taste it."
2,Not a good root beer flavor,"I am a fan of different flavor enhancers, but this root beer flavor is too far off. The stevia sweetener is nice and strong, but the root beer flavor just isn't there. Comparing this product to the more well known flavor enhancers like Mio, Mio wins hands down. This stevia product didn't live up to my expectation for a nice root beer."
2,hate it,"i already wrote a review on this product in the english toffee flavor and it clearly states that i like the concept of the product but not the nasty bitter taste. if you use 1 or 2 drops its not sweet enough, 3 or more drops and its a bitter sweet taste. i still have 2 almost full bottles send a self addressed envelope and i will send you mines for free. will never purchased this product again and this is coming from someone who don't eat regular sugar at all so i wasn't expecting an overly sweet taste!"
2,Didn't work for my family - YUCK!,"I saw this, and did a lot of reading, as I have a rather bad Pepsi habit that I need to quit. It sounded like the best product on the market, so we bought one bottle to test.Whether I used ice water, tap water, 1 drop or 20 drops, it simply is not drinkable to me, and my lovely wife feels the same way too. She uses a different product which she loves, but we ended up tossing this out. I am not saying it's bad, but for two people anyhow, it wasn't for us."
4,a flavor that i am going to try,I ordered this product to try and i am still trying to figure a way to incorporate it in to my diet but if it is like the other flavors that i have ordered and tried it will be delish
2,Electric (Battery Operated) Football Set,"The title of this game (Electric Football) is somewhat deceiving -- it is battery operated. The ""players"" themselves appear to be a cheap imitation of the game I remember 30 years ago...."
2,"High capacity, slow performance","A 16GB USB drive is exactly what I wanted.However, the performance is horrendous. It took 4 minutes to write 100 1MB files. That's 375 KB/second, not even 1 MB/second.""Drive E: 265.774902 seconds for 100 iterations (0.376258 iterations per second)"""
5,Great 4th Season,"This season has surpassed my expectations with as many beautiful locations, costumes, people and intriguing plots as ever. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Excellent show!,"I've been a fan of Alias since it was on TV, and recently completed my DVD collection with season 4. If you like drama with the odd bits of comedy and a lot of action, and if you like strong female leads, you'll love Alias."
3,Way up in places...but also waaaaaaaaaay down!,"Just like the little girl who had a little curl right in the middle of her forehead, the season's good parts were very very good, and the bad parts were horrid! I'm a fan so I had to buy it, but oh! It was so uneven."
4,Alias rocks,"Eventhough i have watched every episode of Alias and own the DVDS and soundtracks, season 4 did not live up to its potential. It did have a better, more intertesting season finale then season three. But i still miss the costumes and what seems tome the fun that was i season 1 and 2. In those seasons Sydney seemed to be able to have fun and her life was not so, sad. Even now with Vaughn, her sister, wiess, and her father is finally on her side. She doesn't seem content. I did like this season better then season 3 but seasons one and two really do kick seasons 3 and 4's butt."
3,Used to be my favorite,"Trying to win more fans over and putting it on the same night as Lost, well, they watered it down, kinda like they did with the last season of Angel. Abandoned most of what made it good, lost the arc and went for individual episodes. In the process it lost it's edge and is less fun. It didnt really get good until the last half of the season. Bringing back Mommy helped a lot.With it up against Smallville, OC, Survivor and whatever NBC has to offer (Joey?) Season 5 is sure to be it's last."
3,Good but not the best,Had some trouble playing in my dvd player. but i would buy again. The series rocks so one disk with a little trouble at the start didnt hurt my feelings
4,"Alias, Season 4","I have watched every episode of Alias. It was the best show on TV until they ruined it. Season 4 is kind of like the original 3 seasons. They could have done so much more though. Still it is good. I just wish it could have lasted a few more years. Excellent cast and story line. I highly recommend watching all 5 seasons, but don't expect Season 5 to resemble Seasons 1 through 3."
5,Great Show that doesn't have a woman as the victim,"I love Alias just for the fact that it is generally the man who is in need of rescue. It is nice to see a strong female lead on television. The entire ensemble is great. I love thet way they play off each other as if they have been together for a very long time. This was a great season, but the season finale was a little more sci-fi than I felt necessary."
3,When Things Recycle Themselves,"Alias is one of the greatest shows ever created. It has always been totally cinematic and of thatrical quality....until now. Seasons 1 and 2 where the greatest and season three wasn't half bad. Season 4 on the other hand takes the series on a nose dive. That is if you like originality and action. Season 4 can best be described as a woman's version of Alias. Too much useless sentimentality and wasted chances. It also attempts to bring the series full circle with a return to roots. Sloan returns as the head of the newly established PNE (Private No Entry) While interesting it is ultimately a let down. I morn the passing of good television. But if you like chick flicks or wanted less suspense or action and the end of Sydney's awful season 3 hairdo...go ahead and buy this. At least her new sister is hot, makes Sydney look awfully bad....Maybe season 5 will be better. But I doubt it. Seasons 1-3 are must owns."
5,ALIAS WILL ALWAYS BE ON TOP!!,"I'VE ALWAYS LOVED ALIAS FROM DAY ONE NO MATTER WHAT THE SEASON!! IT'S JUST AWESOME! JENNIFER GARNER KICKS BUTT WITH FLAIR! SHE LOOKS COOL WITH ALL HER OUTFITS AND WIGS AND THE MUSIC GOES WELL WITH ALL THE SCENES! KINDA MAKES YOU WANT TO BE LIKE HER, HUH?!! I'M SAD TO SEE THAT IT ENDED WITH SEASON 5. EVER SINCE IT DEBUTED, IT'S BEEN NOTHING BUT ACTION, ADVENTURE, ROMANCE, THE WHOLE WORKS! I LOVE ALL THE DIFFERENT PLACES AND COUNTRIES THEY WENT ON MISSIONS TO. FANTASTIC JOB GUYS! ALL I NEED LEFT IS SEASON 5 TO COMPLETE MY ALIAS COLLECTION! LOVE IT!! THANK GOODNESS FOR DVDS!"
2,Losing steam,"Alias is gradually losing momentum in the fourth season. There are still some good moments, but Rambaldi stories become more and more painstaking. The end is just laughing stock. After this series, I stopped watching Alias."
3,Season 4 a bit of a Mixed Bag,"I just finished Season 4 of Alias. I have been waiting with great anticipation ever since I heard Lena Olin was coming back. I must admit it was nice to have Irina back, but Season 4 is no Season 2. Season 4 was a mixed bag, with some clever twists in place - but all too often riding the same mediocre wave that carried Season 3. I've been following the series on DVD ever since Season 1 hooked me. Its likely what's kept me coming back.In addition to the return of Irina(which was far too short-lived), we also got ""The Clone"" which was acutally on par with some of the former seasons' ""didn't see that coming"" moments. The plot line of the final two episodes was a bit of a letdown, contributing to that whole Season 3 vibe. All in all, I will buy Season 5, if for no other reason to give JJ and crew a chance to redeem themselves and possibly return us to the glory of the early days. I'd like to think this won't be our parting moments with Irina."
5,"Suspense, mystery, action, and even romance...what a show!","Alias may not make it as a weekly TV show...the continuity is lost. But if you have the ability to watch a few shows at a time or continue every day to view some of the episodes...it becomes very engaging. I found myself having a difficult time trying to stop and save some for the next day.The story line has a nice continuity and characters are well established. There are always surprises in every episode. Special effects are well done, too graffic at times but it makes for a believable story. The research and background investigated for the show make you wonder how much of this is science fiction and how much of this is from real life.Thanks for having this available on Amazon!"
3,A Bit Disappointed...,"I have ordered seasons one through four of alias through Amazon. The first three had no problems, but the fourth season was a bit disappointing. When i opened the package, plastic pieces immediately fell out; the DVD casing had cracked. Inside the cracking was bad as well, and the pieces that hold four center discs had been broken completely. So four of the discs are just jumbling around inside the DVD case, and the indentation where you open it is essentially useless as all the plastic has cracked off.In the end, the problem was minor. The discs themselves have functioned flawlessly so far and my girlfriend and i are enjoying Season Four a lot. Don't let this incident be a deal-breaker, as $23 shipped is a great price, but don't be surprised if it comes a bit damaged."
3,Alias 4 was not as good as the previous seasons!!,"This season did not live up to the standards of seasons 1-3.We are waiting for something to happen, but nothing is developing!!I am a little sad that less effort was put into seasons 4.:("
5,Alias is back... and kicking more ass then ever!!!,"Man were do i start. well first of all i do need to say that the fourth season dvd packaging is the best one so far. i dont know if its because i like red alot, but just the way they manage to make this set is brilliant. keep up the good work!!!With that sed, season four retuns to its roots. after that dreadful third season i really tought alias was done for, thank god i was wrong. this season brings back all that classic magic you love from season one and two and mixes it up with its own power impact taste. From it season premier to those unexpected last seconds of the final episode you will be beging for more alias. One last thing: cliff hanger way better than season 3."
4,Great Season! But not the best,"Season 4 of Alias was certianly better than Season 3, but still does not live up to Seasons 1 and 2. I liked a lot of the story lines, which in the beginning seemed to have nothing to do with each other, but in the end it all came together. It was great to see many old faces back, and especially Lena Olin! I was sooo excited to see her back!I cannot wait for the next season, and hopefully it won't be the last."
2,Incredible...flamed out in the end,"The first three seasons were epic. The well thought out plot kept you engaged and guessing. The final two seasons four and five were a huge drop off with dangling plot lines and useless tangents. I kept watching because the foundation laid for the show was so strong I really cared about what happened to the characters. But the resolution was so weak it made me wish the story ended in the third season.That being said, the final two seasons are vastly superior to the majority of shows on television today."
2,Alias series,"First two years of this series were pretty good. Third season went downhill, fourth season was weak to start, but picked up. Good acting and effects. Overall pretty good series for 5 seasons. I will probably watch it again."
5,Box set was a gift for my wife,"It appeared to satisfy my wife's wishes quite well. She's a fan of the show. I'm not, but I'm a fan of Jennifer Garner.I'm guessing she won't be quite as interested in the Season 5 set. Seems she thinks the show has flagged a bit this year. But I'll probably get it for her anyway, just to complete the set."
1,Worst season ever,This season crearly shows that J.J. Abrams is commited to something else (Lost?). That zombie thing in the final chapters must be a bad joke. The killer robot helicopter chapter was nonsense.I'm very disappointed with the whole season.
3,"Not Bad, But not my Favorite","I'm heading to West Point next year and love reading about it, especially from a female's point of view. It's very slow which is annoying, but it's very detailed, which gives good pointers for my plebe summer. I wish it was her entire experience, not just CBT. Other great books on this topic are Absolutely American and Tough as Nails."
3,Good Book on West Point,"Efaw tells a realistic story about Andi Davis, a young girl that leaves an unstructured, dysfunctional home for the structured, dysfunctional system of West Point. The trials that Andi endured seemed very realistic. Efaw, however, does simplify the Cadet rank structure for the benefit of the reader. Over all, I found the book entertaining and enjoyable."
4,Courtesy of Chick Loves Lit,"I had previously read a book by Amy Efaw and was intrigued to find Battle Dress when searching for books at my local library. The summary seemed interesting enough, and it definitely ended up that way, too.The entire plot is based on a young girl's journey through West Point. This means a lot of discipline, gender roles/issues, and self reflection.I found the plot and characters to be quite fascinating, even if I was surprised at the activities they were forced to do sometimes. The characters were well built, clearly progressing from the beginning to the end of the book/their experience.I would love to read a sequel about their second year at West Point, but I haven't found any information hinting that that may be a possibility. Boo!"
4,Who Knew!,"Being a Viet Nam veteran, but in a different part of the war, I found this book fascinating. The way he shows how a mindset needs to be in order to survive is spot on. What I really enjoyed is how he showed life on the ground. Two different lives, in the air and on the ground but actually it is one. He brought back a lot of memories and believe it or not a lot of good ones. You know a book is good when you can visualize what is going on and relate to it. God bless to all the FAC's who were in Nam and especially to my cousin who was mentioned in this book."
5,Very good - with real take-home value,We used this book as a template for defining our strategic vision and corporate culture for a 75 person growing tech company. The insights on building a company for the long-term are simple but valuable and practical. I recommend it highly.
4,A Great Book for Leaders,"Collins and Porras have provided a foundational study of the nuts and bolts of ""visionary"" organizations. Built to Last is a great book. I was occasionally concerned that they sometimes used materials from other disciplines (i.e., evolutionary science, symbols from Eastern religions, etc.) that had significant implications. Overall, the book is an excellent read and would be helpful for business owners, managers, non-profit leaders, and a whole range of educators and civil servants. I would highly recommend it. One will be amazed to see the impact that a few consistent priorities have had on some of the major companies. It's a worthwhile book that is backed by real data.Paul Heier, pastor, Lifespring Church, Palm Harbor, FL"
3,"Some good ideas, some terrible audio","There is some good work in this audio book, although, to quote a friend, it's about 20 minutes of good information that they somehow crammed onto two hours of tape. The various points are belabored well past any argument for helpful review.But the real shame is that the narration is SO terrible. These guys may be researchers, but they can't read out loud. The narration is bad to the extent that it simply hurts the book. Business audio, unfortunately, is such that you normally need to listen through more than once, and it's just too terrible to contemplate in this case. Why Harper Audio did not insist on a trained voice to read this tape suggests that, as a company, perhaps THEY aren't built to last."
4,Amazing Book!!,"I had to read this book for my management course and I thought it was going to be yet another boring business book, but IT IS AMAZING!! The authors made me completely rethink how I think companies achieve success and had some of the most in depth research I've come across.It doesn't matter if you're in business or not, no matter who you are, you'll enjoy getting a fresh perspective that applies to business and our personal lives too. The book slows down towards the end, but overall it's a must read!"
3,A Familiar Story,"""Built to Last"" is very similar to the book of Peters and Waterman in terms of content and composition with a little difference, that is methodologically this book is stronger because the theory is worked to be proved by investigating two companies in selected sectors, one of which is very successful and the other is less successful or completely a failure.You can find important considerations concerning leadership and its mission and function for an organization. The vitality of organizational values, innovation and running risk, challenging goals, organization culture, vision etc., are stressed by the authors. This book is one of the books which propose time and culture free universal principles. You may be pleased by rhetoric, but you must be alert.Overall, I recommend this book to readers who have not yet read ""In Search of Excellence""."
5,"Next best Book to ""Good to Great""",This is a great book and learning tool. It was great to order and it showed up on schedule too!
4,"This was a gift, but the report is that the books are very informative.",I gave these books as a Christmas gift - The person that I gave them to reports that the books are very informative and helpful.
3,"Ok, but not as good as Good to Great","I don't have much to say about this book. I am finishing reading it now; it took me 2 years off and on to finish it. It seemed like more of a chore to read than Good to Great, which is funny because I had to read Good to Great for a class and I am reading Built to Last ""for fun"".It's a good business book, their research and conclusion makes sense, and their are some good stories about the various companies in there. However, the book is dry at times, which makes it hard and not very enjoyable to read.If you want to learn about the prequel to Good to Great, read this. It's a good book. But, if you're looking for something entertaining to read, you probably need to find something else: read Good to Great if you haven't read that or go to the fiction section."
4,Very enlightening.,The greatest thing about the audio book is the tantalizing study of the engine of great companies that has can have impact for any business or life. Sum it up in one word: vision is what's needed. But there's more to say than just that. I found the book extremely useful and learned simple but exciting truths from it! (The only thing I didn't like about the audio book is that it is an abridgement and some of the detailed company comparisons were left out.)
5,Insightful book,"This book was a required reading for my managemnt class and it's the first time i have ever read a ""textbook"" from cover to cover and completed it before the class ended. A must read for every working professional."
4,An interesting book,"Among the plethora of ""how to succeed"" management books, most of them just an exercise in trying to create a bestseller, this one stands out as bringing some fresh insight and information about succesful companies. Apart from Peter Drucker, the only genuine intelectual writing about business, this is one of the few management books worth reading."
5,A must for anyone interested in human performance mgmt.,"An instant classic for those of us who consult with organizations that seek to improve performance. Universal principles that have stood the test of time have been presented in a concrete and interesting fashion. Only three notes of caution are advised. First, the selection and head-to-head comparsions of the companies presented represents a relatively small sample from which broad and important generalizaions are drawn. Second, what would the implications be of a ""fall from grace"" of a company honored with the title of ""visionary company?"" Finally what if your company,(like a few of my clients)is short term focused toward becoming an attractive take-over target? Do these habits have short term value? This is a book you will refer to again and again."
3,Repetition makes this a short book,"This book states a premise at the beginning of each chapter and then overdoses the reader with multitudes of examples. These get too be quite long and are very selective in how they praise companies. The authors don't take any position on the morality of how companies got into their group. For example, Phillip Morris makes their list as a great visionary company. If this is the case, the Columbian drug dealers should have made the list as well. Also, Wal-Mart makes the list. How they treat their suppliers is absolutely deplorable and their effect on the communities they put their stores in is catastrophic. Nice club to belong to. Overall the book is sort of disjointed and too long. Does have some good points, however and should be skimmed (skipping the plethora of examples) and some of its core ideas should be used in running companies."
1,Disappointing,"Habits are in, habits sell, at least in titles, but I would have preferred the authors to be more original. I guess they didn't figure they could get away with ""The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Companies.""Aside from the title, I had to wonder if they spent more time trying to squeeze the companies they covered into their preconceived list of habits than they did actually examining those companies. Those familiar with any of the companies might have trouble recognizing them here. Reality seldom fits into such simplistic molds."
4,"Good ideas, decent presentation","The book is good for those looking at the big picture of company management - but it also applies to smaller teams or personal goals. I have not read widely in this field, but I found the book easy to read and fairly entertaining."
1,Should be from bad to worse,"Despite trying very hard to deny that this is just another fad management book - there is nothing new in this title. Clueless managers will recite the core principals of this book and treat them as gospel as they try to improve their bottom line. It is also worth noting that at least one of the ""great"" organizations in the book, Fannie May, has imploded in an accounting scandal. Not the worst fad management book ever written, but that isn't saying much."
1,Built to last,Built ot last is the copy of in search of excellence.I do not know why he copied it and get away with it.Thanks
1,The Most Worthless Book I ever Read,"I was unfortunate enough to have to read this book for a Plant Management training program. I found this book to be inane and the conclusions drawn by the authors to be ridiculous and uninformed. Further, the ""case studies"" presented in the book are incomplete and involve an obvious ""slant"" based on the personal opinions of the authors. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN OBTAINING ANY USEFUL INFORMATION. This book should not rate even 1 star."
3,Good not great!,"Simply put, this is good but not nearly as impactful as ""Good to Great"" by Jim Collins."
5,Great Book!!! Must read it!!!,A really good and eye opening book. I found really interesting the correlations that the writers observe that exist. The finding s seem to be in line with the new sustainability trend. I totally recommend it to anyone concerned about businesses.
5,A clasic must read,An absolute must read along with the follow on Built to Last. The extensive research behind this book is evident and the conclusions may surprise you. If your current business isn't everything you want it to be you may find the answers here.
1,Not the real thing,"Everything about this listing says Canon Fx-2. However, you receive a ""Ikon"" facsimile cartridge, not a ""Canon FX-2"". I have ALWAYS used the factory toner, and that may be why my office fax machine has lasted over 15 years without any service needed. I WILL be sending these back!"
3,Ok not Great...,"Having used Dr. Frank's Pain Relief product on a regular basis and having 100% positve results (a fantastic product which I highly recommend!) I thought I would try the Allergy Relief product. Only had modest results and probably would not purchase it again...however different things work for different people, I would suugest you try it once and judge for yourself."
5,A Standout Patch for movie collecto,"This patch will stand out on anything you put it on for sure. I'm a big fan of Top Gun movie and this would add to my Top Gun collection. It looks great on every thing more so, 100% satisfied. Great authentic product."
2,my review,I did not like it because it was too graphic.I would not recommend this movie for anyone under the age of 13.This movie is more for people age 18 or older.
4,Rape Revenge,I was around in the 70's but never saw this movie.....too busy I guess. I do not like horror movies but I was curious about the revenge factor here. WOW! You won't fall asleep during this movie.
2,Curiosity fulfilled,Just curious as to differences of the versions. After comparing the versions my curiosity was fulfilled. Just a typical B movie.
3,Expensive,"I was surprised by the price. I've reviewed the recipes, but haven' tried any yet. It's a very pretty book."
