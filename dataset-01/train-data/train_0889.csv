5,sublime slide guitar,"Robert Randolph plays a pedal steel that competes in a league with Duane Allman. OK, Allman is the best. However, this is the best slide - or pedal steel played like a slide - that has been available since Duane left this planet. If you enjoy great guitar music, you can not be without this album. Robert Randolph has other albums out, but none has lived up to the Word. Since he is still young, maybe Robert Randolph will blow us away in the future - he is certainly capable - but until then, this album features the best slide playing in this millenium."
5,WOW!!!,"On any normal day this would not be my style of music, but for some reason the word just does it right. i borrowed it from a friend who said i had to hear it even though i said i don't like their style of playing, but once i heard it i bought it like 15 minutes later. please do yourself a favor and pick this up. if you are saying to yourself ""i don't like gospel/blues style"", believe me you will like this."
5,"If my church was this good, I'd still go!","The spotlight on this album goes to the young pedal steel player, and it is well deserved. He plays sweet, smooth, innovative, and soulful. No mean feat for a kid to shine when playing with guys like Luther Dickinson and John Medeski. I love every track on this recording. It's all instrumental gospel with a rootsy feel. I'm a natural grouch and this record makes me feel happy and hopeful.I'm a lousy guitar player, but the music I have focused on is pretty much the same as the music on the recordings that Luther Dickinson has been been putting out with the allstars & etc. I really appreciate the work he is doing."
2,OK but dated,"It's my own fault, but I failed to notice that this book was published in 2004. I'm sure it was excellent then, but today, much of the info contained in the book is dated, many of the websites mentioned no longer exist, and the ipod technology of today (2007) has rendered much of the interesting stuff that can't be found elsewhere obsolete. If Mr. Knaster should release a second, more current edition, I'd buy it."
5,"Great tips, fun read, unique book","This book has lots of iTunes tips I had not heard before. Author seems to have connections to people at Apple so he gets the good stuff. Good sections on how to change your iPod battery and how to find and copy specific songs on iPod. Tells how to download and read email and rss on ipod -- I didn't know you could do that. Nice, easy tone. Recommended."
2,Hacking in the sense that bubblegum is food,"As the reviewer below suggests, this isn't a book so much about how to find cool new features/things to do with your Ipod as it is an instruction manual similar to what should have been supplied with the device to begin with. Most of the info either is available online or somewhat obvious, given the intuitiveness/limitations of the Itunes software and the UI of the device itself.As much as I was hoping otherwise, this book isn't worth the money. Not even particularly for anyone uncomfortable with technology....If you really want to improve how your Ipod operates, check out Anapod Explorer, and spend the money there that you would have spent on this."
1,nothing new or interesting,Everything in the book has been mentioned before on various web sites. Don't waste your time or money.
3,OK but...,"These are OK but the supplied adapters did not fit my truck (Nissian Frontier). They kept comming loose. needed to ""glue"" on w/ silicone.They look good though!"
3,Mediocre at best,"I had heard the ""Knockin on Heaven's Door"" track on Pandora and had to get this song. I ended up buying the CD, unforturnately. The band needs a lot of refining. The music is quite good, but the lyrics sound like they were written by a high schooler, which essentially turns you off of the music. Their version of Heaven's Door is the best on the album, but it too comes up short. Reggae is my favorite genre of music,and I'm always looking for a new band or tune to get my adrenaline up. This album: not quite."
4,average read.......,"This was a good book but not great. In some places, it was a little slow and failed to deliver what seemed to be a high point in the plot. Lots of scandalous behaviour.....it's a great book to read on a lazy afternoon when there's nothing else to do."
4,Faithful portrayal of Fleming's life,"Another reviewer here says that SPYMAKER, the TV movie starring Jason Connery (Sean's son) is better. That's really a matter of personal opinion. But as a long-time James Bond fan and collector, not only of the films but of the original Ian Fleming books, I can tell you unequivocally that GOLDENE EYE is a much more accurate portrayal of the life of Ian Fleming.Another major plus is that Charles Dance actually looks like Fleming, and manages to mimic his voice and mannerisms quite well, based on the archival footage I've seen of Fleming. Jason Connery doesn't even come close -- he was obviously cast because of his father's reputation.If you're looking for a purely fictionalized fantasy, only loosely suggested by Fleming's wartime career, then you might enjoy SPYMAKER. But if you want the true story, I highly reccommend GOLDEN EYE. I also strongly reccommend the Ian Fleming documentary which is included on the special edition DVD of THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS."
5,"Best of Ian Fleming Movies - Charles Dance ""EXCELLENT""","This is the best of the two Life of Ian Fleming movies made about 10 years ago. This is also the closest to his actual life. The other movie took many liberties and fictionalized many aspects of his life, mostly during the war. Excellent job by Charles Dance as Ian Fleming. Dance actually played a villain in, 'For Your Eyes Only' in 1981. Well worth getting a copy for your collection. Sadly it is not yet available in DVD."
3,99% fiction,"This is a highly fictionalized account of the late Ian Fleming's role in the 1939-1945 war. As fiction it is very entertaining, but as history it is total trash.Unlike the account in this film, Ian spent the whole war as a minor desk jockey in England. His relationship with two women are accurately portrayed. The part about Stevenson is also fiction. In fact, the book about him called ""The Man Called Intrepid"" has a preface by the British publisher that it is 100% fiction.The appearance by Phyllis Logan is very good. She is a very versatile actress realistically portraying the whole range from a morally sleazy woman in this film to a quality woman in Lovejoy."
2,More Dry Than a Vodka Martini,"I first saw this made-for-TV movie about 7 years ago. I thought it was really interesting. Charles Dance does an excellent job portraying Ian Fleming. This isn't James Bond, there aren't any secret gadgets or humorous one-liners. This is the life story of Ian Fleming. It's a bit dry and seems to drag on in spots. Spymaker is better, but if you're a bond collector it's worth having."
3,I'm giving up,"Like a lot of books on writing this one is well written and even interesting, but it really isn't what the subtitle suggests. I'm making myself a rule not to buy any more books on writing unless I'm at the bookstore and can actually look through them."
2,No middle ground,"The interviews with published mystery authors are worth some time, but this book suffers greatly from a ""tell, don't show"" inversion of the classic advice to authors. Lots of direction, though it's very general (make sure your characters are interesting), and lots of ""but not too much"" (make sure you characters are interesting, but not too quirky). Very little direction about how to accomplish those goals. It falls into my category of yet another ""craft"" book that is more personal reflection and/or memoir than actual instruction."
2,"If you read one Kent book, This ISN'T it!","I love the Bolitho series and have reread them all several times, Kent has not proved able to handle the transition from officer/captain to flag rank. Too dark, not enough action, what happen to the brillance of ""To Glory We Steer"" and others of the earlier books."
2,Too much love and hero-worshipping,Not by far as exciting as the earlier books in the Bolitho series. The delicate balance between personal affaires of our main character on the one end and the tremendously detailed action scenes on the other is lost. There are far too many sentimental bits and too much hero-worshipping stuff in this book. Kent is a bit off course in my opinion.
3,Toward the Unknown,"This very interesting book, marvelously writen by Tri Thong Dang brought me a deep understanding about the oriental aspect of the martial arts; as today we all look for self defense 0nly, some spiritual aspects were lost nowadays.Thw words of this book, bring me back to the days when we care about Master and disciple dialogues; and made me take the dust from my old I Ching book.One of the most interesting part of this volume is exactly that - each chapter starts with an I ching hexagram. And if you are clever enough, you'll relate all the history with the symbols.It's not the best book I read, but it worth it; I read it all in one afternoon."
3,"Before Buying ""VENI, VIDI, VICI,"" Buy ""AMO AMAS AMAT & MORE.""","This is simply follow-up of ""AMO AMAS AMAT & MORE."" If you are not familar with Latin phrases, you would be disappointed with this book, since there are many phrases which are not covered in this book, and are covered in ""AMO AMAS AMAT & MORE.""I like the Hardcover edition of ""AMO AMAS AMAT & MORE"" instead of paperback, as the paperback covers are simply easy to be damaged. You can find the hadcover edition of ""AMO AMAS AMAT & MORE"" @ Amazon Market Place ..... less than $1!!! for Good Used copies w/ Dustjacket. I paid only 69 cents + shipping for a very good used copy (hardcover w/dustjacket), while I paid $3.94 + shipping for a used paperback copy of ""VENI, VIDI, VICI."""
3,Not as practical as I'd hoped...,"While this is an interesting book, it's not as practical as I'd hoped. I was looking for a resource for finding very common Latin phrases - the kind we all hear and then nod as if we really know what they mean! This book had a lot of phrases, but most of them I'd never hear or use, and when I looked for common ones, they weren't there. I probably should have read the reviews more carefully before I bought it!"
3,Not for the serious,A fairly good collection of Latin proverbs but it assumes that you need a modern day (i.e. simplistic) translation. It does include the literal translation in most cases but I did not like having to scan the paragraph below the phrase for it. I'm also curious how an negative admonition to Rush Limbaugh fits into such a book. Methinks I can determine what political affiliation the author or editor claims and that's too bad. I'll be looking for something else that meets my expectations of such a serious subject.
5,A remarkable book for me,"I took Latin class in my senior year of high school. I was the only student in the class and my Latin teacher was one of my favorite teacher. I got this book from him for Latin award. He inspires me a lot and I really enjoy study this book. It is a very useful book for Latin studay if you really have strong amibition. "" Vini vidi vici"" is one of my favorite phrase now."
4,riser bars for comfort,"These bars are steel so they are a bit heaver than the Aluminum bars I replaced. For the price who cares! the point was a taller bar and they are, they are also wide, you can trim if needed but plenty of material to work with. Great bargain."
1,Amazon has the wrong credits for this movie on their site.,"The ""Going Postal"" with Chris Alessi and Chris Caron is a very cute student film written and directed by Beverly Chase. It won Best Short Comedy at the New Hampshire Film Festival. It has no dark side. It is the story of two friends and their quest and travels to purchase an old postal jeep. Amazon has the wrong information about the movie they are selling called ""Going Postal""."
1,Incorrect purchase,"Once again, my mistake, I bought the wrong movie. I wanted Terry Prachett's GOING POSTAL, not this ridiculous piece of crap."
1,"This is not, I repeat not a Terry Pratchett movie.","This is not Terry Pratchett's Going postal that aired on the BBC, this is a movie with Brad Garrett from Everybody Loves Raymond. That being said I have not seen this movie and am only giving this a one because it pops up in the terry prachett search. Hope this was helpful."
1,"As others, this is NOT the Terry Pratchett one","This DVD came up as a recommendation when I was ordering other Pratchett DVD's, so I assumed, wrongly, that it was the recent BBC version of Terry's book finally released here and ordered it. I am very upset that I was wrong. Whoever or whatever is making the recommendations needs to get a clue. This movie is being returned unopened."
4,OMG! I WISH I HAVE IT!!!!!,I don't have it but I played it my friends house and wish I did.This fame has so much more charaters and outfits! This is the best game ever!!!!!!
1,WHAT HAPPENED!!!,I thoroughly enjoyed the first version of this karaoke game and was told that you would be able to buy a song expanision disc.Now instead of getting that I see that a vol.2 will be made seems like a way to make you send more money when all I want is more songs. WHAT HAPPEN TO THE EXPANDSION DISC???
3,"Wish it were more ""user friendly""","Both I and my wife love the DDR style games and we thought this would be a fun blast for parties etc. My wife is a trained vocalist so I knew she would rock on gameplay, but heck, even I used to sing in a variety of garage bands. These games rely STRICTLY on pitch variations...which really stinks for people like me who can't seem to hit some of the high notes (or sustain them). It was very disappointing to not be able to pass a song by ""singing"" the correct words with the correct timing....most songs you can simply ""hum""out loud and pass the stages.I was looking for a simple fun party game, not vocal training. while my wife still loves them I can't recommend them for everyone. Unless you have a high pitched/tone vocal style or have a musical background you will probably be disappointed."
5,To the below reviewer:,This IS an expansion disc. The new songs are:Baby One More TimeBorn To Be WildCryDrift AwayEvery Breath You TakeFriends In Low PlacesGenie in a BottleHeartbreak HotelHere Without YouHot StuffI Believe in a Thing Called LoveI Hate Everything About YouI Will SurviveI'll Make Love to YouI'm With YouIrresistibleIt's My LifeI've Got You Under My SkinJesse's GirlLady MarmaladeLet's Get It OnMiss YouMy GirlPapa Don't PreachPerfectRich GirlRock and Roll All NightSittin' on the Dock of the BaySweet Home AlabamaThe First Cut is the DeepestThe JokerToxicVirtual InsanityWe Are FamilyWhite Flag
3,"Not as good as the more recent versions, but fun","If you have played the most recent version of Karaoke Revolution prior to buying this game, you might be disappointed. There are far less features in this version.However, it still is fun."
3,If I had to choose...,"This version is my least favorite only because I didn't think the song list was all that impressive. I have Volume 3 and Karaoke Party as well, and found the song lists to be a little more varied and more fun to sing. This version is worth having if you have a lot of parties and want to add it to your collection, but if you had to choose between getting this version and any of the other versions, I'd pass on this."
2,beware of cheesy singers,this game has some of the best songs ever but they pick some of the cheesiest singers ever! i quit playing until i found out you can turn the vocals down. that made it a lot better but still on some songs it goes way too high or way too low. so if you're a big music memorizer and listener like me think about it before buying this game
3,Not as fun as Karaoke Revolution Party,"This game has new songs, but the graphics aren't nearly as good as Karaoke Party, less things to unlock, and you can't create your character. It's still loads of fun, but we enjoy Karaoke Revolution Party much more."
5,A must have!,"Way too cool, full of hard rocking tunes!The sound quality is as if it was recorded in the studio, the songs are all great and two great cover tunes; 'Hold Her Tight'(Osmonds) and 'Karn Evil 9'. I have not taken this off my CD player since I have gotten it, and will it will stay there until I get the Flying Dog import I am ordering."
1,Bad sound,"The songs on this CD are available on other CDs (Groovin High on Savoy, eg) with much better sound quality. Dont buy this."
1,Terrible...,"Possibly one of dizzy's most poorly recorded collections. The whole album is very muffled. After one listen, this album moved from my record collection to the used cd store. I hate to say this about one of dizzy's albums, but this one just stinks. Don't waste your money."
5,Erector Design Advance Set for 12 year old boy,"I gave it 5 stars because this was a wonderful gift for my 12 year old son. He loves building things and this was perfect. He has built other erector sets and loves them!!! Delivered on time, in great condition. This met all my expectations.....and of course it met all my son's expectations! Thank you."
5,mom,my mom love this show i would recommend this to anyone hope mom likes this gift came faster than the date said
4,Good Clean Series,"Little House on the Prairie is a good clean series, very watchable. Like anything on planet earth, there are occasional things I might have to explain to my children if I had any, but these are about as clean as you get. And they are entertaining. They take place in earlier America, pioneer times. They reflect community spirit, cooperation, family, honesty and to some extent christian values."
5,Great for Family time...,This is a great way to spend time with your kids. I have children who range in age from 12 to 3 years and we all enjoy this series. My children love to watch something that I enjoyed as a child growing up.
5,Little Half Pint,"I was one year old when this show came out. What I don't get is how can those fleas survive in baking in the cornmeal? Why do most Guest stars have 1 child anyway,that makes me mad! I thought the 1800s were big families time. I would love to get all the sets,when I get more money,if the money cop[my mother] wants me to."
1,Unwatchable episode,ASIN:B00009QG5O Little House on the Prairie - The Complete Season 1]]One of the episodes only played for five minutes and then quit playing!!!
3,Good old series but comes with a message,"My girlfriend likes this series and I used to like it very much when I was a kid. I think the cast of characters are cute and the stories are usually interesting. The only thing to watch for is the very obvious christian message (or should I say propaganda) and very old school family values (women cook and raise the children at home men do the hardwork, they all go to church on sundays etc) If you are ok with all this or you don't care there is no problem; otherwise you have to be careful especially letting your children watch these series if you don't necessarily agree with the message."
2,Little House - Complete Season 1,"I don't want to waste everyone's time here just like to mention that there are a lot of deleted scenes from this series. A VHS version I have of ""Town Party, Country Party"" contains the full length unedited episode but the DVD version does not. A number of episodes in this Season 1 package have been edited. Very disappointing.... Many of theses episodes have just aired recently on cable in their full length unedited form... Why edit them for U.S. distribution? Do a web search on Little House deleted scenes."
5,Tim Reyes@Good Person,"I Love This Show. I Am Planning To Get Little House On The Prairie Season 1,2,and 3 for Christmas.These Episodes From Season 1 ran from September 11, 1974 to May 7, 1975.These are the episodes from it's 1974-1975 Season 1. Here are the episodes:1. A Harvest Of Friends2. Country Girls3. 100 Mile Walk4. Mr.Edward's Homecoming5. The Love Of Johnny Johnson6. If I Should Wake Before I Die7. Town Party,Country Party8.

Plague18. Circus Man19. Child Of Pain20. Money Crop21. Survival22. To See The World23. Founders DayThese Episodes Are Grrreat!"
2,Where is the closed-captioning?,"Where is the closed-captioning at? I can't believe that NBC would allow this to be released on disc without captioning. As some of us fans start aging our hearing may not be so good anymore. Since I've loved and watched the show for years I really don't need to hear all of the lines anyway. The extra features were a little shoddy. The quiz section does not work at all, and the family album shows cast members who were from a long way off yet. I thought the visual quality of the episodes were a lot better than the ones shown on television today."
5,Little House on the Prairie - Season 1,"Little House on the Prairie is family entertainment at its best. It is a show your children can actually learn values from. Set in the early western days, when life was a lot harder, and people had to rely on each other for many of their needs and protection. Good family entertainment!"
4,Who doesn't like LHOTP?,In this season: The Ingalls move to Walnut Grove. Laura and Mary start school and so happily (snort) get to meet Nellie. Charles goes to Mancado he see's Mr. Edwards and brings him back to Walnut Grove. He instantly falls in love with Grace Snider. Ms. Beadle sprains her ankle and Caroline becomes the substitute. Carolyn gives birth to Charles Jr. But Laura feels left out and won't pray for him. When he dies she feels responsible and runs away to the mountains. Nels and Harriet get into a big fight and split up. And Founders day comes up and the Oleson's and Ingalls find out that thier family's have very competitive natures.Specail Features:Interactive Full Motion MenuCharacter ProfilesThe Ingalls Photo AlbumLittle house Season 1 Quiz
4,Little House - No Opening Credits,"I just purchased the Little House on the Prairie Seasons 1 & 2 on DVD (local store accidentaly released it a week early) and the picture and sound quality are excellent, the only complaint here is that they do not include the opening credits. Each DVD contains 4 episodes and only the first episode on each disc has the opening credits, the box says ""uncut and in their original form"" but how can this be when you don't have the opening title. To me, they just don't seem complete."
2,"""Poor Quility""",I ordered two seasons of little house on the Prairie from the seller. The seller said they were never opened still sealed they were a good price so I ordered them both 1 and 2 the first season disc one was broke keeps pauseing during the show same into second disc until disc 3 the rest are ok. But I am not a happy camper I waited a long time for them and then that's what I had to deal with. Not good. Not sure I would order from them again you should know your merchandise good before you sell it.
3,Beware of less than stellar transfers!,"I would like to warn anybody out there that Little House on the Praire seasons 1 and 2 are a bit dissapointing as far as quality goes. First of all, the opening theme credits, which listed different cast members and guest stars for each episode are not included! One version of the opening credits is used on the first episode of each disc. So that many actors surch as Victor French, Kevin Hagen, and special guest stars Ernest Borgnine, and Patricia Neal get no screen credits on these dvds. Secondly, these are not new transfers struck from original camera negatives, but rather existing TV transfers that have been electronically enhanced. So they look better than they did, but not up to dvd standards. And lastly they have been time compressed. That is to say, slightly sped up so that the soundtracks have a slightly higher pitch. Most fans will be happy with the quality, but purists should beware!"
2,Great series...Poor release.,"This series deserves a better release than this one. I was very excited to see that this series was finally released...until I got it home. The picture quality was not up to DVD standards. Most of them look just okay, a few of them were dreadful. I haven't had any of the sound problems that I've read about on here. But the worst part is NO OPENING CREDITS?! what were they thinking? I want to see the pre-show teasers as I did in the 70s and I want to see the opening credits as I did in the 70s...ON EVERY EPISODE. Nice try, better luck next time...Michael Landon wouldn't have stood for this if he were still here."
5,Wholesome Family Entertainment!,What a blessing to actually be able to sit down as a family and watch tv! There is so much garbage on television these days and we are refreshed to be able to pop in these wonderful classics! My kids are seeing great values enforced and enjoy each show!
4,No Captions for the Hard of Hearing,"The product is all it's advertised to be but note that if you're buying it for an elderly person who's hard of hearing, as I was, there are no captions. Otherwise, it's fine."
5,A teenager's review,"I just LOVE Little House on the Prairie!!!!!!!!! it has got to be the best show that was ever on TV! Season one is just terrific! Hundred Mile Walk was SOOOOOOOOO good! also A Harvest of Friends and Country Girls were excellent!! Most of the 24 episodes are just super, but there were a couple I could have done without: namely The Love of Johnny Johnson, in witch Laura (who looks like she's about 5 years old) falls in love with 15 year old Johnny Johnson; and The Lord is My Shepard pt. II, in which Laura meets some angel at the top of a mountain. Other than that, this first season is soo good and anyone age 5-500 should watch!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Undeniably the best season of LHOTP,Is season one. Melissa Gilbert is dynamite as Half-pint (Laura Ingalls). The show at this early stage is full ofgood plotted stories with fine morals. The show is very far from the soap it would become starting with season four (with elements like Mary's blindness).
4,In Good condition,The product I purchased arrived in good condition. In fact it arrived earlier than scheduled. This item is not available in my own country and therefore I am pleased to have it. Thanks
1,I can't believe this!!!,"It is amazing to me what these so called video companies release. These dvds are so time compressed that Michael Landon sounds like Mickey mouse. The transfers are old ans spotty to say the least. They never should have put 6 episodes on a one sided disc. DVD started out as a film historian's dream of preserving all the classics forever. Like every thing else these days commercialism ruined it. Just think what you are getting ..., 19 hours of video! Wow wee. It is all wrong. Just junk. Maybe they will get seasons 3 and 4 right. I will wait"
4,Just like I remember,"I gave this DVD set to my daughter for her 9th birthday. I remember watching the show every week and loving it! It's a little more melodramatic than I remember, but my daughter likes the shows. It's a great alternative to the junk that is on T.V. now."
5,Christmas Gift,"Purchased this for my mother as a Christmas gift. She loved it. She's loved the series since it first aired.So this was a great nostalgic gift for her.She really liked the extra special features too.If you or someone you know likes this series, this would be a great gift for them!"
3,Beginning is screechy 2nd time around,"I love Little House on the Prairie. However, I requested and received a replacement for this first season package because the beginning of each dvd had a terribly ear-piercing, screeching sound and one of the dvds skipped a lot; other than that I really enjoyed the shows. As soon as I received the replacement shipment, I checked and found the same terrible screeching at the beginning of each dvd; I have not watched the entire shows on this replacement package; I hope they are in good shape and will make sure volume is way down when I insert the dvd."
5,Little house on the prairie,"AWESOME, I am collecting every season as I want to have them all for my Grandchildren, as I fear that one day they may take the repeats of the TV channels, which would be a terrible waste."
5,"5 stars for the story, not the production","This was the best purchace I have made in a long time. My children 6 and 8 years old are always excited about watching the next episode. I forgot how great this series was. It is fun to watch it with them and see them often on the edge of their seats screaming ""hurry, hurry"" or ""don't do it Laura!""Adventure, comedy, tragedy, friends, enimies, morals, conflicts, teamwork, family, trust, truth, lies.The picture quality is not great but not that bad for a 1970s TV series. We have not got to season 4 yet and I hear that one is bad.The only down side is that my daughter keeps whistling the theme song. Last weekend she did it all day long.Forget about digital quality, HiDef, surround sound, and ""DVD extras"" and watch some great drama."
3,LITTLE HOUSE season 1 and 2,"I bought season 1 and 2 when they first came out. They were pretty good except some nimrod at the company decided to cut out the end credits from the episodes. Thanks alot, guys. thats why I didnt buy any more of the sets."
5,"Little House on the Prairie, Season I","The price was right, it was easy to order, and it was delivered within the time frame stated.Will continue to order from Amazon.com"
5,Great TV,"great story, great family values, great entertainment, my children love this TV series, this is a much better choice from the slop on modern cable television"
4,Good family entertainment,"This is one of the original family stories that carrties excitment and teaches values. Mr. Edwards is introduced as a frined of the family, with Ma being doubtful if he can be trusted. Of course, he has problems with the girls, but has his unique style of dealing with it. It's better of Ma didn't know how he did it!Great memories and a pleasant time of relief from modern crime and reality shows."
5,Listen up!!!,"Think about the wilderness. I'm talking about the trees, the rocks, the sun, and the soil under your feet. Do you like to smell the fresh flowers when they pop up in the spring, or die in the fall. Either way, you would be happy watching this show. This film includes all the seasons. If you have a quiet movie night with your family, or a loud one, this is perfect for you!!! Everyone loves this show, do you want to be left out??? Of course not"
2,What A Shame....,"I'm serious - I could have done a better job transferring VHS tapes to DVD on my home computer than this! These are hands down the WORST video and audio mastering jobs I've ever seen.The bitrate on these DVD's is horrible, the sound quality is horrible; the video is seriously on par with an average VHS tape. I don't know WHAT they did to the audio - but Charles sounds like Mickey Mouse half the time it's mixed so badly.The only way some of these reviewers could be remotely happy about these is if they are so emotionally attached to the show that they are blinded to the reality of how shoddily and quickly these were thrown together.The only thing that saves this is that the shows are so great. What a shame they were ""re-mastered"" by people who obviously don't give one ounce of care into what they're doing other than churning these out as quickly as possible."
1,Buy at your own risk,Image quality ok considering the age. But the sound is far from ok and not surround. A big deception and it was not even advertised on the description. Be careful not to get fooled. For collectors who REALLY wants it badly and nobody else. I returned mine since it was deffective and i'm having a hard time getting refunded. Beware!
4,"good quality, but not intuitive","the phone is a good quality, but the logic behind the controls and menu scrolls (previous callers and addresses) is a bit awkward"
4,Happy but,"The phone does everything well that it is capable of doing but not having speed dial feature it is difficult to use a phone card feature, possible but difficult."
2,Don't go far from the base...,"I had high expectations but they were not met. I could not go far from the room that had the base without the phone quality dropping like a stone. I liked the speaker-phone feature but for the life of my I could not figure out how to turn it off without hanging up. Finally, everyone I called said I sounded like I was talking on a speaker phone, whether I was or not."
2,Totally disposable,"I was happy with this phone for a while after I got it but it went wrong too quickly. First, the antenna broke off. We don't have kids and are only two adults in the house. The phone was not subject to any kind of abuse. We like to take care of our things. But the antenna was just not very sturdy. We also take care to avoid battery memory issues by not charging it constantly, but rather letting it drain the power before placing it to charge on the cradle. Still, the battery life decayed very quickly. Right now, after only 5 years of gentle and casual use (we use our cell phone much more than the house phone) it will not hold a charge at all. Even worse, a new battery made no difference. And the battery replacement is too expensive just to try it out. I am very disappointed in this phone. I don't expect it to last forever, but certainly more than 5 years."
3,Caller ID doesn't always show up,"I have had this phone for almost two years now and cannot agree with most of the reviews here. It is a decent phone and is still reliable but I have to completely concur with Walt Johnson ""planetwalt"" especially on these two points: Voice Enhancer is useless and caller ID information doesn't always show up. I will sometimes be waiting for caller ID info to appear, go to another cordless phone I have in my house, and it is displayed on the old phone but not this Panasonic. Also, the voice quality, although MUCH better than the GE model 25825 I own, is not as great as everyone is saying - good but not great. Overall, I would look for something a little better."
3,"Excellent reception, but...","As I've repeatedly had problems with the reception and clarity of previous phones, I purchased this Panasonic based on its claim of digital clarity. The reception and clarity is fantastic -- couldn't expect better. But there are two major drawbacks that prevent a five-star rating: there is no speed-dial feature -- only a directory-of-sorts of past calls; and the ""on"" and ""off"" buttons are small and not easily located amongst the other buttons...you have to look to see what you're hitting. After a while, this gets very old."
2,"Die, Mute button, die.","This phone is not all smiles and laughing and gumdrops: the mute button makes me crazy. Oh, the phone is all ""la la la I love its range and clarity,"" as other users report, but my face hits the Mute button as I talk. Unaware that my calls are muted, conversations break down into two kids with crappy walkie-talkies: ""Hello? Hey, you there? Hello?!""I don't suffer from Fat Face, nor am I mashing the handset to my cheek. The phone is otherwise excellent.But I'm going to destroy mine."
3,volume difficulty,"I like the concept. A base phone and additionals, all cordless. 2 things annoy me. The volume cannot be high enough even after getting the most bars possible on the handset. Plus, every time you look at the dial it tells you how many ""missed"" calls. They are not all missed. They are just calls that have come in answered or not."
2,Handset sound volume issues during conversation.,"I really wanted to like this phone from all the good reviews, but received one with issues, returned it and received another with the same issues; so it must be the phone model.The below items do not involve using the handset speakerphone feature which requires a ""wait for you"" ""wait for me"" behavior; just normal handset.-When you first answer an incoming call, you usually have to wait a few seconds for the phone to make available 2 way converstion; otherwise, you can say hello and the caller can't hear you and you can't hear them.-During a call using normal handset, background noise and even regular conversation can cause the phone to block the volume of the caller as though you are using the speakerphone feature when you're actually not. After a few seconds the volume will become audible again. This issue causes bits and pieces of the conversation to go unheard. This happens more on long distance calls than on local calls."
3,I'd like to ask Mr. Burk for a recommendation,"I checked out ""Accessible Housing"" from the library and found it quite informative, but then again, I am not an architect. Would you recommend a book on this subject that is better to read?Thanks!"
2,BoxWave Kindle Fire BodySuit,"I have been very pleased with most every purchase I have made through Amazon. However, this product is a bit disappointing. It fits well but every bit of lint or dust in the air clings to it and after a short time, it is dirty and feels gritty. It is impossible to keep clean."
4,Nice Case - Bad Amazon Add,Nice simple case that does what it says. Fits perfect for the Fire. All necessay ports/buttons accessible. My Fire tended to slip when carried. Now it does not. Read tha Amazon add carefully and DO NOT order non-Kindle items from your Fire without taking the tome to read everything on the page.
2,"it does not fit my 8.9"" kindle fire hd","this item was included at no extra cost when i bought a capacitive stylus, so i am not out any money.i found no information about the physical size of the bodysuit on any of the web pages when i was ordering it and the stylus, and since i had recently bought an 8.9"" kindle fire hd and several accessories, i assumed that amazon's cookies would know that and ""weed out"" anything that was not compatible with its size.unfortunately the bodysuit that was delivered with the stylus was for a 7"" device.it does not fit my kindle, but it seems to be a quality product.if it comes in the larger size i would be interested in buying one for my 8.9"" kindle fire hd."
4,Bodysuit did the job,I was unsure of this gel skin case but it was part of a special so I ordered it. My son loves this one more than the leather portfolio I also purchased. I only wish this came in a portfolio like cover to protect the screen.
3,Fits well,"This item came free with the purchase of a stylus, so I can't complain, but it was scratched on the outside as if it had been used and returned. Other than that it fits well and looks good."
1,Does not fit Fire HD,"I wish it was clearer that this case does not fit the Kindle Fire HD. It might fit the regular Kindle Fire, I am not sure as I have the Fire HD model. Unfortunate this is not mentioned anywhere on the product page. Until now, that is!"
5,Keeps the sleek profile of the Kindle Fire,"I really liked the thin feel of the Kindle Fire, but I wanted to protect it. This little slip-on protects the Kindle and makes it a little more colorful. I love the way the light shines through it somewhat, making a glowing blue frame around the Kindle Fire. It also gives it a little more grip when I set it down somewhere. I bought a padded zippered case to protect the Kindle in my purse. The combination is exactly what I hoped it would be."
5,Perfect lightweight cover,"No regrets buying this product. Inexpensive, very light weight, protects the Kindle and grippy enough for a better feel when holding the Kindle. I also like the color. Mine is mostly blue with hints of purple depending on how the light shines on it."
5,Exactly What I as Looking For!,This is exactly what I wanted. It was a perfect fit. Arrived faster than they quoted. I would recommend this to anyone!
1,not worth it,"terrible advertising, nowhere does it state that the legs are wider than the chair seat, it doesn't fit in our tub because the legs come out to wide. a big mistake"
1,Drivel,"This book is complete and utter garbage of the lowest degree. Zolar tosses in a few names of Greek astrologists along with some pseudo-alchemical/mystical philosophy, adds dense text, and claims to have a legitimate book on ""ancient and forbidden knowledge."" Thank the publishing industry for putting it out of print."
1,Missing Parts,The seat arrived in a timely manner. It also arrived without a back like the image shows. I live in a mobie home and it would not sit flat in the tub. Even when I shortened the legs they hit the radus of the tub. I couldn't use it at all.
1,Misleading Picture,"This seat does not come with a back, even though the picture has a back AND no where on the product listing does it say that there is no back for this chair. Thank you for making me return the chair to purchase a new one due to misinformation and misleading advertising."
3,So what the Bomb!,I'm really loving these disc! Like the two abaove writer there could have been some of thesee tracks left off of these albums! I some what undertand why they name this collection Hip Hop History but where are the other songs we need to hear at. You didn't get the clearance to use the sonsg and just pit B.S. Tracks on it??? I bought this at Virgin Record store for 9.99! Way worth my money! Don't play 30 to 50 Bucks for this! I just know all I'm going to do is put all the classic tracks on my Ipod and jam out! If you can buy this cd for 15 Bucks and under it's worth! It's 3 disc which is hot!
2,I'm having a read problem with this book,"Jackie may have done some great things to keep her marriage together, but after reading this book, I wonder why she put up with Jack. It is really disgusting to read how he acted while many important events were going on. I've lost all respect for him and I can't feel sorry for her for putting up with it.What a poor excuse for a leader JFK was. It was all smoke and mirrors and we didn't know it."
2,Boring,"Overall the book was boring. Once again, as is becoming the case with many Kennedy inspired books, the information contained is not shocking or even new to reader, despite what the author promises. This "" missing history"" can be found in many other books written about this self-destructive family. Indeed I read not one thing that captured my attention as having never been mentioned before. Not only that, but the book seemed to contain more information about Jack than about Jackie. Perhaps the title should have been Jack Kennedy: The Missing History of the Kennedy Years."
3,Jack's sexcapades.,"I felt the book relied too heavily on what the author imagined what Jackie was thinking, or how she felt. How could the author know? I was less inclined to become absorbed in the books portryal of JFK because the author made JFK out to be a real cad. Recent information has a different approach to JFK. Yes, yes, yes- we know that JFK enjoyed in some extramarital affairs- but I don't believe to the extent to which the author describes.Some new stuff, but too heavily on the bedroom- which Jackie had always said was off limits."
1,A misleading book title...?,"The author could have steered her manifest talent away from an ongoing, relentless and often non-contributory attack of the late president's dalliances, and rather used the same space - or possibly less - to write a book about Mrs. Kennedy. Maybe it's a ""chick-book"" that I should have not invaded (it was given to me by my voracious-reading love after she read it, albeit with some discomfort) but I found myself quite put off by some of her dubious inclusions - e.g. ""...JFK should have known the moral tenor of xxxxx, as she was introduced to him by Frank Sinatra..."" (words not exact). Why the shot at Sinatra? This type of writing went on throughout the pages. I would not recommend the book, nor offer the one we own to a friend, as is our custom with most books we buy."
1,Bias.Bias.Bias,"According to Leaming, Mrs Kennedy was a major depressive without a scintilla of healthy self esteem. Her impression belies the fact that she raised two wonderful and talented children. I would love to hear Caroline's appraisal of this book. Mrs Kennedy was extremely intelligent,poised and introverted While the author may at times mention something admirable about her subject,but when she gets her breath, she manages to denigrate the positive, find something negative and attribute it to Mrs. Kennedy's poor self esteem. Frankly I found the book tiresome and was glad that I hadn't bought it. Public libraries are great!!"
2,Boring,"If I wanted to read a blow by blow of JFK's most notable presidential descisions, then I would read a book strictly about his presidency. The book is entitled ""Mrs. Kennedy..."" yet she takes the backburner. I also do not grasp how a book which was supposed to focus less on this particular era in Jackie's life (""America's Queen: The Life of Jaqueline Kennedy Onassis"" by Sarah Bradford) gave the most important details. In short, the title of this book is false advertising at its worst and the author might have done well to spend less time trying to read minds. The most repeated themes of this book are contridictory and the writer's voice is projected too loudly."
1,Too Speculative,"First of all, this book needs a really, really good editor. I can't tell you how often themes are repeated and repeated to the point where it seems like the reader is assumed to be dumb because they aren't expected to remember an important point already made. Secondly, the exchange of a few letters - none of which are quoted from Jackie AT ALL - forms the premise of this ""great"" relationship between her and Harold Macmillan. Quite a stretch. But the real problem with this book is that there is total speculation about what Jackie is thinking and feeling. CHeckng the footnotes indicates nothing at all about where the author is getting all this. It's all interesting but its more like a pyschological fiction than a genuine piece of ""missing history."" All that said - the speculation is interesting and well-thought out by the author - its just that this is about the author's feelings and thoughts, not Jackie's."
2,Unfulfilled promise,"I read this book hoping it would be useful in a class paper I am writing on Mrs. Kennedy's White House Restoration, to provide a little background to her work. I was sorely disappointed. The crown jewel of her time in the White House was given a few pages. Stories of Jack's infidelities fill the book, and Jackie's responses to them. But little is said of Jackie's work, only of what she did in response or in aid of Jack's policys and behaviors. If you are looking for a Biography of Mrs. Kennedy, I'd suggest another one."
1,Where's my Nano adaptor?,"Beware this does not come with an adaptor for a Nano. (And it is NOT noted in the technical details.) The manufacturer says it will provide one, but 6 weeks after I requested one via the Web, I've yet to get it. Worse yet, customer service has been totally unresponsive. Negative stars for backing up their product."
5,Excellent all around,"This works great - both delivering iPod to my receiver and playing anything else I want wherever I want. Battery life is good. The control panel is odd - looks like a removeable remote, but isn't. My only problem is I can't listen to TV, but I think that is the fault of my receiver blocking digital audio in to Zone 2 line out, not the iBall."
1,Was great for 7 months then it stopped working.,"I loved my iBall. The sound quality and range was excellent for a relatively modest price. I say ""loved"" because after 7 months the product stopped working. Now I have to pay to ship the item back to the manufacturer in order to get it fixed or receive a replacement.To add insult to injury I found the customer service representative I spoke to on the phone rather rude and disinterested in my problem. He rattled through the warranty-return-address so quickly I could not write it down even after asking him repeatedly to speak more slowly. He demanded my contact information rather than asking politely for it without the use please's, thank you's and any apologies.I would recommend purchasing from a brand with higher quality and better customer service."
4,A terific product,"Four plus stars! Bought in New Zealand, so packing may be different, but the box DID include an adapter for the Nano, as well as six other iPod models. Oregon Scientific put a lot of thought into this device. The sound quality, in particularly the bass reponse, is very satisfactory. Being able to just pop the iBall wherever you wish, with no trailing cords, is just great. The dock for the iPod is weighty and has very non-skid pads. My only quibble is that, as far as I can tell, you can adjust the volume only by the controls on the iBall."
2,Nice for the first 2 months,"The iBall works great and has a strong signal. However, when the batteries on mine completely drained it never restarted ever again. Usually when it got low on juice I'd recharge. Well, once I was out of town and it drained completely never to be power back on again, regardless of how long I left the DC plug in the unit."
1,Light Speed Super Pack,"Light Speed Algebra bundle Pack Starring Light Speed (2010) will be cheaper than buying these DVDs individually, think it over before you invest the money individually, they are very good products, so you will end up in buying all of them."
4,Silky smooth texas country,"I've been listening to Max Stalling on my local radio station (KHYI) for a couple of years now and finally bought his first album. He has a voice that sounds like it came straight from a campfire signalong, and does plenty of Texas name-dropping to leave no doubt as to the geography that inspires his work. There are a few throwaway songs on this CD but I will forgive him for those, especially when there are songs as brilliant as ""Mockingbird."""
1,Worst TX music CD of 1999,"I bought a lot of Texas country music CD's last year and this was by far the worst. Mr Stalling has a voice like a Phil Ochs with no range, the songwriting is OK but I just couldnt take his amatuerish and annoying vocals."
3,Not what I had hoped,"These treats work better than nothing at all I suppose but we still have some yellowing. Previously, I had some treats that were a meaty flavor and the female dog liked them better than these. I have a male who will eat anything. However, I am told it is only the female dogs that cause the yellowing of grass. That said, I have not researched this. . ."
2,"I was interested at first, but...","The pace of this book is so slow - I suppose there is richness there that I am simply unable to mine properly - and also, I had trouble finding any characters to admire. Possibly they would have stepped forward eventually, but I didn't have the patience for it - sorry."
2,Early promise just did not deliver . . .,"The opening chapter of a subservient Muslim wife waking in the early hours of the morning to put her gallivanting husband to bed holds tremendous promise for a wonderful book. Sadly the ""epic"" does not deliver if you like your fiction to be pacy and exciting. I valiantly plodded along since it is an easy enough read but found the book got bogged down by long passages of philosophy of life, love and marriage, none of which endeared me to this family who sin with impunity whilst their daily mantra is calling on ""the only God"". Their lives are tedious and their secrets and sins become repetitious and are just not interesting enough to recommend this book anywhere near to what I consider a 5 star read"
3,Long but interesting,"So far it is very intriguing but it is very intense. Therefore, I haven't finished reading it."
5,A lover of dickens and trollope,"I was mesmerized by this family living under British rule. It is evident that Mahfouz was much influenced by 19th century British writers, but he applies this influence with a delicate touch. I was a member of this family by the middle of the first volume, and would happily still be following them from then until the present day.The people in these volumes are solid,very much for real.The author grabs his readers and holds them facinated by a great story of a time and culture few of us know much about."
5,Greatest Arabian novel ever,"Greatest Arabian novel ever by the real founder of modern Arab literature , every character and every detail is captivatingStrongly recommend"
5,Great product!,"Found the strips to be extremely accurate and not too expensive. If your cycle is irregular you may need to test for two to three weeks and the smaller packs in the drug stores run about $15 for 7 tests. Be sure to read the instructions carefully. Other products say to test first thing in the morning, but the strips say the LH surge happens around 2pm."
2,Never got a positive result,"I have been using these for 4 months and I have yet to see a positive result. The closest I've come to a positive result was when 2 lines appeared! I tested multiple times that day and my line never got darker than the control line but apparently the presence of 2 lines was the sign that I was ovulating because we got pregnant.So the test results were negative all week, but I definitely ovulated! I've rated 2 stars for the very minute off chance I missed the hormone surge, but like I said I tested all day, all week.Also, no instructions came with them so I had to look them up online and ask around."
1,never show positive results,I don't recommend this product. About 1/3 of them didn't work (no test results). It's hard to tell when you use one of those faulty ovulation tests on the ovulation date.
4,A Good Place to Start,I bought this book almost a year ago and loved it. I was considering and I am now going into business for myself and found this book useful. It is a good place to start for women who are considering going into business for themselves. The case studies are good because it let's you know other women who are successfull went through the same thing you are as you start this journey. Plus it is very easy to read a big plus.
5,Great Info for Business Women,"I have really enjoyed this book. The information is notable and it contains lots of common sense advice that you may not have thought of to get your feet wet and be your own boss! Highly recommend this one for the smart, business women out there."
5,Pretty Beads,"I love Murano Millefiori beads, in earrings, bracelets and necklaces. These earrings are very pretty, and light-weight. I don't know what the secret is, but it doesn't matter what shade of green is in my outfit, these earrings pick up the hue! They are lovely and I love wearing them."
1,Waste of money,"This book is badly structured, verbose and chatty. A seasoned editor could have reduced it by at least 20 percent. More important, the book omits crucial features in FCP 3/DVDSP, such as using Markers to indicate Chapters. As a matter of fact, the subject of Chapters in DVDSP isn't even touched upon!Further, in spite of the title, the book is heavily biased to FCP, with just a few scant chapters on DVDSP.I'm very disappointed and consider this book a waste of money."
5,Fantastic!,I am a student who used this book for a school project. It felt it gave a very accurate review of what life was like in Andersonville Prison. If a person is doing a report on Andersonville they need to read this book. This book greatly helped my project!
5,A true diary,"When I was encouraged to read this book I saw it as a bore. However, upon embarking on this read, I could hardly put it down. I was intrigued on a major level. I've been to the old prison site three times and this book really sets you up to visualize the prison the way it was. The prison is all sad, however I was very disturbed by the way the north treated the fellow who was in charge of the prison during it prime. This was unmitigated revenge and spite."
3,ANDERSONVILLE DIARY,"I was all fired up to read this book, as I was always fashinated by the horrors of Andersonville, but after reading the same tragic events, over and over again by John Ransom, I think I got the point after the first three or four chapters...It was hell for sure, but a drawn out book..."
5,A gripping account of one of America's most shameful events.,One of the best books I have read. The account Mr. Ransom provides is detailed in the suffering incurred by the prisoners. I was amazed by the dedication to the cause by men facing such extreme circumstances. Such integrity and discipline is a credit to all American's as much as the conditions were a shame.
1,Not impressed,"I purchased the Helen of Troy SoftTouch Volumizing diffuser about a month ago. It claimed to fit most hairdryers, it did not fit the one I had purchased recently even though the hairdryer I have is quite small. Also, I found it was very cheaply made; it's thin plastic so I found it really impractical to use since when you trying to slip it onto a hairdryer, it is so thin, there is a fear that it may break. So I haven't used the diffuser for this reason."
4,An interesting intro to Japan,"""Japan,"" by Tamara L. Britton, is a basic book about the nation of Japan. It is richly illustrated with many photographs (both color and black-and-white). It includes maps, an index, a glossary, and other supplements. There is a chart of ""fast facts"" (ex. population, highest elevation, mining products, etc.) and a historic timeline.Topics covered include history, geography, plant and animal life, ethnic groups, the school system, government structure, theater traditions, and more. My only complaint is that the book should have included more on Japan's remarkable language and complex writing system. But that aside, it's a solid reference work."
1,WARNING - POOR QUALITY,"This edition claims 24 bit remastering but on listening it's clear that many if not all tracks have been recorded off an LP. You can hear the clicks and pops of an old vinyl pressing.Apparently a new version is now available from another label. I don't know about the source for that recording, but this is very poor considering its high price. Unfortunately the return date had elapsed before I listened to it, otherwise I would have returned to Amazon.In summary, the music is 5 stars but the recording is 1 star. No point in 24 bit remastering for a copy made from an old LP!"
4,ROCIO BANQUELLS- EL REGRESO,"DESPUES DE MUCHO TIEMPO DE ESTAR FUERA DE LOS ESCENARIOS, ROCIO BANQUELLS HA REGRESADO AL MEDIO GANANDO UN REALITY SHOW EN MEXICO, Y AHORA ESTAN A LA VENTA DISCOS CON SUS GRANDES EXITOS... ESTUPENDO PORQUE ELLA AUN CONSERVA ESA VOZ POTENTE... ESTE DISCO CONTIENE ALGUNOS TEMAS COMO ""DENTRO"" Y ""EN EL ALAMBRE"", CON LAS QUE HIZO UN GRAN CAMBIO EN LA TEMATICA DE SUS LETRAS Y SU MUSICA... BUEN DISCO..."
3,An Above Average Read,"This book covers many key factors of entering a lucid state of mind, however misses some key points and strategies for attaining lucidity. It tells most of the basics, but there are better books on the topic such as: Exploring the world of Lucid Dreaming by Stephen Laberge. Overall, I found this book helpful, but lacking."
4,Front Door,This is the beginning to a sequel of 4 however you dont' know this until later in the game. Storyline a little slow in being developed but good purchase.
5,It Works,This product does work. I rub it on my little dog every week or so and her dander seems to be neutralised.
4,fine book for day hikes only - no multiday itineraries,"Fine book as far as it goes, but if you're looking for multi-day itineraries, such as village to village walks, you won't find them within these covers. For a good selection of longer itineraries (as well as single day walks), try the excellent ""Walking in France"" by Gillian and John Souter."
5,Do you like what ya see??,"I liked Fat Pat's rapping style every since I first heard him with Lil'Keke on a screw tape. Every since then, he has been a pioneer in the southern rap industry. From the Southside Playaz album, Dead End Alliance (DEA) album, to Ghetto Dreams, I have appreciated his style. To bad violence had to take away another brother trying to speak the truth to his people and enlighten them on the wicked game of life. To everyone out there: ""Bounce, bounce to dis!!"""
4,representin tha south,"In my opionion Fat Pat, Tops Drop is one of the greatest rap albums yet. You could say, How could he it be a great album when he was an amateur, but in reality Pat was putting it down with Screw(a legend Down South known for slowing down albums so they can be better felt)years before the release of Tops Drop. Pat was a real rapper and poet, not some hollywood backstreet rapper. This album speaks the heart of an american playa and his struggles and stife,backed by an onslaught of tight beats put down by platinum soul. The album is better than Big Pun and little short of Tupac,RIP."
5,Ithink fat pats ballin down $outh.,ITs all about the $outh side give it up fore H-town & Corpus Christi Tx. on DA map.halla acha playa.JOSEPH ANTHONY FRANCIS.
5,"""a very good book""","This book is a blessing. If you are going through situations this book will show you how three ""sistahs in Christ"" made it through their trials. I recommmend this book to not just women but men too that are going through troubles in there life and need to see that they are not alone in their struggles."
4,Good Debut Novel,"This was a very good story for the first time out for this novelist. She brings you into the lives of Taylor, Pam and Yvonne. The story was very interesting and well put together. I could not put this book down. The ending was a little rushed I thought but nonetheless this book was worth my money. I like how God can touch you through a story."
3,Good,Good read not great but it is great for an rainy afternoon. the characters were well defined but some of the outcomes were very predictable.
4,A Sista Knows What To Do!,"The Regal Sisterhood Book Club selected this novel as book of the month for October 2010. We found this to be the best piece of work by the author Tiffany L. Warren. The storyline flowed well with a very realistic plot. The characters engaged the reader with heartfelt prayers and thought provoking dilema's. We highly recommend this novel for a women's ministry bookclub. It provides material for a great group discussion.

2,price to high,"Why is season 3 still over 30 dollars i bought season 1 an 2 at 27 dollars.season 6 is out now ,season 3 should be less then 25 dollars now,.although amazon ls all over the place with there priceing.if stores change there prices like amazon does,there would be customer outrage."
1,Keep on Dancing by Gary's Gang,"Beware of CD's coming out of Canada; they're notorious for REMAKING classic songs. these are songs by the original artists, but are NEW recordings done at a later time and are passed on as Original hits, but they are not!"
1,Questionable,I didnt buy this basically because your post is very confusing.Is it a 1G chip or a 2G chip???????
5,amazing and timeless,"just listen to this,i did at a late age and regret never having heard it before,i am responsive to most types of music,but this balfa brothers is truly endearing.havent stopped playing it for 6 mths now,many thanks to the balfa brothers especially dewey for giving us this wonderfull pleasure."
5,Tres bien!,This is an amazing collection of old-time cajun tunes. This unique tradition shines through authentic musicianship and heart-felt vocals. The danceable cadences will make the casual listener smile and give professional musicians a lesson in how this music was played generations ago.
5,Essential!,"No fan or student of Cajun music or folk/traditional music in general should be without this essential album. Every song here is a classic in the Cajun repertoire, and is presented in true Balfa Brothers form: outstanding! The liner notes include all the song lyrics in Cajun French and English. If you don't own this album, you really have no excuse. Buy it now!"
5,Heroes among us. A great read.,"Very inspiring. It is hard to stop and put it down. It was one of the fastest readings I have done in years because I did not want to stop. It is very neatly chaptered, so if you need to read and stop you usually can just read one story, and then come back later to start the next one."
5,Outstanding book!,I bought three of these as gifts for important men and young men in my life. The standards set by these great Americans are a model to anyone... male or female.
4,Mason's Clients are Never Guilty,"This is the 24th Perry Mason novel I've read (the 5th in the series), and it's Perry Mason at his best--or worst. For this is not the sanitized Perry Mason of television. The real Perry Mason routinely manipulates, suppresses, and, in this case, even plants evidence. Two eyewitnesses saw the bride kill her husband. She herself claims she did it. But she's Mason's client, so she couldn't possibly be guilty, right?"

1,disappointment,"loved the fragrance-but disappoointed that the scent did not lastpast 5 minutes even though I loaded on much more than I would normally wear. So, I returned it to the dept store from which I had purchased it and exchanged it for a new one. Same issue-the scent simply did not last and I considered myself foolish because I also had bought the lotion at no small expense."
2,Not loving it,"I really haven't been loving Lovely. It's beautifully packaged but the smell! I actually didn't even do a smell test because I thought that SJP would not put a foot wrong. Well, I was wrong. It is quite old-fashioned - like the scent that old women wear, it's musty as well. The bottle is really pretty but it just is too old-style for me. I'm going to use it now that I bought it but sometimes I get embarrassed and feel like saying - ""no I do not smell musty it's this perfume I'm determined to use up!"". Needless to say I've never received any compliments on the scent. I'm giving it two stars for the bottle design."
2,"Smells nice, but doesn't stay on","I love the smell of this perfume. However, it doesn't stay on. I have been wearing perfume for 18 years now and have used several different kinds without a problem. I was sold by SJP on this perfume when she appeared on Oprah. Loved it when I went to the counter at the mall to check it out. I have been using it for about 2 months now and it just doesn't last. About an hour after I put it on I (or my husband) can't smell it anymore. Trust me, I learned to apply it liberally and it still doesn't stay. Totally disappointed."
5,Luv it,"Quick arrival time , With Lovely being my favoriteScent I will continue to order here , thank u for yourgreat prices !!!!"
3,beautiful smell,It is a really pretty smell.I love it.I purchased one for my sister-in-law and one for myself.It's lovely
5,Lovely Rating,"This perfume truly is ""Lovely"" the scent is so clean, soft and refreshing! I get so many positive comments when I wear this lovely scent. I highly recommend this product."
3,It is lovely but poor staying power,"I absolutely love this fragrance, very delicate and light. However, the bottle I just purchased will sadly be the last. I just bought the Eau de Parfum but the scent just fades in no time.I guess anyone wanting a beautiful delicate fragrance that is not strong will love this.It really is 'Lovely'."
2,Not so great,"I admit I'm not a big perfume person. I usually like more fruity scents, but I was trying to find something more romantic for Valentine's Day. I bought this because it smelled nice on the tester strip. It was my mistake to not try it out on my wrist. Now that I have it, I think there's a strong soap-like smell, over-powering a musky floral scent."
1,Not so lovely...,"As some people before me said already, this scent isn't THAT lovely. I am a SJP-fan, and I was almost certain I would love the new perfume of this stylish lady.It isn't released yet in Holland, but I found a sample in Germany where it is already released. I was disappointed. The smell isn't bad, but it's isn't something I would like to smell like. It isn't lovely at all. It is too sporty. I expected something more flowery. The scent reminded me most of deodorant (cheap brands) or toilet-refreshener. So, although I am a SJP-fan, I wouldn't like to smell like her. A pity.My favourite perfumes are (as a comparison): Beyond Paradise (Estee Lauder), Curious (Britney Spears), Couture! (Moschino), Live (J.Lo), Tumulte (Christian LaCroix), several Escade Limited Edition Perfumes and Gucci Rush 2."
1,Didn't care for it,"This was a huge disappointment. I needed something that would last beyond 20 minutes, and this not only didn't last 5 minutes, but I didn't like the aroma and my husband couldn't smell it at ALL. I doused myself with it and got right in his face....NOTHING!I even tried layering another perfume on top of it, but it seemed to kill that perfume, too.I have tried this in stores and liked it, so I'm pretty sure the bottle I got was beyond it's shelf life. Unfortunately, I had destroyed all the packaging in the labor to get it open, or I'd have returned it immediately. Lessons learned. Try to open it gently (impossible), and KEEP everything. If you don't get a good bottle, put everything in a box and ship it back IMMEDIATELY.I think this is my first negative review."
2,"""Lovely"" Parfum Review",The parfum is an older ladies' scent. It is nice but not young or fresh. The price at Amazon.com is almost half so I didn't blow too much $$$. KIM
2,Fragrance,"I had sampled this perfume in a Macy's store and it was lovely, but the price expensive. I saw it on Amazon and ordered it. It wasn't the same fragrance. Other than that I am happy with the items I order from amazon"
1,difficult to successfully purchase scent without smelling it....,Love SJP but was disappointed in her Parfum. Very common and one dimmensional; lacks sophistication and complexity. Didn't find it subtle and couldn't wait to shower it off. That's just one girl's opinion; I'm sure there are others who might feel differently....
2,Product has changed: diluted with alcohol,"When I got the spray (Jessica Parker's ""Lovely"" perfume spray,Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker for Women 3.4 Eau De Parfume SprayI noticed it was a different color than one I had, e.g. slightly orange like and not the pink tinge of the original one. In smelling I noticed that the one recently ordered had a definite alcohol smell, whereas the original I had did not. What a shame. I am sure this was to cut costs and hoping customers woulod not notice. Well I did and will not buy again...what a shame because it HAS BEEN my favorite. I do wonder if the difference is because I bought on line and not directly in a store. In the meantime, Buyers Beware. Jonina Weeks"
5,So glad I tried it!,"I was looking for a new scent that wasn't too sweet or fruity. This is a subtle, sexy scent. My only complaint is that I don't think it lasts too long. I would still buy it again."
5,AN ULTRA FEMININE SCENT,"Is there anyone who doesn't know the name Sarah Jessica Parker? Okay. Think ""Carrie"" on TV's enormously successful ""Sex and the City."" She was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour. She brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance, ""Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker.""It's a unique, almost indescribable blend of classicism, chic, and innocence. There's not a scent like it with top notes of fresh Mandarin, Bergamot, Lavender, and Apple Martini. Vibrant and warm it's a fragrance that caresses the senses.Middles notes are Patchouli, tender Paper Whites, and luxe Orchid. These are enhanced by bottom notes of irresistible white amber, sensuous cedar, and the very sultry musk. This is a scent I revel in, and enjoy wearing.The bottle is, of course, simple and exquisite, curved with polished glass, ultra feminine.Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker is a beautiful, dreamy yet quite alive fragrance appropriate for every occasion."
5,Classic Scent,"This is a classic fragrance, not your overpowering J-Lo, B'Spears, etc. I wish I could explain the scent...but it is tough to describe. It isn't fruity or flowery. Perhaps a bit of lavendar though? Basically, you don't overpower a room with it. It has a bit of an ""old-world""-ness to it...but as far as I am concerned, that is a wonderful thing. I am a 31 year old professional, I wear it daily and out at night, and I just love it."
2,"Great smell, but doesn't stay on.","I love the smell of this perfume. However, it doesn't last. I have been wearing perfume for 18 years now and have used several different kinds without a problem. I was sold by SJP on this perfume when she appeared on Oprah. Loved it when I went to the counter at the mall to check it out. I have been using it for about 2 months now and it just doesn't last. About and hour after I put it on, I (or my husband) can't smell it anymore. Trust me, I learned to apply it liberally and it still doesn't stay. Totally disappointed."
3,"Like the smell, but doesn't stay for long","I loved the smell at first, when I saw the sampler in a magazine. When I wear the perfume, it feels good. Not a great one, but a good one. But, the smell doesn't stay beyond couple of hours. When I used it for work place, by afternoon, no hint of Lovely!I'm not a hater of this perfume. But nothing motivates me to buy this again!"
5,Lovely perfume,"Love this perfume so much. Have worn for many years. Sarah Jessica Parker made a fantastic smelling perfume. I would highly recommend this perfume to all women, no matter how young or old. And, I will positively purchase this item again from Amazon, since the price was so reasonable."
3,allergic!,"great perfume, funny I realized the reason I always buy the knock off version of this is that the real one has a lot of white flower in it which gives me a total headache. so even though this was a great purchase I can't wear the perfume don't know what to do with it"
5,sjp lovely perfume,"Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker for Women, Eau de Parfum, 3.4-Ounce Spray BottleThis is a wonderfully light, refreshing and subtle scent. there are top notes of floral, with a basic musk and amber underlayer. perfect for daytime wear or evening, although I do recommend you try it out first before buying. If you like any of the J Lo fragrances, you will enjoy this little addition to your fragrance wardrobe. Prices here are so much better than at any mall!"
4,Nice but not for me,"After smelling it, my first thought was-I've smelled this before! Since I love perfume and tried quite a few over the years, it didn't take me too long to identify it. It smells like a lighter version of Ysatis by Givenchy which I always liked but thought it was too strong. This is much lighter and airier but the scent is still the same. This is a nice scent, very sophisticated and for some reason, I picture it as being more suitable for mature women rather than young girls."
5,Nice Product,"Item was well-packaged, shipped quickly, and arrived before promised. An altogether very nice transaction!"
3,Intercontinental Service,I live in England and my Daughter and family live in Michigan so on her birthday I log on to Amazon (USA) to buy her a gift. Most women love perfume and anything endorsed or named after Sarah Jessica Parker has to be good. Incidently the service between the UK and the USA using Amazon is excellant. Goods always delivered on time and currency conversion done on ones credit card is at a fair rate. Thank you once again for delivering the goods.Regards John
2,Musky :(,"If you like Musky smells, you'll like this. I Hate it but that's me.Gave it to my Mom she loved it. If you like floral/ powder/ fruity smells you wont like this."
2,overrated,"I am not too pleased with this purchase. After all the great reviews, I was expecting more. But may be ok for the price"
1,"I love this parfum, however I didnt receive what I ordered the seller substituted the item","I truly enjoy this parfum, I have purchased this item many times through Amazon.com until now the product has always been what I have ordered until this current order. The seller ""Pretty Princess"" DID NOT SEND what I ordered, they subsistuted my order without informing me of the change, they are unavailable for emails and never responded to my repeated requests for a review of my order so I could receive what I ordered. Amazon issued a credit to me and I am very happy with this. This is an outstanding product and will be ordering it again but not from this seller."
4,"A ""Lovely"" Scent","I bought this as a gift for my grandmother. To be honest, I think that this fragrance is suited for the 50+ crowd. It is a beautiful scent just the same."
5,"Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker for Women, Eau de Parfum, 3.4 oz",I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this perfume. It is my second bottle and certainly not my last. The scent lasts a long time and the price can't be beat. Try it! You will love it!
5,"Received as described, wife loved it",This was a Christmas gift and it arrived safe and sound and on time. My wife was delighted. She has used this fragrance before so we knew she would like it.
5,A MODERN SENSUOUS SCENT,"Is there anyone who doesn't know the name Sarah Jessica Parker? Okay. Think ""Carrie"" on TV's enormously successful ""Sex and the City."" She was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour. She brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance, ""Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker.""It's a unique, almost indescribable blend of classicism, chic, and innocence.

1,Yuk!!!!!,I do not like this fragrance. Smells cheap and to me its not good! Test at a store before buying! It may smell good on some people I guess.
3,Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker,It's not bad...just not the knock-out scent that I was looking for. My current favorites are Noa & Burberry Brit but always looking for something new & different. I'll use 'Lovely' from time-to-time but it loses it scent early & just doesn't wow me.
5,LOVELY,"My second FAVORITE perfume! I love the size, the smell, and of course the price!I don't know how many people use this perfume, but these days it is very hard to find this perfume. It used to be everywhere, like Walmart, but not anymore. I am glad I found a large bottle for a reasonable price."
1,Not Lovely,Not subtle at all - very overpowering. This scent gave me a headache and was so strong that I had to shower again just to get the scent off of my wrist.
3,Beautiful Scent but...,"I first learned of this frangrance from a co-worker. It smelt so nice, I had to have it. So, my husband surprised with a gift set for mother's day. This fragrance smells delightful. Unfortunately, it does not last long. I apply it in the morning and by mid-day, I need to put on more. :("
5,SATISFIED WITH PURCHASE,RECEIVED ITEM WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS. GREAT PRICE. I AM MORE THAN HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE. PLAN TO PURCHASE AGAIN.
3,Nice i like it,"the perfume, i like its smile BUT this time this perfume does not stay long time :(. I hope this product is not fake"
1,Minus Fragrance,"When I first received my fragrance I was very happy, after two weeks everything changed. Several squirts were not lasting even two hours. I contacted the company that supplied it with this discrepancy. At first they were not very receptive to doing anything because 14 days had passed. After a lengthly conversation with a higher up they agreed I could return it for testing and they would issue a new one to me. This was my first experience purchasing fragrance online and I'm not sure I'll do it again. It cost me another $6.15 to ship it back and it'll probably be another two weeks before I get it."
1,Not impressed at all...,"After hearing Oprah's rave reviews of this perfume, and seeing that it was one of her Favorite Things for 2005, I thought for sure I'd love it. I ran right out to the nearest department store for a sample of it! I just had to see for myself...Well, I was NOT impressed. The scent is so strong and overwhelming that it actually seemed to ""catch"" in my throat. I accidentally got some on my hand and after four hand washings I could still smell it. I guess, for those of you who like this perfume, that's probably a good thing.Anyway, I think this perfume is too ""old lady"" for my taste. It reminded me of J. Lo's Glow. Which I also have and don't like.For comparisons sake, perfumes I do like are Britney Spears' Curious, Clinique Happy, Escada Island Kiss and Lucky You."
1,Paint Thinner,"Such a disappointment. I love you SJP but, to me, your Lovely perfume smells like nail polish remover. In fact, I met up with a group of friends and immediately recognized the nauseating smell of this fragrance on a friend's girlfriend. After hanging out for a bit one of my guy friends yelled, ""Why does it smell like paint thinner in here?"" I was really embarrassed for the girl wearing it. Hopefully she remained clueless since all noses are different."
1,SJP Lied!,"I expected this perfume to smell light, airy, and for some reason I had imagined some sort of citrus bent to it. Not so... it's appalling. Another reviewer said it reminded her of old lady perfume, and it really does. It smells like rosewater mixed with hairspray. I wish I could get my money back and let SJP just how awful her product is. She's all over the place shilling this junk, she should be ashamed."
1,Old Mothballs,I bought this fragrance for my sister for her B-day and when I finally gave it to her it smelled just like old mothballs that you find in the back of the closet with a floral scent. So it went back to the store and I got a full refund. Don't buy this product you will be wasting your time and money.
1,STINKS,OPRAH LIED TO ME AND SAID ON TV THAT THIS IS THE BEST. I FELL FOR IT AND I BROUGHT IT AND THE SMELLS STINK. IT DONT LAST ALL DAY SO NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY IT . THE WORST PERFUME EVER.
1,Not so lovely,"I went to the department store to test this fragrance out. I was so excited to try and thought for sure I would just love it, especially after seeing SJP on Oprah talking about the fragrance.It smelled to me alot like old lady perfume. It was gagging. And the ""clean"" smell was alot like the smell of Sure Deoderant. I won't be buying this fragrance at all. It was a real dissapointment!"
1,The most stinkiest Perfume Ever,"I bought this from Amazon about a week ago! I'm sure this came from a merchant through Amazon! Well I purchased this based on previous reviews by others. Well, when I sprayed this on, it reminded of a floor cleaner? It was very strong, loud, with a dry down of rose?? Eeeewwww! I had a hard time washing it off. Never again will I buy a fragrance from here!! Buyer beware! In the trash can it went!"
1,Agree with S. Potts that it doesn't stay on.,I have used Lovely for several bottles. This is the first one that the perfume does not stay on. There are not many reasons why the perfume does not stay.
5,Light & Nice,"I usually don't like floral type perfumes (I like more spicier ones), but this perfume is an exception! It is really strong so a little goes a long way (well worth the price). A perfect scent for spring & into summer.. :)"
4,A PERFUME ONE DOESN'T TIRE OF WEARING,"Is there anyone who doesn't know the name Sarah Jessica Parker? Okay. Think ""Carrie"" on TV's enormously successful ""Sex and the City."" She was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour. She brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance, ""Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker.""It's a unique, almost indescribable blend of classicism, chic, and innocence.

4,A fragrance for all seasons,"Old lady? A scent for a man? I don't know what other users are smelling! Lovely is a nice, unoffensive floral musk that is basically a toned-down version of Narciso Rodriguez for Her - for those on the fence, I'd suggest Lovely, as it is considerably less expensive. I get a lot of favorable comments on this ""close to the skin"" scent."
2,not impressed,I bought this product because of all the good reviews. This was not the fragrance I expected. I did not think this was lovely.
3,A senior moment,"If you are more familiar with the Aurelio Zen books, then Michael Dibdin has veered off here for a sly and hard-hearted mystery set in a seedy old-folks' home (Dibdin is like Agatha gone sadistic). A word of warning: You enter the book via a convoluted, mind-bending dash for plot that is so boggling you may want to throw in the towel. Wait! All will be made clear soon, and in a wry, entertaining manner."
3,Nothing new,"Not a bad little book, but this material has already been covered extensively. Been there, done that."
1,"Oh, those Silly Angels!","What escapades they are up to!Has this press, this religion, totally run out of things to talk about, such that now we have to have a SECOND volume of discourses on Angels?I wonder how many of the students in this sad excuse for a religion ever make it past Volume III. I mean, I'll give the writer of the original two books some credit: they at least had the merit of people stopping panther attacks, men rising into the air, and the author being whisked all over the world and time like Aladdin on a magic carpet (Volume I)...and the never-realized possibility of hanky-panky between four youths in Volume 2.Where can this series possibly go next?Volume 21: Discourses on the Wings of AngelsVolume 22: Discourses on the Feathers of the Wings of AngelsVolume 23: The Feet and Hands of AngelsVolume 24: Thoughts on the Fingernails and Toenails of Angels (Very Clean!)Volume 25: The Asses of Angels"
3,Disappointed,"This recording of the B Minor Mass was very highly recommended in a review posted on NPR's website. It may very well be a superb performance, but the quality of the sound is, in my opinion, abysmal. I cannot in good conscience recommend it."
2,Very disappointing,"The soloists manage to focus well enough on their solos. But on the choral pieces, they're not able to muster a consonant between them. Except for the occasional ss or ch or ooo, the choral texts are a blur of schwa. And, the first soprano is frequently inaudible.Is it possible for an ensemble to be OVER-blended? Something is definitely wrong with the mix! It sounds like they were going for ethereal, but instead of angelic, it sounds quite ghostly."
1,Almost like they're not singing or playing...,"This performance is very hard to listen to.....very muted and restrained. One wants to say, ""Hey, sing out."" It's almost like they wrapped cotton and duct tape around the choir and the instruments.....to hush their sound. Plus, the music is a bit too over controlled. Wow, let these singers and musicians loose. One would expect more from a piece of this stature. Granted, the Klemperer is a bit over the top. I wish I had bought the Gardiner."
2,Swingle Singers in a Bus Accident?,"As much as I hated this record, like a rubbernecker can't stop looking at a traffic accident, I couldn't stop listening to this recording. The sound was freakish. The chorus sings accurately, but with a strange romantic lushness. I thought they might have been the Swingle Singers (does that date me?) or a small group from the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. That coupled with the overly recorded period instruments (yes, those are the sounds of the bassoon's keys being played) was bizarre. I kept thinking that a busload of singers from the Mormon Tabernacle had gotten into a wreck with the Concentus Musicus Wien. That said, at least this recording has more character (odd, though it may be) than the Harnoncourt. Somewhere there must be a decent period recording of this masterwork."
2,I can't believe all the 5-star reviews...,"...because this is by far the most boring, lifeless, soporific of all the HIP recordings of the B minor mass that I know. Go for the Gardiner, Parrott, or Koopman, or the Rifkin for something more extreme."
4,Trailer,"I do not own the soundtrack, and I'm not sure if anyone else has posted this, (if they have, I apologize for repeating it)but the song from the trailer is ""Everything is all right"" by Motion City Soundtrack. I was disappointed to see that it was not on the soundtrack. Hope this was helpful"
5,Great tunes from an underrated movie,Predictable but fun movie with a great soundtrack. The version of Eleanor Rigby alone makes this CD worth buying - the rest is a bonus.
5,"Song during the party "" its a remix i think""",hellodo anyone know what is the song that was playing during the party
1,"Green Day sings Holiday, not Weezer!","On this cd, is says ""Holiday"" by weezer. I saw this movie and it was Green Day's ""Holiday"". I know Weezer has a song called Holiday but Green Day's is completely different. Don't buy this cd. Billie Joe will sue whoever made this shortly..."
4,a wonderful book,"I was drawn to this book by the large amount of gorgeous pictures on almost every page that makes every recipe tempting to make.I have made several of the dishes and they were all a big hit. My husband has just moved to Canada from Greece and I was able to bring Greece dishes to him...The only recipe that was not so great was the melomacarona which did not resemble the sweets that I had many times in Greece.If you must choose one greek recipe book, this is a must have!!!"
3,Escargot Shells,"The shells were in good shape with no breakage of any in any boxes I purchased. They had good color, although I hoped the shells would have been larger.I used them to fill a large glass urn I bought at Pottery Barn. They look beautiful in there."
5,Handy Dish Rack,"This dishrack is well made and sturdy. It holds large and small plates, as well as coffee mugs, securely. It fits perfectly in a large-sized drain board and is the right size for our kitchen counter. The white vinyl looks both attractive and solid. It closes and opens easily when cleaning. I would definitely recommend this dish rack."
3,TRACK LISTING IN ERROR:,"Amazon's track listing for this cd single is in error. The accompanying songs actually are from another cd single for the song; ""Queer"" (see ASIN: B000006YX9).The correct song listing is:1. Stupid Girl2. Alien Sex Fiend3. Stupid Girl (Dreadzone Dub)4. Stupid Girl (Dreadzone Vocal)"
3,Ex-Genesis Guitarist Resurfaces!,"When Anthony Phillips left Genesis after the Trespass album, he vanished for 5 or 7 years. Until this. Mike Rutherford & Phil Collins appear, along w/ original King Crimson drummer Miles Giles, in an album that is gentle, mellodic, renaissance flavored and not as good as the Sides album or wonderful as Wise After the Event. But it's a must for fans of Phillips, which would be you if you'd heard either of the aforementioned releases. Get either of those CDs first, if you can, then you'll be set to enjoy Geese and the Ghost."
4,Debut proves to be finest effort.,"This is the first solo album released by this former Genesis guitarist. Recorded in 1977 with the assistance of fellow Genesis founder Mike Rutherford this effort proves to be an enormously satisfying listen. The tone takes a gentle and romantic look backward borrowing from English history and English folk/fairy tales. This is one of the more fully developed and realised efforts that Phillips has recorded. Where it is largely instrumental there are three cuts with vocals (two with Phil Collins). The guitar work takes center stage and is mostly acoustic and classically influenced. A wonderful effort, highly recommended...Simon"
3,Geese And Ghosts AND THINGS THAT GO BUMP IN YOUR HEAD.,"Though by no means a definative work, this album does have some great moments. There are previously unrecorded GENESIS works, two songs with PHIL COLLINS providing vocals and some tantilizingly haunting melodies in the body of work. Still a little too acoustic, Phillips sells the project a little short but again it has some rather classic moments. If you collect the works of Ant Phillips you shouldn't skip this one."
3,Insatisfaction,"The product is no doubt pretty good. However, due to the way it was sent, I had to pay to the federal government 60% more beyond the shipping and the value of the product, which made it more expensive in the USA than in any local store here in Brazil. It should have been sent by Sedex not by the way it was.That was not the first time I bought a product in the USA through the web. But, this was the first time it cost me too much.If the DVDs and CDs are authorized to be sold to this country, so, it means that the taxes are already implied on the shipping.I hope you may somehow compensate this prejudice."
4,Wazup wazup WAZUP,"Classic shows, one of the best black sitcoms of all time. All the characters was creative and funny. Simply love it."
1,Pointless...Not Even Funny...,"This humorless, dull and amateurish mess, was made in Spain of all places! Obviously trying to capitalize on the ""Charlie's Angels"" furor that was engulfing the globe at the time (1979). Not even the likes of - Blanca Estrada, Cristina Galbo, Sara Mora, Loreta Tovar, could save this sad excuse of a picture. Adriana Vega even had a bit-part (uncredited), reading a newspaper ad. I would not be surprised if the maniacs that financed this junk, were holdovers from the - Franco dictatorship (because not only was the movie not funny, there was no nudity at all!). Unless you enjoy torture, pass on this one! The DVD picture quality was good. NTSC, Spanish (English subtitles), NR 84 mins.Love and Peace,Carlos Romero"
3,"Great game, broke easily",I bought this game for my Dad as a Christmas gift and we had great fun with it for about twenty minutes. It has a lot of play options and gave us a few laughs... that is before the right arrow button got stuck on one of the controllers and brought our fun to an end. My only hope now is that the purchase wasnt a complete waste and that the original company will be willing to work with me to get it fixed with no additional costs.
3,Not bad tetris substitute,"The batteries last a long time. The cords are connected to each other, so you'll have to sit right next to whomever you are playing. The backgrounds on the tetris maps are monotonous and slightly interfering, but you should start whizzing through the three fun game modes soon enough. It has one idea the tetris I played never had, but is useful enough to make a regular choice. You can pick the Dig mode to get a screen with lots of holes in it already. The games have a definite end and are a little too short, but if you are planning on quick rounds or playing with children, this is a good little toy."
1,My Dogs Hate This Food,"If this is supposed to be a top notch dog food, my dogs sure don't think so. There is a very odd smell to this food, it almost smells as if it is bad. Same smell came from the Bison flavor as well. My dogs won't eat it. Obviously other dogs like it otherwise they'd be out of business. Sorry I wasted money on 2 cases of this stuff."
5,One of my favorites...,"this is perhaps the ONLY Larry Carlton album that I can listen to over and over again...and I have been doing just that since the album came out on vinyl many years ago. My favorite cut is ""Perfect Peace"", and one has to listen to it on a quality stereo to appreciate it fully. The whole album is gorgeously recorded, and that is important for audiophiles like me. I recently bought the CD version (one of very few albums that I feel I want both formats)...it's good, but cannot compare to the vinyl version. I wish Larry would make another like this; ""DISCOVERY"", the follow-up to ""ALONE"" is truly disappointing."
4,Cozy Christmas Read,"I was looking for easy, quick, fun Christmas stories, I read both Mistletoe and Holly, and Misletoe and Molly. Enjoyed them both. This sweet story about Holiday romance with the love apprehensive Leslie and the endearing Miss Holly is fun and sweet. Holly's dad Tagg won't take no for an answer and opens Leslie's heart. Read both the Mistletoe books if your looking for easy and fun Christmas reading. I love to get a bunch of Christmas books during the holidays and read, read, read..........it really gets me in the spirit."
5,It Rocks!,"What to say about the best band in the world, Garbage. I am collecting all of Garbage's B-side tracks at the moment, and I am so glad that I bought this one. Shirley amazes me all the time with her sassy, vixen-like approach to vocals on ""Queer"", and the song ""Trip My Wire"" is just fantastic. Amust have addition to a collection of any Garbage fan, because the remixes are great too. Buy Buy Buy!"
5,Flaxman-The Great Illustrator of the Iliad and Odyssey,"For those of us who grew up with Alexander Pope's translation of the Iliad and Odyssey, John Flaxman's accompanying neo-classical illustrations greatly enhanced the experience. His elegant line drawings vividly brought Homer's stories to life. ""Flaxman's Illustrations to Homer"" brings all of the illustrations together in one volume. The introduction and commentaries by Robert Essick and Jenijoy La Belle put these extraordinary drawings in the proper historical context. This book was published by Dover Publishing in 1977 and can be purchased for a very reasonable price. Recommended."
5,I love this lotion!!,"I recently purchased this with Neutrogena's Healthy Defense SPF 30 in light tint which I have been using for about 2 years now, I love that product and thought that I would try something new for a night lotion. I find for me that my face cannot handle heavy night creams as they will break my face out. This is really wonderful I have been using it for about 4 days and can say I already am noticing a reduction in my pores and my face has a glow that it hasn't had in awhile. I have used other more expensive products and I think this really is better for me. My skin isn't bad, but I am in my early 30's and have noticed some fine lines and that I have been losing some of my nice texture, but this is bringing it back. I use this in conjunction with Neutrogena's new resurfacing system and it has made my skin look very nice, my husband even commented that it looked really nice."
2,Leather Cover Came Off,"I bought this as a gift for my mother. After nearly a year, the leather covering of the Bible is coming off and you can easily see that it was glued on. I was very disappointed and embarrassed when my mother showed me. The Bible itself is fine (content-wise) but the cover is a big let down."
3,Excellent approach to B2C selling,"The audio CD is very good tool for beginners who need to know more about selling techniques , however you need to know that :1. The target customers are clients of commidities purchase and not business to business approach.2. Mostly the audience need to be english native language to get most of the lecture in pure english accent.Other than this it's great resource to invest and ""value for money""."
5,What you need to know about sales,"This book contains what every salesperson should know about sales. There are not reasons for not getting sales, you just didn't get past the objection. This book puts things in a whole new light. I highly recommmend it."
3,Good read but old tatics,"Zig is good. I will admit he has the right attitude and plenty of good advice. He makes you feel pumped up after reading this book but this type of selling is dated. Customers are to educated and savvy. To much info out there with the internet. You can't sell benefits anymore and customers have to trust you. So, sorry to say, Zig Ziglar or anyone's closes do not work anymore. If you really want to learn to sell in this century, check out a book called ""Sales Therapy"" by Grant Leboff. It will change your life. Good luck out there."
5,Knew the man; loved the book,"I had the great good fortune to know Zig Ziglar personally and to be able to call him ""friend."" Following his recent death, I found myself thinking back to all the wisdom I had learned from him over the years in his other books and the multiple times I heard him live. I knew that I hadn't extracted all the wisdom I could from his life, and, given that we are ALL ""Selling"" in one form of another, I decided to get this classic book he wrote several years ago.It is quintessential Zig. Straightforward, kind, empathic, self-deprecating, and full of life lessons - not only for sales, but just generally living a better life. If one is ""in sales"" full time as a career, this book should be in your library (and you should have READ it. :) ) If you do not identify yourself particularly as ""being in sales"", it's still a useful book. Highly recommended."
1,Don't pollute your mind with this waste of time.,"These techniques may have worked 40 years ago but, now, in 2004, buyers are keen to this ""old pro's"" dialogs. After reading this book, ""The Closers"" and ""How to Master the Art of Selling"", you will see the difference I'm talking about and realize that this book is a joke."
2,Zig Ziglar's Secrets of Closing the Sale,"I do not remember the condition that the book was advertised but the condition of it when I was received it was not what i expected. The pages are yellow and the binding is bad. While reading it, I was afraid pages would start falling out."
3,Not what I expected,"Though helpful, I'm pretty sure the book is better. My manager advised me to buy this to better myself in my sales career. Though Ziglar touched on a lot of important subjects in the world of sales, there are a lot of portions in the book that are not on these audio CDs (such as the Feel - Felt - Found method of selling, I found that out from my manager afterwards). I just wish it was more consistent."
4,"""Your business is either good or bad right between your own two ears""","""Remember, when a person brings up a logical objection you answer it emotionally, and when he brings up an emotional objection you answer it logically"" - That statement is what I most remember about this book. Ziglar's tips on overcoming objections and closing are very helpful; atleast, it helps you validate your ideas. ""A calm, confident, positive, reassuring salesperson working from a base of honesty and integrity is the most effective tool to calm the fear of the prospect and get the sale."" ""Since your integrity is the most important factor in building customer loyalty and career stability, the practicality of a totally honest relationship becomes even more obvious."" You see him repeatedly emphasize the importance of honesty and integrity, that coupled with his tone and style makes it a nice read."
4,Entertaining,"Zig is a entertaining speaker. This book was a good ""pump you up"" for Sales book. The techniques are more anecdotes, but nonetheless the stories are still entertaining. The biggest take away from the book for me was that people can usually tell how you feel about what you're selling. You need to be convinced that what you're selling is of high value, or brace for failure. ""You have no business selling cookware that you don't own yourself."""
4,Excellent resource,"Many of my colleagues consider this the Bible of sales techniques. It's a superb tool for learning the skills of selling. It's well organized, concise and entertaining."
5,One of a kind!,This audio book changed my way of approaching sales. It is a classic must have that will change your life.
2,A bit out dated and weird audio format,"I was looking for something a bit newer, a lot of what he talks about is still basic sales 101 and still applies. However the audio track format is strange and it seems to be in reverse and always repeats to the previous track rather than moving automatically to the next track in line. It's a bit annoying to have to watch it and manually move it to the next track so it doesn't just repeat the previous one on you. There is also so cheesy sounding narrator on some of the tracks that I could have done without as well, knowing what I know now I would have looked for something else easier to use and more updated."
4,Good Read,"Very good book so far, but you really have to concentrate and focus or you will lose what is being stated. Good techniques."
4,Good Reference on the Sales Profession and Dealing With Objections,"""Secrets of Closing the Sale"" contains several different closing methods and how to deal with the various objections salespeople hear from potential customers.Among the points covered in the book include:1. 5 reasons why customers won't buy from you and how to address those reasons.2. Help people get what they want and you'll be successful.3. Do not lie, mislead, or oversell!!!4. Belief in your product or service is critical and the prospective customer will pick up on that.5. Empathy vs. sympathy.6. Characteristics of the professional salesperson.7. Characteristics of the unprofessional salesperson.A good reference and recommended. I will periodically refer back to the title for insights and reminders on how to deal with objections.Read and enjoy."
5,Well ahead of it's time -- A Timeless Classic,"If you are in sales or for that matter, have a job, you must be in a position to persuade people and/or get what you want from them.I have about 200 sales/marketing books and this one is in the top 3 if not the TOP.Advice: Read/ Re-Read and Re-Read again and agin.... Take many many notes"
1,WARNING - Audible.com version is not unabridged book as advertised,"Do not be misled by the claim that the Audible.com version is the unabridged version of Zig Ziglar's classic ""Secrets of Closing the Sale"". The download you will get will actually be a version of ""Ziglar on Selling"" and a recorded seminar done by Zig on closing.The real book gets 5 stars but the audio book gets ZERO stars for false advertising."
4,great playing but where did you get that mullet?,"Well, basically it is all cra*! The music today is all cra*...what's the deal with distortion boxes?? It is mindless string bending and artificial harmonics and a few power chords over and over and over. The vocals are the worst. Do you teach?"
4,Thangz are about to get wild,"Can these three girls get any wilder? If so, it would be unbelievable. Brea is a Bronx native and is hip to the street. The only way to make a dolla is to hustle. A nine to five is not going to work. Using her body to gain not only attention but money she is on top of her game.Trina is the rich girl out the group and is still battling her nerdy ways from high school. Hanging out with her girls brings out a side that not only shocks her friends but her as well. Having a big butt and a smile is not what it's cracked up to be.Jazmyn can only deal with her friends for so long. Brea is way too much. Being ghetto is not always cute. Trina is getting way too wild. Trying to hold down the fort and pursue her singing career is getting way too much for her to handle.For these three trouble is unavoidable."
5,Whatta Encore!,"I anxiously awaited another novel from Winston Chapman and was very happy that the wait was worthwhile! I loved the interaction between the characters and Chapman's ending always leaves me wanting more! I don't wanna give away the story, but some familiar characters make a cameo from Chapman's other novel, Caught Up.Keep them coming!"
4,Another great young adult edicational piece.,"This is a 1920 work for young adults. The story begins in a small farm in a small village in France. The father and uncle have just been called to war (WW1) and the family must run the Silk farm without them. Most of the learning about silk is dialogue within the family, and with a friend at a silk factory.If you enjoyed any of the authors other works, you will enjoy this one as well. A bit less adventure and more realistic plot development then other works."
5,Discovering Our Zen Heritage,"Zen's Chinese Heritage - The masters and their teachings, by Andrew Ferguson, is a long awaited reference for those wishing to appreciate the origins of the Zen tradition. As a long time practioner of Zen, the many illustrious and noteworthy ancestors of my tradition, have often been nothing more than a confusing collection of names, difficult to pronounce and even more difficult to appreciate as once real and living men and women. Andrew Ferguson's painstaking efforts at bringing to life these practioners of old, and providing us with history and anecdotes from their allusive lives, has enlivened my practice and given new meaning to the many wonderful and amazing persons I encounter in my koan study. This book is a wonderful guide and reference, especially with its accompanying lineage chart, for anyone who is either a practioner of this wonderful tradition or is solely interested in furthering their appreciation for the history of Zen."
5,Where has this book been all my life?,WooH Nelly! How did this gem come out in these samsaric times? A real God-send (or is that Buddha-send in this case?)
3,Could be better,"The movie was good. It has a good argument,but its too simple. When I bought the movie was to use it as an audiovisual resource in my biblical study but wasn't good for that."
3,Doctrinal issues but good story,"I guess it's logical that since it's produced by Billy Graham it would teach things like eternally burning hell and when you die you go straight to heaven. But had I known this, I wouldn't have bought the video. It's still a good story in general. The problem is just with the ending."
4,Just watch it and take it for what it is worth...,"I first heard of this movie while I was on a mission trip to Roatan this summer. The missionary said that we were going to have a movie night and we would watch ""Last Flight Out."" I was glad that we got to see this movie while on the mission field. I know the actors are not the best, but what is to expect. They played their parts and showed their love of God and their devotion to reach others. I'm glad that I watched this movie, and am about to add it to my own DVD library."
5,Missionary film,I love movies that have to do with God and/or are biographical. I also love the Billy Graham movies produced by his World Wide Picture Company. This movie was very good.
2,The right book written by the wrong people,"This book is mainly based on what was called the 'Wehrmachtsausstellung' or an exhibition on war-crimes of the wehrmacht during WW II. It has to be said that meanwhile this exhibition has been partly revised after a number of court trials revealed a considerable number of untrueisms.Yet, it is a fact that some German soldiers were involved in mass shootings of members of the communist party and jewish civilians, and for that it is a necessary book. On the other hand, a whole number of incidents simply did not occur as shown in this book, many were committed by the NKWD (later became KGB) and the Germans got blamed for it. Let me point out, this is not opinionbut things which were found out during court trials before German courts, and even former KGB members testified this."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in thisCD. I was expecting more songs from the movie. The CD from the movie is not available.
4,she was lovely was'nt she,another soul sent to the devil before her time but she made some okay songs these tunes are alright but she paid the price with her life but still you like selena cop this.
3,"Nice Idea! But again, Another Greatest Hits?","I am a huge Selena fan. I collect everything that is released by her. This a very good album, but it has previously released songs we already own. I love the idea that they did put just her English songs on here,but I would not consider any of them hits. The only ones that were hits were ""I Could Fall In Love,Dreaming Of You,Missing My Baby,and I'm Getting Used To You"". As for the rest,while they are very good songs, they were not hits. Just songs from when Selena was younger and then unreleased songs that were included on the Selena Soundtrack. It is clever to release it in her memory. I do recommend this to any Selena fan that is just wanting to learn about her English market songs. If your looking for true Selena classics, Pick up the 2003 album ""Ones"" or the 2005 album ""Unforgettable - The Studio Album""."
5,Selena's CD of Greatest Hits,I have enjoyed many hours playing the CD of Selena's Greatest Hits. I play them in my car going to work. I play them at home and i like to sing along. She was a great singer and it is sad that we don't have her around any more to sing more songs. I hope you buy one of her CD's she is really a great singer. At Amazon you can find all kinds of music from around the world. From country to love songs old and new. I hope you give Selena's CD a try.
1,Could have live versions,"Selenda was famous for her live concerts, an aspect that made me initially fall in love with her singing. She sounded better live that she did in studio, and you could always feel the electricity. I would have liked to have seen live versions on this disc, it would have made it so much better."
1,Uninteresting Rambling about Godel,I used to know Hao Wang and to a lessor degree Godel. Both were fine mathematicians and anything they would have had to say about mathematics I would have wanted to know. Not surprising as I was a professor of mathematics at the University of California. I admit to not knowing much about philosophy and this book is concerned with Godel's philosophical thinking. I learned for example that Godel rejected logical positivism which was interesting to me. But when I also learned that Godel created ontological proofs of the existence of both God and the hereafter; proofs that Godel acknowledged would be unconvincing to those who weren't already convinced I began to feel there wasn't much meat for me to chew on in this book. A few chats with professional philosophers about Godel's well known philosophical views convinced me - the book was not for me.Apparently Wang thought otherwise and so you have to decide for yourself.
5,A really Plumbers Pocket Manual,"I have read it fully and I have noticed that some aspects of the plumbing trade not well explained in other books are here very well explained. I considered this pocket manual a must have for every plumber and for serious students of the plumbing trade. I very trully recommends this pocket manual for everyone. It is a small book that you can carry everywhere you go, spcially while sitting in an office waiting your turn, that is where I have read it more. I have read it twice and stil carry it with me every place I go."
3,"Somewhat dated, needs significant revision","This book is a pocket manual, as such, is by no means the definitive work on plumbing. It is now in its 10th edition and many of the photos in the book appear significantly dated. So, too, some of the plumbing methods also appear dated, i.e., the use of lead piping (no longer allowed in many jurisdictions); the use of cast iron sewer pipes sealed with oakum and melted lead (again, this has been supplanted by plastic and/or metal piping in many jurisdictions) are particularly anachronistic. While a good primer in a limited way, it is by no means a resource for someone preparing for an exam or looking to ensure plumbing work is in compliance with the code. There are other, more recent books that serve this purpose. This is a book that appears to have been written in the 1930s and only periodically updated as required. It needs a complete re-write to bring it to currency and relevance with modern building codes."
5,Book for all Generations,"Under the Wire brings the WWII era to life throught the eyes of young wanderer become Spitfire pilot and POW William Ash. Ash is first of all, along with his co-author, an entertaining writer. He carries a lighthearted tone through the book to help readers through even some of the darkest times of the war. Readers will be thankful that Ash finally put his tale down on paper. You don't have to be interested in war or of a war generation to appreciate this book. It is a memoir for every age and accessible to all readers. Ash brings readers into the world of the German POW camp and shows what it was like to live through it. This is a book of heroes and thank God for them."
5,Amazing: Shawshank Redemption meets The Great Escape,"I just wanted to jot down a few words about Under the Wire. William Ash's personality shines through the words and paragraphs of this superbly written book like a supernova and by the final page you are left not only wanting to know more about this genuine hero (who helped inspire Steve McQueen's character in The Great Escape) but also a burning desire to meet this bloke and have a pint with him. Self-deprecating, laid-back and a little bit insane here is a bonafide adventure-monger who stood up to the Nazis and would not be bowed by the most extreme circumstances most of us could barely imagine.If you like Shawshank Redemption, Touching the Void, Of Mice and Men, The Battle of Britain and Stalag 17 then here's a book that will not only grip you in its tightly woven fist but importantly leave you cheering by the time you turn the final page.PS Why haven't they made this into a movie?"
1,Loved the Christian theme..not storyline!,"I love contemporary African-American novels. Our brothers and sisters have a pletheora of talent when it comes to writing! I love that it had a Christian theme, but the dialogue was not realistic at all. Black people don't react they way the author portrays them. Just doesn't happen. Put the book down severl times and trying to complete...it is hard..too much drivel."
5,Great Great Great!,All I would like to say is that I read this book in one day could not put it down - a page turner indeed. This one is for my collection and there are no words to explain how much I enjoyed this book.
4,A Romance worth reading,"...The story begins with Jake and Tori, who are faced with distrust and insecurities in their marriages. Jake realizes that he is not strong enough to handle the tragedy that he and Tori must face. To escape, he runs. Tori prays to reconnect with her husband and her pains guides her as she puts the past behind. On the other hand, Charlene and Shepard are eager to marry but Charlene holds a secret that could destroy their love.The reader get a sensational uplifting spirit from the beginning to the end of the book. In the end reader will be encouraged to ""Let things go and let God""..."
3,Christian are human too!,"Enjoyed the book, but felt that some of the scenes were unrealistic. Example, Jake's return, Jake's abandonment, Jake being naive about Sheila & Jake's attitude upon his return - no apology - no explanation or reason for his abandonment. There was a definite change in Tori, but Jake's change was non-existence - did Jake really make any sacrifices? NO! I agree with Aunt Kate - leave the Madison men ALONE."
5,Great Christian Fiction!,"I recently met the author at the Word's Escape Me Summit in Birmingham, AL. She gave me an advance copy of The Prodical Husband. I just wanted to let her and amazon readers know that I think she has a winner! It was nice seeing things through Tori's eyes and following her through the process of forgiveness.It seems to me that the author could tell a few other stories about some of the secondary characters in the book. Shepard sounds like an interesting man. I am sure he and Charlene have an interesting story. I was also intriqued with Aunt Kate.Her secret should make an interesting tale too. SomehowI get the feeling that Shelia isn't finished either. Jake better watch his back! Anyway, Jacquelin Thomas is one of my favorite authors in the Romance genre and she is quickly becominga favorite of mine in inspirational fiction. Ms. Thomas, you are very gifted at what you do. I look forward to reading many more of your novels. Keep up the great work!!!!!"
4,A guilty heart,"This book was is well written. I like the writer and have read many of her books. The husband was so consumed by guilt that he could not see that his wife would have forgiven him for the accident. Instead he turned to the manipulative partner, who blinded him to the virtues of his wife and encouraged him to stay away from his home. But in the end love conquers all. That would have been an appropriate title for the book."
4,What's a woman to do?,"I thought that Jacquelin Thomas portrayed an accurate view of the plight of the black man & subsequently the black woman. Jake had severe issues and could only focus on that, while his wife was left to grieve & suffer alone.There is a great lesson to be learned from this book. Jake finally realized that he was lost without Christ. He had an emptiness that only God could fill. His wife and mother & family could not do it for him. When he found The Lord then everything began to come together.Tori displayed great strength when faced with adversity. She didn't let it show when she was in public & handled her 'business' when it was necessary. She also came to her own while abandoned by her husband & would not let herself revert back to the 'old way' when he returned. He had to accept her for who she had become.I was truly pleased with how it ended. Great work Jacquelin!"
3,Could be better,"This book kept my interest only because it got some kind of emotional rise out of me. I was irritated through most of the book. Honestly I wished Tori would have left with Nicholas, but then there would be no story. I was also happy to read about a marriage that wasnt perfect, but still stayed in tact. Anyway, the ending is very predictable. And there are no twists in this story. Sheila was the only interesting character. She actually had some depth to her. Even though she was twisted, a whole book can be written about her alone. Just put her in the hands of Eric Jerome Dickey, and she will cause all types of trouble. In the hands of a more socially conscious writer such as Toni Morrison, she will warp into something unbelievably confusing, yet wonderful. All in all, this could have been a better read."
2,Slow and Repetitive,"Oh people, I got to tell you the truth. This story is so slow and the author repeats the same things over and over again. Another thing is that black people do not talk like the characters the author is portraying. This is a good book title, but it needs another storyline with stronger black characters that don't pretend to sound white. Sad to say, I could not finish this book because it was going in circles. I skimmed through it and of course, predictability was inevitable. The main character, Jake, really was not what one would call a ""prodigal husband."" Thomas should have made his character more like the prodigal son of the Holy Bible. Jake didn't do enough dirt to be considered a prodigal husband.I'd like to see Terri MacMillan or Sister Souljah rewrite this story using the same title, or perhaps a strong contemporary christian fiction writer could rewrite it.I love christian fiction, but I wasn't feeling this story at all."
4,Good reading and interesting characters,"Ms Thomas has just graced us with her second Christian Fiction novel and again, she has done a superb job. In this one, she explores how love and prayer can conquer the devil's attempts to destroy the marriage of Jake and Tori Madison.Tori and Jake's young child is killed in an automobile accident in which Jake is the driver. Unable to face Tori and his own guilt, he flees the hospital. Does not even attend the child's funeral.After a year of not knowing where her husband is, Tori starts to take control of her life, only to have Jake reappear. Tori has never stopped loving Jake and is willing to take Jake back if he goes to counseling. But his year long absence has not changed him very much. Tori standing firm in her beliefs needs and wants change to move ahead.What to do? Read and find out the answers and challenges this couple must face."
1,Weak Story,"This book wasn't all that good as some of the reviewers says. Actually, I think it was a stupid story. The husband was so blind and stupid and his wife was a wusp. Don't waste your time or money on this one. Instead read, ""That Faith, That Trust, That Love."""
4,It's Good,Within the first five pages this book will grab your attention. It has it's moments where it drags towards the middle of the book (hence the 4 stars) but overall it's a good buy. You'll enjoy it.
1,Should be Less Erotica in Penthouse Letters,"As an avid reader of the Penthouse letters I have begun to realize that one must read 100 letters of crap before you get a good story ....This bogg is touted as the best in real stories by real people is a misnomer unless the editor managed to find all the letters that I think stink... If you are into watching your wife get it from a merry menage of guys this book is for you ...Personally I always like the surprise seduction type of letters that take at least two or three paragraphs of situational development before they start to, ahem, forgive the pun, but sink their teeh into it ...."
4,Two great remixes of Queer,"This CD includes two great to listen to remixes of Queer and the b-side song Butterfly Collector, which is not as good as some of their other b-sides but still good."
4,Genuine Dance Party Music,Iv'e listened to alot of dance party music but this collection is mature. This is a must for dance party fanatics. You won't be disappointed by making this title as part of you dance party cd collection.M.D.E.
3,"Decent text, but instructions to beginners are in spanish","I have used this text for one quarter at the JC level. Decent organization, abit overdone on the use of color; it gets distracting rather than help organize sections. Too little offered to guide in pronuciatoion early. Instruction for the exercises from the beginning are in spanish, which makes as much sense to the student as putting the instructions in German. My version (different version? can't tell from this description) came with a CD, which is useless, given it is aimed at a much higher level. The cassette tape is also useless, as it contains very little material. The Workbook (which was also bundled, but may not be included in this ISBN) is pretty good, but could use more exercises early on."
4,Great for gigging guys-n-gals,"The ONLY thing I did was remove the handle & wheels. The 3"" cheapies, were more trouble than they were worth. Bought a $30 folding dolly/cart from Lowes as an alternative to those useless wheels, and the too-short handle."
4,Essential book for Foose fans,"This is a well written book that does provide both a behind the scenes look at the original OverHaulin series and the decisions that go into each build. While some of the stories I had not seen the episode for I still enjoyed reading the background on while that individual was chosen. The color pictures are great, just wish there could have been more. But this is still a good book. I hope they consider writing another on some of the other builds featured on the show."
1,The most unadventurous traveller ever,"I cannot believe that in this day and age someone could write a breathless account of her travels with a bus package tour in Italy - and find a publisher for it! The author of this book takes herself so seriously in her faux-independent travels, sending postcards to herself form her various totally boring destinations - that it almost fits into the ""so bad it's good"" category. But not quite."
4,A woman you'd want to travel with,"This book is by turns funny and touching. A middle-aged divorcee decides to take time off from her work and life in America and travel abroad by herself. She doesn't really end up being by herself, of course, and that's what makes the book so much fun. As she travels to France, England, and Italy, she meets both natives and other travelers with whom she briefly becomes entangled.Perhaps the one sour note of this book is her relationship with Naohiro, who she meets near the beginning and obsesses about throughout. To me, he is far less compelling than the trio of women whom she meets in England, the partying Australian analyst, or the woman she meets in France who is clearly in an unhappy relationship.Overall, though, I wanted to know this woman and have her as a travel companion--although that would be totally contrary to the theme of this book."
1,Bland on the Loose,"I was disappointed in this book, which I and my book club were looking forward to. What's the opposite of a tell-all memoir? The author mentions such events as meeting a foreign man, re-meeting him, and having an affair with him--but discreetly doesn't make him a subject of her story. Not that I'm prurient--this is just one example of the surface-skimming manner of the book. Alice (who writes herself postcards, a cloying device) sets off for adventure, a year of travel. Nothing much happens. She gets sick and some women take care of her, but we don't learn very much about them, about the countries she visits, or even about Alice. (To be fair, I'm writing this from the memory of a book read a few years ago.)"
4,Pleasant journey from the mind of a empty nester,"I liked this book because it opened up my mind to the opportunities available to those of us post children. The basis is that there will be a chance for self discovery and adventure once we let go of those of us who were once dependent on us.It's both a travelog, I ate here, I met these people, I went there, it was fun. And a journey of letting go of the calendar, of people I used to depend on. Its also a journey of a single day, as in I planned to do this, but found myself here instead. Yet if I had followed my original path that would have been ok too. On the otherhand its not so detailed as to be a replacement for a Fodors travel guide.I'm saving for my extended trip to Paris. I hope after reading this book you do to."
5,One of the best books I've read all year.....,"This book is utterly delightful! The way Alice goes about her travels is inspiring and really makes the dear reader want to follow suit. I love the way she meets people and makes friends in every place she goes and the way she embraces life, and isn't in a hurry to see EVERYTHING. Really... read this book. It is refreshing and inspiring!"
1,Previous Independent Traveler,"I lived in Italy for a year and Paris, France for two years before I settled down and had a family at 29 years old.I read this book because my book club chose it. When I read the back cover description and review, I became excited that I would be revisiting places I had loved. Alice Steinbach writes well, but I felt she didn't really feel or see the places she visited in a way that I found stimulating or educational. I had to make myself finish the book because it felt shallow and lifeless for me."
1,A Self-Involved Woman,"I found this book excruciatingly dull. It is about nothing except the author. It tells nothing of any city--at least not enough for anyone who doesn't already know the (few) cities mentioned well to get a feeling of them--nor does she ever go off the beaten path. (Even to go to Perugia and Sorrento, neither of which she even writes about, she goes with a group). What this book is, for the most part, is her ""twee"" postcards to herself (all addressed ""Dear Alice"" and signed ""Love, Alice"") and her junior high school musings about the man she's met in Paris and is having an affair with. If your idea of travel clothes are silk suits and you consider buying a black cheomsang style dress or wrap-and-tie espadrilles the height of daring, you may enjoy this. The author is a reporter, so I'm surprised she shows so little interest in other people--or in places, history, art, anything besides herself, for that matter. As for independence, this baby hasn't come a long way."
4,a charming book about midlife adventures,"I picked this book up on a whim with no preconceptions about it and loved it. After journeying with Steinbach to Paris, Oxford, and Italy, I know I will be giving this book to many other women. I enjoyed Steinbach's descriptions of each place and her internal experiences. I only wish her sections on England and Italy were as detailed as her long section about Paris. I wanted more. I understand she is writing another book and I'll be sure to read it.After reading some of the negative reviews, I wonder if Steinbach might appeal more to women of a certain age who can relate to the changes of midlife. That's who I will be buying the book for."
2,Guess You Had to Be There,"I was eager to read this book; after all, who wouldn't love to take an extended leave from his/her job and live in Paris, Oxford, and Italy? The book, however, is a sad disappointment. Alice Steinbach, a former reporter for The Baltimore Sun, has neither the wit nor wisdom to entertain or instruct. The writing is curiously flat and lifeless, her observations about life are mere platitudes, and her postcards to herself quickly become trite and embarrassing. I'm sure this sabbatical transformed her life, but she is unable to translate her experiences for the reader. Guess you had to be there."
4,Excellently written and thought provoking.,"It encourages one to step outside the box and take a look at your life. Find out who you are and what you want. As mothers and wives, we live our lives for others.. Not that that is a bad choice but we live through and for our loved ones and really don't know ourselves. This was similar to ""Eat, Pray, Love"" which I also loved."
4,"Fun to read, but not wholly fulfilling","I read this book while living abroad and traveling from my home base for short trips here and there. I could relate to the feelings of trying to find who I am when I'm not labeled, but I didn't feel completely satisfied at the end of the book. I enjoyed hearing about the places, the food, and people she met, but wanted more of something to bring it all alive."
4,Wonderfully descriptive,"I loved the locale descriptions included in her travels and traveled vicariously through her eyes. I dwelt in the depth of her characters, her unexpectd love interests, and the people she met along the way. I thoroughly enjoyed this from cover to cover"
1,Disappointed,"Reviewer: mg69For Alice Steinbach,a year off means staying at top-of-the-market tourist hotels in the top European cities, drinking coffee in celebrity cafes, taking a group tour in Italy, enroling in a summer school in Oxford and hanging out with other affluent English-speakers and compatriots.If you want an alternative to this sort of insulated travel experience, try ""Au Revoir"", Mary Moody's lively account of a riskier year off or Sarah Turnball's genuine life change described in ""Almost French""."
3,"female, over fifty and free","Without Reservations - Alice Steinbach3 starsIn 1993, Alice Steinbach took a leave of absence form her job as a journalist to spend a year traveling through Europe. She planned extended stays in some of the world's most beautiful places as she searched for a way to define herself away from the context of job and family. This was a pleasant, easy to read memoir about interesting people and exquisite locations. I liked that Steinbach traveled alone with no sense of loneliness or lack of confidence. She was open to new relationships, but was just as happy on her own. I found myself in agreement with her self-reflections on being single, over fifty and independent."
4,"WITHOUT RESERVATIONS, by Alice Steinbach","Picked it up, and could not put it down. It was one of the most enjoyable travel books that I've read in years. I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever wanted to pack it up, and take to the road, especially if you are a woman, around 45 and single. Whether you can actually take to the road or not, the places that Alice Steinbach visited were so intriguing and explained in such detail that I felt I too were out there with her."
4,Without Reservations,"This was a good Book Club selection, for discussion. I would not read it again nor keep this copy."
2,Sorry to disagree,"I really wanted to like this book. I am about the same age as the author, and I spent much of my 30s and 40s as a solo traveler. But I found this book full of cliches, self-justification, and name dropping. Sorry, folks...."
1,My reservations,"This book is all sell - great bookjacket, good idea, poor execution and the author doesn't even seem to know it. She is a fine prose writer from a technical standpoint, but has so little wisdom or insight into her own life, such a case of a somewhat developed intellect over soul. Flimsey and shallow, don't waste your time. Steinbach just isn't interesting enough to travel with if you're over 15."
5,EXQUISITE! CHARMING! DELIGHTFUL!,"I LOVED THIS BOOK SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!! It was just a wonderful escape at the end of the day and I hated to have it end! I only wish that Ms. Steinbach continue her travels, postcards and stories but PLEASE let us know just one thing: is Naohiro still in the picture????? I also appreciated the introduction to Freya Stark and this marvelous book has prompted me to search out her delicious books as well. Let's have more.......soon!!!"
5,Without Reservations,Without Reservations is a most enjoyable read -more like a personal travelogue which makes you want to book a flight tomorrow to somewhere you have always wanted to go and to forge ahead and be brave. There are so many places to go and people to meet if you just open up to the possibilities.
3,"Interesting enough to finish, but not enough to read again","The ""Toronto Globe and Mail"" describes Alice Steinbach's writing as, ""polished and professional."" While the writing was flawless and her journey was interesting, I found Steinbach's writing to lack the emotion and vividness of description that differentiates a readable book from an engaging novel. Also, since I am in my early twenties, I found Steinbach difficult to relate to."
4,Good Read,"This is an entertaining travel diary focused on exploration of being alone. In the book the author describes her travels and people she meets with detail that is important to her as a woman, a mother, a traveler. She doesn't give the reader any profound thoughts or philosophies on life - just a journey through a portion of her life. This is an easy read that might lead you to pondering your life."
1,Schubert Complete string quartets,"The title is completly different what is inside the cd.It is a quintet and a one part of one quartet. Not a ""complete string quartets""It is a shame of description, a lie of title andsomething new in Amazon.com. I suggest to everybody whodeal with Amazon to check twice what you get from your order.Disgusting !!!!"
1,NOT the complete quartets!!!,"I had the same issue as the reviewer above - got the Schubert Quintet, not the complete quartets. The pick label on the CD has ""complete quartets"" and that's the problem, which I pointed out to Amazon. Now they've sent me another order - but I imagine I'll get the same thing again. Amazon, get your warehouse cataloging sorted please!"
3,Causing cost,"Enjoyable but unspectacular nighttime piano jazz, though tracks like the closing ""What's to Ya "" proves Coasta a bandleader worth at least partial investigation."
4,Great follow up!,This is a great follow up dvd to the first volume.....Carlton is an exceptional player and both of these dvds are invaluable to guitar players of all styles.
2,Does not do the job for me.,"When I want to really scrape down, I don't need something like this. Compared to other products, I had to scrape twice as much to get the same clean feeling. Then, after using it, I became very suspicious as to how I was going to get this thing clean. After several rinsing attempts, the thing still feels weird, and I do not think you can totally clean this thing after use. Tried it a second time with even worse results. I eventually tossed the thing in the trash as a bacteria farm.You are better off buying the gloves on sale here at Amazon. They do the job AND you know you can get them clean after you use them."
2,Review of Padded Envelopes,"I was disappointed at how flimsy these envelopes are. To feel confident about mailing anything in them, I have to put additional padding in.I suppose I should not have been surprised when I saw how many envelopes were provided at such a low price."
4,Good for the price,I usually buy these type of envelopes on ebay but I saw that the price was better on amazon. It took a while to receive them but they work pretty well for the price. I really like that the tacky side sticks so well. I usually have to add more tape to feel comfortable that it is going to stick.
2,Not very strong.,The price was pretty good but the paper is thin on these mailers and will tear if you are not careful.
2,Cheap Price. Cheap Material,Size is not as stated. Much smaller. Tears easily. Material seems cheap. If you shipping anything 2 inches or smaller this might work. For me this is an okay product.
3,Much smaller than you might think!,"You might think that you could ship things that are 4x8 with this. You would be wrong. The actual inside area is more like 2.5x6 (I measured), and that's assuming the thing you're shipping has no height. I bought them to ship CDs, but they're too small. Thankfully it was cheap enough that I'm not too upset."
4,Perfect for frequent trading card traders,"I trade and sell MTG cards daily, so this was perfect. They're not quite your Scotch or 3M quality, but they're sturdy and light so a single top-loader in one of these can ship for two first class stamps and save me the trip to the post office. Other mailers I've used have been heavier and required three stamps, which was wasteful."
5,Pure Wisdom,This book explains Buddha's most profound teaching perfectly. This is the best modern day explanation of the Heart Sutra.
3,Outside Looks Nice But Inside Needs Help,"I was quite pleased with the nice leather cover and exterior appearance of this business card file. I purchased two of them. However the inside vinyl pages that hold the business cards are a major dissapointment because they are quite wrinkled, making it difficult to read some parts of the individual business cards kept in the book. The wrinkled pages also take away from the asthetics of the book. I have not found the wrinkles come out of the vinyl after the books are filled with cards."
2,Remastered With So-So Vocals,"Claire Hammil created an album I bought years ago in vinyl, Voices, which Really impressed me. I very recently (finally) found Voices re-released and available as a CD, so I ordered it. I ordered this album too, hoping for something good and new to me. Sadly, I found the vocals, although re-mastered, were difficult to hear over the accompanying instrumentation, and I was not very impressed by the song lyrics. I don't want to be mean, but it just held no comparison to the only other album of Claire's I have ever heard, the excellent Voices."
2,Not a keeper here.,"I was going to order this for my little shihtzu but knowing how picky he is I bought a can from the local pet store first. Glad I did, because Sheldon would have nothing to do with it. The chunks in it are huge for a little dog so I cut them up, but he still would only sniff it and walk away. Disappointing because I see now that they have the smaller cans I would have bought for him. Not sure if the pieces in those are smaller as well, but it doesn't really matter. He won't eat it."
5,No more Caesar's!,"Merricks is the best, not by products! No bones, wings, legs - food is so good even I WANT TO EAT IT!!!!!I love amazon, they have almost everything. Tracking number included too. Expires 2010, my dogs will be wayyyy finished with the food by then. thanks amazon!My dogs still love Grammy's potpie the best =)"
5,You simply can't do better than this...,"Carmen McRae was one of those artists that I hated at first. I wondered how she could possibly be compared to such talents as Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan, given the odd sort of sarcasm and irony that seems to haunt her voice. Nonetheless, this album changed my mind. In fact, Carmen is now one of my favorite artists and I own most everything ever printed on vinyl or CD....And it's all thanks to this album.If you haven't heard ""I Can't Escape From You"", then you've never heard Carmen at her best. This is, perhaps, the finest song she ever sang, akin to Sarah Vaughan's ""Ain't No Use"" in emotional weight and force. The rest of the album moves from ballad to swing without once losing the mood and feel of the album. It's one of those rare albums you can listen to from beginning to end without ever being tempted to skip a song.Buy it.Listen to it.Love it.Trust me, you won't be disappointed."
3,Good information that most people don't know,"I was impressed with the information presented. This film makes a strong case for the medicinal uses of cannabis and the safety of it. Very few people know about the research that has been done showing that it can be as effective and in some cases more effective than prescription drugs for pain, inflammation, nausea, cancer, and many other ailments. Because of the stronghold that the pharmaceutical industry has over medicine and doctors and the resistance to alternatives that they cannot patent and that people could easily grow/make themselves, most of the information about the health benefits of cannabis have been suppressed. This film is worth watching for anyone with an interest in taking charge of his or her health and a desire to use natural, traditional, health supportive modalities."
5,The Cannabis Video Everybody Should Watch!,"I Found this DVD very informative, with expert documentation. I believe many people would change their opinions about this plant, if they were given the opportunity to watch."
4,Excellent summary of therapeutic potential of marijuana,This is an excellent summary of one aspect of the therapeutic potential of marijuana. It is very professionally done and includes the latest science on this remarkable plant.
5,Informative book,"I've been a struggling lacto-ovo vegetarian for 16 years. Busy career/life made me take the easy route...whatever you can lay your hands on to eat that was meat free. PU! This book helped me in my search for a better way to eat, especially on the run."
2,100pg Book for $30?,"My fault for purchasing from the get-go.....Maybe I was thrown off the premium edition or whatever the phrase was, and then the book looked as if it was a re-sell and not brand new, so I couldn't get beyond the cosmetics to even check the content."
4,Practical Reasons for Raw Food Life!,Brendan tells his story & is very inspirational. He offers ideas and recipes. A good book to give to any one into sports. If Tiger Woods read this he'd win even more!
3,Something wrong?,I was looking for my son and noticed that it said price: $129.99. Is this some kind of prank? Or is it for real? I know my son's friend has one that he bought at walmart for less than $20. Are you kidding me? $130? Really?!
3,"Review of by a ""Nerf-er""","The Buzz Bee Rapid Fire Tek is an interesting and useful addition to any ""Nerfer's"" blaster collection as it utilizes the same mechanics as an old repeating rifle while being able to punch out a stable rate of fire against enemies in a Nerf War. But be sure to have friends assisting in the firefight because this blaster isn't meant to take on multiple targets at once without covering fire.All in all, a fun blaster and a good addition to any collection."
3,terrible trigger mechanism,This gun broke within the first week we bought it. It turs out that the trigger mechanism broke and when you cocked it it wouldn't lock. The trigger machanism is a lever that pulls back an air compresing piston on a spring and it gets locked into place by a little plastic hook-type-thing. So that broke of and we fixed it by putting a metal screw through it and gorrila glue but it just broke again.Hopefully it was just a bad unit Or buzz bee needs to make that hook-type-thing out of metal.
1,worst gun ever made,"NEVER EVER GET THIS gun.con's:uses shells(very impractical),not durible at all(fell apart in my hands after 10 shots),its yellow,orange and green,shoots about 10 feet if it does shoot which it does 1 in every 10 shots.pro's:couldn't find any pro's.so i hope you never ever get this gun."
3,Awesome to show off,"Man, when I spin this thing like Arnie in T2 during nerf battles at work people love it. Unfortunately as soon as I try to shoot it, I get laughed at. Basically the range on this thing after few months of use has gone down to... eh, 12 inches on a good day I guess.Now, I really don't care about that much, because this gun was bought to show off and mess around at work during the midst of our nerf war. It did what it was supposed to do, and I got plenty of credit for how awesome it is to have a repeater nerf rifle. But at this point i'm kinda glad i don't have to crawl around collecting shells and then reloading them. Oh, and if you shoot fast, this thing will rip a hole in a nerf dart in under 5 shots."
2,Too much!,"Don't purchase this online walmart carries them and they are only 9.99, such a big price not worth it, for that matter don't buy any of the ""rare"" ones like the grenade for 75 bucks also not worth the money when you can buy them at ""lower quality"" stores such as walmart, shopko, and random general name stores."
4,Rapid Fire Unique,"My purchase experience was very good, quick delivery, packaged well. As far as the product the Ruff Stuff products are not nearly as quality or durable as Nerf however the price point is lower and they have some unique designs that Nerf does not have. Therefore we will continue to buy the products knowing they will need replacement at some point."
2,crappy darts,Very cheap darts. They broke the first time my son tried to shoot them. The rifle is a cool idea but the dart were poorly made so if they snag at all in the loading process they tear and dont work.
1,Suck bee,I have owened and used many Nerf guns and decided to try a Buzzbee gun for once. Biggest mistake of my life.I tried to use this gun but the clip kept jamming. i returned and got two more but both had the same problem. I have to say once I got one to work I was not impressed. If you want a clip gun go with the Nerf Raider or the Nerf Longshot. Even the Maverick is better and it is a pistol for the same price.
3,Too much.,"I subscribed to AP for like 3 years, and finally didn't renew when I had a stack of magazines that I hadn't even read. Although I really respect the genre they cover, the format is just too much. I feel like they must mention 300 bands in each magazine, usually not more than a line of info about them. I think I would really rather they did really great in-depth stories about, say, 3-5 bands, and really focused on teaching their readers in a way they will retain the info. Also, I would be impressed if they included some articles about issues that matter to their readers like community involvement, the music industry from a business stand point, politics, etc."
1,Where is my subscription??,"I ordered this in mid-December for my daughter as a gift. It is now March and she has yet to receive the first issue. I've contacted Amazon, so we'll see what happens."
2,Poor,I ordered this subscription around the end of December and I still haven't received my first issue.
2,also still no product,I as well have yet to receive an issue its been over a month very close to hitting 2
2,still no product,it has been over 6 wks and we still haven't rec'd the first issue of the AP magazine
4,Decent magazine for those who are down with rock music.,"Mostly putting this review up to help it get a more fair rating considering that all the 1* reviews are people complaining about not getting their magazine ((HELLO AMAZON PROOF READER/person who approves reviews WHY do you continue letting those reviews through? They aren't about the product?!))now as i was saying. Decent magazine at a decent price.Proscheapentertaining reviewslegacy magazine that has been around quite a whileconsdoes feature to much trendy emo type stuffway way way WAY to many adsthat's about it.chances are you already have read or read this magazine if you are subscribing to it..but if you happen to be getting it for someone as a gift...it's aimed more at the ""kids"" than the adults."
2,The magazine equivalent of a hyperactive teenager,"While I listen to many of the bands AP covers, actually trying to read this magazine is exhausting. Their articles are short, never very informative, and usually consist of bands talking about other bands (Our influences are...). Also, they review what seems like hundreds of albums per issue, so each one only gets two sentences of space. Had a subscription for two years, but just can't force myself to slog through this magazine anymore."
1,Delivery Delay,"Why is it taking so long to recieve my first issue of AP magazine that was ordered on 11/27/09, it is two months later. I have never had a subscription to this magazine that would casue this to delay like this. This is also happening to another subscription I ordered on the same day. Any feedback would be appeciated.Kathy"
5,GREAT!!!,It is awesome deal and I'm extreamly pleased with my purchase!! I received my first issue less than a month after I subscribed!
5,Nice reading after the GoF book,"It's a nice reading after the GoF book. The GoF book provides more practical and easy to implement design level patterns, so I suggest you start from it first. After that, if you want to continue your journey in the software patterns, you should read this one. The first 300+ pages, talking about Architectureal Patterns/Design Patterns, are very good. The rest 100 pages are still interesting, but are a little bit light. Overall, it's a worth reading for software architects/developers. I'd like to give it 4.5 stars - well, 5 stars should also be O.K., considering there are so many quick & rush computer books on the market."
3,Like nailing jello to a wall,"I truly did not want to be critical of this collection -- as it contains many wonderful songs (with many personal memories attached for many Canadians aged 30 to 50 somethings. However, despite its attempt to group these songs by genre on each CD, for me, their still too diverse to hang together (i.e., be listenable). Perhaps I am just to attached to many of the songs separately... This set, is however, a very good introduction for appreciators of Canadian music, and people under 30...CheersPS. One more complaint. Did Celine's ""Titanic Song"" really have to be included here... jezzzzzzz! Holy smaltzy, Batman!"
2,Answering recording,The recording quality for the ansering feature is very poor. The sound is fuzzy no matter how close or far away you try to record from the speaker.
4,Thai noodles,They taste almost as good as a restaurant and I am going to order again but the Pad Thai to me was the best
2,Didn't like too much,I didn't like this too much. It was a bit too spicy and leaves a bad smell in the house after cooking it. I would have given it three stars though if not for the smell.
4,"very good, keeps you reading","The only negative is that there are a lot of French colloquialisms. Maybe I should have paid better attention in my high school French class, haha. Still a very good book though."
4,"A lot to like, but a major gripe","I agree with virtually all of the reviews, but I found the writing style incredibly irritating. There seems to be no word sufficiently arcane. Peers can only be confreres (and in italics), and some of the analogies are suitable for those with a doctorate in medieval history.Ironic given that Loiseau's was keen on presenting ingredients in their purest form."
5,Facing the fire....,"Mr. Chelminski paints an accurate yet heart-touching portrait of the late Bernard Loiseau, 3 star Michelin Red Guide chef. He draws the reader into the high pressure, high stakes world of haute cuisine and professional chefs to show us just how the world of first class cooking ticks.This is a fast paced, thoroughly enjoyable read for all foodies/cooks/gourmands. By all means pick this one up and read it!!"
3,Wow That Major Holley!,"Both tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins and pianist Tommy Flanagan play well on this music recorded live at the Village Gate in 1962. Hawk especially seems to be having fun as he playfully tinkers and toys with some of his solos. The standout, however, is the big stomping bassist Major Holley. He's a presence throughout and he's given plenty of solo space. An added treat is his hum-singing (I don't know how else to describe it) during some of his solos. Drummer Eddie Locke keeps everything moving and on time. Another treat is hearing Hawk's voice as he introduces tunes. This CD includes two welcome cuts absent from the original LP."
3,I would like to know the status of this as a first edition.,"I found this book at a sale and am interested in finding out if it has any value as the pages have not been cut and I think it is part of a set as it has Volume III on the spine. Also, it has listed several authors. Is the publisher ""National Alumni"" familiar to anyone? Just want information before cutting the pages to read it. Thanks."
5,"Useful restaurant and sake guides, fascinating bkgd info","The book includes two ""sampler"" guides: a sampler of 100-odd premium sakes (chosen somewhat arbitrarily, it seems, from the produce of the 1500-odd sake breweries in Japan), and a sampler of restaurants and bars in all large Japanese cities and a few large US and European cities where one can try premium sake. Of the two samplers, I think the second may be more useful. The average restaurant in Japan serves two kinds of sake: cold, and hot. This sampler helps those of us in search of real sake to find places to drink it -- an extremely useful piece of information.The background information on sake brewing was fascinating, especially to a home brewer; I didn't put it down 'til I was done."
5,"Miseducation:Preschoolers at Risk, by David Elkind","In the ""Questions Parents Ask"" section of this book Mr. Elkind is asked: ""So what is going to happen? According to you, we are miseducating large numbers of young children, so what does this mean with regard to the future?""Mr. Elkind answers: ""I have no crystal ball...My guess is that the teenagers of the nineties will be more neurotic than teenagers today. They will show more obsessions, more compulsions, more phobias, more psychosomatic symptoms than do teenagers today. ...What I cannot really predict is the extent of the problem.""This book was published in 1987. The preschoolers of that time are today's teenagers - the same teenagers who are bringing guns to school and killing their teachers and classmates. While I believe the causes for these horrific behaviors are manifold, I also believe Mr. Elkind has made a valid point, he certainly has my attention."
3,More than you think,"I bought this book in hopes of ascertaining the kindergarten readiness of my 5 year old grandson. The author was recommended by a retired school teacher friend. In fact the book was written in 1987 and much of the material is now dated. However, I found a fascinating prediction about the Millennials (Gen Y) young adults now entering the workforce. David Elkind accurately assessed how the education style and pressures of the 80's would affect children reared and educated during that time."
5,Nice Sandals-Many Compliments,"These sandals are fantastic (I bought both the black and brown CROC design). I get many compliments, especially living in Florida-They are nice enough to wear with light weight long trousers."
2,Fell apart soon after receipt,"My son desperately wanted a ""real"" rubber chicken. Within a week after giving it to him, it had split along one of the seams. My son doesn't mind and still plays with it. I am disappointed that it didn't last longer."
2,Can you get a broken chicken??,"I know it may sound funny that a ""rubber"" chicken could be broken but when I got mine it sure was. The seems in 3 or 4 places where it was put together were split and there was a cut so large on its leg that it's leg was barely hanging on. It's flimsy and lightweight and of poor quality materials.It also costs more to ship then the price of the chicken itself.It it had not been a gift I think I would have been very angry to have spent any money at all on this one.THIS TOY WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR A DOG! Even the smallest dog would have this ripped to bits in no time..It's just that thin and flimsy."
3,Cute but not at all durable.,I used a rubber chicken in my classroom as a prop to teach until it got stolen. Then I bought this one. It doesn't hold up with kids. It is already ripping apart at the seems. I doubt it will last the whole school year.
3,"Not bad, just not what i thought i was ordering","I must have not read the description properly, I was thinking I was getting the loud squeeky rubber chicken instead...So it has become a dog toy instead. But fast shipping!"
4,Classic Rubber Chicken,Great gag gift sure to bring a laugh! This product is a classic- durable and of high quality.
4,Weird whiteboy funk,"What happens when you take two Brighton lads into experimental music and then have them record a pop record? Super_collider is a good indication of what the result are. Jamie Lidell and Cristian Vogel put this one together, and it's equal parts bulbous techno sounds and affected white-boy funk, with Vogel providing the backgrounds and beats and Lidell crooning like an out-of-tune, out-of-time Prince. ""Darn"" is easily the highlight with its squirming bassline and tinny ""yeeeah"" sample cropping up again and again, but the whole album is a welcome diversion from the diluted electronic market."
3,Import version not worth the extra dough,"While I think this CD is great ""weird whiteboy funk"" (as another reviewer put it) do NOT, I repeat, do NOT think you're getting anything special with the extra tracks! Complete throwaway material, two substandard mp3s and a video. Buy the domestic instead, or buy Prince's ""Dirty Mind""...but to heck with the enhanced CD."
5,CLassic of classics,"I loved David gates when I was a teenager, and I still do. I am really glad they reprinted this album in CD. The quality might not be the best, but the memories are great!"
4,Creative destruction is the story of the universe,"In the late 1980's Progressives in the media savagely blamed Mike Milken for the loss of thousands of jobs while alleging that his purported aim was to satiate his own greed. The truth is a little different. This book, in setting most of its focus on the nuances of the political battle and not enough on the reasons for the war, does what the major media does when it covers a political campaign. It focuses on the tactics and the strategy and the back room internecine political conflicts to the detriment of the real story. As mentioned, the real story is something quite different. ..."
1,Boring and Misdirected,"Spurious, sensationalistic, and, yet, uninteresting--Bruck somehow manages to exaggerate an inherently entralling story to the point of abstraction and, ultimately, of flavorless moralizing."
4,interesting,"a good read, however it is somewhat melodramatic and doesn't explain the positive aspects of a healthy junk bond market"
4,The Dark Side of Wall Street,"This book is not only for the general readers, but also is a great read for business students - especially who are working hard towards becoming future titans of Wall Street. There are the glamorous side of the billion-dollar deals, and also the dirty side of threats, inside circles and the ""girls"" at the Predators' Ball. You always know about the success stories at cocktail parties - losers never get invited.I have no way of telling whether the research has been done in a well represented way, since Milken himself was not interviewed - he didn't want the book to be published. However, I am still very impressed by Ms. Bruck's effort and her lesson : in the end, there are no heros, just self-interest and greenbacks flying around in the little corner of Manhattan drowned in sunset."
4,Good background information on finance in the 80s,"This book is a great reference point to many of the activities that occurred in the 1980s and how those events impact Wall Street and the financial markets today. While not as well written as other books in the genre, it makes an emphasis of using facts as opposed to circumstantial evidence presented as facts (which many similar books such as ""Den of Thieves"" and ""Barbarians at the Gate"" use) and that makes this book a cut above the rest."
5,Good Book,I really liked this book. It was good on briefing myself on the era of junk bonds and the junk bond king himself and the origination of IO and PO strips for tax loopholes. I definitely recommend this book.
4,In the realm of natural language projects,"A Classic in interliguistcs! It is fundamental in the evolution of artificial language projects respecting the ""natural"" lexical and syntax properties of the human languages (specially the Romance languages as French, Italian and Spanish)."
4,"A nice ""little bit"" of true crime","This book delivers what it promises... a birds eye view from the vantage point of a true wiseguy's moll. Perhaps we can forgive Marilyn her rough edges and ragged opportunism because her british South london peigree gives lends her a more mysterious air than say.. Victoria Gotti's ilk.Apparently in Britain the ""great train Robbery"" hads all of the fame and cachet as say, the Brinks robbery or the French Connection case on these shores.The perpetrator- tha authors father.She's not too deep and none too modest and apologetic, which is refreshing- she isnt trying to whitewash her past and appear to be legimate and classy - that's a breath of fresh air. However, this is one of the books that you want to read fast and then throw out, you're not going to find any insight or wise adages from this riffraff - just an old criminal broad's tale."
2,Never showed up,"We liked the idea of this book, but it never showed up so we cancelled it. Just a werning, if you order it, it may never ship!"
3,"Interesting, but the methods are questionable","An interesting book for anyone who has ever grappled with balancing work and motherhood. However, Hays' review of secondary sources on family life throughout the ages reads like an undergraduate term-paper. Hays' analysis of child-rearing manuals concludes that while people are buying these manuals, the effect upon them is unknown. The meat of her analysis is based upon interviews with 38 women - a focus group too small to contain any conclusive evidence on the topic. If you are looking for a sociological analysis of motherhood & work, the rigorous quantitative approaches are just not there. If, however, you want an entertaining ancedotal book on how some women view motherhood, child-rearing & working, then this is the book for you."
5,VBScript 3rd edition programmer's reference,"The book is very good for me as a beginner and want to master VBScript , each chapter of the 21 chapters is centric , heavy organized and easy to digest material with alot of short code examples , tutorials and figures , and the book end with 10 appendices covering the book in a nutshell and act as a reference , what interested my in the book is Sidebar and gadgets programming , task schedular scripting , powershell scripting using VBS , window script host for windows administration like copying and moving files and creating folders and making reports and automated task handling and HTA scripting , before reading the books i did not know that VBScript can do all that ."
2,Good if ASP and COM are in your future otherwise.......,"I bought this book as a first timer to VBScript, but it just didn't clearly explain much of what I was looking for in a book titled VBScript. It didn't provide very good code examples and fewer explainations about the built in functions of VBScript. It gave an insight to VBScript's use with ASP and COM, but it neglected areas it needed to clearify better. It covered a lot of extras and not the meat of VBScript so I had to turn to other books for clear explanations and good code examples. If I hadn't had a college instructor this book would have been of little help as a sole resource to VBScript."
1,Index is Incomplete... Very Hard to find things,"I bought this book because there was nothing more recent and I figured it was a Wrox book so it should be complete.However, the Index is very small and incomplete.Very poor work. I could not find the Trim Function in the index and there are probally a lot more topics I won't be able to find over time in the index.For a reference book, the index should be very complete and this one isn't.The other readers are correct, you can't find Functions in the index.You should be able to find simple and difficult topics for a reference book in the index and this one doesn't fit the bill.Seems like this book was poorly edited and produced so it could make a deadline."
2,"Good Read, Useless for Reference","Like most of the reviews here, I liked this book. The information was presented well and the examples were good. Once I had read the chapters I was going to read though, the book became a bit useless. If you look something up in the index, it will send you to pages where the word happens to be used, even if it was only used in passing. It's like they used a vbscript word-search to create the index. Totally useless. The appendix that is supposed to be a reference is organized by types of things like file system objects, or WMI objects. This is great if you're browsing, but if you're actually looking for something specific, you're SOL. The appendix is not even covered in the useless index. Good read though."
2,"Whatever You're Looking For, It's Not In Here","I cannot begin to count the times I've referred to this book and closed it with ""I can't believe they don't have [fill in the blank] in there!"" Save your money to buy the O'Reilly (""seal"") book."
1,It's so bad. Never saw a reference like this. Just rubbish.,"When I saw the topic of ""VBScript Programmer'sreference"". I thought this just what I want.(so stupid Iam). Because I'm an experienced VB programmer, a reference seems good enough for me. But in this book, it's not only very difficult to find function, actually, they didn't put a lot of useful functions in this book. If you see the back of this book, they will tell you what this book covered. covered? or mentioned? 800 pages book, mentioned everything but useless."
5,VBscript Programmer's Reference delivers the goods,"In this day and age, finding good CURRENT books on VBScript is becoming more and more of a holy quest. In the last year, only two come to mind: this book by Adrian Kingsley-Hughes et al (Oct. 99) and VBScript in a Nutshell by Paul Lomax (April 2000).Well, I have both of these books. They are both very very good and both are very deserving of their overall high ratings.Even so, I find myself using the VBScript Programmer's Reference a bit more than the other book. It is very comprehensive, very clear and I find myself having to pull it off the shelf time and time again. It's that good.So, VBScripters out there, I recommend that if you only have enough money for two books on VBScript, purchase VBScript Programmer's Reference and VBScript in a Nutshell. I recommend that you buy VBScript Programmer's Reference first!"
5,"Great book, be sure to buy the 2nd Edition","This is an outstanding book. At first I was confused by some of the older reviews, until I realized that Amazon is still selling the old 1st edition, and many folks are buying that one instead of the newer, much better Second Edition.Be sure you're buying the Second Edition! That book's ISBN is 0764559931. It's the one with the picture of three authors on the cover."
2,Where was the editor?,"As another reviewer has noted, any book that has eleven authors is bound to need a good editor, but this one shows no sign of even having been looked at by a copy editor. Many sentences don't make any sense at all, the cringe-inducing substitution of ""it's"" for ""its"" occurs all too often, the first person singular appears inexplicably (who is ""I""?), and some of the code samples contain obvious bugs.On the positive side, there is a lot of information in the book, but the lack of attention to the text makes one wonder about the quality of the information as well."
3,Decent overall.,"Overall, VBScript: Programmer's Reference is pretty good and fairly useful.High points:- Wide range of relevant topics.- Good examples.- Extensive appendicies.Low points:- Already out of date.- Worthless and frustrating index.- Lots of undefined acronymns.- Discontinuity of writing styles between the many authors.I have been writing embedded software for a long time, but am relatively new to VBScript and Windows. I found this book to be useful for me, but I suspect that there are probably better books out there."
2,"Full of useful information, but...","The author never does address what skill level is necessary to fully appreciate this book. From my reading it should be clarified at the beginning that this book is not for beginners. Being new to ASP I found this book very frustrating to follow. It wasn't until page 51 did the author decide to inform the reader exactly how to 'run' scripts in Windows. From cover to cover I felt the book was organized poorly. However, if I was a more experienced programmer I think that I would better understand the book's layout and be able to 'fish' through this convoluted book."
3,Dips you in the VBscript pond & more (keyword dip),"A useful book for me, introducing me into VBScript quite well, but it will make you more of a 'Jack of all trades & master of none'. Each chapter gives you a dip into VBscript, HTAs, HTCs, ASP, and a whole bunch of other things I never knew about! Not a bad way to embroil ones-self into these technologies but not terribly in-depth. MSDN's site gave me more beefy examples I could use for my scripting needs. The reference section was OK at best. If you need a good warmup on VBscript and where it can live & do it's things, not a bad book."
2,Poorly Organized,"As informative as the authors try to be, trying to find any desired topic, in this book, is virtually impossible. The index is imcomplete. The examples are okay, but the book could be organized better. Too bad I couldn't recommend a better book. To be efficient, take the time to browse through the book and use small bookmarks to highlight the important sections. Personally, I've learned more and have been more productive with a good book on ASP."
5,Good book for starters,"I bought this book, as I wanted to write some simple VBScripts to help automating some laborious manual process for my job. This book is so easy to browse through and as I already have some knowledge of VB Programming and so I can easily browse through the chapters. Even for a beginner this is a good book to start with. I could start writing the scripts I wanted for my job and I like this book so far."
5,Misty Island Rescue,My grandson absolutely adores Thomas and His Friends. He had seen several commercials for Misty Island Rescue. He has watched the movie 10 times during the last week.
5,Great!,It is a Thomas and as always entertains my boy as expected. If you are new to Thomas then this is a very safe cartoon that doesn't preach anything accept friendship and doing the right thing.
5,I bought this DVD for a Christmas gift,"for my grandson who is 2 1/2 because ""Thomas"" and everything on Sodor, is what he's all about right now.So I can't really comment on Misty Island Rescue at the moment. I am positive that it will be popped into his DVD player upon opening it Christmas morning. Yes, he can fully operate the player all by himself."
3,"Not as good, but kids still like it :)","This installment of the new Thomas CGI character versions was just OK.Its the storyline and writing that's not great, like they really rushed the script through to capitalize on Hero of the Rails and get extra product out in time for Xmas. Its clear that HIT entertainment is fully and completely out for the buck like Disney, exploiting whatever life is left in this franchise.That's the adult view. The kids view? My son still loves it and its taken over the #1 spot on the blu ray player. Its all about the characters for him."
2,Confusing,"Unless you have a ""Gamer"" computer you will be disappointed. This game is a RAM sucker and a clocking hog. Frankly, I don't know who would allow their kids to play on a top off the line boxThe chapter play has no continuity. It plays like a an old bad movie full of flashbacks and dream sequences so that you never know which way is which."
4,great gift with toddlers,My grandson loves Thomas the Train. Amazon has the largest selection of DVDs.The DVD arrived in great shape and fast..
3,Super-annoying movie that children LOVE,"I don't know how to explain it, but my children LOVE this movie. Maybe it's that Thomas is so obviously steaming in the wrong direction, making mistakes and being prideful, but it works on a level that gets through to kids.My son got the movie and wooden Bash, Dash, and Ferdinand as a birthday present. The whole family has watched it.Torture for adults to watch, but the little ones LOVE it."
4,Thomas & Friends: Misty Island Rescue,"My kids love Thomas movies. They especially love the animated ones. Although Misty Island Rescue has a few plot problems, the boys don't care. I liked the film because Percy, the shy engine, has a bigger role in this one. He also shows us that he can be really brave to help his best friend Thomas."
3,An OK Thomas movie,"This DVD is ok. I agree with the other shoppers that Hero of the Rails was much better. The only thing that I liked about this one is that its a full lenght movie, better for car long rides that the shorter episodes DVDs."
3,Nothing wrong with the product - just makes no sense to have Blu Ray for cartoon,"Nothing wrong with the product - just makes no sense to have Blu Ray for cartoon. This is my VERY first Blu Ray, ordered over a year ago. The only thing I can say is, if you want Blu Ray, have a Blu Ray for a real movie. For Cartoon, DVD is good enough!"
4,Misty Island Rescue,This is a great movie. My son loves Thomas and Friends. He loved this movie so much that we purchased it for a friend of his for Christmas.
3,Beautiful Saw for the Dollar,"I am former finish guy, with his own buisness. I knew when i sold all my tools and trailer I would be buying another saw. For the dollar this is very good saw. But be patient, like any saw you should check it out of the box. I had to adjust the square to fence, table. I reset the miter guage, and had to adjust the bevel indicator, all normal procedures one should use. I was surprized how much power and easily to was to operate. The dual bevel was a bonous for the buck. For the beginner or the average woodworker I would suggest this saw. As far as Professional, It would be a good investment as a back up saw. Now its not a Mikita, or Hitachi, which I owned before, but it is a very good saw. One thing I did do is change the blade from the one they send with it, as it was a ripping blade, and I put on one of my own 80tooth blades. I hope this review helps people with there selection.....Rich H. Redding Ca."
3,It's okay,I've used it to remodel the house. I've used it a lot. The little laser guide didn't last very long. I have no idea how to replace it or repair it.
2,Crap in a bottle,"I purchased this stuff because a friend recommended it because I have a serious issue in my basement (where I sleep) with Spider Crickets, aka Camelback Crickets and Cave Crickets. I kept waking up with one crawling on me somewhere nad I eventually just couldn't deal with it anymore so I purchased this stuff. I sprayed the outside of my house, and in the basement, and surprise surprise it didn't even faze these nasty little insects. I even sprayed one directly with the spray to see if it even did anything and the cricket just hopped away, perfectly fine! uhhhh so frustrating. I would not recommend this stuff. The only good thing I can say about it is that it does dry fast, in case you have pets and doesn't leave a strong scent. Hopefully it's more helpful for everyone else and their insect problem then it was for mine."
4,It is super effective.,"Ortho Home Defense Max is a great product. Does not work on centipedes or hobo spiders, but they are weak against glue traps."
1,Ortho is a waste of money in my opinion,"I've tried this product outdoors to create a barrier for ants around my house and insided my house because we get them every year. (I have used the bait traps in the past but they are a little unsightly and tend to bring more ants before they get rid of any). I decided to start early this year before the ants had shown up and this spray didn't do one bit of good. I applied a thick line drenched in this poor excuse for an insect killer around the house, the ants still came. I sprayed it on them directly they died alright but as soon as it dried ants walked right over where it had been sprayed. Guess they left out the part where you need to constantly keep the area wet with this garbage. Oh and it's definetly not waterproof, the stuff just washes right off in the rain. Save your money try a cheaper product."
1,"You'll be lucky to kill a fruit fly with this, TERRIBLE PRODUCT !","Okay so I bought this recently & the same day I saw an ugly looking spider in my house. Well I go to grab this Ortho & I spray him once, nothing he just runs like crazy, I keep spraying him easily 20-30 times everywhere he goes, NOTHING! He slows a little bit, then after 5 minutes of spraying him, drowning him in it, he eventually gets tired I'm guessing.. So I smushed him. Then today I had fruit flies on some old fruit, I spray that fruit like 50 times throughout the day.. What happens? They don't die, I sprayed one fruit fly about 10 times he was STILL running through the liquid making a trail haha. Don't waste your money people please !!! BUY RAID IT WORKS IMMEDIATELY!! THAT IS A GUARANTEE !"
1,Sprayer design is dangerous,"I was spraying outside when the base of the handle split apart, the spring and plunger came out in my hand splashing my leg with enough insecticide to soak my shorts and run down my leg into my shoe. Could have just as easily gotted sprayed in the mouth or eyes. This sprayer design is dangerous!This insecticide does'nt seem to be very effective on my roaches or ants either."
2,Doesn't work for spiders,"I know the description says it works for spiders (excluding black widow and brown recluse), but I thought it might work if I soaked them with it. I sprayed my firewood shed with it until it formed a puddle, and wolf spiders and several other kinds were walking right through it as if nothing happened. I sprayed a black widow in a crack for about 10 seconds straight and it just sat there. I waited several minutes, and the black widow just walked out of the crack like nothing happened. I sprayed a wolf spider about the size of a dime directly in the face, and he held his arms up like he was in attack mode. Then he walked away. It may work for ants or something, but it doesn't work for spiders."
3,Kills on contact but does not create a barrier to enter,"It works like magic (only) when you need to kill the ants (even carpenter ants), but it does not create a barrier to prevent other ants from ""trespassing"""
4,The ant-terminator,"I love this stuff. I live in a trailer in West Virginia, and have come to believe that the hills are just giant ant hills. Every spring until fall the ants would take over. I tried everything, from chemical to home remedies, the best I could hope for was about a week of less ants. This stuff kills them, now it doesn't last as long as it says it will, but I don't care, because it works for about two and a half to three weeks there won't be an ant in sight. As for the bigger bugs, giant spiders and such, they don't like it, but a shoe works better than the spray, or just smash them with the gallon jug. However, ants were my biggest battle, and with this I finally feel like I'm winning."
2,Doesn't Work,"I've used this product for about two months with hope that it would work. Unfortunately, it didn't provide any protection and it just seem like the bugs were saying, ""That's all you've got?"" Pffhh. My current solution to prevent bugs from entering my house were to use Raid instead. I sprayed near my main door and the outside of my basement's windows and that seem to keep them off for about two to three weeks. Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this spray."
2,Not for fleas!!,"I had a light infestation of fleas after a dear pet died and bought this product to kill them before it got to be a major problem. I think the fleas did the backstroke then gave me the finger...it did not work. Needless to say, my light infestation got to be a big problem that I have not yet conquered.For the record, I only sprayed the concrete floor of my garage. I did this on 3 different days and the problem only got worse. I probably would have been better off mopping with hot soapy water. I don't think fleas can do the backstroke in soapy water.I can't say if it prevented anything else because I didn't have a problem with any other bugs.It got two stars because I liked the sprayer part."
2,What exactly DOES it protect against?,"For the record, I purchased this from Wal-Mart on sale for around $12. I needed it to spray around my new construction home because I've been having a pretty invasive amount of spiders and other little bugs coming in. I sprayed around the house and followed the directions to the tee; I even sprayed twice in some areas. And here, three weeks later, I can honestly say I notice no decrease in bugs. Spiders have set up webs, crickets hop, and other assortments frolic and play exactly where I sprayed. It's quite disappointing, really. I feel like I just purchased a jug of water. Be aware - when they say it doesn't kill black widows, they mean it. See the photo I uploaded for solid proof."
1,not as effective as in the past,"When we first moved into our apartment 2 years ago, we sprayed the outside and inside with ortho max home defense. It worked well then. Last year, sprayed again in February, March, and April. Spiders still came in. In order for this product to actually have an affect on spiders, I had to arm myself the the jug and spray the heck out of the spider before it would die. This year, the same thing. I even sprayed a small stream in front of the door after my boyfriend had to kill one. As of now, two more had entered in with in the past hour and he had to kill them the old fashioned way, with a shoe. This product is not effective as it used to be."
1,don't waste your money!,"Our neighbors recently moved in and then back out of the house behind us, and the roaches they left behind moved to our house! I used a whole bottle of this stuff, its been a month now and they have gotten worse! Unless you spray it directly on the roach it doesn't effect them!"
4,Great...for certain bugs,My bathroom was overrun with ants. I bought this product and sprayed it around the perimeter of the bathroom. Haven't seen another ant since! It doesn't work for every type of bug but for most it does an excellent job!
1,Does NOT work,The perimeter protection is a lie. The very next days ants and bugs are walking over the sprayed area like nothing happened. Do not waste your money.
4,"great west, just cumbersome on portages","do get trapped by branches on portages. Inside the boat it is great.more support on shoulders would not be bad, on portages to balance the load"
4,kayak vest,Lightweight. Vest runs on the larger side. Can tighten but end up with bulge on sides although not uncomfortable. I wish the shoulder area could be tightened like our other vest. Does not impinge on range of motion when kayaking. Would recommend.
5,The most freedom of movement ever....super light weight!,I love the PFD...there is no collar or weight on your shoulders or neck ...This is Great for Dragon Boat Racing..total freedom of movement and the price was great too. ...if you paddle at all this is the vest for you!
5,Kayakski,This is a very comfortable well fitting vest.Excellent quality at a reasonable price.I'm very pleased with it.
2,"I float, I guess","This life vest keeps me above water, I suppose, but it is way too big and unable to be tightened sufficiently, so it rides up to my chin."
2,Lets get a real review up here.,It's bulky. Shifts a lot.Defenately not good for boats where you will be sitting for an extended period of time.Very uncomfortable with seats that have backs on them. I used it in my seaeagle kayak for 4 hours and it was very uncomfortable. I'm going to look at a neoprene vest that has a lot less bulk.
3,Highway,"So...the Wilkinsons are back, trying to bring in listeners with a simular sound of country music, thank gosh there aren't an army of electric guitars like a lot of the stuff that's played on radio now. This album is good,..but since their music hasen't been released in awhile, it's new and different to hear wha they sound like now.I love the songs Inside The Lines, L.A.., Occasionaly Crazy,...those are the ones I'd say that are the most memorable, although all of the songs on here are great!"
2,Very fast tempo,"This tape is copied at a very fast tempo, unlike the original version. It is the original singer himself, just not the original songs."
3,"Very ineresting, but...","Very interesting, but...would be much more useful if the text/music of the actual hymnal were included."
2,Tiny reproductions,"If you have seen the figures in the book ""Hieronymus Bosch"" by Larry Silver 2006, you will be very disappointed by this book ""Pieter Bruegel by Philippe Roberts-Jones"". The reproductions are tiny, and you can not really enjoy looking at those figures. There are some reprints of Bruegel's paintings in the book ""Hieronymus Bosch"", and those are bigger and crisper than figures here. Yes, there are details of some figures, but not enough. This book might be the best book on Pieter Bruegel's paintings, drawings, and prints, from the reviews of other books on this topic, but it is not good enough. I wish there will be a Bruegel book as good quality as ""Hieronymus Bosch"" by Larry Silver 2006."
3,A Amazonian fantasy,The movie reeks of a school-boyish fantasy for sex. There is plenty of auto-eroticism and a storyline hinges only by the barest of threads- and you guessed it:they are on Bo Derek. The photography is good and it does give you a vision of the virgin landscape and you walk away with the subliminal message about the beauty of Africa. END
3,Edgar Rice Burroughs must be rolling over in his grave!!!,"Yes, yes, yes, this movie was a horrible depiction of the Tarzan story --- but MOST Tarzan movies are nothing like the book! When, for example, have you EVER seen anyone from the French navy appear in a Tarzan movie?!! It's NEVER happened! But if you read the book, a French navy ship is there to play a prominent role!Having said all that, Bo Derek STILL looks awesome, which is why I give this film three stars! And when those native girls strip her down and begin bathing her... YOWZERS!!! A HOT scene!!!"
3,A Bo Derek Vanity Piece,"This, like Bolero, is another ""vehicle"" movie directed by Bo's husband, John Derek, to display his trophy wife's--talents. Mind you, I loved the Bo-naked scenes: she's real pretty. But the rest, with Richard Harris' ""sawing the air"" performance, left much to be desired. 3 stars for Bo's bod."
3,What IS its intentions?,"I am not sure what this film was trying to be. Frankly, I bought it because Bo Dereek is in it, and she is, well, hot. The movie gives a veneer or cover, hiding this fact, perhaps. Like a best selling novel that hides ""the good parts"" in the middle of the book, this film is really just a device for us to ""oogle"" the wondrous Ms. Bo Derek (as photographed by her ex-husband no less). If you ""dig"" Bo, then you must get this film. If you do not, or demand a quality film regardless of the star, then save your money. There are some interesting plot twists, but the film is, frankly, just a ""white goddess"" film, with the obligatory sacrificial ""virgin""(Bo in whitewash), an ogre to menace her, the doting father, and so on. Again, if you're a Bo fan, buy here; if not, Amazon has several better choices for jungle films."
3,"Tarzan is Hot Suff,Man!","Geez!...I like Bo Derek,she's a total stunner but man that Miles O'Keeffe,WOW! .The story was,I suppose,was loosely adapted from the original Burroughs,but what a twist.I have to say both Derek and O'Keeffe looked just perfect together but that Tarzan in that tiny little loincloth was almost too much to handle,the body,the face,the hair not to mention the tan and the fact he does not utter one word throughout the entire film makes it even hotter.True the film is a shocker in the storytelling department but the fact is the two leads are just superb,the cinematography is lush and the music dramatic so,in my mind these things more than compensate for it so,in my book,as a gay man it rates right up there as a real erotic film without the obvious cheers!"
2,Tarzan the ape man,"...The only reason I gave this version of a remake 2 stars was because this movie has some darn good location footage. The guy they have for Tarzan had a good body, heck even a good, different style than usual loin cloth BUT his face was too prissy in my opinion. If you just want to see Bo naked and never liked Tarzan movies or hate Tarzan anyway, see this ABSOLUTE WASTE OF FILM STOCK. The 1918 SILENT far surpasses this gobbler even in total silence,without ANY noises or music to watch it with! Weissmuller's 1932 remake is superb. Yeah, none of the movies are like the Tarzan novels mostly but if there's copies of a book of THIS Bo movie, I'm sure it could be best used for trash can basketball or even for fireplace kindling. This movie is so awful, when it was in theaters, you could hear the PROJECTOR and SCREEN moan in agony!!"
4,Tarzan the Ape Man,Tarzan romps in his loin cloth. Jane romps in her birthday suit. Her father curses throughout. Beautifully photographed. Tarzan takes a backseat to Jane. Jane is stunning.
3,Tarzan and Jane review,"Pretty poor acting, but great photo shoot for Bo Derek. She was beautiful in this and the photography was great."
2,"Oh no, not another Bo.","This was supposed to by about Tarzan, but it ended up being about Bo Derek, who naturally steals the film with her flimsy clothes or lack thereof. Read the book. It's much better."
1,Pale reflection of the 1932 Original,"I saw this movie on T.V. a few years ago, and since then I have bought the original Tarzan MGM movies. This version is a pale reflection of the 1932 film. There is no smouldering chemistry between Bo Derek and Miles O'Keeffe. Her character moves from being an overly confident heiress to a bumbling, blushing little schoolgirl who is in a tizzy over Tarzan's ""Innocent/Natural/Virgin"" state. Her father, James Parker (Richard Harris) is portrayed as an outspoken, vulgar,sex crazed expatriate obsessed with the elephants' graveyard and any female he can find. O'Keeffe's gives a ""wooden"" performance as Tarzan.Three Chimpanzees and a lone Orangutan follows the ""Lord of the Apes"". If you are looking for a great performance by legends in the business, check out the b/w originals which for all their flaws, have lasted for decades. If you just want to gape at Bo Derek half naked, this is the movie for you."
2,When you expect little and receive even less,"I never expect much from Bo Derek, other than the all too obvious in the film, but to see Richard Harris wallow in this muck was too much."
1,Flat and dull,"This isn''t the Hellen Keller I remember reading about as a child. I know the book is part of many school libraries, but I found the characters flat and dull. I want more detail. These were fascinating women."
3,Beatles rule!,"Well, there's something this book has that others don't have. That something is every Beatles' track only available on the Anthology 1(such as You'll be mine, for example). But, it's not an accurate work, there are no tabs or other instruments' parts but guitar's and piano's. There's better stuff."
2,Didn't work for me,I am sure this would be a good product if it worked with my Ipod. Doesn't work with Ipod Classic.
1,Did NOT work for Video,"I have and IPOD Touch and I did everything that people told me to do to get it to work. I change the setting to the video went out and I tried other inputs around my TV. If anyone has any other suggestions I would really like this to work and NOT have to buy one from someone else. The audio works, but that isn't why I bought it, I wanted to watch my ipod movies on the TV. If you want this cable for music it is fine, but if you want it for Video DO NOT BUY IT!!! I would be more than happy to recount this statement if someone can help me get it to work. As for the time being I am disappointed and I guess you get what you pay for."
2,didnt work...,Dent work for my ipod touch even after adjusting tv settings. I could get audio but no video. Others have had.luck so i guess it depends on which ipod you have. Im not too upset though since i paid like 3 bucks with shipping. It was worth a shot
2,Works with Windows Phone but not iPod,I bought this cable so that I could use my iPod with the RCA inputs on my 2005 Dodge Caravan stock stereo/DVD changer. I cannot get the car stereo to recognize the iPod. The car stereo recognized my Windows phone immediately when I started a song. It played and paused nicely with the Windows phone. It did have trouble at first with the Right channel. I had to wiggle the 3.5mm connection a bit for that to work.I tried multiple iPods: a newer Touch and an older Nano. Both same results. I also tried all the iPods and the Windows phone on 2 TVs with the cable without any luck.I am not too bent out of shape since the cable was less than $4.It would be nice to use the iPods in the van though! The search continues.
2,ok,I brought this product because i thought it might be good to use for my 3rd generation Ipod touch unfortunately it does not and i'm stuck with the product.
1,bargain cell like china,bargaincell are sucks all of them products is made in china because not costsy and and its came like a pice of junk don buy if came from bargaincell sucks bargaincell
3,great for audio but not video for 4gen ipod nano,for a 8gb 4gen ipod nano it is great for audio but ipod still wants that wide cable for the video.
3,ipod audio cord,well i think next time i will spend a few more dollars on this product. when installed and listening to music there is an occasional crackling sound i believe to be caused by the quality of this cord. not too bad though for the price!
1,Did not work for 4th gen iPod Touch,"Product looks and fits well into iPod. However, did not work at all for my 4th Gen iPod touch. May work for others, but I'm giving it a 1-star based on it not working for me."
5,Works with T-Mobile Sidekick 4G,"I tried a number of cables and cable types since T-Mobile wasn't nice enough to document the TV-Out features. I couldn't get some other phone cables of this sort (4 conductor 3.5mm) or any of the micro-USB to HDMI adapters to work. However, this cable (and thus presumably, any ipod/iphone 3.5mm 4-conductor compatible cable) does work with the Sidekick 4G when TV-out is on."
5,love it,I love it and I use it all the time when I travel its great to be able to let the kids watch their cartoons and movies at night in the hotel room when kids are happy then we all happy
1,Not for the iPhone 4,This cord did not work for the iPhone 4 except for sound. I would not recommend this product. It didn't work with an Itouch 4 either.
4,I Pod AV Cable,"Great to see the movies on a bigger screen, but you need to play with the cable untill you get a good picture, and then sometimes during play back you need to move it again when the picture goes funny."
1,Total fraud,"This is not, I repeat NOT an ""Apple"" product as the product title would indicate. It is a generic audio/video cable of very poor quality. It will play the audio off of an iPod okay but doesn't even attempt to play the video. I feel totally tricked into buying this product. I contacted the seller to explain my dissatisfaction and they never even responded. My advice ... don't buy anything from this seller - ever. (and why can't we give ""0"" stars. This doesn't deserve even 1 star."
5,Excellent tool for ipod video,"just want to recommend to everyone this cable since you can watch movies trough your Ipod video without any problem, excellent video quality considering that you pay no more than $11 bucks"
2,Lesson learned,It wasn't what I expected. I can't watch something from my phone to my tv. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.
2,doesnt work with nano,"not only does this cable not work with my nano at all, the nano didnt even recognize that it was plugged into anything. Even if the cable was a bit finicky it would be ok with me but this was definately advertised wrong since it DOESNT work with ipods."
1,This product is titled wrong,I really wish I would of been smart and read the reviews on this product. I was excited to watch video's off my 4th generation ipod touch. and I got the paper with the cord saying don't give us a negative rating email us before you rate it. well that worked for like 2 emails and they stopped responding. so I give this a Negatvie rating..If I could It would be no stars.
1,Does not work!!!!,I try what was said to do and it still did not work. I says that there is something else need! I hate this product! I would never tell anyone to get it!
3,Didnt Work,"This didnt work on my Ipod classic. I read the reviews and said just to change the output to tv. So I did and this still didnt work. It was cheap so I thought I would try it. If you just want to see if it works for you, I would recommend just going to a Best Buy or electronic store and buying them there. Its just a pair of simple a/v wires with a plug on the other end. Nothing special. The seller and shipping went great and came on time."
1,cable didn't work - plain and simple,"YES, I turned on the TV-out feature on my Ipod 5.5G (video supported). When I connect the cords to the RCA on the TV, it simply doesn't work. All I get is a screen on the ipod telling me to connect the video jack, with a picture of the docking jack that belongs in the bottom/charging port. This does not work on my ipod, not sure how or why it is working on other peoples. I promise my ipod does play video and has the option for tv-out."
4,Great,"Love the fact that I can do everything from my laptop on my tv, but I can't hook iPhone to it. It's amazing for the price tho. The shipping cost more than the product! And it was still under $4 total!"
1,This doesn't work.,Bought this but....tried it on 3 separate telvision sets and it doesn't work. Wrote the company and they said 'it should.' Avoid this product.
2,Poor Purchase,My IPod Touch Did Not Work with this. Also i wish these wires came with directions because my tv isnt connecting with the wires.
1,your ipod is not compatible with this device,That's the error meesage that my ipod gives. I can't actually rate something that doesn't work. I ordered 2 and both gave the same message
1,Does not work with ipod classic I'm sending it back,I wish I had read the reviews this does not work with Ipod classic if you enable the tv out put it loos for the other connector the wide one at the bottom of the Ipod.
2,"Sadly, it died.","This cable worked great the first three or four times I used it. Then I started getting flickers in the video, and I had to play with it for a few minutes to get the picture to stay. Now it won't display picture at all. It still plays audio fine, but if you are using it to watch video, I'd go for something else. You get what you pay for, and in all fairness, I only paid a penny + s/h."
1,Mis-leading,"Be-aware, of the miss-leading statements in this ad, this product is for the IPod/I phone, but it's for music only, not video. There Ad, if you read it say for watching TV/videos, this is false. It's for music only."
5,Very very special !!!,"Extremely hard to find. I remember a friend owning this in the mid-1990's and unfortunately it got lost. Now after many years i've got a second hand ""Japanese version"" from a local music shop and now i feel like a very lucky Cure fan to own Entreat as it's so rare. A great recording from the 1989 Wembley concert it has most of the songs from the brilliant ""Disintegration"" album. If you're a fan of The Cure and don't own this i strongly recommend you hunt for it and be prepared to spend big dollars as it's so rare but worth every cent! 10/10"
4,A unique and useful book,"I am a polymer scientist and surface scientist. This book contains a lot of useful information about wetting, surface energies, surface modification and adhesion.Even more importantly for me is that it also contains special treatment of aspects not covered in any other book. In particular it has extensive information about transcrystallinity of polymers, how to induce it and it's affect of polymer wettability and adhesion.This book is not for everyone but if you want to know about surface aspects of polymers the I highly recommend it. I'm hoping there will be a new edition one day...Another extremely good book in this area is Polymer Surface Modification and Characterisation by Chi-Ming Chan."
5,Best book I have ever read!,I would recomend everyone buying this AMAZING book! I have read it a billion times and I have never gotten sick of it! Even my children love reading this glorious book!
5,Wow...,This is a really cool book. The story winds it's way into a huge knot- Salvador kisses Lizzy... and then he kisses Anna! It is a very intense story. The only bad thing about it is that the end just kind of leaves you hanging. I can't wait to find out what happens in the next book!
4,I LUV THIS SERIES!!!!,"I think that Salvador should get a life and choose one. I think Elizabeth should go out with Sal, and Anna should go out with Damon Ross. Jessica should go out with Ronald Rheece. I can't wait for, CHEATING ON ANNA, TOO POPULAR, and the other books to come out!!"
5,Favorite bra,This is my favorite bra. It is good bra for those who need a little extra support and available in a wide range of sizes
5,The Reference Calibration Disc,"Joe Kane's Video Essentials is widely viewed as the definitive reference disc for home theater calibration. It explains many of the necessary technical details of your home theater system, then provides tests to allow you to optimize both the audio and video sections, and explains to you why you are making these adjustments. Overall its very helpful, particularly if you take your home theater system seriously.A drawback is the relatively high price. If you are an enthusiast you should consider purchasing this disc and a SPL meter. If you enjoy home theater more casually, then simply renting this DVD would be a more cost effective way to go."
4,easier than avia,THIS TOOL DVD IS EASIER TO USE THAN AVIA THOUGH IT IS NOT AS FULL OF INFORMATION AS THE AVIA DVD. I OWN BOTH AND WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING A BETTER PICTURE FROM BOTH OF THESE I CHOOSE VIDEO ESSENTIALS FOR MY OWN TELEVISIONS BUT KEEP IN MIND YOU MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT BRAND YOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE A DIFFERENT METHOD OF VIEWING (I USE DIRECTVIEW [TRADITIONAL])BUT AS FAR AS THE SOUND CALIBRATIONS YOU GET DECENT HELP FROM V.E BUT REALLY GOOD HELP FROM AVIA BUT BOTH NEED A SPL METER(THAT'S A SOUND METER)THAT COST FROM $30 ON UP. MY OVERALL OPINION IS THAT IT IS A GOOD DVD TO OWN.BYE
4,"A ""gotta have"" DVD","I have the Laser Disk version (now out of print) and this DVD version is just as good. However, it takes a lot of navigation to go directly to the test images as they are not listed in the main menu. There is a new version coming from Joe Kane later this year replete with progressive scan programming, and I'm told this menu short-coming will be fixed. Let's hope so."
2,Should have taken the advice to rent it!,"I just bought a new Toshiba widescreen and Yamaha Dolby Digital receiver. I found this DVD informative but I only had to do very minor tweaking to my system so I couldn't justify the high price. I recommend renting it if your the type to ""set it and forget it""."
2,"Only If you Have a Need For This... Even then, Rent It!","For me, this purchase was a total waste of money... I have surround sound and a regular 27 inch Sony tv. I had set everything up well before even buying the disc, when I went through everything...nothing had to be changed. Now, if you have a serious, complex, advanced A/V system or don't understand how to set up your system, then this title is for you (even then I would still say, ""rent it""). If you just have a TV and surround sound (a ""normal"" home theater..no offence to you A/Vphiles) then I don't think you need this....again, rent it, if you find it is helpful, then buy. For the price, I think it is not worth it. This DVD takes advantage of the fact that some folks still won't take the time to figure out how to program their VCRs. Final Verdict... Rent It!"
2,"Too expensive, doen't have convergence for projection TVs","This DVD has good explanations of what it is doing, the use of the filter to set the color balance correctly was useful. Running this did actually marginally improve the picture.However, if you are a videophile with a projection TV there is one enormous omission: There is no pattern available to make sure the three colors properly converge on your screen. Incorrect convergence has a huge impact on picture clarity.This DVD is desperately in need of an update, it needs to take projection HDTVs into account. More attention to detail is required to get the best from the latest and greatest TVs and it just wasn't available here.As it stands this DVD is worth no more than $15. With a few more up-to date features (such as convergence) It'd be worth up to $25. As it stands I'm very dissapointed."
4,BUY THIS THING!,"Made all the difference for our 65"" wide-screen Mitsubishi TV. We had a tech come out and try to improve our picture, and he accomplished nothing. This DVD made things fantastic in no time at all!"
1,What a waste of money !,"I bought this DVD after reading several 5 star comments.After spending over 2 hours to adjust the system, there was absolutely no improvement had been noticed in both the picture and sound quality. Please spend your money on something else."
2,Did very little at enhancing my home theatre setup,Maybe because my theatre system had all the bells and whistles and didn't need to be tweaked.
3,NOT for the beginner - but a great workout!,This is a great workout but if you are a beginner and don't have well developed stomach muscles than I suggest you wait a bit. Almost all of the exercises are very hard to complete if your abdominal muscles aren't up to par. I would only recommend this DVD to someone that was already VERY established in a regular workout routine.
5,Great Basic Pilates Video!! Try it!,"The workout is fun and finish before you know it. You get so into doing it, watching your breathing and paying attention to your powerhouse that the time flys by. Kristin McGee is the best Pilates instructor I've seen so far. Only little thing... I need to stretch a little bit more before and after workout. Otherwise I LOVE it!!"
3,Good workout,"Good length, many options for beginners and advanced. I would recommend using a softer or thicker mat (than a yoga mat) for some of the back work which is hard on the spine if you are on a hardwood or tile surface."
5,Me Love Me Some MTV Pilates!,"I swear by this video. It transformed my body and my mind. I take it with me on vacations even. Kristee and friends outside Pointillo Mountains or whatever they are called? LOVE it. So beautiful. I've been using this since 2006. Haven't found a better pilates video yet. McGee is easy to understand and follow. Plus they give you three different levels to chose from. I love McGee's story by the way. Came to NYC to be an actress, sounds like it didn't pan out, so she turned to making fitness videos. But I recently saw her in a 30 Rock and was like you go girl! She got the gig thanks to training Tina Fey. See, in New York all your dreams can come true. Anyway, bottomline: great video."
3,old way,this is a good lookinto to the stollian school of db playing. bad recording and dull.still I'm happy that this is done. I admire stoll's bowing technique and this is a must for all you db's who play with the germanbow. still:the music matters and I cannot find it from this recording.violon is another thing.that is where I enjoy most of this recordings qulities.***.
4,"an upstate NY ""confederacy of dunces""","hilarious book, great characters and a solid evocation of Cooperstown's true character. (helps that i grew up there.) A worthwhile read"
4,The Complete Guide to Horses,"This Complete Guide by Mary Gordon Watson is for any horse-loving person. It is filled with lots of facts such as how the horse functions and moves, many of the diseases they come in contact with, and much more! If you want to know how to care for a horse or need information about buying one, this is the one to choose. It tells you what to look for such as weight, vices, temperament, correct symmetrical proportions, etc. The fantastic pictures range from small to large and are all in color! Also, they really bring the horses to life and help you to better understand the descriptions. This is an awesome book and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves horses!"
4,Very complete,This is a very complete book on horses. My daughter has spent much time pouring over it.
3,Another good package,"Yet another remixed CD from the Verve vault. This is one of the many CDs from the Verve-Jazzclub series. It runs in the trend of those Verve Remixed CDs and if you are into these sort of redefined dance versions, then please do not wait any further. Slip this in your stereo and let the music take control."
3,Iffy,Had it for 3+ years. Worked great until it caught fire 5 minutes ago. Gonna try something else this time.
1,Lasted about 14 months,Wasn't a fan of this microwave when it worked. It cooked very unevenly. Sad to say but I was actually relieved when it died after a little over a year. I was happy to buy a new one which should tell you all you need to know.
2,Good but didn't last,"We bought the R-305k version which does not seem to be sold anymore, so I'm reviewing for this one which I assume is the next generation. We really have liked this microwave and bought it because of the good reviews. But it just died after only 2 1/2 years."
1,Not made to last,Smoked the transformer after little over a year of light use. This is the second Sharp fried in two and a half years. I had a little Sharp half pint model that still was going after twelve years before we gave it away which is why I was loyal to Sharp. I've now bought the Sanyo 1000 watt stainless model which has great reviews overall.
1,Does not work - returning,I opened up this Sharp R-408LS Microwave with high hopes of having a nice microwave with all the advertised features. What a disappointment. It would not heat anything. Not even the popcorn feature worked. I packaged this right back up and returning for a full refund. I will not be purchasing another Sharp product. Don't these companies test these products before sending? I guess not!
1,argh,"Sharp R-408LS Family-Size 1100-Watt 1-2/5-Cubic-Foot Microwave Oven, Stainless SteelDied after 2 months. Very disappointing. Amazon customer service claimed they are now out of stock, but apparently not. hmmmm. Beware."
5,Mrs. Kici's Dictionary is the most accurate work related to,"Almost all Albanian Dictionaries published under the Communist regime period display the influence of that stigma, which was a bias against North Culture legacy of Albanian language written in TOSK dialect. Besides, they contain a lot of mistakes and cannot be considered as reliable sources. Although the scientific work of Kici has been tarnished during 50 year in Albania its value preserve the most significant core of Albanian language. The originality, richness of words and lingustic value, preserving the lingustic Gheg Culture of Kici,s Dictionary make it among the best for learning and comunicating between Albanian and English as well as understanding Albanian language."
4,Granddaughter enjoys,Bought this item for my granddaughter as she had the shoes and is thrilled with them. She enjoys watching her shoes in the movie!
3,Cute but shameless advertising,It's a cute story that little girls will like but it's also a shameless marketing ploy by Skechers to advertise their $50+ shoes for girls who will likely outgrow them in less than a year.
4,Kids love singing and dancing :),"First came the schoes, then the movie...both are huge hits with our daughter, and our son pretends not to watch the movie..."
3,Cute but all about the shoes,A cute storyline but overly pushing the cool sparkly shoes. Six-year old daughter watched once and hasn't wanted to see it again. This would have been a better Netflix.
1,Basically worthless.,"I ordered this for my nephew for Christmas. First off, the noise it's supposed to make when you bend it... well, it makes it anytime it thinks you might even pick it up. Touching it, period, makes the noise activate. Also it doesn't retain it's shape well. A few bends, and it starts to stay bent. After several more, a crease starts to form where it bends that doesn't look to be going away anytime soon.Just not a very high-quality toy, in my opinion..."
2,A bit over priced. Burnt after continual use,"THis product is better than most others but not great. I think its overpriced. For the price I'd think you should get some extra covers or something. It heats up well and feels really nice. Like another reviewer stated...it does have this distinct stink to it but I can put up with it. UPDATE- I started to use it continuously and then I noticed a burning smell. With continual use, it busted twice and I stitched it up once. After the second time the cover itself started to turn brown and eventually burned also. I will not buy this again. Very disappointed it didn't last."
3,Good for a short time,"I purchased this neck pillow, I call it a warmer, about a year ago. I read some reviews and I will agree that there is a serious problem with this product. The inner case that actually holds the flax seed is made from a thin fabric that will fail in a short time. It develops a small opening/split/tear and the flax seed will come out and then burn a hole through the outer cover. The smell was very bad and the pillow had to be thrown away. If you only, occasionally, use this pillow it may be fine but do you want to take that gamble?"
2,CD of Glenn Campbell Country Standards,"I was somewhat disappointed with the quality of the CD. I have this album on a vinyl record that I had purchased many years ago and had hoped the CD quality would be as good. Not sure how it was produced but it comes up short as far as quality of sound and also some of the songs seem to be cut short.Thanks,Mary Carter"
4,"Entertaining, documentary or not","Yes it is very likely a promo for the upcoming Night's film at the time. It is nevertheless good entertainment. Scarier than all of Night's films. If Night had been the real director of the documentary, I would say it was the best work he had done as a horror film director. The sketched portrait of ""Henry"", Night's supposed ghost friend, was really disturbing and haunted me for a very long time. Again, it is good entertainment, if you don't get too hung up on whether it is fiction disguised as a documentary and that it was the means to get more publicity for Night."
3,"Good, corny fun... with far too little actual footage of M Night","This mockumentary is pure cheese, and even without having read these reviews to find out the real ""secret"" of this film, its obvious this film was a pure hoax... but it's a fun hoax. Initially the film feels like they are painfully trying to stretch out minimal footage and interviews with Night, but as the mock-doc goes on, it's actually fairly fun stuff, in a cheesy X-files sortof way.The highlight for me was the interview with Night, about midway through, featuring Philly ""velveta"" cheese steaks and shooting pool. Night really comes across as a down to earth, decent guy, and you can't help but think that the ""buried secret"" of this film is that Night is secretly laughing along at all of the footage.Three stars for a somewhat clever concept, good corny fun, and for the sadly brief interview time with Night."
1,Absolutely Awful,"What is the point of this? This profile of M. Night Shyamalan is supposed to seem really deep and mysterious, as if Shyamalan is some great director (please, he made one decent film, MAYBE). Saw this on HBO and couldn't last more than 20 minutes. Who cares?"
1,The Buried Secret of M. Night Shyamalan,TOOO SCARY....ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ACTORS MENTIONED THEY HAD TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT WITH MR. NIGHT SAYING THEY WOULD ACCEPT HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS...WHICH ARE NOT CHRISTIANS....CUT TAPE UP AND THREW IT AWAY!!!
1,"A renter, not a buyer","The most intriguing aspects of this pseudo-documentary were the Sci-Fi Channel teasers. This is not worth buying but if you are a Shyamalan fanatic, its worth ""a rent."" It's hard to tell if this was intended as a spoof/satire/send-off on pseudo-docs like ""Blair Witch"" or a lead-in for the ""Village"". Either way, it was not successful."
3,"Yes, its fake","I watched the 3hrs documentary right from the start to end earnestly. I had never watched any show on any other channel with such an interest. Right from the start I had the feeling that it was a sort of brewing interest out of the viewers about the taleneted director 'Night'. But when I saw that particular photograph in the documentary, I started to think it was real. But after the show, I searched the reviews on the net.The reviews bolstered my views and some of those even guessed Night's hand in this. Incase it is true, it would have been fine if Night had made a film, instead of wasting his time and his fans."
1,Find this in the Trash don't buy it.,This Ego maniac Night guy seems to never tire of his face on a DVD. What a waste of plastic and packaging.
4,live and smokin,"True no documentation and not a lot of George Benson, but the piano player and the rhythm section are top-notch. Obviously stars in the field who an astute jazz fan might identify. This is a great set. I think the sound quality is pretty good."
2,Fun but not productive,"E. Jean is a fun and sometimes funny writer. But I was looking for serious advice: I want to find the right mate, not curl up with a book about it. I read a review in the New Yorker last month of a similar book called ""Find a husband after 35"", so I bought that too, which had a lot of practical tips and really changed the way I approached the search for a mate. Most of these dating books have some similar advice, but I think this other book I mentioned will get results faster."
1,"True, True but Unrelated","I am not sure which one is the greatest waste of money: buying her book or joining her website. Let's scratch ""joining the website"" because if you ""recommend"" you can be in for free. Everything in the book is probably true (ie how to catch the man) but keeping him it's just a totally different story, This book is great if you want to land many dates, but don't count on it to get married. The mere fact that you ""click"" with a man does not make him good marriage material. And for Goodness sake, do you really want to date a guy you met while opening a store door, just because you clicked? What about his background, character, income, and moral values? After wasting four months with their ""strategies"" and website, I took their best advice (where to find men) and went on my own with other book's advices and most of all with an open heart, and landed the man of my life in 4 weeks and married him within 3 months. Good luck to y'all single ladies."
2,ugh. . .,"There are some good points in this book,1- Don't make man-hunting your life. of course the book then tells you to do the opposite but nevermind.2-It's scientifically proven that if you click in the first few seconds you will maintain a connection.3-Be Attractive. Flirt. Use what you got. Don't be shy.4-Stop worrying about the ""future"" of the ""relationship""5-Go where men are.6-Feel good about yourself.Other than those points the book is complete jibberish and a waist of money. Her writing style is very silly and not worth your time. Sorry."
1,Memories were better than the movie!,"I purchased this box set because it was the movie that my husband and I went to see on our very 1st date back in 1991. We have fond memories of that evening and so for our 10yr wedding anniversary i purchased the set as we were taking a trip down memory lane to mark our special occasion. We put the DVD in, but couldn't finish watching it. The movie was really quite terrible, the jokes, if they can be called that, are so obvious and over the top it's bordering on pathetic. Quite a waste of money."
4,A legendary comedy.,There isn't a whole lot you can say about these 2 movies. They are probably some of the most ridiculous films ever made. There were times when I things couldn't get more insane. They did. To top it off they made a freakin' sequel. There are very few movies out there that will make you laugh like these. If that's what you're after then the Hot Shots double feature is a great buy.
3,"Enjoyable, BUT NOT in this set!","The title, once again, pretty much sums up my opinion regarding this set comprising two films that had given spoof films a huge boost in their time. The films have achieved somewhat cult status in the eyes of their patrons, and I must agree that during my first viewing I had found both of the movies (esp. ""Part Deux"") quite hillarious. But after that, I found that some of the one-liners (accompanied by Charlie Sheen and Valeria Goleno's facial expressions) got etched into my mind pretty strongly, while the gags kept getting thinner. However, even with these issues, I would have rated the set pretty highly had the films remained uncut, but for some strange reason the films appeared to have lost significant footage (esp. ""Part Deux"") in this set that reduced their value considerably. Therefore, the movies are recommended, but not this set. Get them individually, and have a laugh."
1,September in the Rain: 1939-1949,"Sorry. The sound quality on this CD is dismal. One doesn't expect miricles, but this is rediculous. On top of that, the particular versions of many of the pieces are not Shearing's best."
2,METRIC! not SAE!,"This is a beautiful set and was shipped promptly and as ordered. But it's metric, and will not connect with any SAE (""English system"") fittings/components. There was no warning about this; cost me several hours so far and will cost me more with the time and possible expense of returning it. (I live in the US.) Apparently metric is the default with Grohe, unless you are told different! Buyer beware!"
3,Missing Stem Adaptors,"I purchased this faucet directly through Amazon. I noticed another member made a comment about the parts being missing and was hoping it would be a one-off, but it apparently wasn't. So, just know there may be an issue with missing pieces and check that everything is present before your installation."
4,360 Degrees of Billy Paul,"One of my favourite voices from the 80's: Loved especially "" Me and Mrs Jone"". Great voice. Passed it on to my kids even"
5,"Excellent, up-to-date aid to quit smoking.","As a trainer of health professioanls and trainers for smoking cessation programs (Lung, Cancer and Heart Associations), I think this is a very effective self-help book for those interested in quitting smoking. It follows time-tested and proven behavioral change techniques, and has information on the newest aids, such as nicotine replacement therapy (gum and patches) and Zyban. - This book should be of particular help to those who have tried to quit previously, using only ""will power"" or ""gut power""- which for most of us, isn't enough. It also has lots of self-work that will enable the smoker to learn the unique aspects of his / her smoking habit, and to personalize the reasons and methods of quitting- as well as how to make the vital period after quitting lead to success, not relapse. - For the busy person or the one who has no interest in groups, this book can be a big help to make this attempt at quitting a difficult habit a lifelong success!"
5,The Past Definitely Repeats Itself,"I've been a big fan of Leavitt's work for years and find this book to be extremely revelatory in the way ""things always stay the same"". From eating disorders among women in the 1920s to views of women's sexuality and mental illness by male doctors, Leavitt manages (as always) to form a collection of compelling articles that you simply cannot put down. Sensitive always to inclusion of race and sexual orientation, Leavitt often presents work in areas difficult to find elsewhere."
2,This DVD that I bought was very misleading.,"I say it was misleading because the box had CC on it But there was no subtitle.To me this is very inportant because I have a hearing problem.I am 82 years old,and have bought many DVD.I was wanting to know if a buyer will be able to know when subtitles will be on a DVD.In the menu there was no place to set up this ."
4,Mormon Claims,"A good book to have a hard copy of, along with Cowan's ""What Every Mormon Should Ask"".Before purchasing, visit this link to look over the content of ""Mormon Claims Answered"". [...]By the way, considering that hard copies of the book can easily be found for less than $5 each, it seems outright robbery to me that a certain bookseller would offer this paperback book for $42.96 plus s/h.That seller, ""Bxxxxx's Books"", has a 98% positive rating over the last 12 months (919 ratings). Shameful.I have a bunch of books that are probably worth anywhere from $3-10 that I would LOVE to sell someone for $42.96 each, plus s/h!!!!Contact me if you're interested! ;]"
5,Nurturing Seeds,"Four ordinary women, one extraordinary book. Beautiful and sometimes humorous stories, recipes, poems, tips, bible references, and MORE make up this amazing book. Carry it with you to read on trips and in waiting rooms. Try a new recipe. Take it to bed, and find the nighttime reading that's just right. In the morning, begin your day with prayer, and a story to think about all day. This is the kind of book to weave into your life every day!"
1,Preachy and self righteous,"This is a preachy and self righteous collection of writings by Christian fundamentalists. They claim to draw on the mustard seed metaphor but when I read it, I did not see seeds of faith growing, but instead experienced a drought - true Christian love and caring are missing, and I asked- where is the joy?"
4,The Climb is worth the effort,"The Climb was every bit the thriller I expected and more. A very good message and a good story, well acted and thoroughly believable all the way. A great evening's entertainment with a message. Don't miss either one."
2,Not Quite What I'd Expect,"This movie was not what I was expecting based on the writen previews for the film. While it was an inspirational movie with a background message, it was not as involved in the actual climbing as other shows such as The Mountain with Spencer Tracy & Robert Wagner, the Third Man on the Mountain, K2, or Beyond the Void. All of these were more of a ""climbing movie"" than the above production. My suggestion to the potential viewers, if you want climbing action and footage, watch something else. If you enjoy ""feel good"" shows this would be ok."
3,The Climb,Movie OK. Not as good as other Christian movies though.Product box was broken. I guess hard box packaging would be better than plastic bag with air bubbles for movie shipping.
5,The Climb,It is a must for your library and is a great witnessing tool which I have already shared several times.
5,The Climb,Wonderful christian movie. Well worth watching! Two very different personalities and how Satan works furiously but only God can conquer!
3,Who's to say who's an expert on being 50?,"There was some good advice in here, or more accurately some vignettes. I didn't get much out of this book that I could apply to my own life. However, some people may find the stories inspirational, so I gave it an extra star for that reason."
3,Books,I bought this is a gift for my mother who recently turned fifty. She has not spoken about it so I don't think she enjoyed reading it. Normally she raves about the books I gift her.
4,Fifty Ways to help you get over being Fifty,"This is a compilation from various authors writing on the subject of turning 50. The first contributor really lays it on the line by saying ""Stop complaining"" and get your act together so that you'll get through many years after 50. I appreciated that these 50 writers ""provided essays on a pro-bono basis"" and profits from the book will go toward non-profit organizations focused on cancer research. This is a great book to give as a gift to friends reaching this sometimes challenging milestone."
4,Real metal screen repair,"I bought these to repair some holes made by carpenter bees. Apparently they are willing to work with screens, too.The best thing about this repair kit is that the patches are real metal screen material. Some repair kits are nothing more than plastic patches with lines on them. If you want to do a proper repair, I'd suggest these.The patches are easy enough to put in place: remove a bit of wire on either side of the patch, press into the screen and then bend the prongs back, locking the patch in place.The one downside of the product is that you just get one size-but these can be trimmed to fit."
1,Don't bother,"Admittedly I have only read Rising Sun and not Disclosure but one was enough. My wallet is eternally grateful that Rising Sun was so bad I have never been tempted to buy another Micheal Crichton novel. I found the book very hard to read and in fact I gave up half way through and just read the last few pages, something that I never normally do. I hate to say it but for once Hollywood made a movie that was better than the original book. I almost liked the movie. I thought that my ineptitude with foreign languages was the problem but when I lent it to a friend to translate the phrases for me, he said that he couldn't and they must be a dialect of some description. He is now working in Japan and speaks the language fluently. I lent the book to another friend and I don't care if he never returns it. You may think I being harsh but then if you liked the book you can merely write me off as that one in a million wierdo."
4,The edition to get.,"I wanted this edition because another one out there was reviewed as having inferior paper and cardboard.As I hoped, this one is has glossy paper, good hardcover binding and nice color reproduction. Hope that helps.Cool story and art, but I admit I am a biased fan of Kirby. To the uninitiated YMMV."
5,Large and heavy,"Bought it for my mother-in -law last Christmas and she loves this pan. She uses it all the time. It has held up great and is great to cook in... it is very big and heavy, but that is what cast iron is!!!"
2,doesn't make sense,"I bought this at Marshalls for $40. I needed it for a recipe and wanted to get a cheap french oven to see if I would really get my moneys worth out of it.( The good ones really set you back). Honestly, the pot itself is fine, cleans well. But why, Why?, would you put a handle that can only endure 350, on a french oven that can be heated to 500? AT first I said well it is for low temp cooking no problem. Well the second recipe I attempted needed a temp of 400, I had to remove the handle and ended up burning myself.The point is the handle ruins the pot, I wouldn't even spend $40.00 on it if I had to do it all over again."
1,No Quality with this product......,"I purchase this item because I love RR and I thought she would produce a good product too!!!! I was so wrong. The very first time I used it, the handle on the lid broke off. The insert that holds the handle on to the lid is way to short for the weight of the lid. VERY POOR QUALITY and not worth the money at all.....I was SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!! Would never purchase anything with her name on it again....besides nothing of good quality comes out of CHINA these days....the paint was bad too.....WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO ANYONE I KNOW.....DISASTER!!!! RACHEL, You should have had this item made in Italy, then it would have been made correctly......my two cents worth...."
5,Simple fix,Save a lot of cash over dealer cost. Had my indep. mechanic install them as I don't have a lift or ramps anymore and I consider myself lucky to get this fixed cheaply. Way cheaper than last time I replaced sensor.
4,Pre-cat sensor,"Note: This product is listed elsewhere as a pre-cat sensor. Nowhere in this item description OR in the as-of-now single review is that noted.The POST-cat sensor for a car that uses the ABOVE sensor (1998 E38 mfg prior to 8/98)can be found under '13475'.The two sensors are identical, but the CABLE length on the two is not.Bottom line: Do your research. KNOW that you are purchasing the correct sensor for your vehicle."
5,get all four Dolch books by Lee,"My daughter loves all four of the Dolch books by Betsy lee.The first 3 books have A Funny Dolch Word Book in the title.Her favorite (and my favorite) is ALbert the Apple Eating Appaloosa. We love horses and this is a really cool book.She can read it now without any help. She is really reading the words, not guessing at pictures or saying the pages from memory.She started with book one. That is the best place to start.Then you should use book 2 then 3 then you are ready for Albert.A funny Dolch Word Book #1 was the first book she could read without memorizing it or without guessing at pictures. It does not just have one or two words per page. It is a real story book. It does not have short choppy sentences. The sentences aren't very long but they sound like people really talk. It is really a great little book. Be sure to get all 4 of them!My daughter is in first grade and these books have helped her a lot."
2,Not a fun read,"My daughter is an early reader at age 4, and I thought she would enjoy ""funny"" stories with sight words. But the stories in this book are not funny. And my daughter did not find them enjoyable to read. There's another series of books, Sight Word Readers, that is much more readable than this."
3,Dissapointing,"I was disappointed with this book. It does contain many dolch words. However, the stories are dull and tedious. In addition, the book is flimsy - it is ""bound"" with staples."
1,Take with a truckload of salt.,"It's sad that legitimate bits of Zulu folklore are mixed up with von Daniken-esque rubbish. It's also sad that foreigners, especially in the African diaspora, have been taken in by the fraud. Mutwa is a skilled storyteller, such a pity he felt the need to cover his imagination with a veneer of fake authenticity."
5,Postmorteum,Very good and intend on reading entire series todate. Entertaining and makes you want to keep reading BUT also an easy book to put down and then get right back into it.
4,Page turner,An excellent read. Keeps you guessing. Just when you think you know who done it there's a new twist. Already starting the second installment for Dr. Scarpetta.
3,Very disappointing,"My bookshelf is pretty eclectic and includes a number of crime thrillers. I just finished the first Reacher novel and was looking for another ""first"". Being from Virginia and having heard plenty about Cornwell over the years I finally decided to give her a try. I was surprised to find this a remarkably amateurish effort. I gave it 100 pages before I finally had to give up. After 100 pages almost nothing had taken place. In a style that sounded forced, Cornwell succeeded in over-developing a number of the books characters and relieving herself of much pent-up angst...and that was about it."
4,A great start of the series,"Postmortem is a great start to the Kay Scarpetta series. Read this and I'm sure you'll be hooked for the series. Good mystery reading and leaves you wanting more, and there is!"
3,Precise Mystery,"At first I was a little disappointed because ""PostMortem"" started out like a Dean koontz novel,predictable and uneventful. but unlike Dean koontz. cornwell sticks to what she knows best. And that's forensics. The forensic details in this book keeps you interested, other than that it's just another mystery novel. Cornwell keeps the reader hooked by introducing a simplistic plot but incorporates the details in the forensics investigation and police investigation. No unneccesary supernatural events or meaningless relationships, everything in this book is precise and to the point. A definite page turner."
3,Unusualy Griping...,"I would have to say that this book scared me to my last wit. I had to check my windows before I went to bed. The only thing I didn't like was the slow turn it took in the middle, it almost lost me. The foreshadowing was so strong, but it jerked you around in only two pages. You think you have it all figrued out and then.... BOOM> Overall, You feel this sadness for the victim's. I wanted to stop reading it but couldn't put it down. Unusualy Griping...."
1,BORING!!!,"I found this book so boring, I wanted to stop reading! I just couldn't believe that I had actually wasted my money on it! I guess that if I have to say something positive about it is that the last 100 pages was the only part worth reading."
5,Classic Cornwell,This is her debut novel. It has won several awards. Mystery novels just dont get better than this.
4,Not too shabby...,"When I first bought this book, I thought it would be a classic hack and slash type of story. But after the first few chapters I realized that it definetly had more going for it. The story is about a medical examiner, Kay Scarpetta, and the recent serial stranglings that she is working on. It has politics, emotions, and a very clever killer. Although Kay's hunches usually lead her in a very large circle, it constantly keeps you on your toes. The ending was a little abrupt for me, but it didn't make the book any less wonderful. Overall, Patricia Cornwell succeeded in creating a very realistic and suspenseful story."
5,Terrific!,This book was great. I can't wait to read the other of Ms Cornwell's books. I love her attention to detail and acuracy. Lots of surprises. Well crafted. I actually took my son to the mall and READ instead of shopped. I never thought that would happen. I couldn't put it down!
4,Good escape read.,Very slow start but very fast paced ending. I don't think I will be a big fan of her writing.
4,Good read,"I am new to the Scarpetta series, having read the last one first. I wanted to start at the beginning, and I wasn't disappointed. The forensic science is fascinating, and Scarpetta is an intriguing character. I am eager to read the next in the series. If you are going to read Cornwell's Scarpetta series, I recommend starting at the beginning, so you can see the characters evolve."
3,What do the murdered women have in common?,"Unlike many novels about serial killers, this one starts at murder #3, and gets you right into the action and disturbing questions early. What is the mysterious sparkly substance found on each dead woman that appears only under laser? Whose finger prints are those on victim #3's shoulder? Why does the killer strike just after midnight on Friday nights?The plot is solid and contains more than a few twists and red herrings. The story is told only from the viewpoint of Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Richmond, Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner. The book does not contain any direct information from the point of view of the killer, and no flashbacks -- a fairly easy plot to follow. There is some discussion of computers, but total comprehension of the details is not necessary to understand the plot.Not her best work, but a solid read. Buy it used and enjoy."
3,"Good, but why are all the Black characters stereotypes?","The plot is riveting. The crimes are brutal and gruesome. The forensic science is fascinating. The Black characters are shallow, auxiliary, and stereotyped. It reminds me of Gone With the Wind. Here's an example:""As I followed him back out of the radio room, he tossed over his shoulder to a young, nice-looking black communications officer, 'If you see Cork, I gotta message for him.''Shoot,' the officer said with a yawn.'Tell him he ain't driving no eighteen-wheeler rig no more and this ain't Smokey and the Bandit.'The officer laughed. He sounded exactly like Eddie Murphy""Seriously, Patricia? That is totally lame."
4,"Scary, but good","This is a great book -a classic Scarpetta. This was the second Patricia Cornwell book that I read and I enjoyed it more than her second book. The only downside was the storyline involving someone sabotaging her work - just not believable enough. However, the rest of the book was credible and the plot unwound with sufficient tension. Just don't read this book when you are alone in the house at night!!!"
5,Excellent!!!!!!!!,I LOVED THE BOOK!!! I first read it when I was 11. I have since read it over 1/2 a dozen times.It was the first book I ever read of Cornwell's.I found it by chance and I am not sorry i bought it.It is one of PC's best books.Its what made me a fan.Great read!!I love how you get to know the characters. I got totally lost in the book as if i were there.Its wonderful.
4,An excellent crime thriller,"Dr Kay Scarpetta has a difficult job on her hands investigating a series of horrific murders where the victims are all well-heeled young women. All of them are found naked, bound and strangled in the early hours of Saturday morning.As she unravels the forensic clues with the brash detective, Pete Marino, her task is made even more difficult as it appears that legal officials, who should be on her side, suspect her of compromising evidence and leaking to the press. The case is made even more complex when it appears that her ten-year-old niece, Lucy, has become involved. To cap it all, it looks like the perpetrator could have inside knowledge of the investigation.The reader is kept guessing almost to the very end of the book. The suspense is never-ending. That's the way that a good crime thriller should be, and this is one believe me!"
3,Postmortem,"A gripping novel since start, the killing narrations were brital however the climax was unsatisfactory. Expected more on the details on postmortem but the novel hardly had any. Ya would recommond"
3,Postmortem.,I thought the time-line could be hard to follow at times and Marino's poor grammer was much over done. Of course Postmortem was written before much of the new phorensic science was developed.
4,A must for forensic mystery fans,"We all became experts in forensic detective work during the O.J. Simpson trial, so I was amazed so little was done 10 years ago in that field. The poor Doctor has to wait months for DNA results and encounters all kinds of barriers in terms of the credibility of her work. The equipment is so out of date its funny. Still, good ol' police work does the trick. The book is easy to understand, even if you know nothing about forensic medicine, and it it well written. Give it a try, it may make a believer out of you!"
1,This is a sappy woman's book.,"After hearing great praise for the works of Patricia Cornwell, I enthusiastically picked up ""Postmortem"" expecting a Thomas Harris or Michael Connelly like read. I haven't been more disappointed in a novel in a long time. The focus seemed to the relationships of the main character, Kay Scarpetta, not the crime and investigation. Big disappointment for this male reader."
1,Angry woman.,"Scarpetta is some angry and tormented women inside. Her resenment and anger actually detracts from the narrative which is not that interesting anyway because everybody is one-dimensional. I used to enjoy Cornwell's, but not anymore. (I can't believe I even like the latter book in which Scarpetta was even angrier!) She relies on a lot of technological gizmos (including computer) which seems dated in the year 2000 (the book is originally published in 1990). Other than one angry woman, cookie-cutter characters and technological hoolaballoo, there is not much to this book."
1,Too horrible to be forgiven,If you can read this book without nightmares afterwards I think that you should seek medical aid. I read as far as the description of the first murder and gave up but it was too late. It is the case that all of us may die equally gruesomely by accident or of natural causes. This doesn't make it more acceptable that such scenes should be relished. Better never published or even written.
5,LOVED!!,"From the moment I started this book I couldn't put it down! It was thrilling and kept me in suspense. I can not wait to complete the series. The book gave me the paranoia effect on me that a good scary movie has. When I say that I mean I was checking my windows to make sure they were locked, and trying to figure out ways to make my home safer. The thing that makes this book so chilling is that is seems so realistic and is extremely well written."
4,3.5 to 4 Stars,"This is the debut novel of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series. It is the first of the series that I have read, yet it is difficult to judge the book because of its subject matter. Scarpetta is a the Chief Medical Examiner for Richmond, VA. The book was published in 1990, hence it's coverage of forensics and computers is hopelessly dated. Dialing up to a mainframe? DNA is only recently being used. Perhaps this book would have read better in a pre-CSI, pre-Crossing Jordan world. Also, the whodunit isn't revealed until the end, leaving the reader without a chance to figure it out. The 'whodunit' is more of a 'howdunit.' That is to say about all to figure out is how the killer came across his victims.Regardless of the flaws of the debut novel, it is a long running series and I plan to read more."
3,Forensic Mystery,"Dr Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia, gets involved investigating a string of murders. However, while 911 was dialled, no one came. Read it quite fast, admittedly in front of the cricket, so my concentration wasn't entirely up to standard. I've read other Scarpetta novels, but I don't remember niece Lucy being only ten years old. (B)"
4,"serial murderer, politics, and technology","I really liked this book and plan to read more from Patricia Cornwell. The main character is new to her position as medical examiner and a serial killer is on the loose. Political careers are at stake and some are in need of a scapegoat. The main character is using forensic technology to find a killer before he strikes again, while security is being breached by someone breaking into the computer system (who, the murderer, a political enemy or an overzealous reporter?). Press leaks may jeopardize the case even if the killer is caught. The subplots are great and the action continuous. While I am not thrilled at the last second entrance of the killer, I am pleased to read a book with an ending that wasn't given away in the first three chapters. I plan to read the entire series."
3,All but the ending,"If this book had a better ending, I would have given it a solid 4 stars. The characters are interesting, the interaction between them is great. The detail, all there without slowing the story down. I was very pleased with the story all the way up till the end. It was like she was rushed all at once. I mean you get this well written, well told story, one that keeps you on the edge of your seat through a couple hundred pages. Then all at once it's over.Well if your a mystery nut you really should read this book. Just go in with an open mind and realize that the ending is going to a little quicker than you expected"
4,A Gripping Read!!,"This is by far the best novel written by Patricia Cornwell. It was gripping right to the end, keeping you turning the pages for more. Not for the sqeamish though - the detail of the gruesome murder scenes sends a chill down your spine - A definite must!!"
2,the killer smells funky,I do not understand all the hype for this writer. The plot is okay but not great. What motivates the killer? The characters are lame. Boring forensic details take up too much of the book.
2,didn't enjoy,"This is my first and probably last Cornwell novel. The plot is too minutely detailed in some parts, but the absolute worst part of this book is the identity of the criminal. I read up to chp. 11 and then quit. Sorry Ms. Cornwell, but this novel really doesn't have anything to say, and it doesn't entertain."
4,Pretty Good Mystery,"I just ran across Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta after finishing Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone series and feeling like I had lost a best friend. I listen to books on Audio CD. Getting used to the narrator, CJ Critt, took some time. Once I got past her voice and fell into the mystery, I realized that I could enjoy this author, too. I look forward to many more hours with Dr. Kay."
4,who do you trust,"In postmortem we first hear of Kay Scarpetta who has to stop a killer who kills for reasons the only killer knows. And leaves no clues. The book is very fast in the opening then slows down, but still makes you want to find out who really the killer is. Kay must deal with her own problems in and out of the job. From working with a cop named Marino and her niece Lucy. And a nasty reporter. Who wants to really know it all. Who is this nobody killer? Read to know."
4,Great Start to a Great Series,"I am a late-comer to this series, this first entry having been originally published in 1990. A friend of mine kept recommending Patricia Cornwell to me and I finally bought this book to start and I am glad that I did.This is more of a police/medical procedural than a classic mystery. Dr. Kay Scarpetta is the Chief Medical Examiner in Richmond, VA and is working with the police to find a serial rapist/murderer. Along the way, her office is implicated in some leaks to the press and she must deal with her boss about that in addition to the stress of the case itself.The action is plotted at a nice pace, some of the details are graphic (as in Kathy Reichs' series), and the ending is exciting to follow. There are not many writers today that can truly make the reader nervous and Ms. Cornwell did that for me.Looking forward to buying and reading the next in the series soon."
4,Better if read before more current books,"Since I couldn't get my hands on this book first, I made the mistake of reading the next 5 (in order, fortunately) before reading this one. If read out of order, this book simply isn't as good as Ms. Cornwell's later work, although it is definitely worth reading."
1,wrong way to start,slow to start and boring. not worthy of reading whole book. follett is much more entertaining. do not waste yor money on this book
3,"They tried, but I'd rather read the book.","Maybe I was wrong, I read the book before I listened to the tape (only a die-hard Scarpetta fan does that, I think)and as a result, was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the story is as on-the-edge-I-am-waiting-for-the-conclusion-with-bated-breath as the others, but although Ms Crouse is to be commended for trying to give a fine performance, inthe end, who can compete with the power of the imagination? Get acquainted with the novel one way or the other, butpersonally, I'd rather read."
2,blah,"cornwell just doesn't write very well. give me johnathan kellerman, pd james or elizabeth george any day, she doesn't hold a candle to any of them. maybe they're dumbed down so they'll make the best seller lists. or maybe she just churns them out for the money. oh well, guess she's laughing all the way to the bank."
5,UPS Guy's Take...,"The mock turtle neck cold gear are the best for freezing temps... but they are tight. Very flexible, warm, at times itchy, and I won't go to work without one... I spend 40 plus hours a week outside. Trust me when I say you will need another layer over top.. not that I'm out there in just this shirt, but if you have a short sleeve shirt and long sleeve Under Armour, your lower arms will freeze as air cuts through it like a knife. Hope this helps anyone shopping!"
2,Too tight,Too tight. I thought I ordered a loose fitting shirt but got a tight fit. Shirt itself would have been okay.
2,Skin tight,Everything I wear is extra large and it fits fine. With this thing extra large is so skin tight I can hardly breath. I will never order another one.
3,Cold Gear Longsleeve Mock,"I gave this product 3 stars for one reason: the color is NOT what I ordered. I ordered PURPLE; I received what looks like an odd navy blue. The whole purpose for ordering purple was to match a team uniform. Although the UA tag had a purple strip to indicate the shirt was purple, it was not. I'm guessing it was a factory second because of the color. I will choose another vendor -- UA directly -- to ensure I receive the color I expect."
1,"Horrible - when I add the product in the shopping card and on the order, it does'nt specify the size ordered!!!!","Horrible Display on Amazon shopping cart and order receipt!!! - when I add the clothing in the shopping card, it does'nt specify the size selected!!!! Also, on the order receipt, it doesn't specify it either. Why is it not included?"
2,mens under armour,I ordered this mens under armour for a christmas gift. I cant say for sure that its a knockoff..but its defintily nothing like the one I got last year at Bass Pro Shop. Seems to be good tech material tho-if ordering get a size up from what you`d normally get. I returned and went back to Bass Pro..slow to refund...
2,Not so great,"Was not very happy with this shirt. The first thing I did'nt like was that the sleeves were too short. I tried a medium and large and both were too short. The medium fit my body right but not the sleeves. The large was a little big on my body but the sleeves were still too short. I did'nt think this was very warm either, possibly because I'm used to the compression which is tighter. Overall, if the sleeves weren't so short it would be alright. I returned it and ordered a compression crew which I'm extremely happy with."
5,gift,this item was purchased with the bottoms that was also the same brand to keep him warm while hunting in the cold.
4,Nice!,I got this Compression top to wear as a base layer for when riding my motorcycle when its still cold outside. Works great for that purpose. Wicks sweat very well and I'm happy with my purchase. First under armour item I have ever purchased and feel the quality is very good. Kinda pricey but you get what you pay for!
3,Good Version of Handel's Gideon,"I enjoyed Gideon. I'm partial to the arias and choruses in Gideon. I think Handel's oratorios ""Messiah"" and ""Sampson"" are his best."
1,empty,I guess I must be missing something. To me this movie lacked any kind of climax or any kind of satisfaction at its conclusion. I liked the eerieness and the creepy music though. This reminds me of Flowers in the Attic but its missing a real point. Good directing but a lifeless script. This movie has no purpose.
1,the bored audience suicides,"The Virgin Suicides was recommended to me by someone who by all means should be dead right now. I don't understand how all these arty film school rejects can praise this movie so much. The only arty thing this ""film"" achieves is an entire new level of monotony. Even the music is boring in this movie. You'd have to shoot me with elephant tranq to get me to watch it for a second time."
2,Read the book!,The Virgin Suicides is an excellent book that was made into an okay movie. Kirsten Dunst and Josh Hartnett were horrible choices for these characters and pretty much guarateed that the movie could not be taken as seriously as the book.
4,A Narration Beyond Words,"I believe the key to this film lies in its subtlety. It does not feed you the story detail by detail; the movie opens a window into the lives (and deaths) of the Lisbon sisters. It is not a fast paced movie; it's not supposed to be. Growing up is a painfully slow process, and being trapped in time by an ununderstanding mother only inhibits it more. The cinematography and narration are what makes this movie, more than anythign else. The choice of colors and the tone of the narrator really highlights the underlying sadness and meaning of this film. The narrator's words are incredible, and if you appreciate good language, watch this movie for that, if for nothing else. Although you may not like or understand the story, it is extremely well told and beautifully done."
5,An Absorbing Tale About The Loss Of Sexual Innocence....,"With appealing performances,a haunting soundtrack by French band Air and excellent direction from Sofia Coppola, ''The Virgin Suicides'' stands as one of of the best films of 2000!Why it was left out at the Oscars is beyond me!The first time I saw this film I felt that it had an unsatisfactory conclusion but after multiple viewings, I thought the ending made perfect sense.P>Apart from minor flaws, this movie can only be described as excellent, beautiful, touching, haunting, magnificent! A True Masterpiece of film making!!"
4,What do over-protective parents lead to?,"That was my first question after watching this movie, but I don't think it was the main focus for the movie. Even though the movie starred two well-known actors, James Woods and Kathleen Turner, the focus did not lie with them but with the daughters. Just as the boys of the neighborhood are bewildered by the enigma of these daughters across the street, you may find yourself just as bewildered after the film has concluded.Although there are a few sisters, the bulk of the story is on the sister played by Kirsten Dunst. This is more than a film about teen angst. Plenty of incidents through the movie suggest it, but I believe the parallel lies between the sisters and the tree they try to save.Even secluded, the sisters are still somehow connected with the boys of the neighborhood and the neighborhood itself.This a very moody and difficult film, but I would recommend watching it."
5,"Great Product, Quick Delivery",This item was shipped quickly and it was a movie my daughter wanted so it made her very happy! I was pleased with the service I received.
5,The Virigin Suicides,Was delivered extremely fast came in great condition and the quality of the movie was very impressive I would definitely buy from this company again and recommend it.
2,No need to Suicide,I get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide!? The one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night. Why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself!?!? It is not matching the character?
1,!!! Extremely Weak Movie !!!,"I was really tricked by the recommending reviews I read here that made me buy the DVD. And oh it turned out to be as follows:1. Cheap budget movie.2. The story events are so weak with no goal.3. Terribly weak directing job (turned out it was the director's first trial)!4. The actors were teens who couldn't do a better job because of the weakness in the story and the directing.5. Oh and the sound track... don't hold your breath!When the movie ends (and after you over come your anger), you know that if the story was told differently and filmed by another director... maybe, maybe then it would've been better!"
1,So very boring,I saw this four years ago and still remeber how bad it was. It is that bad.Sofia Coppola is likely the least talented director ever. Not sure what a director does but Sofia's movies are awful.
1,no point to this movie,"you already know from the title that the girls commit suicide. you think that the point of the movie is to give you some insight as to why they did. the movie definitely didn't do that. you never get to know any of the girls. not really even kirsten dunst. you have no idea why they did what they did and how they felt about the boys who were trying to help them. its a pointless movie. josh hartnett was the only good character cause he had a sexy wig on and he looked hot. other than that, it was just a horrible movie."
4,"*a mysterious, bizaare, and almost dream-like movie*","a mysterious, bizaare, and almost dream-like movie, about five beautiful teenage sisters, how they'd changed from seemingly perfect and happy young girls with bright futures ahead of them, to four doomed young girls who'd seemed to choke on the intoxicated air that their youngest sister had left behind for them after she'd commited suicide, and the boys who were obsessed with them. it's based on a book by jeffrey eugenides. it takes place in michigan, in the early sixties. fantastic music from air (air's score was just as good as the movie) one quick warning that may have been stated before- this movie is not for everyone."
4,Good adaptation of the book,"Sofia Copola does a wonderful job directing this film. The book is very dreamlike and full of poetic language - the sort of stuff that often does not translate well into film. However, viewing the film and reading the book, you see how she translated some of the intangilbe qualities of the book and translated them into the film; while leaving still leaving us room to use our imagination. The film is very dark, surreal, yet keeps you captivated by its youth and wonder.Kirsten Dundst was wonderfully cast in her role. I know that the other sisters had much smaller roles, but I don't think that they were cast as well. We know that the boys are drawn to them, partly by their mystique, but it would have been better to have girls that looked a little more alike and who could have captured more of the mystique."
1,"If you read the book, don't watch the movie",I don' understand how people who have read the book can praise this movie saying that it follows the book so accurately. It doesn't. And I can understand why those who panned the movie without having read the book can do so. The movie was an atrocity. Nothing like the book. I'm on the fence about the book but it certainly made more sense than the movie. So much was missing.
2,Success in theory. Failure in delivery.,"This film might have been good... but wasn't.It is a true failure of delivery. It's clumsy and overstated... but endearing in theory; Kind of like 'Harlod and Maude' in that sense. I can't blame fans of this movie for wanting to like it.Fans of this movie tend to be fans of this genre, and therefore excuse the poor direction and pacing.Bottom Line: Another filmaker could have done much better with the same material.Sofia Coppola is apparently still learning during the making of this film. Air's soundtrack has many more memorable moments than the movie itself.A good effort though. Coppola did much better on 'Lost In Translation'.'The Virgin Suicides' feels like 'The Royal Tennenbaums' if it lost its sense of humor and was insincerely directed by young a hack."
5,Haunting,"I'm not sure whether it's Kirsten Dunst's acting, the tragic story line, or the song ""Playground Love,"" but I find this movie haunting me long after I've seen it. I've seen it 3-4 times, the most recent about a month ago, and I still can't stop thinking about it. Just be ready to settle in for a good theraputic cry."
5,Mesmerizing and beautiful,"The Virgin Suicides is the kind of story that makes you come to the realization of the just how beautiful life is. Everything is wonderfully crafted and puts you into the charater's mind. You begin to feel for these deprived and overprotected girls. You come to realize that with their restraints that it was inevidable for them to keep their sanity. This darkly exquisite movie is a timeless masterpiece set to entertain and purely touch your life with every emotion, esspecially for teens.I would recommend this film to anybody though the intensities of the plot may strike your heartstrings with a shock and your eyes with a couple of tears."
2,An Empty Mystery,"I started this film and dreaded its initial tone: I thought I was going to see another so-dry-and-pretentious-that-it's-not-funny ""comedy"" like RUSHMORE.But then the Josh Hartnett-Kirsten Dunst teen romance kicked in and I wasn't sure what I was watching. After all, it started with a 13-year-old's suicide (under vague circumstances) so I couldn't get a handle on this.It's competently made but it was never involving, never connects with its characters, never really works.It feels a little too smug about giving us an empty mystery."
2,boring and depressing,"this movie was obviously adapted from a novel; it has the timeline, pacing, and internal dialog problems that come with a poor adaptation. as some one who grew up in michigan during the 70s. i found the setting to be entirely inaccurate. from looking at all the italians, the exteriors, the interiors and etc. i would swear i was looking at long island, rather than lansing, ann arbor, flint, battle creek, detroit, or another MI city. i gues the midwest has some sort of exotic fantasy appeal to bicoastals. it reminded me of gummo in a way. i did appreciate the directors feminine interpretation of all the characters and the story. i also enjoyed the 13 year old girl details and nostagia."
1,Depressing and unrealistic.,"The Virgin Suicides starring Kristen Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Kathleen Turner and James Woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline. This film is directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), I really tried to like this movie but I was fooling myself, you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the Coppola legacy but just because your father is Frances Ford Coppola doesn't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time. Sometimes magic does not stirke twice. How can all five sisters end up killing themselves, their homelife wasn't that unbearable, a lot of parents are religious, but that doesn't mean you'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide. Kristen Dunst just gets on my nerves, her acting is the same in every film. Don't believe the hype, The Virgin Suicides is not a groundbreaking, poetic film."
2,Not Very Impressive Overall,"I was not very impressed with Virgin Suicides. Just knowing that the five sisters would all be dead by the end of the film probably assisted in my lack of enthusiasm in following the narrative. The mini-documentary in the middle of the film was entirely out of place and really just made things more confusing. The use of music to converse was certainly interesting, but was one of the few bright points of the film.The acting is good overall (not necessarily brilliant), and the choice of background music generally appropriate. Still, this is not a film I would enthusiastically recommend unless someone was a true fan of the actors and actresses in the film."
1,Conservative family kills daughters,"Or something to that effect. Another in the ""American Beauty"" camp of willfully narrow-minded views of middle America."
1,Awful,"This movie was horrible. It had a stupid plot, and was not even worth watching. In fact, I stopped it and never watched the end, because it was so worthless. Do not even bother w/ this because it's a time-waster."
1,The Road to Nowhere,"Think back through your lifetime, of all the books you've read, stories you've heard, and movies you've seen. Now out of the millions of these, how many of the proganists did you not like? A few, maybe. Now how many movies have you watched where you actually wanted the protaginsit to die. Very few, if even at all. Now how many where you sat through the whole movie just wishing and waiting they'd just hurry up and die already? How may where you wish you could just jump into the tv and kill the charactors. How about the actors, directors, and writers too for putting you through this mysery of wasting time, money, and precious brain cells?If you don't get my point, I reccomend you watch this movie. At least then you'll be either (a) abled to answer yes to every question or (b) know that you're too inane to know the difference between a movie and a hangman's noose, in which case you'd spend your time more wisely suffocating on the latter."
1,Am I missing something?,"This is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. Absolutely horrible. It's boring, far fetched,shallow, undeveloped, and just plain bad. I can't believe all the 5 star ratings! Is it because a Copolla was involved? What did I miss? I can't think of a movie I have seen recently that was this awful. Bad plot with characters you could care less about. I guess the music was OK, so 1 star."
4,solid directing by sofia coppola,"Sometimes you just have to give credit where it's due. Sofia Coppola singlehandedly destroyed Godfather III (and therefore messed up the trilogy that makes me think of the Godfather series as just having one, rather than two sequels). The universe had to be set right for the rest of eternity. So Francis' daughter has no margin for error for the rest of her life. She can't be making any more bombs.She succeeded with this nicely directed and written groove on five sisters who do the unthinkable. This movie is a great experience and worth viewing. James Woods is funny as the dad. Denny DeVito makes an interesting cameo. Kirsten Dunst is gorgeous. Josh Hartnett is excellent. Kathleen Turner is... Kathleen Turner. But Sofia Coppola has found her niche in the director's chair. Long may she create good stuff."
4,"""dont let it die a virgin""","""everyone dated the demise of our neighbourhood from the suicides of the lisbon girls. people saw their clairvoyance in the whiped out elms and the harsh sunlight. some thought that tortures tearing the lisbon girls pointed to a simple refusal to accept the world as it was handed down to them, so full of flaws. but the only thing we are certain of after all these years is the insuffienciency of information..."" in the last 24 hours i have watched the virgin suicides twice. good movie i must say. there's really weird type of melodramatic-abstract mental ideas/poetry/mystery. its a great film, not the happiest film-- but then again sometimes watching reality is sometimes more entertaining."
4,Very Depressing Tale,"The title of this movie holds no secrets. The Virgin suicides may have its up and downs throughout the movie but the whole time the viewer is left with an impending sense of doom. Almost every aspect of this movie is fantastic, between the acting and a great story line, but this movie is truly dramatic in that it will no doubt influence your emotions."
5,Wow! Really transports you back in time,"This film just sucks you in and for me I was totally returned to the late 70's early 80's. The music, clothing, neighborhoods, attitudes... just everything. And any film that can be satisfying while still leaving many questions unanswered has really done a phenomenal job. And this is definitely one of those rare films.We are granted privilege to know just enough about all of the characters without overanalyzing or emphasizing any of them or their particular traits. And I don't care who you are you'll be able to identify with one of the kids that's so well portrayed either in whole or in some significant part. The film just looks at the what and much less the why in respect to life during those oh so weird high-school years.It's hard to describe this one but it's just exceptionally good!"
4,A great film with much strength,"At first I thought that ""The Virgin Suicides"" would be an awful film because it was directed by Sofia Coppola, and we all remember her ""performance"" in ""The Godfather Part III."" While watching the film, I saw that she is a brilliant director. The way she shoots some scenes looks very photographic-like, and the way in which she injects portions of songs is very original. The story of Lisbon sister is indeed a sad one, and is very well acted by the always beautiful Kirstin Dunst, as well as the other four sisters. Kathleen Turner and James Woods give amazing performances as the parents of the sisters. A must add to the DVD collection."
2,rating,I find it hard to believe that they made this movie. I certainly would not recommend it to anyone for viewing
2,"Very Moving, Very Disturbing","The cast portrayed the characters flawlessly but the story line is dark and a bit.. well.. hard to follow. We get that the girls are unhappy but they are not abused, they have no restrictions in dress or appearance and they are all under 18 - meaning they have other options in the very near future. Dad is loving but spineless, Mom is religious and a tad overbearing but even with the removal from public school.. I don't see the cause for suicide. To me, this is a story that would influence young people to end their lives for reasons that are miniscule in the scheme of things. Nowhere in the plot did the children reach out to other adults or family members yet those same kids were willing to climb out windows, pull pranks and were fully socialized with their peers. Not the personality types to fail to seek a resolution. Not something I would want my children to see."
2,Didn't make sense,"It just didn't seem to make much sense. Ok, their mom was a little too much. But really, five good looking girls killing themselves because their mother was too strict? I don't think so."
2,kirsten dunst...,"... is a very attractive lass. and that's about all this movie offers. nearly zero character development. the plot sputters, never ignites. this isn't enough of an art film to pull that off (no taut plot), unlike the lovely lost in translation. it's supposed to be mysterious, etheral, the ending elliptical and spooky. it isn't. the first third has such promise. after the first suicide, it fails and dies, plausibity stretched until it breaks under the weight of disbelief no longer able to remain suspended. it becomes an Air/Heart music video, something pretty to look at, but devoid of pith, uncompelling. the book looks good. it probably just didn't translate to film well in sophia's hands."
3,Better Than The Book,"In this movie you see the lives of a family and friends go down the drain day by day. The Lisbon sisters/family seem to have it all until one of the sisters commits suicide. Their parents become tollerably strict until Lux (Dunst) ruins that for herself and her sisters. They are soon taken out of school, not able to communicate with the opposite sex, and soon take a wrong turn which turns fatal. Told in the words of the neighborhood boys who worshiped them and who come together 20 years later to try and solve the mystery of the Lisbon sisters. It is a solitary story of the girls' isolation and the sleepy portrayal of how they watched powerless as their fragile lives disappeared."
2,not what i expected,the flim sarted off good and then kind of was a let down.i really wasnt clear why the girls killed themsevles. after a while the plot just seemed to drag.the good things about the movie were the perfomances i esipically like joshharnett as the small but important role of trip fontaine. overall i felt the movie could be a lot better.
1,Stick with the Book!,"This movie has to rank as one of the worst book-adapted movies of all time!! The movie utterly lacked the insight, the depth and most of all the continuity of the wonderfully written book. There is absolutely zero development of characters, no poignancy present in the book, no urgency and no sympathy. Furthermore, the movie is, simply put, so tedious I almost fell asleep. Here is a telling point: I had NO clue what was going on in the movie and I read the book!! A friend with whom I watched it was supremely lost from the word, GO. She had no chance. Do yourself a favor. Read the book and stay away from the movie. Sophia Coppola's debut, I'm sad to say, matched her unrivaled performance in the Godfather 3 and anyone who saw that movie knows her performance all but ruined the entire movie. Sorry girl but leave the movie-making to your father."
4,Beautiful and Airy,"I had wanted to see this movie for a long time. Throughout the film, I felt as if I was floating in mid-air--hypnotized. The movie was sensual, listless, hypnotic and exquisite. I especially loved Kirsten Dunst as sexually provocative Lux Lisbon and suicidal, journal-writing Cecilia Lisbon, whom said in the beginning, ""Obviously doctor, you've never been a thirteen-year-old girl."" Overall, this is a beautifully made, elegant movie. I give huge props to Sofia Coppola in her directorial debut."
4,Sure Beats Her Acting,"I'm sure I'm not the only one who thought Sofia Coppola should be banned from Hollywood following her ""acting"" debut in Godfather III. ""The horror, the horror."" Well, it turns out that she is much better on the other end of the camera ... well, maybe. This is a very, very good film -- don't get me wrong. But don't for a second confuse it with an independent film. Daddy Coppola's big pockets are all over this film. The result is magnificent. Whether it's Sophia or Daddy who is truly responsible for the outcome is up for debate, but this is film well worth seeing."
2,ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz............,"What's all the hype about??? This movie is a good movie to watch if you suffer from insomnia or want to ruin your Saturday night. It was soooo boring and uninteresting. As I watched it I thought it would get better as it went on, but it never did... and there was never any climax to the movie.It was pointless to watch when the title gives away the ending anyway... we all know the girls are going to commit suicide... and we all never know why... their lives were pretty crappy... but weren't as bad as they make it out to seem.Want to know my opinion on how this could have been a better movie??? The girls should have slaughtered and butchered their parents...I'm giving it two stars because I actually watched the entire movie... almost shut it off though... would have been one star if I had resorted to that."
5,virginal beauty,"When I first saw the ad for this, I only wanted to see it because of Kirsten Dunst, I mean the girl is hot. Anywayz, when I saw it, I really loved its beauty and it really made the whole movie seems so pure and beautiful even though of its sad subject matter. It is interesting to see the parents downward spiral into depression and denial. Very humorful, very tragic, very beautiful. One thing I did not like was how the debutante party at the end, it did not tie in the movie together very wellOther than that, its perfect"
1,One out of 10 seems so grand when you really don't like it.,"I have something called a gut and it's real true and real honest to me, but I have a hard time listening to it. I read this book about a year before the film came out. I love it! It was and still is my favourite book. It's one of those books where imagination is key. I was dying to see the movie hoping it would have at least a strand of greatness that the book did but when I clicked ""Place in Basket"" I had a deep feeling that it wouldn't. It didn't. I know for many seeing the movie is just the easy way out, you don't have to read, but please, for the sake of your time and happiness, read it. The movie lacked everything tho book gained and in short -- I was not impressed."
2,Needs to be more developed... little information,"I think that the movie could have had a future with the story, but it was to wide. All that happens in it that is a little bit interesting is the suicides but even that the audience never knows how and why. It's not a great movie, I had higher expectations of it."
1,Does not translate well to big-screen,"Definitely do yourself a favor and read the book. As a movie, it's flat, sick, boring, and pointless."
2,the emperor has no clothes.,"when you read about this book or movie, it sounds a lot better than it is. sounds like an interesting idea, right, a household of sisters, in a repressive environment, all commit suicide? unfortunately the emperor has no clothes and everybody's afraid of looking like a dummy by saying so. the book, albeit weird, was well written but didn't translate to a movie. in an attempt to be deep and meaningful, it came out as merely pretentious."
2,"Everything is very good, except the story","This movie has the aesthetic sheen of all other high quality films. The performances were top notch--Kirsten Dunst's cocktease performance is every man's fantasy, and every woman's fantasy of how to torture a man. Josh Hartnett is a very good looking studly guy. And all the other actors were wonderful.The only problem I have is that just as you think the movie is gonna reach a great climax, we find out that the four sisters simply committed suicide. It's anticlimactic, and doesn't make for a very good movie.I think Sofia Coppola did a great job, but the book wasn't great for a movie (read: beginning, middle, end). Many people like this movie, but many won't.This is a love/hate movie. Rent it at your own risk."
1,Not one I would watch twice.,"Maybe I am not ""high brow"" enough to enjoy this movie. Lots has been written about the book and there was a fair amount of fan fare for the movie. I just did not get the point. I was an English major in college and I STILL didn't understand what was trying to be said here. So It did not work for me. It might for someone else."
2,Rather unimpressive,I do know what it was but this movie was rather dissapointing. I must say the performances are nothing but spectacular . I just seemed to have an empty feeling as i never was pulled into this so whatever sypathy i was suppose to have for any of the charecters was never developed. I also think there was a lot Lucky that we should have got to know but we didn't .The major flaw with this movie is there is no directive start of these charecters . This movie seemed to have a lot of art house cliches yet It was still dissapointing
1,Pretentious trash,"One of the most pretentious, artsy-fartsy films I've seen in the past ten years, this film was just awful. It doesn't work as a statement about anything, it doesn't work as entertainment, it doesn't even work as mood (e.g. a 90-minute music video).To put it plainly, it just didn't work for me. I say ""for me"" because given most of the other reviews here, I'm likely to be roundly lambasted for my opinion about this film. Please remember that it's just an opinion, and yours is equally as valid.Having said that, I can't tell you how much I disliked this film. Absolutely, utterly pretentious, nose-in-the-air egotistical sickening (and sick) nonsense. And I was a (suburban) teenager in the 1970's... trust me, it wasn't even a good portrayal of 70's teenage suburbia. Phoney, phoney, phoney! Stick to acting, Sofia!"
3,Not As Good As I Expected From James Woods,"Seeing him in his new series, Shark; and even in Against All Odds; brought more expectations of James Woods' role in this movie. I was very dissappointed in that his portrayal of a father of 5 young ladies was not deeper. In fact, his charactor was more of a figure head, while his wife, (good job by Kathleen Turner, by the way) ruled the roost. I was, however; very pleasantly surprised to see a fine performance by A.J.Cook, who I have throroughly enjoyed in Higher Ground, and Criminal Minds. Kristen Dundst, also was splendid in her role as the oldest daughter.In fact, all the young ladies who played the daughters were worth watching. Although, I would have liked to have seen deeper emotional acting in all of them. The movie was too sporadic in it's storyline. A little something here, and then nothing for a period, which left you with a ""hurry up already"" frame of mind. Definitely could have been written better."
1,"Decadent, artsy trash","This is one of the most truly decadent movies I have ever seen. It attempts to stir refined, delicate emotions based on the deaths (suicides!) of children. Caligula would have loved it.It has been compared to Picnic at Hanging Rock, but in that interesting, flawed film, the girls simply disappear without a trace. Whatever happened to them, the reasonable viewer is unlikely to conjecture that they committed mass suicide.If the movie suggested responses of shock, horror, pity, or indeed any of the responses that people genuinely have to such tragedies (say, the Jim Jones Guyana tragedy), I could be more generous. Instead, it seems to reach for a kind of dreamy, wistful nostalgia.It is reasonably well made for what it is. In fact, it took a couple of days for the truly repellant aspects of the movie to become apparent to me. I think that it is disgusting and decadent. Even if intended as a metaphor, the choice of subject matter is appalling."
2,Confusion.....,"If you have read the book you will find missing parts in the movie. In the book Mary doesnt die, she stays alive for 2 more months and then kills herself. It was a movie with no plot and made absolutely no sense at all."
5,suicide revealed,"When Virgin Suicides was first released in the theaters I'll admit I didn't rush out to watch it. In fact I never got around to watching it in the theaters. When it was finally released out on video I rented it and loved it immediately! It was tragic, touching, sensitive, and somewhat realistic. The subject of suicide hit home for me. Three days before my sixteenth birthday I tried but was unsuccessful in trying to commit suicide. It's a subject I don't discuss with anyone. I felt the desperation in the Lisbon sisters. When you're young you feel that you're misunderstood and the whole world is against you. Especially when it comes your parents not listening to you or dismissing you. Depression is like quick sand once it grabs a hold of you, slowly but surely it'll destroy you. Suicide and depression is a serious subject that should be addressed as early as grade school. It was sad that neither Lisbon sisters survived the tragic demise."
4,Poetic And Sad,"'The Virgin Suicides' is a beautiful film. Beautiful in its sadness, in its story, in its filming, in its acting. But especially in its sadness which is described kind of poetically.The film zigzags a little between genres which is not always a plus. For instance, the not unimportant idea of letting some 'outside' boys, who even seem very young, be the storytellers, is not really successful.What also remains fuzzy is the punchline. But these weaknesses in the storytelling style do fortunately not really ruin the poetic beauty of an all in all worthwile film."
4,SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL,"""The Virgin Suicides"" has proven to be a term that shall forever remain dear to me. This film, dealing with the tragic story of the 5 Lisbon sisters, is a beautiful and truthful conversion of the novel. It is visually brilliant, the scenes, sights and shots resonate in my mind, even as I write this review. James Woods and Kathleen Turner are excellent as the mysterious Lisbon parents. The directorial contribution of Sophia Coppola (a name that cause me to be apprehensive about this film) is astounding. She was able to see to it that the cinematic conversion of the novel retained all the beauty and mystery of the book. Also, worthy of mention is the musical contribution by Air, who put forth a perfect score, contributing as much to the film as any of the characters."
1,Better movies for your time.,Movie drones on and on. A bit fractured. Didn't have enough character development. There are many more movies more worth the time.
2,Slow movie,I honestly never felt the movie got anywhere. At times during the first half it was interesting but the movie never really made a point. Maybe its just me or its just one of those movies for those who like to break down a film and find reasons for it or reasoning w in the film your average Joe will not like this film
3,The virgin suicides,This was definitely an interesting movie. I couldn't figure out what was wrong with the family except that the mother was really strict and overbearing. These girls had suicidal tendencies. Sad movie.
2,Very Disappointed,"I tried author on basis of great reviews from other customers. After wasting time reading the first 5-6 chapters I jumped to the last 2-3 chapters and was glad I hadn't wasted more time reading entire book. I never felt anything for any of the characters, especially the policeman boyfriend who was about as animated and interesting as a lump of dirt. The killer was easy to figure out (and I didn't even read the whole book) and the reasoning for the killing left me thinking, huh? I guess we all have our likes & dislikes and I seem to be in the minority of opinion about this author, but I found Cuttings to be boring, boring, boring."
5,A jazz classic by a master who will be greatly missed,"Michel Pettruciani was undoubtedly one of the leading jazz musicians of his generation. On this solo album he demonstrated the phenomenal sense of rhythm that allowed him to develop two completely separate but intertwined lines, creating a rich and complex musical landscape while performing as a solo artist. His live performances, of which this is one, will be sorely missed. A fantastic CD, one which will not disappoint you."
5,A towering performance!,"Thanks to the lovely effort of a high appreciated person I could know this outstanding recording, sincer and deeply expressive in this Jazz sesion. Petrucciani was always a sincere musician, and his technique worked out as an ornament he simply did not need it to captive the most exigent audience.Go for this singular recording and you will enjoy it from start to finish."
4,Prisim Diet,"Book was in very good condition, and is very interesting. It arrived right on time. It is a stringent program, but it certainly does work."
4,prism,Very good book although I can never imagine me being able to stick with it. Its a nice idea have friends who are doing it and surviving
3,Thought it would be more,"I was so excited to see the Prism Diet available in book form that I bought it. I was disappointed however that it was justan overview of the program with referrals to your local support group or to call their phone number. Very little of the actual plan is in the book. They show phase 1 foods but that is the extent of it.The success stories are wonderful and very encouraging. Our little town doesn't have the Prism Plan any longer and I was so hoping that this book would give me the plan to get started.For those already in the plan, this looks like a great companion book to have."
1,A complete waste of money!!,"I've read other titles by Carlton Smith and have enjoyed most of them. However, ""Reckless"" is by far the worst book I've read in quite some time. In fact, I had to force myself to finish it.One is led to believe by the back cover of the book that the story is about the murder of Lana Clarkson. Don't be misled. It really isn't about Lana Clarkson at all. It's almost entirely about Phil Spector and his life as a record producer. Smith quotes heavily from two other books in this story. It's almost as if he wrote a repeat of what has already been written before by someone else. Save your time and money."
1,Boring,"This is the first book I've read by this author. Probably the last, too. I kept reading to get to the story about Lana Clarkson and Spector. Should have put it down after the first chapter."
4,"A nice, concise overview","It's hard to top Jim Klobuchar as a sports writer, and he does it again with ""Knights and Knaves..."" Covering the highlights and the personalities that have driven the Minnesota Vikings since their inception all the way to the dismal 2000 playoff game against the Rams, Klobuchar paints an inspiring potrait even amidst the many heartbreaking Vikings defeats. His frank and candid appraisals of such Purple legends as Tarkenton, Moss, Bud Grant, Dennis Green and Cris Carter will humanizie these gridiron deities, and supply the fan with information not found elsewhere. Aside from a few typos, and some inaccurate dates, I found ""Knights and Knaves"" very enjoyable and enlightening. A must read for any true Vikes fan like myself."
1,as poor as the Vikes' Uber Bore appearances,"Yet another Klobuchar book that gets praise from Vikes' fans but I wonder if Vikes' fans seriously know what good writing is. Klobuchar's writing style is such a train wreck, I cannot for the life of me understand how he got a job as a sportswriter other than the fact Minnesota must not produce, nor is able to attract, talented and skilled writers.I'm dying for a definitive book on the Vikings. Sadly, this is not it."
4,Glory Ends Sooner Rather then Later,A great read on the adventures of the Minnesota Vikings. I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in the Vikings both a passing fancy and a hardcore dedication. The writing is more then passable and pleasing to read as it moseys along with the trials and tribulations of the Minnesota Vikings. What can I say but one day it will come that vindication for being a Viking fan will come and disprove the legend that the Vikings will never win a Super Bowl.
4,Sax Rohmer is amazing,"I have read all Sax novels and they are all fantastic ! Rohmer is one of the best classic authors ever. His Fu Manchu series had me hooked through every book. I could not stop reading any of Rohmers exciting , superbly written tales of mystery and adventure. Batwing was no exception. Fun, exciting fiction that is different from others in style and subjects . You will never be bored reading a Sax Rohmer novel!"
3,Dated,"This was interesting as a door into the past. It takes place approximately 90 years ago in the English countryside. It was a bit too predictable and the pacing was slow at times. The most interesting part, for me, was the manners and mores of a time gone by. The synopses of the story is available elsewhere.Note: The ebook contains numerous formatting errors. If this type of thing bothers you, just remember it is free."
2,A bit disappointing...,"Although Muench images contained in this DVD are truly world class, I really think Halpern's music is not up to the same level of quality. Philip Glass would be a better choice by far..."
3,Operation What?!,"Actually this effort does have some redeeming factors. Fairly good acting, pretty good script, not too bad a story line, and moves along so as to keep you from falling asleep. Maybe not a stellar work, but good enough for an off night..."
3,Little too wordy,"I found some of the instruction a bit too technical. Unless you have studied Parelli before, not everything will make sense - a bit too technical for me yet."
3,About 50 pages of excellent Theory with 160 pages of filler,"Parelli has important concepts to share but I found the book very repetitive and lacking in some details. He has 3 chapters discussing his training tools but fails to describe how to make and adjust the hand tied halter he thinks is a ""must have"" piece of equipment for his style of training. I found my self hunting for the chapters where he gave actual training advice instead of advertizing hype for his methods, books, videos and clinics. He has a horrid fixation on making everything into numbered list and cutsy alliteration. If I read the phrase""the six yeilds(forward, backward, right, left, up and down)"" one more time I will gag. Overall I do think it is worth the Amazon price."
2,It kinda frustrates me,Don't get me wrong I like Pat Parelli and I can't wait to be at a level to use his techniques. But he's expensive. And not for the novice trainer that is on a limited budget. I think to get the most from him you have to buy his whole program or go to his ranch camp. I'm new at training and most of his stuff is too...i don't know....not specific. I think he is more of a fine tuning type guy until you are really experienced(or can afford his stuff) But I love his philosophy and ideas. So if your a novice I'd suggest waiting till ya get some time under your belt....try Clinton Anderson or John Lyons to start!
4,Great for Beginners to Intermediate Horsemen,I am in the beginning stages with horses. I found this book to be very helpful. It illustrates training techniques in pictures and describes each technique in text. The book gets you in-tune with your horse. I like the idea that is emphasized in relation to playing with your horse and working on yourself. Makes sense. I would recommend this book to other horse lovers.
4,It's a great book!!,"I bought this book at a local book store and I enjoy it. The only reason I would give it a 4 is because I think it needs more illustration to identify what it is trying to say. I'm the type that can look at a picture and understand more than I could by just reading. I have been refering to this book everytime I need help, I'm training my own horse. I want my new colt to be the best horse to his ability. This book explains alot that helps him mentally, not only phisically. I would recommend this book and trainer to any one that is in the process of training a horse or just keeping an old horse in line and something new to learn. If any one has a question about natural horse-man-ship with your horse refer to this book and it will help you understand what to do.Thank You, Leslie"
3,Save your money,I bought this book six months ago and I would not recommend it unless you have purchased the dvd's from the Parelli Natural Horsemanship. The book is very hard to understand/make sense of unless you have viewed the DVD's. Had I known this I would have applied the money I spent towards the DVD's. I have since borrowed the DVD's from a friend and feel that once I am through the course I will better understand the book.
3,Horsemanship,"While this isn't awful, Linda Tellington-Jones and John Lyons are far better horsemen. I recommend finding their books and reading them."
4,A Parelli Book,"This book is worth reading but it is not the be-all-and-end-all of training manuals (and neither is the Parelli concept). Personally, I found the book had a very commercial and promotional edge to it and could have been improved by Pat Parelli writing to enlighten rather than encourage his readers. Don't let this get you down though because the vast array of pictures and detailed descriptions of exercises and techniques is well worth the cost and time. I suggest though that this book is taken with a grain of salt before you rush out to buy all the Parelli merchandise you can lay your hands on."
5,HORSE MAGIC,"THIS BOOK TOOK ME FROM A PERSON WHO FELT LIKE I HAD MADE A BIG MISTAKE GETTING INTO HORSES TO ONE WHO COULDN'T BE MORE SATISFIED..I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE AND HAVING MORE FUN,,,,READ IT!!!!!! PLEASE DISREGARD ANY NEGATIVE COMMENTS UNTIL YOU HAVE TRIED THIS YOURSELF...A VIDEO MAKES IT EVEN EASIER TO UNDERSTAND...YOU DON'T GO TO THE FORD DEALER TO FIND OUT ABOUT A TOYOTA ....GO TO THE SOURCE...LEARN AND HAVE FUN"
3,Working together harmoniously,I like the ideas presented in this book although some of the principles are not expounded upon enough. The reader is thus left with questions when trying to put into practical use.
4,natural horse-man-ship:six keys to a natural horse human relationship,i enjoyed reading and value the information in this book.even if you don't have a horse just love them you would find this book interesting.
4,Parelli Natural Horse-Man-Ship,Pretty good book. Lots of useful tips on training problem horses. Some of the training is a bit too technical for the non-professional horse person. Makes me want to go to a Parelli clinic.
3,Popular but expensive and often unsafe,"Mr Parelli writes in a self-opinionated, pompous style about horses, trying to give the impression that he is the guru of all things equine. While his methods have undoubtedly enabled a large number of people to improve their relationship with their horse, one must remember that there are untold millions who have a wonderful relationship with their horse which owes nothing to either his expensively-marketed system or the costly, cutely-named gadgets which seem to be an integral part of this.With attention being paid everywhere to accident prevention, Mr Parelli would also do well to remember that many children will follow his methods. Novices need to remember things like helmets and sturdy shoes and Mr Parelli is in a position to set an example.All in all - not impressed."
5,An essential part of the overall series,"If you like the books of the Saga of Pliocene Exile, then Intervention, though very different, will also appeal to you. The story bridges the gap between the Saga of Pliocene Exile and the Galactic Milieu Series. It takes place in a more contemporary setting and reads a little like a mystery novel, but has all of the magic and mystery of the other two series. Uncle Rogi is a fantastic character who you will come to love. Highly recommended."
3,I wanted to relive the concert,"I went to 2 of Mana's concerts in Houston. Both times were just electric. While the video put me in the same atmosphere, I feel the song choice could have been a little better. Much of the album reminded me too much of the Mana en vivo album with much of the song selection coming from that album (el rey, vivir sin aire, rayando el sol, and donde jugaran los ninos (loved that one though)). I do wish they had a couple of Alex songs from the Amar es Combatir album as well as other big hits. Maybe even show the Alex solo from PR. If you didnt go to the concert and bought this DVD you're totally missing out on some of the best stuff. If they came out with a part 2 with some of the other songs, I know it would be better than part one. Even the Accesso Total had a better song selection. Im a hardcore Mana fan but this DVD and Live album kinda disappointed."
5,Mana is great!,The CD Arde el Cielo was packaged well and arrived as ordered. Mana is always great and merits listening and enjoyment.
5,Does anybody know what's in the DVD?,I'm just curious because I have all of the Mana video concerts and music videos on my iPod and I'd like to find out what's included in the Arde el Cielo DVD
5,A Bountifl Harvet,"While the product itself was excellent, the shipping was way out of line. It doubled the cost of the order.I own my own business, so I looked up what the cost would be for me to ship it to ""A Bountiful Harvest"". The charged me twice the shipping rate.We will not buy from them again."
1,Nothing like marshmallow cream,"I really rate this item at less than zero, but was forced to give it one star. It tasted awful and had a slimy texture. At least I only had to buy one container."
5,Tostada bakers,These are so nice that I bought a set for each of my daughters and one for our Florida home as well. Works great in toaster oven.
4,Good way to have Mexican food without oil,Perform as advertised. Good product. We use microwave oven.It is simple Amd in a few minutes we can eat a crisp tortillaAnd fill as desired
4,Makes eating a taco salad fun,"I like that I can make my own taco shells using the tortillas I prefer rather than the preformed shells for sale at the store. Plus these are baked not fried like what you get at the restaurant. It worked well and required almost no cleaning, they popped right out. Just be careful not to use metal utensils since this is not a super high quality stickless coating."
2,good series awful packaging,"THis series is quite good, and if you want to know about that, read one of the other reviews. This review is to warn you all about the packaging used on this set. It does not take long until the manufactured biodegradable packaging will not hold disks. all 3 disks from this set frequently fall out. this leads to disk damage and irritation. It's great that they are attempting to be environmentally friendly, but the execution leaves something to be desired."
5,Eureka!,I love this series! I wish season 2 was on DVD as well. Soo glad they renewed for a 3rd Season.
4,Sci-Fi for those that hate Sci-Fi....,"I usually dislike most Sci-Fi, but I really enjoy Eureka. I liked the show when I first watched it on Sci-Fi station, but I stopped watching because I hate commercials! When I saw the whole 1st season here on Amazon I promptly ordered it so I could watch Eureka without all the commercials! This show has a great cast with wonderful chemistry. I especially like that they add humor, with touches of spirituality, common sense and science. Colin Ferguson's character the sheriff 'Jack Carter' is my favorite, Colin delivers subtle humor very well. I am looking forward for season 2 to come out when it's done!!"
4,Smart and Funny,"Eureka is witty and entertaining. The first season on DVD could have included a few more ""extras"" in the package, but is still well worth the investment. Fans will enjoy it."
5,A true Eureka,"I like any show that can be quirky - especially when the networks seem insistent on calling something 'quirky' themselves - but I was resisting this show for some odd reason. Well, odd segued into downright foolish, because I haven't been able to get enough of this extremely different and nicely original television show. I'm not kicking myself for missing all those episodes though, because I'm too busy catching up! And I can't see why I thought I wouldn't like it, since I like other quirky shows likeDoctor Who - The Complete First Series."
5,Eureka,"Did not know what to expect going into the show but i was hooked from the beginning. I love the show and if you like science, mayhem, comedy, and fairly good acting you will too!"
1,The Worst Overrated Sci-fi Show Ever,"When i bought fringe Amazon Recommended Eureka to me , Amazon always Makes me Happy with Recommendation , This was my Frist Disappointment . the Show is Very Dull . Scripts That are Written for Teenagers . Nothing About it is like Fringe Expect the Massive Dynamics VS General Dynamics. if your a person who get easily offended or even get bored easily do not waste your time on this product , or even your money . This is Just a Stupid Comedy Show with a Sci-fi Effect ."
4,eco-friendly packaging,"The series DVD is great. But the eco-friendly packaging is pretty terrible. The DVD molded-disc-holder is made of crumbly blue foam material that breaks off easily and static-clings to the DVD playing surface, quickly degrading enough that it no longer even holds the discs in place."
3,Odd little show,"They took a unique idea and created an OK series. I can't really say anything bad about the show except that each episode is kind of ""same old, same old"". It's better than most of the shows on the ""thing that lives in the corner"". bg"
5,Small Town reality? with a twist!,"Another great entertaining series and I had to get this DVD of the series. My favorites selections usually disappear fast. I didn't get to see ""Dead Like Me"" before it was actually cancelled. Nevermind ""Farscape"" and ""Firefly""So all in all it contained all of the first season, so I'm happy,"
5,Eureka Season 1,"Excellent series, surprising and entertaining. The characters are great. Sci Fi Channels best show on TV."
5,WARNING WILL ROBINSON!!! DANGER!!! DANGER!!!,"Cannot say enough about what a GREAT and inventive series this is - HOWEVER, BE WARNED: IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO *WATCH* THIS GEM THEN BE AWARE THAT IT COMES PACKAGED IN AN AMAZINGLY CRAPPY HARD STYROFOAM CASE INSERT EVER DEVISED WHICH VERY WELL MAY *DROP YOUR BRAND NEW DVDS ALL OVER THE FLOOR THE MOMENT YOU OPEN THE PACKAGE!!!(*Reference: If your piece of buttered toast lands on the floor, WHICH side is going to land face DOWN 99 percent of the time?)Regardless, NEVER, EVER trust this case to properly lock your DVDs in place properly! Consumer complaints actually forced the company to switch its internal packaging to plastic hubs for the second season. You can buy replacement adhesive hubs at Wal*Mart to salvage your existing case.ENJOY!"
5,Eureka,Anything Eureka is fine with me. We have enjoyed the season and now we can re-watch it any time we want.
3,Amazon's packaging,"I'm perfectly happy with the basic product. The DVD set of Eureka Season One is what I expected.Unfortunately, the cardboard case holding the DVDs was a little beat up - the handling and packaging process was apparently less than ideal."
2,Not Enough!!!,"Not quirky enough, not funny enough, not dark enough...basically, not ""anything"" enough to sit through. TV is full of examples of that this series tried to copy.Unfortunately for those of us who said ""I'll give it a try,"" we remain scratching our heads about how this made it past a pitch meeting in the post-cocaine Hollywood era. I love shows that aren't traditionally popular. This ain't one of those."
3,13 episodes does not a season make...,"Whoever decided to call 13 episodes a season is nuts. I'll never pay $20 for any of these seasons, let alone $30. When they get to $14.99 (or less), let me know...The series Eureka deserves 5 stars but the decision to package 13 episodes as an entire season eliminates 2 of those stars. -kd5-"
1,Been Here Before,"Here's the latest lousy high concept, THE X FILES meets NORTHERN EXPOSURE. This is a low budget, cheap looking show that tries to be funny and misses by a mile. I don't get why the Sci Fi channel has so much trouble coming up with good orginal programming to match BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. How many X FILES meets (fill in the blank) concepts do they have to air on that channel? What of the biggest stumbling blocks about this show is that it is far too complicated for its own good. The acting is uneven and the more you watch it the more you lose interest. I got the box set as a gift and traded it at Amoeba for DISTURBIA."
5,Wonderful,"After looking around for DVD's to buy that were family oriented, fun to watch and intelligent enough to watch, I found the Eureka series. I watched the first episode and have been hooked ever since. I really enjoy the setting, the acting, and the story lines. The balance between the humor and drama is perfect. The content is family oriented and it is one of the few shows I can watch with my kids. The best thing about the DVD is I do not have to watch any weird SciFi commercials. Some of them are pretty grose.I would recommend this DVD to everyone."
5,Great show,"This is a great show. We don't care for reality shows, have enough of that in real life, so we really like to watch this one. Every week it's all fresh and new with all kinds of wondrous and funny things happening to the town of Eureka. It's a nice, clean, family show that is fun to watch. It arrived in great shape and we thought the price was really good for this dvd. When we ordered Amazon had the best price for season 1 and 2 so we purchased both."
2,"I love the show, but don't think it's worth the price!","I don't know about others, but I think this and a few other Sci-Fi shows are a rip-off. I'm not crazy about these mini seasons, I like the shows and would like to see more episodes. But, I especially hate the idea of paying full price for only a half of a season. Doesn't anyone realize that there are only 10 episodes in each season of Eureka and Doctor Who? The prices they want to charge for these ""seasons"" might be a little more acceptable if there were two or more seasons in one package. JMHO"
4,It's a great little show.,"Granted it can get a little cliched at times, but it's still an entertaining show. I like the variety of geniuses in Eureka, and I may enjoy Nathan Stark just a little too much. It's a great purchase of sci-fi fans."
3,Funny and entertaining,"This tv series is funny and entertaining. Can be a bit silly at times, but overall enjoyable to watch. Has lots of sci-fi in the background plot."
3,Geniuses Saved by Bufoon,"So in a town of apparently hundreds of geniuses, scientific geniuses, the townsperson who happens to, by his every act and word, have the LOWEST IQ, is the one who usually comes up with the answer to the bizarre, unknown and unbelievable.....but, wait, if he is smart enough to outsmart all the - according to the show - greatest minds on earth....."" how come he always volunteers to do the grunt work, with reckless abandon and no thought of what the town will do for a sherriff....hmmmm, something sure is weird about this most popular show"
1,Hoodwink!,"I am satisfied with what I order, BUT I am suppose to get free shipping and Handling if sold my Amazon to which is reads. So force without further a do. That it."
5,excellent,"Very nice to get a well made mirror that will adjust to any position and stay there. This mirror is well made and is constructed in a way to get just the angle you'll need and is sturdy all the ingredients of a first class co. and that is what I call great sevice. Also shipping is good and fast, bye."
2,Mirror,The mirror was a good choice for maybe a child's bike. The arm is too short and I couldn't see around my own body. I returned it for this reason.
5,Pyramid Deluxe Bicycle Mirror,"You can't beat the functionality and appealing appearance of this $5.15 mirror. I initially got it for my 80s vintage Sears Free Spirit bike. It installed easily, and there was even a black cap to place over the exposed part of the screw. On the handlebars of my bike, the ends of the metal bracket bent when I tightened the screw so that the mirror was securely fastened, but there was no harm done and you really couldn't tell the difference. The adjustable mirror mounts nice and low on the handlebar and won't lose its position even on bumpy roads. The glass in the mirror is distortion-free and provides a panoramic rearview. It's great being able to see the vehicles coming up behind me without having to look over my shoulder. I've installed the attractive black and chrome mirror on my new Trek hybrid, and it looks like it came with the bike."
3,Pictured item is not item received,"The picture shows a black mirror with a square-ish head. What I received was a long rectangular chrome mirror. True, a mirror is a mirror, but I wish I received what I ordered."
2,disappointing,"I fitted these to my handle bars and they kept coming loose. The metal part meant for anchoring it to the bike is weak. Bent while I was tighten the bolt so that it gets a good grip on the bars. Metal is to soft, and keeps expanding, hence the mirror keeps moving. I have decided to remove them and ride without mirrors. Sadly, I bought 2 pairs for my bike and my wife's bike."
4,Good mirror.,"This mirror blows away bar end mirrors, but may not be for you depending on your bars and brakes/shifters. It works fine for me on 5"" rise bars. The arm was too short for me to get a workable top mount position, but I was able to mount it hanging underneath. I would have preferred a top mount position, but I can see fine and this is still way better than bar end mirrors that are constantly getting bumped out of position. When my trekking bars arrive I think I'll have a top mount option on those.If I could change one thing on these I'd add a second axis of rotation where it mounts to the handlebar. That would open up a lot more mounting possibilities."
2,Wrong mirror for the job.,"Now I'm not saying this is a bad mirror. But it did not work for me on my bike. The arm was too short. It might work for you if you place it on the farthest end of the handlebar, near your pinky finger. But I was looking for something more near the center, near your thumb on your left hand."
3,Great mirror. Ungreat clamp.,"The metal used in the clamp that goes around the handlebar is far too pliable and bends out of shape. Requires constant tightening for the fist several months, after which it is unusable. The mirror surface is excellent thouhg, large area. But I switched to a smaller one that inserts in the bar end and have been much happier."
2,so so mirror,I have a hybrid bike with straight handlebars. It is very difficult to adjust the mirror to get a good rear view. If the arm had been a little longer I think it would be an improvement.
3,Did not fit my handlebars!,"I have a bike from the 1960s with original Schwinn parts and flimsy p clamp the mirror came with would only fit thin handlebars. I ended up asking my local hardware store to drill a larger hose clamp. Works great on cruiser style/ north road handlebars. It takes a little adjusting the angle and tilt of the mirror so you can see the cars next to you. Not really adjustable on the fly besides angling the mirror up and down, but I think that is the case with most bike mirrors."
3,Hard to read,Even though the book was hard to read it contains some material(s) good for conducting an in depth binle study
4,"Promising first look, great service","I haven't read the book in its entirety, but when I received it, I opened it at random and was hooked - twenty pages later, I reminded myself that I had other things to do and forced myself to put it down (hence the four stars.) I now understand why this book is well-reviewed, and look forward to using it for the rest of my daughter's history class this year. I was also pleased with the quick, trouble-free delivery."
3,Good Customer Service,The warehouse was damaged and this item was one not recoverable. The seller did contact me right away and explain. Check was returned within 10 days.
4,One disc girl gets the job done!,Like most double albums (the only exceptions being 'The White Album' and 'Exile on Main Street') this one could have been reduced to a single disc. Does this mean it's a terrible album? NO! It contains some of the Boss' best songs! It's just that there's just a little bit of filler that needs to be cut out.Bottom line- imperfect:yes good buy: yes!!!
3,Irregular,"This first CD in thsi set is much better than the second one. THis is already sufficient to downgrade this album, which has some outstanding pieces like the title track."
4,down to the river,Great album. When is this (and the rest of Springsteen's catalog for that matter) going to be remastered and be available with a decent sound?
2,LOOOONG and peurile.,"I bought this two-record set soon after it came out; it was my first Springsteen purchase. It is full of essentially worthless, boring, tedious, cliche'-driven songs. (""Cadillac Ranch"" and ""I'm A Rocker,"" for example, are simply inane.)"
5,pure rock n roll,"Ramrod. Cadillac Ranch. Two Hearts. Out in the Street. Sherry Darling. You Can Look. The Ties That Bind. Songs like these should always be heard with the volume turned all the way up and the furniture pushed up against the wall so you can run, yell, jump up and down and go nuts. Or out on the highway where you can pay more attention to what's blasting out of the speakers than to how fast you're going. And if you ever get lucky enough to see Springsteen and the E Street Band perform these songs in concert, the way you listen to this album will never be the same. Oh and did I mention that there are slow songs on here, too? 100% well rounded, unmatched rock n roll. Enjoy."
1,his worst,"i really like springsteen, but am not a ""bruce can do no wrong"" type of fan, and after listening to a borrowed copy of ""the River"" recently i gotta say this is his worst album. i'm glad i listened before wasting my money. if you're a new fan start with something great like Tunnel of Love which won't disappoint."
1,Over-rated album by an over-rated artist,"This irritating, tinny, repetitive schlock soared on the hot air pumped out by Bruce's moonie-like fans. This record served first warning that BS would devote much of his time to chasing the ghost of Woodie Guthrie - hence, the ponderous, grim tone of ""The River.""The only noteworthy thing about this record is the worst sample of grammar in music history - from ""Hungry Heart"":""Don't make no differnce what nobody says. Ain't nobody likes to be alone.""Ain't no 20th century artist, with the possible exception of Ernest Hemingway, more over-rated than Bruce."
2,Most overrated Springsteen Album,"In the 70's Bruce released 3 masterpieces, all completely different from one another. The Wild The Innocent, Born To Run, Darkness On The Edge Of Town. 3 practically flawless, mature paintings - everything you could want in an album. I was convinced Bruce could do no wrong. And then this thing came out. There are quite a few good songs on The River, maybe even a couple great ones. But what makes this album a real clunker is the sheer number of half-baked, mind-numbing, happy-crappy pop songs. The man who gave us Incident On 57th St, Thunder Road and Darkness on The Edge of Town now presents us with Crush On You, I Wanna Marry You, I'm A Rocker, Ramrod, and a few others which I thankfully can't remember now. This stuff is bad for you. bad. bad. Listen to Blood On The Tracks twice and call me in the morning."
3,Absorbing Compendium!,"Between the period of initial colonial settlement and the American Revolution, a period of over 70 years, England and France fought four wars for control of the North American continent. This book focuses on these successive wars.Edward Hamilton has reconstructed this amazing story of wilderness, forts and weapons. He takes the reader through each successive war with a surgeon's precision, utilizing some of the best maps ever constructed to detail the magnitude of the European engagement being fought on North American soil. Vital, thrilling and fascinating, the French and Indian Wars culminated an age old rivalry and set the stage for years to come. In the long view, this excellent account shows us exactly why we speak English today instead of French."
1,Not what I Thought It Was,I believed that I was getting a text book not access to internet information which is impossible to find. I need to return the item soon. I just reread the item description on your web site and see that it really is described as a text. First big disappointment from Amazon. Either the wrong product was sent or it is badly mislabeled.
5,King Kid,"King kid was a wonderful book. I have no idea why they would put a book like that out of print. It's humerous, and is wierd, and zany, which I like. Overall, this book deserves a 10!"
1,Worst sound card Ive ever owned,Creative is one company I will never again support. They released a defective sound card with problems with static and crackling and never did anything to resolve the issue but instead tried to blame it on everyones motherboards or other issues and refused to take responsibility. They even went as far as to try and charge users for driver updates and silenced other users who tried to offer fixes.Do not purchase anything from Creative. They care nothing for their consumers and sell awful products.
5,Fantastic Sound Card!,"Amazon was great about getting the sound card to me pretty soon after I ordered it. It didn't take very much work to get it up and running at all. I'm running windows XP, so that might have something to do with the ease of installation and use. I'm absolutely loving the sound that I'm getting out of my PC now!"
5,A Force to Live By,"In addition to being a great writer and really good singer, Jeff's such a beautiful guy with this big heart and this extraordinary mind and he's smart and talented big time. He has the potential to do so much with his music. He can take it to extraordinary lengths. He could offer a lot to this world. He's not only talented musically, he's also outspoken and he can get out there with his beliefs. I'm serious this is a brilliant guy. He reminds me of a young John Lennon. He's on his level. Listen to his stuff and buy it. I know it's going to inspire you. You will love it. Everything about your self will come out. He is extremely talented. This is a man that will inspire people in a lot of ways and be a good force on this planet."
4,"Opener ""Raunchy Rita"" is the highlight","This jazz record features the quartet of co-leaders drummer Elvin Jones and bassist Richard Davis, plus saxophonist Frank Foster and pianist Billy Green. Foster's energetic, funky eleven-minute opener ""Raunchy Rita"" is outstanding. The remainder of the album is pleasant but not as immediate or enjoyable as the opener. It includes an abstract, eleven-minute version of the Gershwin standard ""Summertime"" and Jones experimenting with lead guitar on the simple ""Elvin's Guitar Blues""."
1,Too weak to be useful,Don't try spraying anything with a viscosity greater than water. It just can't muster the force to get it out.
3,Some Flaws,"Hudson 62518 NeverPump Porta-Pak Fanny Pack Battery Operated SprayerThis is a good unit. It works, The design, however, is flawed. The tube does not nattach to the tank as firmly as it should; therefore the tube is likely to fall out of the tank. This has happened several times since I started to use the unit about a month ago."
1,Sprayer,"Lacks power, PSI, to wash the side of my house, shed or garage. Could not even wipe the dirt from my car."
1,Simply Garbage,"I realize that this unit is inexpensive, and at this price you can't expect perfection, but god. This thing is a total waste of money. You would be better off using the money to buy lottery tickets. I don't understand how Amazon can sell such garbage. First of all, as most of the other reviewers stated, it cannot spray anything other than water, and it barely sprays water. You can spit further than this thing can spray. The stream is VERY weak. The only nice thing I can say about it is that the tank appears well made.. The tank will last a lot longer than the sprayer.If you have money to waste, buy this junk.. If you don't have money to waste, spend a little more and buy a quality sprayer.."
3,"Good, but not great.","I don't eat a lot of processed food so the natural ingredients of this soup appeal to me. However, i think it lacks any real flavor other than salt. The thyme isn't very prominent. After eating a few bites, I jazzed it up with spinach and sliced zucchini, because it really needed something more. It is a better choice than those with preservatives and additives, but don't expect magic."
4,Interesting,"Hustling backwards held my attention mainly because I was more interested in getting to the sequal, Snitch. I didn't know about hustlin backwards until I read the inside cover of Snitch. I enjoyed both books and recommend them."
4,Every Day I'm Hustlin'!!!,"Capone, Vonzell and June are three friends outta North Carolina in need of a big come up. Since opportunity never comes knocking in the hood these three have to hustle hard to get in the game. And once they get their foot in the door it's a wrap! With all the money, cars and women they knew it would also bring about jealousy, envy and deception. But what they weren't expecting was the federal investigation.This book could of easily gotten all five stars but I had to take one star away for the cover. But author Mike Sanders definitely redeemed himself inside the book penning a tale that proves, ""No matter how far ahead of the game you think you are -you are still Hustlin' Backwards""!"
4,Good Book,"This is a good book! Page turner from start to finish! It was good enough for me to buy the second part ""Snitch"" can't wait to finish it!"
1,Transformer,The toy looked like so much fun on the internet until my child opened it up and actually started to manuver it it is so difficult even for an adult to change it from a car to the person we have tried for several days nobody could do it it's such a frustraing toy it has never been used since those few days and we all do not recommend it at all. p.s. It is very durable it didn't break but it is very much a strain it is impossible to play with sorry!
1,Two of these delivered dead...,"Beautiful watch. It's a pity that the first one I received (as a Christmas present for my wife) was dead on arrival. Amazon worked hard to correct the issue even going to great lengths to overnight a replacement to me in another town where we were spending the holidays (still didn't arrive before Christmas but...). However, the replacement watch was also dead. So there were two of these $1000+ watches delivered DOA. Not good..."
4,It did not run !,"Yes it is a very nice watch.However, when I gave it to my wife as a Christmas present, IT DID NOT RUN.Very disappointing.This new watch needed a new battery !"
3,"Re ""I Understand""",another reviewer asked about I Understand...... this is fact was Freddie And The Dreamers who sang it.Just saw Herman's Hermits on PBS last night and they were still great
3,Soul in torment...,"It would be easy to write Smythe off as an oversexed coward with the morals of jackal but the old rascal does come alive on the pages and the author, a proper English gent by the sound of him, does take it out of him something rotten. As in the author's other works - Oriental Henry and Happy Henry - the peculiar British sense of humour takes some getting used to but as long as you don't take it too seriously, the old stiff upper lip does quiver on occasion."
4,Good overall review - helpful in preparing for exam,"I found this book to be very helpful in preparing for the certification exam. But there were a tremendous amount of typographical errors and a couple of incorrect anwers. Fourth printing needs to be proofread better. Despite this, I would recommend this book."
3,"Nice Pictures, Story is very safe.","I enjoyed the wonderful pictures that practically fill this thin book. They truly are unique and rare photographs for the most part. However, the story as far as a biography goes is sorely lacking in any great depth. And as you might expect of one's son, told from a safe vantage point, leaving much of the true gritty details out. The text encompasses as much a play by play of Don's racing career more so than anything else. Those who want to know the true story of Don Aronow beyond his race victory's should look elsewhere, but do by this book for the pictures, they are excellent."
5,toy,Five year old granddaughter loves these things. She had one but wanted another to expand her building.
2,Not enough information!,"This product does not give you enough detail information to let you know that the blocks aren't more that 4 inches and the entire puzzle is approximately a 12x12 block. It's not what I was hoping for so I wasn't happy with it.If the size is what you are looking for, it is good quality."
3,Puzzle Mat,"Received on time. Good mat for my daughter, is a small one but she creates forms, she does not look at the numbers on the mat."
4,a great rock record,"this record is dense with melody, full of twists and turns, and full of some really rocking songs! a very very solid follow up to the wonderful Olympian debut! kind of like Morrissey with bigger balls."
1,Hmmm.,"Listening to this album is like getting a phone call from a clingy drama queen that you've been trying to break up with for the past two weeks. Don't get me wrong-- I love fey, wispy British bands. I credit the Smiths for my surviving puberty, for heaven's sake. ""Drawn to the Deep End"", however, is just plain cloying. ""Crash into my arms and just hold me""?! I don't care how, just get it off me."
1,Lame,"What stupid lyrics. ""I can't take it"" (must of been listening to this music),""We could be Kings"" (heroes was already taken?), ""I'm lost in the fog"" (agreed), ""I now know why I was born"" (now thats really lame), and so on it goes. One forgettable line after another. The worst of the worst ""I'm incapable of breathing"". If that were true the listener would be spared from this nonsense because the singer would be dead. Come to think of it that is what best describes these songs."
2,Not the best book available!,"I'm sorry but this book just didn't do it for me! It is too large and heavy, not to mention expensive. The photgraphs aren't as clear as other books (namely Botanica's Roses)and it doesn't included many of the most popular roses.Yes, it does describe each rose, if fragrant, how often it blooms and any known diseases, but then so do other books!My advice is to buy Botanica's Roses. It is paperback, much smaller and lightweight (ideal for taking to the nursery).So save the [price] and get the better book!"
3,If only one would have convinced her NOT to sing...,"This album would be a lot better if terry lyne carrington had stuck to playing drums, rather than sing as well.She sounds like...well, let's not go there.I think she shouldn't have.Other wise this dinc could be a real winner."
3,The EmPHAsis is on the Wrong SyLLABle,"Hendrix was a revolutionary musician whose influence remains incalculable, even nearly 40 years after his death. His lyrics, however, are not why he's remembered.Which makes it doubly odd that Le, who is himself an enormously-talented and inventive guitar player, should choose to record a tribute to Jimi that all but ignores everything Jimi was known for. Each track is sung (the female vocals being the primary focus) while Le's modern jazz band bootscoots around in the background. Not only does Le strenuously avoid any Hendrixian guitar tones, but the rest of the band avoids any tempos or moods that might remind of Jimi. There are a few African elements here and there (percussion and Zulu singing) but the vast majority is a muscular uptempo jazz reminiscent of John Scofield or David Torn.In short, the only tenuous link that remains to the music of Jimi Hendrix is the lyrics -- which to my narrow way of thinking puts the emphasis on entirely the wrong syllable."
1,Missing Hardware in Order,"I orders the 18"" docking wheel and I was surprised to find after I had installed it to the dock that the hardware was missing. I called the vendor and I am still awaiting for any type of call back. Don't think I will be buying from this vendor again.Capt. Ken Pappas"
2,Good but Dissappointing,"This CD has a lot of Bobbie Gentry's hit's on it, but many of them are too old and I guess I was expecting more of her recent sound. I guess that is partially my fault. Bobbie Gentry's sound today is different to me than it was 30 years ago. I like it a lot more now. I would like to hear these hits redone with her current voice and updated effects. I think it would add to the effect."
4,"An excellent, inciteful glimpse into a search for self.","This is one of those rare books that gets better with every turned page. It is a well written prose; intelligent and emotional, so keenly mirroring life as a professional lesbian mother. I cannot wait for another book from Ruthann Robson. If you like good writing, this is great reading."
3,Frankie Laine's Greatest Hits,"You feel Frankie Laine songs, not just hear them. They're rehearsed, but his drive seems pure impulse. He ranges from pounding restraint til he belts out unleashed fire. Like movies, though, the first versions seem best and this CD has some updated songs. I cut teeth on The Mercury Years and found a few later quick arrangements and even some fine orchestrations left me leary of ""Greatest Hits"" of lesser quality. I'm always looking for downloads that go back to ""That's Liberty"" & the non-Sinatra ""In the Wee Wee Hours of the Morning"" (same title, different song) of 1944, but no luck - fans, keep me advised. If you've not heard the original studio cuts, you'll like any of these tracks, but the old ones aren't just great, they're classic."
4,Not just for Dads,"Using the sports theme, the author presents dozens of games to play with your baby to build their physical and mental development, as well as to promote bonding. My husband and I found that we just ""naturally"" did some of the games suggested before we even had the book, but it offers a wide variety of things to choose from and gives and interesting background on what benefits the activity offers.This is a great book for a new dad OR mom and offers games from birth until about 2 years old."
1,The dumbing down of parenting,"I absolutely hate the condescending tone which the writer takes in her assumption that all Dads are mainstream sports fans or jocks. There seems to be a little bit of good stuff here, but I'm finding it hard to wade through the dumbed down writing style. Most of the ""games"" are no brainers that any attentive dad will come across anyway."
5,Provides great combination of nutriets for health,"I have used this product for several years. I recently ran out and stayed off for a month. My PMS returned and I noticed bad irritability and a shorter luteal phase along with more fatigue. I also noticed slight headaches throughout menstration. My daughter also had increased acne. (She is 16 and also noticed improved health while taking 4/day for the last year. While high stress is a factor in my life, it is hard to know what is causing what symptoms, but the luteal phase had been very consistent until I stopped the vitamins and the irritability was significant. I trust this product and believe it has high quality nutrients and in the right doses."
2,gave me a headache,"I think the ingredients in procycle are good, but they are too potent for me. Gave me a headache almost instantly after taking one pill. If you have high metabolism or tend to be sensitive, these may be too potent for you. If not, maybe they will work for you."
5,Attention Playwirghts,"As a playwright I found this book to be illuminating, easy to read and full of ideas. Heartening to read all the directors that give prominence to the palywrights. sometime s you feel they are the forgotten component. Qorth reading for anyone in theatre, whether its elementary schoo, high schoo, university, community or profesisonal"
4,intresting book,"This book contains a lot of tips for people involved in cg animation, but mostly is the story of bluesky studios, their works and their hardware."
3,Not what I expected...,"Hmmm... Kind of like it, kind of don't. Don't know why I was expecting a lighter read than this - but I was. It's not however a light read. It deals with a minion of the devil himself. Definitely not a nice character. Can't deny that the story is a definite new twist; However, unfortunately, the author has spent way too much time describing Mike & Abigail's feelings for each other & thoughts about each other. Kind of aggravating & gets a little boring."
4,Big all right,"Is this a power conditioner or power station, big isn't the word and heavy. It is 20 1/4"" long, 5 1/4"" wide and 2 1/2"" thick. The shipping weight was listed at 11 lbs. and that wasn't packing material. Does it work, i hope never have to find out if you get what i mean."
3,Very dated movie,"I'm a huge George Maharis fan so I'll watch him in any movie. But this is a very dated movie and most viewers today would find it rather boring. I did like Eileen Brennan's performance however. She was believable in her role as a spinster. Overall, the movie would probably not be worth watching for today's audiences."
4,Good little every day carry knife,"I bought the all-stainless version of this small (2.5"" blade) folder because I liked the heft and feel of it in my hand; and, because I wanted to test out the quality of these Chinese Spyderco's. After 2 weeks of constant carry there are no disappointments except that the brushed finish on the handle is already scuffing. But, hey, where else can you get a Spyderco (Byrd) for $20? It's a keeper. Perfect for jeans watch pocket EDC."
5,a must read,not only the outfit but all other parker novels written by the peerless richard stark (donald westlake) are utterly thrilling and highly entertaining. but don't start to read a novel when you don't have enough time to finish it at once! real page turner!
4,Tough Book Noir,"Those who enjoy Stark's(Westlake's)storytelling will not be disappointed, though this is hard-boiled stuff even for Stark. This time Parker is out to teach the mob a lesson, and he has just enough friends to do it. After a face change and some rooting around he gets the job done, but not without some blood and unpleasantness."
5,Great bang for you buck,"You never think you will need this much water, but you do. This is a great size water bag. Unfortunately, It doesn't quite fit at the top of my bag. That's ok though, I can slip it down the side, I'm just afraid of squizing it too hard when I pack my bag."
2,A BIG disappointment...,"I agree completely that [most of] the writing is magnificent and compelling (why else would I have stayed up reading until 4am?). However, the ending was SO cliched and SO unsatisfying that it seems destined to be a made-for-TV movie. But if you're looking for a Chick Book, read on."
4,Heart's Desire,"Mark Spragg's Fruit of Stone is a book that wakes your senses and your heart. You can hear the meadowlarks, smell the scents of creek bed, leather, ranch and barn, taste the dust and steak and beer in his words; and you can feel your heart soften toward the unlikable Bennett and break at the solitary-ness of McEban's character. You understand McEban's generosity and his reticence through the people he came from. Grievous behavior, big country, wind, snow, storm, guns, broken bones, forgiveness, human longing and tenderness fill this book to the brim. I hope for more from the author - soon."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book to be well written. The plot, however, left much to be desired. It centers around a man and his friend's search for the man's wife in response to goofy, ridiculously self-absorbed letters left by the wife (for some unexplained reason) at various post offices throughout the west. What occurs during the search is even less realistic. Moreover, we are told very little about the wife who we are to accept as some sort of modern day Helen of Troy. All in all I found the substance of the story silly. This was disappointing because Spragg's writing at times is excellent. For beautiful writing about the American West in a highly realistic context, try James Galvin's far superior The Meadow."
1,Michael Corey is a fat loser.,"You'd think that with all his education and ""expertise"" he would have been a professor at a prestigious university, perhaps Harvard or Princeton. But no, never...at least not according to his CV. In fact he's done more work on why men cheat on this wifes/girlfriends than on religion. I love how one reviewer (probably Corey's mommy) wrote, ""I marvel when I thumb throgh [sic] the bibliographies in the back of your books. You are the scientific equivalent of Bach."" ""the scientific equivalent of Bach?"" are you kidding me? Wow, he has extensive bibliographies, that's amazing, if only his arguments and reasoning were as extensive and impressive. If Michael Corey were the ""scientific equivalent of Bach"" he'd be well respected in the scientific community, which I can find no evidence of. And, by the way, Christian freak scientists don't count, because they will defend Corey because he defends their silly faith. In summation, Michael Corey is a fat loser."
5,"Memorable, superbly crafted writing.","The entire history of the twentieth century can be traced through the clandestine affair of the junkman Orlo and his Greek lover Leini in Orlo and Leini, the Rafael Alvarez collection of short stories featuring these two memorable characters, their lives, times, friends and associates. The stories comprising this memorable, superbly crafted, highly recommended collection include: Down at the End of Clinton Street; Orlo's Velvet Room; People Love Lies; Red Cabbage and Apples; Christmas Eve; and The Legend of the Velvet Room."
4,NAET: A time that has come!,"Thanks to Dr. Devi and her labors to get this treatment into the public arena. A should read book for anyone with allergies who have had enough of standard medicine that only treats symptoms over, and over, and over."
1,This book didn't deliver what it claimed for.,"I read the book and found it not much useful. It didn't help me to ""Say Good-Bye to Allergies"". This name was very attractive but the book is full of garbage."
1,One star is too much.,"I thrown this 'book' into garbage. Many words but this is allergy, not psychology. No book heals allergy at least this book has not helped mine. Better stick to traditional medications."
1,Disappointed - This does not work,"I got the book and then tried NAET method of allergy removal for my son, spent thousands of dollars over one year with absolute zero results.People like such are out there to victimize parents of autistic kids."
2,nav,"This book just explains what NAET is and that a NAET practitioner can use his expertise to get rid of your allergies. If you are buying this book for self help, to learn what you can do to end your allergies - its not a good pick."
2,Not as thrilled as I'd Hoped,"The idea behind this book is exceptionally appealing, but I was a bit disappointed in what I actually got. It is basically an advertisement for the NAET method of allergy removal. That method might very well do everything claimed, but I was hoping to get some insight into what I might do for MYSELF. That was missing. Instead, an introduction into the struggles of the author, some of the theory behind energy therapy, and a basic introduction into muscle testing. Past that, the reader is encouraged to find the nearest practitioner for actual allergic relief."
1,Summer bummer,"Besides having TWO tracks by John Travolta on it, SONGS OF SUMMER consists primarily of inferior remakes of those great old tunes we used to listen to at the beach, barbeque or poolside. Definitely not recommended!"
2,Not Enough Boom,"I have to admit when I first bought this disc I did so because it was hard to find original Boomtown Rats' discs. Geldof's solo career only took off because everyone was keen on the guy who gave us ""Do They Know It's Christmas"" and his humanitarian work.Now that you can at least find ""Tonic For the Troops"" and other Boomtown Rats' discs, this compilation is not really worth the investment."
4,Best Show On TV...,Best Show On TV And Great DVD / BLU-RAY Set.Would have been 5 stars (material) but the case sucks !Discs come loose - must be slid in over other discs - be very careful super easy to scratch and even CRACK Discs.Change it for Season 2 please !
4,"Good value, works as advertized",The seat is well made and works the way it should. As good as any out there at a better price.
3,not bad; glad I own it,"This remix is not all housified or techno'ed up like later PSB singles. However, if you enjoy basic extended versions of songs from the 1980s, then this is for you. This single comes from the ""Actually"" disc, which I would argue was the Boys' most successful album in the United States. Though this single wasn't released in America, when you listen to it, it'll make you think about ""Rent"", ""I Want to Wake Up"" and other memorable cuts. I would recommend you purchase this if you are a harccore Pethead, which I am."
4,Good book for the money,"This book covers more than just the lumber. It explains how trees grow, how forests are managed, how lumber is cut, and some basic woodworking techniques. Endangered trees are discussed and marked throughout the book. Traditional woodworking woods, plywood, and man-made woods are covered with characteristics, common uses, workability, and finishing tips for each. There are many beautiful pictures and drawings throughout.A few things could be improved. The wood descriptions are arranged by scientific name so a better index is needed to help locate common names. For example ""Walnut"" and ""Black Walnut"" are not in the index, but ""American Walnut"" is. A section of the book shows pictures of each tree species (20 per page) but instead of having the name by each picture there is a ""from left to right"" list in a small box at the bottom of each page."
5,Being in Love,"To be able to find that special someone in the sea of crowds & fall in love it's a beautiful thing. What makes it even better is that these love stories last through the years. Dispite being in a sometimes discriminating society when it comes to gender issues, I applaud all the couples who have made it this far and to more years to come.Through all the individual stories I read, I smile, I cried. Most importantly, I began to believe in love again."
5,We're Back,"I once owned this album on tape many years ago. I used to love it, then got sick of it and threw it away. Now I love it again. I have the first Ghostbusters soundtrack as well and like both films."
3,Ghostbusters II soundtrack,"When I got the cd, it wasn't very clean. There were a couple fingerprints on it and there was a crack in the cd case."
3,Ok.. But doesn't beat the first,"The ghostbusters 2 soundtrack is better than the movie. But still, who pays 35 dollars for a CD when I got mine for 7 dollars at a yardsale?The soundtrack isn't too bad, but it isn't even a shadow to the soundtrack AND the first movie. That one had story, depth, great character representations, but most importantly: Humour. The ghostbusters 2 movie is more meant for kids, since the humour is more kiddie humour. So, uhm, uuuh, I never buy a soundtrack if I don't think the movie is good, so you have to be a real fan of the SECOND movie to enjoy this CD."
1,Where's the beef?,"There's nothing here, its academician speak! If I had wanted a dissertation I'd have bought this from UMI. I thought I was buying a book, not an abstract. Steer clear of this one!"
1,Poor Read!,"I would like to agree with the comments from the reader from Brown University. Simonelli left much to be desired from this book. He often used repititous techniques to fill up pages. Further, he would introduce new information, but fail to mention how or why these conclusions were deducded."
1,Only hope for Amrica!,Rockwell may have been the only hope to how our world became today.America no longer the same country it was say 30 years ago.mass non-white immigration from third world nations flooding America has taken away the spiritual beauty of this once proud land.Rockwell was our only hope.if he live today.the Nazi Partymay have gotton a good start.Rockwell was indeed the Greatest man who walked this nation!
1,Horrible...,"don't even bother!It keeps freezing up, turning off, and won't sync with any of my mp3s. Samsung was very unhelpful and said that it was ""a Windows/Microsoft problem"" when I reported when the device was starting to sync, then caused Windows Media Player to shut down (on 2 seperate systems!) entirely and then the USB cord is faulty, saying that it is unplugged when it is not.Instructions were incomplete and shoddy.Try a Zen player or a Rio. Those at least work right out of the box, plug in the USB, and you're off."
1,Defective Mp3,"I receive my Mp3 player on tuesday jan. 7th, wasted hours downloading all my songs. The next day my Mp3 did not even worked. I called Samsung and they informed me the Mp3 player is defective. So now I have to pay for shipping and send it to samsung and wait an additional week and waste more time downloading the same music. The Remanufactured price is great, but all the wasted time????? When I contacted sumsung, they informed YH-820MC 5 GB digital audio player has been stopped, due the problems on the hard drive and they are no longer making anymore."
2,Its not compatibale with most usbs and hard to download music into it,IT is not that good as i expect from samsung products.
1,Not reliable,"I purchased this player and two days later it froze. I contacted Amazon for another as a replacment, again this one froze. I bought this for a gift an wasnt happy at all. Amazon did refund my money in a timley fashion. I just won't buy a remanufatured Samsung audio player due to the poor quality."
3,Its alright for the price,This thing is out of date and i cant even get it to be recognized by my computer. Then the tech support from Samsung cant enen help me. Once i got it to transfer songs it was alright but now i cant do it again so i really wish i hadnt bought it so thats how i feel about it.
5,LOVE IT,I DIDINT THINK I WOULD LOVE IT SO MUCH AT FIRST BUT ONCE I GOT IT AND ADDED MY MUSIC I FELL IN LOVE!!! IT HOLDS SO MANY SONGS GREAT IF TRAVELING LONG DISTANCES!!! GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE!!
2,Copy of SAP's help.,"This book is nothing more than a copy (literally) of SAP's help with a few add-ons. If you have access to SAP online help, you would be wasting your money on this book."
2,Not a single illustration in 350 pages!,"This is a competently written book, full of information about SAP HR. However, it attempts to lay out concepts of system organization and the interrelationships among modules and various kinds of data without a single illustration -- chart, diagram, schematic, whatever -- to help the reader visualize and understand. Appalling for a book of this kind."
2,Too General!!,"If you're looking to simply look up some general info about the various modules, it's fine. If you're looking for ""how-to"" info related to various config possibilites, forget about it!! This book doesn't reach anywhere near that!!!! But.... that's exactly what we want isn't it?? Even discounted, it's not worth the $$, but if you are a complete novice to SAP HR and only want generalities it's terrific!! It's your money!!!"
5,A Sort-Of Review,"I bought this as a birthday gift for a close Romanian friend, who fell in love with it immediately. She said she could ""hear"" the Romanian text behind the translation, and loved its stories. She would have read it straight through, but her father took it from her for himself as soon as he saw it. I haven't read it, but its enthusiastic reception from these two Romanian Christians living in America recommends it strongly, in my mind. I know it includes the lives of John Cassian and Paissy Velichkovsky (responsible for the spread of the Philokalia and the Jesus Prayer into Russia--see ""The Pilgrim's Tale"" and J. D. Salinger's ""Franny and Zoe""), but I know nothing else about it."
3,Not as good as others in the series.,"We have most of the ""If You Give A..."" books in the series. This is not my favorite, or my daughters. When we pick books to read in the evening, she usually passes right over this one and goes for the ""Pig"", ""Moose"" or ""Cat"" books. It was alright, but not the best in my opinion."
4,Cute Book,"This is a cute book, and just as good as the first few in the series. My daughter loves reading this one."
3,Don't like this as much as some of the others in the series,"It really seems as though the author is stretching a bit. The story doesn't totally hang together to me, and it seems more cutesy than cute, if that makes sense. Like she's trying too hard.My nieces enjoy it well enough, but I would suggest the original instead."
3,Loosing steam?,"My son loves the previous books in the series, and this one is not bad, either. The drawing of the mouse peeking out from behind the book in class is fabulous, as is the blackboard sequence where he shows off his spelling and math abilities.But this title lacks some of the sparkle and mischevious charm that made the moose and the pig and the original mouse such lovable characters. It comes across as a bit uninspired, there's no crazy, yet logical, sequence to follow, just a series of interesting spreads of our mouse showing off his amazing skills. Skateboarding... whee. Basketball... whee. So what?The giggle that builds to a crescendo as you near the end of the other books is missing here, leaving you... wanting. So, it's back to muffins and pancakes and cookies for us."
4,"cute characters, fun and lively illustrations","This must be the 5th or 6th in this series that pairs author Laura Numeroff and illustrator Felicia Bond in a creative partnership that has spawned more than a few adorable characters and situations. While the bold watercolors are as enchanting as usual, the story is weak here, focusing on action and mischief rather than the charming overarching story arc that surfaces in their better efforts. This book is fine, but others in the series are better. Buy 'If You Take a Mouse to the Movies' and get Mouse .. School at the library."
4,Another Wonderful Addition to A Funny Concept,"Another in the cumulative series that begins with ""If you Give a Mouse a Cookie."" The sound recording that comes with this one is particularly good, and although the novelty of the concept is beginning to wear off this is still a quite enjoyable book. Children from two to five love the humor of these books, and the silly fantasy can provoke some very funny play."
3,ok,"this book is cute by itself; but, by comparison to ""if you take a mouse to the movies"", its less cute."
4,This Mouse is great!!,I thought this book was great! I thought it was so cute how the mouse was at school with the little boy. Overall I think this book was really good!
3,Nice,"Short selections, but on ""repeat"" any of them make for peaceful sleep. Well, other than the Mountain Range...The goat/sheep noises just make us laugh."
2,Mixed feelings,We were enjoying the CD and when we were just about to drop off to sleep; and idoit rooster (on the CD) started crowing!! That did it.
5,Magnificent,"The martini tastes really extra special out of these glasses. How does one go about getting the rest of the set, wine, ect."
1,They could have tried to remaster this,"Everything Billie Holiday did is worth owning, but the sound on this CD is the worst I've ever heard, and I listen to a lot of jazz from the 20's, and this material is from the 50's. Still Billie buffs will want it all."
2,too apt to print articles that are not so,"Grit has been around for a while..It wasn't always a ""slick"" magazine. But be careful of the so-called experts. I ruined part of my garden and set the remainder back for some weeks by using a "" Miracle bug killer"". I Have two years of college and have been know to complete a thought in it's written form so I was able to follow the ""formula""..WHAMMO!!! Dead and dying garden...It has some good things in it but it aint the Bible so be careful....Doc Meeks"
4,The Last Town on Earth,"An interesting scenario plays out when a small and remote logging town quarantines itself to escape a mysterious illness that has spread through the nation. The illness is reminiscent of the plague and the fear that grips the town leads to interesting interactions. However when the illness comes anyway despite their precautions, there are new and interesting challenges they must face. This is a book worth reading."
5,Wonderful,"Excellent read!! I couldn't put it down. In addition to the very entertaining story, I discovered things about those times that I had not known. I was shocked to discover the ways the government used their authority to change the First Amendment Rights to control the opinions of the war. The 1918 flu epidemic was really brought home and what a situation like that can do to the human race gave one alot to ponder - not only the death but what fear can do. I am using this book as my presentation for our book club!!"
4,Interesting backdrop,I bought the book to learn more about a period in history while also enjoying a book of fiction. I really did not learn much about WW1 throughout the book until the author's note at the very end. I was really surprised to learn that the influenza epidemic killed as many as 100 people worldwide in one year.I always believe the sign of a good book is one that stays with you for awhile. I think the backdrop of the influenza epidemic has piqued my interest. I think the decision to create a storyline around this tragedy attributes to the success of the book. My next book is about the Great American Dust Bowl....seems like I am glutton for learning about terrible times in US History.
2,Overall a disappointment,"I really wanted to like this book. The whole idea sounded so intriguing, but in the end the book really fell flat to me. Not only was it hard to get attached to any of the characters, but the plot ending really fizzled and left me disappointed. The pacing of the book also seemed very slow in parts, and I really had to almost force myself to finish it at the end. Sadly disappointed."
3,The Last Town on Earth,"Its an interesting book from a historical point. It not only covers the flu epidemic, but digs into the 1st world war with its detractors and supporters and the unions vs the sawmills.Some of the army scenes are quit compelling, but I couldn't help but feel that the dialogue was very modern and did not reflect the way people might have spoken in 1918. Anyone with knowledge of the Pacific Northwest will find an added treat in the narrative.A very quick read, great for an airplane."
2,Disappointing,"This is a story about Commonwealth, a little mill community at the end of a road in the forests of Washington state. It is 1918, WWI is drawing to a close, and the Spanish Flu epidemic is in full swing in America, but has not yet come to Commonwealth. So the residents decide to quarantine themselves. No one comes in and no one leaves. But two different soldiers show up at two different times, under suspicious circumstances and things start to fall apart.I found this book very disappointing after hearing about all the praise it received. While the premise of the book sounded good in summary, Mr. Mullen has a very difficult time getting to the point, inserting LOTS of pointless description on every page. I don't care about how someone runs their finger around the rim of their cup or how tendrils of hair flutter in the breeze. It doesn't contribute to the story at all. Without all that description, this story could have been told in half the number of pages and been a much better read."
4,Great Character development,"One of the best things about this book is the way it leaves the reader asking the question, ""What would YOU do?"" The idea of ""cutting off"" a community to save it from what's going on outside that community was a very real option for folks living in that part of the country during that time. The pros and cons are so interesting to think about. I love Mullen's character development. His subjects are complex and his writing really gives you a chance to get inside their heads. This is a very worthwhile read."
2,Good plot wasted,"After reading some reviews here I decided to read the book myself. I made it to page 186 before giving up on it. The plot idea is great, but Mullen does not do it credit. There are two major faults: 1)whenever any tension starts to build, it is broken by long passages of boring detail; 2) this leads to the second problem: too much ""filler"" that does not contribute to the storyline. Mullen could greatly benefit by studying a writer like Hemingway who knew how to say something in a concise manner. Mullen repeats character background stories to the point of boredom. He began with a very workable idea but let his writing get in the way. Better luck on his next attempt."
5,One of the Best,History lessons with good parallels to today set in the context of a good novel. I couldn't put it down.
1,I could kick myself,"for buying this book. Why didn't I read the other 1 star reviews first? I got as far as 30 pages and resigned myself to the fact this book will not get better. I had apparently read the first chapter online here and found it very good. I assumed this was how the book would continue...but no, it took an abrupt detour into a shallow story with not much mention of the flu. Words spent on character development but moreso, the writing was elementary and uninteresting. Descriptions were nondescript and boring. I could have written this book. It was like Message in a Pill Bottle."
2,Where's the empathy?,"This book had everything that it needed to become a really great novel. It had an excellent plot, an original storyline, etc. But I never felt emotionally invested with the characters. So disappointing because I felt like this book could have been so much more."
2,"Sputter, sputter","The story setup was great ... quarantined town, neighboring towns in trouble, fort nearby, Philip's moral dilemma. All the pieces were set, and then ... the author just didn't know what to do with the great setup he'd created. The last 50 pages were an extreme letdown. I can just imagine someone like Stephen King taking the story's setup and running with it ..."
3,Tedious,"A long drawn out tedious book. Based on the 1918 Flu Epidemic that swept across America. This book takes place in the mythical town of Commonwealth, Washington. When the flu begins to hit neighboring towns hard, the owners of a remote mill town decide to cut themselves off and live in a self imposed quarantine. All seems to go well until the flu comes to town. Was it carried by the two soliders or were there other reasons? Alot of guilt and a lot of finger pointing. The last quarter of the book was better then the beginning. You just have to muddle through to get there."
4,Great historical fiction,"A well structured novel that unravels in details and plot with characters making complex decisions. There's much WW I, Spanish Flu and Labor history shared in this provocative story about a Washington town.For those listening, there's an excellent, detached narrator that keeps you interested. I thought this was a great audiobook, as the descriptions and dialogue are rather straightforward and easy to follow. There's plenty of suspense, though it's not genre fiction."
4,easy novel to read,"an interesting story, easy to read, and some historical meanings behind it...recommend it to the college students who want to know more about history around WWI."
4,The Last Town on Earth,"Take a minor event in American history, add the flu epidemic 0f 1918, WWI, a new mll town in the northwest and you have the makings of a great story. Thomas Mullan has done just that in ""The Last Town on Earth"". With the flu epidemic wiping out towns across America, the newly formed mill town of Commonwealth has decided to quarantine the town to keep people out so that their residents do not catch the flu. Then a soldier appears at the blockade and is killed. What happens next as Commonwealth struggles with being locked inside its own borders? Mullan has written a fascinating and touching story."
4,Interesting Story of Pandemic response,This is a well written book that looks at a difficult situation from a variety of perspectives.
2,The Last Town on Earth,"This is the worst book I've read in years. The story line is so promising, but the author lets us down with an incomplete ending. The only reason I read past the first half was to hopefully find some last chapter redemption, but alas. I love historical novels, and this book is supposedly based on some historic facts, but the history was not dealt with in either an informative or entertaining way. Only two of the cast of characters were given more than cursory examination. The book was just a lot of words dealing with a lot of sadness. I couldn't get a closeness with any of the characters, so I really didn't care what happened to them."
2,Not the greatest book I've ever read-But I did read it,Good to read if there isn't anything better in the house. Story seemed disjointed in places.
2,Disparaging the human race.,What a sad and demeaning concept of our fellow man. We had a long drive so we heard it all but it was the down side of an otherwise delightful visit to the great northwest. I couldn't wait to give it away and be done with it!
1,"Waste of time, sad, no ending",This is a sad book that leaves the reader wondering about the many loose ends that the author leaves hanging.I could just read the newspaper for sad news without endings.
5,"Compelling, a fantastic first novel!","I loved this book. The historical period the author writes about is fascinating and the book drew me in till I truly felt a part of the tension of the times. The characters were real and believable; the plot interesting, and the writing first rate. I was disappointed when it was over even though it was 3 in the monrning! I look forward to more from this very promising author."
2,Great topic deserves better,I'm in line with the other 1 and 2 star reviews. I went with 2 stars because the topic is so good and I was able to finish it (what a relief).If you're going to start out your novel on a plague with a quote from Camus - you better deliver. This novel did not.The characters are shallow stereotypes. The plot is painfully predictable while at the same time being juvenile and unrealistic. In the authors opinion people who would take reasonable steps to protect themselves and their families from a deadly plague are foolish and wrong. Count me as one person who would keep the kids home from school while a deadly plague like that of 1918 is rampaging through the community!The authors ignorant view of humanity is well matched by his writing ability.
2,Boring detail. Weak characters.,This book for me did not live up to expectations. I found it boring and too many times strayed off the center story line to go into long boring sub plots that I simply cared nothing about. I wanted to care about these people but I didn't simply because they were weakly developed with too much time spent on boring detail. When the prisoner who is thought to be a spy tells Phillip his story the author tries to put you there while it's happening to him. The detail in dialog is just to the extreme and halfway through I did not care about this guy or his history and in the end it simply did not matter. So why spend pages upon pages to tell his story? The history of the flu epidemic was interesting and I liked the authors 'idea' of how one town handled the situation but other than that I didn't care about the people or what happened to them.
2,A painful struggle....,"....to get through this book. I thought the concept was intriguing, and, liking history, also thought the historical component of the storyline would be interesting. They're not. The writing is painfully sophomoric. I'm certain a 12 year old could pick this book up and it would be an easy read for them. Mullen does not write convincing dialogue - it comes across as flat and unemotional, leading to weak character development - compounded with his inability to successfully change character points-of-view, adds up to failed literature."
2,"Good idea, weak execution","I was bored by this book. The idea is a compelling one, but the writing is leaden and drab, in need of a much more talented editor to tighten it and make it come to life a bit more. The anachronisms and editing lapses were annoying too. Did teenagers in 1916 really refer to their mothers as ""my mom""? I don't think so. I bought this book because there were so many positive reviews here which usually bodes well, but if you like books that are actually compelling to read, skip this one."
4,If you can take the depression...,"This is a very well written, well researched effort. However, it is very dark - just when you are sure things won't get worse for the characters, they do. I listened to it in the car and had to turn it off several times just to get away from the downward spiral of the story arc. Having read several similar books, including The Plague, and having heard stories from my mother and grandmother about this period, I was still unprepared for the unrelenting nature of the story. I do look forward to the author's next effort, but with some trepidation."
1,Juvenile writing falls flat,"Thomas Mullen had a good thing going until he proceeded past the first couple of chapters of this book. The characters and situations are straight out of a high school girl's sappy diary/fantasy. Idealistic mill workers who garden together and don't fart and cuss? Give me a break. The romantic adventures of 15 year old kids made out to be upstanding citizens facing dilemas of great consequence just don't work. The teenage love plotlines embarrass me enough that I might puke if I have to recall them in any detail. Better to have stuck to the flu, the life of a milltown, and the political dissent. Clearly these topics were researched in a cursory manner for this book and the author does not draw on any sort of deep understanding of them. The author might have a successful career in trashy ramance novels, but not in serious literature."
3,ideologues driven by emotion,The main characters in this book are ideologues whose actions are driven primarily by emotion. Perhaps this is a good representation of reality -- witness the recent debt ceiling drama. But it's disappointing that even in our literature we cannot imagine people who entertain a more complex reality and think through their actions.
3,An OK read,"This is an OK read, but not a riveting page turner. Probably of more interest to those who have not read much about the flu pandemic of 1918. The characters are not as fully developed as I like."
4,Gripping,Gripping edge of your seat story about what people will do when they're afraid or pushed to the edge. Definite keeper!
2,wonderful topic but badly written,"I'm surprised at the glowing reviews of this book. The prologue was great, but I had to put it down after 5 or 6 chapters because the prose just plain stunk. The characters are very badly drawn, and the writing is very stilted.The suffragist wife, the damaged orphan, the spunky grocer's daughter--ugh.It was like watching a bad episode of Little House on the Prairie."
1,Good Set Up - Poor Execution,"I am never sure how a book this poorly written gets published. It is filled with phrases like ""grappled with a world that had turned against them."" or ""armada of men going to the mill"", just to name a couple of endless number of heavy handed phrases that make you wish an editor had read read this book. I found it painful."
2,No Advanced Techniques here!,"I bought this book because I wanted to find something that would take my work beyond the standard fair of PowerPoint presentations. I stumbled upon this book title just before its release and thought by the title that this was exactly what I was looking for. Advanced techniques would give me a book detailing the cutting-edge of PowerPoint. Boy was I wrong. A whole chapter on text placement? Other chapters detail creating an org chart, creating templates, and using the text tool. Does that sound like advanced techniques to you? Sorely disappointed in the book. My quest goes on for a cutting-edge PowerPoint book."
2,Thought there would be more.,"I was looking for an easy more in depth arena for power point, specifically how to cut small portions of a video and put them into the power point.However it did have very clear information."
3,Advanced only in title,"First of all, the comparison to Tufte's book, or a recommendation as a complement in another review for this book is a joke. To those who don't know what I am saying, Tufte tells everyone to stop using PowerPoint altogether, and this book would probably give him a headache."
5,Balsam for my ears,"I had never heard of Joel Harrison, so I bought this CD because Norah Jones sings on two tracks.But it is the instrumental version of ""This Land Is Your Land"" that makes this CD for me. What a version this is!And all tracks on this CD are great.I don't like jazz music, so this can't be jazz(??)But who cares, as long as this CD make me happy."
3,Big and dopey looking.,"It looks nice in the picture, but it's actually probably too large for casual wearing."
2,Disappointed!,"I purchased this for my wife as a Christmas gift and was disappointed when it arrived. First of all, this watch is huge, especially for a woman who has a smaller figure. The diamonds are small and really don't sparkle all that much.I guess it really depends on your taste, but be forwarned before purchasing. I'm going to return and find something else."
5,Review,"Nice watch, very good quality, excellent price.It's a perfect gift for a lady.Excellent Amazon's service, terms and conditions."
1,"Purchase less than six month, no longer working","Purchased in 4/22/2011, it is totally stop working, anyone know about warrantee,how can I get help. Paid nearly 200 dollars,late over 2 minutes daily, now it is no longer works."
5,Bulova women's 96R50 diamond watch,"I obtained all what I purchased. Great appearance, great quality, good price. All those that have seen the watch were admired about it's elegance."
5,Very satisfying comforter,We are very happy with this down comforter. It is not too warm but just right. We got the king size and it fits our queen size bed perfectly. We don't need the electric blanket anymore.
1,Words Can Be Decieving,"I got the comforter and was completely disappointed. It was extremely thin and ""fluffless"". When I held the quilt up to a light, revealing its feathery insides, I was only able to find a few squares adequately filled with down and feathers. The outside fabric feels cheap and is rougher than anything else on my bed. (My sheets are 250 stitch 100% cotten)It feels exactly like a 50% cotten 200 stitch sheet I have. Definitely not a good buy, but maybe worth 20 bucks. You get what you pay for."
4,goose feather king size,this is the best deal for the money. it keeps you comfortable all year round.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I bought this book a few weeks ago because it had some combinations of ingredients that appealed to me.I baked two loaves of bread the following afternoon, both ofwhich turned out poorly. I figured - bad bread day. It happens. Yesterday I tried two more recipes. When I finished, I threw out both lumps of bread quickly followed by the bookitself. The previous reviewer got it right. Didn't anyonetest these recipes! It could give BHG a bad name."
5,Gr8 product !!,"Luv this bra! It's is made w/ me in mind, I hate bras. Use it all the time! Blah blah"
4,Grandson loved it.,"Grandson always has enjoyed building things out of Tinkertoys, Lincoln Logs, and Legos. An Erector set was the next logical step. He loves it."
4,A timely piece of work,"Samuel Cozzens visited New Mexico and Arizona barely in time to see new US Territories acquired in the Mexican War as they'd never be again. The Apache was more-or-less at peace with the white men. The Texas Confederates hadn't yet campaigned up the Rio Grande, causing Arizona to become a major conduit for men and materials. Gold hadn't yet been discovered in either of the two territories.Cozzens visited Tuscon, Tubac, Sacaton, Mesilla, Acoma, Laguna and Zuni at a time when they were still new from the US perspective. His descriptions of the people, the places and the times are well worth reading again and again. A grizzly bear attacks their mule in the Zuni Mountains. It must have been one of the last opportunities a mule had in New Mexico for such an experience. The book is loaded with that sort of thing."
4,Great strap,"Very nice, very classy guitar strap. The only problem is that it's a bit too expensive. Other than that, it might annoy some people that if you like your strap a bit shorter as I do, you'll end up fastening it to the guitar with a bit of material to spare, so a strip of fabric hangs off the end."
2,More cardio than kickboxing,"This DVD gives you a nice workout, but really isn't kickboxing. I was hoping for something more extreme. It does have a nice pace to it."
4,great workout dvd,"just started working out again, and i LOVE this workout!!! It has a different workouts that you can do all together or separately. If you are even thinking about buying this do it."
5,KICK START YOUR METABOLISM,This DVD is so enjoyable & motivating. Fantastic music and of course nothing but the best instructor-chris Freytag :) LOVE HER STYLE A+
5,Great workout,"Excellent cardio workout with simple moves so you don't have to worry about memorizing choreography. I just wish each section was longer rather than just 15 minutes, but overall I love it."
4,"Liked weights section, cardio not as much","I do like Chris Freytag as an instructor, she is always encouraging. I consider myself an intermediate/advanced & I didn't find the cardio sections of this very challenging. It was too repetitive for my tastes. That being said, I really enjoyed the "" Body Sculpt"" section - used only 5 lb weights but I felt it. I enjoyed the weights/kickbox combos. I will work this one into my rotation on light days."
1,Narcissism on parade,"What a waste of paper! It would be hard to imagine a more self-indulgent exercise than using literary critical skills to analyze your own gushy fantasies about a celebrity--at times it veers from mere triviality into being deeply offensive in its presumptions about how one can ""dissect"" someone's private pain. What's been most appalling has been to see how the example of this work has given license to other young scholars to write their own equally flimsy and self-congratulatory works on their own private dream worlds (such as Kevin Koppelson in his recent book on Nijinsky)."
1,Too bad a tree had to die for this!!!,This mush from a professor at Yale? EEEgaddds!!! I have read more insightful writings from my fourth grade granddaughter. I sludged through to page 17 and decided that one barf per chapter is more punishment that I can bear.
4,Solid part with low price,The part is cheap and works well. It was easy to install and works pretty solid. I only have two suggestions:1. Make sure they look like the other one on your bike if you are not gonna replace both sides.2. Make sure this lever works with other parts on your handle. In my case I have to put it in a different angle because of the shape of my transmission roller.
5,A favorite accessory to the house!!!,"This is one of my kids' favorite additions to the Dora Dollhouse. The diving board is suprisingly durable, and says cute phrases and sounds when ""jumped"" on. I like that Dora can be sitting in the pool with her duck-foaty, while Mami, Papi or even Daisy can sit on the deck chair and watch so Dora can be safe with a grown-up :) To stay upright in the pool, Dora has to be positioned just right sitting in the ""shallow end"", but that hasn't been a big deal with my kids. When the Dollhouse is on the plush carpet, this piece is difficult to keep attatched, but on our wooden play-table, it attatches with no trouble. Overall a cute addition that has been a hit in our house."
4,GREAT CD!!,love this cd because of the latin beats and the BOOMONG bass that come out of my speakers. great cd for the hip hop/rap/latin beat type song lover.
4,Southern Belles are back!,"I just love to look at this gorgeous doll. I only have a few dolls, and this is one of them. She is fresh, and her hair is long and soft."
3,Pretty doll.,"This doll is quite pretty, but her dress is sewn on. If you, or the little one, takes it off, it can be refitted for a Silkstone -- because it takes that much fabric to add the snaps. If you want to put it back on a standard Barbie -- get the needle and thread out."
2,Not Helpful For This Mother,"This book was full of the author's guilty feelings, which is fine if you're just looking to relate to someone. In my case, I got this book as a gift and thought it looked interesting. I was hoping for more scripture to help me get over (or better control) my guilt about being a working mom among other things. Instead I learned all of the author's mishaps in parenting. It was OK, but just not something I'd recommend to anyone."
3,OKay,"A friend recommended this book. It is just not my style. I dont feel bad for telling my kids no. Neither should you. It is for people who are very guiltridden. Not healthy guilt-less moms. I thought that if you read the book and feel that way, it is not funny. Maybe great for some I didnt finish it. Borrow from a friend."
1,couple of major flaws,"I never thought I would find myself reviewing a toilet seat, they've always seemed pretty generic to me. But this one has been a real headache! First of all, the plastic bolts that came with it were too short for my toilet! Of course, I didn't get around to returning it, and then it was too late. So I managed to find the correct bolts here on Amazon, which added several dollars to my cost. But worse than that, now that I've finally got it installed, the little flaps at the back that cover the bolts will not stay closed! The only way to keep them from popping open is to loosen the bolts a little, but I certainly don't want the seat shifting around. What a pain in the behind - pun fully intended."
1,Nice Seat with Cheap Hardware,"I would not recommend this seat. Yes it is nice and comfy, but not 3 weeks after I installed it, one of the PLASTIC hinges snapped. Why make a nice seat like this and then supply CHEAP PLASTIC hinges - I didn't expect this sort of poor quality from Kohler. Now I have to buy a new seat all over again."
1,Cheap Particle Board Breaks Easily,"I should have read the product description more closely: ""Hardwood fibers molded with phenolic resins"" is marketing gibberish for particle board. When this seat arrived, the screws holding one of the hinges had already come loose and there was particle board dust all around. I screwed them back in and installed the seat. However, you usually cannot repeatedly screw into the same hole with particle board since the material breaks down. Sure enough, the screws came out of the hinge again within a day of installing the seat. I'm throwing this cheap product and replacing it with something better."
4,Nice to sit on,"What can you say about a low cost toilet seat? Certainly less costly than in a big box store, but hard to get too excited about this product. It delivers for the cost and allows you to deliver when you need to!!"
4,Good Seat,Bought as a replacement part. Easy install. Good price and expected high Kohler quality. Recommended. Feels better than sitting on cold porcelain!
4,Just Right!,This chair is just the right height for our 18-month-old to sit and watch his TV shows or to pull up to the coffee table to play or color. Light enough so that he can move it on his own if he wants. Removable cover goes right into the washer/dryer.
4,fun for its size,i grew up on pinball. this is a fun little machine (found it on sale for 249) have played a lot on it and have not beaten it yet. if you want pinball fun for 1/20th the price this is for you. it will take practice but thats half the fun.
4,Very Good for Its Size and Price,"My husband and I collect arcade-type pinball machines. On a lark, we bought a heavily used, non-working P of C display model. I called Zizzle and requested that they send replacements for the broken parts and was thrilled when they arrived three days later with all the instructions I needed to fix the machine. This machine is well supported by the manufacturer (I'd give five stars for their customer service), and plays surprisingly well for a smaller scale machine."
3,DECENT FOR WHAT IT IS,"I agree with the other reviewer that it is not a substitute for a 5 grand pinball machine, but it is pretty fun. The layout strikes me as a bit sparce in terms of bumpers and action; I would definitely recommend seeing and playing it in a store before purchasing. While it is well constructed, I don't think it's worth $399 - more like the $200 we paid at C*stco. (but good luck finding it there)"
2,Not too good,I have played pinball a lot and this one doesn't even come close to the arcade. You cannot keep the ball in play very long before it goes through the very wide gutter. My 10 year old played 3 games and just gave up. Save up your money and get something else. This is definitely not worth it. If you buy this one you won't be playing it for long.
2,"It is beautiful, however always slow","I have bought it less then one year. At first, it is good. However, 3-4 months later, movement always slow. Now, I have sent it back. I hope the problem can be resolved."
5,Unique watch,Bought for my wife as Xmas gift. She loves the beautiful design of the band and quality finish. Strongly recommended.
5,Seiko SUJ337,"This is a ladies watch. It was delivered on time. It looks exactly like it was pictured. We are happy with it. I bought this model because it is supposedly water-proof to 100 feet and I thought that indicated a higher level of workmanhip than those models not having that feature. We haven't tested it in water and don't intend to, howver."
4,Fifty From The Trail,The book was in great shape. It was easy to go through all the steps to order and I got my books fast.
5,Enhanced for students of Buddhism,"In Hermit Of Go Cliffs: Timeless Instructions From A Tibetan Mystic, Cyrus Stearns draws upon his impressive Tibetan scholarship to translate from the writings of Tibetan masters for the benefit of an English-speaking readership. This particular and remarkable compendium features ""The Collected Songs of the Adept Godrakpa Who is Peerless in the Three Realms"". The text is enhanced for students of Buddhism with illustrations, an informative introduction, notes on the translation, a bibliography, and an index. Hermit Of Go Cliffs is an invaluable, worthwhile, and much appreciation contribution to the expanding library of Buddhist thought and philosophy now available to western readers."
5,A different side of Zatoichi,"Zatoichi has always had an affinity for the weak, elder, children and downtrodden. Here he is the protector of an infant and pitted against the child's father in the end. Zato simple dotes on the child and the formula allows for some clever puns on the way a blind man would raise a child. Whenever children become present in Zato films I usually cringe a little, however the infant does not become terribly annoying in this film. The idea is actually quite likeable by film's end.Again, a beautifully told story with fine acting."
1,A Question of Content,"I am very interested in 'Earth From Above: 365 days', but I have one question: is '365 days' just a edited, repackaged, conciencious version of the larger 'Earth from Above'?Can anyone help me with this query?"
5,great christmas CD,"being from Louisiana this is a fun twist on classic christmas songs. FYI: all Louisianians do not talk, sound, or experience all the things in the songs...but it's entertaining all the same. Growing up my parents had the vinyl copy, and when I started my own family I was really happy to have found this on CD and able to make it a part of my family's christmases for years to come."
3,Wasn't for Our Pup,"My dog really liked this at first, but lost interest in it after a few feedings. I would highly recommend people take a look at Wysong's line of dog food."
4,Is my dog the most finicky one out there??,"I read reviews at great length before I ordered this product. I was so excited by the great reviews..I couldn't wait for it to arrive so I could give it to my finicky eater...assuming she'd just gobble it down. But no...she sniffed at it and walked away! To me, the product looks and smells delicious! I've opened and offered the food 4 or 5 times...and occasionally my stubborn viszla will eat a LITTLE...just to appease me I'm sure.So I'm writing this review so those of you who have really finicky dogs won't get TOO excited about this food. Not ALL dogs are wild over it! Mine isn't... If I ever run out of food, however, I'll probably try it myself! hahaha..."
1,Terrible phone,"The camera quality is bad, and after a few months the ear piece of the phone became unsturdy and flimsy (it would squeek while talking) and people constantly complained that I never came through clearly. I really reccomend passing over this phone- though the interface is easy to use and the screen is visible in the front, it is still the worst phone ever."
3,Great except for...,"Bad things first:The first is the voice recognition is terrible. Sometimes it won't accept what you say. Other times it brings a completely different name--not even close to what you asked for.The second thing is the text messaging software is archaic. It's too hard to navigate.On the good side--the clarity and battery life are great. This is pretty much what a cell phone should make a priority and Motorola does a good job here. the styling is fine, the phone seems solidly build (in China, no less!). So, it gets 3 stars."
1,Won't turn on!!!!,"This thing, I am seriously fed up with it. I don't know what the deal is but every few days I go to turn this phone on and it won't! It will flash and then go off. I seriously spent about SEVEN minutes this morning contstantly pressing the power button again and again and again until FINALLY it turned on. I do not recommend this phone, whatever deal you're getting it's not worth it to spend minutes a few times a week getting the thing to turn on. The phone I had several phones ago might be a dinosaur now but at least it was reliable."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!,"We ordered these phones from Cingular. They are absolute junk. My husband had to have his replaced 3 times and I had mine replaced twice. The camera would always mess up and would stay on or freeze up and you couldn't get into your phone book or even see who's calling on the caller i.d. screen. I've taken mine into a store to replace it and was told that the store didn't carry them because of all the issues with them. These are not worth the money. I had to replace mine again last week. This time I went with a Sony Ericsson Z520A Its much better and has way more options. The camera even has a 4x digital zoom. Don't buy this phone, or you will surely end up in the same boat that we did."
2,Great phone! Until it starts messing up...,"I had this phone for nearly a year with no problems, aside from the camera inexplicably stopping working. A few months ago the battery on the phone started draining within 8 hours of being fully charged. I sent for a replacement and within a few weeks it started doing it again, but this time it shuts off randomly.My brother got the same phone as me and within six months his battery was being constantly drained. He also sent for a replacement, which has worked until recently, when he started having problems with not being heard on the other end.All in all, this phone isn't worth the trouble. It will work great for awhile, then it won't, and depending on your provider, you'll be stuck with a crap phone and another year on your contract."
1,Just hope your phone never quits working,"I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off. The friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem. After the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center, they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable ""due to customer abuse."" I have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage (unless using it to make phone calls counts as ""customer abuse""), but got the same comment, without explanation after I had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation. It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty. You'll be fine with a Motorola phone as long as it works. After that, you're on your own."
1,Terrible phone!,"I bought three of these phones for my kids in December. It is now August and they have all broken. Two have screen damage and one has an antenna stripped. Also, the silver on the outside has rubbed off just from being taken in and out of a pocket. I was told the phone is still under warranty, but that if we return it and they find the damage is caused by the user, they will charge $150 for the replacement phone. Well, no phone is going to break if you put it on the shelf and leave it there. No cell phone should break from flipping a flip phone shut (as in screen damage) or from being taken in and out of a pocket. I didn't want to take even the remotest chance of having to pay even a cent for another of these awful phones, so I bought new phones. Go for Motorola V551 instead. That is a much better phone."
2,I hate this phone,"I switched from another cellular provider in December and I knew it was a mistake. I was trying to save a buck - big mistake. I'm not a big fan of Cingular and I can't tell which is worse, their service or this phone. I can barely hear out of the phone and forget it if you have the windows down in the car. The ringer is easily drowned out, even at its highest setting. And when I go to my mother's house, which is 10 min from mine, I can't use it all. The address book is set up weird; for each entry there's a separate line which is dumb. And on most phones, you can personalize the screen, not this one. I guess I was spoiled by my previous cell provider. The free phones I got from them were way better than this one, and I paid for this one. I have about 18 mos left and then it's back to my old cell service."
2,Buyer Beware!,"The camera's zoom features went out after 2 months. Now, 18 months later the camera no longer works, but I didn't use it all that much to begin with. The reception is pretty lousy and I had the typical commerical ad happen to me when during the WORST time it could happen, it went completely DEAD! As of now, I can call manually and receive calls but heaven forbid it goes into voicemail. The battery won't stay charged,the screen won't work (I get nothing but transposed gibberish)and I can't retrieve any info. I thank God my contract will be up soon. This phone is a piece of JUNK. PHOOEY!"
2,Don't bother with the V220,"My roommate and I bought the same plan from cingular three months ago, but we got different phones - she chose a Samsung phone and I chose the Motorola V220. The biggest problem I have with my phone is that it doesn't like to ring when I'm getting a call, and even when it does ring it doesn't ring long enough for me to answer. I always end up having to call the person back. Also, the V220 often has a very weak signal in places where my roommate's phone will have a full signal, and I frequently have calls dropped. This is my first motorola... and most likely my last. Don't bother buying the V220."
4,Decent.,"I like this phone. It is a huge step up from my last one, I got it for a good price, and it has many new functions that I don't know how I got along without. I like how you can change your ringtone so easily (from silent to loud or vibrate to vibrate and then ring and so on) without even opening the phone. However, those buttons can also get pressed a lot accidentally creating an obnoxious beeping sound. The phone does hold a long charge and I no longer have to put it on the charger every night like my old phone.Sometimes my service is not so good but I can only speak for my area (Baltimore) because when I was elsewhere (SC) the reception was perfect (figures).If you're looking for a decent phone that can do a lot, including take pictures, for a good price, this phone is the way to go."
2,I took it back the SAME day!,"If you're looking for a good quality picture phone I wouldn't recommend this phone. If you want to see if you're battery is charged or if you have a full signal I wouldn't recommend it. The screen is waaay tooo small and the picture quality is horrible. My husband picked up the phone for me after I told him I wanted it. I played with the phone for about an hour and then decided it had to go back. I took it back and paid the extra money for the motorola v551 which is da bomb all around!! Oh yeah, Motorola instruction booklets are the worst!"
2,Lousy,"I paid to ""upgrade"" to this cameraphone a year ago. I can say it has worked, but that is about it. The camera is so low quality that it might as well not be on the phone. Memory capacity is very low, so you won't get many shots either. MP3 ringtone support is a joke - they want you to buy additional software just to have that feature (though there's now a free alternative).Pros:MP3 RingtonesUSB PortExternal displayGood battery lifeCons:Ringer not loud enoughFinish easily scratchedCamera quality poorReception poorScreen contrast poorPhone sometimes disconnects and screen goes blank.Sometimes calls don't 'ring through' even when you have 5 bars."
2,I'm now on my third.,"I just received my second replacement for this phone in 6 months.I got this phone because I wanted a cheap phone that had the speakerphone feature. This one fit the bill.The camera really doesn't work very well, but that doesn't bother me too much. The problem with this phone is that every three months something goes wrong with it and I have to get a replacement. My friend has the same problem with a different model of Motorola phone.I just hope that this replacement lasts longer than the last one."
1,Phone is bad but Cingular is worse,"I ordered this phone and was pretty unhappy with it. The address book doesn't let you add multiple numbers to one contact, it simply makes two entries for that contact. The menus were difficult to navigate. I returned the phone within one day.What followed was even worse. I was an AT&T; customer (now Cingular). For a month after my return I attempted to upgrade to another phone, only be transferred, told to go online, told to go to the store, told to call, etc. In one month of trying to work with Cingular, not ONE single solitary person helped me in any way. I was finally told I needed to just keep my current phone because they couldn't figure out how to upgrade me.Today I left Cingular and I've never been happier. By far the worst customer service I have encountered in any industry."
1,do not buy if you have anger management issues,"I would not recomend this piece of garbage to anyone. I originally bought this phone through cingular, and it was a giant step forward from my older nokia. About 3 months into the contract, the battery stop charging, would not charge with a wall charger or car charger. Cingular sent me a new one at no cost to me as it was still under warrantee. second one came in, and had horrible reception everywhere but the cingular store (surprise surprise) Returned that one, got a third one. once again, horrible reception. Long story short, the phone is in many pieces now and i purchased a nokia and love it. I definitley would not recomend this phone to anyone with anger mangement issues, all kidding aside, this phone is horrible."
1,Horrible phone,I have two of these phones. We recieved them for free with our calling plan. One does not hold a charge and we were unable to get it replaced. I brought it to the store and was told to mail it back. I called to get the address and was told to bring it to a store nearby. I brought it back to the store and was told they could not replace it. I was told that this is a known problem with this phone.
3,"good features, small lcd, some lacking features.","Previously I had Motorola T720. It was a very good phone and I lost it and got V180 and also tried V220. the only difference is that 220 has a camera.Pros: quad mode, speaker phone, I liked regular connector for charger the 720 comes with a proprietary one which stop making proper contact after some initial use, not reliable.Cons: I hate the small lcd, no icons displayed for selecting soft keys, the entries are very limited with no icons for home, cell etc.. you need to type them along with name."
4,Works sometimes,"I've used this on a car that had the rotten egg smell and it cleaned up nicely. I used it on a car with no smell but a engine code indicating a low efficiency catalytic converter and it didn't work. For the price versus the cost of replacing the cat, it's worth a shot."
1,doesnt work,"didnt work had replace catalytic after use , it clogged it made it worse . no i wouldnt recommend it"
2,Useless,It doesn't really help clean the catalytic converter.The product says it might help pass the smog check. So it is useless.
4,work good,I feel this was worth the chance because the light on the car kept going on and the idle was a little hi and rough so instead of spending $400 i tried to clean the catalitic converter out and it worked. the car runs smoother now and the check engine light stayed off
3,Car ran smoother but did not eliminated my Check Engine light.,Car ran smoother but did not eliminated my Check Engine light.I had to eventually install an O2 sensor B1S1 which I also bought on Amazon. That did the trick for the Engine Light.My wife did note however that it did make the car run smoother.
1,Converter Cleaner does not work,I used this product in my 06 Chevy Silverado with the 5.3 V-8. I have had a malfunction code for the catalytic converter on one side not working properly. If I clear the code it comes back in a few miles. I used this product as directed and it made no change.
4,Tried it,"Was told I needed a catalytic converter so I gave this stuff a try, however turns out I only drove my truck 4000 miles last year so it was exempt. My converter was making a noise however does not make the noise anymore, so I guess this stuff cleaned it out."
3,Catalytic Converter Cleaner,"Product seems like it would would work, but my cat converter was to far gone."
3,"It does tame, but not as described","On the label, it says that applying a little when your hair is damp will help to tame it, but it has never worked for me at all that way.It DOES help a little when my hair is dry, but not my natural texture very much. Much more straight.I like it and it helps, but it doesn't do what it says it does and so depending on your texture it may or may not be of any help."
1,Elmer's glue for hair,"After 39 years of struggling with natural curly hair, I have learned one important thing..if you want to straighten your hair it has to be healthy. I have tried every product on the market, and was sucked in by the promise of silky, shiny hair with Chi products. I put it in my hair and started to blow it dry, then the ends knotted up. My hair felt like it had glue in it! It was horrible. I immediately ran to wash it out. Trust me, this stuff is like liquid aqua net and can't be healthy for your hair. Use Morrocan oil and be done with it!"
2,No difference!,I'm not impressed with this smoothing cream. I can't see any difference at all when I use this. I won't be buying it again.
2,Smells like a Guy...,"Hey guys I read your reviews and got the product because some of you guys say it did wonders and smelled good that you would even buy it as a perfume... But when I got it I noticed that it smelled like something a guy would wear. For me I don't like smelling like one so I rated it very low but i put 2 stars because my hair did feel a little smoother then usually but not much (I put a lot on, 2 big squirts and I only got medium length hair...so maybe the people who said it works probably uses a lot or mixes with other products) I'm definitely changing to another one that has a better smell. Any recommendations please let me know^^."
2,"Smells wonderful, but dried-out my hair","I bought this hearing it was from a great brand, but after i would apply it after shampooing and conditioning, i'd see it wouldn't really moisturize my hair or do anything particularly special to it, even after i would flat iron it. It made my hair feel unusually dry after i would let my hair air dry, which I can't have since i relax my hair, and it certainly didn't maintain my hair straight. The biggest upside honestly is that it smells wonderful and holds well in damp hair for a little while.In the end i don't know if you had to have just gotten your hair done or something for it to take effect but it didn't do much for my long, relaxed hair. Perhaps some of their other products are good, but i don't recommend this straight guard as a first choice at all."
3,I found something better!,"I thought this product would be so much better! I won't be buying this anymore. In stead, I prefer the Chi Silk Infusion or the BioSilk Silk Therapy."
3,..,"I recieved this product very soon (2 days) which was very good, but when I recieved it the product was all over the outside of the bottle, and it was open. This was suppose to be brand new. Other than that, it works great!"
5,Chi Straight Gaurd .. great purchase,I really love how easy it was to order what I wanted and have it delivered right to my front door! Great shopping experience!East Tex. : )
3,nothing special,"Chi hair products are just like any other salon hair product. It's over priced, for being so average"
3,Not a great recording.,"This one is only for die-hard GENTLE GIANT fans like myself.The sound is horrible(Gary Green's guitar is inaudible half the time), but the song selection is interesting.It's nice to hear live renditions of the songs from CIVILIANand the biggest surprise may be GIANT FOR A DAY. The versionhere has more keyboards than it's studio counterpart. It's alsonice to hear PLAYING THE GAME from POWER AND THE GLORY. The per-formances by the band can't be faulted, but it sure would havebeen nice if the recording quality was better. Still, the linernotes are very informative and entertaining and I like the photoof DEREK SHULMAN wearing the mask from GIANT FOR A DAY.The five man percussion jam is cool, but I find it disappointingthat they kept it almost the same after all them years of doingit in concert.Anyhow, fans of GENTLE GIANT during their later years will eatthis up like cereal!I'm giving the album threestars because I really love this band and really like their CIV-ILIAN album."
3,"5 For Comfort, 1 For Smell, 3 for How Long It Stays Warm","When I ordered this neck-wrap I believed it would smell the way previous neck-wraps I've owned have - herbal, soothing, relaxing. While this wrap can get really, really warm, and while it's very comfortable around the neck, it stinks like dog's butt. It stinks so badly I have to purposefully try and concentrate on something else while wearing it. If you've never spelled warm flax seed (which smells like warm something else), I don't suggest it. Find something that's both comfortable and sweet smelling."
2,If you're sensitive to smell might want to rethink!,I had a bucky neck pillow I wanted to substitute because I had nuked it one too many times (but I loved it and used it for a year before the burn holes made it unusable--and I couldn't get free shipping on it) and this seemed like a great one to try. I was so excited to put it to use and I read the reviews about smell and thought how bad could it be? It's really strong and to me makes me nauseous. I had bought 2 to give one as gift but will have to return! I cannot get past the smell!! I can't even describe it. It also is heavier than what I expected .Sorry I really was rooting for this!
1,"Microwavable? Hah, it caught on fire in the microwave after 6 weeks","Do not buy this product. I was replacing one from a different manufacture that my wife had for several years. I bought this for her for Christmas. After 6 weeks, it caught fire in the microwave."
5,Sure helped my neck,I had a neck issue and when I needed to have the cold it helped and I was not using ice bags that can leak everywhere. I use this for heat as well it sure helps with relaxation after a stressful day. I just pop it in the microwave and I am set for watching my favorite program after a hard day at work.
5,Love love!!!,I have had this for over a year now and can't live without it. I have a bAd neck and use this as an additional support with a pillow. I love the relief I get from it. The stitches have cone apart some but make sure not to overheat it for more than three minutes. Enjoy!
5,great walking shoe,"Pretty plain, but somehow stylish, and so comfortable. I walked on cobblestones for two weeks in Rome, a generally excruciating experience! These shoes were by far the most stable of the three pair I brought on the trip and the latex gave so much extra cushioning. This is my 3rd pair of Arche shoes and they are definitely worth the extra cost."
5,Great Clock!!!,This clock is really good compared to the price. It has been giving accurate time upto now and is elegant to look at. It is worth buying.
3,Westclox Middleton,"I got it via mail and it was broken where the wood frame is. I like the clock, and don't have time for returns, so i glue the frame and put it on the wall. But I did not like the fact that the new clock for 20 bucks came broken. IK"
1,Wow,Ms. Johnson is wow. She really wrote an extraordinary book here. Her sections is almost as compelling as the tv show 24.
5,Another compilation?,"Another compilation? If there isn't new material, why don't make a compilation of her rare songs instead? The song from mannequin 'In my wildest dreams' for example, or what about 'God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen' (Very nice) or 'One By One' from the soundtack of The Harvest, 'I won't say i'm in love' (both versions) from Hercules, Bless the Beasts and Children, Dancing In The City, I Wouldn't Be Here If I Didn't Love You, Submission, etc, etc.And what about a compilation of her videos? (ALL OF THEM!) when? WHEN?"
1,Great if you live in the Bible Belt,"There is some interesting info in the first pages, but then it goes way off the deep end with all the religious conservative nonsense. Satan, Halloween, covens, secular humanists, and on and on. I'm sure she voted for McCain. My sister might like this book, but for me it was a waste of money."
5,Revolutionary and Insightful Book On Emotional Healing!,"What an insightful book! Anne has such a wonderful humor in dealing with life's most serious problems and hurts. This book should be read by everyone--- married, single and old, but especially young. For those newly engaged or pre-engaged couples, this is a book that must be read and worked through. Counselors and pastors of all denominations could use this effectively as a primary pre-marital counseling book! Anne's book will be in our libraries for constant review and as a gift to others. All of us have relationship issues whether we are married or not. This will help many come to grips with who they are and why they do, say and react the way they do. The book gives us not only the knowledge ,but also a way of receiving healing that is needed."
3,Neat thing for a fan to have.,"This CD has the single Land of Confusion (4.43 min), the Extended Version (6.55), and the songs Feeding the Fire (5.54) and Do the Neurotic (7.0). Includes lyric sheet (Do the Neurotic is an instrumental). Definately a neat thing to have if you're a Genesis fan...the casual fan probably won't appreciate as much, but the Phil-era Genesis will want to get this one, if just to say you have it."
4,Always,"my husband loves this movie. I found the language less then desirable in places,but it was worth watching"
4,Grate Movie,"This movie is great. It has some action, love & comedy. My dad helped build the plane that Richard flies for the movie. It's a must see flick."
3,Humerous but not realistic,"The acting and the theme of the movie are alright, but the back drop could have been done in any occupation; police, doctor, soldier, etc.Being a former firefighter and air tanker base manager, the film does not do justice to forest firefighters. In fact it is really insulting to the profession and unrealistic."
3,Dissapointing,"Spielberg's remake of ""A Guy Named Joe"" was truly dissapointing because of one unexpressive actor: Brad Johnson. But Mr. Dreyfuss, Mrs. Hunter and Mr. Goodman really save the day. Don't forget to watch over and over again the opening sequence, as well the fire scenes."
1,Always,"This Company Sucks!! Do not Buy, We got stuck with a Region 2 DVD who Knew about DVD's not playing in certain regions. What a Load of BS. Pauly......"
2,Wait for it on Blu-Ray or wait for a TRUE Wide-Screen Release,"I love this movie. I love it. But this is a bad DVD. Technically it's widescreen, but it doesn't adapt to widescreen TVs. This means that you'll have black bars on all four sides of your screen. The sound is also lacking. The planes need to be louder. Bone rattling loud! Anyhow, if it wasn't for me really needing an Always fix, I'd pass this one up and wait for a real DVD or Blu-Ray. Ideally, this movie gets a really good Blu-Ray treatment. I'd buy it."
5,Great Action Remance Movie,Finally a remake of an old movie that is better than the original. Wonderful action with the fire and the planes. The chemistry between the characters is great. You really laugh and cry with them.
5,Old love story,This movie was recommended to me. It is a great love story and has some wonderful aviation scenes for those who love old planes.
4,A Wonderful Flight of Fancy,"This move could be described by any number of negatives, including the incredible fact that it is a Steven Spielberg film? That said, those people are not the target audience for this wonderful sleeper movie starring three incredible talents in Dreyfuss, Goodman and Hunter. Few movies can so easily move you from sadness to laughter and back so seamlessly, all the time rooting for a happy ending for all the characters. Even if one is dead. ALWAYS ranks right up at the top with other 'feel good' movies like Sleepless in Seattle."
4,anamorphic,"Great movie, but it should be available in ""anamorphic"" or ""enhanced for widescreen tv"" format for today's 16x9 widescreen HDTV. Better yet, how about a widescreen Blu ray edition? To view the current 1:85.1 aspect ratio DVD properly on HDTV (filling the entire screen) I have to set the HDMI DVD player on ""480P"" and use the ""full"" screen setting. Furthermore, I must adjust the HDTV itself to ""zoom"" and reduce the ""sharpness"" setting to about level 3 to keep the picture from being too grainy. Call me a sentamentalist, perhaps that is what I am but I like this movie. As a single, straight male I have always dreamed of having a loving relationship with a woman, but this dream has always eluded me. I guess that is why I find this story to be so beautiful. However, until it becomes available on anamorphic wide screen or, better yet, Bluray I will not be purchasing it. Come on Spielberg, get with it and release ""Always"" on anamorphic DVD and/or Bluray!"
5,Always,I haven't gotten to watch this movie yet but it is movie my husband and I have always enjoyed. I am so glad just to have it.
1,Always DVD,"I am very unhappy about this product. Always is one of my favorite movies, but when I tried to watch the DVD, it wouldn't play because it was for a different location. I have never heard of that before, but because of that, I have wasted my money and the product is useless to me. At the very least, I would like my money refunded."
4,Always,""" Always"" This is very entertaining, but it is strictly fantasy. Richard Dreyfuss character is killed in an accident and comes back from the dead to help his girlfriend. He has to learn to communicate with her since of course he is a ghost.Enjoyable if you don't mind it being about something that is impossible."
4,fire bomber,"Are you a fan of aerial fire bombing? If not, this will make you one. Lots of round engines, sounds of Pratt and Whitneys, smoke and of course, fire. There is a love story too, isn't there always? Enjoy."
4,Fun & Cute,"Rather funny flick featuring an incredibly good-looking guy from New York City (playing the role of a heterosexual). In searching for a place to live, he comes across a personal ad with the code GWM. Thinking this means ""Guy With Money"", he moves in. The ensuing tale is cute and funny as the two come to terms living with each other! Plays out the stereotypes fairly well. Mixes, Brooklyn, Broadway and ""The Sound of Music"" very well. Could have done without the father in the bathroom scene at the theater. By no means the quality or intensity of ""Torch Song Trilogy"", but a well-done mainstream movie that deals with gays and straights very well. If you liked ""Trick"" or ""The Birdcage"", you should enjoy this movie (and vice-versa)."
1,Can we all say cliche?,"One of the worse gay films I've seen. I'd rather go shopping, and you should too before buying or renting this movie."
1,"Kiss Me, Guido","I've been wanting to see this movie ever since I got a glimpse of the adorable actor Nick Scotti on the cover of the video. But I found out that this seems principally aimed at the most pee-brained straight man and uses every stereotype in the book: the gay men are all flaming and affected and trying-to-be, and the straight men are all just naturally hot. Every gay character in this film fits a stereotypically macho straight image of what gay people are, and you can tell because the acting on both sides is very forced and very rarely funny. I was wincing most of the time. This film is an insult both to gay people and to straight Italian men. Stay away from this turkey."
3,Can a straight Bronx man live with a clean gay man?,"After catching his brother having sex with his girlfriend, Frankie (Nick Scotti) is upset (no marriage now) and feels he must move out of Brooklyn. He ends up in a room-for-rent situation. So he decides to live with Warren (Anthony Barrile). He later finds out Warren is gay. But Frankie is a straight Bronx, a Guido. Both are in a financial situation and the apartment is nice, so Frankie stays the night. Can this odd couple possibly live together and make it work? Watch out for that landlord (Molly Price, NBC tv-series ""Third Watch"") She's a ball-buster. Followed by the short-lived CBS tv-series, ""Some of My Best Friends"" (2001), starring Jason Bateman and Danny Nucci."
