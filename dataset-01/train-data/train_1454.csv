5,Light and deep at the same time,"I really enjoyed this book, it was light but heavy at the same time as it covered major life dilemmas. Couldn't put it down once I started!"
4,good lite entertainment with a few lessons,Some reviewers seem to disconnect from this book. Overall it is fun with a few lessons thrown in honesty being right up there. Having read this one I want to try some more by this author.
5,Super fast!,"Description and quality of the book were wonderful. Very honest about condition. When I received it, it was better than I had anticipated and the price was more than a bargain. But what really impressed me about this seller was the speed of the shipping. They must have sent it out same day because I received it within 3 days. I was amazed! Would definitely buy from them again if need be in the future. Thank you for such a great experience."
2,Boring and unrealistic,"I loved Confessions of a Shopaholic and this is just definitely not the same caliber. I heard that the Madeleine Wickham books deal with more ""serious"" issues but not very believably. If you want a happy ending with no apparent character development then this is the book for you. Just not for me."
3,Did not like the reader,"I liked the book and the story but I really did not like Katherine Kellgren. Ordinarily I really enjoy books on CD but I really had a hard time getting through this one. First of all, the narrator spoke as though she were narrating some sort of mystery or disaster, the way her voice rose when speaking in her own voice, i.e. not the dialog. Actually the dialog was pretty good but it was what was in between that I really did not like. And when she would say something like, ""Millie said,"" she would say it so quickly that it plain sounded ridiculous. She may be a well-respected narrator, but I will, from now on, avoid any book narrated by her."
4,RSVP YES to the Wedding Girl,"With secrets and unexpected plot twists galore, the Wedding Girl is an entertaining read you won't want to put down. The main character, Milly makes some questionable decisions when confronted with a secret from her past that may prevent her from marrying the man she loves. As the stress from Milly's past grows, it creates problems that seep into the lives of her loved ones and friends. The author, Madeline Wickham, does a great job of bringing each character and their anguish vividly to life on each page. I highly recommend this book."
3,Entertaining . . . until the end!,"This book was a fairly easy, entertaining read until the close to the end when silly subplots were introduced that added nothing to the story. I was disappointed with the ending as it left too much unresolved."
3,Lighthearted chick lit,"While I've read every one of Wickhams books - including all the Sophie Kinsella. I must say this isn't my favorite, nor is it the worst. In true Wickham fashion you have the main character who like a lot of us out there, put off what needs to be done until it's almost too late. While there were parts that made me laugh, there were sections I wish I could jump into the book and slap a few characters. Easy read and recommended for any Chick-Lit lover."
2,Not Madeleine Wickman (AKA Sophie's) best book,To be honest this book does not come close to Sophie's previous books. It's lacks the witt and charm that her Shopaholic Series produced. I struggled to get into the characters and really found it drab.
5,One of the more thoughful 'rock' books to have been assembled....,"Talking Heads are very much missed - and along with their still-amazing recordings, this late 1980s volume is a must-have for any fan of the group. Approriating the concept behing The Beatles' ILLUSTRATED LYRICS, David Byrne and graphic artist Frank Olinsky (currently best known for his work with the magazine 'Tricycle') invite a broad array of the best contemporary artists (1980s) to interpret various songs by Talking Heads.The results were assembled with lyrics (published in justified columns, newspaper-style) facing each artwork. Artists involved include Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Sue Coe, Jenny Holzer, Barbara Krueger, Russell Mills (famed for his own similar project with Brian Eno, MORE DARK THAN SHARK) and others. The finished product remains one of the more thoughtful rock 'books' to have ever been assembled.A must for culture geeks, or Talking Heads fans.-David Alston"
1,not informative,i find this book lacks information it mostly has other peoples experiences but it is not interesting and the set up of the book is not user friendly. also it is very vague with lack of information.
2,Not Impressed with this one!,"I read some raving reviews about this book, but I admit, I was quite disappointed. Factual, I'm sure, but it lacks details and tries to touch on too much without going into any depth. Many other pregnancy books go into further detail."
5,The Adlers have done it again -- to perfection!,"This book is a remake of the famous and huge best-seller, ""Kids Letters from Camp"" written more than 40 years ago. In this modern version, ""Kids E-Mail and Letters from Camp"" Bill Adler Jr., son of Bill Adler, has captured the sweetness, poignancy and side-splitting humor of what kids send home via the internet as well as through written letters and postcards. Just as the original reflected the 1950s, this book reflects our current life. (Read both and you'll see some amazing changes in our society.) For example, yesterday's asked for 'CARE"" packages with candy. Today's kids are asking for their parents to send them new and interesting fonts for their computers at camp. Some things are the same, though. Kids still won't eat their vegetables."
1,Waste of time,"I cant' really write a review since they never sent my merchandise. All I can say is, I will never (try to) purchase from them again."
3,Average music from a band that never really hit big,"Well, here it is ""Just a Taste"". It's nothing too original. Sounds like a lot of bands music now days. Too bad Miljenko couldn't stay teamed up with Zakk Wilde. That was some awesome music they made for the Rock Star movie. While I'm on the Rock Star movie, how manay times are they going to re-record 'We All Die Young'?? It was on 2000's Wait, the Rock Star soundtrack and now here it is again on ""Just a Taste"". Come on guys!! The version on the Rock Star soundtrack is the best BY FAR!!For now, I say if this is ""just a taste"" I'll pass on the full course..."
3,Steelheart CD,"I love Steelheart, so I thought I would buy this CD. I must admit I was a little disappointed. The music just isn't up to their usual caliber. While it's not bad, I had expected something a little more phenominal."
2,Long Wait,"I have been wating for this product for a long time, more than 2 years. I do feel that the ballads, are the ones that are better for this artist. He has some awesome ballads, and I became a big fan thanks to this songs. But, so far, in this sample cd, I didn't listen to any song that I could be impressed, like before. So I hope the rest of the album is going to be better in that matter."
2,Nahin could have done better...,"Although Dr. Nahin may be a seasoned explorer of ideas involving time travel, his failure to used organized paragraphs and effective examples greatly lowered the value of this how-to book.Nahin also omitted the concept of parallel universes entirely. (A now popular belief, that as soon as a traveler breaks his own space-time barrier and moves back in time, the universes splits into two identical entities, the original universe where you came from is the one you can never return to. This may sound disheartening, but this is the only conceivable way in which the time traveler would not induce changes in histories, and therefore time paradoxes.)Books like this deserve to be better."
2,not well-written,I did not get what I was hoping for. I wanted a book that would make a very complex subject much more easily understood. Instead I got something dense and impenetrable. I'll have to continue my search for a book that makes time travel more easily understood by the layman. This wasn't it...
2,Felt nothing,I didn't feel that this product delivered as it said. I didn't see much if any change at all after 2 weeks of taking the product.
2,Didn't give me energy.,"I bought this product hoping it would give me some energy. It did not, and it tastes like grass. Although it is probably a good source of vegetables."
1,A disappointment,"Hard to believe this collection in 32 pages is really based on Amish ways. While I am not Amish and don't know a whole lot about their goings on, I find it hard to believe Pineapples (required in at least a couple recipes) grow in Ohio/Pennsylvania (or is their an Amish family living in Hawaii?). Some recipes called for orange and Strawberry jello, commercially prepared mayonaise, and a freezer (to store pickles in). This leads me to think the authors know less than I do about the Amish."
5,Oh my!,This is a page turner. The flawed main character is so real and so complex. When I love the first ten pages of a book I read it in one setting. Sue Miller's book had me from page one.
3,Fair Book,This story was interesting but just not what I thought it would be. The ending was not what it could have been. Miller gave an ending you typically do not see. Most books leave the best for last but she just tapers at the end. The book was not bad or I would not have finished it. Read it if you please you will find parts interesting.
3,"great story, so so execution","i liked the story very much - it was real.however, her writing style/delivery was a bit (boring). it could've been a bit spicier - though i realise its not in the romance category - didn't feel much passion in the main character.that said: worth reading"
4,realistic,"For those of you who didn't like this book, you must be too young to understand the complexities that life will eventually hold. Miller expertly shows the inner conflict you can have between your romanticized younger life and the reality of what your life is today. I felt it was a very enjoyable book - I couldn't put it down until I finished it."
2,Why?,"Why does this woman have no friends? no one to say ""You'll never guess!"" or ""my daughter's a brat"" to me this makes the book phony. ""The Pilot's Wife"" was the same. I think it is just plain lazy of the author. If this woman was real she would have friends, or a friend, and would have discussed things! Granted she was a loner, but by no means was she so extreme that she should have no-one. I don't mean to obsess, but people doen't make such HUGE choices without talking to anyone!They just don't."
3,While I Was Gone,"An odd book about a successful woman named Jo who ran into the wife of an old flame. The meeting causes her to reflect back to a time when she was young and a free-spirit living in the 1960's. At that time she lived in a house, a commune-like setting that was shared with other young people, many of whom were students. As she reflects back, she is forced to remember the murder of one of her dear friends. The murder happened in the house one nite when the friend was alone with the old flame. She now has reason to suspect the old flame... how will it be if she confronts him now?"
5,engrossing,"This book captured my attention for a number of reasons; the quality of writing, character development and story progression are all outstanding. It also related directly to my age group--the story of a mid-life woman, secure in a job and marriage, suddenly jolted into remembering the woman she used to be, before becoming the wife, mother and successful career woman she is now. The descriptions the author gives, of emotions, of family relationships, and of the things one values in life, are unbeatable, and speak directly to those things we each hold dear."
2,"DULL, DULL, DULL",This is certainly not one of her better books. The pace moved like a snail and I found the characters to be utterly boring.Forget this one!
5,A new Sue Miller fan.,"I had never read Sue Miller before, but this book was excellent. I couldn't put it down. I admit, when I first purchased this book, it didn't take. But a few weeks later I gave it another go, and I loved it. It has a twist that I didn't expect, (which is good of course), and the characters seemed very well put together and real."
2,I Didn't Get It,"Why would the protaganist dare to throw away a perfectly good and loving marriage to have an adventure with a guy she sort of knew way back when? It's not as if she had loved him, and, furthermore, hadn't seemed to be attracted to him when they were young. One point against the plot.Second point: Eli's confession was so silly. Why now? Why to her? What was the point?Third point: I'm no prude and I've read the best of them, but what did the heavy sex scene with her husband add to the plot. It seemed that Miller's editor told her to throw a couple of pages of heavy panting into a boring book in order for it to sell.Sorry - Miller has done better."
2,WAS EXPECTING MORE,"I enjoyed some parts of this book but I have to say, I was a bit disappointed. It seemed much too wordy for me and I found the end anti-climatic."
3,didn't add up for me,"The book started off strongly, and it was interesting to look at the main character's offbeat past in light of her now-mainstream life. Her memories of living in a bohemian household that ended tragically are the best part of the book.However, events and characters in her current life ultimately struck me as unbelievable. Her minister husband is deeply offended by a conversation with a nonbeliever... and yet she and her children are not religious either? She suddenly decides on a course of action that could destroy her marriage, which is still fun and sexy after 20+ years? Plot points like this rang false for me, and ultimately I found the book just so-so."
3,A REAL PAGE TURNER,"It seems that Jo has the perfect husband, the perfect family, a wonderful home and a great career, but she is willing to risk it all because she thinks that something is missing in her life. I found this story to be at times very realistic, as she describes her emotions and how she felt about her life, and her past. And yet quite disturbing as she goes after what she thinks will make her happy and the shocking outcome of it all."
3,"Enchanting narrative, but missing pieces","The discovery of self and the power of self is the journey that this book seemed to promise. But, from beginning to end, the character comes short at anchoring us to what is missing in her life; and at the end, we don't know if she is fulfilled, despite the lessons her life decisions offers her. One never feels the rise and fall of her character; she seems to be meandering throughout her life-satisfied with only moments-not learning the definition and satisfaction of her life as a whole-one doesn't see the ""big picture."" Readers may loose empathy for her at certain moments as she just simply feels sorry for herself; by in large, people don't admire that quality. However, there is no question that Sue Miller is well versed at describing implicit nuances of experience and the absence of ""something."" The joy of this book falls in the enjoyment of the pattern in the words."
4,THE MISSING PIECE OF THE PUZZLE,"Sue Miller takes a mundane subject like reuniting with an old house mate, and gives it enough unexpected variation to make it interesting and believable. Jo, the once 20ish free spirit, is now in her 50s, a veterinarian, a mother, and the wife of a minister. By a series of coincidences, she runs into an old friend, Eli, and he solves a 30 year old murder mystery (in a way she doesn't expect). Her actions from that point forward teach two valuable lessons, that Eli isn't the person she remembers and that her own emotions can't be trusted. Jo, at times is an unsympathetic character, but, while reading this book, I kept thinking, aren't we all."
1,Utterly Devoid of any Style,"This book is absolutely stupid! It really is a horribly boring storyline punctuated by the pathetic ""insights"" and emotions of its main character, Jo. I recommend leaving it on the shelf and buying another boook that's worth reading!"
2,While I Was Gone,I really did not enjoy the story. I found the main character to be weak and unaware of all that was right with her life. I didn't like all the thoughts of infidelity either. Her husband should have left her.
1,boring,"I part with the majority of reviewers of this book, who responded so favorably, and agree with reviewer EM Otis. This novel, in my opinion, grinds to a halt after the first couple chapters, which begin quite auspiciously. The impressive blurbed reviews on the book cover drew me in; I was ready to succumb. But alas, sooner than I expected, the first yawn occurred, followed by more yawns at an alarmingly increased rate. The plot, such as it was, proceeded way too slowly. I have a serious sleep disorder, and this book ultimately was more effective in addressing it than the Ambien and Benadryl I take on a regular basis. Apologies to all Sue Miller fans, but my first exposure to her work was disappointing. To all potential readers of this novel, I caution you: Do not read any portion of this book, and then drive, until a good half-hour has passed."
4,Very real characters....,"I enjoyed this book and found it very real and relatable.It's a story of a woman about to enter the empty-nest syndrom and she starts to actually have mental time to herself. This thinking time has Jo reflecting on her past and the events that made her the woman she is.Jo thinks about her very good friend that was brutally murdered. She also thinks about all of the ""what ifs"" that being in your 50s brings to your mind.Jo tries to share her thoughts and feelings with Daniel, her wonderful husband, but his responses just don't make her happy.It's a story of the all-American family and the situations between a strong willed child, an accomedating child, and a sucessful child with their parents.It's a great book. I highly reccommend it to women who grew up in the 60s and 70s and also to all career women. It's also a great book for anyone to read and maybe get a better idea of how things were growing up back then."
1,While I was plugging throught this bomb...,"What a disappointment! This book was so frustrating I actually threw it down when I finished. The characters were horribly one dimensional and difficult to understand. The daughters were each a stereotype: the goody-goody, the hellraiser and the snotty rich one. Jo, the main character, made odd decisions in regards to keeping all kinds of personal information secret even when she knew it was hurting her family. Her choices were all bad and unconvincing because they seemed to clash with her character. The worst part of this book is by far the confession of the killer. Why would he meet her in a bar and confess to a murder that happened thirty years ago, just out of the blue? Save yourself a lot of time and frustration and pick a better book to read."
3,While I was Gone,"I found myself let down by this book. I did not feel connected to the characters or their relationships at all. The beginning of the book moved faster than the middle and end. The plot dragged. As the climax drew near I had already figured out what was about to happen. Overall, I found the book to be dull with a lot of unimportant information that dragged along."
1,Not good,"I wasn't really impressed with this book. It was so dull that I stopped reading after page 20. Furthermore, adultery is wrong. No matter how we like to romanticize it these days."
1,288 pages! Sheesh!,"This was just incredibly too long for such a short paraphrasing possibilty for a book. I mean seriously, write a poem with this - ""Women can find themselves if they try, and I believe in certain ways to accomplish this."" Or make it a little shorter with ""---."""
2,"Miller, simply put, did not make my day with this novel.","I believe that this book was a little too wordy, but with a basic story such as this one, it had lots of potential. If Sue Miller keeps working at it, she could really put out something of value."
4,This book keeps getting better!,"I wasn't sure I was going to like this book after reading the first couple of pages, but I began to like it more and more as I continued to read on. Don't give up if you don't get hooked on page one. The main character is so easy to identify with and I loved her honesty and imperfections. Parents will identify with Jo Becker, and married women will identify with her too. I really felt like I knew Jo and empathized with her pain.Easy to read, yet a quality book!"
1,A real time waster,I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did! I thought the characters were uninteresting to say the least and all I wanted was to get finished with it.
1,While I Was Gone...escaped me!,"I usually give a book 50 pages...by then it's a ""go"" or ""no go""!On this one I stopped at page 47...just didn't seem to be going anywhere. I don't like to work that hard at reading! Sorry!"
3,Feminests take a stand!,"I think this book portrays women as weak, helpless human beings. Women do not need to depend on their husbands for everything. Take a stand! This is wrong! Should we be stuck in the kitchen wearing aprons? NO!Actually, I'm just joshin' with ya. This book was awesome, or was it? You be the judge. I rather enjoyed this book."
4,Lyrical Book about a womans encounter with age & life,When I finished this book I was sad to part with Jo. I felt her character was well developed and as a middle life woman some of her ideas are similar to mine. I would have liked to see a better development of the character of Eli.
4,Unresolved issues come back to haunt Joey,"At age 52, Joey discovers old, unresolved issues from her young adult hood coming back to haunt her. At the same time, this book is a tour de force of a 30-year old marriage and what can go terribly wrong and what can go terribly right"
2,Eli? and Daniel? Boring characters,"It seems Miller decided to stick with the saintly spouse vs. the slick creep who impassions the devoted wife formula. How boring and cliched for such an accomplished writer. It would have also helped if she had used as much character development on her would-be lover as she did on her fascinating daughter (Cass) I understand that Cass represents all the glory and confusion of the writers youth. However, this is not enough to make it plausible that she would sacrafice her marriage to recapture these fleeting feelings. I only remember exchanges between her and Eli a few times. He seemed like a jerk, especially when he was patronizing Daniel in their conversation about religion....And then BAM he's a murderer. It's just way to easy and does not ring true that he'd confess over drinks in the Ritz bar. I do love her writing;it is lyrical. I'm just disappointed in the story."
4,What a wonderful reading experience!,I really enjoyed this book; I couldn't put it down.. The way she describes our heroine's dearest and deepest thoughts is not only descriptive but thought provoking. A wonderful story that should hit home for all women.
4,Beautiful writing,"Joey Becker is feeling as if she's floating, between two worlds, restless. And then her life is turned upside down when a man from her past comes back in to her life. She learns secrets that affect her to her very being. Beautiful writing, always impressed. By the author of the Good Mother, a book that left a huge impression on me."
3,Had potential but disappointed,"Perplexing. How can fine writing and insightful character development render a boring novel with unlikable characters? Jo was not a sympathetic heroine but she was believable and clearly drawn but Daniel? It was as if being a minister was just a job. There was a total lack of understanding of how central Jesus would be throughout their life. If Sue Miller didn't want to go there, why make him a minister? And the daughters are Hollywood fiction material. There was an interesting plot that couldn't quite survive the endless narration. Overall, I was disappointed because it had so much potential."
2,Not So Enthralled,"This was my second Sue Miller book. I loved The Good Mother so I was eager to read this book.I was disappointed. I didn't like Jo at all. She seemed flighty and immature. She wants constant angst, and I cannot relate to that. She is yearning for something she will not find outside of herself. I was more concerned about her husband.The pace at the beginning of the book was good, as many other reviewers have said. When I reached the middle of the book I had to put it down several times for several days because of the frustration with Jo and the slowness. I was tempted to skip parts, but stuck with it.I don't think I'll ever read another Sue Miller book again. I'll stick with Jodi Picoult."
2,"In one word, DULL","I forced myself through this whole book, hoping at some point it would get better, but it never did. The characters (especially the men) had no dimension. The only character well developed was Jo's murdered friend. The story of Jo's daughters added nothing to the story, and seemed to do nothing but make the book longer. The ending was very anticlimactic. There are much better books out there right now. Pass on this one."
3,okay,"I'm trying to diversify my reading. Chose this one based solely on blurbs.Writing is good, competent, but not magical or even making me want to anxiously flip the pages.The character is a bit cliched...and there is too much telling and self-examination used to move the story forward.If Miller had chosen to delve into a relationship crisis, I think Jo and Dana would have been much more interesting...much more interesting to follow and see how it resolves itself. Miller skimmed the surface of possibilities with those two, but then didn't ultimately ""go there"", as another reviewer said.I read some of Miller's bio and it seems she definitely tries to write what she knows...An okay read redeemed by good writing and a few memorable scenes."
3,reviting it was not,"This book, in a word, was enjoyable. I wouldn't tell my bestfriend that she HAS to read this, I wouldn't tell her to stear clear either. It began okay and picked up when we flashed back to her days in Cambridge. When we were back though, it seemed to continue this build up but it did not have the bang that I felt we deserved. I liked the book, don't get me wrong but it didn't keep me up past my bed time like a good but should."
4,I love this Book!,"I have read this novel at different stages in my life 22, 27, 30 and love the descriptive pros used to describe a marriage. She describes women desires about wanting to feel young and free, yet feeling constrain from society to be conformed to a marriage even if it is a good marriage overall. It resonated and left an impression. Especially because she didn't ""sugar coat"" how flawed humans are, and hard topics all families deal with. Very poignant and intelligent!"
4,great read,Sue does an excellent job of drawing the reader into the characters with vivid details of the main characters surroundings. At certain times I felt like I was the character.
3,Just Okay,I had a hard time liking this book and its main character. Something about Jo and why she did things just didn't quite make sense to me. If you're thinking of reading this borrow it. It certainly is good writing style to read and I think it definitely does have an audience it does appeal to. Just wasn't my cup of tea!
3,While I Was Gone,"This book was okay. I am usually a big fan of Oprah's Book Club, however, I felt this one kind of dragged. It was very hard to have a feel for the characters. The book is also VERY predictable."
1,Beyond dull - contains spoiler,"Started well enough with the characters sharing the house. Once the 'action' moved onto the later years and her marriage it became tedious with large amounts of the book describing her husband/kids/job/mother. All the while it was completely obvious that Eli was the killer. Tedious, very ..."
1,While I Was Gone,"If you have a lot in common with the narrator (professional class woman/vaguely dissatisfied with everything), AND you don't like to think while you read, you may enjoy this book.Normally, I would give a book 2 stars just for being able to reach people (which this does), but I can't because it was full of pretentious language and meandering descriptions/anecdotes which didn't really contribute to the plot or the characters. Also, it was poorly researched.If you like reading about somewhat depressing family life and relationships, I recommend reading something by Ann Tyler instead (I actually don't like her either, but she's good at what she does.)The Amateur Marriage (Tyler, Anne (Large Print))"
3,"While She Was Gone, I Found Something Better...","No, really. I did finish this book, but it was tough. The story is pretty much based on the idea that whenever something gets tough in Jo's life, she leaves that life for a while. She left her first husband and lived in a quasi-commune for a while. Then that life comes back to haunt her when she meets up with an old friend, and things become strained in her current family life, so she escapes from there for a while by withdrawing into a kind of fantasy. Her husband is patient and her kids don't even know what's going on.I thought most of the characters were pretty whiny. I liked Jo's mom, her husband Daniel, and her daughter Sadie. I can understand where the story is coming from, because I think everyone has wanted to just escape for a while (I know I have), but the realities of life set in and you realize you really can't escape.I thought that the book was well written, I just think I was expecting something different."
5,Highly recommended,"I found Sue Miller's writing in this book to be smooth and spellbinding. I enjoyed it from cover to cover and had a very hard time putting it down. I felt as though I was on the emotional rollercoaster along with the main character. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a deep, heartfelt read."
1,She should have stayed gone!,"This story has more holes than a daytime soap. A woman meets a man from the past and wants to have an affair with him. Then she finds out he killed her friend. That being the basic storyline, there were too many unanswered questions. Why did Jo care about Eli? Why did she want to cheat on Daniel? Why did she decide to lie about her name when she moved in with Dana and the rest? And last but not the least, why did Eli tell her the truth about Dana? The book was a fast read and was over before I got too bored with the defective storyline. I suggest if this book must be read, it must be checked out of the library, bought at a used bookstore, or borrowed from someone like me."
3,While I Was Gone/Sue Miller,"I thought this book was well-written but it seemed more like an overly long short story more than a novel. I did not believe in the husband's profession as a minister and her lack of involvement in the church. I also knew that Eli had killed Dana very early in the story and felt that his confession was also too pat. But, the author did make her characters very believable and I did want to turn the page to find out how things were resolved. The outcome of the police not believing her story and intimating that she was acting out of a spurned attraction was very true to life....actually the best part of the book. Sue Miller can really pull one into her characters and tell a good story."
2,whiney midlife drivel,"I am reviewer 1,800. Too bad, because I will have little chance to warn others: this is indulgent, whiney drivel. We get to know the passive thoughts of the protagonist, with thumbnails of the rest. I didn't care about the main character, or anyone else, not even the dogs! The reason I finished it was to give an opinion to the friend who lent it to me.Her friend is murdered. Wow! I considered warding off readers by blowing the skimpy mystery, but please heed my warning: you will, or at least ought to, be disappointed."
2,"""Girls book"" grown up","I hesitate to call this a book for women as I tend to believe women have come a long way from the customs of the 1960s; however, for some reason, this book reminded me of the ""books for girls"" on the library shelves of the 1960s. They were books I, as a girl growing up in that era, tried to avoid because I found them dull, boring, and uninteresting when compared to ""books for boys."" This book seems to fall in the same category -- a lot of psychological and motivational review with no action. For those that enjoyed reading ""books for girls,"" this book will be a good read; for those of us women with more ""liberated"" taste, this book is simply a grown up version of ""books for girls."""
1,Disappointed,"I am reading ""While I Was Gone"" for a book club and am having a difficult time trying to read to the end of the book. Frankly, the book is boring, the female character is a self-absorbed, one dimensional, selfish person that gets along better with animals than people. I was disappointed with the story line, actually I was disappointed with all aspects of this book, except of course that I didn't pay much for it, because I bought it on Amazon.com."
2,get to the point!,"I found this book to be very slow in getting to the point. The writing is good, but there's just way too much detail."
1,what was the point?,"The way I judge if a book was worth the time and effort I put into reading it, is how the book made me feel at the end, and what it taught me. This book did not teach me much. THe characters were there, but they weren't really there. I didn't get the personal relationship feeling that makes me care about the characters. When I finally finished the book, I had to ask, what was the point of that? This was the first book I read by Sue Miller, and it will probably be the last. I didn't understand why Eli would have suddenly decided to confess what he did. He went 30 years without anyone suspecting him, without anyone asked him about it. And he suddenly has the urge to get it off his chest...yeah right. Then there are Jo's daughters. They are all very different from each other, but very socialy stereotyped characters. And almost to offset Jo's behavior, the husband is a pastor. The characters barely fit together."
4,Yearning for the Past,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and whilst I didn't always sympathisze with Jo's struggle to let go of her past, I had no trouble forging ahead quickly with this well written novel. To me, a great deal of what Jo clings to is not what happened in her past but of what she feels she missed out on from her past. Her difficult relationship with her daughters stems from the opportunities they are seizing in their youth but which she did not seize upon, despite opportunity, when she was ""away"". I admit that the ending was not quite as dramatic as I anticipated it to be, but in retrospect, some of the potential endings I was envisioning would have probably been too melodramatic. Sue Miller instead takes Jo to a place in her life where she finally accepts and appreciates the life and family she has."
5,Impossible to put down,"A must read for the middle aged woman. I was able to relate to this book in more ways than one. Life in the sixties ... life as mother of an emotionally exhausting daughter, sibling rivalry, and all of those questions of who am I? Where would I be had I'd traveled that other road? Is this what life is all about ? This was one of those books I couldn't wait to get back to, but ... didn't want to finish."
4,"Jo Was Gone, Alright!","This was a really good book - except it was one of the few books I've read where I didn't like the main character. Jo has everything - a great husband, good sex, nice kids, beautiful home, great job. But she is selfish. When she was much younger, she ran away from her first husband and her mother and didn't tell them where she was - just that she was okay. Then, in her usual selfish way, she decides to have an affair with a man from her past who has really given her very little encouragement. I wanted to throttle her. But, yet the book really drew me - probably because I could completely relate to her ""hippie"" experiences. A book that stays with you long after you're done reading it."
1,Yawn !,"I have to agree with reviewer Steven Becker. This was a painfully slow & laborious book. I too was drawn in by the riveting reviews, but quickly realized I had been duped. Apologies to all Sue Miller fans...she is a good writer, but this was a very slow & tedious plot line.....a big yawn for me."
3,Good Plot--Bland Ending,"I was intrigued by the online reviews of this book so much that I decided to buy it. I thought the storyline was interesting enough--a woman's past seems to come back to haunt her--but just when the book started getting good, it seemed to fizzle. The ending was quite weak in spite of all Sue's wonderful writing that lead up to it."
3,A disappointing character ....,"While I was intrigued with Jo's character in the beginning, the more I read the more she disappointed me. She becomes obsessed with her desire to visit her past and to remember and in doing so she becomes a tedious character. I wanted to finish the book and yet I had no motivation to pick it up once I was half way through. I continued to read on wishing that the book would take a dramatic turn back to interesting but unfortunately rhe ending is disappointing as well."
4,Beautifully written,"This book revolves around a theme of forgiveness and has a little bit of surprises here and there... Very simple book, though... and some parts are rather mundane -- only problem with this book. The author paces the reader well, with very chronological arrangement of ideas, unlike some books... If you are in for thriller, this will not be your choice, but if you need some food for though, trust me -- this is it!"
2,"Read ""The Good Mother"" instead","I loved ""The Good Mother"".I didn't care about any of the characters and my response is a big SO WHAT. Not engaging for me at all."
3,Come On...,"This was definately an interesting novel. It was real which meant I could relate to a lot of the emotions being protrayed. It didn't have a quick and happy ending which i enjoyed. It's not always easy to get over someone contemplating the idea of infedelity and this book certainly did justice to that. I felt however that this book was a bit long at times. But overall it was a fun read. A taste of the real ""love"" life."
3,"Moving book, but no conclusion","In ""While I Was Gone"" Jo has what one would call a ""good life"" , a nice husband, beautiful home, 3 daughters, but often finds herself reflecting back to her college years. I liked the book, but was a little dissapointed with the lack of conclusion. To be exact, there wasn't much of a conclusion to the main problem Jo faces. She is an established vet in a small Massachusetts town when somebody from her past returns. She is then faced with a major decision that could change her marriage and her life altogether. The ending just didn't feel cohesive to me.What I didn't like about the book was how it flowed. I was interested to hear Jo talk about her life in college, but suddenly the chapter would end. It picks back up in present day talking about life with her husband and so on. Overall, I had sympathy for what the characters had gone through and I would recommended it with reservations."
3,I wouldn't recommend it.,"I've never read a book that didn't have some redeeming qualities, however this one leaves me wondering just what I walked away from it with.I didn't like the characters. The main character was self absorbed to the point of disgust. Her husband was a minister, a sad excuse for one. Hopefully he is not based on a real character.Just a waste of time. I've never read anything else by this author and I'll not be inclined to."
4,Great Oprah selection,"I have recently decided to read as many Oprah books as I can. This was my 3rd book. It is not a quick read, but it was an enjoyable book. It took me about 2 months to read, but it was well worth it!!! If you are skitish about the death of pets, I would steer clear of this book, though. There was a scene in the book that just left me in tears for days!"
3,"Good, not great","This was a good book- not my favorite, but kept my interest. The characters never seemed real to me nor did the their actions.Not a waste of my time, but a bit disappointing."
2,Me,"I picked up this book and it took me a very long time to finish, the story line just didn't catch my attention enough to want to keep reading it. It was really hard to relate to the main character and it was also hard to understand her reasoning for the things she did. It would have been a much better story if it only was about her past life."
1,One of my least favorite Oprah reads...,"I have been reading the Oprah choices, and this one was not up to par. The character development was completely lacking in all aspects. Near the end of the novel, I didn't care what happened to Jo...she became very selfish, critical and had no inner strength or spark. I felt the entire novel was intended to make the reader feel ""sorry"" for Jo, poor Jo. Not a favorite."
2,Wish I had gone....,"I read it- the whole thing- but I don't think I liked it. The story that was meant to draw you in with one woman's conflicting feelings about her past (and maybe her present), rang hollow. I can't tell you what was missing but something was. Trite? Same old plot new characters? I'm not sure. But it was a book that made no sense to me. The main character seemed to have the perfect man in her life. Thoughts about an affair? Why? And then to get righteous about something that possibly happened in the past,go to the police, and jeopardize that great life? Well- guess you'll just have to decide for yourself. There just wasn't enough MOTIVE for any of the actions the main character took. I read this before Oprah made it one of her books. When I saw that she endorsed it, I wondered why. I usually like her choices. Not this one."
3,While I Was Gone,While I Was Gone was a story that came up a little to short for my liking. It was a very slow read for of the book. The last of the book is what made me rate this book as a three instead of a zero. I wouldn't tell someone not to read it but I could think of many other books that I would recommend before While I Was Gone.
2,"Read this and wish you were reading it, While You were Gone","I have enjoyed Sue Miller in the past, but this book just didn't do it for me. While the premise got my interest, the plot is so thinly constructed and the characters so unexceptional, I plowed my way through the book thinking, ""I wish I, too, were gone.""Finally, the resolution is disappointing and one closes the book thinking, ""What a dissatisfying ending to a dissatisfying book."""
1,A real snoozer,"I kept waiting for this book to get more interesting, for something to happen. I was disapointed that nothing ever did. I felt it was a weak story that the author attempted to disguise with her overuse of descriptive language. There are much better Oprah books out there to read. This is the only one out of ten which I didn't like."
3,"While I was gone, I didn't look forward to finishing this bo","Just finished this book. The characters were wishy washy and not believable. It made light of a violent death. I was surprised it was on Opraha's list. The main character has no spine. She does weird things that hurt people. She lives her life in a dream world and only thinks of herself. This is a wimpy book. Easy to put down and not pick up again. I felt I didn't want to know this woman. The book was mildly entertaining. I would not recommend it to anyone. I'm with Daniel, He threw a tomato. It was rotten."
2,Wish I was gone,"I have never read this author before, so when Oprah suggested it on her show, I thought I'd give it a read. While it was not the WORST book I have ever read, I can't say I liked it much. The story was scattered with a lot of extra information that it didn't need. I was especially disappointed in the fact that the supposed topic, when is infidelity infidelity?, was almost an afterthought. I kept waiting for the story to go into that, when Oops, a murder. Seems like this author couldn't really decide on a storyline, so she picks several, with no depth to any of them. I don't think I will be reading her other books."
3,I Was a Fool to Go,"While I do enjoy Miller's ability to make her characters so real they may be living next door to the reader or even in their own household, I do get a little tired of their dissatisfaction with life and not knowing why they feel that way. I think anyone might identify with a moment or two of such thoughts but throwing away a valued relationship to pursue windmills as this woman did in her story makes us realize that perhaps many people do make mistakes in moments of trying to fullfill empty spots in their lives. It's a sad lesson to realize that the price for such pursuits is very high indeed. Although it might make home turf seem more dear when you return from the pursuits, not everything can be regained. Parts of your paradise, lost."
1,Disappointing and dull,"This is by far the weakest of Sue Miller's books. The main character was very boring and whoever ""reviews"" the book for the inside flap should be fired immediately. They gave away the whole ""shocking secret"" in the review. I didn't care about any of the characters and stopped reading the book after a point because it simply became uninteresting."
2,not what i was hoping for,"While reading this book, the only reason I continued was the feeling that it was just about to get interesting. I was truly disappointed because it never did. I felt like I flew 10 hours in an airplane, 50 feet off the ground and when I landed, realized I hadn't gone anywhere."
2,Hoped for more,"I had just completed my last final exam of an 11 year ""return to college"". Imagine my delight as I sat down & turned the TV to Oprah to see her introduce her latest book club selection! Finally a chance to read something without having to hold a highlighter in my right hand. But what a disappointment I was in for! I couldn't understand any of the characters. How could Jo & her husband be together when they seemed to value different things? I couldn't imagine a group of young people living together in the 1960's being more uptight than this group was. Dana sounded like an annoying, people pleaser, who never heard the word ""boundary"" before. Eli was pompous, shallow & weak. The ending of the story was frustrating & made me glad when the story was over. As someone who has missed reading for pleasure for many years, I hope this choice isn't indicative of Oprah's other Book Club selections."
4,Very deep,"This book, to me was very deep. It was also close to home for me and I felt sort of meloncholy while reading it because it made me realize the same mistakes I had made in my life. It was a very well written book."
3,While I Was Gone,"I loved the plot in this book, but found the narrative too slow. I did like the details given in the book about the people around the narrator. It made you think that these are real people doing real things."
2,fractured,"I thought this book had too much information that didn`t mean much and not enough explanation at one time to explain enough. It was too long for the storyit told. I didn`t really like any of the characters but if I had to pick one it would be Cass because she was believable. Jo seemed to lack substace and even at the end of the book I still didn`t know her husband.My favorite parts of the book are her get right to the heart of it descriptions of people and situations such as, Know this about me and yet LOVE ME----PLEASE or on page 154 where her grown children realize their mom had a past life that didn`t include them. Your children never think of you in any other way than mom or dad and especially mom. Other than those few really great descriptions I just thought this book lacked depth and so did it`s character."
4,While I was Gone,I listened to this book on tape and felt the reader was excellent and was able to take you through the emotions Jo was expressing and through the different trials that she was experiencing as a her past came to light!
3,"Gripping, unsettling, melancholy","My title says it all! I found the story to be very well written and interesting enough to read overnight. However, the main charater, Jo, continually makes bad decisions which come to unsettling, upsetting conclusions. I didn't feel good after reading this story -- I felt quite melancholy reading about this woman nearly destroying a good marriage and her good life. I could have lived without reading this book..."
2,I suppose I should have skipped this one,"This book is heavy with angst, I suppose. I suppose, I did not care for any of the characters. It was actually depressing, I suppose. All the characters sounded alike to me. How many times can one say, ""I suppose,"" in a novel. Well, I wished I had started counting from the beginning, because there must be over 100 ""I supposes."" It was so distracting!!! After a while it was about how many ""I supposes,"" I could find in one page. And all the characters spoke the same. And Daniel, please for being a minister he sure knows how to meet out punishment, for a crime that never even happened. Oh my God. If you have limited time, skip this book!"
3,Everyone May Not Like It - But I Certainly Did,"Friends of mine had trouble getting into this book; I thoroughly enjoyed it, although I could see where they got bored. If you like a sort of descriptive, sensual and lush writing - you'll enjoy this. If you like plot and action, you might want to pass - or at least plan to hold out until things really start happenning in the middle of the novel."
2,while i was gone,"Well written, but uninteresting.Sue Miller can write, she'sgood at developing characters, and also at writing dialogue. But I found this particular story is quite ordinary, even though it deals w/a particular horrific event. It's surprising that there couldn't have been more of a payoff after going through this journey.By the middle I was so bored, but was determined to finish this book, hoping that it would have some kind of exciting finish. Very disappointing.I doubt I'll pick up her future books."
3,"Decent, but not great.....","When I first started reading this book, it was interesting. The main character, Jo, was very real, and well developed. Her family was described as a typical family as well. They each had their own problems, etc. However, after the mini-climax in the middle of the book, it sort of goes downhill from there. There is pretty good material, but it's a little drawn out at times. If you're looking for a decent book to read, it wouldn't be a bad one to pick. If you're looking for a page turner.. I would probably go for a different one."
2,While I was Gone by Sue Miller,"While listening to this audiobook I often wished that I was gone from the vehicle. I found the plot line predictable and the characters were poorly developed. Why did this lady become a vet? At no point in her Cambridge days does she express a desire to help anyone or anything but herself. Why does she marry a minister? At no point does she explore her own faith. I found her very self-centered and unlikeable--someone who is watching life from the outside, always living in a dreamworld and never truly talking the risks that would allow her to grow. Pass this one up."
3,Why the Stereotypical Scientist?,"While Miller writes well in a mournful way, a feminine counterpart to Chris Bohjalian's mournful men, this comment is directed at her disparaging treatment of scientists. She presents Eli Mayhew as a cold, emotionally bereft misfit, as a person who does not measure up to the remainder of the characters (most of whom are artists, ministers, or blue-collar workers). Ultimately he is revealed to have committed a deranged act. Miller creates an image no better than that of the 1950-era movie mad scientist. She could have chosen a less anti-intellectual way to construct the participants in her story. Carl Witthoft (physicist, musician, athlete, and most of all father)"
2,I'm surprised Oprah liked it!,"The author writes in excruciating (but not interesting) detail. She writes about the main character's every move throughout the day... maybe it's part of the moral of the story, but I found it boring. It was also hard to sympathize with the main character. I could see where the writer was going in terms of the message she wanted to communicate, but I think the story was poorly told."
3,reviting it was not,"This book, in a word, was enjoyable. I wouldn't tell my best friend that she HAS to read this, I wouldn't tell her to stear clear either. It began okay and picked up when we flashed back to her days in Cambridge. When we were back though, it seemed to continue this build up but it did not have the bang that I felt we deserved. I liked the book, don't get me wrong but it didn't keep me up past my bed time like a good but should."
1,A waste of time,"This is a shallow, meaningless, empty book that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I got sucked in during the first chapters with her description of a 50ish woman living in Martha Stewart dreamland (successful career, loving husband, 3 beautiful daughters, gorgeous house, etc.). But the rest of the book exposes the rotten core at the center of this cocoon. Thousands of novels have been written with this same theme, and there is absolutely nothing new in this one. Don't waste your time!!!"
1,A chick-flick of a book,"First you get to marry a doctor, then you get bored and become a Bohemian, find some drawbacks there and so finally you get to marry somebody that understands and appreciates you. You get to take care of and understand animals as a veterinarian. But your life still seems to miss some spark and so a murder mystery is thrown into the mix. All of your friends are affiliated with Harvard, Berkeley, or some other high prestige place--no Illinois State or blue color workers for you. This was a truly awful book written for dreamy status-seekers with no empathy or understanding of the real world."
3,Good read but had slow points,"There were so many exciting and interesting things about this book. I enjoyed the telling of Jo and her housemates. Describing each one in such detail, their mannerisms and how they related to each other. The book had several places that just slowed down for me though. I had to stay at it to keep interested at some points along the way. The one thing I truly didn't like was that Daniel was a pastor and Jo really had no real belief system. That just doesn't work. It's not consisted with a conventional pastor and his wife and the role that each should play. Over all though I enjoyed the book, but at times was a laborous read."
1,My last Oprah book,"I've read this author before, For Love, and found the writing weak. Same thing for this book. The murder was the only exciting event in the story, but nothing happened with it. The characters are weak and unlikeable, even the animals were mediocre. Maybe if I was in the same boat as the leading character, married and unhappy (but she doesn't know it yet) I would understand the book. Most of Oprah's books have turned out to be all hype and no substance."
3,Good Book/Worth Reading,"Miller's book---the first that I've read of hers---is worth reading. While at times I felt the whole ""mystery"" of the book was a bit dramatic --Miller did a good job at conveying the main character's inner and outer conflicts. I felt like I understood her and at the same time I didn't really agree with her. The prose was finely wrought---though I felt like I was always coasting on Jo's surface never sinking down enough in her waters to feel contained by her--- I wanted to feel a sadness at the end--a kind of grief readers experience when the novel ends and a great character and a great book finishes its time with me. But all in all, you should read it. It's worth it."
5,Brilliant and intriguing epic,"This is one of the best books I've read this year. Jo is a woman who seems to have it all, yet feels bored and restless. I feel that many people will identify with her longing to relive her youthful days of adventure. The characters are vividly drawn, and interesting. This book examines a very frightening moral dilemna whose implications are startling. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
4,While I Was Gone,"Once you get into this book, you can't put it down or forget it when you've finished. As in Sue Miller's book, The Good Mother, the main character has difficult choices to make with her personal life, and I'm not sure she makes the right decision. It definitely makes you wonder what you would do in her shoes. There are also interesting contrasts between her professional and private life."
3,Well it was okay........but not great.,"I enjoyed the moral issues raised in this book. As Oprah asked, ""When is cheating, cheating?"" Sue Miller handled that issue in a compelling way...in fact, I believe she left it up to the reader to decide. My only fault is that the plot wasn't riveting. Even the ""shocker"" at the end seemed anti-climatic and contrived to cleanse Jo of her actions rather than truly deal with the crisis."
2,Not Miller's best work,"Try Sue Miller's other books, or readRabid: A Novelby T.K. Kenyon or Bee Season: A Novel by Myla Goldberg.I'm too young and too foreign to bring much to this book, but you shouldn't have to bring a similar history to enjoy and understand a book. I don't think I ever will understand why Americans in the 60's and 70's were so obsessed with very misrepresented Indian culture. The details seemed disjointed, and the culture of ""free love"" and bohemian living is so different from the type of world that I grew up in.Beyond the setting and premise, the main character Jo Becker seems like a whiner who is always longing for something better than she's got. The ending was unsatisfying and unsettling, but not in a good way. My book club fantasized about more satisfying endings instead of discussing the book itself.Sorry.Minna"
1,One of the most boring books I have ever read in any category.,"I picked this up because of great reviews & its inclusion on Oprah's book list. I found it to be extremely boring and tedious. Seriously, three pages on the morning routine of feeding the dogs? And this is not beautiful Proust-like detail, or points that move the plot along - it's just listing of steps. I didn't find the emotion and realness that other reviewers found - I mainly found an unlikeable narrator and an overall premise so conservative (really? you go live in a communal house in the 60s but you don't have any sex or do any drugs?) that I don't see the point of investing time reading it. This book takes no risks. It might have been great as a novella."
4,While I Was Gone,"This was my first Sue Miller book, but it will not be my last!I read ""While I Was Gone"" in a few days...Sue Miller has a gift as a writer to bring the reader inside the pages,the world, and situations she is writing about. I liked the main charactor, Jo....her honesty towards her husband, and I found out things about myself that I hadn't reflected on before. Ofcourse, Jo's husband was too good to be true, an angel really, to put up with her infacuations. One of my favorite parts is when Jo tells her husband about her ""so called almost affair"" and she knows he sees her walking out to her car, but he stands hidden in the garage. I think everyone should read this book, dive into the pages and swim directly into the lives of these characters ......You may just find something out about yourselves!"
5,Fantastic yet real,"I absolutely loved this novel. The fact that Jo was such astrong woman, who had accomplished so much, was key. But the best part for me was some of Sue's writing, in which she/Jo expressed feelings I've had but have not been able to put into words. They were REAL feelings/fears/revelations, even in the context of this fictional work. It really blew me away. I've tried other Sue Miller books and not been as connected; this one really hit home for me."
3,Mixed at Best,"I found much of this book compelling and was eager to keep reading. There is much here to enjoy. Ultimately, however, I found the book disappointing. I saw where the book was going long before it got there. I found the main character (and narrator) frustrating in her lack of insight and her poor judgment. Unlike ""The Good Mother"" where it was easy to see how the main character got into the predicament she ended up in, Jo's predicament seemed very avoidable.While I was reading this book, a woman came up to me and asked me how I liked it. It seems that a friend of hers was finding it difficult to get into. That wasn't exactly my reaction, although very early on it's hard to figure out where the book is going.All in all, I'd say the book is worth reading."
2,Hard to get into the story,"I too am ambivalent about this book. At times it was interesting but the author added way too many extraneous details which end up making the story a patchwork quilt. I think that the author could have and SHOULD have spent more time developing the characters with whom Jo (the main character) comes in contact with. I'm a Gen X-er so maybe I can't understand middle aged angst, but this adult woman appears to be more self-centered than a teenager. I will say that Miller does a good job at creating a character that one can neither hate nor love -- but the character is also not one who can consistently hold the reader's interest. Be prepared to read a good chapter, then a random chapter, then a good chapter, then a random chapter..."
2,Downhill?,"I've been a bit disappointed in Sue Miller's last two novels but I am somehow compelled to keep reading her releases. This book simply left me flat. I was not at all affected by the characters nor was I surprised by the unfolding of the plot. I found Eli's character pretty despicable and felt that daughter Cassie was well drawn. Otherwise, I was unimpressed by the author's motivation."
2,Boring,"WHILE I WAS GONE made me want to get up and leave myself. I put it aside a third of the way through and started THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, the other book I ordered along with it, and greatly enjoyed that one, it is a thriller of the highest quality!"
3,Opens with promise...Drops off at end,"At first, this book was greatly interesting. However, as it went on, the plot became realtively predictable. Although it is predictable at times, it is also an enjoyable read. I recommend borrowing it from the library rather than buying it. Or, wait for it in paperback..."
2,"Promising begining, disappointing ending","I immediately got into the begining with the flashback to Cambridge, but the 2nd half where she contemplates her affair with Eli is weak. I felt she was on a mission to ruin her life. I didn't identify with the character or feel any sympathy for her. She made all of her own decisions!"
3,Eventually Interesting,"I found this book difficult to read. It took me several tries to get far enough into it that I was motivated to keep going (I hate to leave a book unfinished). Once the story developed and her past life started to emerge I was hooked and found finishing the book a breeze. My advice: push on, it will get interesting eventually."
3,Didn't live up to my expectations,"I fell in love with Sue Miller's writing when I read ""The Distinguished Guest,"" which is a fabulous, gripping novel. So I know Miller is an excellent writer. That said, this book was uneven, at best. Some of the passages were breathtaking. There were times when I couldn't put the book down. I was really interested in the relationship between Dana and Jo, yet it needed more development. I found Jo's relationships with her kids, husband, and coworkers had potential, but could've been fleshed out more. The fascination with Eli didn't fit, though what happened between them was simplistic and predictable. Check it out of the library if you really want to read it."
4,Anxious to start reading again,I have not read my book as yet but I'm sure I will like it. I will give Amazon 4 stars because they are always so quick in sending what I order. I love to read and sure this book will be good but just have not had time to read it. Hopefully will get it done real soon.
2,"I really wanted to like this book, but . . .","Some of the writing is beautifully evocative: of time and place, of the details of the settings -- even the weather when incidents take place. But the characters, every single one of them, are really just character types, caricatures; they never seemed like real people, and consequently it was impossible to care very much about what happens to them. Rather than a hard-to-put-down read, it was a hard-to-pick-up one."
1,"Finds Christ, leaves New Age behind.",This is a piece of devotional literature by a recent convert telling us in what sounds like a transparent and shallow way how horrible it was to be a New Age person. Now she hears the voice of God instead of the voice of the devil and her cocaine addiction is presumably gone
1,Author's deceit or channel's deceit,"For whatever reason, it is really hard to believe this book. It sounds like a pot boiler cooked up to satisfy a fundementalist audience who would believe any imaginable negative story about New Age people. Not deserving of attention from people with a loving and forgiving Christian heart."
3,The death of a German super battleship in Norway.,"An average read about the life and death of the Tirpitz, the sister ship of the Bismarck. The author was on one of the British ships protecting convoys to North Russia, and the Tirpitz posed a risk to these convoys. He also produced a BBC show on the same ship.This book is a picture book of this super battleship. She posed a risk and tied down many British ships of the line. As a result, the British tried a number of times to sink her by submarine and aircraft. These many attempts at first damaged the ship and then sank her. The British story about the pursuit and sinkings of this ship is almost as dramatic as that of the sinking of the Bismarck.Kennedy's writing is OK. The pictures are great. The ULTRA translations are adequate in the telling of this story. It seems ULTRA played a big part in how the British accessed the threat from this super battleship. This is a great story, but an average read."
3,"Acceptable, but not spectacular.","A lot of good information presented in a somewhat disorganized manner. A reader that is unfamiliar with Windows/Microsoft terminology will need at least one other book to look up terms in. The first edition (which seems to be an entirely different book) was much more to my liking (though much less useful at this late date).My biggest knock on the book is the irridescent marketing gas billowing through it, e.g., ""These four primary memory protection mechanisms are part of the reason that Windows NT has the reputation of being a robust, reliable operating system that is impervious and resilient to application errors."" This kind of evangelism is distracting and reduces the credibility of the rest of the book."
2,"another semi-competent work, skillfully veiled","I bought this self-styled ""internals bible"" to find a consistent, coherent description of the Windows NT security mechanisms. Upon turning to the security chapter, I was immediately confronted by the comment that, for some reason or other, the author would pay less attention to security than to other issues. Translation: ""I, your author, have no idea what I'm talking about, so I'm going to gloss over all the difficult questions and tell you, the reader, that you're ignorant if you ask them."" My quest for a cohesive Windows text written by a knowledgeable professional continues."
5,Best product for any vehicle,"I have numerous sets of these for all types of vehicles. It keeps your vehicle looking nice, and you will get the investment back when you go to sell your vehicle. A must have for people with kids!!"
2,Didnt fit the model number,"Quality was fine, but the liner did not fit the back of the car. I put the correct model number on order."
5,Beyond the Safe Zone - A Robert Silverberg Omnibus,"I buy every Robert Silverberg title I don't already own, and this one had a sort of surprise for me: I already had each and every story that is printed in this book. How come? This is an omnibus of the following excellent collections: ""Unfamiliar Territory"", ""Capricorn Games"" and ""The Feast of St. Dionysus"". My reason for keeping this copy are the interlaced story introductions by Robert Silverberg, telling the story behind the stories. If you don't already own these three titles, buy this one imediately. It was published in Britain as volume 3 of ""The collected stories of Robert Silverberg"" and there are as now at least 6 volumes published, who together provide a treasurebox of the best what Science Fiction stories can offer, especially when it goes together with the insights and retrospects of Mr. Silverberg himself."
4,"""It's like, cool n' stuff"".","I don't know why this is so dirt cheap, it's twice as good as their movie soundtrack. It's pretty much the mix of bands you would expect. The better tracks are from ""Nirvana"", ""Megadeth"", ""Aerosmith"", ""Primus"" and the ""Red Hot Chili Peppers"" covering a ""Stooges"" song. But the best track is Butt-heads ""Come To Butt-head"". It's him talking over a slow 70's groove, and is really funny. There's also B & B chit-chat between most songs, some of it goes on forever, but most is humerous. At this price it's worth getting. It'll go great with your ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" and ""Wayne's World"" soundtracks."
4,This CD is really worth the money!!!,"I really liked this CD mostly because I love Beavis and Butthead but also because it has lots of funny moments. It's almost like watching part of an episode for every song. My two favorite songs are ""Come to Butthead"" [a song that is based on Buthhead's saying (this song is very funny)], and ""I got you babe"" where Beavis and Butthead sing the famous song along with Cher. Butthead sings and when I first listened to the CD, my jaw hurt from laughing so much. I hope evrybody who likes Beavis and Butthead even just a little bit, to get this CD. It is great!!!!!!! END"
1,Just goes to show what you listen to as you're younger,"I was open to everything, and anything musical, so yes I even played this all the way through. I also watched a few of the cartoons in the show. I don't want to go back there again. I feel only one song was salvagable from this pile of junk, and that was the Red Hot Chili Peppers version of ""Search & Destroy."" They didn't try, and make it sound funky, but went with a full frontal sonic assult that would've made Iggy proud. However, the rest is horrific....especially on Aerosmith's ""Deuces Are Wild"". This is also from my horrible first few months in Florida. Which goes to show that either I was changing musically again, or Florida stations suck. This album does too."
1,la la la,"Yeah, back in the early 90s when B&B were the big thing MTV put together this really bad comp.These are throwaway and leftover songs from not really great bands and the Cher song is incredibley dumb.No one even remembers this, this is probably below tons of garbage under the driver seat of some guy who has a Korn cd or whatever commmercial MTV music is ""IN"" now.There is one mistake that was never corrected. Anthrax does not have a song on here. Looking Down The Barrel of A Gun is a Beastie Boys song, Anthrax is just on the semi-funny B&B tour bus story."
1,A waste of time,"Slater is a neurotic whiny snob, and her experience of motherhood is far from the average. This book is an exercise in self-importance. She doesn't have an interesting answer to her title either: ""I know things I didn't know before. I love like I did not love before, but how, or when, this happened, is really a mistery, steps of smoke."""
4,battery,This battery should work well for anyone. but for some reasonit didn't fit right into my archos 504.
1,A little respect for Rex Stout,"In published interviews Rex Stout said that authors who wrote using other writers' characters were no better than cannibals and should roll their own. Unfortunately his family, blinded no doubt by the possibilities of royalties ad infinitum unearned by any of their own labors, disagreed. The results are these pale imitations. Where Stout's Nero Wolfe is eminently re-readable, Gainborough's are barely worth reading the first time."
5,Kills false memory myths; extremely practical; WILL help!,"Dr Higbee reviewed literally hundreds of papers, books, etc, on memory. Here he distills what's fact & fiction. He teaches methods that really work. But, they do take some practice. The easiest ones can be picked up in minutes. Others take prep time & practice of an hour or more, but will help from then on. For instance, want to know how to remember long strings of numbers? It's here, it's easy (once you learn the technique) and it's probably not what you think."
2,I thoughts the book presented an unrealistic view of memory,I thoughts the book presented an unrealistic view of memory. I noticed that the book has been out for a couple of decades and thought it might be a good source to improve my memory. I'm not sure that it has been updated since its creation. I decided to go back to school and wanted some assistance in my classes and help in studying. I diodn't find it to be practical in the long run. I feel guiltly about not giving it the ratings of the other reviewers but I must be reasistic.
2,Hard to get into,"Whatever brilliant points this book tries to make, it doesn't get them across very well, so they're wasted. Needs to be written in a more approachable (and therefore, useful) way."
2,Not Very Impressed,"I've spent most of my life memorizing facts, names, numbers and other important information. When I purchased this book I was hoping I would find something that would give me a much-improved ability to remember with less effort. Sadly, I am not very impressed with what I have found. After giving a thorough explanation of how the human memory works, the author then launches into several chapters on mnemonics. Perhaps the most helpful chapter of the whole book was the one on remembering names and faces.Reading the reviews caused me to expect much more than what the author delivered. If you are seeking a quick, easy-to-master means of sharpening your memory, look elsewhere. This book isn't really worth the time required to read."
4,Oddly avoids quantifying results,"The techniques described in this book have worked for me.But the author rarely quantifies the results from the 150+ studies he quotes. About 80% of the time, he will say something like ""In several studies, people trained in the Loci method remembered more than people that had not been trained."" But by how much? Twice as much? 10x as much? It would be easier to prioritize which method to use (Loci method, Major System, Link Method, etc.) and to be more confident in the methods if the author quantified the improvements people made in learning by using those methods. He quotes over 150 studies, many from academic journals, which should contain quantified results. Why leave them out? It leaves me doubting the success of these methods if so many studies have been done but their results are rarely quantified.Despite that, some results are quantified, and the book does contain techniques are easy to learn and effective for me."
3,Super Reader,"Novelisation of the 1966 movie.""Batman to Robin,"" he yelled. ""Superemergency! Send down the shark repellent Batspray!""You get the idea."
2,Kind of a Drag,"Why would a recording made in 1975 not include their biggest hit - Kind of a Drag? Without that, this is an incomplete collection, at best."
4,Eye savers,"First, These glasses are no more fragile than any other pair of clip-on glasses. If used properly and handled properly, they will last just fine.They do reduce eyestain and make reading online more comfortable. They work for super white book/magazine pages, too.They are large enough to cover larger lenses but, work fine on smaller lenses (reading glass size).The price is low enough to be affordable and cheaper than prescription or some other types/brands offered for the same purpose.I bought mine so I wouldn't need three pairs of prescription glasses and recommended them to a friend. I like them."
3,Works ok,"The product works to reduce the glare from my computer screen, but unfortunately the lenses were scratched within the week. I only used them while at the desk, it was the clips that put scratches on the lenses."
2,Work great but break easy,"UPDATE: Although I like how these lenses work, I will not buy another pair because this is the second pair that has broken (or just came apart where the lens connect to the frame) within a short period of time.I use my 32 LG LCD 1028 TV (purchased @ Amazon at a really good price) a LOT, both just for TV and also as my computer monitor. I really needed an anti-glare eyeglass shield. These work great! I have absolutely no eyestrain and the color and definition are only just slightly reduced; actually, both are almost not any noticeable.A well worthwhile purchase."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"This was the worst VCR I have ever owned! It worked great when I bought it 3 months ago and since then it has chewed up 3 tapes and the only thing that works now is the eject. It is completely useless and cannot be repaired. I was not expecting it to last for years but expected to get more than 3 months out of it. I was generous in giving this product 1 star...it doesn't even deserve half a star. I could understand if the thing were used constantly but on the average it was used maybe once a week, so that would make it a total of about a dozen times we used the VCR. I woud advise anyone to save their money and buy a different one!"
3,Toshiba W714 Very Sensitive to TRACKING info on Tape,"Purchased this unit in Nov 2001. The picture is above average to great, depending on the tape (even on purchased tapes) and the flying amp does make the stills and slow motion a whole lot better.There is one problem that I have noticed that also affect others who use the linear timing track on the tape. The quality control on some purchased tapes is so poor that this tracking track is too weak for the player to hold track and the picture cuts out very often. An example is the tape with Tommy Lee Jones called U.S.Marshals. It will play on some VCRs but not this unit. Although, other tapes play fine in this machine.I have noticed that when this tracking problem occurs, playing the tape in Fast Forward does allow you to see the movie (no sound) but the picture is OK.So I guess you need two VCRs to keep the bases covered.Overall, it is a good machine."
5,Great product. It really works.,My wife and I have been using it for years. We are very sensitive to milk products and we've found that this works much better than simple lactaid. If you have similar problems I'd advise at least trying it.
1,Don't bother,"I had similar results with my ET200 brad nailer. First one smoked, exchanged for a new one. Several months and 20-30 brads more and again it smokes. On disassembly, I discovered two brads jammed in the thing. This stopped the solenoid from completing it's cycle. Unless it completes and a lever hits a microswitch, the circuit continues to power the solenoid coil.A resistor, R1, on the circuit board is used as a current limiter and a fuse. This resistor over heats and burns itself and the moisture-proof board coating. The solenoid and the rest of the board is fine.There is a place for a fuse on the board, but a circuit board trace makes it inoperative, if it was there.It is repairable, but with the jamming being fairly common, it's just not worth the bother. I will find an air driven brad nailer."
2,Its probably worth US$ 25,"Its probably worth the US$ 25 advertised if you are building an aluminium boat, but 'In the Kingdom of the Blind, the Man with One Eye Is King'. It is missing a lot of practical information on welding, distortion, welding schedule etc... its rather general, however, reading it and reading another two or three books available on the subject, you can make a concise picture at the end."
2,Beginer baot builder,This book is not for the beginer. If you have experice with all the stuff that gos in on a boat desin then you can understand this book better. I got lost in what it was trying to tell you. which makes it hard to learn anything. It probable is not a bad book if you understand it. and i base that from the welding portion of the book that i understood and had no problem with.
3,Smaller than I thought,"I bought this for my sister, not really my taste, and she loved it. The lamp doesn't put off much light at all... but it was more for a show piece for her living room. It was ALOT smaller than I thought it would be."
5,Another rave,"Anybody's who is at all interested in Jewish culture will learn a lot from this book -- and enjoy it too. It's got a great section on Jews on broadway, an hysterical piece by Woody Allen, another highly readable set of Jewish jokes -- one can find historical information, interesting stuff on the immigrant's experiece, poetry, old and new, short stories as well as the standards like Roth and Bellow...You can pull this book down and start anywhere -- all the pieces are short so you don't get overwhelmed -- and feel instantly the richness and depth of the Jewish-American tradition."
2,The advantages & disadvantages of the Complete Trinity,"I have heard all the songs of this game, but I was only able to because I have played and beat the game before. The Compete Trinity verison of Sonic Heroes have pretty much everything on the real game and as a added bouns you can get to listen to 3 exclusive extras in the game, However the major flaw about this CD is, of course, the price.You may have 19 extra tracks on this CD than the Orginal, but the price is to some people is way to high. (in fact the cost is the almost the same as the videogame)This CD is good for anyone who is not interested in the game, but just listen to the music and listening to the extras on this CD."
5,Very cute story with expressive illustrations. Heartwarming,"This was a family favorite of several of my children and unfortunately now that our copy is shredded, it's also out of print. The Very Best Christmas Present is about a cranky old man who doesn't realize how attached he has become to a stray cat until it stops coming around. Keep this book in a convenient location, it will be read often."
3,"Uneven, But In The End, a Worthwhile Read","A good book, but terribly uneven, due probably to the fact that a lot of it was vetted in advance by the CIA. But what was left was, for the most part, interesting, if not fascinating. Some parts are compelling -- especially the detailing of his near-fatal air accident in the Congo. On the other hand, Holm tends to ramble -- some of the pages seem like those Christmas letters you get from friends, detailing the activities of each and every family member. Other parts -- especially those that hint of James Bond activities (which, let's admit it, are the main reasons we read books about the CIA) are often so short on detail or drama that they leave the reader puzzled. But on the whole, it's a very interesting look inside the walls and culture of the CIA, or, at least, the CIA of a recent past."
3,"Good, but VERY Detailed","Holmes is a very detailed man. He tells his lifestory in great detail. Some of it is interesting, some of it is not. He does an excellent job in describing the agency and how it operates. Unfortunately, you have to read or go through a lot of junk to get there.If you want the ""quick and dirty"" info about the CIA and how it operates, do not get this book. If you want great details about our operations in the Congo, Laos, and Asia and you have plenty of time, this is the book to read."
3,"Good information, though very glossy","A great account of the early years of the CIA, including the involvement in Laos, the ""Near East,"" and the creation of the Counter Terrorism Center. However, Holms only describes one side of the agency, and his personal opinions aren't always reflected in works by other former operations officers. Still, an interesting and very informative autobiography of the life of a CIA employee."
5,An Intimate Look at Life in the CIA,"In the interest of full disclosure, let me note that I am mentioned in ""The American Agent.""Dick's book is a very personal story not initially intended for publication but for the family. At the end of the day, the culture had changed. Even Dick Helms, traditionally opposed to CIA memoirs, was writing his ""Life in the CIA"" on the rational that someone was going to tell these stories and it might better come from those who lived them. The book is a valuable contribution to the literature, especially for anyone considering a career in the CIA.Andre Le Gallo[...]"
2,Not so great...,"I love everything CIA. But his book gets off to a super slow start. 120 pages in and all the character has been in the hospital the whole time doing rehab. I realize this is a true story, but it is kinda boring at first.I may try to finish it... I am not sure."
3,Really small,"I'm sure this is a fine product, but the description does not specify the size of the spatula -- it's only about three inches. I returned it, and because ""poor product description"" was not an available option as a reason to return, I had to pay the shipping costs. Unless you're specifically looking for a tiny spatula, this is not for you."
4,A good solid Naval Aviator read.,"The last review was written a dozen years ago. I ran across this title while researching Wally Schirra and was surprised to find that it was his first autobiography. Having bought it for the section (its in thirds) by Wally Schirra I found myself very happily reading the sections by Zeke Cormier and Phil Wood. WWII, Korea, and Vietnam combat off carriers, Blue Angels, test pilot duty, and space flight - this book Has it all. If you can find a copy and are a naval aviation buff you'll enjoy it a great deal."
5,SHolmes Fan,"Well written, directed and brillantly acted. An excellent first entry for the series. You won't be disappointed unless you are a 'purist.' Very entertaining."
4,Enjoyable,"It certainly was fun to watch. I do enjoy the black/white old movies. Rathbone was good, but I have to say, Jeremy Brett is the best ""Sherlock Holmes"". The DVD was flawless."
1,lousy service,"Corinex does not stand behind their products. They wouldn't know what ""customer service"" was if it dropped on their collective heads with a sign and a list of instructions.The product works, but after 11 months mine failed. I returned it to Corinex at my expense (of course). They recognized the units were under warrantee, but denied the problem and are returning the units to me unrepaired and at my expense (again).Do not buy from this company. Netgear makes a similar product."
5,Charles Xavier sheds the Jean-Luc Picard look.,"If you like the X-Men, you must get this figure.A few years back, They put a couple professor X figures out in concert with the blockbuster X-men movies. Those were very limited in their articulation, and they looked like Patrick Stewart! This new Marvel Legends Professor Xavier is in the same old wheelchair yet, the figure has been redesigned and is much more articulate this time around! Plus, the old figure's legs were very loose and useless for posing. I understand the character is paraplegic, but in the comics he experienced periods of full-mobility (not to mention when he was in the astral plane he could walk and run etc...). Well, this new figure has the use of his legs so you can stand him up and, if necessary, have him throw down a couple roundhouse kicks to magneto and his boys!Overall, a most excellent figure indeed!"
3,a well-made thriller,"The story talks about the relationships and betrayal games being played between three characters living in a house. The owners are a loving couple, fighting hard to go on with their happy married life. In order to meet their growing financial needs they decide to rent a portion of their house to a young part time singer, who in return brings more complications into their half broken marriage. The director slowly shows the ugly side of each central character in the script and also surprises the viewer with some sharp twists and turns in the plot. But still the movie fails to take you in completely and keeps on moving with a simple time-pass feel throughout.The first half seems to be inspired from ""A Perfect Murder"" where also the husband and his wife have a criminal link up with an artist.THREE - LOVE, LIES, BETRAYAL is a well-made thriller.In all it's just an okay product, which can be given a try if you really love this particular genre."
5,Small but Big in support,"Very portable and stable as a rock! It has a small footprint, takes up very little room. When you set your guitar down there's no worry with the hercules.I highly recommend it."
3,Just OK for me,"I love Hercules products. They get three stars just for being as solid and well-constructed as you expect from them. But I didn't really like the way my guitar rested in this. The bottom rungs seem to be angled back but the post is more straight-up, and the instrument seemed awkward in the stand. I bought it for an OM guitar, and it just didn't feel right. I also tried my Ovation shallow bowl with the same result. I did not send it back, though, because it turns out that it holds my mandolin just fine. It is a f-style mando, with a tone guard on the back. The stand seems a perfect fit for that.I can't rate it higher with a clean conscience, though, since it is billed as a guitar stand but is just OK at that function."
1,Not even a good paper weight!,This thing couldn't detect a stud if you showed it a picture of a 2x4 beforehand. I've had this thing for almost two years and have never had it reliably detect a stud. I can't believe Stanley would put such a piece of junk on the market. I'm through with their products. Don't waste your money. Look for another manufacturer.
1,Thought Stanley made good tools,"This one couldn't CONSISTANTLY find a stud in an open wall.When it does identify a wood stud and you go past it and then come back over it, most of the time it DOESN""T find it the 2nd time.For metal studs all it does is beep (on it) the ENTIRE time.If it weren't for the laser, I'd have chucked it years ago."
2,Don't buy for elderly parents,"This VCR is ok for technically-savvy people used to joysticks, but is an absolute nightmare for older or fat-fingered people."
2,PLEASE DON'T make this mistake,"Dissolusioned and surprisingly dissapointed with a product from what I thought is the name brand I could trust. The only reason I'm putting 2 stars instead of 1 is good picture quality and rewind speed, no denying that. But the other reviews are beyond me - I'm about to get rid of this stupid thing and get a better one.My #1 complaint: USER INTERFACE SSSSSSSUCKS!!!! I can't emphasise that enough - Toshiba designers scored a guinnes record on the unfriendliness of use here. I'm a product designer, and I think the interface, i.e. ability to program this thing to simply record things, is a design crime. I so hope that they (toshiba) actually check out user reviews, may be they'll get a clue."
1,why this book isn't worth the money,"The pretty girl on the cover intices you. the title may intice you. herge is a good photographer and you might know his other works and that entices you. so you want to buy the book. but don't.most of the shots are really mediocre. sorry herge. I loved the book Luba, but this one is far from it. some of the shots don't even have red eye reduction or removal. the poses aren't very creative. as pretty as the girl is a lot of the shots just make her seem terribly ordinary. I was bored to death with this book.I was done with it in less than 2 minutes. and when i picked it up again to make sure i didn't miss anything or was in a bad mood or something, it took even less time the second time around.if you really feel you need this book, take mine. perfect condition, held for less than 5 minutes. you are sure to be disappointed..."
3,Good idea....keeps my child busy,"The only problem I had this item was the instant I took it out of its plastic wrap and opened it up, the chalkboard fell out of its hinges on the top. A little bit of extra strength super glue fixed it and am hoping the dry erase side doesn't fall out later. Otherwise my 2.5yr old loves writing with the chalk and putting magnetic letters on the other side. Great investment - even if I have chalk dust all over my floor."
2,Great Idea--Poor Execution,"This table-top easel would be a great and useful ""toy"" if it were made well. We homeschool and have had this easel for a couple of years. It almost immediately fell apart. We have re-glued and re-stapled it several times. All Melissa and Doug painted-wood items we have purchased have not held together. This is because all the individual parts are painted before gluing, and the joints don't hold. As I stare at the pieces of this easel, which has fallen apart YET AGAIN, I would suggest that you search for a better table-top easel."
2,Low Quality,"I bought this toy yesterday thinking that Melissa and Doug was a good quality brand, but sadly I was let down. When I was putting it together I discovered that the wooden screws provided were too long for the holes they are supposed to fit into. This is something I can get over because it was just a cosmetic issue, it still held together just fine. Then, I let the kids start playing with it, and while they were enjoying the chalk board I notice that the white board side looked like there was a gritty film on it, so I made a small squiggle to see how well it would erase, and it barely erased at all! I got a damp cloth to see if it would wipe off and it didn't. I'll be returning this today, especially since it was so expensive! Terrible quality."
2,Poor quality,This toy had potential to be a great toy but I had to exchange it once and returned it in the end because it was such poor quality. The white board was warped on one and the chalk tray was cracked on the other one. Disappointed in the quality.
2,"Kids love it, but not a well-made product","I got this for my niece and nephew and they love the magnets and drawing on it, but it was clearly cheaply made and not in good condition. The wood on the frame was chipped before I even opened it. The dry erase board was warped and the marker that came with it was dried up."
3,Not bad for the price,"I wanted an inexpensive underwater camera for our Caribbean trip...I must say I was pleasantly surprised that this camera never leaked. The pictures we took didn't come out too bad, but they weren't great. I'm not sure if a flash would've been necessary, or possibly a zoom? The fish and coral pictures weren't great, but the sea turtles came out pretty good. Love the wrist strap...everyone else was struggling to snorkel while holding their cameras by the strap. Strap this to your wrist and you don't have to worry about it, just flip it up to take a picture...also helps to steady the camera. If you don't want to spend a lot of money for something you may only use a couple of times, give this camera a shot!"
2,Worked Great Until It Broke,"I bought the camera to take pictures in my pool of swimming students. At the end of each session of swimming we give them a picture of themselves swimming in the pool under the water and they love it. The camera took great pictures for 5 roles of film. On the sixth one, the part of the waterproof casing used to advance the film broke, so the only way to take pictures now is to take the camera out of the case, advance the film, put it back in the case, take one picture, and repeat the process."
4,Great for the price!,"For a cheap camera this is great. It's never leaked, easy to use, and fun! Take it anywhere you wouldn't take a ""real"" camera! I haven't taken that many underwater pictures, but it's great to use on canoe trips or inner-tube floats. Just strap it to your wrist and don't worry about it! Picture quality is not bad. Check out my dog swimming in the customer images."
2,Dangerous on tile,"This is a great product for removing dirt but VERY dangerous on tile. My front porch is tile and the mat slides around on it. The mat can go sliding when you step on to it. So, if you have a surface that is smooth, think carefully about this.Dangerous. I moved it to a rougher surfaced back patio and it is fine...."
2,It Could Be Better,"The doormat does what it is designed for but do not try to knock out the snow in -0 temperatures, as it will break apart."
2,The Brain That Wouldn't Die (VHS),"This is an edited version of ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die.""I strongly recommend the Full version, especially if you area Horror/Suspense Movie fan. Although this movie is considered ""campy"",the scenes edited from this version are ""gorely"" missed.I do not recommend this version because it is not the way it wasmeant to be seen. The Full version is a much better bargain for your money."
3,St. Clair Vision release not 92 minutes,The St. Clair Vision Collectors Edition release claims to be 92 minutes but only runs 82 and is a fairly crappy print. My quest for the elusive 92 minute version continues.
4,Sex n' Shivers!,"This movie is just too much fun and Im surprised hasn't been resurrected by the Right Wing Agenda for their anti-stem cell propaganda!But if you loved those cheap, cheesy weekend matinees movies when you were a kid, you will remember this one as fondly as I do...and thrill again to the genuine spookiness of the story and characters, while marvelling at the awful, camp aspect of Z level filmmaking!Virginia Leith is a Faye Dunaway look and soundalike and definitely acts rings around her more mobile costars.For a fun, nostalgic 82 minutes of well preserved...er, um...preservation, this is one you must have! If nothing else, you can play it on Halloween while you answer the door for trick or treaters!"
4,Loves Means Never Having To Say Goodbye,"3 stars for movie, 4 1/2 stars for cult appeal: A classic in the mad scientist genre, this film has a lot going for it. A rogue surgeon is doing unauthorized, but cutting-edge, work in the field of transplantation. His medical superiority is unrivaled and Jason Evers haughty performance is just the right mix of bluster and bravado. When a tragic accident harms his fiancee, he reaches into car wreckage and retrieves her head in a delightfully preposterous moment. It's back to the lair for some silly special effects and some moralizing--but then it's off to find a new body (preferably from some back alley lowlife). Things don't go as planned resulting in one of the longest and most ridiculous death scenes in cinema history and a mutation that just needs love. Delightful stuff. KGHarris, 8/11."
3,public domain,"As a young child, i seen this movie and it one movie that is unforgettable. The reviews for this movie are genrally positive and I agree, this is one of the great low budget sci-fi movies of the era (50s and early 60s). My comment is strictly to state that the quality of the print used by this company (appears to be specializing in so-called public domain movies) is generally good, with only a couple of minor glitches. I know many of you have been ripped off by similar companies (maybe even this one) and I too have been a victim. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
4,The obvious hasn't been stated!,"Having just viewed the MST3K version after years of ""neglect"", I'm shocked that no one has mentioned that this prefigures Herschell Gordon Lewis! For that alone, this deserves 4 stars!"
4,Not as much about Berlioz as about the drive to create,"Like many of Tony Palmer's films this one is very thematic, in this case the drive to create, some origins of that drive and the clash between creativity and public acceptance. As a biography of Berlioz this film is lacking, but as an exploration of the creative inpulse it provides ideas, but no answers. The film has excerpts from a Tony Palmer production of The Trojans; I wish that version were available on DVD. For me the film worked at many levels -- I thought is was beautifully filmed, nicely edited and that it moved smoothly between film excerpts, on location shots and commentary. I watched it twice in close succession and enjoyed it both time."
3,Nice seat,"Affordable and economical. A nice seat that was easy to install. the seat feels nice to the ""tush"" and looked good on the bike..."
5,Good Seat,Nice seat for the money. Cheaper than many seat covers (for those just looking for a color change). Shipped pretty quickly.
3,good replacement-kids seat,"A great aid when restoring a old bicycle it is a good quality seat and great for kids bicycle not much good for bikes over 20"""
1,Tru Glo Gobble dot sight,"Don't buy this, it does not look like the picture. It just tapes to the rib on your shotgun with 2 sided tape. At best a siingle use item. The sights are bright, but the mounting system is useless. spend your money on somehting that will last."
5,This book is great for all ages!,"I read this book as a child and loved it then. When I picked it up again to read it, I enjoyed it just the same! The story line is great, adn the illustrations are wonderful."
4,From Back Cover,"Rory Tanner loved women. But Macy Keller had been a burr under his saddle ever since she'd come to town, threatening the Tanner empire with scandal. Deeply protective of his family, Rory vowed to keep an eye on the mysterious Macy. And discovered the feisty beauty was keeping him up at night with scandalous thoughts...Macy had come to Tanner's Crossing to find her roots, but she couldn't resist blue-eyed cowboy Rory Tanner. A natural-born flirt, Rory seemed intent on discovering her secrets. Rory was the last man she should trust, yet soon she longed to share everything with him - including her heart![4th in The Tanners of Texas series]"
4,Color is the only way to go,"COMBAT! THE BEST OF THE COLOR EPSODES is the only DVD of this TV series to buy if you have limited time to watch these old classics. I would have rated it five stars if the Episodes had not included, Entombed. This episode is just not believable for me because my dad fought the Germans in WWII. Their officers would not have agreed to a temporary truce and that is the basis of this one story."
4,COMBAT--BEST OF THE COLOR EPISODES.,VERY GOOD PICTURE QUALITY. BROUGHT BACK CHILDHOOD MEMORIES AS THIS WAS MY FAVORITE TV SHOW. VERY GOOD PRICE.
1,WTF,"That's great that this is being used for a debate on Harry's genius ..... but why in the ____ is this book $230? Does it have some long lost secret chord in it? I don't think so .... they're just songs... great songs, but still just songs..... why would anyone pay that much money for for a songbook? I'll just use my ears .... easy enough ..... $230.00 ... that's some BS"
2,What's the point?,"Why would you buy a book like this if not to study for the test?This book is not enough to study for the test.Therefore, what's the point."
2,"Decent study guide, but poorly edited","This book is decently written. It's humorous, covers most of the necessary topics, and it's obvious that the authors know what they're talking about. Unfortunately, the book also appears to have been written over a weekend, as it is rife with typos. This can be very distracting (and potentially devestating on test day) for the Cisco novice that this book targets. The book comes with a CD with various tools to test your knowledge, such as practice tests, but this unfortunately also appears to be hastily written. Some of the programs don't even appear to be fully implemented (ie, click on a button and it takes you to a blank page). All in all, not a bad book, but I would avoid using it as your sole source of information, as it is just not trustworthy enough."
2,Not too great,"I purchased the A+ for Dummies study guide, and it did help me pass the A+ exam. I figured I could do it again with this book, as it's by the same author. This book is just not detailed enough, especially regarding WAN technologies. And it covers some material that just isn't very important, such as Appletalk. My suggestion would be to go with Todd Lammle's excellent CCNA Study Guide, it has everything you need for the exam in the right detail with no fluff. You almost certainly will not pass the CCNA with just this book. It might be good to learn certain new concepts, but only as a backup."
4,Ideal CCNA text book canpanion than the Exam Cram,"I do not think you should read only one text book for any certification exams, and you will be a lunatic to use Dunnies But for those who had though of it, Dummies CCNA is better that the Exam Cram. The Exam Cram is better for the Microsoft exams."
1,CCNA for Dummies,A book for CCNA hopefuls written by CCNA's. I would have hoped for someone with a little more Cisco ceritifcation experience. Need I say more?
3,Not for Test 640-507,"Words of caution. Test #640-507 was released in Aug of 2000. This book came out in April of 2000. I found out ""AFTER "" I read the book, took the test, didn't pass, and searched for new study material. The book cover says that it is for test 640-507 but it misses the mark. I found the book to be generally useful. Lots of good info. Everything was explained clearly. Good book to have on your desk. For test preperation, look for a newer book."
2,This book is incomplete and a disappointment,"I am a big fan of the ""Dummies"" series, as I couldn't have passed my half dozen MCSE tests without their help. I was able to get some information from it, but if I had made it my primary study guide, I don't think I could have bested 55-60% on the exam. I have noticed that everyone else that reviewed this book took the 640-407 exam. This book is supposed to be for the new 507, which is the one I took. This book falls far short in covering the switching and Wan protocols on the new exam. Also, the outpost game on the CD does not function properly. I know two other people that purchase it, and none of us was able to load it. This book will help as a companion, but it should be only a minor player in your study efforts."
3,"Great knowledge, bad package","The book is awesomely written by the authors, however it falls short of doing a good job. It's extreamly poorly edited. The question sections at the end of the chapters contain errors in the answers and even some of the questions! Also lab 13-1 is almost entirly wrong. All of chapter 15 is nothing but very poorly typed, highlighted router commands. Whoever was editing stopped after chapter 11, completely! Good book for someone who's already knowledgable about networking but if your new to it and think you could get certified don't look to this book as the best source. My advice is wait for a second printing of this book, hopefully they'll fix those errors. Overall good in knowledge. Worth the money for sure but you'll be confused by all of the errors if you don't have some knowledge already."
5,Great book but not complete,"Passed CCNA exam first time (897/1000) with a lot of help from this book. The first few chapters on OSI model and subnetting were very useful. But the best part was the test exams on CD. From the self-assessment, I found out what areas I was weak on. More information is needed for switches, WANs and access lists."
2,Not geared for the CCNA exam,"This book is good as a primer if you want consider achieving a CCNA. This book is not good as a study guide for the exam, due to its lack of granularity on most CCNA subjects."
2,Not worth it,"This book is a waste of money. It doesn't go into detail enough with certain topics, particularly WAN protocols, and has information completely irrelevant to the 507 exam, eg Appletalk. It seems to me that this book was written for the 407 exam and quickly reedited for the 507. The only thing this book might be useful for is to review certain OSI model topics, and that hardly justifies the price. My recommendation is to buy Todd Lammle's guide and a router simulator."
2,Not for the true techie.,Some of the statements in here are not stated in a true way for you to pass this Certification test.
3,Hopefully the 2nd version is better???,"I've read several Dummies books for other subjects. However, this book has lots of errors! Unfortunately I did not document all the errors, but really, isn't this the publisher's job?? The errors mostly occur in the chapter prep tests and on the practice test on the CD. These errors end up confusing me more than help me understand the material. I've emailed the publisher for a list of corrections, but they said they had no such list. In my humble opinion, this book isn't exactly the best study aid for the CCNA and certainly shouldn't be your only study aid!! However, it would be good to start off on this book, and get the clarification you need from another book as well."
5,"Great, funny and easy to read.","By far the most helpful resource in getting my CCNA. This book covers everything on the CCNA, a little more condensed than Wendell's book, (by the Cisco Press) but I believe Wendell's book hit every imaginable topic while Mr. Glister's hit only the relevent topics for the test.For [the priceyou will not make a mistake using this as a resource."
2,"Quick review, not single study source",The book claims to be all you need to pass the CCNA exam. It is my experience that this is incorrect. The most it can be used for is an overview at the beginning of your studies. The book does not go into enough detail to cover half of what is on the test. The included CD is full of bugs and the emulation software it promises is only a demo and the real software must be purchased if you plan on using it to pass the test. I think there are better book on the market and don't suggest wasting the money.
5,Single best resource for CCNA Exam...,"Of all the books, CDRoms, and sims that I used to study for the CCNA, this was the single best resource by far.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
3,Does not contain enough detail.,This book contains good foundational information about the CCNA exam. It is however not complete enough to use alone to prepare for 640-507. Read this book only if you are a networking novice.
3,It's alright - but not on it's own,"When preparing for the CCNA I purchased this text and found it to be a great introduction. Indeed, most all the material you'll find on the exam is covered. However, the exam requires some analysis, not just plug-and-chug answers. For a better understanding, I recommend Cisco's CCNA boxed set. I was displeased with this text because you'd occasionally find contradictions between the chapter and the Q&A at the end of the chapter. Bottom line - if you know Cisco routers, this will get you through the test. If you're new to Cisco, get a copy of the Cisco boxed set as well."
2,Written because of and due to a Pompous Audience,"If someone really understands even a fraction of what's being written in this book, then no doubt whoever does so goes looking at other books. These are brief, accurate statements. General applicability is minimal (local exactitude [percision] that misses global perfection [accuracy]). The book's sense of direction/purpose seems overwhelmed by an awareness of an audience that demands academic superiority to a degree where utility is beside the point."
4,Solano Professional Hairdryer,"This dryer is awesome, BUT whomever designed it didn't think!!!! They put the on/off high/low/ buttons on the handgrip! I keep turning the thing off while trying to dry my hair. It has a loooonnnnngggg cord!! Love that, great power, dries hair fast (if you don't have to keep turning it BACK on). That really gets me. Otherwise it's a keeper."
2,Mediocre,"The book consists of two examples of diarama building. Unfortunately, both are so and so. There are a few useful tidbits of advice (i.e., artificial grass out of brushes and some very basic priming and dry bushing) but nothing that is really for anyone beyond the beginner. Those interested in something over and above basic should look elsewhere."
3,How do you display your models?,"WWII Dioramas (Modelling Manuals)Some people display their models on a shelve or even in a clear plastic box. But if you've been in modelling very long, especailly building 1/32 or 1/35 scale armor, then you'll end up wanting to make the display as great as the model. This book gives you a place to learn how to do just that. My only problem with the book is that it jumps straight into a large diorama. I wish Osprey would come out with another book to help the beginner. Still it has become a reference tool for me."
3,Ok...but can't take even a litte rain.,"As a wetland scientist i've used this book repeatedly over the last 8 years. So far, I've gone through three of them. The book is helpful for identifying common wetland and upland plants in the NW, but the paper it's printed on is not water resistant and will stick together like glue if it gets wet making the book worthless. I wonder if that wasn't the plan all along to sell more copies of a regional plant book."
3,Te Amare,"This a good song... that I like the most, even is not played at this cd... but I would like to mention this."
2,Solo tiene 2 temas buenos.,"Este album esta muy lejos de la calidad de las producciones musicales anteriores de este cantante, en general, el mejor nivel en los 90 lo tuvo con Bajo el Signo de Cain (1993) y luego con Laberinto (1995) pertenecientes a su prometida trilogia, que creo no ha podido completar con este album ya en el 2002.Sugiero, al resto de los aficionados a este artista, comprar el CD solo para tener la coleccion completa."
4,Great Adventure book,This is a good book but a little to hard to understand for my 4 and 6 year olds. I think we'll wait a few more years to pursue reading. :o)
5,Great historical novel,"This is an excellent look into the Third Crusade. It is historically accurate, although it deosn't go deeply into the history"
1,Good thing it was free,"While I was reading the book I kept wondering why I continued. The story line was farfetched with 'boy wonder"" Cuthbert. The writing was not well done and it did not seem well researched either. I would have asked for my money back if I had paid anything for the book."
3,OUTDATED,"I bought this vhs because I needed something inexpensive to show on the subject of prayer, in my prayer group. While it was okay, it mostly shows the scientific proof that those who are prayed for, versus those not prayed for, are more apt to recover more quickly, when undergoing surgery, etc. If you are looking for something along the lines of current, contemporary ""spirit-filled"" ministries you might want to shop around."
1,Be careful,This is NOT a book about home defense. It is a book about homeland defense! And the homeland is the UK.
3,Cute but runs small.,I wear a size 8/10 usually.I ordered this jacket in a large as I knew I would be wearing bulky sweaters under it.It is pretty small fitting for a large.Otherwise it's a cute jacket.
4,warm jacket,"thicker than I thought, if you live in a cold place it's pretty good as a warm jacket at low price."
5,"A Real ""Scorcher""","This book of male models is not a ""Heatwave"" it's a ""Miami Scorcher."" Ron Williams has gathered together 14 very handsome, muscular young men, photographed in brilliant color. I usually like black and white photography better because I believe it has more feeling, but this new collection of Ron William's is breathtaking in its exciting photos of men in outdoor surroundings. I especially enjoyed models, ""Federico, Aaron & Carlos."" What handsome & masculine men they are. Most models are photographed in swimwear, shorts, jeans & underwear. There is no need for frontal nudity, the men are much more erotic shown this way.Ron Williams is an Emmy Award winning director living in Miami, who has created many corporate commercials in the last 20 years. He is well-known for his VistaMen series of physique art videos showcasing many stunning sensual men who are physique models. I really enjoyed this book & hope to see more books published of his fine photography in the near future."
4,Surprise,Glenn Close's voice is great especially on songs that are strong and loud. Soft sounds aren't her forte in my opinion but Placido Domingo is always great.
1,Flimsy,"The picture for this item is very deceiving. The boy on the box can't be older than two because the vest looks huge on him and in fact, it is very short. I ordered it for my four-year-old son and it stops just below his waist, which looks a little silly with his t-shirt coming down to his hips. Also, on the box the blue near the collar appears to be the aqua color that Diego wears but in reality it is a light/medium blue. The vest seems to be made of a very thin micro nylon fabric that is so flimsy it doesn't even close in the front and just hangs open. There are two velcro straps on each side of the vest that hold the front and back of the vest together. Our box arrived with a big dent in the side and the binoculars were smashed. This being said, I know Amazon will replace the binoculars and we'll begrudgingly keep it, as my son really wants to be Diego for Halloween."
1,Let down,"First off, yes, the vest runs small. Second, because it is the thinnest, cheapest nylon, with velcro on the sides (adjustable that way, I guess), it easily gets twisted and all the velcro is caught up with itself, and my son (4) needs help straightening it out. It is VERY difficult for a child to clip the tools on to the little loops, as well, so the vest has been tossed aside. The ""canteen""? A TOTAL waste- it is a round piece of plastic. It doesn't open, so you can't even pack a bit of water for them. That got tossed aside. The cell-phone looking thing works alright- he plays with it occasionally, but the phrase repertoire is limited, so in retrospect, I bought this junk for the binoculars, which are cute, and easy to look through because it's actually one wide opening, and my son likes those, so if you want to pay for those, then have at it."
1,Don't waste you money,This is cheap junk and isn't worth more than $15. The vest is made out of material similar to a disposable tablecloth or something. The communicator came with dead batteries that cost $15 dollars to replace. I had to rush order the Nickelodeon 3-piece outfit in time for Halloween--that outfit cost $25 dollars and all 3 pieces are decent quality kid's clothing that they can wear anytime.
4,Pluses and Minuses,"Pluses: Backpack is super durable and large enough to actual use, but sling back type is hit and miss with some kids. Binoculars perfect for 2 year old, with extra large viewfinder that they can see thru. Baby Jaguar is cute and large enough.Minuses: Vest is very very light weight cloth and does not attach in front. Canteen does not open, ok for pretend. Talking radio is intermittent in working.Some kids loved it, others didn't play with it at all, just like any toy."
4,every independent filmmaker should own this book,every independent filmmaker should own this book. I found it very useful on locating the major festivals & the do's & don'ts with applying to festivals. Highly recommended.
1,"USELESS, SELF-SERVING, AND TRIVIAL","This book has no real info of value and too much self-serving info that has no value. How to stand in a line? How to eat popcorn? It's either common sense or it's mind-bendingly trivial. Whew, what a waste."
2,An idea in search of an editor. Too much useless info.,"Best bars? Best restaurants? Who cares? Gore seems to think just jamming in every note he ever took makes a good book. WRONG. This is tedious when not ridiculous. I'll give it two stars instead of one, because you can find some useful tidbits here, but you have to wade through so many ""cute"" Gore observations that you can never find it. How 'bout a guide to the best restrooms at festivals next time, Gore? Or the best parking spaces? If you tell us where the best garbage cans are, I suggest you pitch two-thirds of your notes into that can, and focus on the third that really matters. Besides, this book is already out of date."
5,Must Have For Any Filmmaker,"This book is a much needed addition for any filmmaker. Not only does it list an extensive amount of festivals, it gives solid info about each festival that you usually don't find on the festival's website. Chris Gore also did a wonderful thing, he has top ten lists for categories such as; top ten underground fests, top ten digital media fests, etc. You don't want to blindly send out your film and pay the outragous festival fees if you know your film doesn't fit the vibe of the festival you are sending to. With this book you will avoid doing this. If you only get one book before sending your film out to festivals, get this one!"
3,Needs an update,"The first half of this book contains generic film-festival information (on applying to and attending festivals, a diary from the ""Blair Witch"" makers, etc.) which contains some good material. The meat of the Guide, though, is the series of entries about hundreds of specific festivals making up the second half. And here, the age of the book (published in 2001) becomes a problem. Putting it bluntly, if you bought this book as research material for submitting your own film to festivals, you'll find a lot of festivals listed here that simply don't exist anymore, as well as much out-of-date information about those festivals still in existence. Needless to say, it also lacks any mention of the many festivals that started after this book went to the printer. After three years, Gore really needs to update this or, better yet, make it an annual."
3,It is a good software for beginers,It is an excellent for people who want to get their feet wet in Graphic Animation
3,Weather station,Works almost accurate .I love the projection of outdoor temp and time during night which is the coolest feature of this weather station . I recommend buying this . I donot know how long it will last as the first one had some problem and I returned to amazon.I bought it because it has all the feature of expensive weather station .In other words its a complete weather station .If it works well then its really a good value for the money.The worst is the customer service as there is no one who pick up the phone and they donot have tool free number.
5,A GREAT WEATHER STATION,I HAVE USED THIS WEATHER STATION 7 DAYS.IT IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE.WHEN I FIRST INSTALLED THE BATTERIES IN BOTH UNITS EVERYTHING WORKED PERFECT.AFTER READING THE SHORT MANUEL IT IS VERY EASY TO PROGRAM.I LIKE THE WAY YOU CAN SET THE PROJECTOR TO DISPLAY ON THE CEILING IN 4 DIFFERENT POSITIONS. THE WEATHER FORCASTER HAS BEEN ON TARGET EVERY DAY. HAVING INDOOR AND OUTDOOR TEMPS AND HUMIDITY IS GREAT.IAM AMAZED HOW ACCURATE THE TEMP AND HUMIDITY IS ON THIS UNIY.THE ALARM AND SNOOZE IS GREAT.THIS IS THE BEST WEATHER STATION I HAVE HAD.
4,Miss Anyweather Pig is a great toy!,Miss Anyweather Pig is a great toy for anyone who is interested and working on their self-help skills. She is very cute and comes with three outfits. There is a boy dog who I think we will buy for our son too.
5,Message of the Tarot,"In her relentless Quest to restore the lost Bride of Christ - the sacred feminine so long ignored and repudiated by the Church -Margaret Starbird's journey takes a new turn with a fascinating interpretation of the 22 cards that form the Major Arcana of the Tarot. Delving into a world most people associate with fortune telling, she explores European history, medieval art and Scripture to conclude that the earliest Tarot Trumps sprang directly from medieval roots in northern Italy and the Languedoc of Southern France. Readers will be impressed with her powerful arguemnts suggesting that the Major Arcana is in fact a visual depiction of the 'Great Secrets' of the alternative Christian church, the 'Church of the Holy Grail', preserved in a fashion that would not arouse the suspicions of those who sought to stamp it out completely."
4,fascinating,"This books isn't as good as some of her others, especially the Goddess in the Gospels and The Woman With the Alabaster Jar, but it's very interesting and has some genuine validity. She writes well."
3,Disappointing,"This book contains ONLY 47 pages that are from Bernadette's ""private notes."" And only 6 pages from her ""journal."" The remainder of the book contains uninspiring, boring, personal letters that Bernadette wrote to different people. Most of them are very short letters. In fact, most of them are actually notes. In them Bernadette thanks people for various things, or admonishes her younger family members. The 47 pages of ""private notes"" are inspiring and beautiful. Also, chapter 1 consists of only 6 pages. They are the only 6 pages from Bernadette's ""journal"" that are in this book. In this chapter, Bernadette briefly tells the story (not in detail) of the apparitions and her arrest afterwards. Someone should have taken the 47 pages that are from Bernadette's ""private notes"" and the 6 pages from Bernadette's ""journal"" and made them into a booklet. Together, those 53 pages are worth reading. But the rest of the book is a not. ( By the way, today is the feast day of Our Lady of Lourdes : )"
3,It was alright,I thought it was boring at first but when you get into the book it gets kind of interesting. I think the author could have done a better job explaining his raps and they kept swithching from finding the treasure to doing something in the hood so you never knew what was happening and he switched the characters so many times it was hard to figure out which character was talking. I think if you want to read this book go check it out dont buy it because its a waste of your money.
3,My Review,"I really enjoyed The Mouse Rap because it had a lot of different conflicts going on, and I think that the raps in every chapter are cool. The author Walter Dean Myers has a great personality and the book is great for any teenagers or adults to read. It is enjoyable to read a book when you are rapped up and who wants to wait and see what happens next."
2,It was not good,This book for the most part was boring!!! I only liked the part when they went to the bank and got all the money. I also liked the characters but that's all. I would give this book two stars. I think the author coul have concentrated in one part liked the bank than in like ten things a chapter. I would probably like this book if that happened. I would really not recomend this book. Don't buy it.
4,My review not yours,"I think the Mouse Rap is really an exciting book for kids that like books of adventurous happenings in each chapter you read. This book is good for several reasons. One reason is because Walter Dean Myers is an outstanding writer for kids and teenagers. He writes from experience in his life and what he knows. This book I think was a book I could recommend to my friends and others. I am now reading one of his best selling books ""Monster"" and so far it has really caught my attention. I would recommend this book from 12 years old and up. So as you can see Walter dean Myers is a writer that you can understand where his point of view is coming from."
4,This book is awesome,The Mouse Rap is a Sensational book for all people that can read. This book is exiting interesting and fresh. It has a new rap every chapter you will not be able to put this book down. It has a great story and the author make you feel like your actually there when your not. I reccommend this book to any of your freinds. If you don't like this book you should go to the docter and check for brain surgery becuase something is wrong.I cant stop talking about it I would write how great this is all day except I would run out of big wordsThis Book is great
4,Vulcan for Dummies,"Spock's World fleshes out the background of one of ST:TOS's most beloved characters. Who are these people with the odd ears and horrible haircuts?Perhaps most useful is the understanding one gets of that key Vulcan trait: Control of emotions. It turns out that there are important historical reasons for Vulcans to want to control strong emotions and follow a more ""logical"" path.Admittedly, the story is a tad bit disjointed. But the clear writing style and the excellent back-story more than make up for chapter-flipping."
3,"Would've been five stars, but . . . .","I read the hardcover novel first, and it is one of the four best Star Trek novels I've ever come across. This book, and _Wounded Sky_, were what first brought my attention to Diane Duane's other work.I was horribly disappointed, then, when I got the audio-cassette version, and they had to cut out so much of the gleefully fun parts!My favorite crystal spider is gone from the audio version. Well, durn and a half, but I suppose I can understand that the production team had *no* idea how to represent that character's unique voice.However, they also cut out several of the plot-building scenes, and too many speeches from the actual debate. They cut out the sense of humor between Sarek and Amanda, when they're travelling with the _Enterprise_ to Vulcan.After a while, I just couldn't bear to listen. Other folks can keep their audio-taped books; I'll stick with the old-fashioned paper."
2,I expected better.,"This book could have been good, except every other chapter is history of Vulcan and has little to do with the actual story. I suggest skipping over the history lessons and just reading the chapters entitled ""Enterprise."""
4,"Hey,even speeches can be fun sometimes... :)","I liked the speeches(evident from my review title ;)),and the Enterprize crew interactions - bulletin board and in person.Everything involving McCoy,Kirk, and of course Spock was revealing their inner feelings,and therefore interesting.I liked the scene with Kirk in Ireland in the beginning of the book.The parts about Sarek,Amanda,and Amanda with T'Pau are captivating.And,while it was interesting to read about Surak and the reason Vulcans became logic-driven and in super control of their emotions,the rest of the history part was boring.In any case,it is a good book to read,although you might consider skipping some chapters..."
3,Vulcan to secede from the Federation?,"That is the plot that drives Spock's World, a novel that, as the traditional Star Trek intrigue unfolds on one level, treats us to a detailed history of the planet Vulcan on another. The pseudo-epic tale follows the planet and its inhabitants from its literal creation on through to the working out of the Vulcan government's current troubles with the Federation (cagily rooted in a particular episode of the original series).How well the novel adheres to the Trek Mythos I will leave to those more well versed in its complex and multiple series spanning arc. But taken as a novel in a genre I do not frequently read, I found it to be a well written and diverting piece of lightweight (despite its epic pretensions) entertainment, nothing more. Strictly for the fans or Trek curious."
3,"Not really Star Trek canon, but fills in some gaps","This title certainly will help the reader to understand parts of the planet Vulcan's history much better. Overall, the novel is mostly faithful to the broader Star Trek universe, and the sections on Vulcan's history are compelling reading. The only portion that I wondered about was the section that covers the life of Surak, where he is placed in an industrial Vulcan society very similar in style to that of contemporary earth, which is definitely not the image that I had of Surak from previous Trek lore. Nevertheless, this was a fairly good read."

Converting their current publications into 199 page long PDF files, and marketing that as a CBT is irresponsible and misleading on Cisco's part. (Cisco never even MENTIONS Adobe Acrobat or PDF files in their product descrptions or packaging.)The testing software also has some design flaws. (i.e. If your time expires in study mode, the test will not get graded or reviewed.)I am extremely disappointed with this product, and in Cisco. This is NOT a CBT, this is an E-book with a test program."
4,Cisco CCNA Training Kit Exam #640-507,"The software package delivers as promised with all the information you need to know and test simulations to pass the real deal, but the user interface needs some polishing, and one serious consideration before buying this program. How much time do you want to spend home in front of your computer studying, assuming you already spend 8-10 hrs at work in front of a workstation. Take into account that Cisco press already has the CCNA Library kit w/all the info needed to pass the test and a test sim CD is included in the kit. it's a matter of personal choice books w/sim test or same books and test in digital format. I would have taken the books if given a second choice."
3,Cute but not for my 3year old,"Basically this book is good--board book, short and cute, explains the Easter story without getting into the gory details (to which I don't want to expose my 3 year old). I don't need the last 2 pages ""Jesus loved us so much he gave his life so we could live""--yes this is the Easter message. I just don't think my daughter will understand it at age 3."
5,Just enough words for a toddler to remember,"I was so impressed with the Christmas version of this book, given to me as a gift, that I am now purchasing the entire collection of holiday stories (Valentines, Easter, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving). This book is just perfect for toddlers. First, its a board book style, built for many readings and little fingers...next the story is both meaningful and easily stated, just enough words for a toddler to remember. The books explain religious stories and how they are celebrated. I liked relating this with my children, who are at the age where they soak in new experiences from everything around them."
2,"Ok, but pictures very 70's","This book is alright, but the pictures almost kill it. Very 70's looking and kinda strange. Wouldn't recomend it, but the other book by candycane press ""What is Easter?"" is great and you should get that one instead."
3,The Story of Easter review,"I bought this board book for my son so I can start planting seeds early on about the importance of Easter. I thought the words were great, but the illustrations were lacking. For such a serious topic, the pictures were a bit on the strange side and some just seemed completely out of place with the words next to them. I was a bit disappointed in the book and would recommend buying another board book on Easter if you can find it or a Kids Bible."
3,A Pleseant Surprise,"Bullseye was One of My Final Purchases in the Galactus Series. Even though He is Usually a Well-Written Character, his ""Traditional"" Costume has Always Looked Tacky and Gaudy to Me. After Attaching the Galactus Piece, I Got a Good Look at the Figure. Great Sculpt, Good Shaping on the Muscles and Costume. But the Face was the Kicker. Great Detail, Ferocious Expression and Elegant Bone Structure. With Articulation like the Early Spider-Man Figures, but a Slightly Beefier Build, He Quickly Rose to the Top of My Selection of Villians. I'm Certainly Not Lacking in Daredevils for Him to Fight, Either : )Being One of the Lithe (although Not Particularly Top Heavy) Characters Does Make Him a bit Tricky to Pose, But Much Easier than War Machine or Deathlok. I Try to Pose Him on Existing Structures in the Room (like a Window Sill or Entertainment Center) or Put Him on a Base. A Great Figure and Certainly Worth the Investment."
3,digital door lock,The product works well as described. I was a little disappointed that the lock has to be taken apart to change the combination.
5,solid accessible art history,this was an excellent exhibition that includes an excellent catalogue in tow...I am an art historian and I was so pleased to see a text that wasn't simply full of medium-resolution images with superficial history included. I am so glad this was a scholarly project that was well researched and written by some of the best people in the field. it was a refreshing change from most museum catalogues these days that cater only to the general public with nothing substantial for academes. Still the writing is easily digestible for a person of any level of interest in art to learn from.
1,Woodcraft Dodo Press Version is Lacking,"I recently purchased the Dodo Press edition of Woodcraft and it is lacking compared to the Dover edition. Both are the abridged versions of this classic, but the Dodo Press version doesn't have the great sketches from the earlier editions and that are included in the Dover edition. Stick with the Dover version and don't buy this one."
1,Defective Microwave - Whirlpool Gold GT4175SPQ,"Per a Consumer Reports recommendation, I bought this model just over 6 months ago in the fall of 09. The turntable stopped working before December. Two repair calls later the motor and arm had been replaced (under warranty) and it worked again. That is until now when the same problem happened again. This time I noticed that the arm has black marks where it broke from the motor. Could this have caught on fire? I hope this is not a common problem but as I've used reviews on Amazon myself before purchasing, I thought I'd share my experience with this Microwave (Whirlpool Gold GT4175SPQ)."
4,the title says it all,"This is a collection of Kenyan guitar band music from the 1960s and early 1970s, before it was stylistically supplanted the more dance-oriented, Zairean-influenced, benga. Typical line-up is two guitarists, one playing lead, one rhythm, and simple percussion (shakers etc.) accompanying a vocalist. Sometimes there is a bass, horns, or a flute. Most of the songs might be described as folk-pop: relatively simple melodies and accompaniment. The version of ""Malaika"" that is included would be on the pop end of the spectrum. Cut for the ages: a Swahili version of ""La Bamba."" The collection closes with a song celebrating Kenya's first great runner, and later a great humanitarian, Kip Keino."
1,This product has alcohol in it.,"Thus, you may expect that this ""treatment"" will strip your hair, and that Fantasia has either little idea or little regard for what constitutes a healthy addition to one's hair and scalp regimen.I was unhappy to pour this down the drain, but in the absence of a mortal enemy, I would give this product to no one else."
1,Unprofessionally packed,Half of this product was spilled out of the bottle!Due to the bottle not being sealed.There was however a strip of tape on the top of the bottle that was not a factory strip of tape!
1,Don't waste your money,"There is nothing ""gymnastic"" about this DVD. It is plain-old water fitness using a few different pieces of equipment (a disc, a bar, and a noodle). I am a certified aqua aerobics instructor and there are many moves featured on the DVD that I would never do in my class due to potential injury, especially to the shoulder."
1,Pathetic,"I expected a high energy DVD/CD that could be used to first to watch, and later as music/instructions for a hearty water workout. This is a slow workout, instructions translated (poorly) from a foreign language, with soft unenergizing background music. I should have returned it."
3,overall good,"I purchased the Power Aerobics DVD to help get some ideas for teaching my water aerobics classes. The exercises are safe and effective and can be taken up or down in intensity if you'd like. The DVD is very repetitive in that you see lots of the same move before moving on, but it's a good workout and I would recommend this DVD. With this price you can't really go wrong!"
2,Good for quick reading,"Although not a blockbuster in terms of new, new-age material, I found this book enjoyable in spurts. I do like the material on the mind-body connection. Otherwise, the Yoga exercises described are pretty much cut and dried. Would I buy this book if I knew its' contents? No. It takes a lot for me to purchase a book that I cannot find at my local library or one that I 'must have'. Unless you're a newcomer to the world of alternative health, this book is rehashed and remarketed material."
4,Great Little Book,Great little book that provides simple yet effective techniques for slowing down and enjoying the moment.Includes chapters on:MeditationColor TherapyBreathing TechniquesPrayerand much more.Recommended
2,The Mormon Murders,This book is not what I expected. I read the story of Mark Hoffman about 20 years ago and have been trying to find the book lately. What I received was an eight and one half by eleven manuscript that was more like a legal document than a book. I am disappointed.
3,a good replacement sight,I recently replaced the factory sights on my mossberg 535 with this product. It has plenty of adjustment room which is what I needed. It was easy to install and easy to sight in. The only reason I give it three stars is because the fiber optics could be a little larger. It just takes a little getting used to. Still effective for spring gobbler hunting.
3,"Great but one ""small"" issue","This sight is great and fit right on my Franchi i-12, however, they are very small. It is rather hard to see the front sight when looking down the gun because it is pretty tiny. I would opt for the larger model next time."
5,Right part-right price,I don't know how Amazon was able to sell this fuel module for more than $100 less than anybody else but they did. Even paying the overnight shipping it was worth it to save more than $100.Genuine Delphi part fit my truck with no problem and I am on the road again.
1,wrong product,Was not the gloves that was in the picture I work at a tire shop and I thought I was getting a tire mounting type of glove not a impact type of glove not very happy
5,Excellent material for beginner's Hawaiian Slack Key,"Ozzie Katani has been the most instrumental and established slack key guitar teacher in Hawaii. This book and cd is by far the best available material for the beginner player. He uses tabliture, gives pointers, and the cd allows you to hear how it is supposed to sound. I would highly recommend getting this book to anyone interested in learning traditional Hawaiian Slack Key guitar. It could not be made anymore simple and straight forward and you can not beat the price."
5,A Triumph,"With this effort, Jason proves that talented singer-songwriters do still exist. If you've had enough of lyrics about teen angst and/or the joys of new wealth, this album is for you. Keep it alive, Jason."
3,"Not good, Not bad","I bought the book because the ""good reviews"" on Amazon. I am sorry that I don't agree it really a so good one though it does provide a good entry mehtod, TTE. I bought Vol.I,2 & 3 and I think you only need to buy Vol. 1 since there are so many repeated or similar Vol. 1 materials in the other two."
4,Great for a beginner,"I wish this was the first book I read when I first picked up reading. It stresses trading off simple price patterns without all the indicators. Fairly easy to read with some good points, this book seemed more directed to the beginner to intermediate level trader. I wouldn't label this a 'must-own' book, but more of a highly recommend to read/borrow."
5,Don't trade without it.,"Expensive, but cheap compared to 95% of most trading books out there. Full of practial things not found in other books. Gives a good foundation. Do yourself a favor and study this book before throwing money away in the market. Many eye opening truths and common sense."
5,"Awesome, sturdy, but no accessories ...","I made one for my son a few years back. It was a fun project, but not near as nice as this. Assembly was easy enough - 10 minutes or so. I am confident this will last for years on end.Please note that it does not come with paper, chalk, paint, or markers etc... I am not sure if I missed this when I bought it. Package came fast and safely boxed up.A great prodcut for young kids ..."
3,IKEA's one is only $15.00,Just to let everyone know that IKEA has a great quality easel for only $15.00. What a steal!!!! Why overpay???? We got an IKEA one and LOVE it ;).
4,Nice easel but chalkboard needs work,"Nice easel except for the chalkboard but I solved that problem. First, I did have to prime it many times using the Melissa & Doug Jumbo chalk. What priming basically does is it sands the board down so that it will be easier to write. Second, I realized that the chalk my child was using on it was horrible. For priming the Melissa & Doug Jumbo chalk is fine but not for actually writting with it. The M&D; dustless multicolored chalk is better but what really worked on this chalkboard is thisDIX61400 - Prang Hygieia Dustless Board Chalk, 3-1/4 x 3/8, Assorted, 12 Sticks/Box. These Prang chalks has vibrant colors, they write really smoothly and thickly and they are of great quality."
4,Great product,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and it was a wonderful purchase. I was a little worried about some of the reviews I had read about the chalkboard quality, however, all worries were dispelled once I used the products. I wonder whether some of the people who had problems with the chalkboard realize you need to ""season"" the board before using by lightly covering it with chalk dust. My daughter loves the easel. We draw pictures and leave each other little surprise notes on it. This is a great gift for any little artist."
3,kids love to takke apart,"My kids who are 3 and 1 1/2 years old love this product; however, they love to unscrew the colorful screws that hold it together even more. I now have to try to size and buy new screws at a hardware store to keep it together. It is a great product for development of large motor skills which will lead to the development of fine motor skills necessary for writing. My suggestion is to either buy a different product or know that it will need to be closely supervised."
3,Fun,Would be nice if part of this was magnetic to hold paper in place without using the clips as they aren't always useful if paper is too short. Son has a wonderful time with this easel & it is extremely well made.
5,Very good Christmas present which will be enjoyed for years,"Good sturdy product, well built and will give years of enjoyment to my grandchildren. The supplies with it were excellent."
5,Study and LARGE!,This is a great easel. Very sturdy and large. My son has played with this every day. It wasn't too terrible hard to put together either.
4,Easy to put together,This product was easy to put together and the quality of the item was pretty good. it will grow with children and its not too bulky. If you have a little artist on your hands i would recomment this.
3,Disappointed not magnetic! Needs a lot of work!!!,"Very disappointed this white board was not magnetic, really looking forward to this feature! Needed to do sooo much work to it! after reading reviews I had to paint the green board black, but took 6 coats! And also painted the frame expresso as the expresso one was twice the price!"
5,Love it love it...,"Hours of painting fun. Paint brush one time, markers another and chalk too. Easily put together. Best part, you can adjust the height..."
5,Creativity abounds,I bought thus for my niece and she loves it. It was very high quality. She also likes to use it to play school. She is about 6. I think it is the kind of toy that will grow with the child
4,Nice for the price,"Very nice for the price. Easy to put together. Dry erase board was hard to clean off. Overall, I would recommend this product to a friend."
5,Nice easel!,"I love this easel for my 3 yr, old as she is already artistically inclined and LOVES to draw and color the day away. It seems very sturdy and durable, obviously important when being used by a 3 yr, old, and I love that the bolts have smooth plastic covers. My daughter has already used and abused the chalk board and it is still looking great! The paper that pulls through is wonderful for painting, but she hasn't learned that the marker is strictly for the dry erase, so she used it on the paper and we had to explain to her. I think this will be truly excellent for cultivating her creativity and imagination and is a very useful educational tool as we can use it for her to practice writing as well as drawing and painting. I am very pleased with this purchase!"
2,NOT Worth the $$,"It's very tempting for parents to want to get this sort of thing. . . but unless your kids are really into art, it isn't worth it.1. it takes up A LOT of space2. it leads to constant messes. I am picking up chalk all the time.3. my son's favorite thing about this easel was to disassemble it. :)We found 2 better alternatives which we do USE all the time.1. A magnetic black board which hangs on our entryway wall. Used all the time. Takes up NO SPACE. Hung with Command Strips. Total with markers, $302. using masking tape, tape pieces of paper to the kids table. Let them go crazy. Clean up. Super cheap."
2,Arsenic,"I know the tests were done in 2009 (when my mother bought this for my daughter), but Healthystuff.org says in 2009 the white board part of this easel tested positive for arsenic.My daughter loves this easel and also has the Melissa & Doug easel companion set that came with paint, chalk, paintbrushes, erasers etc and loves those too. The chalk works great. The paper roll that I believe comes separate as well is awesome tho the paper is a little thin.If I had known then that this had arsenic I would've taken it back but she's been playing with it for a year now...a little late."
3,"Easel too big, chalkboard useless","I really wanted to buy my kids an easel and went with this one because of the great reviews. It's cute and pretty high quality, but I have a few issues with it. It's large and I can't find a place for it in our house. The chalkboard is really awful. Just useless. I was really disappointed."
3,"Not so great assembly instructions - Eraser, paper, markers not included.","The assembly instructions are frustrating, and you'll know exactly what I mean when you start putting this bad boy together. Doesn't come with paper, markers, or eraser."
4,hours of fun!,"Easy to put together. Found that the large sidewalk chalk works best on blackboard side. My daughter spends hrs. drawing and painting, she loves it!"
5,Soooooo Happy I chose this easel for my little guy!!!!!!!!,This was a Christmas gift for my 3 year old. I shopped for 3 months to find the right easel for him and this is by far the best one out there!!!!! Not only is the price great but it's sturdy! It's easy to put together!! The chalkboard works great!! It has a place for the paper roll! And ... it will grow with your child!! We've only had it a few days and so far this is his favorite gift and mine!!! Don't look any further ... This is the easel for you!!!! LOVE IT!!!!
5,A great children's gift,"This is a great product. I had read a review that said the chalkboard wasn't any good, so didn't know what to expect. The chalkboard works just fine. My two granddaughters age 2 and 5 just love it. They will both play, one on each side at the same time. I have some great works created by my budding artists."
4,Successful Purchase,"A great investment for you little artist. Adjustable, sturdy and easy to move. This is a favorite."
5,A great buy for creative kids,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She has used this easel almost daily. It has really brought out her creative side. It is very sturdy. You must buy the paper rolls, paints, brushes, chalk, etc. because they do not come with it. I'm glad that they keep the price low by not including everything with it. You can customize the accesories to fit your childs tastes. The trays are able to hold many supplies and keeps them organized. It makes it very easy for a child to paint on their own without making a mess of tabletops or countertops. I read many reviews before I bought it. Several people complained about the chalk board, but if you prime it like others suggested it works great."
5,Fun for all ages,"This easel is durable, sturdy and fun for my 3 year old and 6 year old. There a places for paints, pens and chalk. I did buy easel paper to put on the roll and an extra starter kit. They play with this at least once a day, which is more than I can say for some of their other toys. Great value!"
2,Way overpriced for a children's art easel,The good: It's a functional art easel that is child friendly.The bad: Very flimsy and way over priced for what you get. Ikea sells a comparable kids art easel for much cheaper.
3,nice easel,It was easy to put together and well made. We like it very much. The only thing that I don't like is that it doesn't fold up to store.
4,"Nice set, versatile and great for the kids","This was a gift, and although I wanted the plastic easel for my 5 year old, this was nice too. The pros are that it is versatile being it includes paper for painting, dry erase board and chalkboard too. The paint jars are awesome because its almost mess free because there is just a small opening where the paintbrush goes into the cap to get the paint. The cons are, it took forever to put together and is awkward to fold up. Overall its a very nice gift but I still think the plastic version would be easier to set up and put away."
2,cheap wood,"We received this as a gift. My two+ year old was ecstatic about this. We set it up easily enough and she began drawing on it right away. While putting it together I noticed the wood was bowed in a couple of locations on both legs. That bothered me, but I thought it would be fine. However, it seems I should have been more concerned. As she moved it slightly, across our wood floors where there was no resistance, one of the legs snapped right into. It should not have been so easy to break. I'm sure it was the cheap wood the main frame/legs are made of. The rest is nice, but now what do I do without a frame? Reconstruct a new one? Not happy about it."
5,Great buy for 2 year old!,"My son received this for his 2nd birthday and loves it. It was easy to put together by myself. One of the screw caps didn't work due to plastic melted on the threading and I will say that Melissa and Doug's customer service was excellent and sent a replacement immediately and called for follow up to make sure everything worked well. My son loves both the paint side and the chalkboard. I was happy he received it with theMelissa & Doug Easel Accessory Set. The only thing I needed to buy was more dry erase markers. I like that it is adjustable so on the lowest height, it is perfect for him now, and will continue to grow with him. 2-6 year olds have been playing with it and like it."
4,Good quality for the price,"Although this is mostly MDF, the product is durable and feels sturdy. It does not feel cheap. I would recommend this."
4,Kid Friendly,"I was definitely surprised with this. I wasn't sure how many pieces it was going to come in. But it was very easy to assemble; my boyfriend did it in a matter of 10 min tops. It has 2 different heights, so it grows with your child. We haven't tried out the chalkboard part yet, but I am aware that it might not work that well. However, after reading further reviews you can use chalkboard paint just as well. I am thoroughly impressed with this item!! Well worth the money."
2,great idea..what a pain to put together!,The holes were not lined up to put this together late on Christmas Eve. Had to get out a drill to make it work. She loves it but the quality of the workmanship sucks
3,Dissapointed,I have had other positive experiences wtih Melisaa & Doug products but i am pretty dissapointed with the Easel. My bigggest frustration is the chalk board which has some strange coating on it making it very difficult to actually draw on with chalk. My kids love charlk boards but they tossed this aside in 2 minutes. The paint/wipe board side is great and they love it but wish they would actually replace this with a real chalk board.
5,Great gift for my 3 year old son!!,"I got this easel for my 3 year old son and his close friend (also 3 year old) for christmas gift. Both are excited to use it. It is sturdy and easy to setup. I got the easel paper roll as well as the easel kit does not have any accessories. It fits well. My son starts to use the easel a lot every day. We are very happy with this purchase!!!PS: One of the tray was broken in the package, (not from shipping). My friend called the customer care of melissa and doug company. They are very nice. A replacement tray was to sent her address. Very good customer care. Highly recommend to all."
3,Quality is lacking,"I bought this for my soon-to-be 2-yr-old daughter for Christmas. She loves to color, draw, and paint. I did not open it right away until it was time to set it up for Christmas. That is when I noticed that the 2 boards (chalkboard and white board) seemed very cheaply made. My husband said it was super easy to assemble, but I was very disapointed that the chalkboard surface did not feel like a regular chalkboard surface at all. It's glossy and not smooth. The white board is not magnetic which is one of the cool things about dry/erase boards. We decided to keep it since it was fairly inexpensive and my daughter would be very unhappy if we took it away.I've pretreated the chalkboard side (covered with chalk) and still unhappy with it. I will probably end up buying chalkboard paint to coat it."
4,"I got this as a Xmas gift in 2009 for Grand Daughter, loved it","I bought this through Amazon, forgot the seller's info and this was wonderful until I had to take it down to take to my Grand Daughter's home. In the process I misplaced one of the nuts and of course didn't find out for months later. Now I also purchased extra paper and the art supplies suggested the both Grand Daughters (one wanted dolls for Xmas that year) loved playing with them but they were unable to use the boards. That has worked out quite well when the weather is comfortable and they can play outside but for the still many cool/cold days we have here in Texas the board would be more helpful. I would recommend this to anyone, however if there is a better way to keep track of the nuts. Oh, I haven't found where I can buy replacements and would love any suggestions :)"
3,Grandma's opinion,"Easy assembly, cute design, double sided so both boys can play, create and enjoy the fun at the same time. It isn't as easy to fold and stow as I thought it would be, and in tight quarters, leaving it up is a bit of a space issue, though overall, it's a good creation station. I almost want to get one for my house, too."
2,Chalkboard is horrible and pieces come off easily,My 2 1/2 yr old son actually loves this product but he loves to take it apart as well. We tighten the little colored pegs and a few weeks later he's taking them off again. So far he's brought me pretty much everything that can come off including bolts with small washers. Thank goodness he's past the stage of sticking everything in his mouth. Also like everyone else we've had the same problem with the chalk board scratching just from writing on it with chalk. I've always liked the Melissa and Doug products we've purchased but I wouldn't reccomend this easel at all.
3,Chalkboard very disappointing,The chalkboard side was a real disappointment. We did as the instructions said to season the chalkboard but it just doesn't work well. The surface is very slippery and the chalk barely writes on it. When it does some of the green will come off and most of the times it will even leave scratches.It wasn't too complicated to assemble and is fairly sturdy.
3,I wanted to give it 5 stars but...,"I was really happy about this buy for my daughter's birthday. It was easy enough to put together. But it is also really easy to take it apart. my daughter is artistic. my son is mechanical. She draws on it. He takes it apart. Over and over. He is 3. It shouldn't be THAT easy to take apart!Also a complaint, the chalk board. I hoped to be able to get a lot of use out of it because I can leave the chalk out without worry of having walls/furniture ruined as crayons or markers will do. But no go. It just doesn't work.Threading the paper through the cutter is pointless. I wish I had bought paper pads instead of a big pack of the rolls. I think if I had to do over again, I would have gotten a different easel."
3,Frustrating frustration-free packaging!,"""Frustration-free packaging"" came with no instructions. Frustrating! Probably a mistake to order something which must be removed from original packaging and repackaged...human error becomes a distinct possibility. Chalkboard looks pretty weak, too. Now I dread what else may be missing. Recommend to all you folks: order in original packaging."
2,NOT STRONG OR STURDY,"I bought this for my daughter over a year ago and the legs snapped just under the bins a week after buying it and she hadn't even used it yet. So, now we lean it against the wall and just flip it depending on the side she wants to use. The chalk board is difficult to write on and the knobs keep coming loose on their own so they need constant re-tightening. I wanted a nice looking easel that would last, but I should have bought one of those bright plastic obnoxious versions instead."
4,Excellent,I love this easel it's very cute and as sturdy as they come I bought all the Melissa and Doug extras to go with its very functional
5,BRAVO MACNIFICANT!!!!,THIS IS A GIFT FOR MY 7 YR OLD NEICE AND SHE LOVES IT SHES AMAZING AND SO IS THE SHIPPER. PRODUCT CAME FAST AND BRAND SPANKIN NEW.
3,Melissa and Doug Deluxe Standing Easel,I rated it a five because it is fun to use and very useful when it comes to educating the little ones. I bought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it. My only complaint is that it does not fold up and it is now starting to fall apart and we have only had it since December 2011.
4,Sturdy and functional,Great investment! I love that it has 3 adustable heights so it grows with the child. The large drawing space is wonderful. Easy to assemble and DOES NOT come with paper roll. Somehow I missed this. Only downside is the unfinished wood with some sharp corners.
4,Our 5 year old loves this one,"Encourages her to be on her own - painting, writing. Motivates her to learn to write better."
3,Nice but materials cheap[,"My daughter really enjoys this easel and it serves its purpose, but the wooded legs were warped when we opened the package so it stands a little wobbly. We set it so that you cant really tell; but who wants something brand new out the box to be messed up already! If it were not for that I would have no problems with it."
5,Nice product!,"I am very pleased with this easel I purchased for my 5 year old daughter. The product was super easy to assemble and seems to be quite sturdy. I would definitely recommend it to any parent looking to spark their child's imagination. In addition, make sure to buy the Melissa and Doug Easel Accessory Set. I mistakenly did not - it is not required, but would make the easel complete. (My order has been place for that M & D product!)"
2,Defective... Cracked...,I only WISH I had a better review to type. I love M&D; products but this easel came and I opened the box to find that one of the legs was cracked almost completely in half and the other side of the leg was severly bowed :(I really didn't like the teeny wood legs so I think I will just get a refund and spend a little more $$$ on a sturdier one.
3,For first drawing step is good,"It is good for beginners, weak frame wood and I think that is expensive related to quality and cheap for learning. Maybe other cheaper products offer us better quality."
5,Fun,When I first recieved this I thought it would be a nightmare to put it together. But I was wrong it was very easy and seems to be very sturdy once I got it together. When my daughter got it on Christmas she was very excited and could not wait to ply with it. It has held up good so far.
1,cheap,"this fell apart within a year of usage. I called the company and complained and they seemed helpful and eager to replace it but I never heard from them again when they were supposed to call me back. The screws literally fell out of this and forget about moving it from room to room, it made it worse. I liked to store it in one room and use it in another or outside. If you move it, it will start to fall apart."
5,Works for my 5 year old,"Art Easel? What Easel? Oh yeah... the one that has become such a constant fixture in my kitchen that it seems to be part of the decor.I got this for my daughters 5th b-day. She loves it! Some people have said the chalkboard is crappy and that may be true, but she never uses that side. I loved that it was adjustable. It does take removing hardware to adjust, but we don't have to do it often.I purchased the accessory kit (which I highly recommend) with the paints and extra paper. The paints are bright and thick, the color coded brushes are great and I supplemented the brushes with some smaller ones for finer detail. (the brushes it comes with paint thick lines). Clean up is very easy. Some paint spilled on the wood floor and everything cleans up wonderfully with simple water. The paper roll lasts a LONG time.I'm happy with the investment."
4,Deluxe Standing Easel provides easy access to art!,I leave blank paper and coloring book pages up on this easel for my 3 year old son to color whenever he wants. He's had a lot of fun drawing pictures from the stories that we read to him and coloring them in. This week we drew a crocodile (from Peter Pan) and he filled in the scales. The easel is well-made and takes about an hour to assemble.
4,Great but not so easy to fold away,"This is a great product. My daughter (2.5) loves it. I had read bad reviews concerning the chalkboard, but found out that it works just fine when you use good chalks. The Melissa & Dough chalks are too hard and their colors too dark. When you use normal street chalks, the board is great! One concern, once the trays are in place, the easel doesn't really fold that flat..."
3,This easel is making me crazy!,"I love Melissa and Doug stuff, so choosing this particular easel was a no-brainer. But it has a major flaw in my opinion. It is held together with screws that have bright-colored, easily turnabe little tops on them. So, my very inquisitive three-year-old son is constantly taking it apart. He takes the green ones out, and the tray that holds the paint falls. He takes the yellow ones off and the red ones off, and the thing literally collapses! I am so tired of coming into the kitchen and finding it half assembled! And it makes me mad at him. But frankly, the way it's made, it's just begging for little hands to turn those bright colored plastic tops! Boo, Melissa and Doug!"
3,Overpriced,"I am a preschool teacher and was thrilled to receive this as a gift for the classroom. Many people have mentioned trouble with the chalkboard. I did not experience this. Here are some pros and cons:Pros1. adjustable height, we keep it on the lowest setting and all my kids can reach the top2. 2 kids can use it at once3. nice paint trays that can be removed for washingCons1. Poor quality, warping after 2 months of use2. Kids can easily unscrew knobs. Had to superglue them on (except the paint tray ones)Overall it is ok, although I think it is way overpriced for the poor quality."
4,Wish the dry erase board was magnetic,"I like the easel, and found it fairly easy to put together, but am disappointed that the dry erase board is not magnetic. Some of the other reviews suggest that it used to be. It would be great to bring this feature back and it would make the easel much more useful and fun."
4,"Big, but my 2 year old uses it every day","Got this for her majoy Christmas present, the token item I hoped she would use daily and for a long time. So far, so good. She loves it. We only use the chalk side and pull paper over the dry erase, those makers in the hands of a 2 year old were just too terrifying. I filled the paint cups with crayons for now. This thing is HUGE, takes up a lot of space in our small apartment but I think it is worth it. The large surface area of the paper has allowed her to start writing letters which she wasn't previously able to do on smaller paper."
4,Our kids love it,"It has almost everything. It is a good height and durable, and adjustable. It is quite stable and the paper roll is a great idea. Only two small things would make it perfect. One is that the wooden paper cutter is difficult for even an adult to use. It cuts well enough but the fit is so tight and the margin of paper left so small that you end up re threading the paper every time, which is not easy. So even the older kid needs help when the painting is finished. The other thing I would have liked is for the white board to be magnetic, but after a lot of research I gave up on this feature to get an easel with good reviews otherwise."
5,Melissa and Doug products are the best!!,"This is a very well constructed art product and is something that will grow up with my grandchild as she matures. I love the fact that it can fold down and take less room and is made to adjust to the height of the child. This is a great purchase for any child who likes to draw, paint and explore their creativity. I have compared it to other easels and found it to be one of the best on the market."
2,Melissa and *Shrug*,"Pretty disappointed with this product. It was mostly easy to put together, but the actual construction of the parts is poor. Two of the four legs are warped and every hole drilled in it is splintered and cheap looking and slightly off in spacing requiring a decent bit of muscle to make sure the boards line up. The edges of each piece of wood are incredibly sharp, too. I had to sand the corners down so they didn't continue to slice my hand as I put the thing together and for the safety of my son handling the thing. It will definitely get the job done as an easel, but I am disappointed in the quality of its construction for the cost. Melissa and Doug is usually better than this."
5,Fantastic price for a well-made and sturdy easel,"This easel is well-made, sturdy, and has all the features-- including a fantastic price.Highlights:1) Great design and colorful2) Easy to assemble-- the easel will take about 30-40 minutes to put together from start to finish.3) Versatile- one side has a large chalkboard and the other is a whiteboard. You can also adjust the height to fit your child's age.4) Includes perfectly sized trays for both sides5) Well made and very sturdy. We have an energetic toddler and the easel still looks great and is steady6) SIMPLE clean up-- all the major pieces are held with large colorful knobs, which means you can easily take out trays for washing. HUGE help!You will be happy with this purchase-- just be sure to buy separate easel paper and paints/brushes as they are not included."
3,"Wouldn't call it ""deluxe"".","I bought this easel as a Birthday gift for my 3 year old Grandaughter. It was put together pretty simply...which is a plus. Comes with no extras, paper, paints etc. Which is cleary stated in it's description. I have an easel at my own home which all my Grandkids use and love. It is what I consider deluxe. The Doug & Melissa easel is ""cute"" and matches her playroom in their basement. I think my biggest disappointment is that the dry erase side isn't magnetic. And that this easel is pretty lightweight and a bit chintzy. Not what I would call ""deluxe""."
5,easel,My grandaughter age 19 months loves the easel. Plays with it everyday since she received it. Enjoys the paper and crayons.
4,Love the easel,"I bought the easel for my son's 4th birthday. It looks great in his big bedroom, we draw every day pretty much for about 30 min. We bought the roll of paper, added all his markers, crayons, chalks. The assembly was easy since I did not hear my husband complain about it, it is a very nice wood easel, nice colors. It can be a little tricky to change the sheet of paper, he needs assistance. I just need to buy erasable markers now so we can use the white board. I have bought many toys from Melissa & Doug and I have never been disappointed. Would recommend this easel for all the kids that love drawing and painting."
4,Great Product!,Great product! Kids love it and it is very versatile and well built. My only complaint is that for toddlers it is too easy for them to turn the knobs and take it apart and loose the pieces. Over all I am very happy and it is a super value and great toy for kids.
4,Nice,My 3 year old really likes this. It is great to have. The only bad thing is the chalk board. The board is not very good. I used some very fine sand paper to ruff up the chalk board so the chalk would write better on the surface.
5,great easel,"my niece is an ""artist"" she loves to draw and paint and color so she has really enjoyed this stand, very sturdy"
5,Great easel,"I was going to make an easel for the grandkids, but when I saw this one, it was exactly what I had in mind and then some. And for the price I couldn't pass it up."
5,super hit!,"I have purchased several of these over the years..my daughter got one years ago and will not get rid of it, even though, she is in her teens..she still loves drawing on it and leaving hints about things on it..she wants to keep it forever, I guess..This is a way to let kids learn, color, numbers, drawing, just about everything..doing it by hand and it is so much more appreciated than on a computer game. kids are losing out and need to actually touch things and be involved..they all love it, no matter the age.."
5,Great for more than one child,"Our two girls don't have to fight over whose turn it is to paint, because the clips allow easel paper to be placed on both sides. The adjustable height is genius, so that everything starts at eye level and can be raised as the girls grow. Assembly takes a little time but is not difficult."
4,"So far, so good","The chalkboard works great for me, as does the dry erase. This thing is very sturdy. I recommend it for the kids!"
1,Piece of junk!!!,"I ordered this easel with grant money I had recieved for my special education classroom. I share a room with 2 other teachers, and really wanted my own white board. Well, I have had it for 3 weeks, and it is already so wobbly and I am constantly having to put the screws back in! I have had several people look at it to make sure I just didn't put it together wrong, but they all said it was right. I am so disappointed, I wish I wouldn't have wasted my grant money on this! Also, the white board isn't that easy to erase like most white boards. You have to run an eraser over the marker 5-6 times before it will erase completely off."
2,"Horrible ""chalkboard""","I love almost everything about this except the actual chalkboard, which really isn't a chalkboard. I'm thinking they must have changed it to save money. It's horrible. Can't even draw on it. It's like have a really old, worn chalkboard. Very disappointed. Now I'm going to have to spend money to buy chalkboard paint."
5,awesome,this was a great purchase my daughter LOOVE it and O love amazon thank thank thank thank thank thank you
3,"Nice design, questionable quality","Nice easel, but it's made from wood that's about half a step up from balsa in durability. Assembly was pretty straightforward, but nothing is preassembled so there are a lot of parts to deal with. Mechanically disinclined people might consider getting something that's already assembled."
3,Price Hike,"Wow, they just jacked the price from $43.99 to $79.99 today. I was just about to buy this. Not anymore. Crazy price hike, I wonder why. Is it discontinued or something?"
4,Love this easel!,"Overall I LOVE this easel. It is great that the height of the dry erase board and chalk boards can change with the height of my children. I like the trays available for whatever they decide to use. The only thing that I would change would be the actual frame is just plain wood, which I will take apart this summer and paint to give more color and sand down so the kids do not get splinters. Wish there were more stores that sold the accessories close by."
5,A nice well built easel.,I bought this for my grandson and he and his father had a good time putting it together. It went together very easily and has held up well under the rigors of use by young boy from the ages of 3-6 years old. Very well built and it gives your kid somewhere to draw that is not the walls of your home.
4,Great Product,"This easel is a good purchase. It has held up well and the kids enjoy using it. They especially enjoy the dry erase board. If you have aspiring artists in your house then this is perfect for them. It is sturdy, easy to assemble and does not take up too much space. I am glad I purchased it. Two kids and a two sided easel are perfect...no fights!"
5,Perfect for my budding artists,"This was pretty easy to set up for my husband. It looks durable and won't fall over easily. The chalkboard looks questionable as to whether or not the chalk will easily show up or not. Otherwise, this is a great item for my children."
4,Fun for kids but can be improved,"This is a real good item for kids, mine had fun with it for a while until it fell on my girl the other day when my boy bearly touched it as he was walking by his sister. My son likes it a lot because it gives him a flaver of school, in which he's very much looking forward to. Overall I gave it a 4 start rating but if they can make the stand more stable, it's definitely a 5 start item. We will continue to use it and be more careful with it."
5,Excellent product,solid wood very durable my 7 year old daughter has not stopped playing with since Easter. Only thing I recommend is to buy the kit with it. I had to run out and buy the paper chalk easer markers paints and brush and spent a lot more than if I had buy the kit
2,Great Easel BUT...............,"I love the size of this. It's easy to adjust. I have 4 children playing with it ages 10, 7, 5, & 3.BUT......... The chalk board really won't let you chalk easily and the dry erase board is staining.... No matter what brand I use...Frustrating for me and the kids.I'm going to contact the company and also do what another reviewer suggested; buy the chalk board paint to make it better...."
4,searcher,"This was something we needed for our daycare the kids love it and with the roll of paper for painting it makes it even more entertaining. I purchased the accessories seperate, the paint cups and brushes and chalk. The chalk board can be messy but at least it has a lip below to catch all the excess. It took some figuring out to put together and it does take up some room when it is open, but it can also be closed so that helps. Overall good purchase."
3,MIssing Hardware,"I ordered this for my 9 year old daughter, she is my little artist. I did not check the package when it arrived. On Christmas Eve Dad and I were very disappointed to find that 26 pieces of the much needed hardware were missing for assembly. Fortunately Dad was able to find replacement hardware for the 26 missing plastic wingnuts and screws that were missing. On Christmas morning our girl was very excited to see her easel and has enjoyed drawing and writing on her easel."
5,well worth the money,"I bought this easel for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it and so do I ... it was worth every penny spent on it ... it is durable, very nice size and was easy to assemble. I had read other reviews before buying it and I noticed several people had dislikes about the chalkboard. We have not had one issue with the chalkboard side, she and I have both wrote on it and it is perfect!! No complaints from me on this purchase.....we all love it :)"
5,Love it,This christmas My husband and i bought our 2 1/2 yr old son this easel. he absolutly loves it! we didn't have to prime any of the boards and we haven't had any problem with scrating or staining. He uses sidewalk chalk and a dry erase and chalk eraser. We bought the markers at walmart with a cleaning solution for the white board. My 1 yr old daughter likes to pull herself up on the trays and the legs. We love how sturdy it is. we havn't bought the paper for it yet and probably won't for sometime. this was a great buy! The price was lower on this easel then alot of the plastic and not as sturdy wooden ones. We have alot of melissa and doug toys and we rate them all very high.
5,Great!,"Santa gave this Easel to my 6 year old daughter three days ago. I absolutely love this Easel.I was amazed at the it's durability as I was putting it together. When combined with the Starter set, it became the gift that keeps on giving. I have enjoyed many hours of peace and quiet, and my daughter may become the next Frieda Kahlo."
3,"Good product, good fit but expensive for what it is.",This is a fine product but it is over-priced. We've had it for about two years and have had no problems with it.
4,Easel,I think this is a great product...my child loves it. It's very durable and most importantly - it was easy to assemble!
4,"Great product, inflated price","This is a good looking easel which any 3+ year old would love. My daughter loves writing on the chalkboard and painting. But for me, at $45, it felt like a ripoff because a similar item is at Ikea for $15. Yes, a friend owns it and yes it is just as stable after a year of use. After buying paper roll and chalk and paint box, it still comes to less than $30. I guess we paid the premium for the brand name. Humpf!"
5,"Sturdy, practical, very pleased","I was impressed with how well-made this easel is; it's a good deal for the price. 2 children (eg 5 and 3) can use it at the same time, and it is easy to carry from room to room and is not shaky or easily tipped over. It folds in half and though it's not compact, it can be placed into a large closet or the corner of a room. The trays are nice for holding paints or markers or crayons; the roll of M & D paper is thin but easy to use in the easel. Would buy again."
5,Easel,This is a very nice sturdy easel and is fairly easy to assemble even for an essembly challenged person like myself. My 5 year old grandaughter was thrilled with it.
4,Good Buy,"We bought the easel for my 3 year old. He loves the chalk board, and has really enjoyed using the other side with a of roll craft paper & markers. The item was a bit tricky to assemble, but the instructions are adequate. Overall, it was a good buy and we're pleased with it."
5,Melissa & Doug Is A Company That I Trust,"Their products are well-made, non-toxic, and fairly priced. This is a very nice easel and my kids love it. One side you have a dry erase, the other side a chalkboard, and you can buy a roll of paper for drawing and painting."
3,could be better. its a sturdy set.,"screw holes were not aligned. had a hard time assembling it.kid - 6 yr old , just loves it.overall satisfied"
2,Did NOT last foe the price.,"I have a child who loved this easel, and played with it every day just about. she is gentle as a 2.5yr old can be, and now she is about to turn four and im searching for a NEW easel because this one has absolutely fallen apart. the yellow/green/blue knobs have all cracked and broken off, the wood mid pieces where the paper roll was to sit have both broken off.. i mean, this did not hold up AT ALL. the most movement it got was transporting from bedroom to living room. i feel like for the price, i should have gotten much more than a year and a half of heavy use out of this.also, after a few months, the white board stopped erasing completely and the chalkboard takes a wash down with a wet rag between uses as well, the eraser is useless.I expected more from melissa and doug and now i'm unsure where to look for something higher quality -- anyone with helpful tips please let me know"
3,Deluxe Standing Easel,"This is a very nice easel. The dry erase board is nice, but does stain if something written is left a while. The paper holder is a good design and is the part we use most. The chalkboard is not quite what I expected. It is difficult to draw on and doesn't thoroughly erase. For the sale price I paid it was a GREAT value. Had I paid full price I would have been disappointed. All in all it is not a bad product, if your looking mostly for a blackboard type chalkboard this is not the easel for you."
4,The same for less,"A friend purshased this product and was very happy with it. However, we have owned a very similar one from IKEA for two years for half the price. Our IKEA product gets put outside on nice days and has been pretty beaten up, but is still in good shape and very sturdy. If you can't get to an IKEA, the Melissa and Doug product is an excellent choice."
3,Good Vehicle for the expressive child,"I purchased this easel as a 2008 Xmas present for my 9 year old sister, who enjoys painting and drawing. She loved it, and took to drawing immediately. I opted not to purchase the paint kit and other accessories. (Didn't want my dad to have to worry about paint in the carpet) I went to Staples/Office Depot and purchased extra drawing pads (for half the online price), a nice chalk package, and a large set of expo markers. So far no complaints. In fact, my niece saw it and begged for one for her birthday. In summary, so long as you stay away from the paint, it's a nice easel, relatively simple to put together, which could provide enjoyment for your expressive/creative child."
4,Good gift for the growing artist,"I bought this for my 7 year old daughter who loves to play school. She is really enjoying her gift. It is well made and was not that difficult to put together. I like it because the height is adjustable and we could make it be at just the right level for her to write and draw. The only down fall, if you could call it that, is the chalkboard side. It has a high gloss on it that makes the chalk I bought difficult to see. My daughter really has to push hard with the chalk to get it to write the way she wants it to. Since she is pushing so hard she keeps breaking the chalk. I think I need to order the Melissa and Doug chalk that I have seen on line as well, that probably works better."
5,A Great Easel!,My son received this easel for his 2nd birthday and he LOVES it - especially the chalkboard side (which works very well).The easel is very well constructed out of quality materials like all of the Melissa and Doug products we have purchased to date.We also have the Easel Companion Set that is made to compliment this easel and all the products in it are high quality.I would highly recommend this easel to others.
5,Standing Easel,"After arrival of the easel, my husband opened it up and checked the wood for stability. At this time we will rate a 5 star, may have to me changes after Christmas. Our 5yr old Artist begins her work on projects as she calls them."
5,Hours of Messy Fun,Will be her best Christmas ever. Can't wait to see my daughter's face light up with joy at the thought of having a space to paint and be messy.
2,Terrible Chalkboard Great Whiteboard,"My daughter loves the whiteboard side of this easel, the trays are perfect for holding erasers, markers, and chalk. The easel seems fairly sturdy and easy to assemble. I was extremely disapointed with the poor quality of the chalkboard side. The chalk has never marked properly on the chalkboard, the board surface seems very slippery and leaves only a faint chalk impression. We followed the instructions for prepping and cleaning the chalkboard but it didn't make any difference."
5,"Great Product, Great Price!","This easel is a great buy! Very sturdy and high quality as most of mellisa and doug products. Colorful, kid friendly and easy to put together. Both the writing boards and the trays are adjustable for the height of your child. It folds up easy, but stands strong. This easel DOES have a place for a paper roll!! I did not think it did by the amazon description (I almost bought a more expensive one for the paper roll but decided to go with this and am so glad I did) ... the roll goes in the center between the boards and the paper comes up through the top and under a paper guide in front of the dry erase side. I can't image why you would spend more on another brand of easel, this one has everything I could think of wanting and is simple, solid wood, looks good and is super functional. This is the first review I have written, but wanted to pass on how happy I am with this product."
5,Perfect easel for perfect price!,"My mom bought this for my little girl for her 2nd birthday.(they had it in our local Toys R Us store, although it now says it is only available online) It was not my first choice, but I am super glad we decided to go with this one! Although bought for the 2 year old, my 9 year old and her friends all love it too! SO, I guess you will get your money's worth! Assembly was not too bad, and the product is very sturdy! I am very very happy with this purchase! Not to mention, the price was wonderful compared to other similar items!"
3,M and D Will Replace Defective Chalkboard for Free,"Like many others, I was dismayed to find that the chalkboard scratches very easily. I bought mine in 11/06, and had hoped that the problem had been corrected. I called Melissa and Doug's customer service. They know there are problem chalkboards out there and offered to ship me a new chalkboard free of charge. It arrived and works great. Also, I was surprised to see that the wood on the easel was unfinished and had several red and green marks on it from shipping. We sanded the wood down and put a clear coat of polyurethene (sp?) on it and now paint/markers, etc clean off of it easily and it looks gorgeous. We love this easel! I originally gave this 3 stars, but that was before the new chalkboard arrived. I'd give this product 4 stars now."
4,Great for 3+ Years old,"My daughter received this for her third birthday. She loves it. I would have to agree with another insert that the chalkboard does not work so well. The dry erase, however is wonderful! I cannot wait to get the paper so that she can start painting next!I would recommend this to three and above. There are some small pieces and the height could pose an issue for smaller children. But overall, GREAT Product!Only downfall, is the they do not provide even a few sheets of paper to get you started and chalk/eraser etc."
1,Whiteboard from hell!,"We wrote ""Happy Birthday"" on the whiteboard the morning of our daughter's birthday. I used an Expo dry erase marker. I'm a teacher and I use these in my classroom as well. Went to erase the message the next day and you would think I used a permanent marker!!! I am very disappointed in the quality for the money we spent on this. I have used Expo wipes and the spray and I am putting some serious elbow grease into cleaning this board. We have bought small lap-size white boards that were better quality. I hate when I put my time, thought, and money into a crappy product."
2,Not very durable,"Looks nice, but my kids enjoy unscrewing the colorful knobs, which are needed to keep this standing. I've replaced most of the knobs with nuts & lockwashers & tightened so that they can no longer remove. This makes cleaning the paint tray difficult. Also, the swing bars could be helpful if you were going to collapse this all the time & lean up against a wall. We don't need to do this. The kids like to lift the bars & walk between the panels. But lifting the bar makes it unstable & it can fall on the children. Lastly, we had cracks in the wood along some of the screw holes & eventually returned it.In conclusion, it LOOKS nice, but isn't durable or safe enough for our household."
4,Budding artists rejoice!,"I recently purchased this for my son's 3 year old birthday. He loves to draw and paint, so this gift was a real winner. The only drawback, which resounds with other reviewers is the chalkboard side. Thanks to previous reviews and suggestions, I knew to repaint the chalkboard side with chalkboard paint. This is not a difficult process, but a bit time consuming for the busy mom. Thankfully, the chalkboard piece slides out of the wooden frame, so there was no taping or difficulty painting it. It is now a perfect chalkboard! Barring this issue (which led me to only give 4 stars), it's a great product. The fact that it has two sides, makes it great for my 5 year old to play along, with minimal arguing."
3,Disappointing,"We are huge Melissa and Doug fans in my house, so when I saw this easel for such a great price I was excited. I just got it today and wanted to put it together and have to say how very disappointed I am. First it looks cheap, not the usual Melissa and Doug standard. Second it has taken forever to put together and some of the holes aren't lining up with each other which is very frustrating. I would probably purchase this again because of the price, but really have not loved it so far."
2,SO SAD!!,"I like the other costumer should of followed my gut. My husband and I are very upset as we are putting the easel together for our son for Christmas morning, the quality is bad. The wood is not even smooth!!! The chalk board has a wax finish and you can not erase the chalk all the way off. It is sickening to me that you can't find company's anymore that put a 100% into their products. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A MELLISSA AND DOUG PRODUCT AGAIN!!!! Please don't waste your money!!!"
4,Perfect Christmas Present,"My daughter received the easel for Christmas and loves it! It was a present from Santa for my 5 year old but my 2 1/2 year old loves it just as much. Plenty of room for both of them to create at the same time. Height adjusts, lots of space in the tray for crayons, chalk and dry-erase markers. Folds up for storage if needed and was easy/quick to assemble."
4,Totally awesome,This is awesome my little girl has not stopped playing with it since christmas. The only drwback is that the paper roll did not come with it like the description show it was supposed too.
4,Melissa and Doug Deluxe Standing Easel,"Our 2 1/2-year-old loves this easel! It is the perfect size and very durable. I think we will get years of use out of this item, and the price on Amazon was unbeatable. [...]"
2,sad,"I odrer this for my granddaughter and by the discription given, i thought it would include the paint and paper...when it was delivered, the box was really torn up so i retaped it and wrapped it. On Christmas morning, we opened the easel and found there was no paint, no paper, no crayons, no nothing. I am very disappointed with this product as far as the description goes. if you have to order the supplies it should tell you that. For me, with accessories means just that. I will not buy from this buyer again."
4,Painting and Drawing,"Bought for Grand Daughter, who loves to draw and paint. She is have a good time and not making such a mess as before when she was working on the table."
4,Great gift,Great gift for my 5 year old son. The only problem is the water and paint are splashing to the floor through the whole and we had to add some plastic to prevent that.
1,This rotts,Their are pieces missing package was half opened when I got it . this was for christmas this made me sick and i dont have money to return it. Horrifying
5,M&D Easel Stand,Great product and the kids love the roll of paper they can keep pulling to keep creating and that the paint is in cups right at their finger tips. I love the fact that the lids on the paint set bought separately makes this the perfect and completes the set. A real must have for a family with a artist!!
4,Typical for Melissa and Doug...great product...but,"This item is pretty much: what you see is what you get. It's a great quality toy that my husband put together in about 15 minutes. It's pretty sturdy and we are very happy with it, as are our kids. Although I think mine was supposed to come with a roll of paper and didn't. Anyway, it's a good buy, which can be expected with pretty much any Melissa and Doug toy.Since I have owned this easel, I have found a couple of flaws. The screws are cute and colorful, but easy to turn and all three of my kids have gone through phases where they unscrew most of them and the thing graduatlly falls apart. Another problem is that it doesn't collapse easily. It would be great if would at least fold flat so that you could lean it against the wall...It takes up a lot of space."
4,This is great but a little pricey,"This is a great easel. And it's built pretty well and it's super easy to put together. Only thing I don't like is the fact that the little knobs are super easy to ""undo"" by my toddler. She loves to take things apart. The easel is not a good thing take apart. Glad I bought this but M&D stuff is a little overpriced."
3,Tips for complants,"I have read in the reviews that people had trouble with the surfaces. New chalk boards need to be prepped, so using light sand paper go at it in all directions and patterns. Next color in the whole board using the side of the chalk, and rub with soft cloth, then erase. I did this before assembling. For the dry erase side always wax first, I used past furniture wax, pledge might do the trick and car wax is probably the best.It's fine great. I was an art teacher so this is usually what you have to do."
3,Easel didn't make the 5 star cut.,This easel for the price is a little flimsy. The wood pieces are not very thick. I ordered this online only to find thick plastic easels in the store that I think would have lasted longer than this is going to.
5,Great Easel,"We got this easel as a gift for my 3 year old. It is very study and durable. Great that there is the chalkboard and painting/whiteboard side. We got the art set (necessary match) and it is was immediately ready to go! She loves painting and using the chalkboard. The height of the boards are adjustable, so it can grow with her and it comes with some cute colorful clips to hold the paper down. The chalkboard wipes off easily, nice and smooth, not like the old chalky ones! This is a great gift to get your child to draw/paint."
5,wonderful for little ones,I bought this for my 2 1/2 yr old and he loves it. easy to put together and they seem to have corrected what must have been earlier issues (based on the reviews here) with the chalkboard because it works just fine. No conditioning needed. I do recommend the crayoned dry/erase crayons rather than markers but this is a fabulous deal and a fine toy.
4,Great Easel PAPER @ IKEA,"Very nice easel, the little ones really enjoy it.For those having issues finding the paper, IKEA has it for $5 a roll and it fits PERFECT"
3,Half good half bad,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she uses it everyday. It's very sturdy and I love the way it looks. The only complaint I have is with the chalkboard. It doesn't work well at all. We bought the accessory set that was recommended to go with this and it came with the chalk. It barely shows up and the chalkboard itself seems as though there's a gloss on it that prevents the chalk from working well. Overall, it's a great product for painting and using the whiteboard but the chalkboard is useless."
2,disappointment....buy elsewhere,"With its bright colors, trays and adjustable height, this easel is very alluring. In actuality, though, it is a lot of flash and little substance. As others have mentioned, the chalkboard does not work, despite the prep work instructed. My 3 year old handed me a piece of chalk and said, ""Mommy, can you make this work?"" Also, no one has mentioned this but the dry erase board does not wipe off cleanly. We have tried several kinds of dry erase markers and I still end up using a bleach solution to clean it. Not very convenient. My parents bought this for my sons and their money would have been better spent elsewhere. I know that I have purchased easels at IKEA with similar features, a better chalkboard and a lower price. It seems like Melissa and Doug's quality has been slipping in recent years. It's a shame."
3,Standing Easel,"Overall a nice easel however, the chalkboard side is NOT impressive. Chalk barely shows up on the board. We have yet to call Melissa and Doug for any suggestions to somehow prime the chalkboard side so it will work properly. It would also be nice if it were designed in a way to make it easier to adjust the height. Overall, we bought the easel for an affordable price and our children are enjoying the whiteboard side."
5,Encourages Creativity,Easy to assemble. Sturdy. My five year old granddaughter loved it. Now I receive paintings from her in the mail. There will be other supplies you will want to purchase - Paints (of course) and a roll of easel paper; maybe some colored chalk and dry erase markers.
5,Provides hours of creative fun!,"Purchased this for my granddaughter for christmas and it arrived quickly and on time. It was east to put together. It is great becasue the height of the board is adjustable. The lowest level was for perfect for her, so there is growing room. Don't miss the center piece for a roll of continuous art paper. It is great! It does not come with paint and I did not get the matching M&D; paint set. I should have because by the time I bought it myself it was the same amount of money!As usual, the Melissa And Doug items are always so well built and thought out. I even had fun with it. With two sides her littel brother can paint and doodle as well."
3,Not up to Melissa & Doug's high standards,"We have many Melissa & Doug's wooden products: puzzles, castles, stoves etc. and yet this one does not seem to be made with the same quality of wood. We found it to be a bit flimsy compared to our previous art easel. I am a big fan of the Melissa and Doug productsbut this is the first one I found disappointing."
4,Good product but shipped damaged,"My 5 year old son was excited to try out his easel, but I found broken pieces when I began the assembly. One of the braces had the end snapped off (the missing end was not in the box), and the white board was cracked in the one corner. I immediately called ""Melissa and Doug"" and was offered replacement parts, however, it has been over a week and no sign of the parts. Overall, it looks like the easel will be durable when put together, but I am disappointed in how it was shipped and how long it is taking to receive the new parts. Unfortunately, my son is no longer expressing any interest in the easel. Hopefully this will change when it is put together."
4,Sturdy for the price,"Sturdy for the price. Some of the screws stripped when I had to take them off and put them on again! Downfall, it does not come with paper roll!"
4,kids easel,this easel is easy to put together and is super sturdy. my daughter loves it and is always drawing on it instead of the walls and other stuff that she is not supposed to.
5,Great product,"This is a great product, and it made a wonderful gift for my daughter. She absolutely loves it."
4,Happy customer,"We just got it, bu so far my 4 years old daughter loves it so do I,it seems good quality the only think is that I wish it would come with paint cups,paint brushes, dry markers or chuck, but anyway so far we like it."
5,WONDER BOARD FOR YOUR BABY !!,"THIS DRAWING BOARD IS VERY USEFUL FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER...DRWING,WRITING ...WHAT EVER SHE FEELS...IT IS WONDERFULL."
5,Good investment for years and if you have more than one kid,"Our kids (2 and 3 years old) got these easel on christmas 2005. Since them they love to paint every day and there is no trouble because they can use both sides, so there is one painting area for each kid. There is also plenty of room to hold all their different pencils and crayons. We put the easel in our livingroom because it looks really nice - not like all these plastic stuff. After a year, all things considered, it was a very good investment."
1,What a worthless product,"I bought this for my four year old niece as a Christmas present. It took a bit more effort than I anticipated to put it together and it was not readily apparent what was in store for me until I got to the tail end. There are a multitude of holes drilled into the easel legs for the assembly and one of the holes nearest the hinges was about a half inch lower than the other leg. As such, it was impossible to get the chalkboard put on correctly and I had to return the item. I'm writing this on Christmas Eve and am so p.o.'d now because I basically wasted over an hour on a gift I won't be able to give. What a worthless product!!!! Stay away."
5,Entertaining and educational,"I researched this easel before I purchased it for my Grandson. It is very well made & height adjustable. The chalk board works very well, as I had read that some boards are hard to write on. Excellent product. Just remember to order the easel paper and supplies."
5,years of fun,My 3 and 4 year old used this almost everyday for a few years. Now I get it out for my two year old and they still want to use it. It has four cup holders for paint cups to be placed in and the oppostie side has a chalk board so more than one kid can use it at a time. Also when the girls were 5 and 6 they would paint pictures together or in groups with their friends on playdates. It has held up to all the use really well!
1,Lousy quality,"Had this toy for 2 years. Then this fell apart. The wood dowel that holds the paper roll broke within the first week, the wing nut plastic caps broke within the first year. Last month, or the second year, the dry erase board started bubbling and detaching from the backing. Then the chalk board tray broke off from brittle plastic. This started out fun for kids, but then they lost interest very quickly. There is only so much painting or drawing a kid can do before being bored. But, we thought we would keep the art going and bought the Melissa & Doug Table Top Easel to replace this standing floor easel. The table top easel arrived factory sealed, with deformed and broken parts. The wood was cheap quality, as with the standing floor easel. We are through with Melissa and Doug. Bad, cheap products."
2,There has to be better,"I notice this product gets good reviews, but I have to think there are better options. The plain wood frame shows every mark and doesn't wipe clean. Beware of the Melissa and Doug paints. My son spilled one on the carpet because the lids that come with the paint containers do not fit well at all. The paint never came out of the carpet even though we spent hours working on it immediately after the spill. To be honest, after having this, I don't even consider buying a Melissa and Doug product anymore."
1,Sub-standard product,I was reading the reviews and sub-reviews for this product and will not be buying it. I did find a great Web site to a company that makes all products for children in the USA [...]. This easel looks like great quality and they have a lot of other products that look equal in quality and also lok like a lot of fun. I plan on purchasing it.
3,"Problems with the ""GIFT"" option","I had a problem with the gift option because I had selected the gift wrap but, it didn't come with it.Please, I want a explanation.Best Regards."
3,Not for Children Younger Than 4,Not for toddlers! This product has very small parts. My husband and I purchased this easel for your son who was 2 1/2 at the time. He was able to take apart the easel easily and left the parts on the floor to be picked up and put in the mouth of my infant. Please keep this in mind if purchasing the product.
4,Not exactly as adveritsed,"The only problem with this easel blackboard/drawing board is that it wasn't as complete as it said in the description: it didn't come with paint or PAPER roll after it stated that it came with ""everything"" to allow your child to become an artist. When I hunted for the enumeration of what it offered, I couldn't find a breakdown of exactly what was included and what wasn't.The construction seems to be sturdy and my grandson enjoys the blackboard and whiteboard."
3,Helpful Tool for the Classroom,"The easel was a great addition to my 1st grade classroom. The children made full use of it - especially the marker side (the other side is for chalk). It was the perfect height for them and it has good compartments for keeping the markers and chalk. Being adjustable, I could use it easily too without hurting my back. The only downside was that it was a bit difficult to put together (but that is why we have husbands). After it is put together, you should be careful moving it as it is not the most durable and pieces can break off. However, three years later we are still using it effectively in the house."
4,Cute,"I've been keeping my eye on this easel for a year now, and just decided to get this for my 3 year old's birthday (but I have a 4 year old who would enjoy it too..) They've enjoyed both sides, and I purchased the paper from Border's and cups separately. The black board doesn't write clearly with chalk, but maybe that's because I have Crayola chalk and not M and D's chalk?? Putting it together was ok, but my husband and I were running out of steam and were tired, thus making mistakes. It's a little flimsy, but it's nice. I hope to use this for a while, and with the adjustable trays and boards, should last a while. $45 was worth the price. I think it was much higher last year...and you can store it, so that'll be helpful!!"
4,Great easel for the price!,My wife did lots of research and came down to this easel and one sold at Ikea. Both were affordable and seemed stable. We chose the one sold at Amazon for convenience. My son loves the easel and uses it for painting and drawing. It is quite stable and comes with clips that are useful. I knocked off a star because the assembly was a little more difficult than you would imagine.
5,Love this easel,"Our daughter, age 5, loves to draw and write. The only thing she wanted for Christmas was a ""paint board"" like they have at school. I did a lot of research on different art easels and found this one to be most like what I was looking for and it had the best reviews. I ordered it online 1 week before Christmas and it arrived in plenty of time to have it set up and ready for Christmas morning. I also got a great price from Amazon with free shipping, making it cheaper than any comparable easel I'd seen and even cheaper than many lesser quality easels. Our daughter was so excited when she came down the stairs Christmas morning and saw her ""paint board"" from Santa. She has gotten so much use out of it already and I know it will be a favorite for years to come. It was a great buy for our family!"
3,Warped Leg!,"We received this easel as a gift for our daughter, and upon opening the box and realizing there are about 26 screws to deal with, one of the easel's legs is warped. What a disappointment. I wrote directly to Melissa and Doug and hope this situation can be quickly remedied so that my daughter can use her easel. It looks like it would be fun."
3,Hoping for better,"I got this to help with homeschooling next year. I have used it a little with my oldest in doing math. When it arrived, the chalkboard piece had stuff on it that made a section of it not usable. M & D replaced it with no problems. I have been disappointed with the quality of M & D larger products as this is the 3rd product that I have bought in the last year that has had to have some of it replaced. The white board seems to not erase totally and this is using a M & D white board marker. I gave it the rating I did because the children still enjoy it and the chalkboard side is fine. I would definitely not pay full price for this though."
5,Nice Product!,Easy to assemble. This keep both my 4 yr old & 9 yr old busy. It can be adjusted according to the child's height. The price is very reasonable. Good product.
5,My 6 year old loves it!,Very durable; well worth the money; chalkboard side works great..didn't have to apply chalkboard paint to it; checked into many other brands..glad I chose this one:)KCIL
4,Easel,"The Grand kids love it, both can paint or draw at the same time one on each side. Also There are many products made for the easel."
2,Disappointing - would not buy again,"I recently purchased our 4thMelissa & Doug Deluxe Standing Easeland accessory set of paint, chalk, paper,etc.The chalk board surface does not take the chalk. Both the chalk board and white board are dented on the same edge. The box it arrived in was not, so probably shipped that way.We had to make a modification in one of the pre-drilled holes to assemble it.I was really disappointed this time and will not buy again. For the money, the quality has really gone down."
4,2 year old loves it,"Bought this for our 2 year old daughters birthday, and she couldn't be happier with it. It's adjustable height is great so it will be useful for many years to come. It was very easy to setup and it seems very sturdy.The only downside is that the chalkboard is not magnetic."
4,Well worth the price. Why spend more?,"I purchased this for my daughters (5 & 2 yrs old) for the cold winter months. I let them use washable markers on both sides, and then they clean it off with a wet paper towel, sponge or wipey. It's a great place for them to spend time being creative!"
4,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Standing Easel,"It's really a good toy with a few minor problems. My kids really do love it and my 4 year old has started writing her ABC's since she got it. The problems are: hard to assemble and the chalk board is pure cr*p. Don't expect to be able to use chalk board even after you do the break-in procedure. I ended up buy a can of chalk-board paint and repainting the chalk board part. It's a lot better now, but too darn bad I had to go through all of that in the first place. The dry-erase board is fine and the plastic cups are great to hold all the chalk, markers and erasers. (None of that comes with the board, you have to purchase all of that separately.)My husband finally got it put together after some cussing, but now it's a great toy and was not very expensive. Seems sturdy enough and has adjustable height levels which will keep it usable as your kids grow taller. My 4 and 6 year olds almost get into fights over who gets to use what side of it so it is a hit with kids."
3,chalkboard,i love the easel. but does anybody else have the same problem i have? the chalkboard isn't very good. everytime my little boy tries to write on the chalkboard it doesn't show up very well. i primed it like the directions said but it doesn't matter. the chalk still doesn't show up very well. it is very frustrating...any suggestions?
3,chalkboard not functional,"not sure why the chalkboard does not work and this high quality ""melissa & doug"" brand. a couple of other feedbacks note the same problem. my daughter loves to draw with chalk so we are really bummed that only half of the easel is useful. we primed it just as the instructions state but no luck there."
2,Great Concept but VERY CHEAPLY made,"I was so excited for this easel to come and so disappointed by it. When it arrived the cheap plastic trays had already split and broken - we could only install one of them. All of the plastic clips, which are supposed to hold paper, but do not do so effectively, have been broken and thrown in the trash in the short period of time we've owned this. Just really a disappointment overall."
2,Chalk board stinks,"After priming the board as the instructions indicated...it is still useless. The chalk actually cuts into the chalkboard so now, my daughter who loved chalk and drawing can't use that side of the easel. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone if they are looking for a product that does what it is supposed to do. I wonder if the makers even tried to use it...why would someone make a product that doesn't work and then expect people to buy it...very disappointing."
2,Not too stable & if you loose any piece you need to throw it away,This was a decent easel for about 2 months until one of the trays broke. This really messed up the stability of the whole unit. Then about an month later one of the side braces broke off and we had no choice but to throw it away. we then purchased a plastic one (i think it was made by Step2) which was a lot more sturdy.
1,didn't make a difference,I used this a few times and didn't do a thing for my dogs ears. Wasted money on this one.
1,do not buy!,"This is probably the worts edition, not the game itself just this retail version that it can be found on the internet for free of charge. So, do ur self a favor and dont buy this anywhere, anytime and for no one!"
1,IT'S A FREE GAME!!,do not buy! the game is free to play (single & multi) available for download at the official trackmania website!
5,Silver cleaner works & easy,Item came promptly and exactly what I was looking for. It was easy to use without a lot of additional buffing.
5,The BEST Silver Cleaner,"I had a jar of this cleaner for years - it was great at getting my silver jewelry nice and shiny and clean. When I ran out, I immediately went to the store to get another one. I couldn't find it and went to another store ... and another ... and another. I couldn't find it anywhere! I was so disappointed with the other cleaners I tried and was convinced that I wouldn't be able to find the ""good stuff"" ever again. Well, Amazon.com to the rescue! Not only was I able to find the ""good stuff"" again, but at a decent price. When I run out again (in a few years), I'll be right back here!"
2,Takes a lot to get tarnish off with this stuff,"I have a couple of sets of antique silver plated flatware from the Teen's and the 1920's. Previously I had used Tarnex and found it worked really well, but it was pretty smelly/messy. This stuff is messy to use, although you don't have to wear gloves unless you skin is very sensetive. The texture is kind of goopy and gets everywhere if you are not careful. I think I am going back to Tarnex to clean my antique flatware."
2,Wright's Cream replaced by Weiman's,"I have used Wrights Cream many years and with good results. The Wright's Company has been bought by the Weiman Company, and the Weiman jars look just like the Wright's I have always used. Today I used the new Weiman Cream for the first time and was very disappointed. It took twice as long to clean a few pieces, and the results were poor, compared to what I was used to with Wright's."
4,My wife says it the best,My wife says it the best. It's the only thing she will use on her silver jewelry. Easy to use and a good thing to have around.
5,wow this is an amazing product!,"i ordered this product worried it wasn't going to work how i expected. it delivered and then some! it comes in a medium size jar (enough to last a while i think) with a small sponge. just apply small amount to cream to the sponge, i didn't use any gloves, and rub your silver. not much actual rubbing, it pretty much works by itself. i absolutely love this silver polish would buy again without hesitation."
5,Works well!,"What can I say? It did what it was supposed to do, and it was easy to use. Highly recommended."
4,Volume problem?,"The only complaint I really have is the music. With the exception of one song in the 1st mile, I can barely hear the music at all. I can hear Leslie talking no problem, in fact her voice is much louder than the music. Otherwise, this one is a definite keeper! I prefer Leslie alone, as opposed to her groups, because I like to focus on Leslie's movements (I'm pretty uncoordinated!) and sometimes her group members are just a tad ""off."""
5,Daily Exercise,"I desperately needed to lose weight and I knew exercise was part of it. I hate exercising. But I found that Leslie Sansone walking videos were okay and even enjoyable and this is a really good one. I now walk three miles (minimum) a day and have lost 60 lbs in 6 months. I didn't think it could happen at my age (70). This video and her others are not macho heart pounding weight room workouts, but I am living proof that they work."
5,Fabulous over 50!,For someone who doesn't like exercise - this is it! A bit of time in the morning and you are good to go for the day.
2,Disappointed,"I just finished doing the workout and am really disappointed. This is my second dvd of Leslie's and thought that this dvd was in no comparison to the 5 mile fat burning dvd I first bought. I was really surprised to hear that half of the songs played were the same songs played in the other dvd I had. I expect when I buy a different dvd that it would at least have different music. Also, the few new tracks played were very low beat and didn't get me motivated to put my all in the workout. Overall I wouldn't recommend this dvd for veterans of Leslie Sansone's exercise dvds."
5,Walk Away Belly Fat,Perfect condition! Fast on the shipping. Love the DVD! Amazing workout! Absolutely no complaints!
2,Disappointed in the set up,"Kathy in Ohio mentioned the fact that the first and last miles of the three miles covered are not true miles since they incorporate the warm up and the cool down,and I agree this is disappointing, but the other thing I think is disapointing is that it's presented in the menu as chapters... ""mile 1, mile 2, mile 3"" but in all actuality it's just the video that keeps playing. I had to stop it myself once mile 1 was completed. There was also no option to just go to the abs portion except to begin the program and fast forward through all three miles. Technology is too advanced for this type of laziness... she's not saving any money in the cost of video production by just lumping it all in together. I'll be bringing this one back. Hopefully I can find a Sansone video that works more in chapter form so I can use her program... I like the walking idea for bad weather days."
5,Walk Away Fan,"Great workout. I love that it's just Leslie. I have 5 other Walk Away workouts and prefer her alone. Hearing the other walker's stories day after day gets old fast: ""this walker is a grandmother, this walker is over 50 and has lost 20 pounds, this walker is in his 70's, and etc"". The first time you hear the stories they are encouraging. But after several months... not so much. I enjoy the workout better when Leslie stays on topic."
4,"leslie sansone, walk your belly flat","I really like this CD. I have several of her walking exercises. I have only done the consistent exercising for about 2 months. So far not a lot of results (weight loss), but I do feel better. I like to mix up all of the walking tapes. This one is a nice walk if you don't have a lot of time.Gran"
4,walk,"leslie does a great job in all her walk videos. i have been using her 5 mile walk , you do a mile in 12 min. i like that the best. i find after 3 weks i am getting bored even though you get a decent workout."
3,a good workout,this is a good workout where Leslie is on her own throughout the workout.I have to say I prefer it when she has the other walkers with her but it is a very good dvd.
3,Walk Your Belly Flat,"I recently purchased the new Leslie Sansone DVD, Walk at Home-Walk Your Belly Flat. I gave this DVD 3 stars, because she is walking by herself. I enjoy doing the walk more when she has her buddies walking along with her. I like to watch her interaction with the other walkers. But I did like the stomach exercise that was at the end of the walk.Walk at Home-Walk Your Belly Flat"
5,"Love it, gets the job done",I have been using Leslie's program since 2003 when I first came across her VHS Tape which I was still using up until 2 years ago. I have since bought 3 sets of her DVDs for me and others.She is motivational.
4,Great product,I received my DVD within days after I purchased it. I have been using it religiously ever since I took it out of the package. I'm considering buying more of this kind of workout DVD.
4,Leslie Sansone:Walk at Home: Walk Your Belly Flat,The DVD was delivered earlier than scheduled by JuCo in perfect condition. I enjoy Leslie Sansone but there aren't any new moves in this DVD with the exception of the last segment with the abdominal exercise.
5,This is Great!,Leslie always delivers in her workouts. They are designed for all age groups and makes you want to get up and exercise. Working out with Leslie on a regular basis will definitely produce results!!I have many of her workout tapes and will continue to purchase new ones as I need them.
1,Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home: Walk Your Belly Flat,"I like all Leslie videos, but I was disappointed in this one because it was much like her other and very little Ab work out, I guess I was hoping for more"
3,"good, but music poort, moves same as watp","I'm mixed on this dvd.Pros- moves easy to follow, lots of kicks/knee lifts.Leslie is likeable, your average person.Cons- music is poor, can hardly hear it on the 2/3rd mile.Moves are the same as the watp dvds.She's alone, sort of like it, sort of dislike it.Background is black, boring to look at.Even though its on the boring side, I like it though. Dont really understand it."
4,Leslie Keeps You Moving,"This dvd is as expected, but I hate the clock going in the corner. Makes the workout seem longer than it is."
3,Good walking tape,I love Leslie Sansone walking tapes. I have been using it for a few weeks now and it makes me sweat it gives a little variety and keeps me moving. Buy it :)
5,Walk at Home,This is a very good work out video. It gets me moving and my heart rate up. I know that I have worked out after I have done it.
3,Wish There Was More For Losing or Firming Your Belly,"My wife and I workout together - and have benefitted from Leslie's videos substantially. I think all her videos are helpful insofar as they are fairly low impact and she does a good job of leading you positively to do what she does to get through the workouts. My disappointment here, is simply I wish there was more along the lines of focusing on losing fat in, or toning your belly area - a very difficult area for myself and my wife. However, overall, as typical I do recommend this DVD - but just wish it would have been more focused on walking your ""belly flat."""
2,How to Make Dublin Boring,"Having read the suberb Cityscapes book on Lima I ordered this book because I spent much time in Dublin in the 1950's and was interested in its transformation to a city so different than the De Valera years. I was very disappointed. She covered all the history and the buildings of Dublin but in a curiously stilted fashion.The charm of the city, its remarkably lively inhabitants, the enormous talent in its literary culture seemed buried in a wealth of historical details which one could get in any competent guide book."
5,excellent tv,"After 18 years with our faithful 20-inch Mitsubishi (beautiful color control, multiple hook-ups available in the back, etc) we were afraid we could not find a tv similar. Wrong. Based only on the feedback reviews from amazon.com and ratings from Consumer Reports, we bought the 24-inch Toshiba. It is everything our old Mitsubishi was and more. The control of color and sharpness and detail are superb; there are the same multiple connections (plus the 'S' connection which we never had); and a remote that controls not only the tv but our old cable box and the Sony recorder. If it lasts half as long as our old tv, we'll be happy."
3,Old School Postal Playa,"This book is a trip! You would have to work for the Post Office to really understand that this guy got stories that are likely true. He walks the walk and talks the talk like the old school players who these days would be retiring with 35-40+ years of service. He knows the discipline system, scheme accuracy, and a slightly fizzled-out culture. When you read it, you'll say this can't be real. Yes it can!"
4,"Crude, rude and superb","Got into Bukowski by chance last year and lets just say I am loving his work. Post office along with women is probably one of my favorites pieces of literature and this is definitively one novel I can't wait to read again. Just love this down and out character 'Hank' that bukowski has come up with and all the sleazy, grim and gritty situations he gets himself into. It's so real to life and that's what I love about it."
3,Not Bukowski's best but certainly a fun read,The second I put Ham on rye down i picked up Post Office. What scares me about Bukowski is how much he reminds me of my father and through this critical assessment I realise he is just like me. DAMN! Post Office lacks the interesting character plays of Ham on Rye and Women but how can you not love anything to do with Henry Chinaski?? The guy is a complete failure you can't help but love. Post Office has much fewer sexual rendezvous than I'm used to which was actually a nice change. Obviously Chinaski gets hit with the middle age horn rod and after leaving the post office continues to a rockstar life of successful author and hetero hero in Women. Everything Bukowski is good.
3,"Overrated, nearly plot-less, hardly intelligent, mildly funny","Overrated, nearly plot-less, hardly intelligent, mildly funny (not as funny as the cover claims it is), and oddly entertaining. If Bukowski was a better writer, he could have turned this into a great piece of work. As it is, it's okay, and disappointing with ""what could have been"". I'm not sure why I'm compelled to give it 3 stars, but according to Amazon, 3 stars = liked it, 2 stars = didn't like it, 4 stars = really liked it, 5 stars = loved it. I liked it. I just didn't really like it or love it. So there it is."
3,Likeable but hardly profound...,"I read Post Office in two hours whilst waiting for a flight from Vienna to London. The stark simplicity of the prose and the pace of the narrative make this a genuine page turner but when I reflected on it, I realised that I had learn very little about American society that I didn't already know or suspect. OK, to alleviate the tedium of routine, people seek excitement through alcohol, sex etc. Sometimes it's rewarding, sometimes it's not. When it's not the results can often be painful - all very true but not exactly groundbreaking. Henry is an endearing character - an interesting combination of sceptic and samaritan - but, funny though he is at times, I'm not sure whether Bukowski quite deserves so illustrious a reputation."
2,"Someone, explain to me what I missed","I heard an interview with a man who recently released a documentary about Charles Bukowski. I got so enthused I bought several of his books. Almost all of the reviews I read were glowing. ""LIFE CHANGING!"" ""MASTERPIECE!"" ""AWE INSPIRING!"" Well, it was inspiring, but I'm not sure exactly what it inspired me to do. I read this book and felt nothing. No, I take that back. I felt like I was totally ""not"" getting the point or the genius. I didn't like the characters. I didn't like the story (I'm a government employee and I couldn't even relate to it!). But, I persevered and finished the book. Only to be left with one burning question....HUH? Seeing as how everyone seems to love Bukowski, I'm trying another one of his books. I'm giving him another shot. But I'm just not feeling it. Maybe it's a male/female difference of perspective. I just don't know."
2,disappointing,"Bukowski's narrative voice and the confidence of his writing are always compelling, yet time after time I finish his novels feeling somehow cheated (with the exception of ""Ham on Rye"", which he seemed to put some effort and thought into). He's unwilling or unable to reveal insight into his own behavior and his female characters are devoid of any real presence or depth, aside from their moments of neediness, horniness and hysteria. In this particularly shabby effort, he somehow avoids dealing with what is presumably the entire point of the novel--presenting the day to day tedium of holding a job for 11 years. Soon after describing how he established himself as a postal clerk, he strangely skips the rest of his employment there... the novel then picks up a decade later with a series of warning letters he received, and ends with him quitting. A lot of promise, but shoddily done."
5,Brilliant. Buy this book and borrow it to you friends.,"I love this book. It's genius in it's simplicity. Buy it, read it, and pass it along."
1,Post Office by Charles Bukowski,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read, and I read alot. This was a book picked for the book club I'm in and not one person enjoyed it. It was a chore to even finish. Don't waist your time. Horrible."
4,Start here.,"Post Office provides an excellent introduction to Bukowski and will encourage you to pick up more of his work. His advice to struggling (or psuedo) writers ""write what you know"" is easily demonstrated in this novel. If you're not familiar with Buk, start here."
3,Way less boring than most books you can buy,"This is great. The story is about a lecherous slacker drunk who hates the prison that is the working stiffs life. Its about all the mean spirited rule following bastards that inhabit the straight world and how if you confront them head on you get cut out of the deal. There is a lot in the book about the central character Henry Chinaski ... and being tortured by having to work. It is short and to the point and really funny. No bloated tedious prose here, just something you can actually enjoy reading. Buy it."
3,Just A Cog in the Wheel,"So numbed by the insane, machine like regulatons and repitition of his job at the U.S. Post Office, Henry Chinaski searches for a good time with booze, loose women and gambling. Oh wait, he was doing that before he joined the Post Office. Oh well. If not the Post Office, it could just as easily have been Wal-Mart or General Motors. Most blue collar jobs suck and there are a lot of people like good 'ol Hank just trying to find some fun in the few hours they're not having every minute of their work day monitored, timed, evaluated and used against them. Pretty funny book. Pretty depressing book. Pretty realistic book, though Hank gets more action than most of us I think. Perhaps it's even unique."
4,Van Gogh's Brother gave him free paints,"There seem to be two school of thoughts on Bukowski; One is the elitist PhD line of thinking that he was uncouth rubbish, the other is this slacker generation who view him as some kind of rebel wildman role model. The truth is somewhere in the middle I think.While I don't find Bukowski half as memorable as ,say, Henry Miller, he is a very talented writer and ""Post Office"" flows extremely well from beginning to end. Bukowski is one of the few writers who can make me laugh out loud and there are scenes in this book (when he singlehandedly changes US Postal rules by accidentally setting fire to the mail, his conversation with a crazy writer co-worker who ends their talk by screaming ""Van Gogh's brother gave him free paints) which are exceptional. An entertaining and enjoyable book but don't read it if you are expecting profundities on the meaning of life."
3,"Grungy, Dirty, Real","I read this book mainly due to the endorsement on the front that is it ""One of the funniest books ever written"". I didn't find it so. It is a book about a regular American man who is not happy in his job and not happy in his relationships. He lives a seedy life and gets by. The author, Bukoski, was a prolific writer and has been described as a ""laureate of American lowlife"".The novel is Bukoski's first and was published in 1971.Despite being different from what I expected, I finished it and it was readable. I had a soft spot for the main character (narrator) Chinaski. I wanted to see how it would turn out for him, I was interested in his every day, often sordid, life. It takes good writing to draw the reader in like that, so I would say it is a book worth reading. However, I don't think I will be reading any more in a hurry."
3,Good when you need brainless entertainment,"I'm not sure how I found this or even why I read it all the way through. Something about it made me keep going. It was funny, guy, dry humor. I liked the very simple writing style. That was actually impressive. I also related to the office politics and BS similar to the movie Office Space. I really wish I could give this a 3.5 stars. It kept me going somehow, but wasn't a page turner. This is perhaps the best book to read before bedtime. It's not so bad that you can't read it, but it isn't so great that you can't put it down. Just a basic funny (at times) story with no purpose."
3,"Funny, obnoxious and disjointed.","It wasn't nearly as good as popular acclaim would make out. Perhaps a candid autobiography of a loser. Worth reading, but I'd borrow it from a library."
4,The dirt under LA's nails.,"Leave it to Bukowski to never polish anything tarnished. If this seems to be an overly harsh look at the post office, it takes but further reading of his works to realize that almost everything is treated in this manner. If you finish a Bukowski book and don't smell the BO, then try it again.Not my personal favorite (try Ham n' Rye for instance) but still very worthy of a read. This is still Bukowski in top form by any measure."
5,A Winner!,"One of Buk's best. Easy to read style. If you think postal workers have it easy...I suggest you read this book (although Bukowski makes it all interesting and even funny at times). This reminds me of another book by Kirk Alex entitled Working the Hard Side of the Street (about driving a cab in L.A.) The daily grind of working a crummy job in order to pay rent is something most of us can relate to. That's why we cherrish books like this and writers who can speak to us in a pared down, no B.S. manner. We miss you, Buk."
2,Not the Best,"I'm not giving this book two stars because I'm one of those Bukowski-haters. I love his writing. But this isn't the best book of his that I've read. I believe it was published fairly early in his career, which might indicate better was to come from Bukowski. If you don't own any Bukowski books, I'd advise you to buy ""Run with the Hunted"" rather than this one."
5,Awesome...Must Read!!!,I didn't put this book down once I opened it. Oh how I can relate to this story. the Post Office. Please do not hesitate on reading this book!
4,Skid Row Laureate,"If you're tired of reading boring books about a ""good"" guy who has everything in his life straight then Buk is for you. He shows how the other half lives. How the drunks and the bums make it from day to day...scratching out the days working jobs they hate (like the post office) just so that they may have enough money to do what they want...in Buk's opinion that was beer and women...A great great book by him. Probably the easiest book to read that he wrote. Buy it and enjoy it. But remember when you step into Henry Chinaski's world you're stuck forever."
4,brutally honest-funny-and somehow touching,Bukowski was a genius. A vulgar Hemingway. Post Office may be his magnum opus. I read it in less than 24 hours and I'm sure you will as well.
3,Hoping this will help,"I haven't had a real chance to get too far into the book yet, but hope this helps me raise miniature roses. I haven't had much luck so far, though I do seem to do very well with other plants. Check back in a year."
4,book,I enjoyed the read very much. The copy I received was in very good condition. I have bought used books before that were in poor condition even when they were rated to be in a good condition.
2,"Don,t bother","I have read all other Susan Wilsons books, and loved them, but this one was like a diferent author wrote it. It took me forever to get through this book. Boring, boring, boring."
4,Wonderfully written book that drew me in right away,"This is a beautifully-written, warm-hearted book about family, obligations, and home. Sabine's origins are shrouded in mystery. Her mother, Ruby, keeps them on the move. On the run, as it turns out, though Sabine doesn't realize the reason for this until she's an adult. Sabine inherits the abilities of her two psychic parents, but she longs to put down roots, and so goes to live in a small town. The romance between Dan and her blossoms slowly--perhaps a bit too slowly for me. The passion isn't super hot, but there's a believable connection between them and Dan was attractive inside and out. I guessed the ending well ahead, but the writing and the paranormal aspects of this book kept me reading. A book I won't soon forget."
3,This was an ok read. It is not a romance novel.,"It is about Sabine, a psychic who talks with ghosts. She meets and falls in love with Dan, but there is a conflict because she wants to stay in her home town, and he travels most of the time due to his work.Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: not counted, maybe two or three. Setting: 2000 Moose River Junction. Copyright: 2002. Genre: contemporary fantasy fiction."
1,Better left in SI,"While Walter Iooss has captured the spirt of football, from sandlot to the big show, too many of his panoramic shots have been laid-out across a full two page spread leaving the intended ""heroes"" centered in the spine of the book. There are also numerous pages that have been left blank for no apparent reason. If you really want some memorable Walter Iooss photographs you would be better off looking through old Sports Illustrated."
5,Best Advice ever!,"This book has been a life saver for me post surgery. All the information is easy to understand, and follow. Colleen and Ken have deeply researched this topic and I would recommend every patient OR person not wanting surgery - to follow this guideline for successful weight loss. Yes, it also works and can be applied to non-surgery patients as well."
2,Glorified Pamphlet,"As a Registered Nurse and candidate for bariatric surgery, I have begun reading books and searching websites in search of information and encouragement.There's really nothing wrong with the information in this book.It's just that there's so little of it.There are about 12 pages of genuinely useful information and about 20 pages of interesting patient-experience descriptions.Colleen Cook compiled those 20 or so pages, she didn't write themShe has written a list of 6 habits that she sets out well on 12 pages.That's a pamphlet, not a book.In addition, there's no real medical evidence cited in any of her recommendations.They are taken from her and other's real life experience and although that is useful, I think some real data would have been more helpful."
2,The Success Habits of Weight-Loss Surgery Patients,"Of all the weight loss surgery books I've read, and there have been a few, *The Success Habits of Weight-Loss Surgery Patients* was barely memorable. In my opinion if you're truly serious about having weight loss, the best book you can get is ""The REAL Skinny on Weight Loss Surgery"". Having contemplated the surgery for well over 2 years, it is time to take the step to improving and hopefully prolonging my life. ""The REAL Skinny..."" will be the book I turn to again and again and one I will recommend to patients."
3,OK,That's all I can say. This book is OK at best. Disappointed in the information. I could have written something more useful!
2,Good but obvious,This book is very valuable if you are completely clueless about what you should do after weight loss surgery.
5,A Tremendous Read,"This really is a great read. After a slow start, it took me a while to read the first 100 pages but I devoured the last 100, it really was an enjoyable.The story gives a great insight into farming in the heartland of America, describing in some detail the hazards and perils of life on the farm, some natural and some man mad.I guess I never really believed characters like Mr Finken are really out there is this part of the world but I am sure they are now.The book, written through the eyes of Hadley Carlyle, gives a great insight into the struggles of this way of life but there is a humorous side to this story as well, which is skilfully incorporated.After I finished the book it somehow left me wanting more, so come on lets have a sequel and soon."
5,Kansas,"Re-Saturday Review of LiteratureOscar Acosta disappeared in Mexico in 1974, not 1971 (the year of his trip to Las Vegas with Dr. Thompson)."
3,Ok,This one was alright the ending left much to be desired and the editors of this do a terrible job please pay attention to what you are writing
3,Different than the movie.,"I wish that I had read a few before buying so many of them. It's much different than the original movie. Still, it has potential to be good."
5,mediterranean sunset,LOVE IT LOVE IT Play it all the time great background music . happy holiday music Sandra
1,Unimpressed,"I was totally unimpressed with these strings. Used them on my Ovation 1861 Balladeer and they were OK for about a day. Then, they became lifeless all at once ... the brightness was gone and they played very, very hard. The sound was choked and playing became difficult. Thinking this may have been a bad set of strings, I tried another set of them and the same thing happened. A colossal waste of money. Save yours and buy something else."
4,"The counseling book entitled, ""Thus Saith God's Word: is an excellent tool to used when you are involved with Telephone Evangeli",The book is a great tool to use for Counseling and for other forms a evangelism. The Scriptures are awesome.by Martha A. Addison
3,Less Expensive at Lee Valley,"I saw this sod lifter here, but also looked at Lee Valley Tools. I bought from Lee Valley as it was $68 including shipping. The Lee Valley version appears to be very similar. I've been using it for the past month with no complaints."
1,Razor Back Sod Cutter is questionable,"This item advertised is clearly questionable. The label on it states to use a sharp spade for cutting and then use the sod lifter. The review that states, to just jab it in the sod is also questionable unless your a huge man because one needs to step on it like a shovel. Want to really cut the sod get a Hook N Crook tool---it slices under the sod and really works as advertised. Then use your expensive sod lifter, which at this point all you really need to do is pull is up with your hands.Buyer beware, don't fall for the cutting part, there is not a sharp edge on this item. If it were true, why does it state to use a spade to cut?????"
4,Liked it but too much interview style,"In a similar interview style as When Harry Met Sally, it definitely contains more sex. Great concept and its true when you find something better than sex, it is special."
2,Disappointing erotic teaser,"It's suggests titillation, but fails to deliver. Pretty people, an obvious plot, suggestive scenes, with little substance, no originality, even less wit. If they want to film erotic stories, why don't they do it boldly and with at least a little flair."
5,Doesn't get any Better,No latch issues on mine and they work great! Price is right and you couldn't get a better hand held functioning tool. Very well constructed with precision and effort free trimming.
3,Good Sturdy Shears,I like these shears for their durability. They are sturdily constructed and the blades are sharp and cut well. The only drawback is that they are very stiff and my hand hurts after just a couple of minutes of working with them. For the money though they are the best I have seen.
3,Not at all as good as best reviews state,Perhaps I was pulled in by the loftiest of praises for these shears & am thus most disappointed. I also wanted to believe they were better b/c made in America. My high expectations led to disappointment. I do not find them to be appreciably better than those bought at Lowes.
4,"NOT used or refurbished! Excellent, but I wish....","These grass shears work very well, and require much less effort than expected, so that I'm able to do a lot of clipping without tiring or soreness. A couple of reviewers commented on the upper blades appearing used or refurbished. Doesn't look that way at all to me: looks like some irregular paint application affecting only the top blades - just an insignificant manufacturing variation.But, I am wishing I had bought shears that adjust to cutting at 3 different angles, like for cutting along edges, where I'd like the blades to cut vertically at ground level. One point off for lacking this feature, but there's hardly a better choice if you don't need this feature."
3,Okay Garden Shear,"These are built okay. Comfortable handle, good blades and such. There is a latch to keep the blades closed when not in use. The latch latches itself over and over while using them, Gets real irritating after a while. If you remove the wire latch, it solves the problem. Shouldn't have to alter a brand new tool but if you want to stay sane, you may have to."
3,BUYER BEWARE - Grass Shear's Steel Blades Not Stainless...,"I'm a big fan of buying and owning stainless steel garden tools in which to avoid the curse of metal rusting and because of stainless' inherent easy care maintenance. As such, I particularly bought this grass shear because of it's Amazon's advertised product features and product description statements clearly indicated that it's blades were stainless steel. A simple magnet-test on the blades showed that the blades are made of common steel metal - NOT STAINLESS! (FYI: Stainless steel has no or a much weak magnet pull). However as many other reviewers comment here, this garden hand-tool is seemingly durable and constructed very well. In desperate need for a handy sturdy garden tool as this, I plan to keep and use this falsely labeled garden tool, and will wait-and-see how much of a maintenance rust issue it eventually becomes."
3,Distracting accents,"I totally agree with vt1752 about those god-awful accents Ms. Andersen insists on using. I finished the book but toward the end I swore if I read ""Gawd, James!"" one more time I would scream! I did enjoy the story and I decided to try another one of her books, Baby, I'm Yours, but once again, more southerners. This time it's ""Jayzus"" (Jesus) every few sentences. (I guess she couldn't make up her mind on the spelling because she alternates between Jayzus and Jaysus. Either way, both are annoying. I'll give her credit and blame the copy-writer. Hopefully all of her books aren't set in the south."
2,A southern girl in need of help.,A woman seeking a new life. A man's search for revenge for his wife's departure. A love affair with a macho man. Sounds exciting? That's what I thought in the beginning. Unfortunately it leads to a slow paced love affair which helped me doze off at nights. The suspense that I expected was not there and that was the main reason I purchased the book.
3,An 31/2* effort by Andersen,"The story was good but could have been better as a regular romance instead of suspense romance. There was so much potential for a wonderful suspense story but I feel that Andersen did not take the ball and run with it.Aunie escapes from her abusive and delusional es-husband to start a new life in Washington State. Here she does her level best to start a new life for herself and surrounds herself with a new circle of friends. One of these friends is James Ryder a 'wrong side of the tracks cartoonist' who finds himself against his own judgement drawn to his ""magnolia"" despite all of her problems.Again it is a good story with really likeable characters. It only falls short on the suspense area. If you are a fan of Susan Andersen you don't want to miss this read. If you are new to Susan Andersen don't let this turn you against a very talented author. It is just not one of her best."
2,High expections...let down,I am so disappointed by this book! I hate to agree with the other reviewers but I do. I love Susan Andersen she is a great writer. But this book had me snoozing! It started out good but it just dragged and was boring. It was not suspenseful at all. I might have liked the book more if they didn't claim it to be romantic suspense on the spine. It was just okay. I would recommend her other romantic suspense Exposure however. That was a wonderful book!!
2,disappointing,"Aunie Franklin flees her unbalanced abusive ex-husband to start a new life in the Pacific Northwest. She grows close to a new circle of friends she meets there, while falling for bad boy James Ryder, a cartoonist with an attitude. As a suspense premise, the material here is slim. Perhaps that's why the plot never really delivers the expected tension. The only present danger in this book is that of being bored to death. There's way too much introspection and not enough of Andersen's usually wonderful dialogue. Readers should definitely pick up one of this author's other books for a great read. I'd encourage you to pass this one by, though."
3,It's in French!...,"Despite the fact that ALL SIX of the ""Excerpt"" pages shown above as samples are in ENGLISH, which would naturally lead one to believe that this book is WRITTEN in English, it is NOT! In other words, aside from approximately 15 pages in English found in the front of the book, all the other 377 pages it contains are written in FRENCH! Therefore, unless you read French, and read it well, I would recommend that you do NOT buy this book!"
1,Not in English,"Had hoped that this might be a red guide in English. It isn't in English, notwithstanding the Amazon title of ""Paris and Environs"". I am sending it back."
4,A good resource,"This is a very useful guide to the New York State 5th Grade Social Studies test. The book gives a very clear idea of the types of questions that will be asked on the exam, the level of difficulty and how to approach each problem. This is a book designed for parents and teachers who are preparing their kids for the test. There are two full exams with answers and excellent explanations. Overall, I think the book is a very good tool and is worth getting.The book's one drawback is that it does not have a very thorough review of the actual material that the test will cover. There is a very good vocabulary list. But that is really all in the way of substance. This may be because the actual exam does not test volumes of facts, but basic skills and concepts."
4,Great for the $,"Does not cost too much & is a Great value.Lasts for quite awhile with no problems,no eating tapes or anything. I love this goody :)"
1,It can not play with tape,"I set it up to receive the antenna cable from the wall outlet, then output to the TV, as I did to another VCR in the house. But the TV does not receive any signal, and I can not play the video tape, looks like a defect product to me, and I will have to return it.Another problem is that the sound is mono, not stero...a surprise to me."
2,Doesn't deliver the goods,"This book was hyped as a ""simple"" solution to weight loss. The concepts may be simple but don't confuse simple with easy. The concept of climbing mount Everest is simple too. Somehow this ""simple"" set of solutions leads to a seemingly endless trail of products and seminars that will eventually get you where you want to be. I have no patince for a book that is merely a tease and a marketing tool to get you deeper in debt to it's author. Whatever good ideas were in this book got lost in my anger of being shilled."
5,"A cure, not a quick fix","This book has changed my life. Laurel presents a program that if followed has the power to cure weight problems not just give a quick fix that will rebound to more weight gain. Using real life examples and specific questions you can ask yourself, Laurel guides you along the pathway to a weight solution with humor, insight, and compassion."
3,"""The Pathway"" or ""3 Day Solution Plan"" are better-same author.","While ""The Solution"" is a good read, save your time and gain new information and insight with one of the newer books by the same author. The Solution method has evolved since the writing of this book and there is much more detail and research based information in the later publications. Bottom line: The Solution Method works. The Pathway turned my life around and the most recent publication, The 3 Day Solution Plan contains the ""science"" behind what drives us to go to ""excess""."
3,"The Solution: For Safe, Healthy, and Permanent Weight Loss by Laurel Mellin","Good information, short and to the point. That said I have to admit I had to think which book this was, as it apparently didn't have any outstanding qualities."
3,This program is VERY EXPENSIVE!,"This book is wonderful...and even tho Laurel Mellin is a thin person she does have the compassion and grasp of the problems facing compulsive eaters. I lost 25 lbs and kept it off after three months of group work but had to quit due to the high cost. As the ""Institute"" recommends there are 4 to 5 sessions of 12 week long intensive group therapy involved... to receive your internal solution. At $500 a session it's easily $2000 or more for a full year. Has a great success rate tho. Just steel yourself for that big price tag in exchange for a changed life and success.I think one of the big places where there is room for improvement is the corny terminology used- felt very uncomfortable with it. Just stale and outdated."
5,It will change your life. An incredible book!!!!!!,"I enjoyed this book very much. After I read it, I felt as if I finally had a means to help my weight problem. It is helping me get in touch with the feelings that I stuff when I eat. The book felt like it was written for me, about me and with me in mind. So much of it adressed what I always knew in my heart to be true but could not figure out how to express. It is nice to see that someone has finally realized that it is now just about diet and exercise but that there is more to a healthy life style"
2,Not everyone is one size fits all,"This book is a very 'one size fits all'. according to the writer, it *appears* she suggests that everyone with a weight issue has these 6 issues and that unless you fix these 6 issues in the way SHE states, you can not be cured. It blames your parents for their lack of 'insert what ever here'. Not everyone has these exact issues and writing a book that reads like a vcr manuel without no real guidance doesnt help I dont feel. I got nothing at all out of the book and was rather put off by her claiming to understand the root of all the problems with overweight people. I dont appreciate the blame being placed on parents. We, ourselves, are responsible for the most part. I dont like the 'know it all' approach. I didnt even get through the entire book before I took it back to the library. It was dull and boring with no real help of HOW to go about doing what she suggests.personal opinion only."
5,An excellent book for a marvelous work !,This little book is an excellent reedition of the incredible work of origami master Issei Yoshino. I recommand this item to all the good or very good leveled origamist !
4,great harmonica,"i first bought the harmonica in the key of Ab and i loved it. the shape is very ergonomic, the carved shape. the bends in pitch i could make. the price , well these make this unit a great deal so i bought most all of the.what to compare the honer blues harp in g. that has comb plate cutting my mouth and sharp edges. i take the huang first"
2,DON'T BUY!!! READ THIS!,"this product does work like on t.v. BUT i would say it cooks the same as normal metal pans. IT IS SOOOO HARD TO CLEAN!!! the grease stuck on and i tried cleaning it immediately, but it became sticky and filmy. tried soaking it in water. no luck. even bought the new dish soap W/ bleach. still no luck. when product dries, white film appears. UCK! VERY DISSATISFIED! want to throw it out but spent so much money. DON""T BUY!"
1,Fraudulent,"I specifically ordered 1 set of pans, and I received 7 sets. The company would not return the pans for me or refund any of my money. I was told several times that I could sell them myself and make more money than what I paid for them."
1,One Bad Disc out of Three,"Amazon quickly replaced my first kit order as the ""Hips & Thighs"" disc was bad. The second kit had the same issue with the disc. I could only hear the base booming but could not hear what Leslie was saying. I gave up on returning it as I liked the other two discs and exercises. Just avoid buying this kit--buy the items separately."
4,Beautifully written debut stories!!!,"I really enjoyed these 11 stories. Most of these stories are about childhood, growing up, and becoming mature adults. A lot of these stories will make you look back on your own life growing up as a child and all the experiences that that can entail. The author's sentences are thoughtfully written and in a very stylistic way. I was unhappy to see the book end, especially after reading the very emotional last story ""Come Live with Me and Be My Love"", about a middle-age man looking back on his 30 year arranged marriage. This was a truly touching story.I recommend this very human collection of stories. A great debut collection from Mr. Greer. I just hope there is more to come soon. He has a great elegant and poetic style of writing."
5,It Was Very Good For Me,"Andy Greer's first book, ""How It Was For Me,"" should be re-titled ""Best American Short Stories 1996-2000."" I've read his intensely fascinating stories in Esquire, Ploughshares, and Story, and was rewarded by being able to read them again in this collection, in addition to the new stories, each of which is an achievement, especially ""The Art of Eating"" and the marvelous ""Life is Over There."" Greer's subject is the unpredictable tenuousness and strength of affection between lovers, families, and strangers. These are important stories, and you should read them."
2,A mixed bag...,"I have to agree with Kirkus on this one. Many of the stories just went on and on and I lost interest midway through them. There were a couple of bright spots -- ""Come Live with Me and Be My Love"" being one of them -- but I constantly found myself flipping a few pages ahead to get past the dry spots."
1,"ack!!!! what the heck, Ms Oldenbourg????","I can't remember when I disliked the main characters of any novel so much. At least the ""baddies"" of ""The World is not Enough"" and ""The Cornerstone"" had some elements of fun and even sympathy at times. This one just made me want to slap both main characters to sleep, or send them to a good therapist. Maybe both."
5,Color for your Northwest Garden Every Month,A how-to book broken down month by month. Advice from a Seattle native on how to add color to your garden. The book is fun and takes you beyond the usual Northwest gardenscape. Did you know that the winter foliage of azaleas can be as spectacular as their Spring blooms?
4,The book for true Flower Fairies lovers,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. It contains all of the material from ""Flower Fairies of the Spring"" and a condensed version of the Cicely Barker biography. The only new material is 2 flower fairies who were apparently cut from the modern edition of ""F. F. of the Spring."" So, I would recommend this book only for those who collect all CMB books."
4,Black Dawn,"I collect alot of steven seagal dvds, and this is one of the beat action pack dvds. a good story, that keeps you to your tv. so if you are steven seagal fan, you will want to get this dvd."
4,Great DVD.,"I just bought this from Amazon recently, and I had to return it and get a replacement. The reason? The first DVD skips a lot during the song ""Never Let You Go"". Amazon sent the second DVD promptly, but it still has the same problem. It looks as if it is a defect from the factory. I decided to keep it since there is nothing else you could buy on Steelheart out there on DVD. Great band from the 80's, highly underrated, HUGE singer. It is a pity they were ""killed"" by the ""Seatle Grunge""."
5,Great DVD of a great band,This DVD has been a long time coming. Thank God it finally arrived - and TWO DVDs to boot! Great footage and sound. Love the 5 videos from MTV. A must have for any true rock music fan.
4,Easy to use,"I'm not 100% sure how much colder my A/C really is but the product was VERY easy to use. YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!! If you do, it takes you through every step. It probably wouldn't hurt if there was a trigger but it's not the end of the world"
2,gone with the wind,"This product has no trigger. So, As soon as you connect it, it starts spewing out. Whether it's connected right or not. Also when you shake the can the plastic fittings come loose. I know more went into the wind than the car. Get something with a trigger so you can control it. I bought AC PRO. It's a bit more expensive, But it's the best I've used yet. Walmart has started carrying it. And my AC is cold and holding the charge. I don't know if SUB ZERO is any good. I don't think any went in my car, so I can't judge that. Only the delivery system."
5,Don't Miss This Book!,"This is not the type of book that I normally read, so I started Icebergs with some apprehension. What a mistake it would have been to walk past this gem at the bookstore!! Icebergs is a wonderful, can't-put-it-down-once-you-start-it read. Ms. Johns' vivid descriptions transport the reader to another time and place and make you fall in love with the characters as you get to know them intimately. A gifted storyteller, I can't wait for her follow-up novel."
4,"good book, bad kindle editing","Good story, worth reading. Very compelling, well written. The kindle version needs to be re-edited, though. I stopped counting after 30 misspelled words."
2,Mediocre at best,The author can't make her mind up about her characters and the pace of the book is painfully slow. A lot of verbiage to sift through for very little reward.
4,I wish this book were longer!,"""...Arriving in the strange new city is, for Elisabet, like going to another country - the Louisiana Purchase has only just occurred recently, so the residents are still very much French or Spanish at heart. On top of this, she finds out that she is expected to work in her aunt and uncle's bakery as a shop assistant; this is very different from living in Boston with her father, where she went to school and had servants to wait on her. When she learns news of the ship that took her father prisoner, however, and is determined to rescue him from the British, she soon learns the value of friendship despite social class boundaries. ...""For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"

5,Icom FRS Two way Radio,A very heavy duty radio and i love it. it even lasted for a whole two weeks of boy scout camp even when it got drenched with rain
1,Pitiful aggie propaganda,"The book represents the all the worst aspects of the Texas aggie mentality--arrogance, narrow-mindedness, adherence to strict conformity. If one enjoys reading cliched potshots at UT (e.g., ""t.u., t.u.--where the girls are girls and the boys are too""), pathetic attacks on anyone who dares question ""tradition,"" and exhortations to be as mindless as possible for the sake of ""aggie spirit,"" then this book is for you. It confirms all the stereotypes of ""old ags."" Makes me glad I went to that ""other university""!"
4,it's one of those sit back and listen albums,It was in the back of a taxi going to Clapham that I heard Owoh for the first time and thankfully it was one of those 'sit back and enjoy the music' records. A great Nigerian gem!
1,Waste of money,"The sheets are very thin, and of extremely cheap quality. One wash and they are completely limp and unusable. I would rather have paid some more money and gotton better quality sheets."
2,Not As Soft,"Since the the last 7 years I have only been using jersey knitt for my bed, and I can clearly say these are not as soft as some others I have tried."
2,Disappointment,The color seems lighter than the graph and also the material used is not very good. Especially not fashion.
5,Kingsize jersey sheets hard to find...,I have not been able to find jersey sheets anywhere in FL for a kingsize bed. I am very pleased that I was able to find them on this site and even happier that they ended up being so nice. The price was great as well. I plan to buy a few more sets. This is a wonderful product. Thanks.
3,good price for good sheets,"I am pleased with this purchase. They are soft, like the T-shirt sheets that are out now. They have held up well to 2 washes to far."
1,Paper thin sheets is right!,"The bottom sheet ripped in the middle the first time I washed it! The blanket was and is still wonderful, but don't buy this for these sheets!"
3,Disappointed,"I was delighted when the package arrived promptly.The fitted sheet was easy to put on despite having to fit over a queen-sized mattress, and thick mattress pad.The standard size pillow cases went on with minimal struggle. However, the jersey material of the sheet set (including pillow cases), has retained a rough texture despite several washings."
2,Comfortable but raggedy,I bought a queen set. These bedsheets are thin and made of the same material cheap T-shirts are made of. The color is a faded blue. But they are great to sleep on and for personal use. Not for guests! I can live with this one but I dont think I will be buying anymore of these. Havent washed it so I dont know how it will look after that
1,Out of date,"The company (Versaware) that Simon & Schuster used for this product has gone out of business. Many of the links are no longer active. Technical support did not even know that there was a Macintosh version. The product is subtitled ""2001 and beyond"" but the software was copyrighted in 1999. This product is not worth it."
4,"George & Martha Men's Montreal Fleece Jacket, Black, XX-Large","Great price, good quality - exactly as I expected. Shipping was fast and packaged so the jacket was not damaged in shipment. Love it."
4,Affordable... but,"You simply cannot beat the price. The jacket looks good on the outside. A friend has a Timberland one that looks almost identical for 5x the price.The jacket is 100% polyester, lined with fleece.I ordered a medium. I usually order between a S-M. My body type is about average. The jacket fits, but feels a bit tighter than jackets from other manufacturers."
1,Clarifications,"... I am a student at The University of Michigan and have taken his BioAnthro 365 course. While I agree with many of the concepts and theories presented in the textbook, it is often times tedious even when used as a reference. I stopped reading the assigned chapters and used it as only a reference, which still proved difficult because many key terms were left unexplained. I would not recommend the book or the course, as Wolpoff is often times unclear and disprganized."
1,Pretentious Wolpoff strikes again!,"Wolpoff's book is literally unreadable and pretentious beyond words. I took a course from Wolpoff in the past, and as with his teaching, the book is often unclear, even at defining important vocabulary terms. Even as simply a reference this mammoth book fails miserably."
2,Worked great for 3 yrs.,I purchased this mixer 3 years ago and up until now I really loved it. However yesterday I went to make a batch of chocolate chip cookies and the speed control no longer works. The motor raced to the highest speed and I could not turn it down. I unplugged the unit in hopes that it would reset the unit but no deal. I am really disappointed that in only three years I will need to have it repaired or replaced.
1,didn't last,"After researching stand mixers, the Cousinart SM55 seemed the way to go. The power was way above other comparables. I bought it specifically for bread making.Today i used it for the first time. After about 30 seconds the motor started smoking. OK, maybe it's new. Bit in less than two minutes it had overheated and quit!. After a cool down period it restarted, but ran only 1 1/2 minutes. This with a batch of dough 1/2 of what they say it will handle.Its going back. Don't know if i will try another Cousinart. Had the same trouble with their blender/processor. Chinese goods are ruining a good product name."
3,cuisinart sm-55bc 5 1/2 quart,"I have had this product in the past and loved it. This time I ordered it, it came without any instructions, warranty info, and the top didn't sit on it right. Looks like it was a return item and it was passed to me as new. Not happy about that."
1,Not really a best choice!!!,I didn't know and there was no note that this product CAN'T work in different country then USA!!!So I end up buying 2 mixers and 1 blew already even though I bought nice converters to transfer the electricity in 120W....So it would be nice to state that this product can work ONLY IN USA!!!!
2,"such promise, but disappointing design","wonderful, we finally have an alternative to the noisy, splattering kitchen aid. but, wait, it has a larger motor! and yet when i tried this mixer i was very frustrated. it does not mix to the edge of the bowl. granted, it does not spatter, but it also does not mix even at the highest speed. it has a very stylish and, at first glance, a superior bowl, but this bowl has an open bottom that is sure to attract a nasty layer at one point or another. don't get me started on the stand itself. sad really because it did have promise. it is going into the garage graveyard for the next clearing sale."
5,I really enjoy this mixer.,"Recommended by Cooks Illustrated is what got my attention. But as I read other evaluations and saw one for myself I became ready to buy. Have made a number of different dishes. Meat loaf, biscuits, cookies, cakes, mashed potatos, etc. I really like the timer and the slow start feature before it comes up to full speed at what speed you have chosen. Wondered whether I should have purchased the larger capacity one, but this one has been great."
5,Excellent equipment!,"This mixer is great!!! Since it's expensive too, i think that it's a fair deal!If you want to expend this kind of money, don't think twice! go for it!"
2,Bread hook jams into appliance,"If you are going to purchase this, be sure to have a 15mm thin wrench. You will need it to remove the bread hook. As the machine kneads the dough, the nut on the attachment tightens. The plastic splashguard to protect the nut and shaft from getting dirty also makes it really difficult to use a normal wrench to loosen the nut. A really poor design. The Cuisinart staff was totally unhelpful. As someone else stated, the warranty is useless, mail in service only and user pays shipping both ways. This thing is huge and would cost a fortune to ship."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,I Love this machine! Made pecan bars soon as I received it. Family loved them. Next bread then cheesecake~ Wouldn't trade for KA!!!!
5,Wife loves it,"Bought this for the wife as a Christmas gift. She loves it and is using it as I type this. She was using a friend's Kitchenaid mixer for awhile. She liked it, too. However, as I started researching, I became worried of Kitchenaids reputation lately. Thought we'd try something different. The only thing she has noted is that she wished the splash lid was more effective. It only lies flat on the bowl, not into the bowl, and stuff still gets out. Also the opening on the lid doesn't have a seal, so stuff gets out there too."
5,Love It!,"I received processor as a belated Christmas gift from my husband-he did not know he got it for me :)Anyway, he likes it almost as much as I do. Everyweekend I make cookies and bread. They are so easy andenjoyable to mix with my cruisinart. I absolutely love it!"
4,Cuisinart SM-55Bc 5 1/2 quart 12 speed stand mixer,This is a great mixer will probably gain 10 lbs because it is so easy to use you can be very creative with it. I can handle heavy bread dough as well as whip egg whites with ease.
5,Fabulous Mixer!,I have a Kitchenaid but read the oustanding reviews the Cuisinart has been recieving. It blows KA well...out of the kitchen. My daughter now has my KA mixer. I don't think you will be sorry. A sound investment!
2,Buy a KitchenAid,"I have the 7 quart model, and the hinge is loose so that the top bounces quite significantly when mixing heavy dough. Today the dough hook separated from the threaded pin that is inserted into the mixer - the threads stripped on the cheap aluminum dough hook. I called Cuisinart, as while this is an obviously defective part / design, they essentially blew me off - 2 1/2 years after purchase - so ignore the purported better warranty....I have used KitchenAid mixers extensively in my culinary training, and in spite of their own issues, they are much sturdier, overheat less, bounce less, and I've had better warranty experience with them."
2,Cuisinart Stand Mixer,"Have owned my mixer for a little over 2 years. Have not used it for bread or anything substantial beyond cheesecakes and cookies. The main beater's coating has started coming off and leaves a weird black residue on the spatula when scraping. Shouldn't the beater be stainless steel like the bowl? Evidently not. Cheesecake is a pain because the beater doesn't quite scrape the bottom. Every so often, I have to pull the bowl out and scrape with a spatula. The gears slip sometimes -- while making cookie dough. I pity anyone attempting bread. The overall quality of the mixer is poor and I expect that like others, mine will soon give up the ghost.Before I went shopping for a new model, I thought I should warn others. I intend to get a professional, commercial grade mixer."
5,Great Mixer,"This mixer has met all my expectations except one. It is very sturdy and has power to mix large amounts of cookie dough. it is easy to clean and the spatter guard is terrific! The one complaint I have is that it is very noisy. I understand that other brands name mixers of this size seem to have the same problem, however. Even though it is noisy, I would recommend this mixer to anyone who is looking for quality."
3,VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!,"Full of power, Very Pretty ... BUT if you have a problem be prepared for the worst customer service around. Over a month and still no replacement part. Nothing is done in a speedy fashion. I""m going to buy extra beaters so I don't have to wait a month or more again.Machine itself is full of power ... and I am looking forward to using it. In the mean time it sits on the kitchen counter looking like a beautiful diva."
4,Works great,"I am very happy with this purchase. It works well and looks nice on the counter. It is a little loud, but not too bad."
1,Broke itself after three months,The first time I used this mixer to knead dough it seems like it overheated and started running at the highest speed. I had to unplug it and let it cool off. Then it started working again. However now after six months it is always running at high speed regardless of what speed is chosen.Will not buy a cuisinart mixer again.
1,Don't use this with meat grinder add-on,My unit died just about when the 1-year warranty expired. The manufacturer replaced the unit with a new one. I then used the new unit to grind some cubed pork loins (nothing beats knowing what is in your ground meat). The replacement died on me just like the original unit purchased - pressing the switch produces a clicking sound but motor does not come on. Two units not working makes me think that the product is inferior.
4,Great Mixer but...,"First of all, we love this mixer. All of the features are great and the machine works as well as should be expected. The only complaint we have is with a minor repair issue. The mixer is constructed well of mainly metal parts with the exception of the tilt back head lever. The lever is plastic and made poorly. We broke the plastic piece and upon calling customer service learned we would have to ship the entire unit back to them as well as pay for return shipping.This is a heavy mixer and will cost several dollars to ship as well as require a $10 return shipping charge all for a small plastic piece that could be shipped for less than a dollar. It seems a bit unneccessary for me to spend nearly $20 and be without our mixer for 4-6 weeks when a part they will replace under warranty could easily be shipped much more efficiently."
4,Cusinart Mixer,"I purchased this mixer after my old Braun's dough hook broke off in the head of my mixer. It was a wedding gift and only 23 yrs old! I was concerned at what to by for a replacement and choose this model. I like it fine only I cannot mix up 4 loaves of bread at a time and am quite disappointed and I guess I should have bought the larger model.That is my fault not the companies. I have since cut my recipe in half and carry on baking. I have made cakes, cookies and bread since my purchase a month ago. It has lots of power and is easy to use. I would recommend this mixer to anyone."
4,Get this mixer!,"I've had this for a year and it's my favorite appliance. The Kitchenaid went to a son! I can find other ingredients while I have this one the timer. Bread is now snap (I'm in love with the dough hook). Everything can go in the dishwasher. The blender is awesome for blended drinks (Margaritas,Mojitos) the food processer is small (but mighty), be forwarned and I have yet get the texture correct for the pastamaker. (The only resons I couldn't give this a 5 star). I love the brushed chrome with my Deer Isle granite!"
1,Great...until it breaks,"I got this for my wife for Christmas 2010. She used it about 5 times (nothing ""heavy duty""...usually making frosting). After using it last weekend, it leaked something all over the counter (oil?). Today she plugged it in and there is no power going to the machine.So, she's sitting on hold with Cuisinart. Hopefully their CS is better than their product and we just got a lemon.*Update: I have to mail it in to Cuisinart along with a $20 check (for return shipping). The turnaround time is approx 6 week. So, their faulty product will cost me even more money. In all fairness, we order everything from Amazon and this is only the second ""dud"" we've encountered. However, I will be purchasing similar items from Costco...they would have accepted this return."
4,Short on promise,"The product itself is amazing, however, when purchasing from Amazon there was an advertisement saying I would get a coupon with the product for a free attachment. I haven't seen the coupon, and I am a little disappointed about that."
3,Burned up,"I bought my mixer 3 and a half years ago. Have been using it for cake and cookie doughs. The first time I use it for making bread, the darn thing starts to smoke and no longer works. Cuisinart has done nothing to honor their warranty (5 years on the motor). So I have a beautiful looking stand mixer that does not run. I guess I can use it as a timer. The most I've ever spent on bread in my life.No, I did not make more than the machine could handle. It just gave up the ghost. Will never buy from Cuisinart again for anything."
4,Mostly terrific,"Bought this mixer after comparing it to the ubiquitous KitchenAid Artisan. This mixer has a much more powerful motor. The two additional accessory attachment ports really open this machine up for much more than just standard mixing. The dough hook is particularly good -- yeast bread dough comes out quite nice. Machine doesn't feel as substantial as the Artisan, mainly due to the fact that the Cuisinart isn't completely made of metal. The Cuisinart seems to move a little more than you'd like when mixing heavy things like bread dough. I find the splash guard mostly useless. Overall, however, this is a very good machine at a good price. I am happy with this mixer, and use it often."
4,Fits nice under the cabinets,"We originally purchased the kitchenaid professional and it was too tall to slide under the cabinets on our kitchen counters. Instead of dropping down to the Artisan Kitchenaid we bought this Cuisenart instead. It operates every bit as well as the Kitchenaid with improvements with built in timers and the additional top access port for attachements. I will admit it doesn't seem as heavy duty as the Kitchenaid in construction, some of the parts seem plastic instead of the heavy metal of the kitchenaid but it is a lot easier to remove the beaters with the high tilt that this model provides. Hopefully the digital fetures hold up well."
5,Great stand mixer!,"After reading for days the reviews on Kitchenaid stand mixers and comparing product prices and reviews I decided to go with the Cuisinart 5.5 qt. stand mixer. I have no regrets. I am in love with this mixer. I find myself cooking and baking more. It kneads like a dream, whips in no time, easy to operate and clean it. It is a very good looking addition also to my kitchen."
5,My second favorite appliance,The kitchen appliance I use most often is still my food processor. This is the next most used. I love being able to turn it on and walk away (I've only had a hand mixer so this is a new experience for me.) I did a lot of research before purchasing this mixer and I have never been disappointed with Cuisinart products.
1,Did I get a lemon?,I used this item not more than 10 times since I bought it in September 2011. Now it's beginning to make a whirring sound while being operated. I have to find a Cuisinart service center here in the Philippines and hope to salvage the item. I'm beginning to regret not having bought a Kitchen Aid mixer instead.
2,Did not meet expectations,Dissapointing for a Cuisinart product.Did not do a very good job of mixing ingredientsLoud motorRubber pad on bottom of mixer would come off and mixer would wobbleWould not recommend this mixer
5,Mislabeled songs,"Beautiful music - it takes me back to my childhood and the LPs my Dad would play to wake us up on Christmas morning. One little problem - they switched the titles of ""It Came Upon The Midnight Clear"" and ""Joy to the World""."
5,S-O-N-I-C GO!!!!!,"This soundtrack is awesome for the anime series sonic x, but I haven't listened to all of the songs. I have to say that the ending theme called ""The shining road"" is a great song, and it has more of a sad tone. The opening song (Which I have no clue what it's called) is awesome since the music is neatly composed and it sounds very outgoing. Overall, I'd buy this cd, because the music is awesome to listen to."
3,Far fetched,"There are almost too many clichés in this book to make it believable, but it seems that the author received most of his material from his father who was a WWII veteran. I would like to know how much of the Hart's War is true form a WWII prisoner point of view. The bumbling Germans remind me at times of Hogan's Heroes, hiding radios in coffee cans and repeatedly shouting, ""There has never been an escape from Luftwaffe 13"". However, it is very interesting to learn of the day to day lives of WWII prisoners in a German camp, so the book is not a complete waste."
4,Sometimes slow...but worth the time to finish.,"A very enjoyable and informative read. I found the pace slow sometimes, but it is worth the time to finish it. It has caused me to look more into the POW camps and stories."
5,Hart's War,"Timothy Hart lost his B-25 over Germany in 1942 and is spending the rest of the war as a guest of the Third Reich in Stalag Luft 13. In 1944 Tuskeegee airman Lincoln Scott arrives in camp and is promptly accused of cutting the throat of smuggler Vincent Bedford. The prisoners demand a trial, their jailers agree, and ex-Harvard law student Hart is appointed to defend Scott, who appears inexplicably less than grateful.In fact their German jailers are more helpful to the defense than either Scott or the American officers, or so it seems, as Scott's trial for murder progresses against a backdrop of class conflict, racial hatred and world war. Atmospheric to the point of claustrophobia, a perfectly paced plot, and one of the few times I've been completely blindsided by a novel's climax.PS--The film adaptation starring Bruce Willis is truly gagworthy, stay away from it."
3,Another Racial Clash novel,Overall a pretty well written book; interesting in most respects but leaves a lot of questions with the reader about military protocol. Writers should avoid the venacular when they are not sure about it's use.Very distracting.
1,Vapid,"Cardboard characters, plastic thoughts. This dreadful thing is a 490-page lump of tedious, predictable pap. Makes John Grisham look good as a prose stylist. A nice book for yuppies who think wars are fought and won by lawyers and social workers. Bound to be a movie; perhaps that will be better. I strongly recommend that you wait for the movie to be made and then don't go to it."
5,Great Read!,Outstanding read! A very compelling book. It puts a new and interesting spin on WWII and POW's. I think someone has to already be planning a movie version. I don't know what else to say except that this is a 5-star book!
2,Yawned my way through it...I think it's a guy thing...,"I have complained of this writing trait before: the author continually repeats the full names of the characters when you know perfectly well who they are. Tom Hart, Thomas Hart, Tommy Hart. And the Germans - believe me, dear author, I got their names the first, second and third times. It was quite tedious to have them fully repeated over and over. I don't care how many books an author has published, this is the kind of thing that is blatantly amateurish. Where are these ""bestselling authors'"" editors?Sentimental slop. So very tired of the Noble White Man who helps the Downtrodden Black Man. Blagh. Why did I read it? (didn't finish it, but must take responsibility for slogging through three-quarters). Guess I was mesmerized by its many flaws. I wanted to see how often this writer was allowed to bungle. It reminds me of the recent New Yorker cartoon where the publisher is saying to the hopeful writer: ""Your book stinks. We want to publish it!"""
2,A Big Letdown,"I began this book with high hopes, as the plot set-up sounded particularly interesting. Unfortunately, the prose was turgid, cliche-ridden and imprecise. The grammar was bad. And the court scenes were embarassingly melodramatic, filled with ludicrous speeches that were intended to show the characters making cogent points, when in fact all they did was to wave the flag. This book was so intellectually flabby I was embarassed for the author. And I'm embarassed for the state of literature that so many reviewers seemed to think this bilge was compelling."
2,"Tedious, Plodding, and Riddled With Mistakes","I had a tough time getting through this one, as it was slow-paced to the point of putting me to sleep. Eventually I reached the point where I expected to find an anachronism, technical mistake, or violation of military protocol on every other page. For example, American pilots did not ""click their heels"" like Nazis when they saluted, as was repeated in the book many times. Nor did the dialogue between characters sound authentic to the period. I found it pretty much a waste of time and would not recommend it. Luckily mine was a library copy or else I'd have felt ripped-off."
1,from ridiculous to absurd,"Just when you come to the conclusion that the story is ridiculous, it's absurdity is taken to another level. Although license is not unusual in legal thrillers, and even though the rights of an accused in 1944 were not as constitutionally sculpted as today, the story line here is simply too unbelievable. To top things off, the book is not well written. It's my first and last Katzenbach novel."
5,"If you read only one book this year, make it ""Hart's War"".","Here's one that lives up to it's hype. I am not sure if this is the best book I have read this year, but I suspect it is. What I certain of, is that it is easily the most powerful book I have read thus far in 1999. Wonderfully deep characters, twists and turns that offer constant surprises, clear writing. After you live the lives of the main characters, the final chapter is especially moving. John Katzenbach is a marvelous writer. I know two of his novels have been made into movies. It would be great to see ""Hart's War"" make it to film."
5,A Great Read.,"Have you ever wanted to just become someone else? Ever had the feeling that you were meant to do something else with your life? Ever been bullied, and wished that just once you could fight back? If any of these themes grab you, then you need to get Able, Baker, Charley by John Maxim. This is one of those rare reads that just keeps getting better chapter by chapter. I noted that this excellent book has recently been re-released too, so should not be hard to find. I have reread this book a half dozen times, and will probably continue to do so until Mr. Maxim DOES A SEQUEL."
3,Good starting selection,"This book works if you want a no-nonsense, naturalistic approach to the basics of Buddhist texts. As such, this book has translations of texts relating to the Buddha's birth, enlightenment, the famous first sermon in the deer park and death. Mixed in are some varying stories with a moral basis as well as poetry such as the Formula for Welfare.Then again, this is a small book of the gift-book variety so don't expect great gems. A good focus on Buddhist texts as sources of wisdom rather than enlightenment."
5,"Excellent, colorful and insightful history of Lucrezia.","An A&E Network show on Lucrezia Borgia prompted me to search out this book. It was worth the search. Ms. Erlanger brings you right back to that colorful period of history, with great descriptions of some of the stranger common practices of the time. Anyone who believes ""family values"" is a thing of the past will find out otherwise here. Indeed Lucrezia has been maligned, and her father leaves a bit to be desired. Fascinating!"
2,Lucrezia Borgia: A Biography,"A very readabale book with more information (obviously) on Lucrezia than books about The Borgia in general. The author paints a lovely picture of Lucrezia, me-thinks maybe too much. The trouble with this family is they were so secretive it is impossible for anyone to know what is true and what is not. They didn't confide in people outside the family and never committed anything about their plots and plans to writing. Did this author learn more about Lucrezia than others who questioned her ""virtue"" or was he just partial to her? I remain drawn to learn more about Lucrezia and her family but that may only be realized by reading and researching more about 16th century Italy to glean what others from that time - who knew them had to say - people who actually left written documents at and of the time- such as Machiavelli, da Vinci, etc. So many books, so little time. Although I don't feel I garnered a lot of solid facts from this book, I did enjoy the read. The quest goes on!"
3,"A good main point, but not much value added in this book","I tend to agree with the main premise of this rather short book. But I don't feel the author adds enough ""meat"" to make the book the money. The most valuable part is a section on identifying ""exceptional individuals"" in job interviews. This material could have been put in a good-sized magazine article or essay. I didn't find the bulk of the book terribly useful, and (unlike the previous reviewer) I felt the anecdotes didn't add that much. I give it a ""3"" because I feel the main idea is valid, and because it does have at least one useful section. I can't go to 4 stars without more value than that, however."
5,beautiful film,"What a lovely, difficult, sad and funny film. Although it deals with very controversial issues and extreme circumstances, the characters come alive and seem very real, due to great writing and performances. With such a small cast and location, the actors get to stretch their muscles and fill the movie with their intensity and talent. I was very moved by the film, but still found myself laughing. Would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good writing and extraordinary acting."
2,Good intentions don't necessarily make a good film,"Yes, this is based on a true story. Yes, the filmmaker undoubtedly had the absolute best intentions. But no, sadly, the film isn't very good.Perhaps the filmmaker was too close to his subject, but FACADE suffers from a lack of clarity, direction, empathy, or understanding of the main character's plight and subsequent suicide. The characters of this film circle each other with murky intent, and a lack of forward motion in the film makes this a very long 89 minutes indeed, and the result, for me, was alot of guilt for being bored and frustrated in the face of obviously grave subject matter.The low-budget film's tech credits are admittedly a bit shakey, but not so much that if the acting, writing, and direction were working they would be a problem. The filmmaker's intent was certainly good, but unfortunately that isn't enough to end up with a good movie."
5,90-second Preview,Length:: 1:30 MinsI created a 90-second trailer of nine selected scenes to give you a preview.
1,waste of money!,I was extremely disappointed with this video. I didn't find it at all relaxing..and for the price I payed I was expecting something more spectacular. Don't waste your money.
4,nice,"A nice collection of dancehall goodies from Shaba Ranks, Cocoa Tea, et al, that will leave you wanting more of it. very danceable stuff, and well worth a listen."
5,Are you a white man?,"I didn't know what to think of this when I first recieved it in the mail. But after I finished reading it--while laughing outloud many a times--I know definitely what to think now: TALK RADIO is one of the funniest books I've read in ages.Despite the back blurb, this book doesnt not get bogged down in politics, and anyone who enjoys the stories of unlikely heroes and villians who get their just desserts, whould love this one.If Mark Gelbart continues to write in this vein, he could very well become the second coming of another Southern funnyman: Lewis Grizzard. Kudos mArk for a well-read book!"
3,Loved it until...,"We also LOVED our Krups panini maker, until, less than a year after purchase, the hinge at the back broke, meaning the lid flipped open the whole way when you opened it. We got another under warranty, but now, less than two years later, that one suddenly stopped working, too. Very disappointing for a product in this price range. We used ours about twice a week."
2,Loved it until it died.,We raved about making panini's. Introduced many of our friends to them. Then it died without warning in the middle of dinner. We paid $80 for the thing too!
1,Trips circuit breaker after 1 year,"After paying over $100 for this unit (at Williams Sonoma) I am very dissapointed that the unit has failed after just over 1 year. The symptoms I see are different than most of the complaints I see here. On my unit, it keeps tripping the circuit breaker as soon as I plug it in.While it worked, I was very happy with the results and it was easy to clean.I don't mind paying more for a premium product which was what I thought I was getting. Sadly, I need to replace this and it won't be another Krups unit."
3,Yes and No,"Though I love how this grill cooks, it is an absolute pain in the butt to clean. Since the grill part does not detach, the unit cannot be washed in the sink. This makes clean up of scorched cheese or onions or anything with a sugar in it very very hard to clean. If they made this unit with a detachable cooking surface, it would be much better. We love chicken or turkey burgers and this grill cooks them fast and even and never dry. But I HATE THE CLEAN UP THIS THING!"
1,Same problem - used it 20 times max,This panina maker lasted no more than 20 times max and I will be buying a different brand and model.Also the 2 lights (green light and red light) were either very confusing (I'm of at least average intelligence and normally have no problem figuring out appliances) or the two lights weren't working properly from the start as the lights made no sense as to when they were on or off.
5,Panini Maker is a hit.,"My purchase of the Panini Maker was a wise choice. I use it on the average of 3-4 times a week and when we had holiday company, they were pleased with it also. I also purchased one for my son, who uses it frequently as well."
1,Krups -- How can a good company make such a bad product?,"I had a great review posted here on Amazon for my Krups panini grill. Many people probably bought this product when they read my first review. We loved it at first.When I bought it, I saw all those negative reviews from people who said that theirs had stopped working. I laughed about their troubles while eating great panini sandwiches. Then, one day mine stopped working also, just like hundreds of others. In calling Krups, I got the run-around. I asked myself, how can a product that is so obviously designed poorly get on the market? Especially from a company like KRUPS with a good reputation?!Anyway, don't trust it. Yours will break as well. I guarantee it."
3,Flama Grill from Sur La offers more features...,"I cannot give a hands-on review this Krups, as I do not own one. However, I saw it being demonstrated in a Sur La Table store alongside the Flama Panini Grill. I bought the Flama. The Flama has more wattage (1600), removable drip tray, removable nonstick reversible grill plates (the other side is smooth), 5 heat settings for different types of food, a ""broiler"" feature to brown the tops of mini pizzas or cheeseburgers. None of these features are available on the Krups model. The Flama isn't as pretty to look at, but it does the job better. Go with the Flama."
5,PANINI PERFECTO,"Undoubtedly, the Earl of Sandwich never dreamed of these mighty little morsels that have crossed the ocean from Italy and are now found here in bistros and take-outs. Another good place to find them we've discovered is at home - if you have this Krups grill.Panini, as most know are delectable cheese and meat sandwichs (think prosciutto and mozarella) that are toasted on a grill, flattened to a slim configuration.This Krups grill has nonstick plates on both top and bottom, so it's easy-clean. Very much like all of the other Krups products I've used it is well made - no wobble (we have a waffle iron that appears to dance).And, it's multi-purpose - great for burgers, chicken breasts.Kudos to Krups for this one!"
2,Loved it until it stopped working -- twice,"We were quickly addicted to our Krups Panini Maker and used it at least daily for 2-3 months until it died. We didn't do anything harmful to it, just plugged it in one day, and there was no heat and the indicator lights failed to come on. We took it to the nearest Krups customer service center some 50 miles away. They replaced a ""thermo fuse"". We were thrilled to pick it up after a couple of weeks and bring the Krups back home so we could enjoy some more great sandwiches. Unfortunately it died again a little over a month later. Now I'm hoping that Krups will refund our money.We've always enjoyed Krups products, and enjoyed this one too -- when it worked."
1,Do not buy this product!,"Okay, so it was a great product WHILE IT LASTED! Purchased it about 6 months ago and used it for grilling lots of things - it was a permanent fixture on my countertop! Used it approximately 2-3 times per week, then it decided to (without warning) take a dump last night in the middle of grilling panini! Apparently, lots of others have had the same problem, so clearly a flaw with the product. Given the numerous choices now on the market (many with removable parts for easier clean-up), do yourself a favor and skip this product!"
1,Broken after 7 months,"Like so many others, it just up and stopped working (tonight) after 7 months.Prior to tonight it had been absolutely great, although the lack of an off switch is kind of lame. I saw a Wolfgang Puck panini press on TV that looked cool. Stood on its side when not in use and had an on/off button."
1,Another dead soldier,"after mine failed (I troubleshot it down to a little in-line thermal fuse-a 1 cent part if you can find it), I was amazed to see all the other failure reviews in this forum. I called Krups customer service (""we're sorry sir, we have a one-year warranty and you have no proof of purchase"") and mentioned all the failures I read about. The Krups rep said that this product has actually been a good one for them. Wow - I'd hate to see the reviews on the bad ones. Don't even think about buying this product. But, I do love panini!!!"
2,Pannini press failures,We brought 2 machines which worked great until they just stopped heating. One after 3 months and one after 1 month. Did nothing except plug them in and no go. Will not buy a third.
5,Best panini grill on the market,"We've looked at quite a few panini makers; from the inexpensive brands to the mega models, and have found the Krups panini grill to be the best one for us. (It gets a LOT of use)It's a heavy duty unit and is incredibly easy to clean. I read two comments from people here who didn't like their panini maker- stating that it broke shortly after they purchased it.We've had ours at least 14 months, use it 2 or 3 times a week, and it works perfectly. Since we bought the Krups panini maker on Amazon, we've seen Alton Brown (Good Eats) and Giada (Everyday Itialian) use the same grill on their shows and they are impressed as we are. There's also some good books out there with assorted panini recipes, but once you own one .. you'll find yourself coming up with all sorts of your own creations.These are GREAT!Good deal, excellent product, stellar brand."
3,good while it lasted,"ah... my short lived love affair with this panini press was good (no, great) while it lasted. it made delicously crisp sandwiches and was truly my favorite appliance. then, one day, not even a year later, it simply stopped working. i plugged it in and -- well -- nothing. very disappointing for such an expensive piece. i wouldn't recommend this product unless you have a back-up plan."
3,Mine just broke!!! :(,"I absolutely loved this panini press and used it at least several times per week (if not more!) until it just all of a sudden died yesterday. After reading all the other reviews, I now know that this is an ongoing problem with this product.While it was working, it cooked everything really well -- nice and even, and sandwiches were delicious, too. The major issue I have with this panini maker (other than it breaking after 2 years!) is that it's a huge PAIN TO CLEAN. If you cook anything even remotely greasy on this thing, you will be trying to clean it off for HOURS. It's a total nightmare!Overall, the food turns out great, the product breaks after a while, and it sucks to clean. I'm looking to another brand for a replacement."
1,Keeps Breaking,Both my sister and I purchased this machine at the same. Both machines had to be returned 3 months after purchase. I am on my second machine and this one just died. This is the same problem I and my sister had. I believe this machine has a design flaw or a defect.
2,Good while it lasted,"I loved our panini grill. Unfortunately it lasted for less than 3 months and as it was a gift they didn't honor the warranty (no proof of purchase). For the few weeks it worked it was great. But overall, not worth the money because you'll have to replace it in 3 months."
2,Stops Working for No Apparent Reason,"Great product until it unexpectedly stops working. Apparently this is a well known and documented problem. Surprised Krups hasn't found a fix. Tried to have it repaired but the estimate came to $72.98 not including the postage to get it to the repair center. Feel guilty wasting all of that cast iron, I hope the repair center melts it down for recycling."
2,Sudden death; lousy customer service,"We loved this grill, while it worked. We bought it less than 2 years ago from amazon, and used it lightly- some weeks not at all. It just stopped working a few days ago while grilling bread. Customer service was firm in their refusal to do anything about it, denying any problems with the product, even though I brought up all the negative reviews here on amazon. The rep said they would have no way of knowing about that because they don't have contact with amazon. But, she wasn't willing to research those reviews either.Out of principle, we won't be purchasing a Krups product again."
2,My unit broke after 1.5 years of use,"I am writing a new product review for this Krups panini maker in that my unit recently broke after 1.5 years. I thought it was a great panini maker which I used probably 2X a week. It appears that the unit somehow burned itself out last week. Of course it only comes with a 1 year warranty so I cannot get it replaced.As I said in my other review, there really is no reason to pay the premium for the Krups maker when there are many other generic brands that make panini grills just as well for half the price. I will be purchasing a cheaper unit because unlike pots and pans, if you pay more it does not necessarily mean that it will last longer."
1,Flat or ridged plates?,"I don't own this item but I'm interested in it, enough to write a review!Does it come with flat plates or ridged plates? The photos show both but the copy makes no mention of it nor do any of the other reviewers.Had to rate it -1 star- otherwise the system doesn't accept the review."
3,No shut off switch?!,"I have had the Krups Panini Grill for several years but have not used it more than about a dozen times. It worked well whenever i used it. i just can't understand that it does not have a switch to turn it on or off. I always have to plug it into the electrical outlet and unplug it to turn it off. That's more then inconvenient, it is plain dumb. May be the newer models have been changed and come with a switch.Krups FDE312-75 Universal Grill and Panini Maker"
1,"great grill, until it mysteriously dies...","I was loving this panini grill and used it weekly for about four months until it died. It worked just long enough for me to throw away all the packaging and receipts...I couldn't even remember where I had purchased it.So without being able to return it, I took it apart to see what the problem was. It has a thermal fuse that breaks if the grill temperature gets too high, and once it breaks, you have to replace the fuse. It would be a simple repair, but the exact fuse is not easy to find. I recommend passing on this grill until they fix this design problem."
1,mine died too....,"I bought this panini machine last Christmas and it worked wonderfully for about 4 months, and then it just went dead one day - it would not heat up. So I called Krups and they kindly gave me a few addresses to send my machine in for repairs, and I did. Except it has been 6 months now since it has been sitting there in the shop, because the ""part"" is on backorder... and they don't even know when or if they will ever receive the ""part"". I find it to be very frustrating! I am going to receive my broken machine back now and hopefully I will be able to return it to Krups. I'm not quite sure if after all this trouble I want another one. :("
1,Died mysteriously after using it twice,"Makes wonderful panini...too bad I only got to use it twice. The third time, I plugged it in and it simply would not turn on. It was a gift and I have found it difficult to get Ace Hardware to replace it rather than having to return it for a refund without being reimbursed for the return shipping. Buyer beware -- not only is this grill evidently prone to problems, but trying to exchange it will turn out to be inconvenient and exasperating."
4,Panini maker,"I really enjoy cooking with this panini maker. I had another brand and food spilled out the sides, this one doesn't. Fairly easy to clean as well. Optimally I would like the grills to be removable for easier cleaning but this isn't so bad. This is a good purchase for a fair price and I recommend it."
3,"Works, but red light cover was broken and fell off after the 2nd use.","Works, but red light cover was broken and fell off after the 2nd use. Also, does not remain closed when the side catch is engaged."
2,Disappointed,"I checked reviews here and in Consumer Reports and decided to get this grill. I am disappointed in that it does not contain a feature allowing grease to drain away from the food. If you cook hamburger patties you should expect them to emerge sodden with grease, as if you had immmersed them in a pail of it. It may be good for panini and even for lean meats but not for my hamburgers. It also does not allow the grills to be removed for cleaning.I wish I had made another choice.Jerry"
1,Really liked...but,"Best of the panini makers...until it died unexpectedly and without warning within 5 months of purchase. Based on other reviews, not an uncommon problem. Stay away"
3,Mine also broke!!!,"If you leave it unattended for several minutes, it will burna fuse (like mine did this week), which Krups don't replace but I'm hopeful that I will be able to fix using the tips in the Waine,March 3, 2000 review."
1,Lasted 2 weeks,"I bought the Krups for my son at college. It lasted two weeks before it stopped working. After having a Krups coffee maker die prematurely last year, I feel that they are no longer making products that are consistent with their good reputation.I would have rated this item ""0 stars"" but that was not an option."
1,Use caution,"Krups Universal Panini grill with slide locking unit is not a secure lock. I picked it up by the handle and it was not completely locked. It sprung open and snaped off the two very small raised edges on the back corners that keep the lid at a 90 degree open position to allow you to put a sandwich on the grill. It is a white metal and is not fixable. This is an expensive unit to be so easily broken. So use caution when handling this unit. As a Panini Grill, it works well. The plates are not removable though. I would not buy another without removable plates."
2,"A must-have, but......","I would give it a 5-star rating, except for the fact that mine died after just over 1 year. It was not abused or overused. Sob, best kitchen gadget I ever owned."
4,"Beautiful,but too hot to handle!","I love the look of this grill. It heats up quickly and makes great sandwiches. I haven't tried any other foods yet as I bought this just for the those great italian style grilled sandwiches. The only problem is, make sure you put it exactly where you are going to be useing it, because the base gets extremely hot!. Beware if you have children."
1,oye no goood,"I've had mine for over a year and the lid has always stuck, now the heating element doesn't work... so it has been only a headache. Good when it worked... but hey. krups = kr*ps"
1,Big Useless Chunk of Metal,"We've never owned a panini grill before, and have enjoyed this product. Not only did make paninis more tasty than paninis in restaurants, but it was useful for grilling vegetables and fish. It was to our disappoint that our grill died in about 7 months of only light use. We sent to the service center and after a wait of about 2 months we received a new grill. We are hoping it will last longer than the previous one."
2,"Loved it, but mysteriously dead","I have owned this panini grill for about 9 months and used it regularly. I loved every sandwich and grilled meat that I cooked in it. But one Saturday, I plugged it in as usual to make my favorite grilled cheese and it was dead, although it had worked perfectly well the day before."
2,Just Fair!,"I was really looking forward to reading this book after having read many of the glowing reviews. While Jim Fusilli is an author with potential I was largely disappointed in Closing Time, his first effort. The basic premise is interesting and Fusilli's descriptive abilities of the sights and sounds of New York strongly ring true. However, the plot is too drawn out and Fusilli seems unable to forego describing all the thoughts and feelings of his main character, Terry Orr. By the time I got through the first quarter of Closing Time (about 75 pages), I was spending as much time thinking about what to read next as on the story itself. Closing Time is not a bad book, it's just not an especially good one. If you're into reading the first works of authors with promise, than Closing Time might be worth your time -- but buy in paperback, or better still, get it from the library. Otherwise, since there are so many books and so little time, I'd suggest you skip this book."
4,Closing Time by Jim Fusili,"Great first novel. Right on with characterizations. Tight, smooth sentence structure. Descriptive pasages paint a brilliant picture"
5,A beautiful read!!!,Closing time is beautifully written. Feel this author has a major novel in him. Liked the Manhattan background for the plot. The author obviously had a intimate knowledge of New York that he shared with the reader in a special way. The main character's relationship with his daughter is special. Note that the author dedicates the book to two women. Sure one is his wife and one his daughter. One has to have had a real Father/Daughter relationship to write about one like Mr Fusilli did. Would recommend the book highly to anyone who enjoys great descriptive writing.
3,Ceiling Tiles 12 x 12,The price was very good until shipping was added and it went up $50.00. The tiles appeared to have holes in them but they were just ridges....I was trying to match some old tiles that broke.
2,The cover of the book arrived me is different from the picture showed in website.,The author and the title of the book is what I want. But the cover of the book is different from the picture of amazon showed me when I placed the order and thus is different from the one my teacher asked. So I think the edition I got is not what I ordered.
3,okay raggae music,terry linen sounds like a maxey priest wannabe. He should develop his own style.It is okay overall.
2,Not satisfied,"These torx bits are not best suited for heavy automotive repair work. The very first time my husband used the bits they bent their shape and started to slip while in use. Shipping however, was on time"
5,Doesn't get more precise than this.,"""Writer's Encyclopedia"" is a must for any writer who's questions go unanswered for lack of someone who KNOWS. The people at Writer's Digest know what they're talking about, and the dictionary style referencing is perfect. This book is like having a professional right there beside you whenever you need them."
1,WTF!?!?,"Awful, this is one of the worst movies ever made. NL was once the mecca of amazing comedies, but now they are far from it, they make crude and mean jokes about other films and directors while THEY make movies like this one. Year One has the same idea and was truly brilliant, this however is a low budget, camp filled piece of garbage."
3,It has it's moments,This movie has a lot of very funny moments and had a ton of potential. It almost feels like they rushed to finish the last third and didn't develop the humor there. Could have been a home run...instead fly out.
1,Literally the worst movie I've ever seen,"Hands down the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I sat through the whole thing thinking that maybe, just maybe, there would be some redeeming quality about it. That it would at least be funny or interesting or something.I was dead wrong, from start to finish it was a boring and pathetic look at an idiot's life.To this movie I say:What you've just shown me is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever seen. At no point in your rambling, incoherent storyline were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational and interesting narrative. Everyone involved in this movie is now dumber for having seen it. I award you no stars, and may God have mercy on your soul.If this comes on TV, maybe Comedy Central, and you're bored enough to watch it. Change the channel, do something else, because there are a million things that would be better than watching this film."
2,Silly T and A stuff,"Like most comedies with shallow plots, this one treats you to some silly bathroom humor fit for young boys approaching sexual maturity. Would have been great had I been in 8th grade and filled the room with my giggling buddies but beyond the T and A shots, it leaves you wanting for the humor. Rifkin actually thought this was funny?? I think he could have done a lot better. It will be on my next yard sale table."
3,Pre-historic splash,"In a sarcastic form moviemakers have embedded a very notion of their surrounding which is jealousy and hatred of creative people if, especially, their out-of-a-grey-crowd natural stand does not fit social place they supposed for.During ninety minutes authors leave a little non-satirised, whether it is nudism, same gender issues, feminism or family affairs.Female nudity traditionally representing a top of aesthetic pleasure in modern civilised societies, is of a questionable apprehension while exhibited on a screen abundantly. Perhaps, a less popular title ""National Lampoon's Homo Erectus"" transparently poinits at authors' idea.Not much miracles surround real people in a real life, and a major character forced down a cliff to only become a ""typical pre-historic specimen"" in the museum of a natural history erected circa two million years since his story had occurred.In any case, this work is much better than both ""300and ""Meet the Spartans"", surely."
5,look closer to home first,"Put this in my wish list and the next day found it for under $16.00 at the local Lowes store, not the $25.00 Amazon price."
3,Easy to use,"I purchased this mold to do a walkway to my porch. It was fairly easy to use, I done it all by myself. My only concern was that I was not completely happy with the crevices between the rocks. It looks really pretty. However, if you have a pair of heels on and step in one of those cracks, you have big problems. So to remedy the situation, I tried filling in with sand, which looked dirty. Then I took a mortar piping bag and just piped some mortar in between each stone. It looks ok, but now it catches all the dirt in the cracks and constantly looks dirty. So, I now spend much of my time spraying my walkway to keep it clean looking."
4,Very cool,"I really dug this release. It's a great mix of downtempo electronic music, some classics and some really dope underground mixes. It's compiled and mixed by DJ Jimmy Cohrssen - Jacky Jayet did Vol. I of this series. I liked Vol. I too - and Cohrssen adds some hot insight. The record moves along really smoothly and seamlessly - it's nice to hear some intelligent mixes and gems. Cohrssen covered all the bases with grace. Definitely check it out."
5,Enjoy a fascinating saga with Superior Home Video,"This is a great video! This is the fascinating saga of the return of the wolves to Yellowstone and Jasper National Parks. Follow wolves on the hunt during the deep snows of winter, and marvel at the clever ways in which the wary wapiti protect their calves. The age old drama between prey and predator unfolds in the scenic splendor of the Rocky Mountains. This video lasts 25 minutes."
2,So So,I didn't really like this. I realize the author is highly honored in his own country and far be it from me to say he's not good. All I can say is that this book wasn't my cup of tea.
2,a most difficult read,"Okay, I've been trying to think of something positive to write about concerning this novel ""The Book of Fathers"" written by Hungarian author Miklos Vamos. The only thing that comes to mind is that he is well-renowned in his country. Try as I might, I just could not get interested in this saga of the family patriarchs/first-born sons and all that it encompassed! Actually, I was expecting a lot more about the mysterious, mystical golden watch that brings a gift of clairvoyance to the first-born sons.....that caught my attention! Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the watch was just a blip in the storyline. Sad to say that I have been totally unable to grasp the meaning, history, intention, whatever...of this book. Obviously, this type of novel translated from it's original language is just not my thing! I gave it a 2 star rating mostly for any other adventurous readers that would have no problem with this type of read."
2,I tried to like this book,"I read so many great things about this book, and I really wanted to like it myself but sadly could not. I am a voracious reader of both fiction and non-fiction, reading 60-90 books year. I have enjoyed other stories similar to this that jump around in time, and change voice depending on the character who is narrating at any given moment, however, I was never able to connect with any of the characters in this book and gave up after 100 pages. I believe the story may have suffered from a bad translation, as I was unable to enjoy an English-language version of War and Peace until I found a good translation."
1,Unreadable.,"I can't say if it's terrible writing or terrible translation, but this book is unreadable. Words pile together in unintelligible heaps of nonsense, obscuring anything that might resemble a story."
5,Imaginative and historical,"Fascinating and imaginative, but also based on centuries of Hungarian history. Well researched and well written. Highly recommended for a good overview of generations. Recommended as a good 'read' and for travelers going abroad. Good family tree for reference. Interesting that he wrote the first three chapters in the style of, and with known Hungarian words during, those eras... and the book became 'more modern' as time went on."
3,like a hungarian history lesson,"This book takes some concentration as you jump from generation to generation, location and circumstance, surname and siblings. It was a good book but rather depressing as tragedy strikes more often than not. Not my cup of tea but not a waste of time either. I certainly know a lot more about Hungary than I did before!"
4,A good history of the towers and New York,"I haven't finished it yet, but it basically gives the history of how skyscrapers came to be in New York, and eventually evolved into the World Trade Center. Only the last part of the book deals with 9/11, and it's clear that this book was put together pretty soon after the tragedy. I think it came out within a couple of months of 9/11. But nonetheless, it's an interesting, easy read for anyone who wants to learn about the towers and their evolution and meaning to the city."
5,Plug-in to Paradise,"This is not another travelogue. It was like going someplace beautiful and slowing down enough to just be there. What I really liked was how fresh the visuals were. The camera didn't just take you on the typical tourist trip through another tropical paradise - It explored the kind of small, quiet intimacies I've only been able to experience on travels where I've had the luxury to ease my pace and really let a place become a part of me."
3,"Great scenes, limited sound, limited time.","This is a great DVD, beautiful scenes in hi-res but the sound disappointed me. The editors could have done a better job and avoided repetitive sounds like the same bird chirps over and over again. Besides that, the video only lasts 40 minutes."
4,Good for the price,"Despite some of the other reviews, the picture quality is ok. It is not high def, but as a background visual in the living room it is fine. Brought back memories of our trip there, which is really just what I wanted. Although with today's DSLR and even compact cameras shooting HD video, one could probably put together a similar or better quality montage of the island - if you have the time and your hands are still steady after a mai-tai or two."
1,Disappointed,"The video was not what I expected. I am planning a vacation to Bora Bora and was expecting to find an interesting, informative video that would provide an overview of the Island and highlight local attractions, things to do, etc. Instead, the video was boring and viewed the same stretch of beach, with waves rolling over and over. I finally just turned the video off. I would not recommend."
5,Amazing love story,"I love this story so much! Christine Rimmer has written a lot of books about the Bravo family but this is one book from the series that I truly enjoyed. Wonderful chemistry between the two protagonists, I must say. The plot is not very original but going through the process of reading their story is just so delightful. Two thumbs up!"
3,sure if you say so,i live in the north west it rains almost all the time so of course when i seen this i jumped on it. i have used rain-x before and this says it works longer then rain-x. well it dont.
1,Crap,This stuff is total crap!! dont waste any of your money!! go to the store and buy rain-X way cheaper and works better and last longer....
2,Simply didn't work,"I probably didn't apply it correctly, even though I carefully read and followed the instructions. They should definately improve the directions because I still don't know what I did wrong.I'd give it another try, maybe this time spending more time in applying lots of layers of it."
3,OK - Product,I used Rainx previously and then i tried this. i think that Rainx works as well and it is easier to purchase at the store than order this and wait for the same to come in by mail.
3,Not what it appears to be,I ordered 4 of these andthey do not come with theretail packaging!! Theyonly provide the jar it-self!!
1,useless,"After years of using Rainex, Aquapel was recommended to me so I tried it. The order arrived quickly, and I was excited to use it as rain was in the forecast. I followed instructions perfectly, even washing, rinsing and drying my windshield first. It seemed to go on just as expected, although the amount was skimpy and it didn't seem to be quite enough to finish the passenger side of the windshield. The next day I was excited to get in my car in the rain, expecting great things. I looked at my windshied, staring in disbelief. It didn't look any different than before i had applied it! What a waste. I will go back to using Rainex."
2,Just didn't work.,"Gave this a shot for my motorcycle helmet visor, and after just getting back home out of the rain, I can't say this product works. At all. I followed the directions that came with it, but for whatever reason the rain didn't bead off my visor. If anything it actually seemed to stick on more. I think I'll stick with the Raincoat stuff."
5,"Better than ""Rain-X""","This stuff is great! It is a lot better than the other products out there.I haven't used my wipers since I applied it to my windshield and front side windows. (Also works great on 'GLASS' headlights and housings)I highly recommend this product.Drawbacks: Application rates about a '3.5' ('10' being hardest), you have to get your windshield VERY clean before you apply this product. I suggest a razorblade and ""Palmolive"" dish soap."
1,Did Not Cover As Advertised,The Aquapel window treatment was very disappointing. When applied exactly as directed there was not near enough product to cover our Sienna windshield. By the time I got to the passengers half of the front windshield the pad was dry. Highly recommend you not buy this product.
1,Krups = Kraps,"Well if I could give it zero starts I would. The timer knob felt cheap from the start and within 3 weeks, it was done. Broken, and like an idiot I didn't have the receipt. Krups said tough luck and I say, I'll never buy Krups again.Poor quality!"
2,"Decent, but just dropped dead","Its almost like there is a warranty timer built into this unit. The day after, it simply stops working. It is a so so toaster, but not great. The rotary knobs and timers are sort of junky. But now, as it no longer works 1 year and 1 day after we bought it, and Krups will not fix it, I will no longer buy another Krups product as long as I live. They are aweful."
1,Total JUNK,"I received this as a Christmas gift last year, and it broke within 3 weeks; the cheap timer blew a circuit, and I ended up throwing the unit out. A relative got the exact same product, and his TOO broke within three weeks. I'd never touch a Krups product again. It is obvious that this company pulled a fast one on the unsuspecting public. Never again, though."
1,poor quality toaster,"I have had this item for 1 year and 2 months. It has just stopped working. I only use it a few times a week (making toast). I always clean it, and I have always babied it. Now, the power works, but the elements quit heating up. I should have bought a $12 toaster rather than this piece of junk. It doesnt toast properly (burns one side or under toasts both - take your pick). Dont buy this oven. If you do, dont say I didnt warn you."
1,"Krups, you gotta be kidding!","After being in storage for over a year, waiting to move into our new house, this toaster oven unit succeeded in lasting for only 5 months. Due to the length of time that it was stored, the warranty has run out and I see no reason to try and fix it. The dials are impractical and the oven racks misaligned. Toast came out fine, but now the heating unit doesn't work on the top or bottom. Look at the overall sales ranking in Kitchen and Home for this item! In the 30,000s at the time of this review. Let the buyer beware! There are better toaster ovens out there. I am going for the Cuisinart Classic - 5 stars and #80 ranking."
1,Piece of JUNK,"I bought this toaster oven thinking that KRUPS built quality small appliances - I was WRONG. Piece of junk. As many of the other reviewers of the Krups 297, mine lasted just over the warranty period then died. The heating elements don't come on at all. Worthless."
2,I dont like this knife,"I took this knife to the boundary waters in 2010 and 2011. It is not a good knife. I regret not buying something with better quality. I used it on Pike and Crappie. The knife worked fine on the Crappie, but it was terrible on Pike. PIKE are slimey and the knife handle does not have any grip. I cut myself twice. Also the knife is not very flezible for removing skin. I let others use it and they did not like it either. I do love my Gerber hatchet though. That is a tough mother!!"
1,dull edge out of box,"Ive worked in sushi for several years, food industry for almost 10 years, and fish my whole life. Just bought 2 cheep fillet knives at bass pro shops including this knife just to see if either was decent. I pride myself on finding quality alternatives on the cheep.I was delightfully surprised by the American Angler ""9 fillet as it was deviously sharp out of box. However I was conversely very disappointed by this knife. I had to look to make certain the factory didn't forget to put an edge on it.If you want a good fillet knife, I suggest that American Angler 9"" for oh so cheep. And the victorinox 7-1/2"" fillet if you're only working in the kitchen"
1,waste of money,worst fillet knife i have ever bought. it looks nice and has a nice grip but will not fillet fish at all.
1,A complete waste of money,"I was hoping this DVD would have some information on Cyprus. Actually, it is a home video of several beaches around Cyprus. No commentary. No subtitles. Just video of waves hitting the beach that could have been filmed anywhere. A complete waste of time and money unless you are into ""New Age"" videos. I have no idea what the point of this DVD is."
1,Bad choice,I bought this bed for my badly arthritic dog thinking it was portrayed by the company as athickly stuffed cuddle bed. It is NOTHING like that. As the dog gets in and out the whole bed rolls and tilts as if it is on uneven surface. No matter where I put it the dogs won't lay in something that rolls everytime they move an inch. I would NOT recommend this type of bed at all.
5,Electronics Book,"Very interestingAnother great book by master McComb. A must have if you follow Gordon.It may not be new, but it's valuable."
1,Out-dated crap from TAB,"In typical TAB fashion, this book is a real find IF you can locate the materials used in these projects. I suppose an electronic experimenter that has a large outbuilding loaded with ancient parts could do well with this information, but I don't see where any of these projects is worthwhile to someone looking for something fun to do. Sorry TAB,,, I should have known from past experience."
5,Lovely,I recieved these as a ten year anniversery gift they are wonderfull! They sparkle and are just the right size for everyday wear!
5,Does the job,This is my second Remo 8 inch tamborine. The first one lasted me over ten years the metal chimes finally wore thru the rod that holds them and the chimes started to fall out. This is a good tamborine if your playing loud rock music. I use a rhythm-tec tamborine when I accompany softer music such as ballads. One tamborine can't do it all.
3,"Well made, but very bright","Seems durable and no complaints on the fit and finish. The jingles are very bright, so a light touch goes a long way. However, the sound lacks the depth of copper or bronze, so this instrument is not suited to playing in a large acoustic ensemble. Finger rolls are possible but not particularly easy on the plastic drum head."
4,An excellent piece of research!,This book documents the sobering effects on the environmentof the new global economy. It documents a troubling future pricethat our children and grandchildren will pay for the North'sindifference today.An outstanding piece of research!
1,Horrible very independent,"No Stars not even one from this movie, but I'm gonna be nice and give one star for effort. The actors and actresses werent even trying to act.You are sooo right, whomever did the first comment. The movie was nothing like I thought. At all. The plot was all screwed up. I thought it was about her getting with another guy because of her boyfriend sexual performance, and possibly going back to him at the end, it was about that, but there was some scenes where you're like, where the heck did this come from? (I'm talking about the brother killing the sister's husband, and the mother getting beat up. That was a little extra. The only thing that was important was when the girl thought she was going to get over on her man and she ended up being screwed by another guy. Very bad. Sad scene. Ended off sad. but I would not tell anyone about this movie. At all. Not all-independent movies are bad. But this movie was."
5,For Thy Love Review,Astounding! I enjoyed all of the movie. Wonderfully done. This writer should be in Hollywood. I loved everything about it.
1,Dialing is pathetically slow,"This phone is driving me crazy with slow dialing, and needing several attempts to make a connection. Do not buy."
1,Hate It.,"I got this phone as a replacement for my Uniden TRU-8886 2 line handsfreeThings I hate about this phone:You cannot mute the HandsetYou can store 20 phone numbers in the handset; you can only store 10 of ""speed dial"" numbers in the base (that you have to program separately)The Names in the address book are limited to 15 uppercase charactersName/Number phone book entry is abhorant, and times out quickly, losing entry-in-progressThere is no End/Cancel Key on the handset. You press and hold PROG to cancel.The headset jack is on the side of the handset, but in the center, making carrying while connected awkwardI would not recommend buying this phone, and will probably replace it with another of the uniden tru-line."
3,"Ok product, nothing special though",If you need a basic speakerphone + cordless phone this one is ok. Not as good as Panasonic though.
1,interrupted phone calls,This phone does not let you know when a phone line is in use from outside its system. The only way to know if a line is in use is to pick up the line and listen for traffic. This may have the effect of killing the other call.
1,"Expendable, even if you don't want it to be",Do you like throwing your phone away every year to replace it with a newer model? With the VTech 5879 you're wait will be even shorter! I don't know why I replaced the original purchase of this phone (Jan. 07) with the exact same one (Aug. 09) but the bottom line is that the usable life went from 18 months to half that time. Despite replacing the battery and cleaning the contacts the handset will simply not charge. Result? No more Vtech phones for me.
3,Decent cd... Nothing too special.,"I won this CD from a radio station. It's a decent CD. I think they can be compared best to a more mature Blink 182. All of the songs have a pretty similar fast, high-pace beat. There are a few catching choruses.This type of 'pop' music isn't exactly my favorite, so I'm probably not the best to review this. If you're into that type of music, though, I would recommend this cd if you can find it for a good price.Average cds would get a 2.5/5 stars, but this one is slightly better (not much) than average, so I give it 3/5. :)"
4,Portrays the life of a mangrove,"Most striking is the artwork. The pictures are truly very engaging and magical, even for a three year old. The story told by the drawings themselves is most compelling--simply the life of a mangrove (tangle) over many years and through many storms (harboring many animals). The story shows how it sprouts from a floating seed. Very relevant book for anyone visiting or living near mangroves. The text is nice too; however, too dry for a small child. I give it four rather than five stars because I felt the text could have been more engaging."
5,Beautiful Watch!,Incredible value for the money. Real sharp looking watch that works as well as it looks! Only suggestion is to have bezel move without increase in price.
5,Stellar product,"If you need a ""hot plate"" this is your buy! Turn it on, select ""high"" and it is HOT in less than three seconds! It is quiet, sleek and effective with a 9.5 inch ceramic heating plate with a 1/8 inch lip around it. Yes, it beeps three quick beeps every ten seconds for about fifteen minutes after it is turned off. Considering how well it works, I'll ignore the beeps. The gradient temperatures are perfect. I've tried several ""hot plates"" and most are just plain pathetic. I don't want to wait 20 minutes to try to fry an egg. Seriously, the other hot plates were pathetic. The Aroma plate just works very well."
5,This works great! Cook anything you would cook on a stove!,"This unit is sturdy and well built. It works great. I first tested it with about 4 cups of water in a medium saucepan, turned it on high. The water was boiling in less than 5 minutes. This unit is powerful enough to actually cook on, not just keep food warm. I am using it just like you would a stove burner, works as fast as a gas burner and faster than the usual electric burner. Turns up or down easily and readjusts the temp quickly. Since, I have an electric frying pan, I don't use it for frying, but I see no reason why that wouldn't work as well using an aluminum skillet. At 10"" across, it is large enough to use my big soup pot on. One really nice feature is the ""hot"" warning. After you turn it off, it beeps until it is cold again. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a hotplate that will actually cook."
4,"Fun, easy read","This was a fun, easy book to read. To me was in the ""Bridget Jones"" class where the heroine is not perfect but super cute and sweet. There was a lot of Millie's internal dialogue, which surprisingly didn't get too annoying. Interesting characters abounded and most were very likeable. The wacky but not implausible situations made it fun. I knew there would be happily-ever-afters for Millie, Orla and Hester but that didn't take away from the journey there. It's definitely more ""chick lit"" than a traditional romance novel but it's perfect for the beach."
2,Not worth reading if you like romance,"I bought this book on my Kindle expecting it to be a romance and I was mistaken. Although Millie is clearly the main character most of the story revolves around the people around her. Millie and Hugh, her love interest, spend the entire book, up until the last chapter, denying their feelings and avoiding each other. Their interactions at time seemed childish.I have also read many books set in different countries around the world and this was the first time I felt like I couldn't picture myself there. So if you don't live in or have visited London and the surrounding areas, don't expect to feel like you have after reading this book.The only reason I gave it two stars was because I have read worse books."
1,"Boring story, ditzy characters","The life of a single Cornish twenty-something.Nothing about this book caught my interest. Millie and her roommate Hester are both man-obsessed, with heads as empty as their wallets. Millie's friendship with the writer had potential but the writer turned out to be as ditzy as anyone else. The men in the story weren't worth pursuing. I forced myself to read the first quarter of the book, hoping something interesting would come up, but it didn't."
1,Funny?,I could not get into this book at all. I love a funny romance but this book did not make me laugh. I could not finish this book and am happy it was free.
1,"Boring, could not finish book.","It is rare that I can not finish a book, but I did not enjoy this book at all. I kept hoping for it to get more interesting. It was too fragmented. Most if the characters were not interesting. The book did not seem to have a consistent story theme. It was like a mash of different people's diaries that did not lead anywhere interesting. I am disappointed I wasted my money."
4,Great fling of a read,"I also got this book free on Kindle, and I think I will be checking out more of Jill Mansell's books. I enjoyed the almost screwball comedy in Millie's Fling. There was more substance there than I expected based on it being a free book and based on the title. I was reminded a bit of Bridget Jones, but I thought Millie was more likeable than Bridget."
3,Cute story & a quick read,"Although the story is pretty predictable, I found myself unable to put this one down. It's been ages since I've read a nice piece of chick lit with a happy ending and I forgot how enjoyable they can be. This isn't the type of book that will stay with you long after you finish it, but if you like the genre, you won't be disappointed."
4,Fun Read!,"What a fun READ! Millie is a blast and so is her roommate and friend, Hester! I was laughing right up to the end. There were some serious parts, but on a whole, this is a fun, cute, and entertaining book!"
5,My First Jill Mansell Book,"I'm not really a fan of romance novels, but the blurb sounded good and I decided to get it for my Kindle. Bad move, since I bought it late in the evening and just had to take a peek before bed. I finished it before I went to sleep that night!The writing is fresh and clever. Millie is sweet, funny and the kind of girl I'd like for my best chum. Her romantic troubles are the kind I can relate to and the plot was believeable. The heroine wasn't drop dead gorgeous or fabulously wealthy...in fact, she works doing ""Kissograms."" The men -- surprisingly for this genre -- were real people. Even the ""cad"" turned out to be a good guy.I highly recommend this for a way to kill a rainy weekend. Just make sure you start it earlier in the day than I did! LOL"
5,Millie's Fling,"This one of the first books by the author I have read. I absolutely loved it, I stayed up all night reading it, laughing and thinking, oh no, how could that happen! It was sweet and lovely and gave you a good feeling at the end."
4,Very Fun Read!,I really enjoyed Millie's Fling a lot. This is the first book by author Jill Mansell that I have read and I can tell you that I will be reading more. I truly enjoyed the eclectic cast of characters she brought to the table. I liked how she followed everyone and not just the main characters of Millie and Hugh. The only thing I did not like was the ending was a bit too abrupt for me. I would have liked just a bit more of a wrap up for some of the characters I came to love. All in all for a free Kindle book I thought it was a great romantic comedy. I will be looking for more British Chick-Lit soon!
4,fun read,"Got it caz it was free...and i liked the cover!!It was funny and i finished it in two days.I didn't get some of the Brit lit, but still was funny.In the mood for a worry free, laugh at someone elses mistakes..sit down and relax!"
4,Humorous and Charming,"I agree with most of the other reviewers. This was a delightful and funny British chick lit novel. The writing carried you along and was considerably above most of the standard chick lit genre. There were certainly too many echoes of Bridget Jones -- the dysfunctional divorced parents, the gorilla costume kiss-o-grams -- but they were forgivable because of the over all charm of the writing and engaging story. I would probably download all Mansell's novels (not just the freebies) if her publisher didn't adhere to the agency pricing model. Even a 10 to 20 per cent discount would entice me to buy all of her books. As it is, I will content myself with the two volumes (Miranda's Big Mistake is free as of this writing) the publisher is giving away. Too bad because I really liked this author."
2,Average,"I didn't particularly enjoy this book. The writing was decent, but nothing special. It was hard to keep up with the different viewpoints--one minute we're reading Millie's mind, the next we're reading Orla's. The story itself was nothing new or interesting, though I did give it a chuckle once or twice (the predicaments Hester finds herself in are a bit amusing). The ending was the biggest disappointment of all. It seemed like there should have been at least one more chapter to give the audience some closure. However, if you ever get trapped on a desert island with this book being the only thing in your posession, I suppose you could have done worse."
4,Fun (but disorganized) read,"I enjoyed this book to the point of laughing out loud more than once. It was a cute story with quirky characters, the kind that are so completely normal but exactly the kind of person who would just by chance befriend a famous author and it seem realistic. I fell in love with the characters and their British dialog. It's definitely chick-lit and for nothing more than an easy, light read. My only complaint is technical, and I was honestly surprised to learn, when I came back to review it, that this was a ""real"" book and not one of the self-published ones I happen across sometimes. Jill Mansell switches perspective so frequently that it's difficult to keep track, and I couldn't help but be distracted by thinking that I shouldn't know what all these characters are thinking. I learned early that perspective should be consistent, and I have a hard time deviating from that. All in all, though, I had a good time reading this book."
4,"Surpising find, great read","I recently purchased a Kindle, and like all new Kindle owners I am sure, I was looking at a few free books. This was offered as free for a promotional. I thought why not give it a try. I must admit to having little in expectations.Wow was I in for a surprise. This is one fun book. Its an easy read, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have some substance. I read it in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. I found the characters fun and fresh, the plot interesting. I loved everything about the book. I plan on finding more books by this author."
4,"Fun, sassy, enjoyable read","What fun it was to read this. Without going into much detail, this is light, quirky and entertaining. You really can't going wrong with a British character...her charm comes through in the writing. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will look for the author again."
5,Great read,"I loved this book! I ran the gammat of emotions while reading it. It is imaginative, laugh-out-loud funny, sad at times, romantic, sexy, filled with great characters. Millie's Fling is very well written; absorbing. I couldn't put it down! Highly recommended. Thanks to SourceBooks Landmark for my review copy."
3,Cute but lots of subplots,"This was a cute romance that moved pretty quickly. The main character, Millie, is very likeable. She intervenes when a famous author is about to jump off a cliff, and then said author decides that Millie will be her next project. It did seem like there were a few too many threads (and IMO - too much cheating among the secondary characters). Maybe a few less subplots would have made for a tighter story. At the same time, reading this one was an enjoyable way to spend an afternoon."
3,"Pretty standard, but funny contemporary romance","I read this book on my kindle because it was free, but I liked it well enough. It's a pretty standard romance, with some funny scenes. But for me, this book was worth reading for the odd Britishisms alone. Every character is a bit of cardboard cut-out, but who cares? It's fun to read.Read this book if you need to chill for awhile. It's kind of like watching a movie on the Hallmark channel."
4,Millie`s Fling,Mansell ingeniously delves into the inner thoughts of her characters capturing a lot of how most of us would react to situations. a delightfully witty read.
4,Light and fluffy,"Pretty standard chick lit. Very light, very fluffy, very formulaic. I picked it up before it was $9.99 on Kindle. It's really not worth that. Half that, maybe. I enjoyed it well enough. It was good ""turn off your brain"" reading."
4,Really good book,So far this book is really good. I didn't finish yet but for a free download it is a good story.
4,Great fun!,"I actually got this book since it was free on kindle and I have to say, what a wonderful surprise!! Amazing character development, funny stories and interesting plots. You can not help but cheer for Millie! I read it in 24 hours and will be looking for more Mansell books."
4,Funny and Entertaining,I finished reading this last night in bed and I ended up waking my husband up from laughing too much. This book will literally have you laughing out loud. Definitely an enjoyable read.
4,"Fun, laughed a bit, would read more of this author","Got as a free Kindle download (always skeptical), but was a really cute book with some witty dialogue and a unique plot for this genre. Enjoyed it, looking back would have been pleased even if I'd paid for it. Will definitely read more of this author."
3,More like 3-1/2 stars but fun,"I read this book directly after finishing Mansell's book ""Miranda's Big Mistake"". Unlike that one (which I thought was wonderful), this book was a bit of a let down. I was hoping it would have been at least as good (or close).This is an enjoyable read but the characters were not quite as likeable as those in ""Miranda"". I was not a particular fan of Hester, although I did really like Lucas, Millie's parents and Orla. And her crazy bosses were a hoot.If you haven't read any books by Jill Mansell, I would not start with this one, as I don't think it really shows how great her books can be. (I'd recommend ""Miranda"" instead.) However, it's still a fun read."
3,Millies Flig or is it Hesters,"The authors writing style is good and light. Except I kept waiting to read more about the main lead Millie. Instead the whole story was about Hester and when not about Hester than Orla...Millie looked like a supporting actor to Hester and Orla, heck even her mom had more fun than her. There was hardly anything about Millie Hugh (millie boyfriend), inspite of lack of content for both of them they fall in love and the portray is that they know each other long.I think along the way the author sidetracked and forgot about the title of the book and Hester and others became more interesting.The book was a good read if you forget about Millie , hence just 3 stars."
5,Loved this funny chick lit book!,"This book was fun from start to finish. Millie is a great character. Loved this one, is fast paced and better than my expectations."
5,1-2-3 Magic: Managing Difficult Behavior in Children 2-12,"This DVD is producing miraculous results in the families of those who are implementing the method of 1-2-3 Magic. The DVD is very clear, succinct, interesting, and invaluable for parents and children. Nowadays, parents seem to be afraid of their children, and children seem to reign over the lives of their parents. This method can transform the quality of family life as well as the nature and character of the children who follow it. The sooner parents can implement this gentle but firm and unwavering strategy, the better... before the children turn into teenagers."
5,Seriously good parenting advice,"I am the mother of a very strong-willed 3 year old. I originally bought the 1-2-3 Magic book, and faithfully read it cover to cover. My husband is not the reading type (if there's no pictures he doesn't want it) so when I saw there was a video I purchased it quickly. We watched it one night after the kids went to bed, and it was very much like the book except even more in depth. Both of us looked like idiots, nodding and saying ""UH HUH, YES!!"" throughout the whole thing because it seemed like Dr Phelan knows our child. We instituted the practices and I can tell you it works. It is so very simple, yet so profound. The babysitter has it now and my mom will get it next. It's also great for teachers. Two warnings: it's pretty darn expensive but it's worth it! And this only discusses the ""stop"" behaviors, you have to purchase the 2nd video for the ""start"" behaviors, which I haven't done yet."
4,Good thing to pass on to struggling parents,We reviewed this program before we sent it to our daughter and son in law. If this doesn't help them we don't know what will. We bought it because we wanted them to hear the message about consistency from someone else. The program is quite clear and well presented.
3,Excellent Guitar-Orchestral Problems,"I purchased Sharon Isbin's recording of the three concertos by Rodrigo, Villa-Lobos and Ponce. The guitar playing by Sharon Isbin is outstanding but there are serious balance problems with the orchestra specifically in the first movement of the Rodrigo. The balance between the guitar and orchestra itself is very good but the woodwinds and horns sound stringent and if played at full volume they overpower everything and will startle you.I have several recodings of the Rodrigo and I prefer the Decca recording of Carlos Bonell with Dutoit conducting the Montreal Symphony. Jose Serebrier and the NY Philharmonic must have corrected this for the Villa-Loboa and Ponce because they are very well done."
3,NEUTRAL FEELINGS,"These function adequately, which is the bottom line. However, the do not have a good taste, so I tend to forget to take them as scheduled. Not again."
2,dont get fooled by the price,"With items that you are going to feed to your children for promotion of good health...you have to be very cautious with the ingredients. Other Ingredients: Sucrose, Dextrose, Fructose. sucrose is fine...as its sugar/beet...fructose...just another corn based product with 0 nutritional value.you also have to take 3 per day, just to get your dosing....so the value is negated."
4,Very Good movie,"I had seen it before, reason I ordered it as I liked it. So all is good dvd works, so all is good"
5,Greatest movie of all time,This is the greatest movie of all time!!!!!!!!!!! I watch it every year and decided to finally buy it so I can watch whenever I want.
2,What are we ever going to do with you Lattimore...,"Again, this is typical Lattimore interpreting the text ""too"" faithfully.The word-for-word style works for scholars and it is they who praise him the most, but it doesn't work for me. I always am looking for poetic creativity, and not redundant interpretations. That's why I keep coming back to Stanley Lombardo's translation of Hesiod and also Mr. Frazer's translation.Not a first choice among regular people seeking the best possible translation of Hesiod."
2,A disappointment,Hesiod was a bit of a disappointment for me. The Works and Days was full of agriculture tips and his advice on how you should live your life. There was very little to do with the ancient Greek Gods and was just the advice of one man on how an individual should conduct themselves. Theogony was more of what I was looking for with a version of the origin of the ancient gods. Hesiod spells out the beginnings of the gods very well and it was the most enjoyable part of this book. I would recommend Homer or Virgil before trying this work.
4,I'm impressed,"As I was strolling down the music aisle of Border's at ten o'clock on a thursday night I stopped dead in my tracks. There on the shelf was a Tommy Stinson album. As a die hard Replacements and Westerberg fan I was amazed. Tommy had finally decided to venture off on his own. So of course I bought it; for 18.99 to be exact. I listened to it over and over and I was very impressed. The album is deffinetly influenced by Bob Dylan and Westerberg, but it is also full Stinson's own unique style. While the lyrics are a bit dry, his voice is great. I hope he has many more of these solo releases to come. In the meantime by VGH. You won't regret it. Oh yes and who else just released a new album? Why Paul of course! What a wonderful world."
3,Not too bad...,"There are about 4 or 5 decent songs on this record. The song OK is excellent. The rest are fair. The only real problem with this record is it sounds dated, like it was realeased in 1995 instead of 2005."
5,Tommy Stinson is a great recording artist!,"Tommy Stinson proves once again that he can easily stand alone and sound great. I just got this album last week and it sounds great. It's so much of his influences in his music. Great rhythms, melodies and lyrics. Tommy is a bad @ss no doublt about it. I will be listening to this album over and over many, many times. I love great music but it's so hard to find nowadays what with all the radio stuff, lack of a much better term, out there. And of course the ever-increasing lack of musical taste among the younger generation."
4,What!? No scratches?,"Having seen lots of gun camera footage over the years, it was a little odd seeing the same footage without the scratches. Lot of work went into cleaning these segments up.I like the idea of showing the footage at full speed and then slowing it down and re-showing it again. You miss a lot of detail at full speed.I don't like the idea of not having the segments indexed. From what I could tell, if I wanted to pop the DVD in to the machine and go to a specific piece of footage, I have to fast forward/back and hope that I'll find it in short order. Not the best situation for a quick look.Each segment is accompanied by musical scores. Most well picked for the piece, some left me wondering what the heck they were thinking when they selected it. Some of the music was better suited for a video game.The DVD is well done, but a bit pricey, even for Amazon. If you really are interested in gun camera footage, it's worth having........ Otherwise, too expensive in my opinion.AGSanchez"
2,Very uncomfortable,"The screwback on these earrings is not for everyone. They are very uncomfortable and difficult to put on. The earrings are well made and the stones were beautiful, but unfortunately, while they were nice to look at, they were unwearable."
2,"Very Good quality , but BADDDD movie","I saw this whole 'novela' on cable (560 capitulos), but missed the last 2 'capítulos'. So i decided to order this item. I was astonished 2 see that it was like this very first part of the 'novela' and then suddenly the end. They let important parts out of this. Maybe someone who didn't see this 'novela' will think this is a good one. But i saw it! And i would not recommend it to anyone!"
1,crapy,"they cut out all the good parts out of the soap opera, not realy good to buy. they cut so many parts out of the soapopera that its not worth buing"
3,not what i expected,The video was in very good conditions. I didnt have a problem with that but it is only 8 hours long in total which cuts out many important parts from the original novela. If you are a big fan of this novela you will be dissapointed because its a really really short version of the novela but if u just want to remember the story then go for it.
1,boring,boring as heck novela and cant realy get all of it since many parts of it are not in the disc. :(
2,Problems Out of the Box,"Based on information I read in the other ratings displayed, I ordered the Huang 1248 with the expectation of buying a quality instrument. My order arrived quickly and the instrument is very nice looking. However, I found it nearly impossible to play notes softly in the lower and upper octaves of the ""C"" section. A large amount of air is required to achieve any tone and the tone is loud and brassy. Using the ""C#"" section of the instrument, I was able to achieve in both lower and upper octaves tones that were totally controllable in volume. I never experienced this condition using my Hohner, so I don't believe it's my technique. I'm very hesitant to recommend this instrument."
2,Hard to Play,Like one other reviewer I found this instrument hard to play. IT is well made but very hard to get decent notes in the higher and lower ranges.Its not all due to lack of experience either because I dont have trouble with the other brand I bought.
2,Not the best picture quality,"Yes this camera takes great pictures in low light, capturing subjects and background alike. As well, it does beautifully outdoors. It seems to have rave reviews but I didn't find the quality of pictures to my standard. I like crisp, clean, and sharp photographs. I found these to be a bit fuzzy and dull. While it has nice features, I expected better and was highly disappointed in the pictures themselves. They aren't bad if you just want average pictures, but if you are expecting nice clear images, you may want to be sure to try one out first. They look ok when you playback on the camera too, but not as well on the computer or printed out."
1,Good Underwater Camera - Do not buy Fuji until replace xD memory card format !,"I will never by a Fuji or Olympus camera again as long as they continue to use a non-mainstream memory card format such as the stupid xD-Picture memory card format.The camera is good. Both the stills and video are great - even sound comes through nicely using the Fuji underwater case.However once I discovered that taking and viewing underwater videos is much more interesting than stills I quickly came up against the limits of the stupid xD-Picture memory card format Fuji uses. While you can get a 32GB SD cards for low cost for every other camera on the planet, the highest capacity Xd memory card you can find is a tiny 2GB; fine for stills but sucks for video ( especially when you have to open an underwater case to replace). The xD format is a dead end - do not expect to see increased capacity memory cards.-Ed"
4,fine pix review,"Still learning ins and outs. appears to be the kind of camera anyone who is even remotely serious about their photos would enjoy.first switch to another brand in 25 years, and i am quite pleased so far.ONly reservation in because of incomplete study so far.expect a 5 star rating barring something un foreseen.Purchase company also gets a five star."
4,Just buy it...you'll like it.,"I've had the f30 for 10 weeks and I really like it. I take it everywhere in my pocket (in a 3x6 inch plastic snack bag to protect the screen from scratches).This a remarkable piece of technology. The images are as sharp as many larger and more expensive digital camera but pictures at the ASA 3200 are pixelated. The power engineering is amazing...daily pictures for a week without recharging.The camera controls are are good as possible with a tiny camera. The minimal shutter delay is a welcome improvement over older digital cameras. The auto mode takes great pictures in many different lighting conditions. The macro mode usually gets the focus sharp. The double picture mode, one with flash and one without, is great for the many picture when you really want a good picture and are not sure whether to use fill flash. The museum mode, no sound no flash, is great for stealth photography.Everyone who I have allowed to try the f30 wants to buy one."
2,Fly Trap Doesn't Trap Much,Used this fly sticky tape trap in the garage where we had a knat fly problem. We also had some fruit fly type bugs flying around also. Our neghbor has a big fig tree that isn't pruned of taken care of and all the figs stay on the tree and rot till they dry. Smells really bad and attracts the flys that go into our garage because of its proximity to our garage. We put these up and only caught about 3 to four on each one. We had better results with the sticky traps that unravel. These caught much more knats.
3,Works okay...,"Like others have said, hanging this up is useless. You have to lie it down in an area where the flies like to land. I have caught dozens and dozens of flies with this, however I have noticed that some of these traps are stickier than others. The flies in my house also seem to have figured out how to basically ""walk"" down the trap until they get to the end, where they can get unstuck and fly off. Maybe 25% of the flies escape, and the others are trapped. I actually have taken to pressing the flies into the trap once they land, to try to keep them from escaping, but this is disturbing and I'd rather not have to do that. The Catchmaster Window glue trap is really superior to this product by comparison (but is currently unavailable...)."
1,Is this a Joke,"Okay so I have a little garden in my back yard that attracts a lot of flies and I have been looking for a way to combat them once they are in the house. I wasn't sure if they still made Fly Paper but when I saw this after searching in the great Amazon I was excited. From the moment I opened the box I was dismayed and I seriously cannot decide if this is a joke or not. The packaging says the box has stunning 3-d images to draw in the flies, these images are perhaps the funniest drawing's I have ever seen being called 3-d...this product has not caught a single fly they simply ignore it and fly everywhere but at the stunningly realistic 3-d images anyone got a better idea?DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS PLAYING A joke on someone"
1,Not so sticky situation,"I'm fairly certain that once caught, the flies are supposed stay stuck. Not so much with this trap. It's become part of our daily routine to compare how many flies there are on it in morning with how few are left in the afternoon. About 50% of them escape from it."
1,Doesn't Work In Colorado,I ordered two of these and placed one in the narrow laundry room just inside the back door where all the flies come into the house (I leave the back door open for my two dogs to go in and out of the house when I'm home.) and put another one in the kitchen where the flies hang out while I'm cooking. Apparently Colorado flies are far too smart to get close to these things. I have not caught ONE. The only way these 'traps' are going to eliminate flies in my house is if the flies die laughing.
3,"Not what it appears, but works.","The Victor Poison-Free M500 Indoor Fly Trap appears to be something that attracts and traps flies, but what it really is is a box with fly paper on it. It worked well in catching the fruit flies I had, but isn't exactly what I expected."
1,Caught exactly ONE fly!,"After two weeks, I decided to check on the fly trap. I expected to find at least 100 dead flies.But what I found was a single dead fly, I guess It died a lonely death.My backyard is infested with literally thousands of flies, but somehow all the flies magically flew around this fly trap.Spending $6.08 is too much just to kill a single fly. I could have saved money by killing one manually with a fly swatter."
1,Doesn't work at all,"After a week of hanging up right in the middle of the swarm of flies on my basement, it hasn't caught a single fly. The flies are constantly flying all around both of these that I hung, and I'd be flabbergasted if some weren't bumping into it even just by random accident, but not a single one has stuck to it. Don't buy these!"
1,I should read those reviews before ordered.,Let's put in this way. Flies stay on these traps and left. It looks like a safe island to flies.
1,Waste of money,"Please do not waste your money. This Fly trap is absolutely useless. I bought two of this product for the kitchen, we always BBQ and go in and out by the Pool and fly's get in the House. We have started to make jokes about his product not ONE Fly so far has gone on both of them since i hang it up 2 weeks ago :) Terrible Product!"
1,Didn't work for me.,"Placed around the house for several days, setup a fly attracting trap in vicinity. literally watched the flies avoid this trap. after 2 days I was excited to see one lil'bugger land on the surface, only to be disappointed when I approached to examine and he flew away! the paper is tacky when the pressure of a human finger is applied, but for most small flies it is hardly a trap."
5,THIS ITEM IS EXCELLENT TO KILL INSECTS,I am so happy with this Item. I had too many flies that were disturbing in my kitchen. I put the product near the window and it works fantastically
2,We have so many flies in the house. Have had this product for 3 weeks and it has only stuck 1 fly thus far.,We have so many flies in the house. Have had this product for 3 weeks and it has only stuck 1 fly thus far.
1,A big rip off,"I wish I'd read the reviews before making this purchase. It's basically a cardsotck box that is sticky all over the OUTSIDE. Those pink-ish things that look like entrances ""into"" the trap? They're just pictures. There *is no* inside of the trap. All the flies will be stuck to the OUTSIDE. It's basically fly paper, just horribly, horribly HORRIBLY overpriced.Do yourself a favor and just get fly paper or fly strips. Same yuck factor, but much cheaper."
1,This does not work...,"After a summer grill party where the door was kept open all day/ food was out on the countertops, we developed a horrible fly infestation in our home. My husband bought this trap and it did not work, not one fly was caught. I ended up putting a tiny smear of honey on one side and that actually worked, the next day I counted over 30 flies on the thing. But by itself, it does nothing to 'attract' flies."
5,They're gone!,After several assault parties with flyswatters we turned to some other technique. After a day of hanging two of these the fly population has all but disappeared....NOW we can get the remainder!
2,not worth buying,wasn't worth even the money spent. poorly made item and didn't really work on catching flies. was wasted effort in even buying.
3,It's OK. A fancy flypaper,"The picture was a bit misleading. I thought it was a trap where flies entered inside and were trapped, like a roach motel. When I received it, the design looked different, and it was obvious that it was a a square ""tube"" coated with very sticky adhesive, where the flies land and stick. As such, it works but not exactly what I expected. I would have designed it differently, though and put the adhesive on the inside and entrance holes on the outside so it doesn't look so ugly when the flies are caught."
3,Pretty basic,"Not a lot of content here- big type, lots of repetition. Says in about 100 ways that back pain may limit your sexual activity and don't feel guilty about it. Duh! There is some practical advice on positions and techniques, but mostly stuff you'd figure out yourself through trial and error. Some good content on what can cause back pain."
2,I am skeptical this does anything...,"I have a strong feeling that this is just a bit of colored gasoline, and that I got suckered. I think I will never know. Has anyone actually factually demonstrated that this really works as it claims? The best I can say is that it likely won't hurt, but the placebo effect doesn't work on a car engine because it has no mind so what's the point!"
3,Why doesn't amazon take pictures of back labels?,"I just received mine. Why write a review if I haven't tested it yet? The back label says this product can only be used for two years after opening. I think the product description needs to be updated. I expect to use 40 gallons of gasoline in about 5 years not 2. Simply put, I would still buy this product, but with this information I would buy a smaller bottle."
5,A must for winter,It has been around forever and works like a champ. Use it and you will be very happy come spring.
4,Messiah of Evil is AWESOME!,"...MESSIAH OF EVIL is an astounding visual scare fest. Absolutely one of the the most visually disturbing flicks I've ever watched. It's like CARNIVAL OF SOULS and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD meets NIGHT GALLERY on acid. The transfer on Diamond's disc is lousy and the print that it came from is awful . Someone needs to clean this movie up and give it a Special Edition. It you can get through the less than stellar source elements...I am a converted fan forever. It is slow, but just so CREEPY!!"
4,35th aniversary S.E. Messih of Evil,"Code Red has put out a very good dvd of Messiah of Evil. It's a creepy surreal film that kind of reminds me of the film The Birds except its the people of the small town that are behaving strange. It's a bit slow at the begining but the pace does pick up by the time it gets to the market scene. This film is rated R but to me its more like a PG-13 there is no real nudity or extrem gory shots. The music is the back bone to the creepyness of this film. I highly recommand it for the horror fans out there it's worth putting it in your collection. Extras include an audio commentary,featurette,two short films,and it's in anamorphic 2.35 widescreen. The only thing i would suggest to Code Red is to put English,Spanish and French subtitels for a wider market. Horror fans might also consider Lets Scare Jessica to Death"
3,DEAD PEOPLE,"Double feature DVD with THE DEVIL'S NIGHTMARE / MESSIAH OF EVIL, also known as DEAD PEOPLE (1973).DEAD PEOPLE is brilliant. A one-of-a-kind film.Unfortunately, I can't say the same thing with THE DEVIL'S NIGHTMARE (La plus longue nuit du diable (1971)). It's disorienting, awful, and cliched. Get ready to sleep."
4,A Must Read for all Women,"As a pro choice sometimes Catholic, I was ASTOUNDED at the lengths the Catholic Church would go to to ruin the lives of two nuns, simply because they had asked the Church to formally re-open discussion on abortion and birth control.The book tells the story of these two nuns, and how they came to leave the Church... Which, quite frankly, made me want to rip the crucifix right off of my neck.An excellent read, though the book focussed a lot more on the nuns' own personal religious indictrination and less on the pro choice movement. I would have liked to have heard more about the women they met during their tenure--women who changed their minds about birth control and abortion."
4,The King of Hop!,"Who'da thunk? Michael Jackson, beer reviewer. But that's what he does, reviews the finest beers this side of the Columbia River, which doesn't actually go very far. Which means nothing but good taste! Hey, why not? Sausage man rolled the dice."
4,Could I apply for the job?,"Another quality book from Mr. Jackson. Brilliant photographs, easy to read, enough to give one a thirst! Doesn't seek to impose his views by ratings (which I found a surprise). Unusual shape / format for the book, in a chunky style which I liked. I'm sure an enthusiast for beer like Jackson would like to have put many more than 500 beers into the book if it was at all possible."
4,Fun Stuff,"Great guide for those new to beer and those who have dabbled in its glory for years. This book is a wonderful collection of hundreds of various beers. Good learning guide and will make you either keep up, or blow away, people in a conversation while going out for drinks after work. Interesting and worth having around. Only downside, not many classic American beers included, but inspiring enough to make you want to try wordly tastes. Even has mini guide on how to taste beer, serve it, and what its made of. Comprehensive and user friendly."
2,Not useful,"Compared with other similar books that help readers understand and select products (e.g. wine, cheese, etc) this book about beers is not helpful at all. I could not use it for the main purpose I had bought it: to help me select beers when I go to a liquor store. Most of the beers featured in the book are absent from the US market (or too hard to find).I don't think it is a useful book, at least not for me."
4,Goes Deep into Humor and Pathos,"Seventeen stories document men's search for, discovery of, and commitment to lasting love. The best reveal personal experiences that provide insight into particular aspects of the human heart. Standouts include Rick Moody's ""Companion Species,"" about his emotional evolution from lonely cat-hater to happily married cat lover; David Sedaris's ""Old Faithful,"" a hilarious battle with a boil; and Colin Harrison's moving ""Incision,"" recounting his father's illness and death. The book is a poignant reminder that indeed, men are from Earth (not Mars), and love is both mysterious and necessary."
2,Uncommitted,"I'd have to say the stories are very uneven in their quality and approach. There's a variety of styles and some of the contributions are just downright boring. McManus, Seabrook, and a couple of others are the exception. Strangely, most of the seventeen authors all seem to be Jewish or Irish, but perhaps that just reflects the ""big city"" flavor that permeates almost all of the stories; that, and the fact that most take place in the 60s and 70s. I'm not so sure we can draw any significant conclusions in this decade from men whose experiences have Vietnam, Nixon, and the drug culture as a backdrop, and the authors themselves are not exactly household names. Spend you money elsewhere."
4,"Small, Compact and useful",Perfect while in the woods. Will work nicely when identifing tracks. Will work nicely when carrying in pack or back pocket.
1,"Great pictures, little technical detail, not for kids!","The book has beautiful photographs of models that have been expertly painted. However, there isn't a great deal of information on how to render these effects. I bought the book for my son to use in detailing model cars and model superheroes only to find that a large part of the book is devoted to painting nude fairies! These are anatomically correct women with butterfly wings on their back. Needless to say, we won't be using this book. I am writing this review primarily to warn other parents considering this book for their kids."
1,Wind sensor won't work,"I got this as a gift and after installation the wind sensor did not work. I opened the sensor unit and found the magnetic sensor broken in two. I called the customer support line (5) Five times and left a message. NO REPLY! I tried e-mailing the ""support"" in box - NO REPLY! ZERO customer service - NIL - ZIP - Anyone want a defective weather station. I would avoid La Crosse Technology products at all cost."
1,Piece of Junk,First remote failed 3 weeks after installation. Bought a complete second station expecting to use them in the family room and our bedroom. Worked great for another 11 months. Then the second remote died. Now we have 2 dead remotes. No response from customer service after 2 emails. Stay away from this company. Poor quality and no support.
2,"Nice temperature station, otherwise worthless garbage","Our rain gauge and wind meter almost never worked. After fiddling with them for years, I finally gave up. They would work for a few minutes then stop, or a few hours, or days. It makes no sense whatsoever. Next time I will buy a wireless indoor/outdoor temperature & humidity unit for a lot less money. As countless others have said, this is disposable high priced techno-garbage with miserable technical support who lie and blame me for their defective junk."
2,La Crosse WS-9035U,"I had great hopes for this product when I ordered it, but, after a little more than 1 month of use my unit is consistently +/- 6 to 10 degrees from actual temperature (figured by cross-checking with other temp sensors in the yard) that is just not accurate enough in my opinion. In addition to the temperature question, the indoor unit ""loses"" the signal from the outdoor unit at unpredictable and varying times even with fresh batteries and for no apparent reason. This causes the entire ""outside"" measurements to ""blank out"" for several hours at a time. The readings always seem to come back eventually, but all in all, for anyone who is more than just casually interested in weather observation, this system is too undependable to be relied upon."
3,Wind meter is not accurate,I bought this weather station specifically for the wind sensor. Unfortunately its not accurate. It is securely mounted and it is also in an ideal spot that is unobstructed by buildings or trees. To get a general ball park figure of what the actual wind speed is I have to double the reading that it gives me. I also don't get a wind chill reading unless the unit is measuring wind at about 25 mph. If you are looking for a weather station with an accurate wind sensor look somewhere else. Everything else about the unit works fine.
4,"Nice product, but with Amazon not carrying way too $$!",I bought mine for a $120 a year ago and gave as a gift. They really liked and looks like $. This price is just too high.
5,Best of many models considered,"We like this product. The interface is clear with just the right amount of information and none of the cutesy icons found in some other models. Installation was easy and setup simple. No range issues in the 50' between transmitter and receiver. Note that if mounting the receiver on the wall, it needs to be mounted somewhat lower than you think since viewing angle is sharpest from level to about 20 degrees above."
2,Wind Meter Never Worked,"I bought this weather station mainly for the wind meter. I watched the price go down to fifty dollars and knew this was a great deal. However, the wind speed always showed 0.0 on my display. I tried everything suggested at the Lacrosse website and by their customer service. The customer service people were limited in technical proficiency and were slow to respond to calls. Everything else works fine. However, my experienc seems to be the exception to the rule. I spent a lot of time trying to make the wind meter work. Mine is just a cautionary story."
2,Wind sensor maxes out at ~30 mph....,"I was waiting for a decent Santa Ana wind to review, which we had last week. We had 60-70 mph gusts, but this unit only measured 33 MPH at its maximum. Very disappointing. I also wish it recorded historical wind gusts, but it does not.I think the forecaster is a bit more accurate than most, this is a plus. I hope they come up with a fix for the wind speed."
4,Weather Station,"We purchased this weather station as a replacement for an existing weather station. We have had one of these weather stations for approx 2 years and love it. However, recently its operation had been sporatic so we purchased this replacement. It is one of the few weather stations we've found that includes wind speed at a reasonable cost."
1,LaCrosse Weather Station Quality,Received a WS 9035 as a gift. Mounted it two days ago. Easy to understand assembly. Everything seemed fine. Wind gauage appeared to be cheap construction. Last night the wind meter became intermittent.(we had gusts to 25 mph). Today stopped working entirely. Pretty disappointed
4,Great value for your money,"Obviously, this is not one of the extremely expensive, high-end weather stations, but it's very good for such an affordable one. I was thrilled to be able to get it for Christmas for my weather-happy boyfriend on my limited budget. And he was thrilled to get it. We had Christmas at his parents' house, but that didn't stop him from installing it on the roof to play with right then and there, then taking it down and installing it at home. He keeps the station on his desk during the day (working from home) and by his bed at night. It's a great hit.The only problem we've had with the wind sensor so far is that we don't have a level and weren't able to install it perfectly straight. We'll remedy that soon. For such an affordable weather station, I think this is really remarkably accurate. And I did the research before I bought it, so I expected no less."
1,Does not deliver on its promises,"I became interested in this CD based on the fact that people who purchased Sundari-A Jivamukti Yoga Class also purchased Asana 2, Moving Meditation. These two albums are radically different. I've found Sundari to be meditative and conducive to relaxing yoga sessions. I expected Asana to be more upbeat, but still meditative and inviting to do yoga by. Not true. This album is based on a continual synthesized drum beat, and despite the fact that it is billed as being by ""various artists,"" each track is repetitive and does not vary from the same tiresome beat of the previous track. Nothing about the album could be honestly recognized as meditative or spiritual, despite the suggestive titles of various tracks. I was quite disappointed with the album and found that it does not deliver on its promise of a meditative workout."
3,A shotgun approach where a smart bomb is called for.,"I anxiously awaited reading this book after coming across it. Unfortunately, the book jumps all over the place. Dunnigan spends a few pages on the history of a service, then a few more on the current reality, then about one page on the future. The author manages to refer to his past successes as a well known war gamer, and even details a project he did for the National Parks Service. I just wish this three year Army vet had gone into more detail on the future digital services........"
3,Weapons Evolution at Glance,"It's no masterwork, but Digital Soldiers provides a decent overview of the evolution of modern weaponry and the driving forces behind the production of weapons today. Sure, it's informal, but it's hardly dull or utterly embarrassing."
3,Interesting look into the lives of three single women,"I thought the structure of this book was challenging and entertaining -- I suppose for some it was like trying to connect the dots on a semi difficult puzzle, for the three women Roth researched were so similar that I often had difficulty remembering who was whom. However, I just let the fascinating and glamorous life these three successful thirty-something single women carry me. Roth was proficient at illustrating the everyday lives of Jen, Casey and Anne and their pitfalls with men, careers and cocktail parties. Reading the rock-hard wisdom and wicked wit in their dialogue was food for thought. Melissa Roth's research was excellent and I applaud this fabulous effort..."
1,Possibly the worst book I've ever forced myself to read.,"Being a BIG fan of Candace Bushnell and Sex and the City, I was excited to pick-up Melissa Roth's book. Until ""April"" (Chapter 2). The reason so many readers may find themselves flipping back to see who's who, is because the author never fully develops a single character!!! The women are vapid and shallow because Roth keeps them that way. But the real problem with the book was terminal BOREDOM! I AM in the Entertainment business, I HAVE dated jerks, and my life is laugh-out-loud funny, emotional, and rarely as matter-of-fact as these three women and the author would have you believe. The content was so slow moving and non-consequential, there was nothing to make me turn the page to the next month (chapter)."
3,I have to agree with dearmary@micron.net from Idaho...,...on the point about not being able to distinguish one woman from the other. I'm about 1/2 way through the book and still have to keep flipping back and forth to remember who's who. Either the author picked 3 women who were too much alike or she didn't do a good enough job in distinguishing between them in her writing. Or perhaps a little of both.It certainly is just like a long Cosmo article in that guilty pleasure sort of way and it's a great premise for a book. I just wish the three women didn't blend together so easily. It would have been much more intriguing rather than just being Cosmo-esque.
2,Borrow it from someone,"As a single woman in my 30's, I wanted to relate to these women but it didn't happen. Perhaps these women aren't really this self-absorbed and lacking self-control, but that's the way the author writes them. Why couldn't she have found a woman who works as an accountant or administrative assistant? Not everyone leads such glamourous lives; flying from coast to coast, meeting, dating and sleeping with high profile men. I almost gave up half way through because I was turned off by their bad choices, but I persevered because I wanted to know how it all turned out. So, in that sense, it was not a bad book. If this is what single life is like in CA and NY, I'm more than happy to stay in the midwest."
1,sassy girls give it a double thumbs down,"We found this book very difficult to read. Following all four characters throughout each month rather than finishing one before starting another, made it very hard to keep everythig straight. By the time we finished, none of us could match the character with her job, boyfriend, city, etc. We did enjoy some of the funny anicdotes and could even relate to a few. But, for the most part, we felt these women led very similarl unique lives which none of us could relate to. However, these were not the stories of unique women tackling extraordinary issues important to professional women in their 30's or even the stories of three ""real"" single women and their fun single lives. The women came off very shallow, caddy, and self absorbed. Roth would have done well to have at least choosen one or two women outside the entertainment industry."
1,"Unless you're really a good crocheter, don't buy this book.","It has some great patterns; unfortunately it also has a great deal of errors in the patterns! It is also a British book, and that means that the stitches are very different to American stitches, so unless you know the conversion, it's very difficult for an American to follow the patterns. Plus, the author tells you to do certain things, like particular embroidery stitches or pom-poms and then doesn't tell you how.Definitely not for the beginner, and a real disappointment to me."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"The edition of this book I have seen is from 2002, published in North America, and uses American terms. The photos are indeed adorable. the colors used are not the typical pastels and the designs are clean and modern. the color combinations are inspiring. I feel the smock pictured on the Amazon page (on the cover of the softback book) is the best design in the book. However, it is made in Patons Baby pure Wool 3-ply, which is apparently not available in the US. Finding a substitute for this yarn has proved quite difficult for me. The directions call for a 2mm (steel size 4) hook, which is quite small; I mention that because some crocheters do not like to use such small sizes. The garment size ranges are quite limited; the smock is in sizes 0-5 months and 5-10 months. Another nice design is the Icelandic cardigan (in reality a fairly simple variation on a round-yoke design)--this is for size 6 months only."
5,good book,good book a lot better than the new metro one. i heard they stopped printing these so hold on to them they are nice. use it all the time on the job
1,Not what I expected from a Remo,"This Tambourine has ""cheap"" written all over it. Although the double row jingles sounded ok I couldn't deal with how crappy the plastic skin was...no tone at all and just a very dull sound. I had to return it."
2,poorly made,"While this product arrived promptly, it is poorly made. I had to duck tape the ""scythe"" to the pole to prevent it from falling off."
3,"Looks okay, not too sturdy","We used this item fairly heavily in our play, and had to hot glue it after a few performances, but it served its purpose well enough."
5,Launching Pad for Craftstman-style Interior Design,"The best candidates for this book are those who have purchased or are planning to purchase a Craftsman-style home; however, that should not exclude those who just want to replicate the style in their decor. Although there are many style characteristics of the Arts & Crafts era that are easily identified, this book sheds light on a wide spectrum of pieces with literal authenticity.While not a complete collection (items such as light switch coverplates and heating register covers are not included) these reproductions of Stickley's catalogs are the perfect foundation for those looking to purchase Craftsman-style interior accents.If you desire to maintain as much as possible the look of the Arts & Crafts movement in your interior design, this book should definitely be a staple in your library."
4,Very useful,Very useful for parents and students!For me it is a good and quick helper English is my second language ).
4,"Finest kind of escapist reading, woo hoo!","I recently have blown through a quartet of novels by a writer with the unlikely name of Bartle Bull (he's said to be a former publisher of the Village Voice). The politically incorrect but somewhat historically accurate novels set mostly in Africa in the 1918-1943 timeline are quite a delight, assuming one goes for African Adventure and I do, boy howdy. These novels are fun, intriguing and semi informative. And, they're about AFRICA.For those largely ignorant (as was I) of the Italian invasion of Abysinia (aka Ethiopia) in the mid-Thirties, Cafe on the Nile is especially interesting.The White Rhino HotelA Cafe on the NileThe Devil's OasisShanghai Station. OK, so it's not Africa; it's Shanghai. Sue me, do.Finest kind of light reading, perfect for escapist holidays, beach reading, flight numbing and generally out-of-the-loop fare. To be enjoyed."
2,Ho Humm.,"If you go for gratuitous violence and sex, and can identify with characters who are not credible, this is the book for you. Despite these faults something kept me reading on, perhaps just curiosity as to what outrage might occur next. Also, a friend whom I respect had sent it to me and I felt a certain obligation to read it so I could comment on it when I saw him next. If you have time for purely escapist reading I guess it's OK. I'm a slow reader and don't have time for this sort of stuff."
2,An African Gross-Out,"If a story featuring gruesome descriptions of African parasites, a white hunter cavorting with young teen prostitutes, and kinky dwarf sex is your cup of tea, then go for it. I felt like the author was trying to rub the reader's nose in the filth and squalor of much of Africa, as well as the degeneracy of many of the post-WWI colonials. We get it already. Throw in a large cast of characters, and a narrative that jumps around, and you've got a tiresome read."
5,the cultivator works grate. but the cost shipping was high.,the cultivator works grate and is well made. but the cost of shipping was high!
2,A little disappointed.....,"I was looking for more things to do with my class during lent. Most of this book deals with Holy Week and Easter. Granted, I will use this portion of the book during Holy Week. However, I wanted something substantial for my class during the lenten period. Sorry--I know the reviews have been great. But if you are looking for lenten activities, this is not the book for you."
4,"With practice, tool works fine...","I needed to practice with this perforator to make a straight line(even with ruler), because it kept veering off. But I finally learned to control it's actions. I loved the small size, because I had to use it in different places and it fits in my pocket effortlessly."
5,Mini Rotary,This product was excellent for what I needed. I needed them to make perforated tickets and they came out very professional.
4,Does what it describes,"Does well with paper and some fabric. Make sure you use a cutting mat, especially on fabric because you have to press pretty hard. The size makes it a little difficult to handle but you get used to it."
3,Not good for card stock,"I bought this with the intention to perforate card stock and you just have to push down too hard to get it to work. And it's really hard to make it go in a straight line. On regular paper it worked decently, still a little difficult to make it straight."
3,no straight lines,"Very difficult to make straight lines with this product. Even when I use a ruler as a guide. When I press hard enough to punch through the paper, the cutter has a mind of it's own. Great perforations, just wish it was easier to control."
2,Rough writing,"I wanted to like this book - I love sheikh stories. But this is the second Kate Walker I've tried, and I've found her writing to be jerky. The main problem is speech tags - more are needed to know who's speaking. I can figure it out from the context, but it's too much work! The characters were also not my cup of tea -the heroine was too reactive for me. I like that this writer seems to explore new directions, and I did enjoy the writer's command of sensual language, but this book feels both over-written and under-edited, if that makes sense...?"
1,Tacky!,Snow White was one of my favorite fairy-tales and I like Christmas cartoons so I watched this Snow White Christmas cartoon and it is without a doubt one of the worst Christmas cartoons I have ever watched! It's painfully bad and way beyond cheesy!
1,Dreadful!,"I like to watch Christmas shows and I taped a lot of them off of TV and loved them so I was watching and taping Snow White Christmas and being a fan of the animated Disney Snow White movie I thought this Christmas show would be good but it wasn't, it was dreadful the absolute pits,the voices are annoying and the dialogue is very corny, so I turned the tape of and didn't tape the rest and I don't regret doing that at all!"
3,Cute Christmas Movie,I taped this movie when I was young and look forward to watching it every Christmas. It's a very cute and sweet movie. I'm surprised that it has gotten bad reviews on Amazon. There is something about this movie that I absolutely love and I always look forward to watching it around Christmas time. It's just a cute Christmas special.
5,Young Kids love it.,"Although many adults may find this movie boring, corny and tacky, young children find this movie fun and interesting to watch. I show it to a number of groups of young children in the schools I substitute in. It should not be literally compared with the earlier Disney version, since that was made forty plus years before this one. It can be contrasted and viewed as a continuation of Snow White's life story.I think this movie can be used to teach young children about growing up, getting married, and having a family. Snow White as a mother and King (Prince) Charming as a father may be hard for older Snow White fans to accept, but young children will see it as a natural phase in life. The seven friendly giants (the dwarf's cousins) can be used to teach values such as honesty, and compassion.I think this film has educational value and should be shown on TV more often during the holiday season."
3,Okay for the kiddies,"An adult would find the uncreative plot, Giants with corny names (including one named Corny!), and bubbly songs particularly annoying.... but children (for whom this is intended, remember?) will love it."
4,A Must Have,"Having a Chilton is a must have whenever you are working on a car (I don't care for Haynes). The only better guide to have is the factory service manual itself.Overall Chilton does a good job, but occasionally the directions aren't entirely clear or it can be difficult to find a part in the index."
3,Not the answer to my questions,"This book presents sex as the result of a lot of exercise and the magic touch to two places in the vagina. I could not even finish reading it. If you only want one or two books about female orgasm in your library, this is not the one to buy. If you would like to read as much as possible about female orgasm, I recommend it. I did learn a few new things.."
5,Super fast hairdryer!,"I borrowed my sister-in-law's hairdryer while visiting her and fell in love with this hairdryer. I immediately came home and bought one on Amazon.com. I have very thick hair and it normally takes a long time to dry. This blowdryer is very fast drying and has all the settings you could ever need. The cord is super-long. This comes in very handy when trying to dry my two year old's hair as she moves all over the bathroom! It's a little heavy, but that's the price you pay for the power in it. I don't find it uncomfortable in any way. I highly recommend this hairdryer and am hoping that it lasts. I have only had it 2 months so far. Last time I got my haircut, I realized that my hairdresser was using the same hairdryer on me and the place I go to actually sells them (but it was slightly more than what I paid on Amazon)."
2,Expensive Dud,"This blow dryer is quieter than others, but heavy and bulky to use.The worst is that it sparked & quit on me only a few mos. after I got it; should be under warranty, but what a hassle. Too expensive for that!"
1,Software provided,"The supplied installation disk does not support Windows XP as stated in the manuel. When opening up the program up the supported systems say Windows 98, 98SE, 2000, and 200 ME. No mention of XP or XP pro which I use."
2,I would just get a new printer and not buy this card.,"The card works all right. My printer is 10 years old and works great, but my new computer didn't have the parrallel card to plug it in. I had some problems getting a driver for the card, but finally got one to work, even though Windows said it was not a signed driver - it did work. If I had to do it again, I'd just keep the printer for my older computer and buy a new printer."
1,Simply terrible!,"This has just got to be the worst book I have ever read, or at least the worst Oz book I have ever read. It both starts off bad and ends bad. Mr. Wogglebug (again in this book he is a professor) tells the Scarecrow that he has no family tree. But he would NEVER say a thing like that. It's IMPOSSIBLE for him to EVER hurt ANYONE'S feelings. Then the Scarecrow goes searching for his family tree, he finds his bean pole and comes to the Silver Islands where the inhabitant's look like China people. And he discovers that he is their emperor, Chang Wang Woe, and he has a rather large family, but he later returns to Oz. This book is SO stupid. So please don't read it. Mr. Wogglebug is really supposed to be kind, caring and sweet."
5,"A lively, funny Oz book","On a quest for his family tree, the Scarecrow travels to the Munchkin farm where Dorothy originally met him. He falls down a magic beanstalk (the pole Dorothy rescued him from) and finds himself in a strange land, the Silver Islands, where he is proclaimed to be the re-created Emperor Chang Wang Woe. Meanwhile, when Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion realize that the Scarecrow is missing from the Emerald City, they go off in search of him. In this story, you'll meet many delightful new characters, such as the Doubtful Dromedary, the Comfortable Camel, and (my favorite) Sir Hokus of Pokes. Like Ruth Plumly Thompson's other Oz books, this one is as lively and at least as funny as L. Frank Baum's series. Thompson wrote 19 Oz books, so if you like this one, there are lots more to enjoy."
3,Too Many Issues for Eternity,"I usually really enjoy Rosalyn McMillan's books, and is the case with this one, but there were really too many issues in this book! There was counterfeiting, day care; including brokers, child tragedies, dreams, mental illness, civil right, Parkinson's, spouse abuse, politics, etc. The best part was the connotation of guidance, and what that means spiritually.The explanation of why a woman was trying to destroy an entire family was still not explained understandably.Get it from the library!"
3,Definitely readable,"I have found that with McMillan's books, you either love them or hate them. I have read all of her work and found them to be enjoyable, for the most part. The only problem that I have is that some of the situations that the characters find themselves in seem a little too unbelievable. For instance, Isabelle's hatred towards Anne and the others seemed a little far-fetched. However, this was a pleasant read and will do very well for the author, I think."
3,OK,"If you're looking for an easy read, pass this one by. Though this book had some page-turning moments...those few moments were drowned out by her overuse of her ""moments in history."" This book was a toss-up between a novel and history book. Towards the end, I found myself skipping over the majority of the pages to get to the actual story which was somewhat like a soap opera. Not one of the books that will make my all-time favorites list but I would recommend to someone to read."
2,I thought there was going to be a history test on Memphis!,"If Rosalyn could have kept to her story line in this book without all of the dates and historical information on Memphis I maybe could have given this book 4 stars. But just when she gets into the story line, she takes a sharp left and starts throwing dates, political names, famous names, monuments, hospitals and stuff that has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the story line! I don't care what hospital Elvis was born in and how did it relate to the story! I read a review here on Amazon.com where a reader said that she literally through it across the room... I FEEL YOUR PAIN!"
3,too many charactors and plots,"I feel this book had great potential, but Ms Mcmillan had too many plots twist and under developed charactors.1. Isaboel Ford was book unto her self, her reasoning for hating Anne and her family were totally unbelievable. I thought Isobel would have more direct connection to Anne to justify her obession.2. Basil turned out to be a half way loving son and devoted brother but early on in book, great detail was given to fact he was a Jr. Monstert i the making.3. Wesley's charactor totaly faded out.4. Nikki's charactor totaly unbelievable.I have read all of Ms Mcmillans book and one thing sticks out is all her novels have many plots, charactors but she is unable to string them together so you never really know any and leaves you feeling disconnected."
1,Good try but falls short,"This has the potential to be a wonderful book. McMillan's attempt to incorporate events from the Civil Rights movement could have helped make this a gripping family epic.Unfortunately, the historical events are like unrelated news flashes interrupting the storyline. This black soap opera is long and unimpressive. The characters lacked substance and believability. This was less the story of a Southern Black family caught in the Civil Rights era and more of a movie-of-the-week melodrama."
2,Not impressed!,"First, I had to read nearly a third of this book before it peaked my interest. Then, I found it to be too far-fetched and the family had a MUCH too tragic existence. From death to disease, it was more than I bargained for. The history lesson was decent and it demonstrated that a great deal of research time was spent. This was my first book by this author and despite the fact that I did not enjoy it, I will read others. Better luck next time Ms. McMillian!"
5,Loved it,"I liked this book because the history in it. Although confusing at first, I quickly understood the nessessity of it. Excellent characters and situations. I'm not a avid reader of novels, but this is one book I couldn't put down."
2,Did Not Enjoy This Book,"It was good if you wanted a history lesson on Memphis. It wasn't a good fictional novel to read. I read all of RM's books. I'm am truley disappointed in this one. There first three novels were great books but the last two weren't great novels by a long shot. I would not buy this book. If anyone is interested in reading this book, check it out from the library."
4,Promising Historical Fiction,"THIS SIDE OF ETERNITY is a fictionalized account of the civil rights era and beyond, and centers on the lives of two African-American women--an aunt and her niece. The novel covers the period from the 1960's to the present, and the setting is located basically in Memphis, Tennessee.Although Rosalyn McMillan generally tells a good story (I liked her other four novels as well), her inadequate knowledge and sometimes awkward use of grammar and sentence structure can be annoying. Ironically, this weakness has not improved over time because her earlier novels were not quite as flawed. If readers can overlook this minor distraction, however, they will enjoy THIS SIDE OF ETERNITY for its fine characterization, interesting plot, and unique perspective on a turbulent period in America's history."
3,Nothing To Brag About,"I think Rosalyn should take a tip from her sister Terry and not try to write a book every 3 or 4 months. I found several errors in this book the spelling of names, double negetives, not to mention the fact that the story jumped from person to person and back again. The story of Walter Russell children, nephew, and nieces,trying to make it on their own after his death was a good plot who needed the murders, abuse and rapes both physically and emotionaly. Not a book I would read a second time. Maybe because of where I come from, growing up doing the civil rights era it was hard to get into."
2,Much Drama,This Side of Eternity starts slow. I had a hard time getting into the book. My friends said keep reading it gets better. One family with so many tragedies. Where was the family love? The story was nothing like the book cover
2,Maybe with some work I could learn to compensate.,"Anyone expecting this machine to take the guesswork out of making perfect rice every time will be disappointed. My partner and I, both experienced cooks, have had no success with it. We've used several different rices, but always end up with sticky rice which is dry and browned on the bottom. Maybe it works better for larger quantities--we've only used 2 or 4 cups. Maybe it would work better if we added more water. I just checked the Krups website for support and cannot find the product--maybe it has been discontinued. Our cooking goods store will allow us to trade it in on a different brand, which we intend to do. Until then, I'm sticking with risotto, even if I have to stir it myself for 20 minutes."
3,Not the worst or the best rice cooker,This is the second rice cooker I have owned. Both have been in the mid-price range. For what I use it for it works just fine. I tend to make rice and throw a bunch of other stuff in while the rice is cooking. It does not tend to boil over like the other rice cooker I have used. Sometimes it may overcook a little on the bottom but not as bad as the other rice cooker I have used.The non-stick surface cleans easily. I have had the cooker about a year and the non-stick surface is still in good condition.It's not the best rice cooker ever but it is far from the worst.While this one might not be the rice cooker for you I strongly recommend buying a rice cooker. It is a quick convenient way to make healthy meals.
2,Basic American Rice Cooker,"So far this is my 2nd american brand rice cooker and it has also (...). I received it as a present. Unless you cook at least 4 cups of rice the rice will burn. Also, when it cooks the water and bubbles are filled and the steam comes out - almost thought I was doing something wrong. When the light changes to ""warm"" it needs to indicate in the booklet you have to wait before serving to let the water evaporate or else you will have very soggy rice. My mom and friends have Asian brand rice cookers and although expensive they work much better."
1,Krups Rice Steamer,"This product made good rice. However, in doing so it made such a mess; I had water and starch all over the countertop and applicance. It made no difference whether I rinsed the rice or not or how fill/empty it was. I took it back to the store."
1,This rice cooker sucks,"I bought one of these hoping that it would acutally take less time in the kitchen. This thing takes more time than cooking it on the stovetop. Plus, it burns everything. I haven't had this product make a good thing of rice yet. I've tried everything from adding more water/liquid to making more/less rice. It doesn't work."
3,Mediocre Arrow Holder,"The outer case material and closure mechanism seem fine.The internal foam is flimsy. There are straight cuts in the foam for the arrows. By the time you get the 2nd arrow in a slot, the foam is forced open at the top so the 3rd arrow slips. This would be better if the foam was a bit more rigid with cutouts to maintain the spacing between the arrow shafts."
5,X in top form,"I recently saw X live in Atlanta, Georgia and was blown away with thier amazing performance, this DVD displays how they still have a passion for playing punk rock music. Good picture and sound, if you like X, buy this testament of punk history!!!"
2,Blast from the Past,"I'm a collector of SuperHero memorabilia and thought I would give some information regarding the CD. The tracks were originally released by Golden Records in the mid to late 60's and are a word for word reading from Spider-Man #1. A reprint of the book came with the record. The ""Turn the Page"" alert has been removed, but all other references to the comic are still on the CD.Golden Records didn't put much in the way of production value into their children's records. The acting is stiff. The sound effects are a bit hard on the ears. The CD's one saving grace is that it's fairly easy to find reprints of the comic. If your a fan of old superhero book & records, then you'll enjoy the CD. Otherwise, give it a pass."
1,Bad,"This CD seems pretty bad to me, but I suppose if you're a Spidey fanatic AND don't mind things cheesy, you might like it...if advance clips and reports are anything to go by, it looks to be the greatest superhero movie ever..."
3,The original 60's episode,"It's not a rip off movie if Stan Lee is the executive producer, much less if he's staring in it albeit in small role, then its just a retelling, and a dang good one at that considering he's one of the main creator's. That and Sam Raimi is a director who is actually a BIG fan of the comics not just some director who wants to cash in on a franchise/trademarked superhero.But what I really wanted to mention is that the original 60' ""Origin of Spiderman"" episode is on DVD with the ""Ultimate Villian Showdown"" that is a rerelease of the FOX kids series that came out a few years back. It's well worth getting, especially since it has that old ."
2,"Great format, but not for anyone looking for perfect technique...","I purchased this disk as a supplement for practicing/reviewing colored belt Hyung at home. I found the format and presentation of different angles unique and useful. My only negative comment...and it's with no desrespect intended...is with regard to Sah Bom Nim Young Kil Song's application/technique as demonstrated in this DVD. The forms presented, while correct in terms of the movements, are not executed with the technical accuracy that I expected. I'd hoped to see crisp blocking and punching executed with proper form, but was disappointed. Basically, no DVD or book can ever replace personal instruction from a qualified master/grand master. Tang Soo!"
5,A life saver!,"Getting Them Sober is still one of the very best books to help people deal with a drinking alcoholic. If you follow the suggestions in the book you will finally feel sane again, life will be easier, and the alcoholic MAY get sober! I am long time sober and worked in the Alcohol Drug field for many years.This works, it really does! Dee Brown"
4,A good book for anyone living with an alcoholic,This book is a bit dated but still very informative. I would recommend this book to anyone who lives with an alcoholic. The title of the book is kind of a joke to get you to pick it up - what it's about is how to take care of you.
4,Very helpful,"This book was very helpful to me and my family, but there were a TON of spelling errors and words that did not belong in sentences, I could usually work around them and get the meaning of the sentence but it was annoying."
2,For battered spouses only,"Although the author claims that the book is equally applicable to male or female spouses of alcoholics, is is written almost exclusively from the perspective of a dominated spouse with low self-esteem. Little useful guidance for other circumstances. I agree with other comments that the numerous spelling, etc. errors were very distracting. The least helpful book on the subject of alcoholism I've read so far (out of five or six books)."
1,This book is mistitled.... It should be called Al-Anon for Dummies,"I had hoped that Getting Them Sober would have offered some advice on creating an environment that promoted sobriety for a recovering alcoholic - it didn't. It did offer help to those who are in co-dependent, possibly abusive, relationships with an alcoholic. In other words, it offered the same information that attending several Al-Anon meetings would have offered."
3,Cute and Warm,"This movie was cute and warm. Nice to see Randy Travis in a movie role, but he was a little stiff, and Rue McClannan was great. Kids were good do - A warm feeling in the heart type of movie."
5,A Holiday to Remember,"Funny, heartfelt with some good underlying messages. Rue McClanahan all but steals the entire movie. A good family movie at Christmas or any time."
4,A Holiday to Remember,This film was very interesting but a little hard to follow but it was still very good I am not sure if I would recommend this film
3,Not a Dolph Lundgren Movie,"This movie has absolutely nothing to do with Dolph Lundgren. However, I did enjoy this story about a runaway little boy who is a squatter in an abandoned house. To his surprise, a woman and her daughter move in. The woman has returned to the town where she had left her fiance at the altar. The daughter tells her mother that she hears sounds coming from the basement. They investigate and find the little boy hiding with his dog. The gilted fiance also happens to be the sheriff of the town. Not to give away too much, the boy's dog dies and he finds a home with a new dog; the mother and gilted lover work things out."
4,A Holiday to Remember,"This is a cute love story set during the Christmas season.I really enjoyed this movie. I like the characters that are portrayed by Randy Travis, Connie Sellecca, and Rue McClanahan. The character of William is adorable. It is a good family movie."
5,Holiday to Remember,It was a really good movie. It will be one that I'll watch over and over during the Christmas season
3,A Chick Flick for sure........,"A good story line, one that leaves nothing to the imagination. You know whats going to happen and thats OK.... you want to sit back and enjoy the magic. The only trouble was that there wasn't much. All the pieces to the puzzle were in place, but they didn't quite fit together. I guess if you had a thing for Randy Travis, it would have been much better. In my opinion he's a much better Country Singer than actor.....real stiff. But its not a horrible movie, just not one you want to see over and over again. Not Unhappy that I added it to my Christmas collection."
2,bad writing!,"This movie, starring the beautiful Connie Seleca and interesting choice, Randy Travis (What a missed opportunity as he does not sing!!!!) was sort of a flop. I agree with the other negative review that the female lead is way too harsh with the male lead considering she left him at the altar. There's very little chemistry (what a shame!) between the lead characters, and it takes a little too long for them to explain why she left for the film to ""work"". However, if you like to collect every Christmas romance under the sun, go ahead and buy it. Better choices are While You Were Sleeping, Christmas in the Clouds, or if you are watching with the kids, Snow Globe."
5,What is a Jew?,As a Christian I had many questions about the Jewish religion. This book was a God send. It answered all the questions that I had and reafirmed my love for the Jewish people. I am so happy that I ordered this book and would recommend it to all.
1,Never order anything from ANTOnline!!!,"I would love to be able to offer a review of the product, but I never recieved it! ANTOnline sent the wrong item to me and I had to go through numerous steps to send it back and I had to pay the shipping to send back the item when it was their mistake by sending me the wrong item to begin with and furthermore, I never recieved the item I ordered. I will never order anything from ANTOnline ever again and recommend to anyone who reads this to never order from them either!!!"
4,Awesome Wok for the Buck! :o),"Only recently did I start cooking Asian food, after a co-worker had brought in some food that she had made. She told me how to make the food, and after trying it myself, I realized how EASY it is. Anyway... about the Wok... I bought it about a month ago at a local kitchen supply store, and have been really happy with it. It heats up instantly, doesnt stick, etc.The reason I left out 1 star is because of a bad design. It's very hard to hold on to the handles when taking the food out of the Wok. They should have implemented one big handle, like on a pan. Secondly, their temperature control is sort of hidden under the wok, makes it a BIT hard to change the temperature... but it's not a big problem.Conclusion: If you want a great electric wok, for the price, this is defenitely a great one. I have no others that I've used before, but compared to any of my other pans/pots, anything... this is hands down the best for the buck :)"
5,Good Cooking,"Wok cooks fine. It replaced a many year old West Bend wok that the coating was wearing out, but still working fine.A great way to cook tasty, healthy food. It gets used at least once a week."
5,Great,"I'm really enjoying this wok! In the past I've had non-electric woks but decided to try an electric one (based on other reviews). I like the even heating and being able to set the exact temperature. Cleaning was easy, too."
4,a great wok,i like this wok very much.it is elaborate and works well. i always use it when i cook hot pot. the only trouble thing is that washing isn't convenient.i will give 5 stars if the wok can be removed from the base .
4,Mystique is JUST the first.,"I think the new author did an excellent job in writing her first book. I am really excited about the wait for the next in this series. Illusion should be as good or better. I had a hard time putting it down and wanted to finish it in one sitting. It actually took two sittings and I was sad when I finished it. If the author continues on this tract and does many more books, she will have a winner and hopefully a best seller or two. Keep up the good work."
1,This is not official or band approved version.,"I purchased the official version from German Amazon which is a superior version. That item includes a digitally remastered sound track cd along with the dvd . Remember if your a supporter of the band , they don't not get any money from the sales of the Cherry Red version . So buy the band sanctiioned one from the above -mentioned information . One does ask the question ,why the official one is not for sale in no other Amazon websites except in Germany?"
3,Band Release?,"All previous reviewers suggest buying the official band released DVD instead of this version - an idea I would be all for. HOWEVER, I've searched the Neubauten.org site twice and have found nothing that says there will be a DVD release that is different from this one. It would be helpful if the previous reviewers could provide some evidence / information concerning an alternative band release of the DVD.* Despite the above posters interpretation, this was not an angry review. Simply at the time of this review the band's site did not have any information about the DVD release and a extensive Google search proved fruitless as well. I felt that having this information available would be greatly beneficial to myself and others interested in this DVD. I fail to see how this implies that I am angry, impatient, or unsympathetic to a band's need to make money in order to continue their art."
1,Stay away!,"To the angry reviewer below who requested evidence that an official version of this DVD will be released by the band, that information is posted on their website under ""news"". The story about Some Bizarre not paying Neubauten for any of their releases is well established, and the band has made enhanced, remastered editions of those Cds available through their website. This DVD will first be made available on their 25th anniversary tour, then will be open to wider distribution. So my suggestion is, be patient, don't buy this unauthorized version, do the band and the music world a favor and buy the official version when it is released. If they don't get paid for their work, how do you expect them to continue to exist? BTW, my one star rating has nothing to do with the quality of this product... it simply refelcts the fact that it is essentially a bootleg."
2,DISAPPOINTED....,"got very excited when i saw this available,and now am paying for this impulsive purchase -this disc looks as if it was mastered from a 2nd or 3rd generation VHS copy!!!i hope that the version released by the band will at least look a little better than this!"
1,Stevo kills music,I really don't understand why it's still possible that this guy can publish artists material without their consent and them being paid for it. The official release will be avaible through www.neubauten.org
1,Stevo again... The Band is releasing something better,Check out www.neubauten.org for an official release of this by the the band. It's not available as I write this but it will be soon. it's an awesome video and I've been waiting for ages for it to come out on DVD. The band's release will be of higher quality.. and more importantly the band will actually get paid for it.Cheers..
1,Absurd,It is absurd that this abominable immatation is being circulated. It does a considerable injustice to the consumer and to the artists who labored to see it into existence. Amazon.com should remove it immediately and offer instead the authorized and region free version which contains valuable bonus material on audio CD.
3,"Accurate details, but typically 'Made for TV'.","Sums up the development of the SS very well, and the SS uniforms and insignia are absolutely spot on -changing as the years progress. So uniform enthusiasts should be pleased! The way the story is told is typical 'made for TV drama': it follows the career of a basically-decent young man who is persuaded to join the SD, the intelligence section of the SS, and finds himself getting drawn deeper and deeper into to a nightmare from which there is no escape, and having to do more and more things which are clearly wicked. Be aware that the 'girlfriend' (Lucy Gutteridge) is a night club singer with an absolutely DREADFUL singing voice -turn the sound down whenever she starts a song!!!!"
3,The SS,This film shows the problems of one family durring the Nazi rise to power and the subsequent war.. One brother is in the Army and the other brother joins the SS.At the end it shows the consequences of this action
2,Poor Quality dvd,"The movie was very good. A good story about two brothers coming up in 1930s Germany, and through 1945. However, the quality of the dvd was not good. To me it looked something that was copied off a VHS, (by an amateur) onto a dvd. The movie quality was not professionally restored. I have a top of the line Plasma TV, and I could not improve the picture with my remote by changing picture modes, size, contrast, etc. If this was a quality dvd restoration, it would be excellent.------Don Sawyer, Rochester, NY"
1,ANGRY!,ok i wish i would have read the reviews before this because i cant stand that it really is mostly cut its not even worth watching DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM HERE
4,Indescribeable,"A very strong story about family values being overlooked by war. Helmut and Karl Hoffman are coming mature right at the point of Adolf Hitlers rule begins. One joining the SS, and the other joins the SA. After grueling confrontments, both the third reich, and the familial connection will crumble and fall."
1,a real stinkeroo,I bought this video in the mistaken belief that it was a documentary. It isn't. What it is is a very badly made movie. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Don't buy it.
3,An interesting perspective on a familiar topic,"This movie views the rise of the Nazi regime from the perspective of two brothers, who are very ordinary people. At first each brother views the Nazis as just another political party. One brother becomes a full-time SS officer working for Heydrich, the other (who actually became a Nazi before his brother did) sees the evil of the Nazis sooner, and suffers for his outspokeness. The strength of the movie is its portrayal of ordinary Germans during this time period, and how they become caught up in the ugliness of the Nazi regime.The acting is so-so, but not bad if your expectations are not high. Jose Ferrer plays only a modest role in this movie--he is not the star. Overall an entertaining movie that is worth a try. The quality of the DVD video is slightly below average."
4,Interesting look at the SS' rold in Nazi Germany.,"It's an interesting persprctive, looking at the SS from the points of view of two brothers: one in the SS, and one who ran afoul of the SS. The actors playing Heydrich and Himmler did their roles excellently, and the depiction of SS reaction to certain events (Night of the Long Knives, Krystalnacht, and the July 20 Bomb plot) was also well done. The only thing obviusly inaccurate was the assasaination of Heydrich (he was assasinated in Prague, not in the countryside outside the city)."
2,only recieved a partial DVD,when i ordered this DVD the disk was defective. the movie started in the middle. i havent contacted anyone yet but be careful when ordering this dvd
5,The Story of Christmas,This is a wonderful book to teach young children the true meaning of Christmas. It ties in the tradition of gift-giving very nicely. An excellent stocking stuffer for all the little ones on your list!
3,"Good story, unattractive illustrations","I thought the story of Christmas as told by this book was simple enough for my young children to understand without diluting the meaning of the holiday or hitting us over the head with religious sentiment. However, the illustrations in the book are so unappealing that I dread it when my kids bring it to me to read to them. The characters were devoid of any personality and so very, shall we say, white bread. I give it a 5 for the telling of the story and a 1 for the illustrations, evening it out to 3 stars."
5,Fantastic Puzzle!,"Excellent puzzle - very fun to put together. Some of the pieces were so well cut to be challenging and fun that they made us smile and laugh putting it together. It's a little tough, fun and an excellent quality. Highly recommend."
4,Great for French Students!,"Jean-Franois Ménard does an exceptional job with the translation. All the major character conflicts that captivated me in English are equally conveyed within the French edition. I was pleased to note that all of Hagrid's foibles; every moment of quippy banter curtsey of the Weasely twins; and every heartfelt anxiety experienced by the young Gryffindor students translates fluently across languages. I would certainly recommend the Harry Potter series as an introduction into reading French for the French intermediate student. Overall, a very enjoyable read!"
2,"Pretty good, but unexpected.","I was looking for this book and all I could find was the junior edition. I finally thought I had found an adult/complete version, but I was wrong. The picture is wrong, the ISBN number is wrong and even the date published is wrong to the book that I actually received. It is still the junior edition! On the bright side it is in very good condition, but I would have wished that it was advertised correctly."
2,Why can't I buy using my Amazon account?,"Okay, I understand that Amazon was probably required to not sell the kindle version of the Harry Potter books directly on their website, but the shop.pottermore.com that they directed me to is just awful! It's like they took every good, customer-friendly feature that Amazon has, and did the opposite. I started out eager to read this book on my Kindle, but didn't make it all the way through the process. I'm disappointed - not in the book, but in the buying process for it."
3,Review for People Reviewing their French,"I got this recording so that I could read along in the book to help myself review my French. I figured it would help with my pronunciation and maybe understanding. However, he reads so very fast, that I can barely keep up! Also, I don't really care for the voices he uses for the different characters. (I've heard this read in German and I loved that version, so it's not that I'm prejudiced against hearing it in another language.)Another problem is that it is recorded in mp3 format, so I can't fast forward or rewind on my disc player.I'm not sure I'd recommend this to someone hoping to review their French. If you have any suggestions on that topic, please let me know!"
3,French vs. English text,"In my opinion the French text cannot match the vigor of the wonderful English prose. Very interesting, however, to see the differences."
4,ABRIDGED!!!,"Great book especially to learn French with. Keep in mind that it is abridged, wasn't aware of that when I bought it."
3,It's too small,You've seen how English version of Harry Potter book is thick and uses large text. This is not that version. This is small and thin and uses smaller font on single space instead of double space on English Version of same Harry Potter books. It's small but not useful.
2,Ah Huh...,...The English version of the book is great... it's a treasure. The French version is pritty dreadful and yet boring. The translater did a poor job keeping the spirit & theme of Harry Potter alive. Will hope the other books are better portaid in the French version as they are in the English one.
1,Disappointing Harry Potter,I ordered this book for a French speaking child of 11. I needed a gift for her and thought that she might enjoy reading the Harry Potter books. When I received the book I was shocked. It was a very slim paperback and not the book I expected. I thought it was very expensive for what it was - $13.57. I would not have ordered it had I realized what I was getting.
3,Hints at depths unplumbed,"An interesting, reasonably credible, well filmed sequence of events in a movie occasionally hinting at greater depths which are, unfortunately, left unplumbed."
3,good fit just what I needed but rusts,"These bolts worked great for what I needed them for. Unfortunately they are not very rust resistant. I used them on my truck and they started rusting within 2 weeks. I took 6 of the extra ones I had and put multiple coats of paint on them. I then used them to replace the ones that were rusting. I think that solution will do the trick. Good, hard to find bolts but be prepared to put some good paint on them if used for an outside application."
4,"3 Stars for Dark Side, 5 for Parallel Lives","I'm glad I bought this DVD set. I've shown it to lots of friends and family members (my Da, in particular, enjoyed Mo's miming of a woman's typical morning, while my Mum thought Mo and Kathy's imitation of older students taking a women's studies course was hysterically accurate). My favorite line from Parallel Lives comes from the characters of the little-old-lady Women's Studies students, visiting a museum for a luncheon. One remarks on the appetizing appearance of something she presumes is a display for lunch, and the other, realizing it is an exhibit, says ""No, no, my dear. (pats her hand) That's a [...] on a plate.""This is a MUST have set for mothers, daughters, Women's Studies enthusiasts, liberals, gays, ex-Catholics, current Catholics, feminists, activists, people who think outside the box, and those that love all of the above."
5,Kathy & Mo - worth waiting for,"I've been waiting for years for the landmark HBO special featuring Kathy Najimi and No Gaffney to come out on DVD. I don't know what took so long, but it was well worth the wait. The sketches range from hilariously funny to movingly poignant, often in the same sketch. This should put to rest the belief that feminists have no sense of humor. ""The Dark Side"" disc, however, was an unnecessary addition. With its amateur video and sound, it simply detracts from the overall quality. A masterpiece like ""Parallel Lives"" needs no additional material."
1,bummer quality,"I was very excited to find the Kathy & Mo Show DVD and equally disappointed at its quality. The beginning was terrible - both audio and visual. The quality improved through the video, but first impressions are important. This product was not represented as poor quality."
2,flomol,"I thought it would just be the Kathy& Moe show as shown on HBO.It had a lot of really ametur stuff done in small places with bad sound.Was really only about 20 mins of what I was looking for.I take some responsiblity,maybe I didn`t read the discription well enough.Not the sellers fault."
4,Sounds silly but I love it!,"I don't usually buy single-use kitchen gizmos but in this case, I had seen one in action at a friend's house and decided that I would break my policy for this item. The eggs are cooked perfectly and my only complaint is the 10 minutes or so you need to wait between successive cookings. (The manual says to wait 30 minutes, but that isn't necessasary.) Not bad if you are boiling up lots of eggs, but a problem when cooking poached eggs for more than one person (it only cooks two at a time)."
1,Undercooked eggs,"Looks like a great cooker. I think it uses the amount of water and the temperature of the heating plate to know when it is ""done"" cooking. So if there is still water making steam, the plate can't get much above 212 F, right? Well, even when there is water left in mine, the loud annoying buzzer goes off, and poached eggs are barely showing any white. And like some reviews state, it doesn't cool down right away, so you can't do anything but wait and try again. Also, it is not autmatic off, so it will sit there with the buzzer on. I am going to take mine back."
5,This is the best gadget in my kitchen!!!,"I did a lot of research before buying this egg cooker. I couldn't stand overcooked egg yolks than smelled like sulfur and were green. My soft boiled eggs were never the same each time I made them. Now everything comes out perfect every time.I especially like the tray that I can hold under the cold water when the eggs are done so no burned fingers. The alarm bell when it's done is great and it keeps going until I turn it off. Best gadget I ever bought and at under $20 with no shipping or tax, it's a bargain. Highly recommend!!!"
3,not quite what I expected,"For years I had a perfect egg cooker and then it quit working This egg cooker has been a challenge to use...rather confusing directions, measurements, etc. I don't like the fact that the egg poacher makes very flat eggs (was used to nice high yolks surrounded by a smaller, higher white). I am still trying to perfect boiling eggs, both soft and hard, and find the measurements and directions for doing it ""tricky"" to get right. For one thing the measurements on the ""tube"" are not easy to figure out or to see clearly."
1,Rust!,"After a few months the area that gets hot started to flake. This progressed to rust. I threw the unit out and am currently looking for a similar unit that does not rust. Before the rust, I would have given this 5 stars as it really does a fantastic job of cooking eggs."
2,Egg Cooker,I bought one and it lasted for one year and then the buzzer gave out. I figured it lasted one year of being used every day so I got another one. Out of the box the buzzer didn't work so I'm going to get another brand next time. Without the buzzer it isn't easy to use (too easy to lose track of time or forget to set a timer).
