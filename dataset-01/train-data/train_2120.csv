3,A dated release,"One of Oakey's first releases, and it's good mix of different songs. A good selection of fast paced songs with a few emotional slow songs thrown to cool it off before it heats back up.I would have given the album a 5, but if you compare to Another World, Travelling or even Tranceport, this CD just doesn't stand up as well. Another World is still his best release yet because it's the only album he's given where the entire disc keeps you in one mood/tone/world. Excellent track selection there. This CD sounds old now... the songs are old.I'd only recommend true Oakenfold fans to buy this. It's not worth the $30+ price otherwise.And this is not a sequal to his Goa mixes....-Fuzzy"
1,don't bother unless you love goa trance,"this is basically a goa trance mix with some filmic interludes. there are much better options from oakenfold out there, like the global underground set."
5,One of Oakie's Best by far!,This is my 6th addition to my ever growing Oakenfold collection and fuels my ambitions to keep it growing. Fluoro is rated at the top of my collection along with all other Oakie albums i've acquired. The Trance and Break Beats mixed with the Ambience gives this album a balanced fulfillment of what Oakenfold is capable of. I have yet to be disappointed. Five Stars!!!!
3,Not for all Trance lovers. Only for die-hard Oakenfold fans.,"This is very early Trance/Techno that is mixed well but not as well as some of Oakenfold's better works like Tranceport (his best CD to date) or Great Wall (His 2nd best).This is more industrial club DJ music that is fast trance, with lots of very early beeps and beats. I would only recommend this one if you are a die-hard Oakenfold fan or if you want to listen to some fast trance with lots of fast drums. It does not really peak as much as his better CDs and certainly is devoid of the magic, but there is a DJ in the making here. This may have been good for its time but there is a lot better Oakenfold out there (and some worse ones!) when all is said and done.This is very fast and early and not the best Oakenfold you can start with. I certainly recommend Tranceport over this one or Great Wall and prefer those CDs to this one but as you can see die-hard lovers of Oakenfold will rate this CD highly. I would not recommend starting here though."
5,Classic Oakenfold,"This is one of the most amazing DJ sets I've ever heard, apart from the classic Goa Mix, of which Perfecto Fluoro is essentially a part two. For those of you who complain about this being goa trance, this is some of the most emotive music that was being pushed at the time. Compared to the pap that is currently pushed as ""trance"" this music is a masterpiece. Pick it up and hear what Oakenfold sounded like when he was still pushing new sounds and going beyong the boundaries of being a ""hits"" DJ. For those of you with the will to search around, you can still find CD copies of the Goa Mix Part One. If you're an oakenfold fan currently, look up some of his older tunes and learn that theres more to trance than what you heard on Tranceport and GU New York."
5,A strong volume focusing on a western journalist and writer,"Writer Caroline Lockhart is examined in detail here, with a full and probing analysis of her books,short stories and articles. I found the use of personal correspondence, diaries and manuscripts helped to bring this writer alive. For those who aren't familiar with Lockhart, tbe late writer was a woman ahead of her time, writing such popular novels as The Fighting Shepherdess as well as working as a journalist with her own newspaper column. Her novels were quite popular but her real-life is equally fascinating and Furman gives an objective, well-written portrait of a writer who broke conventions and forged her own path."
1,THESE SUCK you get what you pay for,every use so far of these pans i have experienced a sealent comming out from between the bottom of the pan and what appears to be a heat transfer pad... this sealent burns with a disgusting chemical odor.. other than that these pans seem to be farely good.. if glue wasnt there they would get a 5 star rating for cost and functionality but since it is.. 1 star
1,NOT TOO GOOD,JUST BOUGHT THESE PANS AND AS FOR A NON STICK PAN ITS OK ACCEPT FOR THE SEALER THAT LEAKED OUT OF THE 2 PANS THAT I HAVE USED 1 TIME.. THE SEALER SEEMS TO BOND A SPIRAL HEAT TRANSFER PLATE ON TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN... I FULLY EXPECT THE 3RD PAN TO DO THIS ALSO.. MAY WITH SOME USE IT WILL GET BETTER BUT FOR NOW.. I WILL HAVE TO SAY LOOK ELSEWHERE OR YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR..
2,Rhino Misses the Boat,"How could Rhino do it? The most electrifying bass intro of the 60s is left off the beginning of Tighten Up, one of THE funkiest songs of all time. No opening bass line! Not only that, but the linear notes disses Archie and the Drells' early albums, loading up on their mid-seventies disco crud. True, the album has the three big ones - Tighten Up, I Can't Stop Dancin' and Gonna Be a Showdown. But Tighten Up is the only song from their first album included on this CD. No I Don't Wanna be a Playboy, A Soldier's Prayer, Give Me Time, or any of the others. Whoever put this compilation together for Rhino is NOT an Archie Bell and the Drells fan. The minute I put the CD on and heard Tighten Up start with the drum roll and not the bass line, I knew I would be disappointed. Let's hope someday Rhino comes to its senses and releases whole albums of Archie Bell and the Drells, not this pathetic compilation."
4,(most of) his greatest hits,"This is a great album. As some have mentioned, it's missing a few of his earlier songs, but for most listeners, everything you want is here. Tighen up, of course. Showdown. Can't Stop Dancin'. Tight performances by both Archie Bell and his band."
5,smoking grooves,this cd by Archie Bell&the Drells is slamming.the grooves you can dance to all day&night.tighten up is a funk classic.the way a funky set is supposed to start.a must have.
5,A great interpretation of a rarity,"I've enjoyed this disc than everything I have heard in the last year or so. Michael Tilson Thomas is a great conductor indeed - the best of his generetion along with Sir Simon. His orchestra - the LSO - is at top form, the soloists are magnificent and it's beyond any doubt that you can not find a match for this piece. Most of the times there are some passages as a fill-ups in some Debussy discs ( Baremboim's account on DG is one of them) but there is so much more to that music. A joyful experience. A must for any classical music lover."
4,works just fine,"the plate [A] costs almost half of the rack.looks a little odd for just a plate that all it's job is to hold the rack in place.once you use it,one can understand that there is a lot behind this product.it fit's just fine each car i tried [2] and it does the job.so; a little too pricey, yet a good product"
4,Dragon......,"For this to be a bargain-bin movie, it is actually the best one I've seen yet. Directed by Leigh Scott and starring Eliza Swenson, Amelia Jackson-Gray, Jon-Paul Gates and Jeff Denton; this 2006 film is about Princess Vanir who must traverse the haunted forest of Sidhe in a desperate attempt to save her kingdom from an advancing army of dark elves. With the help of Cador and Artemir, they encounter a mysterious sorceress, an army of elves and a dragon hellbent in standing in their way. Considering this is part of a trilogy, I'm looking forward to the sequels in everyway. This movie might not be liked by most who saw it but, for those of us who accept it for what it is, it isn't that bad a flick. You can tell the movie was made on a modest budget but I've seen worse movies made for more."
2,nice but not what i expected,"This product was shipped very fast and was in wonderful condition when i received it. However, I am disappointed because it does not really pick up much and even though it has a trash blocker on it, it only really found trash."
4,works well,"great product but seriously.....i was really excited about it, it came fast, i have tons or property for use and its where old treasures have actually been found....just not that into it afer a couple uses."
4,gold digger metal detector,nice unit . great price . very addictive . if you like being out and about trying to find something great .
5,review on metal detector,This was a gift for my 8 year old son who is just starting out. He loves it! It is a great detector for the money. It arrived very quickly which is always a plus when dealing with a child..asking when is it going to be here. He can't wait to go to the beach and use it there.
3,Tangle Edge - 'In Search Of A New Dawn' (Demi Monde) 3 1/2 stars,"Not great but a GOOD often hard-to-find progressive CD title.Better than their 'Entangled Scorpio Entrance' 2-CD release.Tangle Edge is actually a duo,Hasse Horrigmoe and Ronald Nygrd,that comes to you from Narvik,in Northern Norway.This disc features nine(9)cuts and the tunes I was most impressed with were ""A Secret Inside Clopedia"",""The Centipede's Tune"" and the fifteen-minute epic ""Solorgy"".Complete instrumental,no vocals.Might possibly appeal to some fans of Camel,Electric Sun and early Yes.Check it out."
2,Unknowing Order,I unknowingly ordered this product because I thought it was part of the Lockup series that runs on MSNBC. The product description and other information was extremely vague.I've submitted some photos and information so others don't make the same mistake.
3,"A good review of planning, law and sustainability.","The author has a great command of the planning profession as well as case law and its influence on growth patterns in the United States. As someone involved in land use and planning, but not a professional planner I found the book well written and easy to understand. I appreciate the authors argument and concern, however, I was left very disappointed with his concluding chapter as being too radical to every be taken seriously enough to be implemented. Maybe that's the point! We may not open our eyes to his thesis in time to sustain a sustainable future."
1,Unreliable delivery from seller,"Two weeks after the estimated arrival of my order, I'm still waiting. This makes me question the reliability of the seller (not the reliability of Amazon- as I've never had a problem with receiving orders directly from Amazon). I would suggest that if you absolutely need to order from this seller, you follow up with phone or e-mail contact. When you order medical supplies, it's usually not a situation where you can easily wait for a delayed shipment. I will not order from this seller again."
5,Wonderful,"this walker is light weight and easy to assemble and use. No heavy lifting required. It is also adjustable, so that no matter how short or how tall a person is, they can use it with no bending over. It is also great, for those of us that need a little extra help getting off the commode. I would also recommend it."
3,it's ok,"I got this for my elderly mother. It's light, it's strong enough. FYI - With two hands on the walker, it's hard to bring anything along. We got accessories (a bag and a water holder) for my mom to help her carry stuff with her. Sometimes it has a slight ""pull"" to the left (as noted by a physical therapist), so sometimes my mom veers to the left and has to re-adjust. Without comparing to any other walker, I'm going to guess it could have been made better."
5,Rubber wheels will not scratch floors--excellent product,"I just received this walker after prompt delivery and free shipping. I would recommend it most highly, especially for people who have hardwoord floors. The walker I received from the hospital (after hip replacement surgery) has plastic wheels and has scratched the polyurethane finish on our hardwood floors. This walker has rubber wheels which will not scratch floors. I have assembled and given it a first trial run. While a little heavier than the other walker, it is sturdy, quiet, and safe. And, as other reviews pointed out, the wheels can be swapped to make them run on the inside. Excellent!"
4,satisdactory,"This item was properly packaged and arrive here in very good condition. It is and functions as expected and I now use it daily.One problem: I was looking for spare rubber caps and slide parts and all I got was a recording from the manufacturer saying they call me back immidiately, They did ""2weeks"" later when I was not home. Their Customer Service, not very good..."
3,walker from Amazon,"I was disappointed with it: the wheels outside the legs made it difficult to go around furniture. I had someone remove the legs and reverse them so the wheels are on the inside where they should have been in the first place. Also, I am short, as are many seniors, and at it's lowest adjustment it is still a little too high for me."
5,WALKER,This walker is so much better for my dad who is 6' tall than the average walker. His other walker forces him to bend over while walking instead of being straight. It is sturdy and easy to adjust also.
3,folding walker,"I had a hard time searching for a picture of this folded, including the folded dimensions, and even amazon and the supplier gave me the wrong information. It came in a really big box that you could fit about 8 of this walker folded in the box. Unfortunately I can't find a luggage large enough to carry it abroad, so I just returned it. It seems durable and well-made though."
4,This product worked well for me,This walker was perfect for what I needed after total knee replacement. It is light enough that I can maneuver around with it and sturdy too.I have been using it for two weeks and will need to use it for at least two more. Very serviceable.
4,Narrow Walker,"We bought this walker to fit between narrow 24"" doorways. It is lightweight and easy to use. A bit expensive, but worth it. Yes, it comes in a big box, but the product is just what we needed."
5,"Moved over J.D. Rawlins, Here comes Robin Vaupel!!","Read early anonymous proofs....and this is an astoundingly entertaining read! Though it is geared for younger ages, it certainly is for ALL AGES! Good from beginning to end, and can't wait for the sequel. Man, this would make a terrific movie too! Urge everyone to tell their neighbors about this little jewel!"
2,Not a durable mouse,"I bought this mouse towards the end of the summer and have had it now for about 3 and a half monthe. The scroll wheel no longer works and it has a tendency to double click on its own. The self winding chord is more trouble than its worth, and I found myself struggling to keep the chord from jamming when winding up the chord. Also, the buttons push a little too easily, and I often press them accidentally. My last problem with this mouse is that the chord is very short and can't reach around my monitor."
4,The ONLY book I use... mostly.,"I received this book as part of a 5-day class I took on ASP.NET, and it's practically the only book I use. It's rare that an answer isn't somewhere in the pages of this book. It has great reference sections in the back for HTML and Web controls, and the chapters are full of information that you'll actually use. The book is written assuming you have some background in programming, but aren't an expert.The only complaint I have is that he's actually published code with ""response.write""s in it."
5,A really good book to learn ASP.NET,"To anyone wishing to learn the in's and out's of ASP.NET, I highly recommend this book.It is geared for the beginner to advanced programmer.As a mainframe programmer making the switch to web based applications, I found Walther's writing style and explanations extremely clear.He is clearly a TEACHER, who can bring his point across, clearly and concisely.Walther steps one through the various concepts with small examples that are meaningful and complete.After having completed a few of his examples one finds themselves adding an 'extra sub routine or two' to make the aspx page do something a bit extra. Personally this separates parroting from insight.In all fairness, one must be prepared to work through the examples that are presented, in order to obtain the most from the text. This is NOT an armchair read.Stephen Walther is to be commended for his excellent effort in compiling and preparing this book.Great value for money. You won't go wrong by purchasing the book."
2,Not as Good at the First -- Examples Already on Web,I was disappointed by this book. All of the material covered in this book is available at Microsoft's .NET web site at 100% less cost. It covers only the most basic of examples and if you want real world solutions and think you still need a book after looking at Microsoft's site it would be best to choose a different book. This book seems like just a way for SAMS to make money just like a bad movie sequel. Save your money!
1,The worse computer book I have ever bought,"Almost all the code does not work, including the most important part of ASP.net, ADO.net. Besides, this book doesn't cover C# code for ASP.net and there is no customer support at the author's Web site. Futhermore, some SuperExpert controls discussed in the book cannot be found at the author's Web site."
2,OK but not worth its weight!,"I agree totally with reviewer ""MCSD for Microsoft .Net (Atlanta)""The advantage of ASP.Net is that you can separate Display and logic. Every .aspx page can have a .vb file where you can have commonly shared functions, procedures etc and have most of the display stuff on the .aspx page.So you could have a simple label control in the .aspx page. In the code behind page (.vb) you can call another class, do a database query and populate the label with the data.What this author does is have all code in one single .aspx page for the most part. You miss out on knowing the main cool feature of asp.net of separating design and logic!! Stay away from this book.Buy Beginning ASP.net in VB.Net by Matthew Macdonald or""Developing Web Applications with Microsoft VisualBasic.Net and Visual C#.Net"" and is from Microsoft Press with a red cover. Both are good books, with an OO Approach."
5,ASP.NET Unleashed,This is the book I go to first for answers. I have tons of ASP.Net books but this one is a must have!
3,Not Updated for Final Release,"I purchased this book with the assurance that it had been updated for the final ASP.NET release. This is NOT ture. The infomation and examples are still based on pre-release code. After reader a section, I try out the example and find it will not run.I contacted the publisher and they indicated this has been a problem with the author who has refused to do the work. They offered me my money back which I did not take as I still find value in the book as long as I check the up to date syntax."
5,Great book to get your up to speed quickly,"I'm an experienced web developer who knows a lot of Java. I recently got a project in ASP.NET and turned to ASP.NET Unleashed to get me up to speed. It did that job perfectly.I was able to quickly find specific examples and explanations for features that I needed for my program. The book only prints code snippets in Visual Basic, but the included CD has all the C# code samples if that is your preferred language.I wouldn't recommend this book to an experienced ASP.NET developer because it's too detailed for a reference, but for anyone new to the environment (but not new to programming) it give just the right amount of explanation."
3,For Beginners its good,"This book covers the ASP.NET forms and form components in quite a detail but misses some of the most important and advanced topics. You can get anything related to controls and web related programming but misses to give detailed idea regarding what asp.net is all abouta nd dusent clear the basics.The biggest drawback i found was that every code in book was given from point of view of VB.net and the book stays far away from .net IDE. So after reading this book if u try to work in .net IDE, it wud b very difficult and might leave u disappointed.These are my views about htis book, someone else might have different views about it.Those of u who were impressed by ASP Unleashed, this book is a lack luster."
3,Good reference book. Not a good book for learning.,"I have 3 ASP.net books. Sams teach yourself ASP.net in 21 days is a much better book for learning. It starts out at a higher level and then goes to detail. The Unleashed book doesn't give you the big picture. The SAMS book also has comparisons with Java, which I like."
3,No CD-ROM or download site as advertised.,I received the book and it did not contain a CD-ROM(as advertised)and I could not find the download site as advertised on the back of the book.I have emailed customer support and as of yet have not received any response.
1,ASP.NET Anleashed????,"If you know absolute zilch about .NET technology, this book will make you know not much more. If you love typing, HTML/JAVA and you are an ""expert"" in WEB ""programming"" BS, you will love this book, but will learn zilch about .NET technology.If you heard that .NET technology is very good for people who would like to develop WEB applications that look like Windows applications and FAST, this book is not for you at all.Absolute waste of money AND TIME!!! Self promoting BS as usual!There is no way around - you have to RTFM - Read The F..n Manuals.And where is the f..n CD we paid for? Downloadable CD? Duh!!!Good luck with .NETting!"
2,somebody forgot about visual studio.net!,I just bought this book online thinking that it would come with the code behind files etc.. in c# and vb.net. To my suprise there is nothing but .aspx files that you can't do anything with. Hello.. this is the 2nd edition and apparently the author is not aware that 99.99% of people using .net use visual studio.net and not notepad!!! The material is still good but the implementation is very poor for a 2nd edition.
3,Seller to make sure before shipping,The seller told me that he included the CD along with the book but I did not recieve the CD. When Reported I was told to ship back the book in order to obtain refund but it was hassle for me to ship back so I got the CD from my friend.I am still reading the book so it is early to rate the text.
2,FOR WEB HACKS--NOT FOR DEVELOPERS,"This book was not written for serious developers. It's targetted to people who write web pages and might need to put a little scripting in them.I must admit that some of my disappointment in this book stems from my overall dissatisfaction with ASP.NET. However, the book does nothing to help me overcome that dissatisfaction.Disappointing."
3,"a lot of how, not much why","If you want to know how to do something (i. e., what code to type in) this book is pretty good. But if what you want to do isn't covered (or is poorly covered, which happens with some of the subjects), you're out of luck because this book doesn't explain why things are the way they are.Although I've only thumbed through it, I'd take a hard look at O'Reilly's Programming ASP.NET before buying this."
3,NOT a WEBMATRIX tutorial,"As with most SAMS books, this is a good reference and appears thorough on the subjects introduced.While the CD included contains all the software needed for using WEBMATRIX (MS's free ASP.NET developement tool), it is NOT what the book uses as its development platform. The author relies on the reader using a plain text editor to enter the examples.The book IS a decent reference and covers a lot of material in a manner that is simple enough for most non-web programmers to get thier feet wet. For that reason, I would recommend it for most beginners.Again, good introduction to ASP.NET but NOT tutorial for WebMatrix."
1,A thorough dissapointment,"When I first started looking for an ASP.NET book about 12 months ago, I saw that most sites recommended this one. But after I had purchased it I realized that this one had 2 major problems:1. The author uses text editors like notepad instead of VS.NET2. Everything's written in VB6.0 and not in VB.NETIf the above two don't seem like problems to you, go ahead and buy it.Also, I couldn't understand why many reviews have raved about the book. Even without the above two points I think its an average book. There are much better ones in the market that can give both knowledge and also help in the real world applications."
2,DONT BOTHER READING CHAPTER 7,"The book is just fine...until Chapter 7 on ""Targeting Mobile Devices with Mobile Controls."" Several of the examples, straight from the book, do not work. If they do work, they often work only in IE 6.0 with MMIT installed and NOT on Nokia's Mobile Internet Toolkit or Openwave's Emulator (both of these emulators are RECOMMENDED by the author!) If they dont work in the emulators then how can you expect the pages to work on a REAL CELL PHONE!My Suggestion Mr. Walther ---TEST YOUR CODE BEFORE YOU PUBLISH IT!I'm about to throw away this book after reading chapter 7, its garbage!"
5,Greatest Book,"I bought many books related ASP.NET. This book is the best book.If you follow the example sources, you will understand the underling concepts clearly.Great Book."
4,Great book!,"I really enjoyed this book. It is on the bulky side, but it's a good read. It is definitely exhaustive, too. I recommend it."
2,A hasty production,"Because the author jumps around and leaves much of the more elementary aspects untouched, the lack of promised CD and the way the web support was flung together after publication, makes me suspect that this was a rushed production trying to exploit the market. This is not a book for for beginners, nor for teaching."
5,Awesome Book,If you're starting out with asp.net (like myself) you need to get this book. Very straightforward explanations by Walther with good examples. Code is available online as well. You can't go wrong with this one.
2,"For such a thick book, I was disappointed","I bought the book hoping it would be a good reference as I try to learn my way around ASP.NET. Too often it didn't cover the question I had. I have found nothing that presents a good way to create rows against a DataSet or DataView. In the whole Create/Restore/Update/Delete (CRUD) system that we work in, this book leaves out the 'C'. If I'm mistaken, let me know!This is an example of a few of the things I expected a book of nearly 1400 pages to cover, but was disappointed with."
1,Didn't work for me,I attempted to use this USB device on a Windows 7 and a Windows 8 machine with no luck. Tried all of the USB ports and multiple diskettes. I grabbed a different USB device at work using same diskettes and had no problems. So something was wrong with the unit that was shipped to me. It's being returned as we speak.
3,Frustrated!,Te product arrived at a timely manner but I had to keep plugging and unplugging the device to get it to work. It ruined two floppys I had pics on.
5,Perfect,"Just what I needed for an old Sony Mavica camera. Works well, easy to store, easy hook up. Thank you!"
4,Good Product for the Price,It works OK and is a super cheap price for old technology.It came in strong packaging and arrived quickly.
3,It does what it does,"Sadly it doesn't work with the very first Mac floppies. I am going to have to shop ebay for an early Mac to read some of my disks. Backup, Backup, Backup and migrate you date. What a energy eating hole in the universe."
2,Can't read my disks.,"I bought this after reading all the reviews, and decided to give it a shot. When I got it, I was so excited, I put it to use and hoped to recover some files that I had put on some 3.5 floppies, however, the disks weren't able to be read. I even tried reinserting them and opening up the disk format, and all it kept saying was that the disks were needed to be formatted, which I would lose all my files. Waste of my time and money."
3,3.5 inch floppy external USB drive,"The drive arrived as expected, and in good condition. My computer, running Windows 7, did not initially recognize the drive. The box indicated that it included software to install. There was no software and there was nothing on the box or paperwork that indicated a manufacturer, model number for the drive, or anything else to identify what driver I needed. I downloaded a generic driver and it seems to work. For the price I cannot complain."
4,3.5 fd,So far so good. This exteranl floopy drive worked this first time I plugged it in. Plug and play had no issues picking it up. I have had to reinsert some disks a couple of times before they were read. Not sure if it is the disk or the drive; the disks are old and don't have another drive to compare with.
2,Too Overpriced for A Few One Hit (if that) Wonders,"I've got a bunch of this series discs that I bought when they were just issued, it looks like they made a whole bunch more, lol. So I am checking out these songs and at least on this one they are pretty weak. Also it's 19.00 plus 3.oo shipping USED? I'll pass, I believe in a free market but I honestly don't think there are that many people buying discs in this series at those kind of prices. I could get two or three complete albums from these artists for the price of this one compilation. 3 stars for the material on this particular disc and one star for the used price (22.00 delivered the cheapest? Get Real)."
5,I'm sad this is a first book....,"The reason I'm sad this is a first book is that I just finished it, and came here to Amazon to find other books by the same author, only to find out that she hasn't written anything else yet.I was an early fan of Lois McMaster Bujold, and I think that Ms. Wingert has the potential to create a universe as complex in intrigue and character as the Vorkosigan milieu has become.Let's just pray that she isn't a one hit wonder."
5,Give me the next installment,"Humans, both naturalist and stationer, aliens of many types, some mystery and interesting chemistry make this a very good first (on her own) book for Wingert. What starts as a cop story quickly delves into some political intrigue as Rachel (station police) finds herself in the middle of a number of odd incidences in a station where odd is an everyday occurrence. The cast of main characters (2 female, 3 male) is interesting and their interaction and connections to one another are complex. I read it in one sitting and am eagerly awaiting the next."
4,An excellent first book,"I highly enjoyed Grasp the Stars, and as a previous reviewer pointed out, there are several loose-ends that must mean a second book is in the making. The characters are well-developed, and the collisions of human and alien cultures are intriguing. What is also interesting is the open-mindedness about gender/sexual orientation in this future universe. Sometimes writing about such a future helps those of us in the present to reconsider entrenched viewpoints.All in all, I recommend this great first effort and look forward to more of Jennifer Wingert's books."
2,Confused,"I wanted to like this book. Great characters, great universe, great action sequences. Potentially the kind of subtle plot line that takes time to develope and is worth sinking your teeth into a la Robin Hobb. Unfortunately, I am not sure this is going to happen. Either this is a stand alone book that finished way too soon or this is the first in a trilogy that somehow included the first two chapters of the next book. Way to many subplots and characters that somehow seem to get in the authors way so she just either kills them off or forgets about them. I would wait to read this book until the sequel comes out and the pair are reviewed as a whole."
1,Weak Plot,"I was not happy with this book. I had to make myself finish it. The characters were not that interesting and, most importantly, the plot was weak. The plot went back and forth between petty stuff and universe ending stuff, it wasn't tied together very well. There was also a lot of running around hysterically and you were wondering, ""what's the big deal?"" There is a lot of character angst and its hard to figure out where its coming from. My biggest issue was the lack of a central theme, one big issue that is supposed to be dealt with as opposed to 3-4 big issues that are never really addressed."
5,Anarchy shirt,I had tried several tshirt sites before finding this shirt in my size on amazon. Most sites I tried had large or xl as their biggest size. I feel more comfortable wearing preferably a 3x or 4x but those are hard to find so the smallest I will wear is 2x. Anywayz its a good quality shirt. I wear it to work and I've had younger coustomers compliment it and ask me where I got it and I tell them. Anywayz cool product no complaints.\
4,No DHL,"The product is Great! However, I would DHL delivery service as very poor. To their credit Amazon refunded my three day delivery charge. Next time I hope they ship via UPS!Thank you,Charles P Kopera"
3,Good!,This was my first electric shaver. So cannot say how great it is. Though it is good. It took more than 20 days before getting satisfactory results.
2,Shaving has become like wrestling a chainsaw,"I've had my shaveer for about a week and have given it several opportunities to do well. I've worn out 3 Norelco shavers so this was a confident purchase I thought. This razor grabs chunks of flesh and heaves it around the room as if the objective is to destroy my face rather than shave it. I have tried to exercise the utmost care to keep this thing from ripping my face apart, but it continues to do it at least 4 times each shave, and with nothing more happening than just moving to another place on the face. I'm going to decide who my worst enemy is and present it to them as a gift."
3,Good For Price.,"DOES A GOOD JOB,EASY TO CLEAN.THE 7140 TURNS AT MUCH SLOWER RATE THAN MY OLD NORELCO.A BETTER BATTERY IS NEEDED."
1,Disappointing,"This really has been one of the most disappointing things I've purchased through amazon. Major cons ::(1)Shaving time is too much(2)Shaves from the root(bad when someone wants to leave a little stubble). Doesn't have any level setting for leaving a bit stubble.(3)Even after spending so much time, doesn't give a clean shave..leave a few hair here n there.I bought this shaver with high expectations, but honestly I've been disappointed by the results. Not value for money."
3,PLEASANTLY PLEASED,I AM PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT----IT DOES THE JOB I BOUGHT IT FOR.Philips Norelco 7140XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver (Purchased on 09/06/2007)
2,Skin irritation,"I have been using this razor for 2 months and lately I have been getting a lot of irritation and pimples. This razor does not get the stubborn more thick hairs like my old 35$ norelco used to-which I had used for 4 years. If it is not fully charged or plugged in, the razor is hopeless to get a clean shave on a partial charge. I have to go over areas many times."
3,Good but not Great,"This lasted me about two years of in frequent use. It did not give me a very close shave unless i pushed very hard, and when i pushed hard it tended to cut me. I tried both wet and dry shaving and i found that dry worked better but still not as well as i would've liked. It also had severe problems shaving the neck/adam's apple area.However, the blade lasted a long time and it was good for touchup or when in a rush."
3,Not a great shaver,"I had been using the old Norelco 5801XL and it gave a good shave.Unfortunately, after many years - the battery is giving out andlasts about 15-20 minutes. So after reading the reviews here I initially bought the Philips Norelco 6940LC - unaware it is a corded shaver. But that really gives a close shave.Even when you turn it on - you can hear the 7140 is turning slower than the 6940 or 5801. The only way to get a close shave is by pressing hard into the skin with the shaver. And if you are sweaty - forget it. The 6940 or 5801 gave an 80% shave when sweaty whereas the 7140 gives a 50% shave - and I need to go over it later to get a proper close shave."
4,Electric Razor,I am very happy with this Norelco shaver. I recently had purchased a different brand electric razor which did not do the job. This shaver is much better.
4,"Quiet, good shave, good battery","Overall, it's a good razor. It functions and it's very quiet. Sometimes I need to plug it in for extra juice when the battery is low (there is no indicator, you just feel it). It's also very blue."
5,Stone Age........NOT,"Not living in the stone age anymore with my new, Philips Norelco 7140XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver. Very happy smile."
4,Its a good razor.,It works well. I've found it best to use before wiskers get too long.I've gone over 2 weeks on the first charge. A quick shave takes less than a minute and I've had no skin irritation.
4,No long charge,"Gives a good shave, but the charge is good for only 30 minutes. According to the manual you have to charge it for 8 hours. My old one had a charge that lasted me for close to a month, and the charging was done in less than 8 hours."
2,Shaver,It does not work like I thought it would. It leaves hair and you break out with irritation badly. I would not buy again. I will stick with a real razor.
5,Philips 7140 shaver,Better than expected and 100% improvement in shaving ease over my 10 year old one.Philips Norelco 7149 cordelss shaver
4,Good Value,This is my second Norelco rotary style shaver. The first lasted 9 years. This one seems to cut closer with less irritation but is somewhat small for my hands....time will tell if it lasts as long as the first.
5,Excellent value,"It's so quiet that at first it seemed like it must need charging but my first shave with it was as good as any from my previous electric razors. This one replaced a 3 year old Remington triple head that's battery would no longer take a charge. The Remington was on it's third set of heads and probably due for another set. None of it's previous heads had become dull, they just locked up and quit moving. I selected this unit for it's easy cleaning (the easiest cleaning I've ever had) and it's corded capability. Instead of ruining it's battery by constant recharging, I charge it, get about twenty shaves before it quits, plug it in to finish the shave, recharge it for another 20 shaves."
4,Excellent product with great price,Have been using this product for a while. everything looks good except the using time is a little bit short after a full charge.
1,Total piece of junk,"I bought this product from Amazon on June 30th of 2008. It is now January 20th of 2009 and my shaver's battery is dead. It won't start, even when plugged in. The unit is only six months old! My last Norelco unit with a rechargeable battery lasted TEN YEARS.Six months is pathetic.You have been warned."
4,Philips Norelco 7140XL Review,"Upgraded from an old Norelco to this and just love it. Shaves close and almost effortlessly including the very course hair over the upper lip. The only con I see is the 8 hour charge time, which has been the norm for Norelcos in this class for a long time. If you need a very good basic electric shaver for a good price, this is a great choice."
2,Not as good as earlier models,"This product shipped promptly and seemed to be in good condition. However it seems to run much slower than previous models I have used.I charged it for 10 hours before using. I have used Norelco shavers since 1960, and expected this one to be as good. It cuts nicely with no pulling, but just seems to run too slowly."
2,Not quite satisfied with it.,I've had this a few months. It does an OK job but does not feel like it does a good job.The shave does not feel close or neat.
5,Norelco Shaver,I gave this to my Son in Law for Christmas. He loves it. It gives a nice close shave and can be used with or without a cord.
5,This is a GRRRRRRRRRRREAT SHAVER!!!!!!!,"I purchased the Philips Norelco 7140 about a year ago. I LOVE IT!!! I tend to not shave on my days off, but the 7140 still does a great job even with 3 days of growth. The only drawback with this model; even though a charge will last for about 3wks you never know when the battery will run out. I have had NO other issues with this model and highly recommend it."
4,Better than more expensive razor,I was skeptical on the performance but I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and clean shave this shaver gave at such an excellent price. It beat out a more expensive remington shaver which I sent back.
2,I was hoping for an authoritative account of BPD,"This book is probably a good introduction to Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) for someone who is first reading about this disorder. Personally, I was looking for something a little more rigorous and authoritative. The author admits to having no special expertise in the subject, but has interviewed experts and others to arrive at her understanding of BPD. If you're looking for a top-notch, clear and understandable discussion of BPD, I would recommend Marsha Linehan's ""Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder."" It offers an expertly written account by someone who is actively treating borderline patients and is on the cutting edge of the current scientific research on BPD."
5,My favorite story!,My grandma used to read this one to me over and over. I'm now 58 and can't wait to read it to my grandkids. I've been looking for it in flea markets and used book stores and was pleased to find it in print again. It will sure result in a lot of giggles and fun if you read it to your little one.
2,"Just mean, and lacks a moral","Bought book because of rave reviews. Not sure what all the fuss is about. The bear character is just mean with no redeeming qualities. He eventually goes away because he is not successful in his squashing. What's the moral in that story? Meaness sometimes fails to cause the intended damage? The little woodland creatures are just hapless and passive victims of a bully. What's the moral for them? Just keep running until the bully happens to get unlucky, and goes away? My 4-year-old said he did not like the story because the bear is too mean. He agreed we should sell it, and buy another book. I would have given it 1 star, except that the illustrations are nice, in a retro way. If you were introduced to this book title when you bought something else from Purple House Press, consider ""Mr. Pine's Purple House"" or ""Night of the Moonjellies"", which are both excellent."
1,Traumatize your kids.,"Okay. I am a big boy now, but when I was a young boy my mother read this book to my brother and me. Of her reading, I don't remember anything beyond the initial exposition of Mr. Bear's signature move . . . Squashing other animals' homes flat. At that young age, I knew right from wrong and Mr. Bear was very, very wrong in his behavior. I really don't remember any of the ensuing pages, as I was devastated by the totally unacceptable and dangerous manner of the bear.So, go ahead, buy this book and traumatize your kids.If you insist on buying this book, at least read it first and consider that young minds might not bend to nuance as aptly as more mature minds.The Horror!(Update)I recently received a rather vulgar and, I assume, negative comment on my review. I wonder if this comment was inspired by the ""boldness"" of the squatting bear's spirit living itself out in the life of one of this book's almost-adult devotees?"
3,"Good for Background Reading, Bad for Recommendations","I completely agree with the ""Knitting Fiend"" below. Reading this book before going was a joy, especially the stories about the families who own these cafes, the luminaries who frequented them, and so forth. But almost without exception they were poor places to actually visit: far too touristy, overpriced, super crowded (these places must be recommended the world over!) and, most shockingly, they had BAD COFFEE!!! Was the author off base, or have things changed dramatically since he visited? Who knows? The best advice, sad to say, is simply to avoid all the places he writes about. (NOTE: The same applies times two to Wolff's ""Cafe Life Rome."" Never have I been steered to such bad, tourist ripoffs. Read the book, but leave it at home and follow your nose!)"
2,Don't weigh down your luggage with this book!,"This book is more of a storey book than a guide to use when you are in Florence. I went to one gelateria and two caffe's out of this book and all weren't that great, more tourist traps than hidden gems. I wish this book would give some idea of prices, because a few of the places we checked out (but didn't order) had ridiculous prices. If you want a wonderful food guide to Florence, check out Emily Wise-Miller's Food Lover's Guide to Florence, it is excellent."
5,A Most Practical Book about the Most Influential Man!,"This book picks apart the gospel of Mark to analyze the life of Jesus and how he was influential. It teaches you how to be influential in many areas of your life, including your job, your family life, and your relationships with other people. I have read it several times and recommended it to many friends."
4,Good Southern Book!,I enjoyed this book and think it should have gotten more attention. It is a great book about the south. It is also written by my father.
4,Different stuff,Glad to find a Ventures album that was not 50% songs on other albums. One Way Ticket is my favorite cut.
5,Energy & Society,"Excellent book...even decades after the original text, it is amazing how forward looking and accurate the thesis is about the realities of our energy future."
4,some lost music gems,"I purchased this cd because of Ethel Beatty song it's your love, one of my all time favorite songs.But i was suprised to find that Sylvia Striplin's you can't turn me away was on there also. I love that song to. To me those songs are gems, real music! Very hard to find."
1,Falling Behind !,"I'm the reviewer from Kansas City, MO. I've used this book for 2 years, but am now switching to the Laudon textbook. The McLeod text is just not keeping up with the times, he needs a strong rewrite."
3,Tough Subject,"This book does an average job of presenting what is somewhat 'deadly boring' material. Considering what they have to work with, maybe this is the best we could expect."
3,Tired rehash,"This CD is nothing but a recycling of selected tracks from the OBC recordings of Comden and Green's various B'way shows --- On the Town, Wonderful Town, Bells Are Ringing, etc. In its favor are the inclusion of numbers from lesser known shows --- Peter Pan and Twentieth Century, for instance --- but, on the down-side, most of those so-included numbers are supremely forgettable. Much better buys, if you're into C&G, would be the ""Perform Their Own Songs"" DRG Theater CD; or the Blossom Dearie Sings C&G, on Verve."
1,A Worst-Case Example of Radical Feminism,"I found this book while browsing in the stacks of my university library, and out of curiosity read it cover to cover. I literally could not believe what I found. From her disjointed account of her own ""craziness"" to her infantile analysis of masculine motives, Joyce T.'s book is one of the worst I have read in my life. Never in my wildest dreams would I recommend that anyone pay a cent for this book. I would, however, recommend that everyone read it, if only to expose the far left wing of radical feminism for what it really is."
1,Don't Even think about it,The item is not worth a penny. It's like a thin small paper. I threw it in the trash. Not recommended at all.
5,Yum!,"This is a great and delicious way to eat Thia food at home. Just ""melt"" the entire packet (if you like it spicy) into two cans of coconut milk in a pan. Then add your favorite meat and veggies. I usually use chicken strips and a bag of frozen asian veggies."
2,Just not very good,"People love this book, looking at the other reviews! I wanted to, but just couldn't. The plot, the dialogue, the characterizations... all seemed shallow and not compelling at all. I thought the quality of the writing itself was actually quite bad."
1,Simple and Predictable,"I purchased ""The Pheonix"" based on the overwhelmingly good reviews that it recieved online. Much to my dismay, I was thoroughly dissappointed. The characterization was shallow and the plot was <yawn> predictable. In addition, it reads like a book with a storyline intended for adults but wrote for eight grade students. The simple descriptions did not inspire me to care what happened to Kit or Nick. The author would choose to write ""Nick was happy"" . . when there are so many more expressive ways to describe his joy at being reunited with his soulmate and one true love. If you enjoy a novel where the characters become real people and not just names on a page, do not read this book. However, if you would prefer to read a book that requires no thought and can easily be read while watching TV, this IS the book for you."
2,Puppy loved it but it didn't last long.,My 4 month old Morkie puppy loved the taste of this but it only lasted about 1/2 hour. The product didn't say it was for a puppy but I thought I'd try it to see if it would be good for her teething. I was sure hoping it would last a little longer so don't know if I'll be buying them again. She did enjoy that 1/2 hour so at least it wasn't a total waste of money. Don't know how the description can say it is long lasting though. I do like that it is more natural than nylabones just wish it lasted longer.
2,pupper nutter,My puppy loved this product but they made him sick. I ordered a couple of packages and will not use them again.
1,CONFUSED & DECEIVED,"Peter Payne is one very confused man. Though he acknowledges that Satan took possession of his mind while he was mentally and spiritually incapacitated by marijuana, he claims that Christ helped him to overcome this evil. However, this ""Chist"" is not the Christ recognized by any true Christian, but a demonic distortion. This could be a dangerous book if anyone were foolish enough to take it seriously, and, unfortunately, there are lots of nincompoops out there capable of doing so. CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA is an evil book, Payne should be pitied and prayed for rather than despised. I recommend that born again Christians read this book, precisely because it so clearly delineates the deceptive powers of Satan. We must better understand the enemy if we are to successfully fight him!"
4,They work well,"Nothing amazingly special, they do connect but its a loser fit than i had hoped so they fall apart easily, but once you have water in one side, and food in the other, the weight of the content keeps them together anyways. I still use them for my cats, but changed out the bowls for my dog."
2,Got it dirt Cheap here.,That is about all I can say about the album. They still have some tight grooves.
3,Calm Down,"Alright, take a deep breath. And listen.Yes, they're cool.Yes, they have style.Yes, they have talent.But the distcance between that and calling them ""the best"" and ""fresh"" is F-A-R!I like them, they're a talented bunch. But I don't see anything original about them. They've got the tools, got the rhymes and got the look - but what are they contributing? What's ""fresh"" about them?..Nothing.Buy this if you like pattern, if you like the usual in Rap-Core, Funk-Metal and the likes.Don't but this if you're looking for an original work of art.Sorry."
2,Seems pretty cheaply made for Prada...,"...in fact, I actually returned mine because it didn't come with the little black tag on the side zipper as seen in the pictures. I think I probably would have returned it anyway, though. There's no lining on the inside (just seams from the vinyl), and it's not as large as it appears in the photos. I would pass on this one, unless the price drops to about $20, because it looks like I spent about that much."
1,A complete waste of my hard earned pay .,"This lens is slow, noisy, and soft. I struggle to find enough light for long focal length shots. The noise of the auto-focus annoys me so much I wonder if the internal parts aren't grinding into pieces. And I've yet to take a photo that's sharp and acceptable - they are all incredibly soft. The focus is so bad I wonder if there might be a problem with the specific combination of my Canon 20D and this lens. I've shot a few hundred pictures with this lens and not one has been worth printing. It's become an expensive paperweight. The 20D's kit lens takes better photos."
3,Great 28-100!,This lens is great for an amateur or student.Works great from 28 to 100 mm after that quality fail. oh and is just for day or outdoor pictures because is too dark to shoot indoor without flash.you get what you pay!
4,Tamron AF 28-300mm Nikon mount,This has become my day to day lens for everyday shooting. The quality of the images has been good so far. I have not found any usability problems.
3,BUYERS BEWARE,"Once again, another cheap plastic lens from Tamron, including the PLASTIC LENS MOUNT! Save your money and buy the 18-250mm lens for another 100 bucks. You lose a whopping 50mm at the long end, but the optics and build are superior plus a gain on the short end.If you don't want to spend that much then consider the Sigma 28-300mm, unfortunatly the optics are a bit less than the Tamron 28-300mm, but the build quality is definitely superior. Of course this review is NOT for the VC version of this lens which is far superior in build and worth another 200 + dollars in price."
2,300mm Blur,DONT BUY!!!!!I was looking for an all around lens. So I thought this 28 to 300mm would do the trick. The problem is (BAD GLASS) Even if you have this lens on a tripod the 250-300 looks blurry. So take it from me. Save up more money and buy GOOD GLASS which this is NOT!!!! My canon kit lens is better than this. 18-135mm
4,Glad I bought it !,"Finally decided to buy this lens for my Canon 20D and after 1000 shots of all types I know I made the right choice for a lens I don't have to change all the time.There's no subsitute for a few prime lenses of known good quality when you know what you are after and don't mind taking them all with you, but for this price, the Tamron is a little gem IMO. f2.8 would be nice... but at what price ?I reserve 5 stars for something near perfect and that is mighty hard to achieve for anything IMO 8-) 4 stars makes me very happy though..Just wanted to add this .... This was the quickest rebate return I ever applied for ! The way it SHOULD be for all of them 8-) BTW, now over 2000 shots taken with this lens and I'm still happy.Update: Now at over 6000 shots taken and it's still a gem to own ! No problems to report."
3,Maybe I'm Asking Too Much,"For the $, the lens is a good value. It has a great range, but with most DSLRs, the 1.6 crop factor means that while it is a great telephoto lens (up to 480mm equiv.), and it lacks in the wide angle department (45mm equiv.). My chief complaint is its lack of sharpness at anything over 28mm. Definitely not a fast lens; I shoot at 400-1600 ISO way more than I thought I would. If you only want one lens, and don't mind a bit of extra weight, this is not a bad compromise."
2,"Versatile, but lacks sharpness","I bought this lens because it's very inexpensive and compact. The 28-300mm zoom gives a lot of versatility. I'd give up some of that versatility for better image sharpness. I have a Canon 28-135mm lens that knocks to socks off the Tamron lens for image quality. The Tamron is also quite noisy. I remember a couple instances of trying to shoot some birds. As soon as I depressed the shutter button half way to focus, the birds flew off, startled by the raucous noise of the lens focusing. I still pack my Tamron along for trips for the zoom factor, but I'm thinking of the Canon 75-300mm lens that goes for around $400. I own several Canon lenses and you just can't go wrong for image quality. I think it's worth the extra bucks for Canon quality."
2,Short on sharpness and focus capability,"Sure I'm an ""L"" snob I suppose, but I wanted to try the Tamron to see if I could just carry one lens on an upcoming trip. The lack of sharpness and ability to focus in a rather large depth of field were among the short list of things I didn't like right away. I shot pictures at a wedding for a friend...and was VERY disapointed. This morning, I tried one more experiment, catching a blue jay out in our oak tree. Could hardly tell the blue jay from the tree at 70 mm. It was just a black blob. I pulled out the L and did the same shot with crystal clarity.The lens is easy to use, light weight, and as others have said...if you don't require the sharpness...it is a perfect lens for the price."
5,great all around len,"great lens for both closeups & far away, lite weight lens , for when your walking around , or standing aound ,you don't have to carry a bunch of differents lens with you to change out. Really easy to use.i bought the wife a camera with that lens on ,& like it so much I went and bought me the same len.Real fast shipping."
4,Tamron all purpose 28-300 zoom,"This is a good all purpose lens. The 28 - 300 mm zoom equates to approximately 42 - 450 mm on most DSLR's. There are almost always tradeoffs in anything you buy and this is very true with lenses. This lens provides a wide zoom range, has a minimum length of 3.3"" and weighs about 1 lb. It is not very fast with a maximum aperture of F 3.5 at 28 mm and 6.3 at 300mm but when used with a Pentax K10D the automatic focus works well under most lighting conditions. I use it primarily for nature photography. It has produced good images in most situations. Although it focuses to 1.6 feet throughout the zoom range, to provide a 2.9 magnification ratio at 300 mm, the short depth of field results in disappointing close-up shots. Overall I am pleased with the Tamron AF28-300 and would recommend it to anyone that wants one lightweight lens to cover a wide zoom range."
5,Delivers as promised and better than expected,I mated this lens to the new Canon XTI and am very pleased. Crisp and clear pictures from the center to the edges. This is the third Tamron lens I've owned and they never dissapoint.
4,Glad I bought it !,"Finally decided to buy this lens for my Canon 20D and after 1000 shots of all types I know I made the right choice for a lens I don't have to change all the time.There's no subsitute for a few prime lenses of known good quality when you know what you are after and don't mind taking them all with you, but for this price, the Tamron is a little gem IMO. f2.8 would be nice... but at what price ?Edit; Now with over 12,000 shots with this lens and still happy owner. As good as the ""best"" lenses out there ? No.. but look at the price."
1,Check with your ISP first,"After trying everything to get this to work, it came down to getting the required setup info from my ISP. Their position was ""we can give you the information for the modems we sell, but we have no information on yours..sorry""D-Link's position was "" you have to get that information from your ISP or else you cannot use this product."""
2,Disappointing,"The reason for purchasing this product was the inclusion of multiple functions in one device to simplify my home network. Most of the features offered are extensive and beyond what I was expecting; however, there is an issue with the wireless feature on the one I purchased. The wireless devices could connect to the Access Point, but they could not access the internet, due to what looked like a DNS service failure. The LAN features worked perfectly.My original Access Point is a DI-624 and that is my reference for a comparison. The wireless range on the DSL-G604T is better; although the connection speed is slower. There are many more advanced setup features on the DSL-G604T that I do not require; although I like the inclusion of the ADSL modem.If the wireless portion had worked, then my overall satisfaction would have been much better. As I can't use the wireless feature, the DSL-G604T is pretty much useless to me."
2,Eh...,"The sauce is far too sweet for my taste, and it's too difficult to adequately mix the ingredients in the box (you have to dig down to the bottom of the box to get everything stirred, and if you don't get it stirred right -- as I didn't -- you wind up with chunks of sauce glop sticking to the noodles).Thai Kitchen makes a much better tasting version, with better packaging (a plastic bowl instead of a tall carton)."
3,"Meh, it's okay",There are no chunks of veggies in the sauce or anything. Just some kind of salty sauce. Plus a peanut packet. It's not bad; it just isn't really pad thai or that intersting. The Ka-Me noodle boxes are more interesting.
2,Expected more,We live in the wilds of Michigan so I was hoping to fins a product that would approximate a Thai experience. This is too many carbs for one person and it didn't taste like Thai food.
3,very poor sound,"Yeah its a great live mix, with some awesome skills behind the decks, but the recording is quite ordinary. Sounds like some guy stood in the crowd with a tape recorder.It would get a 4.5 / 5 if the sound was fixed up."
3,Good but not original,"Although this is a well-written and gripping story, I'm surprised by how similar it is to WATERSHIP DOWN, by Richard Adams. This includes the plot, with the prophecy, the long journey, the deer raised and culled by humans, and the battles between deer tribes; the structure of the deer society, with its militaristic Draila (""Owsla"" in WATERSHIP DOWN) and its language and folklore (along with the trickster hero); and even the ending. I'm especially surprised that Richard Adams endorsed this book on the back cover, but, as the saying goes, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so he must be very flattered. All in all, this is a good book and a worthwhile read, but WATERSHIP DOWN fans shouldn't be shocked if the story seems oddly familiar."
4,A Can't Miss Fantasy For Everyone,"Fire Bringer is a rousing anthropomorphic fantasy that is sure to appeal to readers of all ages. It has all of the elements of a standard fantasy story (a prophesy to be fulfilled, a villain with a secret past, a hero that ignores his destiny and then embraces it). However, instead of being formulaic, Clement-Davies uses these elements to build strong characters, powerful action sequences, and evocative settings that will linger with the reader. The vigorous writing makes it easy for readers to imagine themselves in the world that the author has created.This book would make a wonderful introduction to the fantasy field for a first-time reader of the genre. However, even long-time fantasy readers will find enjoyment reading this auspicious debut from Clement-Davies."
3,"can you say, ""rip off of Watership Down""?","this used to be my favorite book, but i was dissapointed after reading watership down. it was so obvious that this was based on it. and the prophecy was sort of lame."
2,"Choking on ""for""","If you're picky about writing style or easily annoyed by authors' writing tics, you might want to read a chapter of this in the bookstore before you buy it. For you might get as annoyed as I did, and think you wasted your money if you buy this book. For Clement-Davies really likes starting sentences with the word ""for."" For he apparently thinks that it makes some sentences sound really important, when it really just makes it seem like they were chopped off from the previous sentence.It really got on my nerves."
3,Interesting reading,"I was looking for something in the lines of Watership Down and someone recommeded this book. It was an interesting book blending fiction and fact about herds of deer, all coming under the twisted rule of a cruel dictator called Sgorr. A deer with a special mark is born, leading many to wonder if he isn't the one foretold by a prophecy regarding a stag who would free the herds from the evil domain that is spreading through the land. I found myself wanting to read more, wondering what would happen next, although I wouldn't exactly call it suspenseful. If you have read Watership Down you'll find that in the end you've become rather fond of the characters. This didn't happen with Fire Bringer though. Had some creepy references to human sacrifice and pagan rituals, but in general was an interesting book. I must warn about the typeface used in the paperback edition: it is quite small and I resorted to using a magnifying glass to read the book, but oh well..."
4,"A tad slow to start, but worth it.","I've always considered stories of sentient animals to be an intriguing concept, which piqued my interest in this book.Though Fire Bringer did feel rather slow for the first few chapters, I decided to stick with it and I'm glad I did; the second half of the book turned out to be quite gripping!To be fair, I did notice a number of the cliches mentioned in other reviews, but they didn't really detract from the book as much as I thought they might. The story remained interesting all the way through.I suppose my admiration of deer might've helped as well..."
5,excellent and shocking,"As a fan of Watership Down and all tales of animals, this book naturally appealed to me. I was pleasantly surprised at how gripping it is from the first chapter. The story goes down paths so horrible and dark I found myself caught up in the terror felt by the characters. Excellent read, and can't wait for more!"
4,Great Epic Tale!,"Have you ever wondered about what it's like to be a deer? Then you should read Fire Bringer.It all starts out when a fawn is born with an oak-leaf fawn mark on his forehead. This is the first sign of the Prophecy, an ancient legend about a deer who would end the wars between deer. His name is Rannoch and he's out to protect deer from Sgorr, a brutal lord among deer. Rannoch goes on a quest to find his inner self and find out more about the mysterious Prophecy. What will he discover about Sgorr and the Prophecy? You'll have to read Fire Bringer to find out.This book is very exciting the whole way through. Even though it's long, you won't want to stop reading it. You'll feel like you're Rannoch and see through the eyes of a deer. At first, Fire Bringer is confusing, but once you get into the book, it will be hard to break away."
2,"Pierce first, then Clement-Davies","I was very excited about this book until I started noticing too many references to Meredith Ann Pierce's ""Firebringer Trilogy"", a series about unicorns. I would recommend that if you enjoyed David Clement-Davies book, you should find Pierce's series and compare. The first book ""Birth of the Firebringer"" came out around 1987 if I am not mistaken. All the books have been reprinted since. While Clement-Davies Fire Bringer is an interesting read, you begin to look at it with suspicion after reading Pierce. ""Fire Bringer"" is still worth reading, especially if you like stories about deer, as I do.The Firebringer Trilogy (Birth of the Firebringer, Dark Moon, The Son of Summit Stars)"
3,"Not bad, but not wonderful either.","The story is good, if not particularly original, and I do like the use of non-humans as main charactors... HOWEVER. This book could be about -any- species of mammal. Change the few deer-specific facts strewn through-out the book and it could be about horses, or wolves, or foxes, or humans.I am much more fond of non-human charactors who -act- in non-human ways. Not deer that form totalitrian governments, spawn twisted Cults, and otherwise act as much unlike deer as possible.This was the same problem I had with Watership Down, so it's gone on my bookshelf under the 'loan to friends' catagory. It's good enough to warrent one read-through, but on repeat reading the un-deerness starts to get annoying.Ah well, could have been a -lot- worse. ^_^"
5,TRULY TOUCHED,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. I WAS TRULY TOUCHED IN MANY WAYS. THEY DON'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS. I HOPE TO SEE THIS TRANSLATED TO FILM SOMETIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THIS WILL APPEAL TO ALL AGES AND - IT IS A STORY FOR THE AGES. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK FROM THIS GIFTED WRITER. THANK YOU DAVID CLEMENT-DAVIES!!!
5,Fire Bringer,"This was an excellent book. I have found that I love all anthropmorphic books. I had been searching for a book that would be equal to the Redwall series, by Brian Jacques. I thought that this quality would be hard to reach, but when I saw this book in the book store and bought it, I was soon proved wrong as I began to read it. This is a lot better than the Redwall series. Fire Bringer is an amazing book that everyone should read even if they like animals only the slightest bit. I greatly anticipate his next novel."
4,My Son and I agree This is a Super Novel,My 14 year old son read this book first then I read it a few weeks later. We both agreed that this was a super novel. It's my understanding that Fire Bringer is the author's first novel and all I can report is that he did and excellent job of telling a wonderful story. It is original and different from many of the animal stories on the market. Although the story is about a deer the level of writing makes this story attractive to both young adults and mothers like me. We both agreed that this book rates right up there with Harry Potter and I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone. A great read.
4,Fired Tale,Fire bringer is a truely well writen anthropomorphic tale centering on the deer in Scottland. They have been lead astray by a poor leader and have a prophecy predicting a deer with a leaf of oaken to lead them back to the way of Herne. The book is weel done with several unexpected twists. I would recommend this to any fantasy reader.
3,not Watership Down but interesting,"The premise is interesting and the story begins well, but if you are a fan of Watership Down and other more naturalistic characters, this will be disappointing. At times the deer display far too human characteristics... they smile...how does a deer smile?? Much of the middle of the book sounds like it was added as filler to make the book longer rather than as an integral part of the plot, which gets tedious after a while; things begin to sound forced. The good guys have no flaws and the bad guys have no redeeming qualities; too ""perfect"" a world."
1,Fire Bringer by David Clement Davies,"I bought this book after reading its sequel, The Sight, which was an amazing novel that touched my heart. After seeing the reviews for Fire Bringer, apparently even better than the Sight, my mind was made up. I went to the bookstore and purchased Fire Bringer.But my opinion was the opposite of those of other reviewers; Fire Bringer was a disatisfying read that droned on and on and on for what seemed like forever.I've read countless animal novels, and I'm amazed to find that the author who wrote my favourite, The Sight, was also capable of writing my worst, Fire Bringer.Lucky I read the latter first, because if I had read this story before I'd have neglected all ideas of reading anything alse by David C-D. Do read the Sight, it's far better than Fire Bringer, unworthy of any praise."
2,Useful book but very uneaven,"I bought this book in order to get a good overview of the J2EE platform. I was looking for a book that would summarize the first level of technical detail on the technologies of the J2EE platform and their interplay. The first few chapters useful for the component overview. Beyond that, I found that I was better off getting my information from other books. The chapters vary widely in quality and substance. Some sections deal with broad truisms and generalities, while others dive deeply into coding related details.This definitely feels like a book written by committee."
4,A Cool Java Resource,"As an intermediate software developer and a rookie in JAVA, I found this book helpful to understand how different JAVA modules and features interact for developing an end-to-end enterprise application."
5,Great Book,I thought this book did a great job covering the J2EE concepts. Some chapters were better than others but I think that everyone that is building J2EE applications should read this book (or most of the chapters) at least once. I made it a required reading for members of my development team.It talks about the Pet Store application written by Sun which is a great example to learn from. It is also valuable for people that are interested in moving to EJB. (Talks about a Web centric approach vs. EJB centric.) I think that this book is a must read!
4,A little dated.. but still invaluable,This book would have been the prime book for J2EE developers a couple of years ago but its past that now. Yet there are some valuable tips .. buy it if you have the spare change.
3,Download it first,"I found this book very patchy. Well written in some places and badly written in others, e.g. chapter three is written by someone who has just learnt English, shocking. Whereas chapter five is excellent. Anyway, why buy this book you can download it from Sun ?"
2,Good for intro,"Does a good job with the JSP and Servets but minimal on the EJB design. Nothing too much on the reality of integrating with existing systems, messaging(JMS), and when not to use EJB's, JSP,or Servlets."
4,"Interesting, I downloaded this book...","...from java.sun.com back in March. Amazingly, the PDF is no longer on Sun's web site. My copy is copyrighted, of course, but I'm sure the PDF is floating around out there somewhere.Nonetheless, a very good book. I guess that's why they published it."
4,Good intentions & the pursuit of happiness,"What happens when loving intentions result in disastrous outcomes? Iris Murdoch's, The Good Apprentice, features gothic ancestral dwellings, a trio of eccentric women, peculiar, seedy London séances, modern psychiatry, upper-class contemporary love affairs and infidelity, intense family relationships and questing for worthy missions in order to justify individual lives. I didn't easily breeze through this book neither could I put it down. Murdoch's heavy philosophical background is excruciatingly evident. However, I knew I was in the hands of a great artist when I laughed out loud with delight in passages. I look forward to reading more of her writing."
3,Lesser Murdoch,"Often intriguing but more often a slog. I couldn't stand Midge or Harry--no one is this clueless, unless they've been institutionalized, and I couldn't stand Jesse or any of the characters at Seegard (these really are not fully developed characters). In fact, I sighed whenever the story left London. The book has a truly compelling set up that one wishes she'd resolved more succinctly."
3,Merely average,"Not a bad recording, but certainly not a great one either. Guilini and La Scala fare better with no.1 which is taken at a lighter, brisker pace and which brings out all the genius of the young Beethoven. No. 7 doesn't quite hold together, and although there are moments of power and distinction, as a whole it doesn't really move. It sounds heavy, like the whole piece is sort of dragging along. The dance-like nature of the piece seems to be lost, and while I generally am a fan of Guilini, there are many Sevenths out there far better. Try Ashkenazy and the Philharmonia (on Decca with the Fifth), or Bernstein and Vienna Philharmonic (on DG with the Fourth)."
5,Now that I feel so good.......tell everybody,"...tell everybody that this is an amazing cd....Seriously, you will never know until you actually listen to it. Even my husband, a sceptic when it comes to old school music, agrees with me that this album is the bomb. This is an amazing album. My father had it (mom hated it!!! because of the noise dad & i made with it) but gosh I absolutely loved it. I listened to it alongside Fandango by Herb Alpert. Very many years later, I ordered for it and have had no regrets whatsoever. It transports me to a different place. Don't you just find it amazing when you hear music like this and it feels so right?"
1,It sucked,"At first, it was wonderful and felt amazing but it broke after a good week of having it. All the pieces fell out of the holder and now it is useless!"
2,Too Stiff,"Seems like the cheaper one my girlfriend has with weaker tines is kinder to your head. Although, this one will likely survive the apocalypse."
3,stiff but works,I like this head massager more than my husband. It is very stiff so I could see how it would be uncomfortable on a tender scalp.
3,Fair.,I initially bought this for myself but ended up giving it as a gift--wasn't at nice as one I'd tried in a mall years ago.
1,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Purchased 3 from the UNWINDING CO.,one for myself and two for gifts. when recieved, i was totally dissatisfied.Thought they were cheaply made.. I wanted to return the two that i DID NOT OPEN and keeped the one that i tried.(now in the junk drawer).. Waiting for my refund, i called this company and they said they could not refund any money because the two boxes were opened .LIARS !!!Why would i open all three boxes .LOUSEY CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! Will dispute with my credit card co.Buyer BEWARE...."
2,I'm surprised,"Okay, I tried this thing in Las Vegas, and I thought I was going to have a male gasm in the story in felt so good, I have been messing with this thing for two week now, and I don't know what is up, it does not work for me like it did in the store, I'm sad because it felt SOOOO good the first time I tried it, I am not sure if it is exactly the same and since I live in the midwest, i am not going all the way to Planet Hollywood hotel to experience the magic again.sorry :("
2,Disappointed,Product was not as I expected.I thought it would be a more sensual experience. Tried a few more times but with same results.
1,NOT what it claims to be or do~,This thing was a waste of my 10 bucks plus another 6 or so in shipping and handling. It is poorly designed and it amazes me anyone who has ever tried this product did not pass on the info that it is not that great to their friends and relatives who would even think about throwing their money away on it.
2,Why Did God Give You Fingers?,"I purchased one of this product for myself, and one as a gift for a friend. I honestly don't know what everyone is so excited about. It's an interesting novelty, I suppose, but why would you use a bunch of metal prongs to massage your scalp if you can use your fingers? Am I missing something?I gave this product two stars because it is an interesting novelty item, and because it can attract a lot of attention from the neighbors if you stick it on your head and wear it out to pick up the newspaper or the mail - makes you look like your head is receiving alien transmissions. That's worth a star right there.But if you really want a head massage, just save your money and use your fingers. That's what they're there for."
1,Mother's Day Gift Broke,"I purchased this head tingler for my mother as a Mother's Day gift. Though it originally worked great. After only a day a prong had fallen out, and today (about week after she received it). All of the prongs have fallen out, and can't be put back in. Currently I'm seeking a refund for the product. I wouldn't recommend buying this."
3,"Tines pack for travel - a bummer, actually","How many people travel w a tingly head scratcher? I am not sure, but I sure don't. If you do - congrats, this is for you. Otherwise, this is a good product except that if you get into working yourself over (or w a partner), the tines split a bit and clump together. In short, the 8 tines end up like about 4-6 tines in no time. That being said, I am led to believe that they tingler is fully successful at what it does."
5,classic maynard!,Classic Maynard. I like this recording because it is of a live event. Not the crispness and cleanliness of a studio album. But that's not what I was looking for. I like to hear Maynard giving props to the players after the song and I like the energy of the live performance. My favorite song is Coconut Champagne.
4,You'll Like It,"The First ""Album"" In Maynard's Post DISCO Years. Band Has Great Energy & Is Fun To Listen To. Please Don't Sing Maynard! (Only One Tune). ENJOY!.....HEY! When Are Those MF HORN Era CD's Comin Out?????"
2,Worst album in my collection,"I have this CD and I would probably rate it as the worst CD in my entire collection. Why? It is just noise--hard thumping beats, lazy playing, just dreadful.Obviously this is a minority point of view and I see that other reviewers rate it very highly, but if you are thinking of buying it, it would pay you to listen to the samples before making any decision."
4,If you like Maynard then you should definitely have this,"this is perhaps the best MF cd i have ever heard. This cd provides great arrangments, mainly by Dennis DiBlasio, and extend from funk, chant, latin, to hardcore bebop. The excitement picks up heavily on Coconut Champagne, one of my new favorite latin songs of all time. The song comes hard with an extremely exciting bari sax solo and an amazing drum solo by the always impressive greg bissonette. lush life provides a very maynard outlook on a slow and beautiful ballad. south 21st shuffle provides a nice little bluesy tune. the highlight of the entire cd for me is bebop buffet, with an variety of bebop songs put into one. the trombone solos provide some of the best sounding 'bones you might ever hear. and finally, the cd gives maynard and dennis a chance to sing on a hilarious, yet absolutely fun version of sunny side of the street. its too bad he didnt hit that one note on the song though. all in all, you should buy this albulm."
4,Better Than His Later Albums,"Maynard was at his highest level of musicianship during the MF Horn years, including the Chameleon album. The disco/studio recordings he made after Chameleon were just commercialized junk. I remember buying the albums as they came out and found myself being very disappointed. This Live from San Fran album reminds me of the great bands he had in the 1970's. This is probably one of the last recordings when Maynard used 2 bones and 3 saxophones. It was a joy to hear an MF ""full-sized"" band, again. Maynard's performance is strong. For some reason, this album reminds me of MF Horn 3."
2,Boring,"What a dry, boring, theoretical book. Okay in all honesty it has tons of fancy terms, and great diagrams, but its dry as heck. I wouldn't recommend it if you just want to learn how to run projects. If you are going for your PMI certification, then you'll want it, but for real life projects that don't take a year to do, there are better books."
3,Ok Book...,"Unless you are taking a project management class or studying for the Project Management Certificate through PMI, I wouldn't suggest this book. The book only covers the basic concepts of project management."
2,"Tries to describe it all, falls short","I first encountered this one doing a master's in Environmental Engineering, now considering whether it is worth pursuing a PMP. This is the book for it (though now there is newer edition). Still undecided if I will pursue PMP, as it is a big time commitment, expensive to test, and also license renewal not cheap. Also not necessarily a benefit to my career or salary.The book seems more appropriate to a project manager in the electronics/software/industrial field, as many of the topics seem almost theoretical from my background in civil engineering. Studying for the PMP would require memorizing allot of this dribble from what I can tell, without necessarily making me a better engineer.So, I would not recommend this book unless you need to do the PMP. If you are in the civil field, as there are better assets out there, which you could use as reference in planning a project. Not this one."
4,Torchbearer,"This is the 3rd edition of the Guide to the PMBOK, though the name may mislead you as this IS the PMBOK.Project Management has been an evolving practice and PMI has been the pioneers in bringing in some form, structure, and discipline -which was much needed-to the field of project management.Before the 1st edition of the Guide to PMBOK, practioners were not even using a common lexicon to explain similar concepts/ideas.What the Guide to PMBOK has achived is:-bringing in an aspect of science to project management-forging a process view to project management-establish a common lexicon of parlence for practioners to share ideas and practices-list out the various knowledge areas that a project manager has to be wary about and interact with his/her job as a project managerThe 3rd edition to the Guide to PMBOK has a few consolidation of project management processes, though there can be a few improvements, especially the block diagrams and figures."
1,One of the most poorly written books EVER,"Hands down, this is THE worst-written book of any kind, ever. My brain totally objects to reading sentences such as, ""The project manager will have to be careful that the project manager does not make mistakes that will make it difficult for the project manager to manage the project."" Think I'm kidding -- hey, no one could make this stuff up. After reading three or four sentences in a row like this, I was ready to fall off my chair, or else go beat my head against the wall. And who came up with the title: ""Book of Knowledge"". Sounds almost religious, or else like something they'd come up with in a Star Trek movie. Sheesh. Get it because you have to, but get thee -- quick -- to additional guides to help yourself pass the PMP exam."
4,exactly what was needed..,The book is mandatory reading for the PMP exam. It's written quite well and an easy read dispite the subject matter that most would find really boring.
2,Oh my,"You have to have this book, so comparison shopping is a little unfair. It does lay out the material, but many other independent review books do it much better, in better formats, better writing, better everything. Bite the bullet, you need this book. But I suggest you pair it up with somebody elses review to interpret this one!"
2,Serves its purpose fairly,Any project management professional will appreciate this book for what it is. If your desire is to take the PMP certification test this is the standard.As usual the PMI material assumes that one size will fit all. Nothing could be farther from the truth. There seems to be little evidence to support much of the theory or methodology.There is little value here for the knowledgeable PM.
4,"A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, Third Edition (PMBOK)","This text was purchased to prepare for a certified PMP prep course offered by a local University. The material is rather dry, however it contains the bulk of the material that is fairplay for the examination. Suggestion to anyone looking at this book is to also purchase an additional test prep resource with example questions in mock exam format, as it will help to interpret the material and provide you real-time feedback as to your grasp on the information."
1,Do NOT buy this book!!!,"I really, really wish I would have read through the amazon reviews before buying this book. It looks like a good idea and that it will an informative read. It's a piece of summary junk that provides no real value whatsoever.Instead of actually trying to teach concepts in detail, the objective of this book appears to be the mere identification of concepts. If you're content learning about the concepts that exist, maybe this book is for you. If you want to actually know how things work and be able to do them yourself, go elsewhere."
3,Necessary reading for the PMP certification,"This book is a description of the Project Management Institute's standards. It is an interesting albeit long read with a lot of information packed into its roughly 400 pages. I had to read it 3 times in order to better understand the PMI's methodology.If you have some project management experience, and want to take the PMP certification test, you will have to read this book. However, I would recommend that you supplement your reading with books focused on preparation for the PMP exams/tests.If you are new to project management, and want to take the PMP certification test, I recommend that before reading this book, you read a beginner's guide such as the Complete Idiot's Guide to Project Management by Sunny Baker."
2,Required Reading - you'll need lots of caffeine to keep awake,"I am studying project management - this book would never be my choice. It is required reading for the course, not only is it extremely dry, boring but repetitive. I understand the necessity for using this book, since it is the PMBOK, but readers beware... a large pot of coffee is required!"
3,"Most boring book you can read, Good for reference","You cannot really read this book. You can use it as a reference, very comprehensive. Must read other book for learning the basics, then use this as a reference for comprehensive guide."
3,It could have been more interesting,This book is really like a document of standards and one can figure out that it's a product a big committee of experts. It lacks good examples and perhaps is meant only for passing the PMP exam. I wonder how much can be used in real life.
3,PMBOK: Read in Bed,"If you're pursuing a certification from the Project Management Institute (PMI) you'll need this book. While it's not a thriller, it does painfully and tediously touch on all areas of project management. When you join PMI you do receive a copy of this book - on CD... read your screen or hit print... purchasing this edition may be an easier solution.I'm Joseph Phillips, author of several books on project management, including The PMP Study Guide. While I think my book is excellent, this is still a title you'll need to refer to - regardless of any additional study aids you purchase. Best in your certification endeavors!"
2,"Good idea, horrible book","Let me start by saying that I did study the book along with other study materials, took the PMP exam and passed. Having some organized body to professionally certify project managers is a good idea. However, this book flat out stinks. It's incredibly wordy and makes simply concepts way too complex. That seems to be a major flaw with the entire PMI model. They are trying to make project management a science. It's not.That being said, the certification process is worth your time. I did learn a lot. Just don't become a ""PMI Junkie"". Let me explain. Many of the things PMI teaches are a bit silly and don't really apply to real life situations. There are some out there that just take what PMI says as the complete truth without questioning anything or seeing how the teachings relate to the workplace. These are people I call ""PMI Junkies"".So my advice... get the book, get certified, learn what you can and make sure you use some common sense."
1,No longer a guide,"The first PMBOK was issued free and purported to be a taxonomy of project management methods and processes. In this regard it was pretty good. However, this latest version of the PMBOK(R) has moved from being a guide covering a wide variety of practices (reflecting the wide variety of projects and management processes) to a narrow one which is apparently required only to pass the PMI's PMP exam. In that regard it is essential as the exam is based on the book.It is not essential and is hardly a ""bible"" for any purpose other than passing the exam and with an absence of footnotes or bibliography it makes a poor guide to the real world of project management. I'm disappointed in the way a useful resource has been converted into something more appropriate for a cult or multi-level marketing association.PMI, bring back a bibliography, bring back alternative points of view, show some evidence about the efficacy of the procedures you have published. It won't hurt, I promise."
3,"Yes, this is the PMBOK","Are you like me? Are you looking for the PMBOK and don't want this fool thing called ""A Guide To The Project Management Body Of Knowledge""?If so, I'll save you some time. They are one and the same. It was the word ""Guide"" that threw me. I didn't want a *GUIDE* to the Project Management Body Of Knowledge, I wanted the actual Project Management Body Of Knowledge book itself. Well.... this is it.Good luck."
2,Not particularly useful.,This book was purchased as a course requirement to go along with the Gray and Larson Project Management text. I do not find this book particularly useful and I do not find that it offers any information that is different from what is inside of the Project Management text.If you are in need of an actual guide to the PM text you might just be out of luck.
5,Project Management Body of Knowlege,"Good book. Very well put together, tracks well from topic to topic, easy to follow.It also happens to be the book that the Project Management Insitute recomends. As a result, all the variables and acronyms match up with what is found in Microsoft Project.All in all, a good book for a class or a reference for work, but not something for light reading."
4,"A Guide to the PMBOK, Third Edition",Delivered faster than originally suggested even though it was the holidays
1,Non-receipt of product,"It's been almost a month and I have received this book. After two weeks, I looked online and reviewed the review of the sender. Too my surprise, I found out that the sender has a practice of not sending the product to buyers. I recommend this seller be taken off of Amazon."
3,A guide to the Project Management Boidy of Knowlege,"The book is fine, written in but that doesn't bother me as much as the CD was not included in the book. The previous person kept the CD which is making me go out and find the software required for the book."
4,Review,Read this book and if you can concentrate well you dont have to read any other book to pass PMP.
4,PMI-PMBOK,"It's a great book for all who intend to acquire knowledge in Project Management. It gives knowledge of widly used & practiced management theories, concepts & formulae etc. It's very helpful and probably the key book for getting PMP certification."
1,A Guide to the Project Mgmt Body of Knowledge-3rd Ed,"The book is good in context but I when I got to the center of the book, it split in half. Now the first half of the book falls out of the binder. I'm going to have to remove all the pages, punch holes and put them in a binder. This is a Guide that I will use and reuse frequently. I'm disappointed that it did not hold up better. I haven't even finished the class yet and I didn't abuse the book, just opened it to read and highlight certain sections.Would you consider replacing the book?"
3,Fast Delivery,The Item has a comparatively faster and timly delivery.books looks good.I am inspired by the amazon deals and saved about 10 $ and i will continue to purchase more from the site
5,PMBOK,"This is necessary today for a project management professional. However, one should note that if one signs up to be a member of PMI, they provide a softcopy on a disk for joining."
3,A useful reference book,The content is well organized to clear illustrate the structure of PMBOK but it lacks of practical examples and samples to let readers grab the real idea.It should be a good reference material when we study PMBOK framework.
3,Text Book,"This is the primary book they used in my 1 week Project Management course. Dry, boring, and is basically a text book, but you need the information to pass the test."
2,Difficult and incomprehensible,"I was required to purchase this book as a part of a class for my master's degree. While I am not a project manager nor do I have a desire to become one, this was a required course. After reading this book over and over again, I realized that I was getting very little useful information out of it. The book does have a good amount of knowledge to transfer, but it is extremely difficult to read. The index is horrible to be point of being nearly useless."
3,A book that I don't need but have to have it.,A book I have to have for PMI certification. Is it worth it? Not really.
4,"Decent shave, great price!","Just bought this to replace a 15+ year old Braun, and it is definitely a great value for the money...it definitely has a different feel than my old Braun (much lighter for sure), but I have to say the difference in the shave is minimal, if any...I typically blade shave during the week, and use an electric on the weekends for convenience, but this may become my standard if the performance stays the same as it has so far..."
1,false advertisment,well the product i received was the norelco 7110 but i did not ghet the extra blades or pouch that was suppose to go with it i complained to amazon but they have done nothing about it but they did change the misleading ad in fact that pretty much was admitting there error
3,Reasonably priced cordless shaver.,"Philips Norelco 7110X shaver is a good product, a good value, and gives a good shave. Its transformer will work with most voltages, a useful feature for overseas travel. However, it doesn't hold a charge as long as I would like. This may be due to the ""rinse clean"" feature. The razor I was ""used to"" was bought in Australia two years ago and seems similar to the Philips Norelco 7145XL Rechargeable Cordless Razor with the transformer internal to the razor."
2,Not Bad Not Good,"I had a Norelco electric shaver that lasted at least 15 years. Finally gave out from use. This one my not last near that long, I'm not that thrilled. I still get a good shave."
3,you get what you pay for,"This shaver is definitely worth what I paid for it . but it does seem a little lacking in power , but shaves decently"
2,disappointing,"I have used Norelco shavers my entire adult life (nearly 30 years). This is the worst one I have purchased. I have used this one for about 6 months. The blades are different than previous models, because they scratch the sides of my chin if I'm not careful. They also take a couple passes to give a good shave.The package and manual state that the charge light blinks when the cycle is complete, and that takes 8 hours. A tech support agent told me that it does blink, but only for a few seconds, then continues to glow. Useless feature.The full charge only lasts a few (3, maybe 4) days. The previous model I had performed much better and charged in about an hour and the charge lasted for a week."
1,Norelco no longer makes decent shavers,"I chose this shaver because it had mostly good reviews, but I think only people with peach fuzz whiskers are going to get a good shave from this. On the first shave after fully charging, it took 8 minutes to get a ""complete"" shave and I ended up cutting my neck also. The only other time I have cut myself with an electric shaver is when the blades were very old and dull. This should not happen with a brand new shaver. I took it back the next day and got a Remington R-800 instead. Unfortunately, the Remington is not as good as my old Norelco 7616X, but it's a darn site better than this Norelco."
2,Disappointed,"I have gotten this shaver as a replacement for an old Hitachi. What a disappointment. The shaver's battery is terrible. I barely get 3 or 4 shaves out of it. Also, I don't use this shaver every day, so it could be the idle time drains the battery too. Also, you can't just plug it in, and start using the shaver. Power can only come from the battery, so you can't bypass it (a real bummer when the shaver is low on juice). Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the ergonomics to be too bad. The other problem is that it takes a while to shave as well, it's slow. I got fed up, and got a Panasonic instead (and it was only forty bucks). MUCH MUCH better. I charged it once, and it's still going strong. Save your money and get a better product."
2,It does not give uniform shave,"Its hard to get a uniform shave with this. Also even after 3 months, my skin still burns whenever I shave. I switched back to my razor"
4,Does it's job,"Good shaver but I found out that I prefer a blade. Only negative is that I don't like the battery, you have to charge it for 8 hours at a time and can't leave it plugged in all the time. Other then that it does a very nice job."
3,good deal,"bought cheaply when on sale for $25. i have always been a fan of norelco razors because they work great and are fast to use. quality has gone down over the years since philips bought them out. the plastic on this one is cheap when put side by side with my older norelco made in holland.I used to have an lcd display for power which this one doesnt have, just a green and red light for power. there is no travel bag like previous norelco models.cleaning is very easy though with just a quick wash in hot water. but i have concerns of constant water exposure to the blades which probably causes rust over time.also cutting power doesnt seem as strong as older models and requires you to go back and fourth a few more times."
3,"average quality, not as good as i expected","I bought this directly from Amazon about a week ago for a blowout price. It already looks like Amazon is not selling this item anymore as it is currently only listed as available from various Marketplace sellers.For the three ten-spots I paid, I'm satisfied. It basically cost what replacement blades for my other shaver cost. I will say that this shaver doesn't appear to have the same quality of build as my last Norelco. It is lighter, doesn't feel as good in the hand, and has a cheap plastic feel. The motor sounds like it's less powerful than my older model (which listed for a similar full retail price when new); even with a full charge it doesn't sound like the blades and spinning around very fast. That being said, the thing isn't particularly quiet either.Gives an adequate if mediocre shave. Requires lots of passes over the same area of skin in order to get everything. All in all not a terrible buy, but not a great find either."
3,"Works, but instruction manual error","This is my third Norelco. After receiving, the charging-complete light did not indicate that charging was done. So I called Norelco tech support. (their website was useless) Finally, a knowledgable rep said, ""Sorry, the manual is wrong. Your model does not have the 'charging complete' feature."" So the user must time charging, and remove the charger after 8 hours. Annoying.But it shaves great."
2,Not a good buy,I got it as a birthday present.This is not a good product.1. The charge stays for barely 2 weeks.2. You don't know when it is fully charged.3. It has an external charger.4. It used to gradually stop towards the end of battery charge. Recently it has started to just cut off suddenly when the charge is low. Not even a 'whirr' sound...Hope this helps --
3,Returned for exchange,"Mine didn't hold a charge and I returned it for exchange. But, while I had it, it ran quitely and shaved closely. I sent it back just yesterday and don't know when the replacement will arrive."
3,Norelco 7110 Cordless Rechargeable Shaver,"New item, fast shipper, but returned item due to it does not give as close a shave as it should."
4,Norelco 7110X,"This razor does a much better job than the previous Norelco ( Reflex Plus 6613X ) did, and the cutting heads do not clog up with clippings after just a few shaves as the 6613X would. Also it is easy to clean, cost less, and has a low battery indicator light which allows you to get an indication of how much time you have left to shave before having to recharge. I would definitely recommend it. Excellent product for the price."
2,"Poor shave, low battery life","This is my second Norelco shaver. The first was purchased for about the same price about 12 years ago and worked well for its lifetime (it still works, but not well). The new Norelco 7110 is a big step down from that old model. It takes me a long time to shave (which means I mostly go around looking unshaven), requiring many passes over the same area, and the battery charge does not last more than one shave. By the time I've cleaned my face, the red ""low"" battery indicator is blinking. Also, and this is probably the worst change with respect to the older model, when the shaver is plugged in, it still runs off battery, meaning that if the battery is dead you can't shave for an hour even if it's plugged in! So a year after buying it, I'm in the market for a new shaver."
3,Norelco Shaver,It is well made but when fully charged it only lasts two shaves and then needs to be charged again.
4,good choice,This shaver works very well once you get used to the switch from razors. The only minor complaint is the rather limited charge it holds. I usually get 3-4 shaves out of it.
4,Philips Norelco 7110X Cordless - its just OKAY,"This is my first time using a electronic shaver. 7110 is well priced(I paid less than 35$).Still cannot get a clean shave like a Gilette, But I like the fact that we can clean it under the tap with hot water.... Trimmer works good ....Like the grip...But I still prefer a clean Razor shave.."
5,My first electric shaver!,"This is my first electric shaver (have been using gillette sensor excel for number of years) and I love it. This is giving me a very close shave on my cheeks but not so close under the chin/neck area. Still, I am very happy with the overall shave and definitely recommend this to others."
2,inexpensive,it's ok barely passable I was looking for cheap and got what I paid for. Have owned other Norelco razors and have always been satisfied. would probably spend a little more money and get the next model it's not a bad product i just got what I payed for
3,"It's worth $40 paid for it, but I wouldn't buy it again","I've had this shaver for over a year. No complaints about shaving - doesn't take too long; it's washable also, but horrible on two places - my neck and my lower lip area. This is the only shaver that managed to give me razor bumps on my neck and CUT my chin. When I shave in between my chin and my lower lip, it just goes ""snap"" and cuts my skin.It takes a bit longer to get a decent clean shave out of it than other shavers, but overall it's worth $40 paid for it.However, if choosing again, I'd get something like HQ8xxx (three circles on each blade) since I actually put in HQ9 blades into HQ7110 and it seemed to shave a lot faster.Bottom line: don't buy it, add another $50 and get HQ8140 or RQ1050, it's worth it :)"
4,"Philips Norelco 7110X Cordless, Rechargeable Shaving System","This shaver has performed well for me, so far. I was able to shave five days, before recharging. The charger is built into the cord, making the shaver itself lighter. However the cord is not compatible with my older Morelco shaver. It provides a very good shave for me."
1,works great ONLY for 3 weeks,"Well, I bought it to replace a Remington shaver which I had for 18 months and was leaving red marks on my neck (it needed new blades which were almost same price as a new shaver).Anyway, I got a ""Philips Norelco 7110X"" and it worked great and quite for first 3 weeks then started to be not so comfortable and today after only one month it shaves as bad as my older shaver was doing after one year!! This is my 3rd experience with Philips, and excuse my language but ""IT SUCKS"" period."
2,Ain't what it used to be!,"Philips sure cheapend up a good product. I had my previous Norelco for 25 years and it finally gave out. This ""new"" model weighs half as much,and is so cheaply made I do not expect it to last 5 years. Does not give as good a shave as my old one did after 25 years."
2,Sub-adequate shaver.,The power of this shaver is terrible. Requires multiple passovers and often pricks a few hairs in the process. Battery life is not very good as well. Avoid shaver.The only reason I am giving it two stars is because the price is close to what you would expect for replacement heads. Which is exactly what I ended up doing after one week. I took out the heads and placed it in my 4 year old shaver and its been great!
4,nice shaver,"i've used one that worked a little better, but this is a great shaver, escpecially for the price, i love it, easy to use, easy to clean, charges quickly and holds a charge for long period of time"
2,You get what you pay for (even in a razor),"If you like plugging in your shaver constantly, this is the device for you. I purchased this a little while ago and have been using it for about 2 months. It looks nice, but really only lasts about 10-15 min of shaving before you get the red flashing ""charge me"" indicator. Even when it is fully charged, it doesn't seem that powerful. I find myself going over an area over and over again and then just getting a regular razor to get the job done.Pros:Easy to turn on and off, simply press a button.Looks good and when it works, it does a decent job.Cons:Lasts only 10-15 min max before you have to plug it in overnight to charge.Does do as good of job as I thought it would actually shaving.Recommendation:Save you money and buy a better shaver. If if you can't afford something nicer, a bag of disposable razors will do a better job."
1,Worst Norelco (I've owned) in 30 years,I've been using Norelcos since I started shaving and this is by far the worst one I've ever owned. My first two lasted the first 20 years and over the last 10 years I've probably had 3 or 4. Quality definitely going downhill. It seems that long-term users in general are fed up with the latest Norelcos and haven't decide what to replace it with yet. I'll be sure to return the next one quickly if I'm not happy.
2,Recharging-8-full charge for up to 25 minutes of shave time,"Hi Amazon: I am very unhappy with Philips Norelco shaver, model 7110X, that I received on 3/23/07. After charging the battery, before first use, for the required 8 hours, and an 8 hour recharging every second/third day since then, I cannot get a shave for up to the indicated 25 minutes of shave time. The ""low"" battery indicator ALWAYS comes on the second or third time I shave. I am going to keep trying but I think the total shave time is certainly less than the 25 minutes indicated."
1,Battery doesn't keep charge,"I am very disappointed with my new Philips Norelco 7110x. Its battery is too small and requires frequent charging. According to Philips customer service, the battery can hold a maximum charge of 25 minutes. If it takes 5 minutes to shave....a person would need to recharge every 5 days. This is way too frequent and a hassle. My older Philips shaver required recharging every 3-4 weeks! NOT every 5 days. I'm very very disappointed with this product."
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this to replace a Norelco shaver I had for over 5 years. Instead of buying new blades, I decided the 'new' shave system might be worth the difference. I went from a good shaver that lasts 4-5 months per charge to a good shaver that lasts a week to 10 days per charge. It did shave any better than the old one I had.I don't know yet if this is indicative of all new Norelco shavers or just this model, but I would have returned it if I could have. I would not recommend this model."
1,Sucks,"I bought this product because I was only able to wet shave once a week without getting a lot of bleeding or irritation. This product did not change anything. All it does is leave my skin red, causes minor cuts and does not do anything in the neck area."
5,excellent product,it is an excellent product for the price I paid. I strongly recommend the Philips Norelco 7110X!!!
2,Too irritating,"I bought this shaver in july/august for around $40 in WalMart, and at first it was OK (by far not as close as a Gillete M3 Power or Fusion), but right now it irritates my skin really bad! Shaving the neck is a hassle, and you must pass it over it many times. I would not recommend it."
3,Not bad,Just not as good as the similar Remington it replaced. The only thing I like better with the Norelco is that it's quieter than the Remington.
4,Works fine,"Works as intended, and the motor is pretty quiet. I haven't felt the difference with the Lift-n-Cut feature that it advertises so much, I don't feel any significant difference when compared to other electric shavers. But the instruction says that 8-hour of charge can only yield 25 minutes of operating time, that's a bit short to me. Maybe because it's the lower priced model, and the more expensive ones will have longer battery time? On the other hand, it's pretty easy to clean the shaving head, just one press n the head pops out, just rinse it with water and you are pretty much done, or you can clean the inside with the supplied brush. Overall, so far so good."
4,good razor & price,"I bought this razor two months ago to replace a 20 year old Norelco Rota-Tract. It's quieter, shaves closer & it's lighter than the old one. The light does not tell you when it's fully charged as the owners manual says it should. I just leave it charging over night when the low charge light flashes & it's fine. It seems to hold a charge for a long time. I wish it had a nice case like my old one. Overall I like it. If it lasts like the old one I had it will be a great razor!"
1,No such model?,"I spoke to Norelco on what this model might be and they stated emphatically, that there is no such model as the 7110XL. Strange."
4,Reasonable shaver,I needed a quick shaver.It is adequate.Shaves reasonably well but after 3 shaves the charge light starts to flash.Eventually I will buy a better model of the same shaver
3,Norelco 7110X,"A good shave, but the batteries go dead quickly. My old Norelco lasts more than a week between charges, this lasts two or three days."
2,Mediocre at best,"I've owned other Norelco shavers and this one might be my last; The cons outweigh the pros. Given the price, I expect a better performer. I'm searching for a new razor instead of buying replacement blades.Pros:1. Lightweight (see con #1)2. Rinsable bladesCons1. Wall wort makes it cumbersome to travel with, and you'll have to because...2. Battery life seems much shorter than advertised, which is a problem because...3. The shave isn't very close so you'll spend more time shaving.Your morning routine deserves better."
2,"For good performance, look elsewhere...","After 10 years, my trusty old Norelco died. Thinking all electric razors were the same, I replaced it with the cheapest model in the store- I've learned my lesson. Positives: holds a charge, eventually gives you a close shave, and easy to clean. Negative (dealbreaker for me): it consistently takes at least 3 to 5 passes (if not more) to get most of the hairs, and even then, there are usually some stragglers. My old razor spoiled me- it generally took only one pass. With the 7110x, you can go over a giant hair over and over, and it'll miss it every time and then randomly catch it on the 5th pass. If you're on a tight budget & can get a good deal on it, and if you don't get frustrated by spending a lot of time shaving the same areas over and over, then this will work for you. Personally, I now realize that all razors are not created equal, and I'll soon be replacing this with a more expensive model that doesn't take 10 minutes per shave."
4,"Excellent Value, Convenient for Travel","I've had this razor for quite a few years.Bought it on a fantastic sale- was even a bit leary because of the price I paid back then.Excellent shave. Charge lasts me 9 to 10 days. Red LED flash during shave when it's time to plug in -but you can finish the shave. (In fact, I've gotten add'l shaves from it on those occasions where I'd forgotten to plug it in.)Only drawback is, unlike my previous rechargeable shaver, it cannot be used as a corded shaver. So if the battery is dead, you'll have to wait for it to fully charge. -Probably that afternoon.But it's never been a problem because, as mentioned, you can get a shave or two after the first signal."
2,Bogus Battery?,"I was looking forward to this razor, in part due to the rave reviews on Amazon. I must have gotten a rotten apple because I only get maybe, at the most, 5 minutes of shave time before the red light comes on. I charge the battery for much longer than the stated 8 hours and it still won't hold the charge for long. Just tried Norelco's online ""live"" customer support to find out how to return for service/replacement and the agents are 1) not very knowledgeable, and 2) unable to stay connected with me for more than a couple minutes. So far, a waste of 25 bucks, but at least it was only 25 bucks."
2,Comprop,"This item is well made and fits a Honda 50 well. The pitch and size are all wrong for this motor. At top speed it red lines the engine and does not reach a reasonablespeed.I keep it for and emergency prop, but will not buy another unless they revise the pitch and size."
3,Eileen,Good scent but a little too thick. I usually use the shea butter one from the same company and it is great and not too thick.
1,Hard as Rocks,"I used to love these things when i was a kid, and i had a craving for them again, and i bought em, i should have read the reviews, man these things are as hard as rocks! BEWARE people do not buy these things from online, go to your store and order em or buy em fresh! UGH the only way to eat them is to suck on em for a long time and then they SLOWLY dissolve. bleh who the heck wants that?"
2,"NOT for ""tractor"" mowers","I have a John Deer STX38 ride-on tractor mower, and given that this book has a John Deere mower on the cover, I figured it would cover mine. Unfortunately, there are only a few models of John Deere mowers covered. Keep in mind that a mower is NOT a tractor. If your mower looks more like a tractor (see the book ""Yard and Garden Tractor Service Manual"" for an example on the cover), then that is probably the book you want instead.Most of this book covers a scattered list of ""ride-on"" lawn mowers (really, lawn mowers you can sit on that really aren't equipped to do anything else, such as tow, haul, etc...) - and there is only 1/3 of the book that discusses engines, etc. Most of the content is very specific to specific models and if yours isn't in the list, then it's quite useless of a book."
4,Great for Toddlers,"This is great for toddlers and very educational. It also, keeps your little one busy."
1,research versus propaganda,"People reading this book should be aware that recent researchhas shown that there is NO LINK between abortion and breast cancerrisk. As published in the New England Journal of Medicine (Jan 9,1997), Melbye and coworkers studied the health records of 1.5 millionDanish women over enough time to include 28.5 million person-years andconcluded ""Induced abortions have no overall effect on the riskof breast cancer."" They found a relative risk of 1.00, whichmeans that women who have induced abortions have exactly the same riskof breast cancer as those who do not have them. People oftencriticize studies because of a small sample size. In this case, theresearchers studied the amazing number of 1.5 million women, which isquite easy in a country with socialized medicine and detailed medicalrecords. Those who wish to scare women away from reproductive choicesimply do not have science on their side on this one. They need tofind another gimick..."
4,Refreshing,"A refreshing read. Fun. I can't wait to read the sequel! There is so much more to learn about Crystal Pines and it's owners, Edward and Olivia, not to mention the rest of the cast of characters.Keep writing!!"
4,Lovely,"I really liked the action in the first chapter - it drew me into the book immediately. I also liked the manners of the characters. I loved the descriptions of the ladies' dresses, the architecture, and the landscape. I hope the author writes at least 3 sequels to let me know how the other 3 cousins' lives work out!"
4,Artemis Foul Files,It is a good book to get pulled into and never want to stop reading. So I would like to give it four and a half stars. The thing I dislike is that I have the book and it does not follow on the same page. I would recommend it to everyone but mostly to my friend Ellie Bates. I think she would like it too.
5,Great fun!,"Ok...I am 53 years old. And I am a huge Artemis Fowl fan!!!!! This book is absolutely delightful, fun and gives insights to the characters we love!"
4,great book,A good read for when your in between books.The book adds more to the story but uses the Artemis Fowl books for support so it is more difficult to understand if you have not read the Artemis Fowl books.
4,Good book,Being a fan of the Artemis Fowl series I enjoyed this. I even spent a ridiculous amount of time discipering the secret messages that were written in code. The stories were interesting and it was fun to read about the characters that I liked again. This maybe made waiting for the next book in the series easier.If you haven't read the Artemis Fowl series than you may enjoy this but I would really recommend reading the other books first.This wasn't a terrific book but will be a good read for any fan of the Artemis Fowl series.
4,"GOOD, BUT GET'S A LITTLE SUPERFICIAL","My opinion about this book is it's a good collecors guide. The two short story's were wonderful and the interviews were enjoyable. Unfortunely, it gets stupid when they say Artemis Fowl's most embarrassing moment is getting a 99 percent on an assignment. Come on, that old run around has been used 101 times.Aside from cheap little moments (luckily, not too many) like above, it was an enjoyable book, especially since everybody is waiting for the 4th book THE OPAL DECEPTION."
3,Can't Remember if I Finished It,"I think my title says it all. I enjoy the Artemis Fowl series, and I'm a 43-year old mother! This book gave some interesting background on particular characters in the series, i.e. how Holly Short came to be Julius Root's favorite LEP. I've never tried to decipher Colfer's codes and this book gives the code away. It has lots of short pieces. I read this book whenever I had nothing else to read."
4,"Good book, but not in good condition.","Very good book. However, when I recived my copy, the spine was pulling way from the outside spine. Other than that, good read."
4,more than a rehash,"This is an excellent supplement to those Mud People who are fascinated by the Faery folk. Unlike a lot of tie in books, this is not written by publisher's staffers to squeeze a few more shekels from the consumer.This is a stand alone work of which provides history of into magick society and insight into the Fowl characters.Definitely worth reading."
4,The Artemis Fowl Files,"I've only read a little bit in a bookstore, but I think The Artemis Fowl Files is a very good book. I recomend it to you. If you are going to buy it, you should buy it on Amazon."
2,The Title Simply Lies,"This book is actually a collection of cheap, overworked ""fact-files"" put together with two cheesy, short stories. I would advise going to the bookestore, taking a minute to read the stories, then re-shelving the book. This is not a guide, or an informative or entertaining read."
1,ridiculous!,"this is just incredibly stupid! i love artemis fowl but this buy was extremely terrible. i bought the artemis fowl files to get the gnommish decoder, but i looked and there is no decoder at all! i will be sure to get another copy hopefully that actually HAS the decoder."
5,Great Active Learning Techniques for the classroom!,"A wonderful collection of discussion games and other active learning strategies that engage students' imaginations. As a first year teacher, this is a perfect resource of non-lecture instructional strategies. Each activity can be easily xeroxed for students. Degen has already prepared detailed instructions for small group presentations and projects. The detailed instructions for a court trial are superb! His other classroom management handouts are especially helpful to new teachers--class guidelines, parent conference handouts, etc. I wish I had this resource for student teaching."
1,Disgusting.. get out of humanity's way of betterment. you and the likes of you.,"-there is no post-human. Current state of humanity, defines human now. and in the future: what humanity ""improves to be""(yes, that's what its called) will define ""human"".-""improved"" doesn't mean ""god""-""human dignity"" isn't explained clearly... but he clearly doesn't mean what i understand from it.-""human nature"" .... see the ""blank page"" argument.-is this guy a time traveler from the dark ages? i just.. i can't understand this illogical, unfounded opposition without any solid bases.-this book is written out of irrational fear.-the author can't point a SINGLE solid argument as to why bio-technological revolution will be bad, apart from illogical neo-luddite rantings.-it's all about ""ooh we're gonna loose everything that makes us human""... hmm so what? if it's for becoming better than the ""human"" you describe? and what we become will still be called human. sorry to dissappoint you... not!"
4,An entertaining and informative tour,"Outside of London and, of course, Liverpool, New York City has more sites associated with The Beatles than any other city. John Lennon spent most of the last decade of his life in NYC so there are also plenty of sites associated with Lennon's post-Beatles life and they're virtually all here on this DVD. Trina Yannicos and Susan Ryan take us on an entertaining and informative tour of the Big Apple's Lennon sites. A must for any non-New Yorker Lennonphiles thinking of making the trip to NYC and handy for New York-based fans as well."
4,Informative and Entertaining,"If you enjoy a thorough and lively tour through the haunts of the places John used to hang out and the people he knew. Check this DVD out. I was entertained by the touring of Susan and Trina. They truly have amassed a great deal of knowledge making this DVD a great educational tool for the fan wanting to learn it all about John when he lived in NYC. Some places, liek LaFortuna are disappearing and this is a wonderful tribute to these places.I found out a few things I didn't know and I know quite a bit about John and his life. I'm a Beatles Historian and used to work at the Hard Rock Vault as their expert on The Beatles. Pick up this delightful and thorough DVD and spend an afternoon getting lost in the memories with Trina, Susan and their guests."
1,My discs wont play,"Short and simple - my discs dont play on any of my 4 DVD players. Yep, I'm right here in Maryland so its not me."
5,What You Need To Know,"Originally released in 1957, this fondly remembered Gene Autry Christmas album features ""America's Favorite Singing Cowboy"" performing 12 classic Christmas songs, including ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" ""Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane),"" and ""Jingle Bells."" This album has been unavailable for over 20 years, and due to fan demand and the nostalgic value of the original LP, it is now issued on CD for the first time ever. Gene's spoken introductions interject interesting stories about the songs to make this unique Christmas album a very personal listening experience. Includes songs not on any other Gene Autry Christmas CD. All tracks are digitally re-mastered from the original tapes, and it features the original album art."
4,Gene Autry's Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer,"My parents had this Christmas album when I was little, and I was so happy to find it on CD! It brought back wonderful memories of sitting by the hi-fi with my younger brothers and sister, wondering how many days were left until Christmas and Santa Claus. My three young daughters LOVED singing along to ""Here Comes Santa Claus,"" and ""Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer"" this year. If you like old-fashioned Christmas music, or have small children, you'll love this CD."
5,I Love This C.D.,LISTENING TO THIS C.D. MAKES ME THINK OF MY CHILDHOOD SPENDING CHRISTMAS WITH MY GRANDPARENTS. OF WHICH WHOM HAVE PAST I EVEN GOT MY SISTER ONE SHE ALSO LOVES IT. SO SIT BACK LISTEN AND REMEMBER. MERYY CHRISTMAS
2,Very disappointed,"I ordered this CD because it was an album I enjoyed as a child. I specifically ordered it for the songs 32 Feet and 8 Little Tails, The Nativity Story and Buon Natale. All these songs were cut from this CD. Only 9 of the 12 tracks on this CD are from the original album. I have no idea who the last 3 tracks even are, they certainly don't sound like Gene Autry!"
2,I don't even know where to begin...,"As a Gene Autry fan, particularly of his Christmas recordings, I was really looking forward to this release. But...what a disappointment! I will look over the dropouts - obviously the source tapes have deteriorated - but what happened to the final three cuts? They are so laden with noise reduction artifacts that they are barely listenable. And, I know the disc is short, but were the 2 second pauses between tracks REALLY necessary? Talk about choppy. No flow at all.This CD did make me do one thing...go back into my archives and pull out my original Grand Prix vinyl. I think I'll be doing a transfer and retire this CD to the bottom shelf."
4,Just as expected,"Having known what to expect with this CD, it did not disappoint. If you want to hear the original, old timey Gene Autry Christmas music, this CD is it."
5,Classic Gene Autry,"Bought this CD for my dad, who loved it. Now three generations of our family are enjoying Gene Autry Christmas Classics."
5,Powerful stuff,"This is like no other album in John Cale's discography. It's also one of those discs where you're absolutely stumped for a comparison to anyone else. It's stark and miserable and powerful and vague, sometimes all at once. The only constant is Cale's dramatic singing and the spare lyrics to each song which somehow seem to connect emotionally even when they don't say much. John Cale has made good albums, awful albums and great albums. This is a great album."
3,Difficult to Digest,"Cale is always at least interesting (if not always enjoyable) and there are some wonderful moments here, but too much of this record is given over to ""songs"" that are little more than poetry recitations over background noise. You should adjust my rating up or down one star depending on your appreciation of such extreme avant-garde-isms.If you are a fan, this is definitely worth owning for ""Taking Your Life In Your Hands"", ""Chinese Envoy"", and a stunning rendition of ""I Keep A Close Watch"" (far superior to the version on ""Helen Of Troy""). Also of interest is his wife Rise's reading of ""Rise, Sam and Rimsky-Korsakov"". If you are new to Cale, this may not be the best place to start. Most of his music is much more accessible than this..."
5,Buy Far one of...If Not His Best. Cale's Equivelant 2 Lou's Berlin,"This is by far Cale's most imaginitve rock album full of very sentimental and emotional tracks. It is expensive on CD, but I bought it on Cd and I even own already on Cassette and Vinyl. If you like John Cale just a little bit you will still be blown away buy his originality on this album. By far one of his best top 3. Next to Paris and Vintage Violence and Church of Anthrax."
4,Here's my take,"I like this recording a lot. I personally enjoy the fact that you can tell that the recording technology is not that good, it kind of adds to the ambience of the pieces. While I do not feel that technically (as an ensemble) this is the best performance I have ever heard, there is certianly a genuine nature to it. There is a lack of depth to the ensemble, again due to the recording, but to be honest I don't mind too much. The Pines of Rome is a little faster than I would like it but overall a solid recording."
3,"""special"" ??? edition ???","Aside from the audio commentary, by Welch and Director Sarne, there is nothing new to see. No deleated scenes, no additional scenes, there are 4 previews, and a AMC backstory on the making of, which is somewhat interesting. For a film that was almost a notorious for what wound up on the cutting room floor, as what it contained, this ""special edition"" is a big letdown.The best thing I can say, is that the picture quality is great, and the sound is good. Maybe someday, there will be a ""restored""edition."
3,Worked as an usher!,"We had a line a block long @ the 1:30pm show,all senoirs! When the show ended the patrons were very angry, they said Hollywood should be burned down.After that show I would hide when the filmended.I was sixteen,It took me years to understand what was going on on screen.I am a big Mae West fan. This was in Balto.Md."
3,MYRA BRECKINRIDGE,AN EXTREMELY STRANGE MOVIE AND MY GOD MAE WEST TRYING TO ACT SEXY IN HER 80'S. DON'T BLINK OR YOU MIGHT MISS TOM SELLICK.
3,"Not a ""cult classic"", but almost...","It's amazing that a studio backed this mess of a story/film and released it, thinking that it would be a hit among anyone. This premise is just too out there for the average, ""make me feel better and affirm my own biases"" film-goer. With that said, because it's sooooooooo over the top and messy, it's quite wonderful. Mae West gets off some great one-liners, and my god, any film that can feature Mae West surrounded by dancing black men as she's rapping (YES, I said 80yr old Mae West RAPPING!!!)truly is something wonderful! Oh, and miss Welch has maybe the second best bed-hair in cinema (#1 is Miss Deneuve in Belle Du Jour, tres parfait bien sur!). Myra Brekinridge isn't for everyone, but approached with the right spirit, you'll love it!"
2,big question mark,I have no idea of what the story is about. The main reason that I purchased the title was for Raquel Welch but this is a bomb of a picture
3,Mae West was never really a sex symbol,She was a comedienne who mocked sex. She was the only thing worth watching in this confusing movie.
2,Pretty dull despite some good acting!,"I usually love these kind of movies but this one was a letdown. Nowhere near as good or campy as Beyond the valley of the dolls or other schlock movies like Death Race 2000 etc. Welch is great and sexy and Mae west has some classic lines- its occasionally funny but disjointed and grows tiresome. I bought this and after one viewing and will most likely resell. Not as notorious as the bio makes you believe- it doesnt even fall into the"" so bad its good"" category. See it once and judge yourself before buying."
2,Take that Moral values!!,"Based on Gore Vidal's gender bending novel of the same name, Myra Breckinridge is out to ""re-align the sexes"" in this hilariously awful cult favorite. One of Hollywood's greatest disasterpieces, it was the ideal movie for the gay audience, back when studios didn't realize there was one. A cinematic punch to the gut of our current obsession with moral values."
3,Myra Breckinridge,"Kind of quirky, but in all a nice movie, great cast Mae West,a young Tom Selleck and Farrah Fawcett,Raquel Welch it's not the greatest of movies made but it kind of pokes fun at the subject of transgender. I like it. No harm intended in the movie it'just for fun. Mae West and Raquel Welch are both stunning as always."
3,Heavenly Farrah,"Myra Breckinridge is a strange movie. When Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett are on the screen, is great. The hot Welch's seduction on an inocent Farrah is very sexy and luxurious. Welch's scene with the Farrah's stud is different and good too, besides the two most wanted sex symbols of the seventies on the same movie is something to remember. But what is it Mae West?! Ok, she was funny at the past, but her scenes (specially the songs) are out of the order.Besides that, Myra is an interesting movie. The visual is very rich, and we can get a lot of ideas watching this.André Sancovsky, Rio de Janeiro"
2,"movie; 2 stars, this package, 2 and a half.","Any die hard fan of Raquel will want this for her commentary track, which is very telling. But if you've seen this flop as many times as I have, it's really the only reason to buy this."
2,Much ado about nothing,It is not often that a book comes along that a reader has personal knowledge about. In this case Ms. Kennedy has written a book of interesting self interest and little depth. Their is allot of outrage expressed but very little factual data to support the outrage. I agree with Ms. Kennedy on most of the issues but I only wish that she had documented her charges more completly. A missed opportunity. More smoke than fire. Guilty but not proven. Too bad.
2,"Quick read, but poorly written","The book's title promises ""i-mode strategy"" but fails to deliver anything but a strangely low-level account covering some of the difficulties encountered in the initial development and launch of i-mode. The book feels like it's been scrubbed clean of interesting anecdotes by a corporate PR department. It's also written by an author who remains annoyingly proud of her luddite status, so there's very little in the way of real tech strategy to be gleaned from it."
2,Not a STAR product,"I was eager to wait for this book initially, thought the book would given same information as what I had read on Nokia. The book is I-Mode strategy and I think not much strategy were discussed by the author.I think Natsuno-san, is not ""open"" enough to discuss about I-Mode strategy.The writings are basic about I-Mode and what the progress. This is not a worth purchase. I think the readers would more interested about how they build I-Mode at the beginning (not technical way) like the branding strategy, policy and etc. There is a lot of issue had not been discuss in the book."
4,Believable angst,"As the designated family book reviewer, I encouraged my husband and teenaged son to read this book after I finished it. The character of Austin is likable and evokes empathy in the reader, even when he does things he doesn't understand himself. While Heather at first seems to be the stereotypical spoiled princess, she reveals deeper levels of her character as the story progresses. This is a book that should definitely leave teen readers with a feeling of hope."
4,Good hits not greatest of the 80's,Several great 80's songs some same as many other era CDs some I didn't remember over all a good deal and fun to listen too.
5,Just what I wanted.,"Im happy with this watch so far. In my type of work I always need a durable watch. I used to be a big timex watch fan, but the last two timex watches I bought were poorly made. My father bought me a timex when I was 15 and the watch was great. I had to replace the straps twice before the watch became obsolete. Then I decided to buy another timex. hence my comment on the last two timex watches I bought. So far this watch is great. The display is huge and is also easily seen at night. The alarm is loud and the controls are easy."
1,it just didnt work,"i had some problems with this order, the bill didn't arrive with the watch to the p.o. box and it couldn't be sent to my country as it was supossed to, when i finally recieved this watch (after sending several emails to solve the situation) it just didn't work, i had to spent money to fix it."
5,Most Excellent Indeed,"I saw this movie in the theaters when it was making its US tour. It was really really awesome. It wasn't just about b-boying but also about the guys and their stories. But of course, the dancing is insanity and a must-watch.Oh... the American crew in the movie (Knucklehead Zoo) has some members that are also in Super Crew- winners of MTV's America's Best Dance Crew Season 2."
4,Awesome movie.,So inspiring! I can watch Japan a million times and never get tired of them. A really great movie that shows so much heart and determination of these crews. An inspiration for dancers.
4,The History of BBoy,"This DVD is amazing. I'm a HUGE Bboy fan. It's about the International Bboy championships! Teams from all over the world. It's more than just dance shots, you learn what all the kids go through with families and respective countries to live the BBOY life! Before there was ABDC, there was Planet BBOY."
3,"Interesting, Information but negative.","I read this book with the hope of gaining an insight into how being an ""only"" would affect my daughter. This was the wrong book to buy. It was very negative and the subjects blamed everything that went wrong in their lives on being an only child. It is well written and obviously well researched but I would rather have seen a more balanced approach which highlighted as much of the good as it did the bad"
3,The Only Child How to survive being one,Found this interesting but missing the shadow side i.e. the self centredness and self absorption of the only child. Found it gave them further support in being the way they were and not supporting them with explicit changes.
4,Excellent illustrations (true DK quality); Large format,"The quality of the book is in keeping with other DK publications (the eyewitness guides, etc.). The book is large format and provides an engaging visual reference for kids (and their parents alike).Parents should keep in mind the following(a) This is a regular book, i.e. not made exceptionally sturdy for children (it is not a ""board"" book), so pages can be easily torn-up or wrinkled (made even easier by the large format of the pages)(b) Most of the trucks shown in the book are unique (e.g. long trailers, racing trucks, etc.), instead of the more everyday varieties that one sees on the street.Otherwise, my 2-year old son loves the book!"
4,Can really help bring in objects closer in a pinch,"I purchased my B+W 5X filter before I owned a macro lens. It can bring in those small flowers and insects if used with a zoom lens not designed for macro work. It allows you to focus within inches of your subject.The drawbacks to this filter are that you cannot focus at all on subjects farther away than a few inches,so it must be removed if you shoot a far away subject when the perfect shot arises while you are doing macro work,which for the serious photographer can occur quite often.Can be inconvenient.I do alot of garden /flower photography so I found it necessary to get a macro lens myself.It will still come in handy when on a photoshoot using wide angle zoom and an odd macro shot presents itself.This is the perfect solution for someone who only occasionally does macro work adn doesn't wish to invest in a more expensive macro lens."
4,The early days of the hippest label ever...,"Wow. For anyone who likes novelty music this thing's an absolute gold mine--everything from the all-kazoo version of ""Whole Lotta Love"" to Seth Kirkland's ""Famous Jews"", which was a big hit on Dr. Demento but unreleased for years. In the meantime, Adam Sandler wrote a song that was more or less the same gag, but he had a record deal. Too bad for Seth. The second disc is a little less enjoyable than the first, but they're still very solid efforts and worth their weight in platinum for fans of Big Daddy, or Wildman Fischer, or any of the other stars in the Rhino galaxy. At last, a doo-wop version of the national anthem with CD quality sound!"
5,"Cure for the ""Bland"" problem","The first time I tried this I thought it was awfully bland, and I went by the instructions on the back.Now the 2nd time, I'm putting two packs per can of coconut and a teaspoon and a half of salt. It tastes really good now, spicy and strong.I'm still going to try other brands for a more intense flavor, though."
3,cheaper than takeout,"Buying this and following it's instructions will ensure that you get yellow curry straight out of a restaurant. Its significantly cheaper per portion than a restaurant. However, I would say that it's probably not as good as home made,"
4,Works Great!,It works great! Authentic genuine Canon ink is always best. Don't mess with cheaper imitation/refilled off brand inks.
1,Boring boring boring,"I bought this hoping to find some good, retro synthpop that would be equal to, or better than, the music that I loved in the 80's. It's hugely disappointing, utterly soulless, and mind bogglingly boring. Most of the tracks suffer from the same fate that kills most dance remixes- a mediocre song is stretched from a harmless 3 minutes into a monotonous, repetitive 6 minute bore, with no sense of timimg, structure or joy. Even a bad Depeche Mode or OMD album is more enjoyable than this."
4,Tremendous Sampler,"I love this compilation! It is very nearly a greatest hits album of the great synthpop label A Different Drum. Highlights for me are the songs by Echo Image, Merge, Sweep, System22, and The Echoing Green. As with all compilations there are a few songs of which I'm not that fond, but this is one of the best all around compilations I've ever heard. It is also a great primer on some of the best synthpop released in the last few years. I fully intend to purchase another copy for use as a gift in hopes of a synthpop conversion."
4,Great Price / Great Selection,"Coming from a place where it can be near impossible to get your hands on good synthpop it is fantastic to come across a compilation with so many great bands.Compilations are a great way to see what is out there, and this one is no different. The range of bands and the song selection is fantastic. The tracks are well chosen and the mixes good, this is a great cd for those favourite tracks or even a way to hear some of the bands you have heard so much about but may not of heard.Given the price of standard synth pop cds it is hard to think you could go wrong buying this one."
3,Not what I thought...,I ordered this CD off the strength of the title (because who doesn't love the classic club anthems?) and I was disappointed. While the songs do fit the description I was expecting more songs along the lines of Front 242's Headhunter or maybe even an Echoing Green song. Now I have a CD with mostly mediocre and a couple better-than-average synthpop tracks. It's nice to have but I don't feel it lives up to the hype.
4,Closer than most,"Despite what I see here from this 1 star reviewer this album does not have a cheese appeal at all. What drew me to this album was the remixers not the songs. I admit that I was not familiar with these bands but was a fan of such acts (remixers)as The Echoing Green (Not Cheesy), The Nine (Not Cheesy), KAJ (Not Cheesy) and Cosmicity (Kinda Cheesy). It was cool to hear these artists and to see how bands (remixers in this case)I follow put their own influence in to these songs. Now I just need to collect all the original versions so I can see how they compare."
4,Couldn't put the book down!,"I am going to school to become a nurse and curious about what it could be like. The book is a little outdated (takes place in the late 70's), but gave details about how busy a nursing area could become.I enjoyed this book and how the Mary interacted with the patients that were kind, angry, upset, etc. She always stood up for herself and confronted issues immediately. Great book!"
1,Can't review if you don't receive!!,The first of it's kind....a book about the real work of a hospital nurse. I read this book when it first came out as a freshman nursing student and have never forgotten it. After meeting the author recently I wanted to re-read this book 30 years later.... UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE MY BOOK FROM THE SELLER!!!
4,Best book for Java developers learning Eclipse,"I found this book a pretty good intro for a Java Developer/Architect who knew Borland JBuilder and Ant very well but who ""just didn't get it"" in terms of Views / Perspectives in Eclipse etc.This book was a good tutorial / introduction to the various features in Eclipse and how to us it (focuses on the 20% of those features you will use 80% of the time). I found Eclipse 3.1.2 was a bit different than the version he used and with Eclipse 3.2 now out (Q2 2006) I'm sure a few more changes have occurred but the exposition style is good and gets to the point.Although I think it is the best book for the purpose, I think those who want to learn and use the Eclipse Java IDE don't have much in the way of quality choices to learn it in terms of books at least."
5,"Together, Barney, B.J., and Baby Bop re-enact classic favorite fairy tales","Best Fairy Tales is the latest children's DVD featuring the beloved purple dinosaur Barney and his fun-loving friends. Together, Barney, B.J., and Baby Bop re-enact classic favorite fairy tales in this Emmy-award winning series ideal for preschoolers 1-5 years old.

4,Page-turning fiction that could be a prophesy,The story weaves a frightening scenario of real world facts and an outstanding knowledge of weapons with a not-improbable terrorist plot.It is obvious that the authors have a solid foundation of fact under their fictional story.
1,I lost faith in anything this book has to say...,"This book is full of howlers!It mentions the shade on the south side of the sphinx - Isn't that the side facing the sun?There is a reference to ""the summer equinox"". There is no summer equinox - only a summer solstice.There is a statement that ""algae... produce more than one and a half times their weight in oxygen"" but there is no time-frame: is that per second or over their lifetime?There is talk of ""the marine life of the river"". Shouldn't marine life be in the sea?I finally gave up in exasperation on page 112 when I was told that ""eutrophic"" means that ""something is eating itself"", together with the explanation that ""eu"" means ""self"" and ""troph"" means eat: To mistakenly use the word ""eutrophic"" instead of ""autophagic"" is bad enough, but to be given a false etymology compounds the error to the degree that I felt I could no longer have faith in anything the the author had to say, and I gave up."
4,My Second Pair of Dijon's,"I love these shoes. I have purchased two pairs because they were instantly the most comfortable shoes I have worn. I live in NYC and walk a minimum of three miles a day, to and from work and it often takes several days (and band aids) to break-in a new pair. These required no break-in at all. I hope they make them in a non-mesh material so I can get them for the cooler weather."
4,Good Service but not an official Tag Heuer dealer,"I have received my Tag Heuer watch within 4 days of ordering, although upon receipt I realised this reseller is not an official TAG Heuer partner which means they cannot issue me with an international warranty card, so that when I am in Europe or elsewhere in the world I will not be able to have my watch serviced.Other than that I have had no problems at all with this reseller."
2,Watch Stops,"I bought this watch for my husband for Christmas and while I recognize that there may be teething issues out the box, he continuously has to wind this watch for continued operation. It would sometimes stop while he is wearing it which suggests that he his left hand has to be continuously active for the watch to continuously work. The longest the watch has operated without stopping is 2 days (taking it off at night). This should not be normal for a watch of this class. I am on the verge of returning it. Are we missing something here"
2,Beautiful Watch...cannot keep time,I recently purchased this watch from [...] through amazon. I received it and it arrived as expected. I could not wait to get it sized and start wearing it. I have know worn the watch 5 days in a row and will set it in the morning and by the middle of the afternoon the watch is already running 20-30 minutes fast. Not hardly the type of time keeping that you would expect from such an expensive watch.
4,Tag Heuer watch,"Great watch, great price. Disappointed it did not come with the International Warranty Card."
1,NOT an authorised TAG dealer,I ordered the watch assuming the seller was an authorised TAG dealer and that the watch would have the standard 2 year TAG International all inclusive no quibble parts & labour warranty. It turns out the seller isnt an authorised dealer!Despite returning the watch within hours of it arriving Im having an awful time trying to get a refund. If youre happy buying an expensive watch that doesnt have a TAG warranty it might be fine but I wanted the TAG peace of mind and am VERY disappointed that the seller isnt honest enough to say they arent an authorised dealer meaning the watch wont be covered warranty wise. Ive paid the extra and bought the watch from an authorised TAG dealer. Pay the extra and buy from an authorised dealer rather than save a small amount and just hope it doesnt develop an expensive fault.
3,Nice item but ...,"No problem with the delivery but I had to pay a hundred additional dollar for customs fees and tax, non-estimated at the begin."
5,LOVE IT,"I listen to this everday by myself and with my daughter. She loves it too, the songs are good to get the word correct. the book it so handy, but the cd's are amazing."
3,"My preschooler didn't like it, quality was average","Overall I thought it was cute although not as good as I had hoped. I was hoping for more of an immersion approach with less English on the CDs. The sound quality was average and I think that for learning a foreign language the sound quality should be excellent. It sounded like it had originally been on cassette tapes and transferred to CDs without enhancing the sound quality.My 3 year-old didn't like it, but that's simply her personaly preference. I can see how other children might love it.There are quite a few references to witches and ghosts (but not in a scary way) and some parents may wish to know that before purchasing."
5,Learn German easily and have fun,"My daughter started taking German lessons from a German friend. After 1 lesson, we purchased the German for Children language series. My daughter has always responded to music and audio stimulation and has learned so much just by listening. We listen to the CDs in the car. My daughter just loves listening to the German for Children CDs. We listen just about every day and have been for at least a few weeks...she has mastered the 1st CD and we're working on the 2nd. I'm also having fun learning the language!"
1,out-of-date,The web site referenced in this article is no longer available. If you want to find out how to get free access to the CPT codes you won't get it from this article.
1,AMA SLAPS DOCTORS AGAIN,Baloney like this is why over 60% of doctors don't belong to the AMA. They still don't get it!!!! The link doesn't work by the way!!!!!!!
5,Top Beginner Book,"This is one of the best magic books a beginner could buy. Just as he does in his other books, Bill Tarr teaches in a way that is so easy to understand and follow. These are some of the best classic magic tricks; every magician should know them. I recommend this book to even advanced magicians. If you don't have it on your shelf, you're missing out."
4,Daughter loves it!,"We had to add ""hair"" to the tiara to make it look a little bit better. My 2 year old didn't break it yet, so I'd say durable."
5,great costume,"Great costume, very durable material. My daughter still uses it as dress up after 3 years!"
5,Wheelchair cushion is a relief when sitting anywhere for long periods.,"As a side effect of drugs I am taking it is painful to sit for any length of time. Standard cushions did nothing, and a gel cushion burst open and ruined a chair seat. When I was looking at a similar foam mattress, I found this thing, and it truly allows me to sit still for an hour or even two,in comfort, and I can sit in my chair for as much as 4 hours at a time, in increasing discomfort. I can even go to volley ball games and sit in the bleachers. Its not that it is so great, its that everything else is so useless.Worth every penny. I have been using it for almost 4 years now. Still looks good, though the vinyl on the bottom seems to be receiving some visible wear, where it is folded over the bottom of hard chair surfaces.The top surface is completely unaffected by years of use, in spite of my weight. Even wooden chairs do not have that good a record."
1,Out of stock when ordered,"In ordering this item I experienced the crazy side of email shopping. The item was out of stock and no one so informed me. The shipping department sent another shredder -- a different brand with different specs. Inside that box was a camera and accessories kit someone else had returned with the proper return docs inside. When I called to find out what to do and explain why I did not want to pay return postage, I was given instructions that I followed to the letter. A month later still no refund. After three more calls to customer service, I got ""disconnected"" twice and finally someone listened and proceeded to explain why I had to wait even longer, BUT the next day the refund was finally posted. Not Amazon's most shining moment."
3,Good...but still very academic,"This really is an excellent book, full of really clear and well-organized information on some very important, often over-looked issues in sociology and family development issues. But I still found it a little too academic-oriented. Am looking for something more accessible to not-well-educated people I work with in my job, families who are not readers. Stories and content are useful to me, however, in a big way, as both a community-based worker and as a serious student of these types of ""non-traditional"" but very current issues. I appreciated the book alot, but it still isn't quite ""earthy"" enough to use with non-academically-oriented clients...other than via me telling them some of the real life ""stories"" encountered in the book. I give it three stars and wait for a second edition!"
5,"Not a want, but a NEED","If you are at all interested in the Dark Tower Series, this book is a must-have. As I began reading the series over a decade ago, it was so helpful to have a guide to flip back to when I came across something I did not remember or understand. My only recommendation is that you not read this until you have read the first 4 books - there is too much info and it will ruin the surprises.That being said, it is definitely worth re-reading the books, if only to recapture the magic that is The Dark Tower, and this book becomes indispensable when doing that. I am waiting anxiously for Vol. 2 of this concordance to be released!"
3,Good but the map is Wrong,"In pag 566 in DT-III the Waste Lands, Blaines talk and said that his route follows the Beam South West. And in the map of this Book It said that Roland Ka-tet follows the Beam South East. So the autor did not make a very good verification before doing this map. so this make me think it could be another mistakes."
1,Yeesh... this series wasn't good enough for this!,"But ... maybe this book is required after all. I mean, the last 3 books were written as if Stephen King threw in whatever ridiculous thought popped into his mind, so maybe we do need this to explain what the hell he was thinking! One reviewer wrote in his review that this book is NEEDED, not something that you just want, so I guess I may be on the right track after all. Now that I look closer, I see that this lofty Concordance was published in 2003, which means that it only focuses on the 1st 4 books. Ah, the good old days, when the Dark Tower series seemed so good and before King's creativity was knocked out of his head when he was hit by a van. It's true, you know - just compare the 1st four books to the last three and you'll se what I mean!"
1,A complete waste of time,"This book gave me absolutely no insight into the Dark Tower mystery nor was it helpful in understanding what the truth is about why Roland hangs around with drug addicts, crippled schizophrenics, vampire nurses, and riddle speaking monorails.I wish and pray that someday all these secrets will be answered for me, but unfortunately this book does nothing of the sort!"
3,Like that it's not plastic,"I like that it is lightweight and dries easily. However, stitching was loose/not done on each of the center dividers, so had to reinforce those. Is a bit small, but to go larger, you might have to go to a plastic item which I preferred not to do. Okay; not wonderful."
5,Great for dorms,It's a surprisingly sturdy little tote. You can fit more than you think in it and it also manages to hold all my shower items which are not light. The mesh is good for water draining so that things don't remain wet.
1,Bathroom/Shower Tote,"The description and photo of this product listing is poor and deceitful.Could not find total size, that it had inside divider and what pocket size was before purchasing. Much much smaller than looks. Order process does not allow for select of color. Waste time and money. Very disappointed in Product, Seller and Amazon."
1,Smaller than expected,"Wish the product description had contained dimensions or at least the product picture had included some items for scale. Thought it was bigger from the one customer supplied picture. Packaging indicates it is 8 inches wide by 6 inches deep, my ruler indicates 7.5 inches wide by 5.25 deep. Not impressed as this is not big enough for what I needed it for and not worth the hassle of shipping back."
5,Fantastic product!!,"The ultimate bathroom caddy!! Some of the others on-line are too deep and it makes it difficult to reach in to get your stuff. Not this one, the right height and size. Three compartments to help organize. The drain hole in the bottom works good. Some of the complaints I've read concern the drain hole, hey it's in the shower, rinse it out every now and then!!It collapses and the strap holds it flat for storage.Here is a hint. Find a velcro arm band like for your I-phone and put it around the caddy's strap. Now you can hang the caddy on the shower curtain rod away from the shower head.Universal Velco Elastic Adjustable Sport Armband Strap for Silicone Cases iPod / Touch / Nano / iPhone / Zune / Sansa / View / Fuze / Zen / and Much More! - Black"
4,Love it... just wish there was an option to pick the color.,"I really love this shower tote, it holds a lot of shower stuff, it's very sturdy, and it's a really good deal for the price. The only problem I have, and it's a minor problem that some other customers also had, is being able to pick the color the seller gives you. I got a completely white tote, which is fine by me, but the picture shows the tote as white with blue trim. I wish the seller would give an option as to which color you could chose. It's a minor problem, but it is something to think about when purchasing this item if you are picky about how the tote will look. Otherwise I am very happy with the tote."
5,cool tote,so i got this a few days ago. and not bad.i thought it was going to be too small for all my things but its perfect. im very happy with it. i had a bag where i carried all my stuff in but sometimes i had a hard time zipping it up if i added extra things in it. so now this fits everything very well and no more zipping up. i like it very much :)
3,Good but there are better products out there,"Pros:Good size - fits everything i needDurableSmall holes on the sides to allow water flowCons:No small holes on the bottom (although there is 1 hole at the bottom, there is still some water that stays)The holding string/rope/part is not designed to be hanged on a shower lever"
2,"Nice tote, but color option not good","I bought this tote knowing we would get a random color sent to us, but the last of all the colors I wanted was white...that's what we got. Very concerned it will get dirty quickly. Would much prefer being able to choose color."
2,shower tote,I like the product but when I received it it was not the color advertised in the picture. The picture showed white mesh with blue trim but in actuality it was a solid green....not the color I expected. In the description it does not specify the color and/or color choices. When making the purchase there was no drop down for a color selection. I assumed I was getting what was advertised in the picture. Disappointed.
3,like a jack in the box at times,The tote is great for the price. I use it when I go the gym. My minor annoyance is that elastic strap used to compress the tote does not stay on.It is like a jack in the box. It will spring into shape at a moment notice.I bought it b/c it would fold flat. I am looking for a large rubber band that may work better.
2,beware of color you may get,"I ordered 2 of these, one for my daughter, one for my son. Quality is good. But they both came in Lilac. I see the website says you cannot choose your color but how about unisex colors? Lilac is not going to be good for my son, now I have to return it and pay shipping. Well, believe them when they say that colors will be whatever they happen to have."
4,"Ok, I suppose.","I gave this to my niece when she left for college. Although she hasn't really complained about it, I thought it was really cheap looking. I was a little upset that you couldn't pick the color you wanted either. But, she says that it works just fine and is holding up quite nicely. A lady at my gym had one also, and she said it was worth the money."
1,Awful,"This is much bigger than I thought it would be and silly for its intended use. I wanted to carry shampoo, etc. to the shower at the gym, but this is so awkward and unbalanced that the stuff just tips out. Also, not easy to hang up or sit on a shelf in the shower. You cannot choose the color, so only ordered if your husband doesn't mind a pink one, for example."
3,Not worth the upgrade from 6.0,"If you have the full version of 6.0 Standard or professional....don't bother upgrading. The new version doesn't add much for the casual user who just wants to print to a pdf file.Also, Adobe has decided they should add more layers of copyright protection to the product that make it difficult for you to add it to more than 2 machines."
3,Fun But Way Way Way Way Too Short,"This second collection from the Bros Warner (and the Warner Sister) is another generally fun collection, but clocking in at under 25 minutes, it's painfully short. In addition, three of the tracks appeared on the previous collection (""Yakko's World"", ""Yakko's Universe"" and ""Wakko's America""). That's not to say that there aren't gems to be found here - the fun ""U N Me"", the borderline-surreal ""Panama Canal"", and the album's highlight, ""The Ballad of Magellan"". But Kid Rhino could have done us all a favor and simply held onto the ten new tracks, then pasted them onto the Variety Pack CD. A good collection, but I'm not sure it's worth fifty cents a minute."
4,Brought to Life - Excellent!,"Somehow I stumbled upon this great work of non-fiction and true to its word, it was certainly a story of love and betrayal in WWI. MacIntyre brought not only the characters to life with flowing descriptions and actions, but also the town itself. While the town was not on the front line, it was near enough to it to see the horrors of war. The mystery of who killed Robert Digby is answered in the end, but it is the middle that is most satisfying, details of his love affair, and the ability of British soldiers to blend into rural France. A true gem!"
3,Facts No Color,"The fact that this is a true story makes it worthwhile reading of history. I finished the book in awe of the people who took such personal risks. The author gives a lot detail that could have been relayed with more interpersonal emotion. Unfortunately this amazing story doesn't unfold with satisfaction, but is interesting."
3,if you are really interested in WW1...,"this book might be for you. seeing as i am but a 10th grade student forced to read this book, i didnt really have a choice. after reading the back of the book, i was actually excited about reading the book but i found what i was hoping for to be much different from the content. i was excited to read about a more social aspect of war(aka the love afair between digby and claire), but it seemed almost casually thrown in at certain places. I didnt really find a character to connect with and nothing about the book was particularly touching. maybe i set my sights too high but this book just wasnt for me."
2,"Sad to say, I didn't enjoy.","At the center of this book is a fascinating bit of history, the story of some of the British troops left behind as the allies retreated in the face of the German onslaught at the start of World War I. My trouble with this book is that this central story is overwhelmed by not especially relevant facts and commentary, making it, at least for me, a difficult read."
3,An even better album,"True this is a good album, and the band is amazing. Their prievious album is more funky and a bit better. The album before that one, their debut album, Moe's Diner is ten times better. It is one of the best i have ever heard, ten stars."
4,BLAZING!!!,"Wow! This horn driven band has really done it with this new release. When I put it in the player, it practically melted. Their music found its way into my bloodstream...an addicting, infectious groove to say the least. Do yourself a favor...check out the sound samples online...you'll be convinced....Foxtrot is for real."
3,"Not Laymon's Best, Yet Still Good!!","This book was also released as Dark Mountain, under one of Richard Laymon's pseudonyms - Richard Kelly.I can see why he released it under a pseudonym, first, as I did not feel that it was one of his best. A little slow to start and, to me, there seemed to be gaping holes that could have been filled in.Still, the book is a quick read and, as always, Richard has given you characters that you will remember afterwards.If you are a Laymon fan, it is still worth reading!myspace.com/horror_reviews"
3,couldn't have seen this as a kid,"I thought I had seen this movie when I was a kid because Bill Cosby was in it but when I watched it recently, I realized my mother would have never let me see it! Definitely an adult movie with adult themes (doesn't Hagman have sex with a coma victim?) Can only be enjoyed with no kiddies around! Nice to see Kietel in an early role. Shows he's had a long career."
4,The last of the funny pre PC Comedies,"I have always thought Ms Welsh was an underrated, underused actress and this small gem of a film with Bill Cosby is the main piece of evidence of my thesis. While its a true product of the 70's, its humor and charm still seems ring thru. I just wish they would make it into a DVD. She should also be seen in The 3 Musketeers."
5,"How do I love Jugs, let me count the ways","I could spend countless words proclaiming the greatness of this film as one of the great urban street comedies of the 70's but just watch the film and it will speak for itself.I do want to mention that the director of this cinematic gem also directed a little number called ""Krull"" which is to high fantasy what ""Mother, Jugs, and Speed"" is to the world of high-brow comedy.Plus it gave us Lysette Anthony."
2,Bad packaging!,"I love this movie. I remember watching it when I was younger. I haven't watched the DVD that I just received yet, BUT...the CD case was busted up when I got it in the mail. I have to watch the movie to make sure the DVD is ok."
3,CRAZY SERVICE,"I FIRST SAW THIS DVD IN A MOVIE THEATER, I ORDERED IT TO WATCH. IT IS GOOD FOR ITS TIME WHEN MADE BEFORE THE CURRENT SHOWS. IT FUNNY TO SEE SOME OF THE ACTORS IN THIS MOOVIE HOW THEY WERE BEFORE HOW BIG THEY OUR TODAY"
3,A funny look at the dark side of ambulance work.,"There are so few movies that are geared towards ambulance work. Mother,Jugs and Speed is in many cases one of the only movies on this topic out there. It is a very light hearted look at the possibilities (and past realities) of emergency medical services. I enjoyed it not only for the subject matter, but also for the cast. Bill Cosby truly portrays the ""burned out"" EMT who still cares for his patients while Harvey Keitel is a great straight man. Raquel Welch adds to the film not only with her screen presence, but also in bringing to light the plight of women breaking into this field. Larry Hagman's character is, in many ways, a disgrace to the profession, and yet he still provides you with a few laughs. I think this movie can be enjoyed by all, but most likely by those who are involved in emergency services of some kind. I consider it one of my favorites and I hope you do too!"
4,"Mother, Jugs and Speed","Bill Cosby, Raquel Welch and Harvey Keitel star in this comedy as Mother (as in Mother hen), Jugs (enuf said) and Speed (a cop busted for selling speed).The story of two privately owned ambulance companies compete for the city contract in LA. our heroes work for F & B run by Harry Fishbine (Allen Garfield). Also as F & B staff is Larry Hagman & Bruce Davidson.This 1976 comedy is cute in spots, but does show its age. Cosby and Keitel seems seasoned for their roles. Whereas Welch seem out of place with this comedyThe film seems grainy and washed out. The story is good, which saves this DVD releaseBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
4,funny,as I am on a volunteer fire dept and was a former paramedic for a private ambulance company this is still funny. And I had great delight in showing the new EMT'S the movie.
5,Must See,"What more can I say Bill Cosby, Raquel Welch and Harvey Keitel. Throw in Larry Hagman (before JR fame) you have one helluva a great movie. Oh and its about ambulances lol"
4,Good for Several Reasons,I am a Professsor of Psychology and operate a private practice. I have used this book as a resource to consult when trying to assist certain clients think more (or think less and feel more) about particular issues. I have also recommended this book to friends and students who want to explore things on their own. Fairly well organized. A good purchase.
5,LOVE THIS CD !!!,"I was looking for a recording of Londonderry Air performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra/Eugene Ormandandy. After listening to several sample clips on this CD, I ordered it. The entire CD is beautiful and relaxing. It's become one of my favorites."
3,Disappointed,"Not the smooth, soft music I expected. Some pieces are good, but it is interspersed with others that are not appropriate."
1,Not the Original Recordings,"Although this is the original Temperance Seven, the recordings are not the original ones which made the group famous. Hits like ""Pasadena"", ""Sugar"" and ""You're Driving Me Crazy"" lack the brisk, confident quality of the original recordings. A big disappointment."
4,"eh, not bad","This is a light, airy read. It has a distinct British feel to it. This work is filled to the brim with very thoroughly investigated research. Yet, somehow, it doesn't at all turn into a bore in the way that so many other historical comparisons do. It definitely puts a different spin on my view of the Victorian era, most specifically, Victorian England. After all, that's really what the book is about. So I suppose the author hit his mark!"
4,The Old Wine Is Better,"Two of the world's great symphonies (or, rather, one-and-a-half) are so incredibly appealing that I don't think it's possible to produce a bad recording of them. I've listened to several, and I keep coming back to this old-but-timeless gem, which, every time I hear it, takes me back to attending a performance with Kurt Masur and the Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestra, when the 2nd movement of Symphony 9 took my breath away, that awesome introduction with the cellos and basses. What a pity Schubert died so young!This disc would be great for any collection - someone new to classical will become a Schubert fan for keeps, and for someone who already has a recording of symphonies 8 and 9, find more room on the shelf for this one, since it ""cleaned up"" beautifully in the remastering and sounds as fresh as paint."
3,The sound is not up to par,"I have had some problems with the 60s great performances, such as Reiner playing Strauss, which I first bought on vinyl 40 years ago. Same with this recording--there is a lot of distortion in the full orchestra passages. A big disapointment, since Szell was a great conductor. The best recent recording of Schuber 8 is by Roger Norrinton, if you can find it."
2,Not all there,"I'm not a qualified music critic, much less a connoisseur. I just know what I like. I first heard the First Movement of the Unfinished Symphony when I played it in my high school band. I've been in love with it ever since.I enjoy reading these reviews, but I'm not as concerned about the nuances of the sound or the style of the conductors or the other issues being discussed here. This is what I do know: I paid for the 8th Symphony and got a CD with an abridged First Movement. There is nothing about this on the CD packaging or the web page. Maybe it doesn't matter and I'm overreacting - the quality of the music is very good and the price is low - but I would prefer to know in advance if any work is abridged."
3,How to blow up EBM,"While Neuroticfish would otherwise seem to be an archetype of industrial/EBM, listening to this EP leaves me wondering whether the artist's ""EBM is dead"" mantra is a eulogy, or a mission.The music is good, energetic and invigorating, sufficiently dark and bitter-sounding for industrial/EBM. And while the music is commendable, it somehow seems more of a vehicle than a devotion.The deathblow to suspension of belief is the ""your ad here"" snippet inserted into the intro, bridge, or elsewhere in the song and its remixes (save for the Dune version). Is it some kind of sardonic statement? An expression of ""EBM has become commercial"" so blatant it grates? Either way, it destroys the enjoyment of the song, regardless of its benevolence or truth.The song is still a good one, and the additional tracks are also recommended. In order to fully enjoy it, you'll have to tacitly accept the jarring commercialism. Which, one imagines, is the opposite of the desired effect."
5,Splendid,"Every book Fr Bunge writes is a little masterpiece, and this is no exception. Here as in his other works he begins with a straightforward concern -- in this case, spiritual fatherhood in Evagrius' writings. He then procedes to explore the writings of Evagrius, which he has obviously contemplated for some time. As the study progresses, he teases out the importance of direction in spiritual life and describes the goal of Christian 'gnosis'. This last bit is particularly worth attention, since somehow the peculiar habit has spread of thinking of 'gnosis' in terms of repressed heresies, Oriental exotica and the like. But of course 'gnosis' was of interest to all sorts of people in the ancient world and it is the signal merit of this gracious little book that it reasserts the claim on 'gnosis' of mainstream Christianity, in Evagrius' time and in ours."
4,A worthy read,"A special forces friend introduced me to ""Gayle Rivers"" by way of recommending his book ""The Five Fingers"". The Specialist is more of a memoir than a novel. While the events in this book take place during the 1970's the operations could be easily translated to what our CIA and Spec Ops folks are contending with today."
4,Outdoor Movies on the Big Screen,"The movie screen was easy to assemble and operate. The screen size and quality were great for an outdoor screen. Our only complaint was the noise from the air blower was too much on the enclosed porch where we were using it, so we ended up tacking a sheet to the wall. The picture was much better on the screen, but at least we could hear the movie. I would recommend it for anyone using it in an open outdoor area."
2,Very Disappointed - failed to inflate,"I purchased this movie screen to show movies at a Vacation Condo Building called the Belmont Towers in Ocean City, MD. We used it one time and it worked fairly well. The only issue was that it would blow around with just a slight breeze. This was partially my fault due to the fact that we were using it on a pool deck and didn't have an area to anchor the stakes into the ground. I knew this may be an issue but still purchased the screen. However, my real issue revolved around the second time I took the movie screen out of the box and it failed to fully inflate. We still have not been able to get it to work and I am going to return this product. I am going to purchase a fixed screen that is not inflatable and I would recommend the same for anyone else looking for a movie screen. * Vantage Resort Realty * www.VantageOceanCity.com"
5,Best Book So Far,"In this world of mediorce technical books that echo available documentation, I have come to depend on Wrox Press, to provide books for actual working developers, that want to get their hands dirty. This book is no exception. The authors provide a very good overview of the .NET framework and the C# language in the first two chapters. Then its on to writing code in C#. Advanced topics in C# are covered well. Developing every day in this language and these technologies, I was still able to expand my knowledge nicely. Later chapters cover COM Interoperability, COM+ Services, ASP.NET and Web Services. This book provides much deeper detail and real code than previous books on C#. I would have liked to see more on the .NET Services and Libraries, which is very important as well as more detail on the IL language. However, this book serves its purpose quite well."
3,Content adequate for beginners - but the book is off-target,"The coverage of C# syntax and structure is adequate, but there are already decent C# language references available (some of them free for the taking). The book's coverage of .NET architecture is rather opaque and not really useful beyond trivia. The updated and new technologies that glob-on to the .NET platform, like the new editions of ASP and ADO, Web- and Win-Forms, etc., are not discussed to a depth that proves useful when you crack open your editor and start writing code.Taking all of that into consideration, I can only surmise that this book is targeted at people with no programming experience who want a glossy overview of C# and .NET. There is very little, if anything, here for those with any level of programming experience in C++, VB, Java, or even jscript."
1,A Waste of Money,"Do NOT get this book. It is a sham. It is unfortunate that I have to say that because I LOVE Wrox books. I have to say this is the first Wrox book I have ever been dissapointed with. There is nothing of use in this book. The examples are useless, too short and not explained at all. You want to learn C#? Just get the free Beta and go through the tutorials included in the MSDN package - they're really good."
1,C# Is it necessary?,"After looking over the reviews and the description of the product it seems to me that C# is not a necessary product. According to the description here:C# is a new object-oriented programming language in development from Microsoft. Based on C++ it contains features similar to those of Java. The intention is to combine the computing power of C++ with the programming ease of Visual Basic.Doesn't this sound like Borland C++ Builder, which has been around since 1996? I'm skeptical.Still, I looked over the book and the language, and don't really see the need for it. There is nothing in the book that convinces me that C# is the way to go."
1,This Book is Obsolete!,"Do not buy this book for the sole reason that it is obsolete. It was written using the Beta 1 so none of the code works anymore. If you don't believe me download the sample code from Wrox and try to complile it. Try the chapter 7 code for files and directories. You'll notice they use ""System.WinForms"" which doesn't exist, plus they try to do things like ""File f1 = new File(""c:\\blah\\blah.cs"");"" Which doesn't work either!"
3,Learn C# and .NET together,"Considering when this book came out, the authors did a very good job. I liked this book better then the Tom Archer book, but not well enough to give it 4 stars.If you want to learn C# and .NET, this book is a great way to get started. If you already know C#, ""Introducing .NET"" is a better choice for learning about .NET. If your main interest is interoperating with COM and using COM+, then ""C# Programming with the Public Beta"" is a better choice.My feeling is that ""Professional C#"" also from Wrox will render this book obsolete.My low rateing for this book is due to the ticking of the clock. As more books become available and as new versions of Visual Studio .NET are released the value of this book drops."
4,GOOD INTRODUCTION ... STILL NEED MORE,"The book did a good job covering C# basics and the Dot Net Framework. It also provided a good overview of ADO.Net.After reading the book I was able to tackle simple programming tasks, but I am left wanting more; Especially in the form of code examples and explanation of the Dot Net base classes. ...."
3,Average book with a few nice touches,"There is very little detail presented here, but the presentation itself is good. This is the first C# book that gives examples using Microsofts Visual Studio .Net product - and provides a few VS.Net hints along the way. The chapters on ASP.Net and web services should have been dumped for more language details."
4,Great for Traveling,"Has a place for everything. Love that it had a place to dispose of used syringes, The only thing I had trouble with was that the zipper is a little hard to use, sticks at the corners."
4,An essential tool for a diabetic,"As I moved from multiple daily injects to using an insulin pump, the number of items that I need to carry seemed to multiply. Sigh! I searched through several different bags to carry my supplies. This seems to be the best option to allow me to carry everything I need. It's just about the right size. It's large enough to carry my insulin pump supplies, but not so large that I can not slip it into other luggage. It comes with gel packs that you freeze to keep your insulin cool. However, I purchased a sheet of Techni-Ice to allow me to better tailor the cooling to my specific needs. First of all, I can use one, two, or three of those sheets to increase or decrease the cooling. Secondly, gel packs have an ugly habit of freezing in lumpy shapes (rather than nice an flat). The Techni-Ice offers a good addition to this case."
3,MedPort Travel Organizer,"The cool-med bag is adequate, but unfortunately the ice packs warm up fairly quickly.By the end of my work day my meds are warm. I believe I will keep looking for another travel med bag or design my own. The concept is good, but the materials are not up to par for the desert climate. I spent more than it was worth. RR"
2,Didn't fit my needs,This product did not fit my need of transporting Lantus and Aphidra pens. The plastic inside was stiff and not convenient for me. I returned it.
3,"OK, but design needs improvement","I use pens (2 types) and have not been able to find a case that holds enough pens for a month-long trip. This fills the bill IF you use the vial holders for the pens -- 10 fit easily this way, which is way more than enough. That said, this case has drawbacks and I hope the maker improves it. On the dry side, the vinyl pouches are poorly thought out and executed, and the material seems set to rip sooner rather than later. On the cool side, the envelope for the gel packs is about an inch short. Stitching is crooked all over. The biohazard envelope is a nice touch but truly you'd get the same result tucking a disposable ziplock bag in that space."
1,Two weeks? I don't think so,"I am very disappointed in this product. The internal pouches are made of a clear, sticky vinyl that is somewhat difficult to fill with syringes. The zippers are cheap and insubstantial. The nylon used for the main body is very cheap-feeling nylon. Overall, the fit and finish is quite unsatisfactory.While I did like the idea of the removable internal sharps bag, I was surprised at how difficult the snaps were - anyone with arthritis would have a difficult time fighting with this feature.It is touted as a 'two week' bag, but I am finding it less than satisfactory if (like me) you use both pens and syringes, as the supplies I packed for the 4 day trip I am currently on have seemingly taxed the limited capacity of this bag."
1,Poor product,"This is a poor product and should be avoided. Poor design with many useless pockets. Large for what it can do. Does not keep items cool for more than a few hours. ""Weeps"" as condensate forms on the outside. Don't buy"
1,Nice nylon case with poor inside design,The inside is stiff plastic. Does not hold my supplies properly. It is not helpful at all and I expect the platic pockets to split long before I get 2 weeks supplies in it.
2,Cheap but nice try.,Plastic all over it's made in China and I got to tell you this was a little to much to pay for but I need it something to help Grandma carry all her essentials. Buy at your own risk.
2,Organizer,Good idea but mine had defect zipper which can happen with any product. For price paid zipper should be stronger
4,Great Travel Product,I purchase this item to assist my wife in the carrying of diabetes supplies. It was the right size for a two week overseas trip and provide a compact organizer for coiming and going through airport security. Great Product would purchase it again if needed.
2,poor2middlin,"More poor quality Chinese crap, way overpriced for what it is. Cold gel packs slightly too big and elastic bands too small to hold syringe/pens. Paid $29 but worth $5. Ripoff!"
2,"OK, but WAY overpriced at $25","I have one from a few years back that I paid $12 for. It worked fine, except the vinyl inside tears after a year or two from plastic degrading. The gouging price is why I gave this a bad review. More stiffing the patients by overcharging for medical supplies.Medport Diabetes Travel Organizer"
2,Medport Travel Organizer,The zippers on this travel kit are cheap and troublesome. They were continually getting caught up in either the fabric behind them or the cold packs. I would not have purchased the product if I'd had a sample in hand to preview (assuming they all have the zipper problem).
5,Very well made !,As a photographer of 22 years I use and recommend this filter. In fact I love all Hoya products. I use it on my Nikon D7000 for casual weekend landscapes pictures. Two Thumbs Up !
2,It's OK...,"This book has a few good ideas for helping you to be more interesting to students, but I found that the jokes get old quickly and most of the ideas are pretty lame. Better advice might be to find your own sense of humor and be yourself! If you truly enjoy teaching and love your students, it will come through in your classroom demeaneor. This book is for those teachers and professors who are so seriously humor-deficient as to be terminally boring anyway, so it might not even help. Give the book a try, but I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it; get it used or borrow it from a colleague or library."
4,En Voyage (Glencoe French 3),"I received the book in a very quick time. The book was more marked up than I thought it would be, but still usable. I could not beat the price."
2,not as interesting as it sounds,"i was tempted by the style and the packaging: paquito d'rivera in an acoustic jazz trio recorded in audiophile-pure live-to-digital. i assumed whatever was on it would be worth checking out. but to me, paquito at his best is sort of post-coltrane blowing meets salsa and other latin beats. this was more one of those jazz meets classical that succeeds at neither. what should have clued me in here was the orchestration -- nothing against the cello or the cellist here, who played beautifully; just not my cup of tea. to me, the arrangements, while pleasant enough, were not especially interesting or thought out, the performances lacked the compelling improvisation of the best jazz, and the songs had all the schmalz of a calle ocho dinner club without the seducto-propulsive latin rhythms. if you like your latin jazz caliente, try ""live at keystone korner"" instead."
1,THis is NOT THE DRIVERS SIDE GLASS,"The glass itself looks to be of decent quality, the only problem with it is it is cut to fit the passengers side and not the drivers side despite the title of the product. I double checked the part number on the package with what was listed in my order, and they all match - yet this doesn't fit the drivers side, it fits the passengers side.Don't order this if you need the DRIVERS side glass."
3,"Worked fine with XP, not with ME","It might just be my ""hand-built"" computer, but I could not get the VIA USB 2.0 card included with this drive to work with my Windows ME machine (a 400 mHz Pentium II). The card was recognized, all of the appropriate drivers were automatically installed and it showed up as ""working"" in my Control Panel. It didn't. I finally dropped the card into my wife's Windows XP machine and it worked perfectly. Didn't even need to use the accompanying CD, it just recognized the card and configured it automatically. I read that Windows ME (and Windows 98) did not natively support USB 2.0 and that that USB 2.0 drivers had to be written by the card manufacturer. Windows XP already has native support for USB 2.0. Apparently, my Windows ME machine does not like the VIA drivers."
5,Wow! This is a really cool product,"The new Pacific external CD recorder is a really cool product. I before had only tried internal CD recorders, i have a COMPAQ PC and this ssems to work fine on it. I love burning mix cd's so i won't have to hear the same songs over and over. This burns really fast as well, so you don't have to wait as long. The best part is it doesn't take that much time to setup, as were internal recorders have to be installed into the PC, the external does not. I highly recommend this product, it has some really cool values to it, so if you are considering a CD Recorder, consider this one before the others."
3,Very poor information,"Never did instructions state unit was not mac compatible.it was printed in very fine and very small type on very bottom of package side panel. Now must go through return/refund process what a pain. Proves never assume. Since unit was a USB port operation, thought it would work with PowerMac G3 unit. Baa Humbug!"
4,"Separate songs, shorter length - It's a good thing!","The word ""Lite"" in the title implies something less, perhaps less bass or gentler drumming, but that's not the case. The source material for No World Order (NWO) and No World Order Lite (NWOL) is the same. The difference is that whereas the original NWO was long, with repeating theme chunks (Worldwide Epiphany, Time Stood Still, etc) appearing in varying lengths throughout a long album format, NWOL presents the music as 10 discrete songs, with distinct breaks between the tracks. I actually prefer this format, as the running length is a more tolerable 40 minutes. It also makes it easier to drop one track onto a compilation disc. The only downside is that some of the song endings are a little abrupt. They could have done a little more fading to make the editing a little less obvious. But they are still better edits than me hitting the ""stop"" button on my CD player!"
3,insanity?,"no insanity here. neither is this sacred. emam has progressed from his earlier efforts. this sounds polished. it is not indo-west fusion, it is no genre music but great to listen to. get hold of one and find out why"
3,"ANEMIC MOTOR, NICE HEADS",This is a nice shaver except for the very anemic motor.The heads are the same ones used in a number of the higher priced Norelco/Philips shavers and they are very efficient.But if you have a heavy beard and/or only shave every couple of days then you will definitely be happier with a more powerful shaver.Mine holds a charge pretty well but that is not too advantageous when it takes as long to shave as it does with the 7180.
1,Worst Norelco I've ever owned,"I have using Norelco shavers since 1960, when my Father gave me one as a gift. I have used several over the years. They usually last several years. I purchased this one on June 30, 2007. I am ready to return it and try a Braun. The battery does not hold a charge. I charged it a week ago, used it twice. [I don't mind looking a bit scraggley] and the red low battery light came on this morning. I then opened it up to rinse it and the head came off in my hand. I put it back on, put the razor away and am going to return it. Very disappointed in Norelco after over 45 yrs."
1,Worst Electric Shaver!!!,This is the worst electric shaver i've ever exprience. Don't know how to return it or dont' have enough patience to go through all that soon i will gonna through it in the garbage. The problem is the basic design of this shaver which always leave some shave in between the gaps and you have to go over it again and agian inviting more razor burn and irritation and spending more time. Don't let this new science ficticious design fool you its good for nothing.
2,Very irritating shaver!,"I have previously used Norelco shavers because they were the only ones I could find that gave me a good shave without much irritation. I needed a new one and decided to try the 7180XL. But it is nothing like the earlier models I have used. After trying it a few times I found that it gives me a major case of skin irritation every time. I tried using a light touch, but the results were the same. I'll have to donate this one and try to find new heads for my old Norelco."
1,Sometimes works,"Most of the time, when one tries to make a pdf document from scanned files, the images of the scanned files come out far too small to be of any use. So, perhaps I am not doing things right, even though I am following the rather simple directions. The problem is, there is no documentation for this program, and the help files are useless. There is an online forum, with a ""knowledge base"", but there are no abstracts of the included items, so unless you have several hours free to read through endless entries, it is also useless. One may call in to talk to Adobe for $40 per ""incident,"" with no guarantee of a solution.This is the way modern software is offered: lots of fanfare and advertising, but all the utility (if there is any) undermined by an almost total lack of documentation, and no help. It would be like offering a car with no steering wheel, no key, no brakes, and no windows, and expecting the customer to be happy with it."
2,not what I expected,"I bought this book to add to a collection of horse books for my teen daughters because I read another of Lynn Hall's when I was young called Tin Can Tucker that I loved. But, this one, I would not want my daughters to read. Even though it is about a 15 year old, it has content that I would not want my teenagers reading. A lot of the story has to do with adult issues. Definately, for the much older reader. I was dissappointed. I did buy it without having read it before. I quess that was my mistake. I just assumed her horse books were for young readers."
4,Boring yet good.,"All in all, this book turned out to be okay. I couldn't really give it a much bigger rating than that because the topic was pretty boring to say the least. The only reason the book was good was because the author has talent and can make boring things seem at least interesting. I usually go for the more spectacular topics, but if you're looking for a relaxing read that doesn't make you think, try this."
4,"Very nice board, pegs seem kind of cheap","This is a very nice board. The finish and construction is excellent. The pegs feel kind of cheap given the cost. It would benefit from using nicer steel pegs. The layout is also a bit non-standard. It is not the traditional up and back, swirl, or perimeter track arrangement. Instead the track is shaped like an ""m"". A couple of times, people ended up pegging themselves in the wrong direction when they were not paying full attention.Overall, I am pleased with the product but if I did it again, I would purchase a 3 track square shaped board with the track on the perimeter."
4,IS HOT and SEXY!,"I have reviewed the same product on December 2010 which is right now unavailable. I decided to copy the other review here.This product met all of my expectations. Price is great and it has very soft material and fabric and doesn't hurt my wife's skin. She says that its very soft and comfortable in bed. It did fit nicely on my wife (64 in.and 127 lb). For the ""One Size"" white was (and is) available although black could make her much more sexy. So I should say even white one on is still so hot. My wife really like it and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it."
1,irregular!!!,"This product was made for some alien species whose breasts probably reach the floor! It just didn't fit right, the bottom was perfect, but the top was just completely off. The breast holes were just about in the abdominal area. Maybe this was meant for seniors???"
5,"Sexy, excellent quality, comfortable!","These tights are super sexy and instantly a confidence booster. The fit was great, a little on the loose side (5'5"" & curvy), which was fine and made them comfortable, without appearing baggy. Love these, I highly recommend!"
1,Not right for everyone,"Its hard to make a one size fits all and make one size fit all. My wife is 5'-5"" and excellent shape and beautiful. It looks sexy on her but not really practical in actual use. The crotch isnt in the right place when I push her feet behind her head, and it rubs the schlong, which hurts."
5,"Exactly as described, very sexy...","This item fit my girlfriend perfectly (plus size). If you find fishnet appealing, then you won't be disappointed with this outfit! Highly recommended!"
3,Body Stocking,"Well lets just say one size does not fit all, if your short you might have problems doesnt matter if your thick or then. But my ladies both said theirs felt good"
4,A really enjoyable story.,I thought The Unreal McCoy was a very enjoyable book. I liked the writing style of Mr. Collins and I look forward to reading more of his books in the future.
5,Chocolate Peanut Nougat,This snack bar probably taste better then 99% of the candy bars on the market with a fraction of the calories. These are close to the taste of a Snikers. I would chose this snack over a Snikers or a Milky Way.
2,Used to be better,"This snack bar used to be really good, but when Unilever began a new marketing campaign with Slim Fast, their production values went way down. Now, every bar is stuck to the wrapper and the nougat has congealed at the bottom of the bar, leaving the upper part of the bar just a drop of nougat between the chocolate coating. It's so annoying because the design flaw means some of the nougat gets left behind, stuck to the wrapper. I have contacted Unilver but have never had a response. Also, I don't know if anyone else has noticed the design flaw in the box -- when you pull back the strip to open the box, you're not really able to reach in and pull out a bar. You have to tear the sides. I contacted Unilever about this a year ago when they first redesigned the box, but I never heard back."
3,Average product,This product is same as described in purchase. Delivery was very quickly and good conditions. I recommend this product and provider. Sincerely. Jose Pena
4,Booker T. Jones and fhe Memphis Group--yeah!,"The members of this group were all individually talented and well-respected as ""side men"" in the music industry. There are other charted songs besides ""Green Onions"" on this CD and if you're old enough to remember that 1962 hit (used in the movie ""American Graffiti""), you'll remember them if not their names. Also the non-hits thrown in make for a better-than-average filler than you'd expect. You can really set a mood wih this CD, but the great instrumentals are not all presented well--not the musicians' fault-still, even at ""only"" four stars, I highly recommend it."
3,ok cd,I liked the cd overall but time is tight is a short version which takes alot from the song. The full version is about 5 minutes long and I didn't catch it when I bought this one. I ordered another that has the full version. Just something to keep in mind.
5,Booker T,This CD brings back a lot of memory. Shows my age but it is worth it. Great songs and easy listening.
5,Music From The Soul,Absolutely LOVE THIS STUFF! Even as a kid this got me moving and I still love to hear it to this day. Timeless music everybody should enjoy.
3,purdy good,"Green Onions is of course classic, but the rest of the album was not what I was hoping it would be. I wasnted more of the sound that is on A Change Is Goona Come, with Trenton Thomas. But if I hadnt had those expectations I would probably have been very pleased with this sound."
5,the very best of booker t and the mgs,"as a lover of good black music, i enjoyed all the tunes,including time is tight,hand em high, hip hugger,green onions. i enjoyed the music years ago, as i do now."
4,Very nice and seems bullet proof,"I've had it with cheap shredders. This replaced a $90 unit from Staples, and what a piece of junk that one was. This one seems more up to the task. It's reasonably quiet (but not silent by any measure) and chews up paper quickly."
4,No Jams No Worry,"I Love this machine. A lot bigger than I thought, but that just means that I don't have to discard the shreds as frequently. Just recently purchased it, but I haven't had a jam yet and I've used it continuously (over hour at one time). I gave it four stars instead of five because nothing is perfect."
1,DO NOT BUY! WAST OF MONEY!!,"OK,So here it is .....100% WASTE OF MONEY, you can remove the shredded pieces and put them right back together. If you are shredding your kids drawings or scratch paper this is for you, if you are shredding anything of value STAY AWAY !!!!!!"
5,FELLOWES 32197,This shredder is a BEAST ... I destroyed my past taxes in just minutes ... I LOVE THIS MACHINE
4,So far so good,I have been using this shredder for several month now and it is meeting our expectation in a moderately busy office of 4.
5,Good Value,"The shredder is the best we have owned. No jams a month in. Runs smoothly and quieter than previous shredders. For the money, I would highly recommend."
5,Powerful and Quiet,"Before purchasing this paper shredder I researched several models and was even willing to spend more to get a ""higher"" end model but after reading the reviews, I decided to take a chance and ordered this model. Part of my skepticism was that the Fellowes shredder we were replacing was over 7 years old and at the time it was purchased was over $500, so I was wondering how so many years later, I could get a better shredder for less cost?? Well, it's possible! This shredder is extremely powerful, quiet and in the few weeks we have had it has not jammed once (it's used daily in a home office). I'm so glad we retired our older Fellowes shredder and purchased this one. We are looking forward to using it for the next 7 years."
4,It's Great,I find it easy to use and easy to store. The look fits right in. I will be telling my friends and anyone shopping for a good shredder this is the one to get. Best I've own.
5,The Best,This is the best shredder that I have ever used. The confetti is also good to recycle into your garden.RF
4,Great shredder!,"This shredder is a workhorse! I shredded our company's entire fiscal year's worth of stuff without a hitch. The only reason I didn't give it the 5th star is because the shredded paper seems to get stuck up under the shredder itself and I've had to go in and pull paper out. I guess if you only shredded a few pages at a time this wouldn't be an issue. But shredding hundreds of pages at a time, it comes into play. I would absolutely recommend this shredder to anyone!"
2,GEARS STRIPPED 15 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE,"Purchased this shredder on February 17th 2010. Within the last week, the gears started slipping and anything more than a single sheet of paper causes it to stall.Prior to that, it was a very good shredder. But, getting just 15 months of use from a $200+ shredder is very disappointing."
2,BE VERY CAREFUL,"Someone tried to shred 11 sheets of paper at one time ON THIS UNIT and it broke the spiraled motor shaft right off...do you think fellows makes replacements parts for it? Hell no. So if you are going to buy this unit, put a big label right on front:DO NOT SHRED MORE THAN 5 SHEETS! NO CREDIT CARDS (even though it say you can) and NO MYLAR OR MANILA PAPER"
5,Environmental Packaging!,"I purchased the SB-97C for personal home use. I was THRILLED when I opened the box not to see any styrofoam. My shreader was packaged with cardboard inserts and I am so pleased with Fellows that this environmentally sound packaging was used. Styrofoam is terrible, and I can recycle these cardboard inserts in my regular household recycling.I wanted to alert other consumers who are sensitive to environmental issues that this product was so well packaged. It is also a great shreader and is easy to use."
5,Serious Shredder,"I wanted a serious shredder to get rid of old tax/medical records/bills. Wow, was I surprised how well this unit performs. With warnings for bin full, paper jam, and finger too close, this is really a great unit. However, this might be overkill for some casual users. I would choose a more inexpensive unit if you do not use it daily."
5,Powerful,"This is a very powerful shredder. It is larger than any other shredder that I have owned. Hopefully, it will be with me for a few years and not burn out like the others. The key is keeping this machine oiled. It is essential that after every full bin, you oil the machine according to the instructions provided in the manual. It is a must that you only shred for 20 minutes at a time...run for 20, let it rest for 20. I love the fact that it has a sensor. If your fingers get too close during shredding process, it will automatically shut off. This shredder also shreds credit cards, CDs and DVDs with ease. I would definitely recommend this shredder to anyone who has a moderate amount to a lot of shredding to do within their household or small office."
3,An Opportunity Lost,"Anthony Blunt (1907-1983) deserves a longish footnote in the history of modern Britain. Son of a low-Church clergyman, educated in a British ""public"" (i.e. private) school, he rose to the very heights of British academia, as an art historian, apparently mainly by dint of high intelligence, talent, and hard work. One of the Cambridge group of young Communists in the 1930's, he also became a spy for Soviet Russia, but was not exposed until many years later, during the Thatcher years. He was also famously, promiscuously homosexual. His story allows for a variety of treatments. One would be low-brow, highlighting its inherent prurience. Carter's book isn't that, I am happy to report. Another treatment would be high-brow, with informative discussions of the British worlds of art and politics in the 20th century. Carter's book isn't that, either, I am sorry to say. It lies somewhere in between, and that is an opportunity lost."
3,"3.5 Stars, Great Psyche Synth Cerebral music","I just listened to this, I got it on vinyl based on the cool back cover that shows Holland with a modular Moog synth. The album is good the first side is good but the lyrics don't seem to be very positive. The 2nd side gets really orchestral and it is what is the best part of the album, because the synth and oboe and other reed instruments interact and there is some great feel that happens that can only happen with some good modular synth music. Sounds more like 70s than 80s but it is very very good. I would rate side one 2.5 stars and side 2 3.5 stars. If you're into cult classics that have lots of synth stuff in them, not synth pop but synth music, this may be a rare find for ya."
4,"Good companion, should not be your only resource.","Great pictures, great review. This will help you learn the material. On the other hand, it does not take into account the variant terminology that some anatomists employ, and can therefore leave you a little confused at times."
2,Poorly organized and not comprehensive - not recommended,"Most of Netter's original paintings which appear in this book are already found in Netter's Atlas of Human Anatomy. Many of the painting in this book were not drawn by Netter and can be less comprehensive. For example, the sub-thalamic nucleus appears only in one schematic painting, and does not appear in-situ. The same goes for the lateral lemniscus. This makes other books mandatory for the study of neuroanatomy. Another drawback is the organization of the book. It's not rationally organized, which makes it difficult to find the right plate. For example, there's a plate of the brain stem and cerebellum. A mid-sagittal section and a posterior view of the same area appear only 9 plates afterwards. Between them there's the spinal cord, the cerebellum, the flow of CSF and more... The bottom line is that you can find more useful and organized books to learn from."
2,A disappointing addition to your TITANIC library.,"Not a skeptic of Reincarnation, I was looking forward to adding this book to my TITANIC collection. Unfortunately, the poor quality of both the printing and the photographs took away from my enjoyment (not to mention typos!). In the author's defense, she has an interesting, meritous story to tell and certainly seems to relish sharing it in her comfortable, conversational style."
2,I Died on the Titanic,"I was very excited to read this book, but somewhat disappointed. To me,the story was choppy and the author seemed to jump back and forth in time. There was little continuity which left me confused and having to read and re-read sections of the book."
5,One of the best books I have read in a long time,"When I first started to read this book I was rather sceptical about what Monica O'hara-Keeton was claiming. I kept an open mind and by the end of part one I was totally hooked. So much so that I didn't put it down until I had finished it. Mrs O'hara-Keeton does have a very convincing tale to tell and after reading her story, I fully believe everything she has written. It isn't so much what she has written, but more the fact that she can back up with evidence what she is saying. Over all, a very good read. One that I would read time and time again."
1,Not in this lifetime!,"As a TITANIC enthusiast and a willing believer in Reincarnation, I was excited to read something different about the TITANIC story. This was an unfortunate disappointment from the time the book arrived...very flimsy binding, cheaply made and fell apart through the course of my reading it. Would have made a better magazine article."
1,Mislabeled - Not Solid Brass,"This is brass plated aluminum (made in China, of course), which maybe is OK for inside use. My intended use, however, is outside in a northern climate. It might last five years before corroding."
2,Not Solid Brass,"This product is brass-plated aluminum, not solid brass as the product title indicates. Other than that, it is fine. The product title should be changed."
1,Warning!! Not solid brass as advertised!!,"Warning!! Although this push plate is advertised as solid brass, IT IS NOT!! I needed a solid brass push plate for outside use. I only chose this plate (made by Stanley) because it claimed to be ""solid brass"" that would withstand outside elements. What I received was a ""brass"" push plate packaged on a cardboard backing with ""brass finish"" printed on the front. The package back noted ""MATERIAL: Aluminum"". I had to modify this plate, and sure enough, once I cut through the extremely thin plating, I exposed aluminum beneath. Spend $10 - $15 more and get a solid brass plate that is twice as thick and last a life time."
3,'phone connector' too large - poor description,"I bought this to connect my GN headset (with QD) to my Polycom phone, and also Nortel and Avaya phones at work. The QD connector is fine. But the RJ connector for plugging into the phone is slightly too wide. Looking online I see now this is described as connecting to an amp, and not to a phone that doesn't need an amp.This product is labeled as:8000 GN-QD COIL CORDQD COIL CORDPART NO. 01-0203J94277Google the part number and you'll links saying the product is to ""Connects the GN Netcom headsets to the GN 8000 Amplifier"""
4,"Good, moderately priced teleconverter","This item, or probably any other lens extender, does diminish image quality somewhat. They really aren't for everyday walkaround use, since you lose one f stop, must use a lens that's max aperture of f4 or brighter and reduce the image quality. This extender does require a full frame lens (not APS C sensor only lenses). This converter does work on cameras with the smaller sensor, it's the lens that has to be capable of full frame. Within its limits, it works well on both my Canon T3i & 60D with the 70-200mm f4L & Tamron SP 70-300 f4.0-5.6. AF won't function very well in dimly lit scenes. Don't forget, if your lens when zoomed out requires the minimum aperture to stop down smaller than f5.6, AF probably won't work unless you have a lot of light. Another feature that does not function at any lens opening is the VC, but when you're using this converter you probably have it tripod mounted, so the VC, IS or VR should be diabled then anyhow."
4,Lives to its promise,"I was unnecessarily concerned about others' moans that Tamron disclaims digital camera compatability. Mounted between my Tamron 18-270 and Canon T3i, this guy works 100% as advertised... REALLY boosts the reach, but at the expense of ~1 aperture stop and a very small hint of the fuzzies. The auto focus and VC work just fine, and purists can switch to manual focus when racked out if they like. I use a ""lens band"" to prevent barrel creep on the 18-270, which is probably why I don't struggle with uncertain focus. I CAN conclude that a 2X converter would likely be too limiting from an aperture perspective... forcing ISO into unwanted realms. Consider: 270mm x 1.6 camera factor x 1.4 conversion = 605mm equiv., so you're well into tripod country, and most ""focus"" moans are more likely ""operator vibes""... and don't forget to kill the VC when using a tripod! Eric - Owner, Fotominnen Ltd."
4,That is amazing!,"Excellent Tele-converter. That works very well with my Canon Lenses, Canon Macro 100, Canon EF 70-300, Canon EF 28-135 and Canon 100-400mm."
2,Will not work with Canon EFS Lenses,The Tamron teleconverters will not work with Canon's EF-S lens line for cameras with APS-C sensors. The Canon lens will not mount on the teleconverter due to the changed mounting configuration (white dot) on these lenses. The Tamron teleconverter works as advertised with full frame (EF) lenses.
4,"buying a 400mm lens,someday.","i mainly ordered this for my canon 70-200L lens but noticed a loss of sharpness and not enough zoom for my needs.it did seem to work ok on the 28-105 with no auto focus problems, on both lenses.maybe the canon version is sharper but its a bit over priced.i may sell the 70-200 and get the 100-400L with image stabilize, when i can afford it."
2,I needed a little more...,"I purchased this book for a Geology class, it was a reading requirement. I don't think it really helped me. The book did not contain enough detail nor did it keep in mind the different learning styles of readers. I do think it was a good read but there really was no A-ha moment for me, considering that this is such an interesting topic!"
2,Buy this for the Crown of India,"Buy this for the rarely performed and recorded Crown of India Suite; it may not be a great piece, but it is atmospheric, evocative, and generally well performed in this recording. For the other pieces, the competition is simply too stiff--stick with Boult (EMI), in particular. Sound is just average for the time it was recorded (1970s)."
3,Slightly disappointed,I received the book and was surprised to see that there was writing inside the front cover. This is something that I expected to be written in the description of the used product. I wouldn't have purchased it because I planned to give it as a gift. It is in good shape though.
4,fun to read,"This book is a collection of old newspaper clippings and family stories about the settling and early development of a lumbering town. Eau Claire was a large hub of saw mills, and other related industry. Two rivers converge leading to lots of 'traffic' via the waterway. Some stories are not 'censored' - as published in the papers of the times. Some items - you wish there was some kind of follow up, because they were so interesting. There is a follow up book, but a different collection of stories and articles."
4,well built,"I bought this pedal wrench from my LBS a few years ago for $12. At $12 this is an awesome well built wrench and I would give it 5 stars. However, at $28 I would go with the Park Tool Professional Pedal Wrench - PW-4 which has a longer handle and gives a bit more leverage for those really tough to remove pedals and that is why I gave it 4 stars. Overall, I have been very happy with it. It is a well built tool and because of the 15 mm wrench in the middle has become one of my go to tools. That 15 mm space in the middle is perfect for tightening the nuts on Fixy/SS wheels. The handle on this wrench is longer than most of the pedal wrenches I have come across, with the exception of the PW-4, and the off set design helps to give you a better mechanical advantage for those tough pedals."
1,Piece of Junk,This sucker couldn't pick up a single channel; not even one less than 10 miles away. I live in a fairly open area.
1,keep looking,"Received my Philips PHDTB1 antenna today in the mail; and after reading the posted reviews thought I was making a great product buy. NOT, only able to receive one channel and not very clear. Your need to look for additional atennas before you buy."
1,Turned out absolutely worthless for me,"I tried these in Arlington, VA and Jersey City, NJ and could not get them to catch even a single station. Reception was horrible both for HD and non-HD signals."
1,poor,the philips phdtv1 silver sensor. was incomplte you only sent top partyou never sent bottom and i didnt recive a usb cable for the attentathe product was no servicethank youRoosevelt Barnett
2,Not very good,"I purchased the antenna for a digital TV recently purchased. I live in the immediate city limits and that should have been adequate. I scanned the stations and had an increase of those found. The trouble is that the antenna which is close to a window and as high as possible loses those signals quickly. I scanned the channels prior to our six oclock news and watch a local station on CBS, then at 6:30 we switch to abc, which has in the half hour lost enough of the signal that it is unwatchable."
2,Junk,"This is a cheap flimsy piece of junk. The signal constantly drops in and out on most channels. It might work if you lived under the transmitters. So would a 3.00 pair of rabbit ears, which I have, and they work about as well as this product. I am less than 25 miles from an area known as Cedar Hill where all the transmitters are located."
4,"Great reception, mediocre construction","I live in an apartment with no clear view of the sky and tall buildings all around. I assumed that this antenna would not get a signal and I'd have to try another. In fact, the signal is perfect and I haven't had one problem with it. I do live only two miles from the broadcast antennae, so that probably has something to do with it.My only complaint is that the antenna itself is rather flimsy. No big deal if you can just place it and forget about it. But since it is very very light, one tug on the cable and the antenna will fly in whatever direction it was pulled."
1,Works Nicely if I stand on my head in Tin Foil Shoes,"Since I'm not going to stand on my head in tin foil shoes while holding this antenna in order to watch free HD channels, I'll be searching for another antenna. As a simple ""rabbit ear"" function for regular analog broadcasts, this thing works well actually - picked up all 9 of the closest channels and one more I wasn't expecting. I got blips and blurbs of only 2 of the 8 local HD broadcasts no matter how I manipulated or placed or aimed or begged this antenna. Additionally it is very very lightweight and I'm sure if you dropped it just once on tile floors, it would break."
5,Houston Tx reception,"This antenna is great. I'm in Pasadena, TX (Houston) and I get everything perfect. It's simply amazing that such a little cheap antenna can work so well.I'm talking digital, analog NBC is fuzzy. But all the digitals come in perfect, no need for an expensive roof or attic antenna. Just point it at Sugarland and you are good to go."
3,Not what I expected :(,"I have the Samsung 50A650 50"" plasma - their Top-End. My 15 year old antenna worked better then this one. Originally I was going to buy ""Zineth"" Silver Sensor. SoI say skip this one, don't waste your money."
3,It works just fine.,"Well, the HDTV indoor antenna is picking up most of the HDTV signals from a nearby big city. It doesn't pick up the local PBS channel but the signal is just too weak. The antenna itself is inside a cabin so it's really amazing that I can watch the football games in HDTV. Talk about roughing it in the country!"
5,Best for HDTV,I have tried a couple of different antennas & this one has worked the best. It is even better than the big ones that go on the roof.
1,Poor antenna,"I wanted an indoor antenna for my new HD TV so save the cost of cable. I hooked up the Philips PHDTV1 Indoor antenna to the ANT input and tried every location inside my 3rd floor apartment. I even got a long coaxial cable and tried it outside on my balcony, but still only a very fuzzy picture. I could get nothing resembling a watchable picture. I will let a friend try it and if it doesn't work for them, I will have to return it."
3,Really should get 3.5 stars....,"I can't fault the product itself for the fact that I live far from most towers, and I purchased the product knowing it would be a long shot. For the one station I have access to, it works okay, but is very sensitive to position. One very important thing that I did not notice is that this is for UHF Channels only, meaning you won't be able to pick up what is 1-13 on the old non-hd system, and possibly some of the other HD channels. Anyways, don't expect this product to perform miracles, unless you live in a city area. Otherwise you are going to have shell out the money to get a nice outdoor antenna."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"Allow me to preface this review with the fact that I've been using another antenna that was just a regular old RCA antenna before ""upgrading"" to this.Compared to this:RCA ANT 145 - TV / radio antenna ( ANT145 )the Philips doesn't come close.Mind you, the RCA isn't powered either. The difference is major. Regardless of the direction it's pointed in.Yeah, OK, there's more to adjusting the RCA, but it's worth the time finding the switch setting and position you need...and if you live in Northern Quebec or in a town of 50 people, neither antenna is going to do you any good. Get a satellite dish."
4,good investment,"well worth the investment.easy to hook up(in my case, to a media center pc)and very good results if you live fairly close(25-35 miles)to the transmission towers."
3,"Middle of the road a ""B"" rating","Not bad, but doesn't have dipoles for analog signals. I live in southeastern MA and got fewer hd stations than with the other Phillips amplified antennas. Try this if you have 15 mile signals you want, but not my prefernce for 30+ mile signals. I rate it a B."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this to replace a set of rabbit ears I was using, which I got for $10 at the hardware store. This unit actually made my reception worse! Don't be fooled: those ""fins"" are made of plastic and don't add to the reception of the unit. Just get a pair of extendable rabbit ears for $10 and you'll do just fine."
5,Well worth the money,"It is hard to believe an unexpensive antenna would work so well. I have a HDTV, but no cable. The antenna brought sharp image to the TV and added 6 to 8 channels I couldn't receive before."
3,Philips PHDTV1 HDTV Antenna is only kind of meh...,"This product on my shelf above my TV has garnered many questions from my house guests as to what the sculpture is over the set. Upon my reply that it is the antenna, a common response is ""Oh, I thought it was supposed to be an airplane."" As far as product quality goes, I have to admit I receive quite a bit of signal interference. At different times of the day, I have to place the antenna in a different spot for good reception. I can't blame this entirely on the product, but I am not completely satisfied. I will most likely be in the market for another HD antenna in the future."
1,"Shoddy product, broke in days, similar Terk solidly built.","The coaxial cable comes directly out of end of fin bar, it broke off. Amazon good about refund. I replaced with a similar looking Terk that is really well built. In Terk, coaxial cable connected solidly to base unit and fin bar makes connection when plugged into socket at top of the base. Superficially in photographs they look similar but Philips is shoddy, poor engineering. Terk also has more heft to it, you want that stability when it is sitting on a table. I've never gone out of my way to write a negative review. They look similar, but if you have the chance to see these in a store you'll see the difference immediately. Or if you look at pictures, study them carefully and you'll see what I mean. Actually looking at picture now on right of page they don't even show the cable, which is a misrepresentation of the product, because it is soldered to directly to the end of fin bar and not removable unless it breaks off and then is unfixable."
1,This thing is a piece of garbage,"I already had purchased a cheaper antenna from Wal-Mart and was pretty happy with it so I thought I would get something a little more expensive thinking it would be even better. After searching Amazon and reading the reviews, I decided on this antenna. Once I received it, I was so, so disappointed. It doesn't holda candle to the $15 Phillips antenna I bought from Wal-Mart. This thing is actually useless as I don't pick up any channels that I already picked up without it and the ones I get are no clearer than they were. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!"
4,Phillips digital antenaa,"I purchased the Phillips Digital TV antenna for use with a portable digital tv set. It worked great. I then connected it to my Samsung 59"" set and that worked great as well. I have Direct TV and when a heavy rain storm is overhead, I lose my signal. I merely change to the TV input using the Phillips antenna and I can still receive local channels."
5,Works much better than I expected,"I own two of these antennas now - one for each TV. Here in Huntsville, AL, it picks up every available over the air digital station, all crystal clear! I'm so impressed that I canceled my cable."
2,Slightly better than rabbit ears,"This antenna didn't do much for us - it worked slightly better than our rabbit ears. It pulled in the signals less than 6 miles away but couldn't do much with those 6+, which is similar to rabbit ears."
3,ok antenna,"This antenna did not fare as well as an old, cheap rca antenna I bought about 6 years ago. I expected a bit better, but it still picked up most broadcast channels."
3,Ok antenna for the price,"This antenna performs a bit better than the ""rabbit ears"" that I was using before. I am still not happy with the reception though, and I will be installing a large outdoor antenna very soon. If the outdoor antenna would not have become available for free, then I would have built one of the OTA HD antenna designs found on the web and put it in the attic."
2,"Not very good at all, threw it away","I bought this over a year ago to use on my HDTV. It is a VERY directional antenna so I wasn't able to pick up many channels because the stations in my area are in different directions. I was only able to pick up 3 digital channels with this antenna. Also, with the odd design, I could only place it in one area of my house, which didn't work well with the antenna. The antenna is very sensitive to placement, slight changes in the antenna will cause you to lose signals. So the bulky design, the long distance between my house and the TV stations (about 40+ miles), this non-amplified antenna sucked. I bought a cheap amplified rabbit-ears antenna and I get around 7 channels, plus I am able to easily adjust the antenna to get other stations.I eventually threw this one in the garbage."
4,Fits its' Purpose,"When I got the antenna in the mail it was exactly what i wanted,super easy to assemble,even more easy to set up.Upon installation I immediately got reception,I had to turn it a bit around the room but thats what we all do with portable antennas right."
3,"Not bad, but definitely could and should be better","I purchased this antenna and it worked so well, I bought two more. That was before the digital TV conversion. Since the conversion, it works no better than my old rabbit ears. Maybe it's because stations haven't boosted their signals enough, I don't know. All I do know is, before the conversion, it worked GREAT. Now... not so much."
5,Works great for HD,"I live in sight of the towers in Portland, OR. DirectTV doesn't have all the off air HD's here. I stuck this downstairs in the opposite corner of the house from where the local towers are located. It was also behind the TV stand/rack to hide it. Receptions is great on every channel. No issues at all."
4,Indoor Antenna,Philips PHDTV1 Digital HDTV-UHF Indoor AntennaThis was the best price I could find. For an indoor Antenna it is one of the better products I have used. It is small and easy to put together and does bring in a great color picture for all the channels (which is un-usual as most will bring in the VHF or the UHF but not both equally well and this antenna will bring both in equally well). For less than $22.00 you get a great antenna.
1,WTF,"With this antenna, after researching antenna's online, is supposed to be the best. But I've gone from receiving 7 to 2 channels!"
5,Perfecta mi antena,"Disfrutando mi antena Philips PHDTV1 Silver Sensor UHF/HDTV Digital Indoor TV Antenna, la recomiendo 100 x % to y lleno mis expectativas"
2,Returned,We returned it because it didn't deliver in my area. I would double check area where you plan on using it before you purchase.
1,very poor reception,"I ordered this based on the reviews I saw. It didn't work out for me. I live in between DC and Baltimore, and got so-so reception using an old set of rabbit ears connected to my new Digital-to-Analog converter. I could pick up a few of the DC channels and a few of the Baltimore channels, but needed to do lots of fine tuning in order to change the channel. So I bought this Philips HD antenna. With the Philips connected to the Digital-to-Analog conveter, I got NO reception of any channels. I don't think I could ever even get above 5% (at least 20 - 30% seems to be required for even a stuttering HD picture). I returned the Philips, and got a powered Terk instead, which works great (80%+ on some channels).Unless you're in a perfect location for HD reception, I can't recommend this product at all."
5,Great antenna for OTA HD reception,"Great little antenna. Hooked it up while waiting to get my HD DirecTV receiver..and I get like 20 OTA channels (near Raleigh, NC). Awesome product."
2,No improvement over old rabbit ears.,"Ordered this hoping for a little better HD reception than my rabbit ears.... There was NO improvement, and possibly even a little poorer reception on UHF channels.I'm returning it and keeping my rabbit ears. The only other improvement I would try at this point is an antenna on roof."
4,Great Antenna for Passive HD!,"I was a tad bit unsure if this antenna was going to be any better than the older Phillips I owned but to my suprise, reception was better and there is hardly any digital interruption. I actually ended up picking up 6 more channels than before. The picture seems brighter and holds a steady signal. I highly recommend this product."
5,Awesome Antenna,"I bought the antenna at Circuit City, just to give it a shot.The antenna was so good that I cancelled my basic cable service and returned the HDTV descrambler or whatever they call it,the same day.I couldn't believe all this time I paid $35 a month for something that is available free.Antenna didn't need any pointing or directing,It picked up all the HD channels available in the area.The signal remained the same wonderful quality irrespective of the position or the angle.I guess my location being in close proximity(6 -10 miles) to broadcast stations also helped.Great antenna."
1,Extremely Fragile Design,"The antenna looks good, but unfortunately is extremely fragile. The coaxial connector essentially fell off the unit during initial assembly. Never got a chance to evaluate the reception."
2,"Works okay, but terrible construction",The coaxial connector on the back unthreads really easily and it's pretty cheap feeling. Assembly is wonky and the base isn't very heavy (falls over easily). Gets okay reception but not as good as I was expecting.
1,Not Worth It,"I recently purchased this product after reading several of the reviews. I live in a metropolitan area, not densly populated with trees, and I'm not trying to get an impressive amount of channels. This antenna does nothing impressive at all.I am constantly dealing with choppy sound and picture, there is no ""right"" way to position it. It doesn't matter what channel I have on, it doesn't matter. It's made out of a cheap plastic and there is no electrrical power. I have tried different rooms on different sides of the house, still nothing. I will be returning it ASAP."
5,Silver Sensor,Great product. I get 24 channels including 7 of my local high def channels. Exactly what I wanted to accomplish with an indoor antenna.
1,Philips TV antenna,This antenna is worthless. It does not give any more channels than we already had which is one. I do not recommend anyone wasting their money on this product.
4,Works better than my powered antenna,This basic antenna seems to work better than my powered samsung antenna. It is temporary so I can deal with the awful look for a little bit.
3,Philips phdtv1 silver sensor uhf/hdtv digital tv antenna,"It is good size, not too big on the table. Still need to move around to receive tv channel. Also some channle still hard to receive."
5,Worked great in a basement installation,"I bought this based on the recommendation the comparison review that looked at several antennas.This was installed in my mom's house. Her TV is in the basement and the regular antenna only gave her a single station. After installing this antenna, she has all the digital stations available in her area (Baltimore, MD). It took a minor placement adjustment to get public TV station reception, but now it works perfectly.For the record, my mom is 10 miles from the station towers (according to antennaweb.org), and in Baltimore, all stations except PBS broadcast from virtually the same location. That makes it extremely easy to place the antenna correctly."
2,Mediocre,"I'm about 20 miles from major broadcasters, my reception was very spotty with this antenna and I would have to point it in a different direction depending on which station(s) I wanted to pick up. I upgraded to the multi-directional DB4 which I've had better luck with."
3,digital TV antennas,"for rabbit ears digital replacement, i am not particularly impressed with this product, and would welcome suggestions concerning better reception. it cuts in and out of most stations.--brd"
1,Philips HDTV-UHF Indoor Antenna,I would say I am about 30 miles from a tower and this one does not pick up any local signals from the major networks. It picked up a few outlyer stations but the reception is poor. I don't know if it's the antenna or just the distance. The antenna is also on the first floor and not near a window facing a tower. I guess I would recommend an outdoor antenna for any others in similar situations. I may try it upstairs to see if there is better reception but I kind of doubt it.
1,Didn't work,We bought this antenna as a test to see if we could HD or any stations on a spare HD LCD tv. We live in the Boston area and there are HD and regular stations available. Followed the simple instructions and this thing didn't work at all.
1,Junk,"I'm a retired radio engineer, and the design looked pretty good to me from the pictures. I ordered two, for two different TVs, expecting them to work better than ordinary rabbit ears on the HDTV bands. It turned out that they work worse. I expected greater directionality (true), but even when pointed straight at the transmitting tower, the signal strength as measured by my HDTV converter boxes is below that for the rabbit ears!"
1,TAXIE,"DID NOT RECEIVE, I WAS SENT TWO SDV2780. I SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED ONE SDV2780 AND ONE PHDTV1. BAD BUSINESS. I DID NOT GET SDV2780 TO WORK."
1,Acehardware a dishonest vendor,"I ordered PHDTV1 model through Amazon for $24.99 plus shipping and handling. However, acehardwareoutlet shipped me SDV2780/27 model instead. Looking up Amazon, SDV2780 is listed $17.99 and PHDTV1 now costs $29.99. There seems to have a swindle going on. Buyer beware, make sure you get what you pay for, or just order the inexpensive SDV2780. I will contact Amazon to see what they can do."
3,Karens swim meet,Karen went to Stoneybrook and joined the swim team and she wants to be able to swim fast. She also has three best friends and they call themselves the Three Musketers. Karen likes having fun and swimming with them also until Coach Carson starts acting mean and says that the team needs to work harder and they are not working hard enough then Karen has to find out what the problem is with Coach Carson and she does that by getting help from her friends.
1,It cost almost as much to return it as it does to buy it.,"WOW--how ridiculous can you get? Since the return policy is so cut throat, then it would have been nice to be warned about it before I purchased useless equipment. I baught this for my husband and when he tried to use it, he found that it did not roll on carpet with ease and he felt uncomfortable with it and could not use it. When i contacted the seller to return it, I was told that there would be a $6.00 fee and a charge of about $15-$16 for shipping. Really? Since when does shipping cost that much? It sure didn't cost that much to send it to me. So after all these fees and charges, I would have gotten next to nothing back. Sure, I'll send you the equipment back and be thrilled that i paid for nothing. How about honesty in description? IF YOUR RETURN POLICY SUCKS OUT LOUD--WARN PEOPLE NOT TO BUY YOUR JUNK. I'll keep it and use it for a plant stand before I'll be screwed over with all those fees."
2,Not what I would expect for convenience,Tried to find glides for the walker but nothing fit. I wanted this walker to be portable. Something I could manage to get into my car etc. It is heavier than I expected.
2,Time Warp,"I am afraid that the industry, radio are feeling sorry for face because there was a big promotional effort for this CD and I don't see what all the hype was about. Face is stuck in a mode of years gone by and does not seem to be able to reinvigorate his musical style. He appears to be using the same formula for creating his lyrics and the tracks all sound similar and like something from previous albums all at the same time. A few of the hooks on a few songs struck me for a moment but then I lost interest just a soon as I began to mimic them. They are also all the same tempo and tone, beginning to drag after while. Face needs some new experiences or something to help help to reinvent himself."
4,Next time try a gorgeous duet with Regina Belle...you won't be disappointed !,"I always liked his music , he's one of the best on the market.Lately he has made some wrong choices , looking for an easier success...The Anita Baker's story should teach him something....I like this CD , but don't think that it's spectacular...It's very much 'Babyface' , which is OK .He needs some pure inspiration , some new excellent musicians , to try a new , a little more adventurous path and sing a song with Regina Belle , the most consistent and brilliant vocalist available nowadays...Just check her terrific latest 'Lazy Afternoon' out...And most of all , he needs to forget the glitz and glamour and... the charts...At 48 , he can't make more mistakes.What we're expecting from him next time is some really fresh , different , QUALITY contemporary music , which can stand the test of time.If he is truly inspired , success will follow !"
1,Another Lost Customer,"What can I say. I don't know if ths is a good CD or not. I ordered it but when I found out that it was copy protected I cancelled it.This is the fourth CD I have cancelled or returned. I include Amerie, Jennifer Lopez and Vivian Green. Looks like my 3500 Cd collection won't be growing anytime soon as more and more CD's come out protected.The industry has no idea how to treat their loyal customers. Thanks to Amazon for letting me know in advance so that I could avoid a return."
5,SOLID ALBUM!!!!!,I LOVE THIS WHOLE CD IS GOOD. THIS CD IS ALL OF THAT. EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS SOLID. BABYFACE REALLY LAID IT DOWN ON THIS ONE. I HAD TO HAVE THIS CD. THIS IS ONE OF BABYFACE'S BEST CDS TO DATE IN MY OPINION. I LOVE GROWN AND SEXY IT IS ALL OF THAT. BABYFACE DID A GREAT JOB AND HE MADE A GREAT COMEBACK . I WISH THAT I COULD GIVE THIS CD MORE THAN 5 STARS. I WOULD RECOMMEND ANY BABYFACE FAN TO BUY THIS CD YOU WILL DEFINTELY ENJOY IT.
3,Comme ci Comme ca,"This is an alright album. Its better than his last one with all the overproduced Neptune tracks. Now he comes back with a modern but yet typical Babyface sound. There are the good tracks such as ""Tonight It's Goin' Down"", ""Grown & Sexy"", ""God Must Love You"" and ""The Gettin' To Know You"". Then there are some boring ones such as ""She"" and ""Good To Be In Love"". Pretty much a half and half okay album. Not good to be in heavy rotation all day on my cd player but its good for a least a listen every day or so."
5,"If I ever need love advice, seek Babyface","This new CD adds to my Babyface collection. He continues to write the most romantic songs. This album is quite a tear jerker, in both positive and negative aspects. One song, he dedicates to the mother of his child and it brings tears to my eyes every time I listen to it. Then there are the songs in which he tells it like it is about men (about why they are, and do the things they do). But nonetheless it is a very emotional album. You can hear it in his voice, and you can feel it throughout the album. I love it!"
3,"NOT HIS BEST,,,,,,WHAT HE SHOULD HAV DONE WAS.....","RELEASE ,,,A LOVE STORY ,(UNRELEASE ALBUM) ,,THAT WAS ALOT BETTER ,,EVEN THOUGH HE ADDED 2 SONGS FROM THAT ALBUM ( THE LONEINESS & GOD MUST LOVE U ),,,I REALLY LIKE THE SINGLE HE HAS OUT NOW,,,(DRAMA,LOVE& 'LATIONSHIPS.....BUT IF U LOVE BABYFACE,,ADD THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION!!!"
4,he'snot a baby!!,babyface is not a baby so if you are looking for a baby that is singing insteasd of a man that is singing than maybe you need to buy a differant cd!! it is not ok with me that babyfce wants to be called sexy because he is not a girl he is a boy and only girls are sexy where i live!!! bethatasitmay babayface sings lots of songs on this cd that will help a lady stay at your house when even after she sees your collection of kitten statues and you tell her that there your moms and your keeping them but she doesn't believe you!! if you want to have girls stay at your house for longer than they were planning to this cd and the songs on it will help you convince her to do that ok?!!
1,"Love the album, but the CD is COPY PROTECTED","I was just a heartbeat away from buying this before I saw that ""copy-protected"" logo on the cover. If the music industry continues to treat consumers like criminals, then its sales will keep tanking. Fortunately, I was able to hear this CD from a buddy of mine, but I would never EVER buy any CD that's copy-protected. When I buy a CD, it's mine to do whatever I want with it. Otherwise, I don't buy it, and the record company LOSES money. It's their loss, not mine."
4,yeaah,"this is a really good album. babyface albums are always a certain buy for me, but this cd was a bit different, more mature in some way, i really like the production on this one."
5,HE JUST GETS BETTER ...,"AS A YOUGSTER I LISTENED TO BABYFACE WITH THE DEAL AND FOLLOWED HIS CAREER UP UNTIL THIS POINT AND WAS EVEN GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO TOUR WITH HIS BAND! SO, I AM VERY QUALIFIED TO TELL YOU THAT HE JUST GETS BETTER WITH TIME. EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS A KEEPER. THIS CD IS FOR LOVERS AND THOSE THAT WANT TO BE LOVED."
2,Hit&Miss,"Babyface in his hey day always had a Cut that was Smooth.""Tender Lover""&For the cool in You were Prime time Babyface. but after 95 after he did the waiting to Exhale soundtrack Babyface really cooled off.""face 2 Face"" himing working with the neptunes wasn't happening. the Problem with Babyface Musically is that He waited too long to swtich up His Music&vibe.this Album has some decent tracks,but the days of a ""Whip Appeal,When can I see you again,for the cool in you,etc... are over.not a Bad Album,but nothing that really knocks me out.good to see Him still doing his thing though."
1,Too Small,"This rack bag would be great on a kids ATV. While it is a great idea, the cover will not fit a full size ATV. We have both a 2009 Polaris 800 and a Polaris 500 and the cover will not fit over the front of either one. The ATV pictured in the ad must be really small. Also each side the cooler part will hold 12 cans, however, if you did stuff in 12 cans there would be absolutely no room for ice. I could only get 7 cans in and still have room for ice enough ice to stay cold for several hours. All in all it's a good idea but a bad design. Too small........."
4,Great tattoos,Our 4 year old son has loved showing of these tattoos at his daycare. Very easy to apply and long lasting.
2,"I've seen worse, but pretty bad","My toddler loves temp. tattoos. So, I've had many. These are no good. They go on fine, but almost immediately start to flake. Then they just look dirty. They're not very easy to remove either as they come off in sticky clumps. I've had some that are almost torture to remove, but these are still pretty bad."
4,Excellent album,"This album is a real bargain as it contains 2 LP's :A jazz date with Chris Connor and Chris Craft with a playing time of 78 minutes. Connor's ""silky"" raspiness is on display with marvelous effect and she is backed by superb jazz musicians. Her interplay with them and her sense of rhythm and timing is remarkable. This set is a real winner all the way."
4,CHARLIE CHAN TO THE RESCUE...,"With this book, the author introduced the hero of the Honolulu Police, Detective Charlie Chan, to the reading public. Charlie Chan is definitely one of my all time favorite detectives. When the violent murder of one of the richest men in Hawaii occurs at his beach front house in Waikiki, Charlie Chan is called in to solve the case.My only criticism of the book is that Charlie Chan lays low throughout the book, while other characters rise to the forefront. Nonetheless, this is an entertaining little mystery that fans of Charlie Chan will enjoy. Since it was originally published in 1925 and redolent of a bygone era, the reader should keep in mind that there is a slightly anachronistic feel to the book, and it may not always be politically correct."
4,Does what it is supposed to do and does it well,"I admit that I have not used it that much, in fact only twice. It did a great job for creating the flare and it lives up to what it is supposed to do. Either I am not creative enough (thus envisioning using it more) or I just have not had the need to use it. But I've always wanted one and am happy to add it to my arsenal of filters. The reason for the lack of the last star is because I don't use it much.B+W make some great filters. Yes, they are often pricy but I have found that as a brand, they create less flaring than other brands. I will probably only buy B+W in the future.A personal opinion: If you are like me and won't use it much, consider which cross star would best meet your needs (4x, 6x, or 8x). I would probably not go for a 4x. the 6x is great. The 8x might be better, depending upon your needs, requirements and personal tastes."
1,Conspiracist Hogwash and Infantile Blather,"Chamish is a UFO chaser who claims there are giant space aliens behind each hill.His ""theory"" of the Rabin assassination has been thoroughly debunked. Chamish has never produced a single shred of evidence to support his hundreds of mindless conspiracy ""theories"". In addition, Chamish is an official columnist for the neo-nazi RENSE.com web site and has been linked to several other Holocaust Denial and neo-nazi groups and web sites."
2,Horrible transfer - excellent documentary,"As with all of the work of Adam Curtis the research and presentation excellent. Howver, I was extremely disappointed with the transfer and wonder what kind of source it was copied from. Curtis deserves better as do those who purchase his work - the sound is not the problem it is the video and I was left disappointed in the extreme and wondering if I needed a new prescription for my lenses. Unfortunately, I do not."
4,Bright and pleasant,"I certainly don't agree with the previous reviews. The only drawback to this lotion is that it does fall short with moisturization, although I find that my skin does react smoothly to it. The ""body glow"" effect is instant because of the sparkles, which like all cosmetic applications, can look different based on your own skin tone and preferences; personally, it works for me. And for me, an even skin tone effect has come gradually with continued long-term use of this product.The ironic thing about me using the Dove Energy Glow line of products is that, as a kid, I was allergic to Dove bars of soap. But in recent years I have become a user of their hair products and now I find myself utterly satisfied with the Energy Glow line."
1,Sparkly and smelly,"I was hoping someone else had tried this product before, but I guess that I'll be the first to warn you. As I look at my arms, I do see that they are sparkling. I'm not sure if that necessarily means that I am ""brighter"", but none the less, I am glowing. This is my first time wearing this lotion and I am utterly hating it. The moment I put it on, I knew that it was a mistake. The smell is awful. You certainly could not wear purfume and this lotion at the same time...the smell would be too much. It is extremely high in fragrance, and not the good kind. I feel like I fell in a vat of cheap purfume. I am even getting a headache from it. Please...if you like a subtle smell or even no smell at all, skip this product and buy something else."
1,Dove Energy Glow Bl0ws,"This product, like all of Dove's products, works exceptionally well. The lotion is nourishing, and leaves you feeling smooth and sexy.And, also as with all of Dove's products, the scent is way WAY off base. It's very floral, overly feminine, but also cheap. It smells like the kind of perfume you could buy at five and dime... or, like my mother says, ""it smells like a whorehouse."" But, not only is it rank, it's cloying. It's too heavy, too strong. You certainly couldn't wear it with another perfume.So, as much as I'd like to give this no stars at all, I'm going to give it one. Not just because that's the lowest you can rate anything, but simply because it does work. If you can get over the smell. If you would like to buy this product I STRONGLY RECOMMEND that you do NOT buy it without smelling it, first."
2,Kindle version review,"The recipes in this book really reflect the meals you'll find in typical Roman restaurants. I was looking for farro, chickpea, and lentil soup recipes, to recreate those I ate in Rome, and I found them here.The Kindle version, however, is very difficult to navigate, recipes run into each other, with the directions for one recipe ending up following the ingredient list of the next recipe, for example. Formatting is a mess, and the fonts used (as others have mentioned) are terrible. As with many Kindle cookbooks, you'll have a hard time finding a specific recipe again.For the price, I recommend against the Kindle version. Similar, equally good, recipes can be had elsewhere.I would recommend the book, if it is ever reissued in a print version."
3,Wanna Look Awesome!,"Do It Yourself Beauty is a fun book. You receive tips from professional make-up artists and from celebrity's themselves! Although, many of us gals, won't get up @ 5am to look this going to school, it's great for sleepovers and when ""girls just wanna have fun!"""
4,"Good, but takes a while to dissolve","I like this product. My doctor suggested I take B12 and after doing some reading, it seemed methylcobalamin was the best form because it was bioactive. Taking high levels of B12 is good for lowering your homocysteine levels and I've read that high levels of homocysteine is a risk factor for heart disease. It's also an energy booster. I like the flavor. The only downside is that it takes a little while to dissolve. It doesn't bother me, but my husband doesn't like it for this reason. Superior Source makes instant dissolve vitamins so if the dissolve time is an issue for you, I'd suggest that brand. I've never tried their B12, but I have the D3 and the tablets are tiny and dissolve instantly. I think they are $9 on evitamins.com. If the dissolve time and size aren't an issue for you, I always buy these. You can get $5 off these Methyl B-12 tabs on iherb.com using the coupon code MOS036."
3,This vitamin has xylitol in it,"Well, crap.For a product that goes above and beyond to offer us the far superior methyl form of B12, and to be appropriate for vegetarians and vegans, the inclusion of xylitol just seems insane. It's a sweetener that some people are highly reactive to. Reactive in what way, you ask? Well, explosive diarrhea, for one. Extreme intestinal cramping, for another. And for some, radical hyperactivity to the point of rage.Certainly, the majority of people who ingest xylitol have none of these reactions. But for the minority who do, and who seek out a ""natural"" vitamin (ffs), disclosure of this completely unnecessary ingredient in the Amazon listing would seem important."
1,"Not recommended as a brand, stay away.","I agree that B-12 is an excellent and necessary supplement especially for vegetarians but the problem here is not the B-12 but Jarrow. They almost always screw up their products and consequently their customers by adding that extra ingredient, unnecessary filler, or allergen. My advice is stay away from this manufacturer, there are so many choices anyway, or if you are taking their products and feeling strange switch to a different brand. Not recommended as a brand, stay away."
2,Short on Substance,"This one suffers the flaw common to how-to books on writing: it's short on models. Plenty of TALK about how to write a treatment, but most writers know that the best instruction comes from an assortment of professionally polished examples. If you want to be a journalist, read the NY Times. If you want to write killer treatments, read some killer treatments."
1,Doesn't explain how to write a treament,"This is a lousy book and spends the entire time explaining why you need to create a treatment and how important treatments are in the entertainment industry, but does not actually teach you how to write one. Very disappointing. The sample treatments included were very unhelpful as well."
4,95.7% on MOUS test,"With NO prior Access experience, I completed the 26 questions on the MOUS test in about 30 minutes (out of the 45 minutes allowed).You will pass the certification test easily after completing all of the material in this book and on the CD.The material is well focused on just that information needed to answer the MOUS test questions correctly.The only complaint I have is that the software on the CD would ""flag"" questions for review that were marked correct on the Test Report and it would not flag some questions for review that were marked as incorrect on the Test Report.Note: I spent about 120 hours going through all the material twice (and experimenting with Access 2000 a little) before taking the test."
3,Driveway Marker,"One of the lenses on the four shattered when I drove it into the ground, apparently because the attaching rivet was too tight. It was just too small a deal to bother about returning. Aside from that, it is as advertised."
4,Fallen Angel was a great book!,"This story was great, the author took to totally different people and made them work together. A gun fighter and a semi-nun, supposedly half brother and sister. He loves her very much from the beginning it seems, but not in a brotherly way. She is confused about how she feels, not sure if its sisterly love or a love a woman feels for a man. It is really funny, not to give some of the story away but I thought the part when he's undressing her to put her to bed and isn't sure if he should take off everthing or not, it goes from there to her waking up naked and thinking the maid must have done it, anyway she soon finds out how it really was and gets furious and losses her religion to curses she throws at Jake. This was my first book of Catherines' but I do believe I'm hooked. Can't wait to start my collection of the rest. I recommend this book, it will have you crying, laughing out loud and in love with both the characters. I truly enjoyed it"
4,May be a bore hazard.,"When I first read this book I was bored after the first hundred or so pages. It sort of takes the steam out of the book when the characters declare their undying love, marry, and concieve a child all within the first chapters. But there is some later action and events worth hanging in for. I'd suggest you check the library for this one first."
3,Terry and the Pirates,"This is original TV, low budgets TV at best, but with the comic book heroes ""Terry and the Pirates"" brings Dragon Lady back to life. As hokey as this video series can be, the stars actually went further in their careers than you might be led to believe. Basically Terry works for a cheapskate Chineese businessman flying surplus C-47s around the Far East, primarily China. again this is a nostalgic look back into early TV where you might have seen Texaco's Milton Berle, Roy Rogers, and Ernie Kovacs. Take a shot, grit your teeth, and remember this was a TV show from the earliest days."
4,Loved it,"This show inspired me to become a secretary, which I just retired from after 48 years. I had more than one ""Mr. Sands"" and hope I was a Suzy to at least some of them. The resolution is good considering how old this series is, and my only complaint was that it didn't come with closed captioning, which I unfortunately need at this point in my life. Otherwise, it was a lovely surprise and a warm memory. I would for sure recommend it to others."
5,Combining the best of western and native healing,"Through the experience of native healers from 35 tribes and his own career as a physician, Dr. Peate takes the reader on the health path. The author tells us that good native healers combine the best of their heritage with modern medicine. In other words, they use what works. The also provide what current health care often under values such as the importance of the doctor-patient relationships.At times the book reads like a good novel, with stories and examples. And like any good novel, it's hard to put down.Through story telling, Dr. Peate illustrates how people get themselves healthy, or in the case of the terminally ill, maximize their remaining time. He shows us the methodology of native healers in the healing process.The book is chock full of practical exercises and suggestions for keeping oneself healthy. This book is a must for anyone interested in combining the best of western medicine and alternative approaches to health."
4,For fans of Dying Fetus,"I bought this CD sight unseen just because of how cheap it was, but when I got it home I found that I really enjoyed it. Recourse mix death metal and hardcore in much the same way Dying Fetus does (did), but not quite as technical or densely riffed. They aren't breaking any molds here, but the music isn't so generic as to quicky bore you. If you like Dying Fetus and are a little forgiving when it comes to lack of originality, you will probably like this. If you haven't heard any Dying Fetus and are somebody who is getting bored of stuff like Pantera, Fear Factory, Slipknot, etc. this might be a nice stepping stone for you. If you are really into that new trend of hard music (I've heard it called NWOAHM by some and metalcore by others) like Killswitch Engage, Lamb of God, Atreyu etc. you may find some value here, tho I am by no means making a direct comparison to that subgenre."
5,Great figure!,"I love this version of Brainiac! Great line of figures, I would have liked to yave seen more from this line,like Liberty Belle, Johnny Quick, Firebrand, Amazing Man and more."
5,I liked it! Mesmerizing music video tunes and fun visuals,"I liked it! Kaleidoscopic images of Australian landscape and wildlife with visuals of people dancing, playing and trancing. I found it eye catching with special effects, cityscapes with deserted outback highways and mother nature's greatest accomplishments, I was fixed to the screen from beginning to end... try it with lights switched off... a great trancy effect!"
2,Great Product but POOR Company,"I have been satified with the product, but they would not process my rebate because I supplied a PO BOX & physical address. I understand they have to make money to remain a business entity, but please...do not make offers you do not plan to stand behind!"
3,Documentation Issues,"First of all, Not clear to me how I access other Buyer's reviews of this product?? Or any Product b/f I buy it??The Hardware itself appears to work OK. I'm upset that NO paper Manual included on how to use the Software! I need to use 2 computers: one to read CD-Manual & other to attempt to get Software to work! W/o the ""Wizard"" feature, I would NOT been able do a simple CD-Copy Burn. Although specific Sections of Manual written fairly well, it is not organized well for the Novice (ie. me)! Specific Basic steps appear to be missing in some explanations! I can see me spending hours trying to figure out the manual's instructions & waste many incorrectly-burned CDs! If there is a feature to ""Preview"" what is to be Burned, I have not found/seen it yet! I have not had time yet to see if PD's support will be helpful."
2,Poor Quality and code mistakes,"The quality of this book is the lowest.Its boring, code won't run, sentences repeat themselves.I don't think there was any QA reading done on it.It looks like trying to be quick outside at the marketwith a .NET book without making sure that the code suppliedin the book actually runs."
2,Not great to be Advanced Level,"Book's back cover says user level is Advanced. If you are a VB.NET programmer or C# programmer (or atleast know anyone of these) oly half of the book is for you. Most irritating part of this book is that, each example it repeated twice. Once for C# and once for VB.NET. It even repeats the HTML part, which, ofcourse, does not change with language.Another part is, Reference part. It has a good idea of explaining all class memebers. But this just repeats whatever is in MSDN. It should include explainations to things which are not trivial, after all, this is why anyone buys a book for. If we try to convince that its alternative to MSDN, we anyway need MSDN because many of explanations were not detailed enough to be understood.Its a good book to start with and if you are in a hurry to learn in a short span, its a good option. But certainly not for Advanced users and users who wanna know in-depth"
2,not very useful,"The title is a misnomer; the book is really about half reference and half tutorial. Unfortunately, it does neither well. The tutorial coverage is hit or miss and shallow. The reference section is less useful than MSDN.You can do better than this, and you should."

1,Really awful,"Alex Britti isn't so talented, or at least he continues to write stupid songs (with really silly lyrics), and sometimes his style can be irritating. It's a real pity that many other artists in Italy, who're surely better than Alex, haven't got the same radiophonic promotion. I hope things will get better, but now the Italian musical landscape makes me wince... Definitely a bad album; if you don't want to waste your money, please, don't buy it."
4,A lot of helpful info!,"I liked the book I am currently getting my husband ""out there"" and this book gave us some very helpful tips on getting started!!! Thanks!Shelly KinderCincinnati, Ohio"
4,A must for event producers,"Just a quick note to say how pleased I am with Denise Bella Vlasis' latest book. If you produce corporate events, private events or anywhere that you use unique entertainment this is truly a wealth of information. if you think you've got the ""look"", then this definately is the best road map to success you can find to become a look-a-like and professional entertainer. Thank you Denise for a job well done!"
4,A great resource and entertainment.,"In this book one is taken aback by the quality of the look a likes that the author uses, then the amazing generosity of information for the aspiring performer to get into this surreal business. It is both entertaining & educational, how often do you get that?"
5,A Must Have in the Industry,"This book truly is a must have for anyone who is thinking of starting a career in celebrity impersonation. In fact, I recommend this book to anyone thinking of starting a career in the entertainment industry, period! The author's tips about how to get started in this field cross over into most fields of the entertainment business. I work as a choreographer for many acts & recording artists & I always suggest a copy of this book before we get started!

Great gift idea!
1,Not the real thing,"This is only an interpretation of John Williams' epic soundtrack. The music sounds similar, but its terrible when you think of how good the original is. Why waste your money on this, go buy the real John Williams' CD's, This CD is an utter disappointment. It sounds like one whole MIDI file on CD.. just TERRIBLE"
5,The Best!,"Star Wars! Everyone know what it is. It`s been around for many years. It`s one of the best Science Fiction movies it ever made since the movies of Star Wars was released in 1977 and the other two, a couple years later. It`s still remember by people through the years till now and into the future. I`ve heard the three Star Wars themes and it is so good. Great sounds! Everyone should bye this cd? It`s the best! ""May the Force be with you!"" P.S. Star Wars will always be remember forever!"
4,Awesome - except for one thing.,"The display is exceptionally clear. The remote is easy to use, although the feature which remembers where you were when you eject a disk is a bit confusing.The disappointment was that my hi-def CRT TV made in 2002 (Sony KV-32HV600) does not support the upconversion to 780 or 1080 - the picture is squeezed on the top and bottom. If you have such a TV, call OPPO tech support before you buy - they are very helpful and knowledgeable."
5,great upscaling DVD for $200,"I didn't want to go HD DVD yet, so in the meantime I did alot of research and found that this OPPO was best buy for buck. I upgraded from Neodigits HVD2085 High Definition DVD Player which worked well for me, although once and awhile a got macro blocking on some DVD's. So far this OPPO has been an improvement, not huge like I was expecting but no issues with any DVD's and a improvement over the Neo in clarity with my Mits 1080p 52632. I'm probadly used to it, but any of my friends that watch a DVD say its really clear and highly detailed picture. If your in the market for a upscaling DVD to cover a gap from going to HD DVD or Blue Ray, this will work for you."
4,Good for the time period it was relevant.,Great for the days when you needed an upconverted dvd player. Nowadays it's obsolete but Oppo is one of those premier brands over any normal consumer grade hardware. Obviously now we don't need these with new tv's and if you wanted quality you would buy the blu-ray.
5,Outstanding value,"Just received the OPPO DV-981HD and it lives up to all the excellent reviews. I have a Samsung 46"" LCD 1080P and the upconverted DVDs look great, it might not be true HD but it comes close and its nice knowing I don't need to update my DVD collection. Setting it up was easy, the manual and onscreen menus are clear on the settings to use. Just wish I could find the universal remote codes for it."
3,"Ok, but my PS3 upconverts better.","I got this so I didn't have to play Dvds in my PS3, but the Oppo player seems to output more noise and then the PS3. I did all that Oppo said to do like turn of noise reduction on the TV and settings but little or no change.I put a monster m1000 hdmi cable on the Oppo to see if it would help but it did not. The PS3 upconvert seems to have a smoother and sharper picture. I will still use the Oppo because I don't want to wear out my PS3 as a dvd player."
1,Poor quality,I paid $229.99 10 months ago. Now throwing it in the trash. Quit working and I don't play it that much. Not impressed with Oppo. I will not buy another one.
3,No big deal........,"I saw no difference between my $34.99 Wal Mart DVD/VHS combo player via coax cable and this Oppo 981 using an HDMI interface. I played the same movie, Aviator, simultaneously on a Samsung 4096D 1080p 40"" LCD TV, switched between sources and saw little/no difference. I think the audio was a little better from the WalMart unit. It works, has a nice picture, easy hookup, so still 3 stars, but no big deal."
2,Great sound. There is no difference graphic.,"Base on the high reviews on Amazon and Cnet, I was excited to get one. Amazon shipped the product super fast. Plugged in the HDMI cable to my 2007 Panasonic plasma, adjusted the player settings, nothing looked better. Noticable was the sound. Sound is way better than the normal dvd player. So I bought the Panasonic upconverter for $100 and the graphic is acceptable than this Oppo 891. Good luck. Hope you have better luck than I did."
3,Buy a Toshiba HD-A2 or HD-A20 HD DVD Player Instead. HD DVD plus Up-Convert!,"Why would you buy this player when you could buy a Toshiba HD-A2 or HD-A20 HD DVD Player for the same price, and you would get the up-converting capabilities and get HD-DVD capabilities thrown in for the same price?I debated this with myself, but when the price of Toshiba's players dropped, I made the plunge, bought the HD-A20, and am very pleased with the purchase. HD-DVD is fantastic! SD up-convert is great too."
2,Gone too far!,"This well footnoted book makes a much needed critique of organized religion across most denominations today. Historical roots of many common practices are explored and several conclusions are inferred. In my 30 years of pastoral ministry, I share many of the observations and concerns made by the authors. I do believe that in their zeal to confront error they also error in many of their conclusions, in fact, ""throwing the baby out with the bath water"". I believe we can drive into a ditch on either side of the road of God's truth- In the end a ditch is still a ditch.The Biblical model for the New Testament church is clear; they meet corporately together, devoted themselves to apostolic doctrine and they cultivated communion and deep fellowship ""from house to house"" (Acts 2-4). It's not one or the other - it's both!"
2,Be sure you know what you're getting,"It's my fault that I didn't look more closely, but this is not really an HD player. There are other, less expensive, true HD players out there. I returned mine."
4,Great player,"Packaging was great.Remote is nice to view, glow-in-the-dark really comes in handy and doesn't waste battery life. I wish the buttons had more texture to key ones, but instead you can differentiate mainly based on button size which is hard to tell sometimes.The picture quality is excellent!"
2,Never again,"While I liked this well enough when I bought it, but it failed on me after less than 2 years of use. That's shorter than any electronic product I've ever owned. I replaced it with a Sony that was less than $70 which is providing picture quality superior to this. Last time I get sucked into spending this kind of money on a DVD player."
3,"Great audio, but video has ""Ghosts"", splotchy blacks","Does anyone else get a ghost (a retained picture) of the previous image when this thing goes to a dark/black scene? What's up with that? I'm using the HDMI cionnection with a Samsung 4051. Noise reduction off. Faroudja on. It causes splotchy blacks in DVD playback pictures. Very noticeable and annoying.Otherwise, the audio is excellent in CD, DVD, SACD, and DVD-A...especially for the price. It's too bad the video has this image memory problem though."
4,Can't beat what you get for this low price,"This is an excellent buy for the money. Until PS3 and blu ray drop in this price range (currently $229), this will be an unbeatable deal for upscaling your existing movies and DVD rentals. I just wish I could figure out a code for the universal remote for this product."
2,Would not play homemade DVDs,"I bought this two weeks ago and looked forward to getting it. However I was very disappointed that it would not play my homemade movie collection. The only discs it would play are store bought movies. Everything else freezes up within minutes of starting. Picture quality was good and I thought the menus, remote, and general ease of use was fine, but that is besides the point if you can't watch your movie."
3,NO HD DVD Here !,"With all the hoopla and jargon written in the reviews and product descriptions, it may not be clear to the less HD-schooled that these players DO NOT play HD DVD formats.I bought Planet Earth in HD DVD format, anxious to enjoy my new HDTV and fairly decent JVC DVD player, only to find, surprise, surprise, that my JVC wouldn't play HD DVD. My bad, no doubt. So I did some research and the common refrain is to upgrade to an up-converting DVD player until the ""Blue Ray vs. HD DVD thing"" is straightened out. Well I am surprised to find out that this brand new Oppo won't solve my problem either.One can't help but feel that there's a bit of swindle going on in this HD marketing."
3,Just got this,"Looks a little better than my old dvd player, but nothing like watching HD tv. 720p HDTV looks better. Not worth the money"
2,Upconverter???,"I bought this DVD wishing to improve the picture quality of my old dvd collection. I didn't notice anything when compare to my old $33 dvd. I don't understand any review made on this item. The image is not even close to hd 780p, so why is this DVD called upconverter HD 1080p? The upconvertion might be because it has a HDMI output, but nothing else. The images displayed are comparable to any other dvd player. I'm going to keep it anyway because it is very flat and it fits my cabinet. But if you are looking to upconvert your old dvd collection to HD 1080p , forget it. The only way to watch HD 1080p is with the blueray dvd or the HD dvd.In other hand, I believe that if you have a high-end HDTV they come with internal upconverters that won't let you notice any difference when comparing this product to any other dvd. Keep your money for... !speakers!."
1,Why I only gave 1 star,"No where does the info for this product does it state that it does NOT play HD-DVD discs... Therefore the info provided is not complete... If your looking for both the ability to play HD-DVD discs and up grade to near HD DVD, This is NOT the player you should be looking at. Also, if you want to be able to get other remotes to work with this product, they do not have their codes with larger manufactures so they can be incorporated. The unit itself plays back great, but impossible to integrate with other manufactures equipment... Better spend 30-50 $ more not to suffer the inconvenience."
4,OPPO DV-981HD 1080P Up-converting,"OVERALL Great product. Up-conversion works extremely well with the Farudja technology!! If your unsure about which HD format to go with, then purchase this OPPO and up-convert your whole library and wait for the ""FORMAT WAR"" to finally be ended. I love the HDMI connection, so simple. Only gripe is unit makes alot of noise when first loading your DVD/CD into drive. Also when paused the pause ICON stays on your screen until you hit play (not good if your taking screen shots). WOULD BUY AGAIN! OPPO Way to GO!"
5,Great DVD Player,This is a great machine. My old DVDs look great when up-converted to 1080p for my Sony LCD tv. Since the older format DVDs are so much cheaper than either the blu-ray or HD DVDs it will probably be worth it to just stick with them rather than up grade an entire library and buy one of the expensive high definition players
3,The good and the bad,"I bought this unit so I could up-convert my standard DVD's to 1080P because I bought a 1080P television. The video quality on this unit was great, but there were some things they could improve. I did not like the remote, it seemed very cheap, and I could not find the code so I could program one of my other remotes to control the unit. I could not find a code for Oppo in any of my other remote code lists. I also thought the DVD tray was very cheap looking and I was afraid I would break it. If you can live with the remote and the DVD tray, picture quality was very good.I ended up returning it and bought the Panasonic DMR-EZ47V combination VCR/DVD recorder which up-converts standard DVD's to 1080P. I really like the Panasonic, and the picture quality is just as good as the Oppo in my opinion."
5,Oppo DV-981HD Universal DVD Player,"Very satisfied with this player. I did have trouble getting it to work with my AV receiver. I kept getting a ""No Signal"" message on my AV receiver. So being a novice at this I simply ran the HDMI cable to the HDTV and it worked great. Well worth the money. P.S. I still get surround sound from my setup."
3,DVD's from other regions don't work properly,"I used this player for four weeks. This DVD player is region free and it should play DVD's from all regions. The local DVD's work fine and the output was good too but DVD's from other regions don't work properly. My father sent me some DVD's which I tried to run on this player. These DVD's played fine for the first 20 to 25 minutes but after that it gets stuck. I played the same DVD next day and I started where it stuck last day. Same thing happened, it played fine for the first 20 minutes and DVD didn't get stuck where it was stucking last day but it got stuck after playing for 20 to 25 minutes. I played the same DVD in my laptop and Sony DVD player. The movie played fine without getting stuck. There was no problem with my DVD's. The Oppo DVD player was unable to play my DVD's properly. I am returning this player."
2,Buy an HD-DVD player,"Had for a few days and returned it. Picture quality was good but the Toshiba HD-A2 with SD discs is better. Plus you can play HD-DVD with the Toshiba. I have no use for the other formats that the Oppo plays: SACD, DVD-Audio, PAL, and DivX. The price on the Oppo and the Toshiba is the same. In fact, the Toshiba is cheaper considering you get 8 HD-DVDs from Amazon and Toshiba when ordering any Toshiba HD player. You do the math. Oppo is overpriced and overrated. ""Plays as well as players costing 2X or 3X,"" is outdated and misleading. It doesn't play better than the Toshiba, doesn't play HD-DVDs, no free HD-DVDs, and they both cost the same."
3,No mp3,"Product is great as advertised, however, will not play mp3 disc. Big downside if you have large mp3 collection."
4,Excellent Player....,"Outstanding pictures for regular dvd... Of course 1080p from this player can't compare to blu-ray or hd-dvd. But for under $200 price with such high quality, it's unbeatable. I had to settle with a refurbished one, because the wait for new ones was too long for me. It carries a year warranty same as a new one anyway. So far I've been happy with it. The only two complaints that I have, are the dvd tray and the batteries' cap on the remote. They are little bit flimsy. The batteries' cap on my remote already broke when I tried to change to batteries. That's why I only gave it 4.5 star...Other than that this OPPO DV-981hd is the way to go for those who like watching movies in near high def quality but can't wait for the settlement between blu-ray and hd-dvd."
5,"Pinnacle of upconverting DVD players, excellent pro reviews","Excellently tested to do very well in detailed tests like on Audioholics dot com. It is quite pricey for what I bought it for about 230 for the unit. This is the top tier puncher though, Oppo is the one to watch. Plays super audio cd, divx as well. Highly recommended"
4,Great upscaling DVD player,"Great player. Added to my home theater so that I don't have to replace my dvd's with blueray dvd's. Don't expect Blueray quality images but pretty close. Haven't found a dvd it doesn't play. Has HDMI and fiberoptic audio outputs which I use for my 7.1 system.Negatives are the dvd player and remote materials they are made from seems of inferior quality...kind of thin. Also, remote buttons are small symbols are small making them hard to press and read. Also somewhat of a long power up time.But overall, don't regret buying this one at all. Worth every penny."
3,Good while it lasted,"I got 2.5 years of use out of my unit. While the picture quality is very nice (I find myself not happy with any other dvd player except blu ray after owning this OPPO), 2.5 years of on average perhaps half an hour's use everyday is way too short! Called the customer service, but find it too much a hassle to send in to have it fixed -- besides I don't know how long it'll last after it's fixed this time."
5,OPPO-Fantastic!,"This upconverting DVD player lives up to the hype and then some. My Sharp Aquos LCD display doesn't deinterlace 1080i correctly, but looks great when fed 1080p by the PS3, so I was anxious to find out whether an upconverted DVD signal would be better at 1080p. Well, this player blew me away. the picture is absolutely gorgeous and the detail is stunning. No contest...of course its not true HD but on the best DVD transfers it is very, very close with the Oppo's fine deinterlacing. Highly recommended!"
5,Excellent quality for a great price!,"This is an excellent dvd player for those witha 1080p HD TV. I recently purchased a Samsung 1080p (40"") LCD display and wanted to get a decent player that would upconvert regular dvds to near HD-DVD quality. This one does just that.The only issue I had with it was the remote, which was dead as a doornail when I received it. 2 minutes on the phone with Oppo technical support, and they shipped me a replacement remote - works like a champ. All in all, a great player and great company."
3,If all you do is watch movies,"Then this is a great DVD up converter. This player also reads DVD data disk. MPEG3 audio files are good and replayed without any up or down conversion. JPEGS on the other hand are down converted before up converted to the full 1080p format. Major loss of resolution. Oppo clearly put features in for viewing jpegs in slide shows, however they totally missed the boat on resolution. Had I known this, I probably would have waited before I bought. Unfortunately, the tech specs on this player do not specify the JPEG resolution capabilities.Up conversion of movies, by its nature, creates graininess. Oppo offers noise reduction that smooths this out, however you then get haloing around moving objects which is an artifact of noise reduction. The haloing gets obnoxious at the higher noise reduction settings."
5,Unbelievable,Everything I've ever read about this product is true. even before he took it out the box my installer was impressed with the package and when he ever got it hooked up he was hooked as well fell in love with it but since we do not cheat in my house she was all mine and I love her!!!!! this is a great great product
3,Not terribly impressed,"I did a lot of research into upconverting DVD players and found that the OPPO DV-981-HD came with glowing recommendations. After paying around $200, I set it up and tried my regular DVDs. I tested them on my regular DVD player, then put them into my new OPPO.Both were played on my brand new Mitsubishi Diamond 57"" DLP high definition (1080) television so I knew that any quality issues would not be from the television, but from the DVD player.Although the OPPO played them nicely, I didn't really see any difference between the different players. I assumed that any upconverting DVD player would make a ""night and day"" difference, but not so much. I wouldn't buy it again if I had been able to test this machine in a store, which is why I really like to visit a brick and mortar store whenever possible to get a real demonstration."
2,Not as good as reviews,Not sure why everyone thinks this unit is so amazing...Have a $70.00 Samsung DVD upscaler 1080p player that upscales my dvds to equal if not slightly better image quality then this $200+ unit. I even tried a $75.00 Monster HDMI cable but the player is still not worth the price tag.
2,oppo dv981hd,"Suspect this was a used/returned product from Amazon---internal packaginghad been previously opened! Unit performed OK except for jerky, blurryimages on some DVDs especially those with action scenes. ""Upconverting""was disappointing. Super Audio/DVD Audio was subpar compared to apanasonic unit."
1,DVD player DIED on me,This DVD plaayer just up and died on me after like 12 months of extremely light usage....we probably watched like 10 movies total on it. total joke.
5,Such a deal!,"The Oppo DV-981HD DVD player offers the features of HD-DVD players costing 2 or 3 times as much. Using a HDMI interface you can see your regular DVDs ""upconverted"" to near Hi-Def.After spending only $229.00 for my Oppo HDDVD player, I was prepared to go out and spend another $50.00 for an HDMI cable. To my surprise it was included in box with the player.This player is priced cheap enough that you can enjoy Hi-Def DVDs now, while you wait for the DVD, Blu-ray wars to settle on a winner."
4,It is a nice DVD player,"This DVD player is really good. It displays your DVDs as best as they can be on your HDTV. Remember DVDs are only 480P, so it's not high def by any stretch. After watching HD for a while, you will want to get a Blu-ray or HD DVD player. But if your like me and don't want to commit to a format until a clear winner has emerged, this will make your old DVDs look as good as possible."
5,"Amazing value for a solid 1080p, multi-region, multi-code, multi-voltage player","This product is amazing. I compared it side-by-side with a Denon DVD-2910 and a DVDO iScan VP30, all through an SDI connection; and I still believe this $230 Oppo player beats the Denon/iScan combo ($3000) in terms of perceived resolution, smoothness, and color presentation. (I say perceived resolution because both are supposed to output the same number of lines.) On top of that, this player is capable of supporting multi-region (PAL<->NTSC) and multi-code (Region 0), and you can plug it into 220v power source too! I am not saying everyone cares for the worldwide compatibility, but it will work wonders for me because I relocate sometimes."
5,OPPO!,"So far so good! I thought the same thing many other thought, how could a no name brand get so many positive reviews, I thought there was a gimmick somewhere. No so fast, this little baby really does kick some serious A$$. This unit coupled with great HDMIs and a 50"" Plasma make my world go round!"
3,Cable,Works just fine for uploading video to my PC. I needed to purchase some sort of card but all in all it worked.
2,Not bad for a first contact,"Good introductory text, with structured presentation. Needs more challenging case studies and exercises."
5,So Much Detail!,"This is a great doll, & great quality. The hair is so soft and the clothes are very nice. The company did not skip any step in creating this doll. This doll is very good to give as a gift to any girl. Well worth the price!"
1,"really, really not worth the money","I had a very hard time enjoying this book. I felt like there was little to no character development, a meandering plot, and a completely unsatisfying ending. I haven't struggled so hard to get through a book in a long time, and the only reason I didn't just give up on it was because it was the selection for my book club. It was 240 pages before anything interesting happened, and then even that plot line was poorly followed through. I am sorry, but there was almost nothing in this book that spoke to me. I am glad I got a used copy and spent only seven dollars, but even that felt like too much."
4,In-depth insight into three lives,The character development is fascinating. I felt that I grew to know these 3 daughters. (Many Yiddish words throughout the novel and that may interfere with comprehension.)
2,where'd that title come from?,"i'm going out on a somewhat snobbish limb here to say that i doubt many crimson fans know much about jack kerouac and neal cassidy and what the HELL do they have to do with this sort of music? man, EVERYbody knows that jack dug bop and had no use whatsoever for the sixties. i gave it two stars cuz that's my general reaction to about 80% of this band's output - i admire them, respect them, had a great afternoon laughing with fripp one day though he wouldn't remember. but i don't care all that much for them"
4,A Small Complete Reference Guide,"This small book is a very good guide to modern and some old tanks but it can be more oriented towards the more acknowledgeable reader. It is a good book for people who now little or some about tanks but has too little information for someone who has considerable knowledge about tanks. This book has great pictures, specifications, armourment, and other small facts as well as some development history. I would highly reccommend this book to anyone who likes to raed about modern day tanks. This book doesn't include much on experimental tanks though."
5,Very Informative,I bought this for my 11 year-old nephew. It is a perfect mix of pictures and written information. He loves it.
4,From a Truman straight to the Heart,Read it! This books needs more support behind it. It could be the next big read and certainly has cinematic potential. Read it and pass it along. Enjoy folks. What a great read!
4,Hitler in Hollywood?,Interesting historical fiction about Nazi influence in the Hollywood of the World War. More than a little chilling in today's context.
1,Junk - shedding after 3 months.,"Loved it for 3 months, then the bristles started breaking off at the base with only the slightest touch. Fortunately they float, so you can skim them out. Never had a brush fall apart like this - pure junk! Wish I had purchased from a retail store so I could demand a refund."
1,cheap!,"i have only used the brush about 6 month; ones a week. Today, the aluminum back literally shattered with i was brushing my pool!"
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"If you are concerned about sound quality, do not waste your money on this one. I have purchased other Sony 3CD sets, and was impressed by the quality of their mastering. Not so here. This one sounds like it was taken from the fifth or sixth generation tapes. Poor highs and distorted bass. Yuck! :("
1,Not for this region!,"I love this movie, but the copy that was sent to me does not play in my region USA. I don't know if it was my bad or bad of the shipper but now I have to find a new copy and am upset about it"
3,A Bizarre Mix!,Trying to fill holes in a collection or replace old 45s should be easier.There should have been a better way to get hold of Sock It To Em JB and I Spy For The FBI - but I didn't find it!These two tracks alone were worth the purchase.Anyone know how to get hold of Baby What I Mean by the Drifters?
2,Not Happy want to return,"Not happy with bag. I plan to return it I'm just not sure how to do this. Could you please send me instructions as to how you want this item returned and how my card can be refunded.Thank you,Amy Peterson"
4,more,"A brutally honesy portrayal. His mom offers some great insight. Would have loved to see interviews with his siblings. The 16 mm footage is gorgeous, but the concert clips in this were way too brief, perhaps the performance weren't shot in full due to the expense of 16mm. I wish the interviews with Neko Case and Chan Marshall were more than 10 seconds; their full interviews should have been included in the Bonus material. As it is, the Bonus Material is odd. A BET outtake of Dexter playing an instrumental, bad concert footage, and distrubingly bad segments from some god-awful production by something called ZTV.This is a must for fans, but I am not sure if the uninitiated would be able to follow what is presented. Nice to see though that Dexter has appeared to come to an understanding of where he is and how he got there---something that everyone can relate to. The overwhelming impression is that his life journey probably wouldn't been much different had he become famous."
2,incomplete,where is dexter today; its here but overall this doc is short on his heyday...touching at times and its obvious Dex is a complex person. this film is not.
5,Much better than I expected!,"A simple review will not due this book justice. If you are serious about trading for a profit in any market, then this book is a must have. Anything on the internet about price action trading is derived from this book. Buy it! You will wish you did it sooner!"
5,Excellent,"This is probably the book I use the most out of all my previous textbooks. It is very easy to carry and perfect for rapid reference. I sometimes even use it to show patients the pictures so they understand the pathways of the nerves that may be affected by their condition. I also frequently lose it because I carry it so much--I'm on my 2nd copy since residency. Some of our most well established and experienced neurology professors still used it. There is a new edition now, but looks similar to this edition. Well worth it."
1,"Really bad book, especially if you are dummy","Seems like author was really in rush to get this book out.The book is poorly organized. For example the topic about DNA and how sells operate presides the actual explanation about sell structure.Many term the book covers have no pictures available for them (had to buy separate atlas).Too many details and information, barely explained.I returned this book, and I don't recommend this book. The Anatomy and Physiology idiot's guide, is the best intro book available (see my review)."
1,Save your money! Try something else,Borrowed this book from a friend. Found it pretty much worthless. Save your money. You can learn more from an on-line tutorial.
4,Good Place to Start,I bought this book so that I could get some of the basics down before taking some college Anatomy/Physiology classes. Most of the book is easy to follow and it does cover the basics of the differnt systems in the body. Some of the chemical charts may be confusing to understand. Overall this book served my purpose and I feel I have a good foundation for my college classes. Pretty much anyone with a highschool level of education should beable to follow most of this book espcially if the topic interests you.
3,Pretty basic stuff,"A&P for Dummies is a good starter book for people taking A&P I. The material is very basic but has some good information and tips for remembering different aspects of a given system. I would recommend this book if you don't know your AHEM... from your elbow. Also, if you haven't used your A&P for a while and you just need to brush up on the different systems, then it's okay for that too. So, go for it if you are still wet behind the ears or a little long in the tooth so to speak."
1,Good read but hit and miss if you are taking Anatomy & Physiology,"A good book to read if you are not using it to supplement your Anatomy & Physiology Reference book. It missed so much important information that will be relevant to your class or specially your exam. If you are trying to get an A in your Anatomy & Physiology to get into Nursing, Not the right supplement for your studying. You are better off to buy Cliff Notes or just read your book from school - do not waste your money."
4,A good book that focuses on the important material.,"I'm not sure this book will help you pass an Anatomy and Physiology class in school, but it'll definitely help you learn the material. Unlike most textbooks, this focuses on the important aspects of Anatomy and Physiology and it doesn't go on and on about things that you'll never use in a clinical setting. I was hoping that parts of the book would be more detailed like the vision section for example, but it's definitely worth 10 dollars."
3,Not what I expected.,"I didn't get as much info from this as I'd hoped. It was very sophomoric for the college course I was using it for. This would work for maybe basic, beginner High School anatomy."
4,a and p for dummies,"The book gives different views ,trys to help you understand thru metaphores,andhas a few good pictures ie. the kidney ,and is worth owning."
4,The Servlet chapter rocks!!!,Jason Hunter has done it again. His servlet chapter is simply awesome. He offers some really juicy bytes of information. Give the man more chapters. The other chapters are good too. I would give the book five stars but the Performance chapter is worthless. That came as a surprise because I enjoyed Jack Shirazi performance book.
2,Realy old but good guidelines,"This book discusses really old technologies, but about 20% is timeless good information. I would suggest looking for a newer book that has similar material."
2,Disappointed.,The book is surprisingly thin and lacks necessary detail about J2EE patterns. I think the Expert One-on-one J2EE book is much better.
1,"Cheap piece of junk, don't even think of buying",This case isn't worth a dollar. Its built of cardboard and couldn't protect even the cheapest guitar. Tissue paper might have been a better choice.
3,Military soldier always on the go.,"Well this is my first guitar case i had ever purchased. I just bought my first guitar in my life and i wanted to go at a cheap price for the case, just in case i didn't enjoy playing guitar. Well at $30 you can't beat that for a cheap price, even for a semi-hard case. I am a soldier always moving around between deploying to and from afghanistan and then back home. the case seems to be holding up to its price. I have had this case for about 2 almost 3 months already and have moved many times in that period and its still intact, astonishing.like some people have said there is nothing inside to keep the guitar from moving all around the place. there is a little storage area under the neck where u can place your picks and your tuner, but not big enough to place your extra strings. the big portion of the inside has a deep well for placing guitar books, at least thats what i use it for with my guitar inside. other than nothing special about it. alright for beginners."
3,get what you pay for,I got this case cause I needed somthing to transport a lower end guitar occasionally. It is thin and has no kind of linning on the inside for protection. It is cheeply made and I don't think it will hold up to much. If you just need something for occatioinal use this should be ok but don't expect too much. It did get here on time is one good thing I can say.
3,Madden 07,"Great game and endless fun using your favorite teams. My only frustration with this game is the unbelievable load times. Just to bypass pre-season took over 4 minutes. With a three hour portable battery life, that is a pretty big hit. I love the control and the features of the game and the decent graphics made up for the wait time. Besides - you have to love any Madden game, just because its well, Madden!"
4,PSP Madden 08,"I have not played the 06 or 07 versions, but I am pleased with Madden 08 on the PSP. The animation is good, the controls are intuitive and responsive, and the amount of extras is welcome. Load times are not bad either.My only complaint is that I find it very difficult to run the ball at the higher difficulty levels. A 14-10 game that ends with 200 passing yards and 10 rushing yards for both teams is not very realistic. If you play on the easier levels the stats even out but you'll easily spank the CPU opponent. I'm hoping that I just need more time with the game to run the ball more effectively.Overall, if you want to play football on the go, I recommend this game."
5,Targus TCG200 17 CityGear Miami Messenger Notebook CAse,This case is wonderful! It is well thought out and has most everything that I require for my laptop needs. I only wish that it had a spot for my mouse to reside by itself for quick and easy access.
5,A great bag for a widescreen or regular laptop!,"If you have a widescreen laptop, or even a smaller one, this bag is for you. It has lots of pockets and places for everything! There is enough room for everything you might need to carry and the construction seems very good. I am very happy with my purchase and heartily recommend this bag!"
4,Nice bag for the price,"Like everything made by Targus this bag is strong, has plenty of room for stuff and the only reason I did not rate it with 5 stars is because the shoulder straps are not removable. Great product !"
4,Great Laptop Bag,This is a great laptop bag. I just picked it up from a garage sale for five dollars! It was a bargain. It has plenty of room for just about everything I need and much much more.
3,Could use some work. But it's still pretty decent.,"This is one drawback of getting a 17 in. laptop. There are not as many choices in laptop bags. This bag works fine but doesn't have all the neat features of my old 15 in. bag. This bag offers good padding and protection and should be more than sufficient for anyone that is only going to carry their laptop in it. Don't plan on packing alot of extras because it just makes this thing too bulky. The pockets weren't designed to handle what I need to take with me. The removable phone pocket is kinda silly too. Hmmmm, maybe I just miss my old bag."
5,good laptop bag,"plenty of space for my large laptop and accessories, and of good construction/quality.I highly recommend buying this bag and Amazon worked great as a seller."
5,Targus TCG200 17 in. CityGear Miami Messenger Notebook Case,"It came to me as described. Got here fast and packaged well! I registered it on the Targus WebSite which is cool cuz it provides info towards the warranty. As soon as I finished, I took my Toshiba 17in. Satelite P305, put it in the case, and.....Presto>>> There is plenty of room for it. Heck, there's plenty of room for my laptop,(even with a sleeve)and all my accessories(mouse,cables,discs, pens,or whatever else I want. You Get The Point..) I also like the hidden water bottle holder that's stashed in a zipper on the side of the bag. I love this bag!!!! Great Portability and comfort! No Problems as of Yet!"
5,Look no further! This is the bag for you!!!,"I did a lot of research before purchasing this bag and, let me tell you, this bag has it all. It's light-weight and comfortable on the shoulder. And, who can beat the price for such good quality??? Stop looking and buy this bag before they run out!"
5,Best bag yet,"I've owned several computer bags and this one is very well thought out. It isn't heavy considering how big it is and it's a very well made bag. I had plenty of room for my new HP dv7 17"" laptop plus the pwr adapter, a tabletop recorder, tapes, 3 inches of files and paperwork plus a couple of paperbacks for a meeting last night. Even had room to spare! The organizational section in front was wonderful. Instead of having to pull everything out to find stuff, I just unzipped the front to open it out and had everything neatly at hand. I'm very pleased and this is definitely a great value."
5,"Excellent Messenger Bag, Especially For Large Laptops","A very comfortable bag with plenty of space for storing papers, cords, chargers, a large laptop and any other odds and ends you might need. The clean lines lend a professional style that is great for work or simply traveling around town. Compartments are convenient and easy to access. Highly recommended."
4,Glad I purchased it.,"Very happy with the bag, had it on two long trips to Central and South America and it performed great. Plenty of room for everything I could possibly want to carry on the plane. Only a minor wish...when I have it really packed with a lot of stuff, I wish it had a strap across the chest that clipped like true hiking backpacks as I believe it would sit better on my back. But overall very happy with it and would recommend it to others (and have)."
1,Big and bulky - I returned it,"The title really says it all. The bag was big and bulky and did not have much space to keep accessories. The body of the bag had no give to it, so even when it was empty the bag was huge!"
4,City Gear Notebook Case,The case is nice but I could have saved 50% by waiting and buying local with a clearance sale that was advertised in the aflyer I received.
4,Good case,Good quality case with useful pockets and space.It is just too big for the notebook that Amazon matched to buy together. It's more for a large laptop.
4,Sturdy and easy to carry on your shoulder,"I replaced a laptop backpack figuring at 51 I should get myself a big boy laptop bag.Plenty of compartments for paperwork, folders, organizers etc.Zippers work smoothly."
2,Doesn't hold up well,"I've had this backpack for about a year now, and I use it daily. My swissgear lasted much longer. The inner lining on this one has ripped and is just tattered. Not the best bag for the money if you ask me."
5,Computer to go,Bag is attractive and very sturdy. The computer fits securely and is well padded. I recently used it on a trip and was able to place other carry on items in it and it traveled well.
4,Targus TCT200,"I have only used the bag once thus the 4 star rating. It seems to be sturdy enough to protect my 17 inch laptop when I take it on the road. It has enough pockets to take laptop accesories like a mouse, mini cam and other adapters along with little problem. For a fairly inexpensive bag to transport a laptop I would highly recomment this one.Targus TCG200 17 CityGear Miami Messenger Notebook Case"
5,So Far Very Good,I bought this for my new laptop (Dell XPS M1710). I find that it fits everything I need and then some. I have not had any problems with this item as of yet. I have owned Targus items in the past with great results. I just don't have anything negative to say.
5,Great,"This bag is perfect for the new Dell 17"" laptop we bought, fits like a glove. The bag is well manufactured. I would definitely recommend buying this bag."
4,Works well,Works well much more stylish then my previous bag (according to wife). Wish it had just a little more room or ability to expand out as I carry a lot of legal pads with me for various notes. Would recommend.
5,great,great carying case im still uding it from about 2 years andits too strong and its taking too much things and paperes its big thanks
4,Very functional.,"This works great for my 17"" laptop. It's got plenty of room for the laptop and other office on the run necessities. Well made, sturdy, comfortable, roomy. Only thing I would like to see, more color options."
4,Targus TCG200,I bought this bag in April of 2008 to house my then new Toshiba A205-5841 laptop.I wont bore you with a long drawn out analysis of this bag.I will say that despite the questionable yellow writing on it (courtesy of Targus) it's still a good almost great laptop bag.It holds my laptop and laptop peripherals perfectly.
3,"Plenty of pockets, but a little small","This is a very nice looking bag, but isn't the the most expandable. In fact, I was rather disappointed at how small the packing space actually is. On the other hand, the available room is nicely parceled out with lots of pockets to store smaller items. Just don't think that you're going to be able to carry many more larger things, like books, when your 15"" or 17"" laptop is inside."
4,Great laptop bag!,"This bag is a tad bulky, as is to be expected considering it is for a 17"" screen laptop. Plus, like me, having a big screen is good, so I expect the bag to be kinda large.It is a really good bag. Lots of rooming for storing stuff: MP3 player/PDA, Mouse, jump drives, cables, laptop plus a couple of text books. It even holds my ear phones in the flap and my power cable it one of the inside pouches. It has a colapsible side pouch for a water bottle (or Mountain Dew). Which I don't really use, but it is nice to know it is there if I ever need it! :)The shoulder pad is nice because carrying a 17"" laptop with accessories and a big text book like I do to class gets really heavy.I would highly recommend this bag to anyone who wants space to carry their laptop with its accessories along with other items and look casually stylish."
5,Great bag!!!,This bag fits my Dell Studio 17 wide screen perfect with plenty of room for accessories too. Plenty of padding for protection.
5,Excellent value for the $,"This is a very reasonable case for a large (17"") laptop. I'd feel more secure if there was someway of locking the 2 downward opening zippers on the front pocket, but I have not experienced and problems with them.The ultimate feature for a messenger case would be a partial redesign in order to make the bag checkpoint friendly."
1,Warning - Bag Will Distroy Slacks!,There appears to be several styles of this bag named after different cities. The version I owned is the Messenger - Miami version. I can't comment on the other styles of this bag.My wife bought this Targus Messenger Miami bag for me at a local store as a gift for a new job I had started in downtown Chicago. Around the same time I bought several pairs of new slacks to look professional. I walk from the Metra station to my office about six blocks every day. After about four months of doing that I noticed that my slacks were getting worn out around the hip area. That is the exact place the bag rests while I walk. The back side of the bag has a mesh pocket that acts as sandpaper. Just about ruined $200 worth of slacks. I immediately stopped using this and switched to a backpack style bag.No bag that rest on your hip should be made out of a rough material so this thing is junk. I've attached a picture in the gallery so you can see what I mean.
3,Targus Laptop Bag,"I spent a lot of time trying to find the right case to carry my HP Compaq 8710. Due to the 17"" screen size it does not fit in most bags. The laptop fits nice and snug in this bag. Unfortunately there is not much room for carrying other items compared to bags I have used in the past. I travel quite often and need to be able to carry necessities for fairly long flights. This bag is not large enough to accommodate all of those items, but I am able to get by. For the price and more importantly the ability to handle my large laptop this bag is a winner. I just need to find another way to carry my other items or go without."
5,great bag,"This is a very sturdy and roomy bag! It holds my Acer 17"" laptop with room to spare for other computer related items. I like the shoulder strap, very comfy, but probably use the regular handle more. Thanks again for the great product! Sue"
2,A bit small,"This bag is alright for around the town, but doesn't have enough space for travel. It does not have enough room to store the charger without being bulky and potentially hurting the laptop."
5,The Perfect Fit,"...for my HP Pavilion 17"" notebook. I got this bag to latch around my desktop replacement. It does fit my notebook and some essentials. I can fit in the laptop, the power adaptor, an iPod, some DVDs, spare drive, a book, keys, mouse, earphones, some documents and a few cables. If I place other stuff like the Express TV tuner, remote and other accessories, it gets a little bulky.My only complain is that it has few dedicated compartments for all of my main peripherals. But for $26, hey, that's a bargain!"
2,Buy a different style,"I originally bought this because of the messenger style. I'm still a fan of that style but this bag is trash. The shoulder strap is uncomfortable and not removable. So first thing I did was cut it off and attach my old strap. The flap is not very well secured, while holding the bag by the handle your laptop is exposed to dust and the weather. Targus should have used Velcro instead of the plastic buckle. (hmmmm I just thought of my next modification >_>)The bottom of the laptop compartment does not have any rigid padding; just very soft and thin padding that will not protect your 17"" notebook if you happen drop it or sit it down with out precaution on a hard surface.The over all color is nice, the yellow lettering is a little tacky but does not take away from the over all aesthetics."
4,Glad I got this bag.,"After much research...I got this bag.Pros:Reasonably light (3 pounds empty I think).Reasonably sized (not as slim as my old bag...which had no padding)Has a removable Accessory bag for my mouse and power supply (pretty spacious!). This was THE feature I wanted.Lots of pockets/places to store things, lots of room for documents, pens, accessories.Suprisingly easy to carry, either by handle or strap...Oddly more so than my unpadded older case. I guess it might be the padded handle and padded sides. It's comfortable to carry around.Cons:No dedicated ""slots"" to hold my 802.11g card, I stick it in one of the secured pockets. No big deal especially since My new laptop will have built in wireless.No space to hold a large (I mean large) book, normal books should fit easily (a bunch of them actually).I don't use or carry CD Disks with me, so that feature is pretty useless..but I guess nice to have."
5,Sandy Backpack,I needed a durable backpack for my notebook on my deployment in Iraq. I've been using it for over five months now. It has handle sandstorm and the harsh climate. I even modified to carry many of my military items including my rifle (hanging on the front d-rings). Thats an estimated weight of 50 lbs. and sometimes more. Not only I suggest this backpack but the whole entire line of Targus notebook bags since many of my co-workers actually have the same brand.
5,"Very good 17"" laptop case","I received this item in a very short period of time (3-4 days; standard shipping) and it works great. It is very sturdy, well constructed and has a flexible computer pocket so it can be used with various sizes. Also it is great that it has so much storage to keep all of the necessary items for mobile computing. Also of note is that it is very light even with a 17"" laptop inside with all the accessories. A very solid purchase."
5,Nice bag for the money,Computer bags are usually expensive. This one is a bang for the money and right what I was looking for. To my surprise is not as heavy as I thought it would be. My 17in laptop fits perfectly well and there is plenty of space for a couple of books if not more and other gadgets. The color is neutral and looks good on the shoulder. I think will get a good use of this bag.
4,Great Product,I love the CityGear Miami Messenger Case. It is a nice bag for my large notebook. I love that it doesn't feel bulky. It has just the right amount of extra pockets for what you need.
3,"Targus 19"" Notebook case","My grandson just purchused a new 17"" notebook with money from his first ever job. He is 16 years old and he was thrilled to get this notebook case from us at Christmas, because he could not only carry his notebook, but there was plenty of room for extra gear and pockets for organizing needed storage."
4,"Excellent, but wish it had a zipper. + a few other things.","Overall I really like this bag. However, I would prefer the compartment that holds the laptop to be zippered. This would provide an added level of protection, and after all, that is why we purchase these bags. Second. The loops to put pens are very oddly placed. There all several pockets for chargers and cables and anything else you might need. There is space for my laptop, tablet (has its own felt-lined compartment), and even a few notebooks without being over-filled. If this bag just had a zipper for the laptop section it would get 5 stars. But... it doesn't so... 4 is all it gets."
5,Very Useful Bag,"I have used this model Targus bag for a couple years. It fits my Dell 1505 (15.4"") lap top very well. There is a lot of room for extras in the various compartments. I often have various books, cables, spare battery etc. in the bag along with the computer. I had previously used a briefcase style bag, but it only had room for the computer and maybe a spare battery and cable. The backpack style is a lot more useful and adaptable.Recently, my son was on a business trip to Europe. His luggage got sent to the wrong city, and he was limited pretty much to the clothes on his back. I thought how nice a computer bag like this Targus CityGear would have been for him so he could to take his computer plus business papers and some spare necessities. So, because I was so happy with mine, we bought this one for him for Christmas."
4,so far so good,We were pleased with the bag although we would have liked sturdier straps. So far we haven't had any problems. It's holding up well.
5,Great laptop case,"This is a great, usefull laptop case with lots of space and pockets and i am so happy with it."
4,It get the job done...,"This messenger holds my 17"" laptop and a couple magazines with no problem, very comfortable when wearing the shoulder strap althought the padding cant be adjusted (its sewed in place). Enough room on the front flap net pocket for some cables (USB, ethernet, firewire, etc) but it gets really uncomfortable if you try to also fit the charger or anything bulkier than that. Also the phone carring case has a velcro loop that wears off quickly (it got a bit lose after 2 weeks) but its useful if you want to use it as padded pouch for anything else (i just place my camera in it and toss it in my carry on bag) otherwise you will have to keep making sure you still have it attached. As I said, if you want a bag to carry your laptop and a couple cables or reading material around this is the bag for you but remember it doesnt take much to overload it."
5,Great bag,"Very nice laptop messenger bag. Lots of room inside and plenty of zippered pockets all over the bag for misc. items. Looks nice, too."
4,Doesn't look like one in the picture,"This case does the job, however it isn't the exact same as the one in the picture, it doesn't say ""Targus"" in yellow on it like the picture, on the strap or the side."
4,Great Sturdy and Solid Bag!,"I have a 17.3 Hp Laptop and it fits quite well, I would say buy this bag is you have a smaller computer. The compartments are very handy not only for computer accessories but also for all other miscellaneous items as well. This is worth the price. It is Very Sturdy and Solid. I'm glad I bought it. I did price this bag at a few store and it cost over 60 dollars. This is a very good deal."
3,Adequate is the word.,"As advertised, this messenger case has room (barely) for my 17"" notebook. But I need more space for textbooks, electric cord, my portable mouse, pen, and personal items. While it is true that most of my items fit into the bag, it is not without some damage to paperback textbooks and an imbalance to the stuffed bag. I suspect the problem is with having too high an expectation for the flexibility/expandability of the case. Regarding its construction, it has held up well as I have used it for a semester of college classes. That means it is fairly sturdy."
4,Great bag,"Holds a lot, has a comfortable strap, doesn’t have the small side pocket as shown but all in all not too bad"
4,Good bag for a great price,"The only problem I have with this bag is that the bottom is not as padded as I would like. Otherwise, the sides have plenty of padding, all the straps and clips feel strong and secure, and it has lots of well-placed pouches for holding accessories."
3,TCG200 17 CityGear review,The notebook case works; I have two complaints. (1) The AC Adapter barely fits in the one pocket. The other pocket wants to unzip. (2) The strap tends to come unsnapped.
5,This bag is awesome!!!! HUGE!,"This bag is so big, if you're looking for a bag with room and sturdiness this is it! I couldn't have asked for a better computer bag. I also ran into someone with an older version of this bag, they had owned it for a year, it was in really good shape; Moral: these bags are sturdy and last a long time. Very good quality."
4,Good Case For Reasonable Money,"Bought this case recently and quite happy with size, finish and functionality. There are probably better cases around, but not many for this money. Really recommend this for anyone on budget."
5,Nice bag with lots of crevices,"The bag was larger than I expected, but it has lots of pockets, nooks & crannies for poking stuff."
1,beware buying bag from JoLouisLimited LLC,"I bought this bag based on the product description and when I received it, it looked very nice but sadly my 16"" Toshiba would NOT fit. I emailed JoLouis Limited who said she would give a full refund including shipping costs. I sent the bag back and STILL have not received refund after a few months. So I have no bag and am out money. If your laptop is smaller than 16"" I'd say go with this bag but DO NOT get it from JoLouis Limited who will scam you out of money and a bag."
4,Great bag.,"Great bag, light and carries as much as I can lift. My only complaint is that the strap that slides over the handle on a rolling bag needs a more secure way to fasten it in the center between the two shafts of the rolling bag handle to prevent the computer bag from spinning around."
4,Targus Messenger Bag,"I needed a 17"" lap top only to discover how difficult it is to find a messenger style bag that will accomodate a lap top of that size. The Targus Messenger Notebook Bag does just that. It is large enough to hold my lap top,all necessary documents and other tech equipment. It is durable and does not hurt my shoulder and back which rates high on my list."
1,Didn't work,I poured the entire bottle on some carpet that had been urinated on. Followed the direction and even used a black light before and after. No difference. The urine was still in the carpet and the smell was still present
1,What a Gyp,"Too good to be true. Paid $26 for the stuff, and it hardly got out the odor, but my cat continues to pee in the same spot every chance he gets. Nothing short of replacing the carpet will get him to stop, and I can't- I rent. VERY disappointing!"
1,Worse Smell Than the Urine,"I followed the directions reviewers gave here to use the stuff liberally then cover with plastic, wait several days etc. Barely budged the urine but I refused to repeat since the smell of the product itself is worse. It is sickly sweet, smells like the vet and you can't get rid of it. Now you have the smell of perfume over the urine. Its been two weeks now, I have all the windows open in the room all day in the dead of winter and I can still smell the stuff. I would advise using a small bit of it in a room to see if you are OK with the smell before you spill a gallon of it on your carpets."
2,Good idea but it doesn't really work,"I bought this because my cat had peed on the carpet and the smell was nauseating. I literally drenched the area with the product, covered it in plastic and waited two days. After it dried the smell came back. I tried again (twice!) and I still haven't gotten rid of that smell. Replacing the carpet is not an option (I'm in a rental) and I'm at a loss as to what to do next.Also, I had a bit of trouble with the vendor I bought this from (Entirely Pets) so if you're going to try this product, choose a different vendor."
2,Urine Off,Seems to work for a time but then the urine odor is right back. I haven't found anything that really works but maybe later I'll have the carpet ripped up and hard wood floors put in. That should keep the cat from wanting to urinate in places she smells the odor. At least I hope so.
1,Does not work,i sprayed and sprayed till the cows come home and the odor still keeps coming back do not buy this
1,Do not buy Urine Off,"The cat formula Urine Off is terrible. First of all, it does not get rid of the smell of urine. Second, it leaves behind the smell of a urine soaked old lady's house who is using perfume to disguise the smell of her own filth. Third, it is damn near impossible to get rid of the smell of the Urine Off.Here's a tip - use plain, old fashioned white vinegar if your cat or dog pees on the carpet. Just spray it on, let it dry, clean the area the next day with some soapy water. Repeat if necessary. The vinegar neutralises the urine - works every time. I sincerely regret ever using Urine Off; should have just stuck to the vinegar.PS - the only reason I have given it a star is because it wouldn't let me not. Zero stars from me!"
5,IT REALLY WORKS!,"I used this on the cement floor when we took up the padding and carpet and neutralized the bare floor before putting down vinyl flooring. We followed the directions of cleaning the floor then spraying the cat urine areas 'til wet then covering with plastic drop cloths. We let it stand almost 48 hrs. and it took all odor away. We then rinsed the floor. I also used it on a very dense medium sized nylon carpet that I took outside to clean. I first high power sprayed it with the hose, then scrubbed it with detergent and a scrub brush on both sides, then rinsed it thoroughly with the hose. When it dried, it still stank. I then placed a shower curtain under it and poured URINE OFF on the affected areas, then wrapped the shower curtain around to cover the area & I anchored it in place, leaving it for 24 hrs. then hosed it off and when it dried it smelled fresh with no trace of urine odor. This produce really works and I will buy more in the future if/when I need more."
2,Did not meet expectations,"I bought this product in the hopes that it would remove the urine smell in our carpet from where our female cat has urinated many times, and to hopefully deter her from going again in that spot. I absolutely drenched the problem area with this stuff and covered it in plastic for days, let it dry, and then vacuumed with my wet vac (only hot water). Unfortunately, my cat urinated on the spot again. So, I did the procedure again, using more product and letting it ""work"" for an even longer period. I finished the process yesterday, and my cat hasn't gone there again, but the area still has an odor when the light hits it. Other than it not performing up to my expectations, the fragrance of the product is quite strong. So strong that my husband (who has asthma), couldn't be in the room for days because he had trouble breathing. Just a warning to anyone who is sensitive to smells and/or asthma."
2,It didn't work for me at all,"I took a chance and ordered due to the amount of positive reviews. But like many other products that claim to get rid of cat urine.. It didn't work for me. I have 5 indoor cats and one has been stressed lately and has urinated on the ceramic tile by the front door. I did try a simple method and with fingers crossed has done a 100% improvement over anything I have purchased. I mixed Baking soda and hydrogen peroxide into a paste. Spread it all over the area and allowed it to almost completely dry.. Then I used my shark steam mop and cleaned with with plain water... As of today its still odor free, and this was over 2 weeks ago.Hope this works for others... but I am done spending my hard earned money on products that do not work!"
3,Worked Better than other remedies,"Urine Off seems to have worked. I had to use it twice(which the directions states that might need to be done) and really douse the area, so the gallon size was beneficial."
3,Not as good as other reviewers have had.,"I had high hopes, but the cat urine stains and odor on my hardwood floor seem to be too much for this product. It also did nothing to deter the cats from returning. I have followed the directions and done 5 applications with no apparent effect. Oh well............."
2,not what I expected,"I have used other Propolis products before, and was disappointed with this one from YS ECO bee farms. The others in similar bottle came in liquid form. I could use the dropper to squirt out a small amount into a cup or mouth. This product came in sticky, semi-solid form. I could not use the dropper to squeeze out anything into a cup."
4,Knee Sleeve,This is ONLY a sleeve and doesn't have any padding. I only bought to keep my son's knee from getting scraped when skidding on the court. Do not get it if you're looking for padded protection!
3,Thick pads,"They were thicker and longer than I expected. There is no way you could run with these on. They seemed well constructed and would protect well, but not what I was looking for."
4,Super book,"This book is really focused towards those of us who still use film cameras, but still a great book non the less. The modern day digital user can use some the same ideas that is this book for digital."
5,Great stuff,"The tub price is far cheaper than buying individual packets at the store. We love this on pork chops. We found the recipe for 'peanut sauce' to be very nasty though. As an ingredient in the recipes found at the Taste of Thai web site, it's very handy."
2,Actually 2 and 1/2 stars,"I had high hopes for this product and will say that the packaging and cost are fine. However, the product inside the great reusable plastic containers is way too sweet. We used it on baked chicken, veggies, and as a sauce per the included recipe but the best way to mask the excessive sweetness is using it to make a spicy Thai peanut noodle salad. I add toasted sesame oil, hot chili oil, cilantro, ground peanuts and sometimes peanut butter and often bring it to potlucks. It is usually the first empty bowl.I will not purchase again."
1,Absolutely Useless,"If you want data and not information this is your book. Contains a minimal amount of information other than numerical ratings of Fishing, Float Times, Scenery, etc. Previous review must have been written by someone selling the book. Very Disappointing."
5,Cables that work,"Works as expected. I got these for an Avocent 2 port DVI KVM switch. Apparently, there are 2 DVI cable types - read up a bit on your KVM equipment first."
4,a must for female red sox fan,a wonderful pair of red sox earrings - great to wear to cheer on your team - great price and service
2,red soxs earrings,"Be careful of these. They show to be silver in color, but came through as yellow gold tone. Seller stateddifferent shipments come through in different finishes. His site should state that. Otherwise cheap dine store quality"
4,Yakusa or your life,"This (Coffee table Style Photo) Book documents various Characters from the ""Yakusa"" - The Japanese Mafia-style gangster community in their habitat of the Streets of Japan. Bruce Gilden has captured the kind of lifestyle these people lead in his gritty, at times disturbing (and sometimes quite bizarre) book. The photos tell a story in a single frame, and leave you with a different view of a Japan that we normally see as Hi-Tech and Prosperous. My only criticsm of the book would be, having met Bruce (at the book launch) it would have been good to include a few comments about the pictures from him, as he has a VERY dry and critical sense of humour. His Pictures convey so much truth and visual style, I think a few words would have been the icing on a very Bittersweet cake.A Beautifully bound, Well designed Photojournalistic Book."
3,Great novelty.,"Cute product. Great for photos, but baby doesn't take to it as well as standard pacifiers. Keeps spitting it out."
2,Poorly drawn characters; no discernible plot,"I found Qiu's first book, Death of a Red Heroine, fascinating and complex. This book meandered through what was basically a non-plot. The American police woman was so poorly drawn she could have said anything at anytime and it wouldn't have made a difference. Often she served simply as a question-asking device so that the reader could be given information about Chinese culture. And the clothes she wore... Yikes! No female American police officer would wear a white dress and high heels to interview suspects. Duh!Also, I didn't see how the poetry Chen writes and recites was relevant to the plot in anyway, nor could I get a true reading on his personality.Finally, the writing was amateurish in terms of plot and character development. I don't plan to read Qiu again, unless a new book receives really fabulous reviews."
3,Poetic License,"This is a thinly plotted mystery that partially redeems itself with a nuanced evocation of modern day Shanghai. It should be sub-titled 'An Anthology of Chinese Verse' because scarcely a page goes by without some couplet appearing. But these interesting trappings cannot sustain a mystery that fails to be very, well, mysterious. Most of the novel centers on a race between the police and several gangs to locate a woman. The resolution to this race occurs in one sentence and will leave you asking - Did I miss something? It's a microcosm for the novel as whole... great setting, rich characters, nice writing... but no mystery."
1,No Win XP information,I can not use this device on my laptop that runs on windows XP. The problem is that there is no way to know this in advance or to contact the manufacturer to upgrade the software.
3,"Try ""Poems and Insults"" instead","This has some great moments but the poems are weaker than ""P&I"" and the ""rejoinders"" with the audience keep derailing things. Maybe you had to be there. Interesting but not essential."
5,the bomb,only thing better than reading the Buke is listeningto him.I get so much more life out of his works whenI hear him speak. dano.
3,Good Clean Western,"I have to say this book is good because it is a goodclean read which is truly an accomplishment for a western story-line. However, I do not recommend it if you are looking for a fast moving cliffhanger. It reminds me a little of the ole-style country/western songs...it has a tendency to drag on. Sorry Mr. Brouwer, the first book in this series, 'Evening Star' drew me in but this one fizzled out. Do not give up on S. Bouwerthough - he is a great writer...maybe just not westerns?"
2,"Pretentious, Pedantic, Obscure","If you are looking for a dry, obscure, pedantic monograph that uses cryptic hieroglyphics to describe algorithms, well, friend, this text is for you! On the other hand, if you are looking for a practical text that can be read by non-Math majors, move on. THERE IS ZERO USEABLE MATERIAL that I was able to glean from the book, and I've been programming commercial search engines and parsers for 9 years.I have no doubt that the author knows what he's talking about, but the information is, for all practical purposes, encrypted and I don't have the keys.And the quotes from dead Romans and literary figures that are on most pages are just pretentious, distracting, and annoying.I'd love to get my money back."
5,Tasty!!!!!,"These are sooo good! They remind me of a 100 Grand candy bar, but with a little bit of a healthy kick to it. It's still not something to eat every day, but when I have a chocolate craving I can eat one of these and not feel too guilty in the morning!"
4,a voice teacher and early music fan,"PLENTY OF DEVOTION, BUT NOT MUCH EMOTION!Jochen Kowalski is a German countertenor, much sought after internationally. His voice is sonorous, flexible and clear. However, both singer and the Philharmonic Art Ensemble left me feeling rather bereft and unmoved by it all.The selections were well-chosen (all in German-no translations); some were familiar such as ""O Holy Night""- 'Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming'-'Adeste Fidelis'- 'In Dulci Jubilo' etc. Kowalski seemed to try at times to 'stir things up' a bit, but the Orchestra did not respond.However, the recording is not poorly done for Kowalski has a truly lovely-sounding voice, so I cannot say that I derived nothing from it. I think I just expected more because of other albums I have with him, such as the German Opera Record, which is absolutely fabulous!It would have been nice if 'Capriccio' had at least translated some of the German unfamiliar songs. I spent half the time looking up words in my German dictionary!!!!"
1,Irratating,I bought this collection hoping for some great music. I'm really into home movies and I like to use these tracks as background music. Well this compilation is very disappointing. Don't be fooled by the name of the band that plays: its really more like a couple of guys working some keyboards. I've heard more realistic music from my MIDI system.
3,Brilliant but Outdated,"First off I'll say that I love Franzen's writing style and his dry sense of humor. The problem I had with this book is that because most of the essays were written in the mid to late 90s and all were written before 9/11, much of his observations have been rendered, in my opinion, obsolete. The world became a different place after 9/11 and the start of the war, etc. - and his observations on the zeitgeist, obviously, don't reflect that change."
3,"Pithy, but dated.","Franzen is always entertaining and these essays provide insights into his youthful anger and angst. However, I found myself wanting to move on too often because the essays seemed too dated. Enjoyable, but not a must read in my opinion"
2,Misleading,"This is largely (to me) a disappointing collection of essays written in the 1990's and early 2000's. I suppose some of it has to do with the theme the collection's title suggests, but not (so far as I could see) all of it: The history of the tobacco industry; the nature of cities; mail inefficiencies in Chicago. I'm afraid I missed the connection.At its best, the collection described why people read and write--and those parts were enjoyable, and seemed filled with insight, the way thoughts often do when they coincide with your own point of view.I feel slightly cheated by having bought a book whose title promised more than its contents delivered."
5,A neat read,"This collection of essays offers a glimpse into the personal thoughts and innerworkings of Franzen's mind. His prose is more relaxed and interesting than in his novels, which is really refreshing to read."
5,Great book!,"Cheaper than at my college bookstore, but it definitely helps transition from Java to C, which is obviously vital in programming. All those differences are explained here and why. Even the structure of the languages is different, Java is much nicer for programming, just less efficient. Worth Buying!!"
2,Windows 98/XP only!,"Don't get one if you are running Windows 7. It works great with 98 and XP, but plug it into a Windows 7 machine and it installs drivers and then tells you that it did not install properly. Won't work."
4,handy cases give HD's a new life,"these cases are really easy to use, inexpensive and a great way to get rid of an old computer: pull its harddrive and archive in one of these.the downside is they are abit bulky...but less than an old CPU!"
5,Great alternative to an internal hard drive,"I bought this product to store extra media files and was not disappointed. The installation was as easy as installing an internal drive, and using the included instructions, I was able to format and use the drive immediately. Not only does this kit free up space and resources inside your computer, it is portable, and it can be turned off and on without restarting the computer. Also, it is very quiet, I often cannot hear it over the sound of my computer. Best of all, you can put any size hard drive or even a cdrom drive in it, and unlike other external hard drives, you can easily swap your hard drive for a bigger one at a later time. This is a great product, and I will soon buy another one!"
5,Up and running in 30 minutes,"First of all, let me say that I am a moderate techie, but hard drives (ie jumper settings, master/slave setups, BIOS settings) always intimidate me. Hav eyou ever read the installation directions that come with a hard drive? I bought this hoping that it would be a simple plug and play and thats just what it turned out to be. Exactly what it said it was. The instructions were clear and simple, with a few pictures for good measure and I was up and running in 30 minutes. The uses for this are more than I can list here. I am very happy so far"
1,Another garbage book,"This text has to be among the worst math books I have ever encountered. The content in the chapters is very vauge and I'd hazard to guess makes sense only to those who already know linear algebra. This book may perhaps be a good refresher book, but as a beginning text it fails miserably. The examples as others have said are not helpful at all nor are the solutions found in the back of the book. Overall, this book is a waste of bookshelf space. Get Anton's book instead and save yourself the trouble."
2,"Concise, but does not explain things clearly","This textbook was used for the 1st year algebra course that I took and it gave me a pretty rough time. It's nice because it covers a lot of topics, but it has one weakness: the explanations are very poorly written, and from a student's perspective, they are very difficult to understand. All explanations of the various subjects are accurate, but they seem to be written from a viewpoint which seems to be geared towards not students but those who have already understood the material. Most of my friends taking the same course also felt that this textbook was extremely lacking. Please, if you're a professor, do your students a favour and choose a different algebra textbook than this one!!!"
3,OK Reference Book,"An ok reference book for linear algebra (I only used it too look up quick formulas and methods), but doesn't have much theory about the topics."
2,Don't buy this book,"This book was terrible; I have never been so confused by a book as I have with this one. As a student, it was very hard to learn from, but now that I know the material, it's a good reference."
5,Sturdy Ring,"This ring is very solid and sturdy, not cheap and bendable. I have worn it while washing dishes, cleaning the house, all types of activities and it is in great shape. I don't like the fake silver metal rings because they turn green and irritate my skin, this one is not that way! I recommend it if you want a unique, attractive, sturdy ring."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"THIS IS ONLY A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF WINDOWS WITH JAVA. IF YOU DO NOT KNOW JAVA, YOU WILL BE IN TROUBLE. I WOULD LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR A BOOK DEALING WITH WFC."
5,a must-have for healthcare students,"This book is useful for both students and clinical providers (my preceptors borrow my copy quite frequently). Your school will probably NOT tell you about it, because they want you to scour many books just to find the information that's included on one page of this reference! I'm in my 2nd year of an adult and womens health nurse-practitioner program, and wish I would have come across all these books a year ago. Very thorough yet concise information. THANKS to these authors for providing such a useful reference!"
3,It's okay; nothing special but not horrible,"It's a good quick reference if you're trying to jog your memory. Each chief complain takes up two pages. One page has the Hx and PE stuff you want to do, and the second page has all the possible differentials. There's no explanation for any differential...that could be good or bad depending on the user of the book."
2,Not So Funny When You Read It,"Unfortunately, _Not So Funny_ is really not that humorous. Given the contributing authors (including Dave Barry, Douglas Adams, Anne Lamott, and, of course, Tim Cahill) one would expect this collection to have you rolling in the aisles. But it simply doesn't work. The snippets may have fit very well in their original publications, but the misadventures in _Not So Funny_ are just not surprising or amusing enough as stand-alones.I read this book while on an extremely long flight to South Africa. As such, it was bearable, but the stories shared by my co-passengers were considerably more appealing. Stick to Cahill's earlier works and avoid this haphazard assortment."
3,"ok, but not a must-read, even for Cahill fans","Normally, I devour almost anything Cahill associates himself with, and that's why I bought _Not So Funny_. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't really that great a value.Reviewer Ivy, below, summed up my sentiments pretty well with some really well-penned observations. While most of the big adventure travel names are here, most of the really interesting stories seem to have already shown up someplace else. Most of these are pretty short, so I suppose it'd be good before-bed or throne room reading, but I just didn't find most of them compelling.If you don't have elevated expectations brought on by reading a lot of Cahill's stuff (as I do), you may enjoy it more than I did."
5,Glad I Wasn't There,"What a wonderful collection of truly amusing stories!! After reading "" The Dentist in Cameroon"" I wanted to cancel my own dentist appointment!! ""What I Did in the Dollhouse"" was over the top and so colorfully written that I almost wet myself!! Travelers' Tales has done it again by providing a rich assortment of humor and misadventures from around the globe."
2,disappointing on several levels,"The stories are OK, but OK is not really very good--especially considering the high hopes that I had based on the quite good idea that the book is. Frankly, I overstate the matter when I say that the stories are OK. Not only did I not read them all--I could not. Pages 35-82 were left out of my book! OK, so I got two copies of pages 83-130. That is little consolation. Be sure to check your book, but these errors tend to be isolated. I am sorry to have to be so negative. I have not been this disappointed in a long time. Frankly, I have low standards! I am easily amused, but this anthology disappointed."
3,"Not So Great, But...","The content was too fragmented and uneven; it should have ""flowed"" a bit better. I felt as a reader (and writer), I was being jerked from one story to another. Some did make me laugh, however."
4,Great Read!,"Chief Chalker has a hit with his second Home Team book. The action is fast paced and almost non-stop. The concept of Al Queda terrorists working with drug smugglers is all too real.My only criticism is the detailed descriptions of the Team's load out for every excursion. It's interesting to hear once, but we don't need to know which socks he's wearing with which tactical holster.I have to complain about such minute details because that's all that's wrong with the book.If you like Andy McNabb, Marcinko, or Brad Thor, add Chief Chalker to your list of ""must reads"""
4,Fantastic action/adventure romp!,"The 2nd novel in the Home Team series was another great, fast-paced adventure read. Like the first novel, Undeclared War, authors Dennis Chalker and Kevin Dockery give us another hardcore action read that drives ever forward like a fully-armed locomotive.With realistic details and an all-too-real terrorist plot, Hostile Borders entertains you till the climatic, action-filled end. Ted Reaper is a hero of today's headlines.I'm glad to have found such a fun and exciting new series. I can't wait for the next new novel coming out in February.Hollywood, look no further for your new action major motion picture!!"
1,The pictured pump is correct but supplier subsituted another. Box opened with smaller pump sent??,Wrong pump was recieved. The order and box description are correct but box was opened and a smaller less powerful pump sent?? We can't keep the water hot. Need some help on this! JGM
3,Never brought this.......,"I was going to purchase this book and I realized the dated reviews, I purchased the updated version Unix in 24hrs....."
3,Want to clarify something...,"Well, the music is lame, I agree. The previous reviewer sounds like a China-hater. I just want to clarify that Wind Records is a Taiwanese company, not a Chinese one. Well, you can argue that many musicians on this record are Chinese and therefore the music is not authentic. But, aren't musicians everywhere doing similar things for a long time? On the positive side, it's a form of cultural exchange. BTW, my political stand is: I hate the Chinese government. But I like Chinse people in most cases."
1,Not Tibetan music,"I'm glad amazon provided sound clips for this; my dad bought it in a CD store without the opportunity to listen to it ... and without going into the political situation of Tibet and China which you must make up your own mind about, suffice it to say:This is not Tibetan music. It is Chinese music.I'd respectfully recommend you don't give these people your money."
4,Thank God,"I'm not sure how these particular songs came to be chosen for this CD. The Billboard CD series supposedly features the highest charting songs, based on the Billboard music charts. Well, most of the songs on this particular CD didn't make the Billboard charts at all! Only the Billy Squire, Beach Boys, Canned Heat and Cheech & Chong tracks actually charted. They really should have included Bruce Springsteen's ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" and John Lennon's ""Happy Xmas (War is Over)"", but they probably were unable to license those particular songs. But to be fair, Billboard didn't have Christmas charts every year, so many of the songs here probably would have charted if Billboard published Christmas charts during the years the songs came out. Regardless of all that, this is a good collection of rock and roll Christmas songs. Not perfect, by any means, but still a solid collection."
4,Short but good collection of holiday rarities,"I almost forgot I have this CD. It's a little short on substance, only 10 songs, but about half of them are rare and hard to find, those being:Thank God It's Christmas - QueenAll I Want For Christmas is You - FoghatChristmas at Ground Zero - Weird Al YankovicChristmas Blues - Canned HeatSanta Claus & His Old Lady - Cheech & ChongThe Weird Al song sounds like something on a Bob Rivers or Dr. Demento album. I like the Queen song as well. The others not mentioned above are pretty much standards, The Beach Boys, the Dave Edmunds Band, etc. It's a nice selection, but they could have added a few more songs to it. It could be a Top 12 or even a Top 15 collection.I've gotta find this CD which is somewhere in my house. One other thing, when you play the last song by Cheech & Chong, make sure there aren't any little kids around."
2,I regret buying this but a few songs were good.,I shouldn't have bought this because I dont' even listen to it anymore. I bought it cuz Queen was on it and other good songs but that was it. Most of the songs weren't really great.
2,Limited Usefulness,"This CD has limited usefulness for a serious Bible student. The 5 translations are, King James, New King James, Darby's New Translation, American Standard Version (1901), and Youngs Literal Translation. The only concordance is Strongs.Matthew Henery's Concise Commentary is nice. The other is Adam Clarke's Commentary.For this low price it may be to much to expect either the New International VVersion or teh New American Standard translations."
4,"Good insights, slow read","STory of how life really was for the pioneers who traveled west. The desert struggles go on and on. Good information on how different life was then to now. Manly was a real man, with honesty, morals, courage. Good Read but slow to get through at times."
2,Small Ideas for Small Spaces,"The book is beautifully presented, fun to look at, and sometimes interesting to read. I didn't want a coffee-table book! I wanted ideas for my small townhouse, and I found the ideas and suggestions uninspiring and impractical. The ideas would be useful if I lived by myself, and could decorate my home in the gallery-like fashion of the homes in the book. Well, happily, I don't live alone. I have a family, and two cats, and life isn't simple, or uncluttered. A beautiful home is important to me, but not at the cost this book offers. I'll continue my search for practical suggestions to help me accommodate our lives, possessions, and needs."
4,Good poll sci/theory text,"I thought this text was good. I was worried, at first, that a textbook like this (and the class to match it) would be very biased, as anything political seems to be. I think the author did his best to keep it neutral. It's a very informative book, and very easy to read. The thing I disliked about it, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that sometimes it feels like it's not in depth enough. Even if it's written as an overview of the various ideologies, it could still explore them a little further, and give more information about how these ideologies interact with one another.Even if you're not in a course, this would be a good choice of books to learn about the political spectrum. It's also very reasonably priced, for a textbook."
2,too strange,I bought this book because I like Medieval History and I wanted some more ideas of what feelings were like at the turn of the last Milennium. There are several good books out there on the subject. Though I would still put this book on the list I would put it at the bottom. I was looking for history and got 90% surrealism. If that's what you're looking for then fine. If you're looking for a good history or historical fiction then look elsewhere.
3,Cosmo gets his shots off,"Preistly puts down the smackdown with his gun. he stars as Cosmo and then he becomes a hitman with Peter Reigert. Preistly is too starightfoward with his character, he plays him so wooden and that sorta kills it off but then the good ending where he pops Loggia and then confronts his wanting to get back together with Kimberly Williams. funny part is when Josh Charles comes to Williams house mad demanding her, then Preistly decks him in the face with his gun, nice. Janeane Garafolo plays a prostitute. Michael J. Fox appears as well(Preistly kills him off though)."
4,HITMAN HUMOR,Hilarious......dark comedy filled with irony. Has an independant film feel - great acting - great cast. Get it !!!DrFeelgood
4,A PLEASANT AND ENJOYABLE SURPRISE!,"First off, I was bored on a Saturday night and desperate to see a movie, so I saw ""Cold Blooded"" on the shelf, with Jason Priestly's face on the cover and started laughing....I said, Priestly a hit man?....Well, this movie was an excellent piece of film. Priestly was so unpredictable as a hit man named Cosmo who falls in love with a Yoga Instructor played by Kimberly Williams (Father of the Bride), so decides he wants to get out of the Mafia business.Honestly this movie is a must see....A little garish with the blood, but one of the best dark comedies I have seen in a long time.Unfortunately, AND I DO NOT KNOW WHY! this movie went straight to video. With word of mouth this movie could of definitely been a box office hit.I wonder what studios are thinking sometimes...They release Priestlys ""Calendar Girl"", but put ""Cold Blooded"" on the shelf?Also cameos by Michael J. Fox and Robert Loggia.Honestly a pleasant surprise!"
5,Superb.,"allright first off, this is easily the funniest, and greatest mob related comedy, mafia! was pathetic, this is about cosmo, a low level bookie, who get's a chance to become something higher in the underworld, a hitman, he stars making big bucks, but the coolest thing to me about this movie is it's style. hawaiin shirts,cadillacs, silenced .45's,a beautifull actress who cosmo falls in love with, I cannot recomend this movie more, yes it is from the producers who did dumb and dumber, but this is incredible, jason priestley does not get enough respect in the business, see this, or miss out. also it's a Dark Comedy, So Enjoy. well acted, Great Story,Once more ""SEE IT""~ The Saint."
2,"possibly unhealthy, sounds weak, won't last long","I don't use earbuds much, so store these away most of the time. Imagine my surprise, when I needed earbuds during Hurricane Ike for my radio, and found the foam on these had corroded. Can you imagine the foam in your ear canal?Didn't sound that good to begin with."
2,Very Uncomfortable,I did not like the foam pad that attached to the earbud it fell of many times and was very uncomfortable. The sound was decent but you can by a better headphone ...
1,Foam cushions disintegrated,"I pulled these out after having been in the drawer only to find that the ear cushions had disintegrated. Not just the ones on the ear pieces, but the replacement ones as well.I suspect the reason they were in the drawer for a while was because like other reviewers, I didn't find them all that good or comfortable."
2,Below average earbuds,"These earbuds are not that good.1) The comfortability of these were kinda painful. I have to shove them up my ear to get any sound.2) The sound quality isn't that good. The bass is only ok, and sounds bloated at times. The treble seems to high-pitched for some reason.3) The earbuds are not very durable. The left side broke within one week.4) The cost for these are very expensive for the quality you get.Overall, I've had Jensen products in the past. I honestly have to say, Jensen is not a very good company for headphones. The JM10, JB6, JM25, and others have flaws, and only ok sound. I would only recommend Jensen for cost, since they have such a low price for everything they sell. But, I guess the reason they are so inexpensive because the quality is lacking."
4,You DON'T Have To Be A Kid To Enjoy This,"I've occasionally put together my own homemade Halloween party tapes-and believe me I have 'borrowed' a few tunes from this particular collection. Since I own this on tape, I must say that on Side 1 the only songs I'm not crazy about are A Nightmare On My Street as well as The Haunted House Of Rock. Except for those 2 songs, the rest of this collection is top-notch stuff. Great fun for any Halloween party. I also recommend these Halloween albums: Ghastly Grooves(Sony Special Products); Billboard Presents Family Scarytime Classics(Rhino) plus Halloween Hits(Rhino). Very enjoyable. TRICK OR TREAT!"
1,THAT'S IT ? NINE LOUSY SONGS?,"Well not all the songs are lousy, but the amount IS. Dr Demento has played tons and tons of great Halloween songs on his radio show over the years, and this is the best they can come up with? What about songs like Spooky Skeleton Dance. The song by Louis Armstrong where he says ""Don't go in dare, dat house is hanted"" Jumpin Gene Simmons' (not the KISS guy) Haunted House. Halloween by Elvira. What Ever Happened To Eddie by Butch Patrick. John Zacherley's Dinner With Drac or a few of his many others or Bobby Pickett's stuff including Monster Rap. songs like that and so many more. So many new novelty artists owe their career to Dr Demento and so many old artists and their record labels owe their resurgence to him. So far Halloween Hootenanny and These Ghoulish Things are the best Halloween Cds I've found, but their not good enough. I'm still looking for that one biggest and best collection worthy of 5 stars. And this certainly isn't it."
5,The Best JS book I've seen!! And I've seen a few.,This book teaches the way it supposed to be done. First it gives you information explaining the element(s) you will be learning. Second it gives you examples of what was just explained. Third it has you do some practice exercises of your own. Fourth it uses a building block style of learning so that the new things you learn are added to the old for reinforcement. The book says you can learn it in a week which for most is probably not true but you will learn it and no language I have ever learned (became proficient at) was learned in a week anyway. Not even HTML. It may move a bit fast for a beginner but it is very thorough and you will learn. Also it is still very relative today even though JS 1.2 is the latest standard. This book will give you the basics and get you to the point where you can teach yourself without a book. Very well done Arman!
3,Not a very good book.,"Especially, not good for ""a week"" study, as its title claims. OO concepts are not clearly explained, and examples are not much helpful"
2,Not recommended for beginners,"If you know nothing about javascript, it will be more like 'teach yourself in 6 months', as there is an assumption that you have previous object programming experience. Although well designed and well written, this book really misses the mark for beginners and, at least for myself, was disappointing."
5,Great book and samples.,Arman Danesh was a smart man to be able to write a book compiled so well.I really liked the samples from the web that he showed. He seems like a cool guy.
4,Good book.,"I found this book highly informative. Good examples, clear explanations. It is suitable for both tutorial and reference. If you're looking for a JavaScript tutorial, this book might be the best choice for you."
2,Title Misleading/For Experienced/Semi-Experienced Programmer,"This book is very misleading. It clearly says that there is no / little programming knowledge needed. This is in every respect not true. Danesh goes on teaching you the code of JS, but he does not explain thouroughly what each object. Also the title being Teach Youself... ...in a Week is very misleading because it took me 2 weeks just to get to the second chapter, and i finished Web publishing with HTML 3.2 in a week in on day. So it is not just me! I give this book a 4 because there are many other books <b>far</b> worse than this! It does teach you the <strong>basics</strong> though"
4,Well researched and presented.,"This book presents an excellent look at the extent to which faith played a role in the lives, beliefs and actions of eleven of our founding fathers. The author appears to have no preconceived notions concerning the faith of these men, nor does he attempt to persuade the reader that any religion or single faith was necessary at all. Indeed, the title speaks for itself in that it is ""Faiths"" plural. The beliefs of these men varied widely as did the extent to which they exercised their faiths. Having read numerous, lengthy biographies of our founding fathers, I found this book to be factually consistent with what others have researched and written -- and best of all it is set forth in a concise, easy to read manner that permits the reader to consider the evidence and reach his or her own decision concerning the founders faiths and how, if at all, their faiths influenced the founding of our nation."
5,Intense,"The best of old school positive hardcore. These guys popped up around the same time as Bane, and both bands are great. Ten Yard Fight is a rather tongue-in-cheek band; they're not too serious but they mean what they say. VERY good hardcore. You won't regret this. Fast, furious, anthemic."
1,Super Strong ??,"I have been buying many different types of these magnets since discovering them recently and was very disappointed in these. I can not believe these are advertised as Super Strong. I guess technically, ounce for ounce, they might be. But they have the smallest magnet I have ever seen in my life inserted in these plastic casings. The magnets can hardly carry the weight. One more thing about these, the magnets come out of the plastic housing pretty easily with much use. Looks like they just pressed them in instead of gluing them in. Only thing good about these is that you might consider them pretty!"
1,cute but not very strong,"I agree with one of the other reviewers -- these magnets are cute but not ""super"" strong. To be fair, one tiny magnet will hold up two or three pieces of paper, but they were not nearly as strong as I was expecting, more like regular fridge magnets."
3,"Decent, but not as big as they look...","I wouldn't go so far as to call them 'super strong'. For their size, they're decent but that's the problem. They're not as big as I thought they would be. About half the width of a penny. I uploaded a pic, take a look for yourself. All in all, not a bad deal if you realize their size and you're ok with that."
5,sous titres,"J'ai cherchée les sous titres francais par tout et il n'y a vraiment pas. Mais j'ai vu cette film en langue slovaque (je suis tchéque - c'est très proche la langue) et je comprends, ce qu'est dit.Je trouve cette film très bon et donc je prends ce manque subtitles comme un inniciative à prendre. Donc si quelqu'un aime cette film aussi et voulait coopérer, je suis capable faire la traduction de langue slovaque à langue francais ( - mais je besoin de quelqu'un qui peut corriger mon francais) et on peut faire les subtitles.Si quelqu'un est d'accorde, écris-moi sur mon mail: nocnisova@seznam.czLucie"
2,Amor Vincit Foeminam,"Gender Genocide is an extremely bad book that suggests all uppity women need is enough exposure to the holy phallus, and they will immediately be converted to their proper place of penis worship and complete submission.It is also screamingly funny from a modern perspective. What else can you do with a passage like the following except to laugh at how absurd it is? Here, Rura is taught what it means to be a woman, and, as mark of her conversion, experiences a kind of baptism by semen:""It was not like the rape of the previous day. It was not like lying with women. It was not like anything she had ever known.It was warm, it was disturbing, it was exciting, it was humiliating, it was proud . . . .A man - this man by her side - had washed away twenty years of conditioning. He had loved her, and . . . semen pulsed excruciatingly, wonderfully, through her vagina.""Utterly horrible; utterly hysterical."
3,Fits my demand!,I was looking for a heart monitor watch and this one doesn't have this function! But for amateur runners like me it's perfect! It has chrono function and stores laps data! It just fits my demand!!! When I become a frequent runner I'll go for the heart monitor!
1,"Horrible, cheap, not worth the price!","This was given to me as a Christmas gift, and I would never wish something so cheap on anyone. It's quality is terrible, it only picks up some radio stations, even following the instructions, 5 different adults couldn't get the thing to change the time or even set the alarm. It's very quiet and eats battery power. Don't waste your money!! Something from the dollar store is better than this. I threw mine away cause it wasn't worth the hassle of replacing it."
3,Makes you think outside the box,Opens your eyes to other opportunities. Makes you think outside the box and allows you to open your mind to your strengths.
5,what it does best,"This book helped me put a Name Tag on my life's calling.I also found out how often I am able to use it in my job (only 10% of the time).Now I need to know what jobs I could get that would maximize my use of my gifts - so I will never have to 'work' another day.There are 52 transcendant calling cards from which everyone can pick their gifts. There were not enough examples of how people use their callings appropriately. I would have at least wanted to see a list to match jobs to calling cards.I highly recommend this book. I've been trying to figure out what I wanted to be when I grew up for a long time. Now I finally am able to put a name to it.I got the book from the library, I wouldn't recommend buying it."
3,I cannot compute the greatness of this tome,"In my long career in computational science, I have often tried to calculate how many licks it takes to get the center of a tootsie pop. Turns out, it's 0 - if you stick the thing into a blender and hit ""frappe"""
2,Not a good introduction book,"I do not think it is a good introduction book. The authors should have used more figures to illustrate the concepts. Also, I do not like the norrow margins of this book. I like to write comments and my understanding in the books. There is simply no place to write!"
2,"Looks Cool, But Poor Quality","We bought 3 of these for the bar in our new house. They look cool and get lots of comments. For that they get a few stars. The problem is, after about 3 months, one of them lost its ability to keep its height. I'd sit on it (185 lbs), and 2 minutes later my chin is resting on the bar. A few months more go buy, and a second one goes bad. Also, theres a plastic ring underneith the foot of the stool, which wore off quickly as the stools are slid around on some textured tile. I'm disappointed because I'd like something that lasts, and looks good at the same time."
1,A Book On Lion Training Would Have Helped Better,"I read this book before I spent one horrible, frustrating year substitute teaching. Not helpful; I believe this book assumes that everyone will teach in a school where kids are well-behaved most of the time and school administrations will acknowledge the subs whom they need desperately."
5,Excellent Read,Very helpful. Glad I bought the book. I found some useful tips and tried it in the classroom. It has worked well for me. I also learned some information about ESE that I wouldn't have learned through substituting alone. It would help to know some of the disability to be able to understand your students. It'll help you how to work with different students.
1,Pretty bad,"Got some of these, returned them immediately. The fit wasn't too bad, the drivers pushed against my ears pretty well, but the sound was horrible, tinny, no bass. Just keep shopping."
3,Alright...But,"I owned a pair of these earphones for a couple of years until they finally broke and I really enjoyed them. However, I bought another pair to replace the broken ones and they broke a little over a year later. One user is right they do not have a lot of bass however I did enjoy having the volume control in the middle. Overall decent, but I'm not going to purchase another set after breaking in a year! Good Luck!"
4,A brief history of jury nullification.,"Judicial history student Lehman has compiled twelve cases from England and the U.S. in which jurors have taken it upon themselves, as a matter of conscience, to nullify or overturn horrific laws that endangered our freedoms. The book shows how the concept of jury nullification has been used to protect freedom of assembly, further voting rights, etc. A good case study history of juty nullification."
5,Best big band I've heard since Basie!,I've been a fan of Greg's since his days with Basie. This album swings harder than anything I've heard in quite some time. He is truly a master of the genre. 5 stars. Highly recomended!
5,Who are these guys?,"I can't stop playing this CD. This CD is for anyone who after all these years has missed their Basie ""fix"". I have over 60 Basie CDs and probably a half dozen Basie ""wantabe"" CDs. But who are these guys? This is the only Gregg Field CD in the entire... stockpile.Yes, I know Gregg Field played drums for Basie in the later years. Yes, I know the great Snooky Young and I am familiar with most of the Nestico charts on this CD, but this outfit sounds more like Basie than Basie did in the late 70s and early 80s. What a great sound! They sound like they have been playing as an ensemble for years.And the solos on this CD blow my mind. I close my eyes and I hear Frank Wess, Frank Foster, Joe Newman, Al Grey, Thad and the rest. The skimpy CD credits list guys like Ron Stout (trumpet), Sal Lozano (flute/alto), Pete Christlieb (tenor)and a Pete Jolly (piano). Who are these people? I want more."
2,Painfully Dull,"The book is it is not well written and is slow to develop - so despite it's small size it seemed to take forever to read. I've read several Warhammer novels and this one was, by far, my least favorite."
2,Weak at best,"This is my first Warhammer book, so I am not famaliar with the world or the agenda followed. However with a title of Necromancer and what was said on the rear cover I expected a little more. This is the sort of book you put out after you have introduced a successful character and people want to know more about the past of said character.I do not like the novels that good always wins and heroes constantly overcome massive odds. I was hoping for something dark and 'realistic' in a fantasy work. Maybe the character should of died before the end of the book, or maybe we could of had a legion of undead at his command.I hope the next book I read by Mr Green is much better."
5,Great Value..,"I bought this CD used for a very good price. It looked brand new and sounds great. it has all War's biggest hit, except ""Th World is a Getto.."
5,Wonderful!,"I received this for Christmas when it first came out and this set instantly made me a huge fan! I am not so keen on the '92 version by the Hispanic MCs, but the rest of this set, which includes an impressive booklet with eye-catching photos, is a great way to start collecting on this groups music!"
5,Funky And Ambitous,"The War Anthology is a funky adventure. It is the best of the best. You get all of their hits from Spill The Wine to Peace Sign. This is a very great package for all ages. The booklet was very informative and I think you should read it while your'e listening to the music. It also has one of my personal favorites, Dont Let No One Get You Down. Focus on this collection.... So enjoy this music!!!"
4,Must have for War purists.,"This album is typical of most greatest hits collections. Not really the greatest hits. Also, several songs have been shortened in order to squeeze them onto this collection (Gypsy Man; City Country,City; etc.). Still, if you love War, it is worth adding to your collection."
2,Whu not sing in key?,"You do not need a scope to detect that Acuna is not in tune. Sometimes she sounds as if she is in a different key altogether. How in the world can a producer pass this off on the public? Is it because the Latin fad is big now, and the recording company will accept any voice from South America?"
2,Tin Ears,"It is good that half of the listeners to this album have tin ears.Claudia mumbles the lyrics,sings many of them slightly off key,nd has trouble with the language. She sounds as if she is mouthing the words phonetically. Listen closely to Prelude and to What'll I Do."
4,"Good stuff overall, she's got my vote","Ok, so English is not her first language. I still dig her style, and I think she makes up for the linguistic shortcomings in her spirit and purity of voice.One of the better albums I've bought this year, and one certainly worth buying.To be honest I wish she'd do a Spanish-only Jazz Cd. Can't understand half of what she's saying, but DAG NAB it sure sounds good!Claudia really does have a great voice, and I will be looking forward to new material from her."
4,allround singer,"I have listened to this cd with great plesure, this lady has a wonderfull sound.Also the arrangements from the tunes are great. The only thing that she really has to work on is her timing, for example in prelude to a kiss,in this tempo she should have taken the chance to phrase it much more relaxed than she's doing now, she is phrasing to stiff.She has more pop phrasing than jazz phrasing.The arrangements and the sound of her voice makes this cd verry personal."
3,Kind of grows on you,"Inspite of the insipid review posted here stating that this singer has a Pitch problem (with a capital ""p"") I would say that the main problem with the album is the fact that the songs are arranged erratically and the selections are ill-conceived. I think that this album will definitely grow on you as you get the chance to listen to some, not all, of the songs and appreciate them individually. If you give yourself a chance you may come to like it, but you have to buy it first. Don't count on small samplings or advise from others."
1,Not worth the price,"Rechargeable batteries can get a bit pricey, so I was poking around for a cheap set when I found these. I've purchased other budget brands of rechargeable before (i.e. Ziekos and Targus), and even though those brands don't hold a charge for as long as a normal battery, these Digital Concepts batteries are horrible. I have repeatedly tried to charge them, and they lose their charge within a day. They are pretty much worthless. It hasn't even been two weeks and I'm already looking for new ones, because these won't hold a charge long enough for me to even use them. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,an interesting book,I enjoyed this book and find her to be a good actress and learning more about her was very interesting.
5,A must have. There is simply nothing like it.,"The two songs on this are some of Mingus' most intricate and complex compositions. The title track comes at you like a mack truck, using heavy rhythmic patterns, mixing minor and major keys, incorporating bassoons and piccolo flutes, and pounding a 5 note bass line. It continues to journey through many moods, all the while using amazing horn lines. Both tracks are pure compositional genius, rich in texture, sophisticated in melody and harmony, and overall amazing to listen to. Enjoy"
3,This is not the special edition in MONO,I've just bought this one because it was supposed to have the stereo and mono mixes as it said in the Amazon review but it isn't. Later they changed the website and the reviews notes at the end that it refers to de vinyl copy.Be careful with the reviews guys!!
3,Monkees cookie cutter debut,"Granted,this is the very pop music machinery that continue to this day at its worse.In all, this is a very entertaining album.Boyce & Hart really shine on their productions & Mike Nesmith's ""Papa Gene's Blues""&""Sweet Young Thing""solidfies his standing as a major talent.Dock some star for its cookie cutter approach & the treatment of the group as mere pop music puppets.I'm surprised Papa Nes was even allowed to produce his own tracks,let alone write them"
4,Such a wonderful cd,"I had alot of fun with this cd when i first got it because it was the first cd of The Monkees that i got and it has quite a few great songs on it like:""saturdays Child""""Lets dance on""and the one's i was most proud to play for everyone at my b-day party was:""Gonna buy me a dog""""last train to Clarksville""But there were a few duds that i was disapointed in like:""I dont think you know me""""I can't get her off mind""But there was this very short interesting version of the monkees theme that was played at the beginning credits of the show that is on this cd.Personaly i suggest that all monkee lovers have this cd in their collection it is an original classic, That i am proud to own and show to everybody!"
3,GOOD T.V. SOUNDTRACK,"To me this and More of the Monkees will always be soundtracks of the show and despite the fact that the Monkees did not play on this album it is still a gem. My favourite songs are ""Take A Giant Step"",""Saturday's Child"",""Last Train To Clarkesville"" and ""I'll Be True To You"". The only bad song is ""This Just Doesn't Seem To Be My Day"" and it is not that bad. The bonus tracks are not special but they are good. If your a fan of the t.v. show you will love this but if you want to see good Monkee song writing and instrument playing you will be left scratching your head because this album was played by studio musicians."
5,bananas for the monkees,"loved this first album when i was 13 and still love to listen to it now. was so pleased to be able to get it as a cd. if you are a monkees fan,this is a must have cd."
5,"AS MANY HAVE SAID... ""A GREAT SOUNDTRACK ALBUM""","I JUST GOT THIS CD THREE DAYS AGO AND I LOVE IT! I AGREE THAT IT IS A SOUNDTRACK TO THE EARLY SHOWS. THE HIGHLIGHTS ARE...""TOMORROWS GONNA BE ANOTHER DAY""""PAPA GENE'S BLES""""LET'S DANCE ON""""SWEET YOUNG THING""""GONNA BUY ME A DOG""AND ""(THEME FROM) THE MONKEES(early version)""I ALREADY HAVE FOUR OF THEIR CD'S BUT THEY WERE NOT REAL ALBUMSI HAVE""GREATEST HITS""""I'M A BELIEVER""""LIVE 1967""AND THE VERY RARE ""THEN & NOW ""... THE BEST OF THE MONKEES""SOON I'M GOING TO BUY ""MORE OF THE MONKEES"" AND I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT."
4,"The ""soundtrack"" to many of their early shows...great fun","It's too bad that The Monkees get a bum-rap from a lot of people. Their music has a certain magic to it, and despite not being 'allowed' to play their own music on a lot of their recordings, they really were for the most part good musicians, well, except Davy, but he could sing so it was ok. Mickey was a great guitarist but was made to learn the drums for the show, which he did and became an accomplished drummer. This album was their first and was a great success. That the musicians on it are not The Monkees, is a fact that should not interfere with the good stuff on it. Just listen, and enjoy!"
4,Not a Bad Way to Start Out,"This is the Monkees first album, and it wasn't a bad start. Their first hit ""Last Train to Clarksville is on this, and also some other good songs. Including the novelty, ""Gonna Buy Me a Dog."" One of my favorite tracks is ""Take a Giant Step."" I also like ""Saturday's Child"" too. If you're a Monkee fan it's a must for the collection"
3,The Monkees,Songs: Side One - 1. The Monkees (theme from TV program) 2. Saturday's Child 3. I Wanna Be Free 4. Tomorrow's Gonna Be Another Day 5. Papa Gene's Blues 6. Take a Giant Step.

3,Well done for a cookie cutter album,"Granted,this is the pop music machinery at its worse.All in allthis is a very entertaining album.Boyce & Hart really shine on their productions & Mike Nesmith's ""Papa Gene's Blues""&""Sweet Young Thing""solidfies his standing as a major talent.Dock some star for its cookie cutter approach & the treatment of the group as mere pop music puppets.I'm surprised Papa Nes was even allowed to produce his own tracks,let alone write them"
5,"It was great, and had my favorite songs on it.",This CD Had my favorite song on it which is Tommorrow's Gonna be Another Day.I like it because it was thier first CD.
4,"Mid-section trudges along, but worth the read!","Leave yourself some long periods to knock this one offquickly -- it drags along for a large section in the middle.Being from Rumford, or ""Rehoboth,"" I was intrigued to learnof actual hometown history. It prompted me to research theincident.Raven was reviewed very positively on National Public Radioin late summer/fall 1996 and it deserves the praise. Veryinteresting historically-based fiction.Tom PattersonMinneapolis"
4,An artsy potrayal of two tough towns and their inhabitants,"I just finished the Raven, by Peter Landesman. I'm pretty sure that I got the gist of it, but some very significant aspects of the story were still fuzzy even after I had finished. This was illustrated most unclearly to me in regard of the numerous families of the mill town of Rehoboth who lost relatives of the Raven. Also having lived in immedite proximity to Bailey Island, Orrs, and Great/ Sebascodegan Island, I found some of Landesman's geographical descption to be a stretch. The places that he mentions are readily identifiable on a chart, but are not possibly reached in the succesuion that he describes his characters as doing. This is understandable, the story still flowed nicely. For me, the most enjoyable aspect of this book was Landesman's use of similie and metaphor. Dull areas in the plot were made interesting and profound by his artful coparisons."
2,Glad I only Pile at Ohlson's,"Having read the previous reviews, I wonder if I read the same book; or should I say bookS plural. I got 150pp into the story before giving up since I couldn't figure out what a paper mill and its pollution had to do with the disappearance of a boatload of daytrippers. Pulled up these reviews, and about 2 months later, tried once more, and fm page 1. Still no joy. Author seemed to have at least 3 possibly great stories...but I never got the connections, if any. Some time you get the bear, and sometimes he gets you. Caveat Emptor."
2,Unresponsive joystick ruins the game,"I was a big Pac-Man fan growing up (and still am, I guess), so I was very excited about getting this play-at-home version. The graphics, sounds and overall game are exactly as I remember them, definitely not a bad remake. BUT...the joystick, or how it's connected to the software is really aweful. About 1 out of 5 times you press the joystick a certain direction, the game simply doesn't respond. A ghost is coming, so you turn the other way...but Pac-Man just continues to run right into him. It was really maddening, so much so that after spending 10 minutes trying to figure out what I was doing wrong, I realized it's just not made well. I think this is a cute ""retro"" gag gift, but not really made for anyone who really wants to play the game or hopes to get beyond level one, due to a poorly engineered controller."
4,A beautiful collection,"ABBA's music has been the soundtrack to my life! I love that ""someone"" thought to make an anthology of their love songs. The songs tell of different kids of love; romantic, child/parent, friendship and the end of a love too. God, how sad is ""The Winner Takes It All""?....While I cherish this album, I gave it a four because I think some important ABBA love songs were forgotten. Also, I don't like ""Eagle"" and it made it on the CD. Oh well."
4,An Access Workbook,"This was exactly the book I was looking for. Plenty of books explain database concepts, some explain Access concepts. This is a workbook that shows you how to USE Acess, rather than explaining it to you. It won't explain why things work, but it will show you how.I had a general grasp of database concepts but needed practice in using Access. This book gave it to me. I wouldn't buy this book as my only Access book. But if you've been reading up on databases, and still can't create the application you need, this book may help."
5,You can start your Gypsy Jazz collection right here,"I agree with all of the other reviews, Bireli Lagrene is phenomenal. However, his collaboration with violinist Florin Niculescu makes this program! Niculescu is masterful at the art created by Stephane Grapelli, and takes a back seat to no one on the planet when it comes to knowing his way around the violin. Buy this DVD for his performance alone, and get the great Lagrene as an added bonus!"
3,A masterpiece for peanuts...,"If you haven't heard Mahler's Eighth, you have no excuse for passing this one up at this price. The orchestra and choir play well, but many of the vocal soloists are weak. Also, the conducting is a bit hurried at times for my taste.If you really like Mahler's Eighth, I'd recommend that you go with the performances conducted by Sinopoli or Chailly. They both had better casts and better recording technologies at their disposal."
5,the very essence of jazz,"Not only is it in keeping with the traditions jazz, but it blazes trails, and takes the jazz listener (any listener, really) to new and unique places in music. This music is truly sublime."
4,This is a good gun for starters.,"This was the first air soft gun I ever had. It is a good gun it shoots at a good fps 200/250. The only problem with this gun is that if it is droped on a hard surface it will break, but with some time it can be fixed easily if you know what your doing. I would recommend this gun to air soft starters but for the more advanced players get a good battery or spring rifle."
4,its alright,"first, i ordered it thinking itd be black with a silver slide, but instead its a silver body and black slide, which is ok i guess. for some reason, if i fire with the silencer on, it sometimes pops off. also the fiber optic sight tends to slide off as well. i myself dont fight at all and its basically just for looks. so it suits my needs"
4,good gun badly made,when it first arived it was a really good gun it was right on target every shot i took.And then one day i was in a war with my friends and i droped it.after i picked it up the silencer broke off and the orange tip fell off so it now looks like a real gun.And by the way dont paint the orange tip black.i was at a cops house and i scared my @$$ off.so i would get this gun if i were a beginner.oh yah and by the way i'm not a beginner i have 15 airsoft guns
2,Bad gun,"this gun was my first gun, and at first, I thought it was pretty cool. but then, I tried in out in a war and it's accuracy was horrible, it goes up and to the right. I droped it and now tha magazine in broken. If I were you, I would go for a shotgun, I got one of thos and it is waaaaaaaaaaay better than the walther P99."
5,Great product! Very durable!!,"I looked at many backpacks for my boyfriend who travels alot and needed a durable backpack to use. This was the winner! VERY durable! Very roomy without being too bulky. He always comments how comfortable the straps are, even when the pack is full and (I think very) heavy! I strongly recommend this backpack...forgot to mention the price is GREAT for the product!"
4,Great backpack,"My son is a busy Sophomore, and this backpack is just the ticket for him. Excellent quality and speedy service."
4,Good for weekend travel,I bought this product for my short trips. Though it is meant for short trips some how I find it to be little smaller than expected. May be because I had to many to carry. Otherwise very comfortable and stylish.
3,Good bibliography,"The hype for this book is somewhat misleading. It is above all, a reference for students interested in who is saying what in which papers, than an overview of farming."
4,a brilliant revisionist look at the Progressive Era,"Kolko does an excellent job of making the case that business regulations enacted during the Progressive Era (1900-1916) were due not to liberal reformers, but big business itself! From meat industry regulations to the FTC and the Federal Reserve Board, Kolko shows over and over again how industries sought Federal regulation in order to protect themselves from competition or secure other advantages.Whether you're liberal, conservative or libertarian, this book is a must-read for understanding the relationship between government and big business."
3,"Turgid writing, and rampantly revisionist","Anyone without a firm grip of economic theory and, more importantly, economic vocabularly will struggle with this rather turgid book. However, if you can deal with the writing style, and are interested in progressivism, Kolko certainly gives a good negative reference point at the extreme end of the historiographical spectrum."
4,Great Halloween Album,"I have purchased this CD twice now. We purchased it years ago, before Hurricane Katrina. We lost our house, and possessions, in Katrina but my boys, now older, never forgot this album. It has some hip, good songs. Many are funny. The songs by Elvira are the best. Recommended. Monsta' Rap is a really good, fun song."
3,How can anyone give this album 5 stars??,"It only has 7 songs and 2 segments, it's worth it if you can get it cheap with the two top tracks being from alice cooper and will smith but it's nowhere near a 5 star album"
5,One of the all time great martial arts books,"This book is very inspirational. It is a story of CW Nicol's karate training and every time I read it, it re-inspires me to train. If you ever find a copy, grab it!"
4,Great shoe,"Received these shoe's prior to departing for Ruidoso, NM. Very comfortable and the STEALTH technology soles worked really well on slippery surfaces. Received the wrong color (Green vice Khaki) but I liked the color so I kept them."
5,"Comfort, Perfomance, and Durability in One Shoe...","I have been a fan of FiveTen and Stealth rubber for well over a decade. I recently purchased the ""Guide"" and I can honestly say that these are the best hiking shoes that I have ever owned. Comfort, performance, and durability rolled into one shoe. I am an avid hiker. I live just outside of Rocky Mountain National Park, in the Colorado Rockies. The predominant surface on the majority of trails is rock. The ""Stealth C4 Rubber"" is amazing, and greatly decreases the chance of slips or falls. If you are serious about your hiking and are on rocky terrain, I would highly recommend this, or a similar FiveTen shoe!"
5,Wonderful Photographs,"Mr. Burns has done a wonderful job in putting together this book for use by either a layman or a serious birdwatcher. I had the fortune to meet Jim and his wife Deva and they are fascinating people. Jim came across as very knowledgeable not just about owls, but about North American birds in general. His photography is superb despite the inherent difficulty of photographing owls. And the accompanying narrative is a delight to follow. Kudos to Mr. Burns for succeeding admirably on a challenging topic!"
5,Roz Rules!,"-And so do the other characters in this book-the Doctor is in the background in this story-but somehow the story works. It is exciting, funny, and all-around great book and my personal favorite."
2,I do not recommend,"First, my DVD was scratched and it was difficult to get it to work. When I finally did, all the workouts require additional pieces of equipment. There is nothing that indicates that those items are required before you play the DVD. It was a complete turn off for me. If equipment is needed for the exercises, it would be nice to know so that I could plan accordingly."
3,No 3rd Trimester workouts,"I love the video and the workouts feel great-not too long, not too easy, but I wish it had workouts for the 3rd trimester too."
2,deceptive and awkward,"The description of this video is deceptive. The workouts are tailored month-by-month. The first workout is for women in the first month of pregnancy, the second for the second month, and on through month six. So if you're already in your sixth month, like I am, this video isn't very useful.A lot of equipment is required: light weights, bands, and a workout ball. Since I only have weights, I had to improvise for the exercises with the bands and workout ball.Gabrielle awkwardly follows the directions of her trainer. It doesn't seem like the two planned the workouts very well. Gabrielle appears to not to know what's coming next.While Gabrielle looks gorgeous, she doesn't smile and she seems nervous and uncomfortable in front of the camera.The workouts are very short, and I didn't feel like I accomplished much in the 20 minutes. It was awkward to follow, not very fun, challenging, or satisfying. I guess if you're looking for a quick workout, it'll do. But I'm pretty disappointed."
1,disappointed,i wish i would have known that you would have to have a partner to help you with all the changes of equipment. if i had known that i would'nt have bought the dvd
4,Pretty good DVD,Its not your typical bubbly techno blaring workout video (which is nice. lol) It does has a nice break down of exercises. Good variety of workouts. No workouts for third trimester which is a majoy bummer.
2,Very basic and boring,Though this DVD offers great tips on technique I broke more of a sweat going upstairs to the bonus-room to work out. I was a little disappointed. Gabrielle is such a supreme athlete I was hoping that she would put out a DVD that was somewhat match her level of fitness.I would recommend this for any novice pregnant woman just getting into working out as opposed to someone who is at an intermediate or an advanced level.
2,Boring,"Sorry to say both Gabi and her trainer need a little more personality. It's not only a slow workout, but they are boring. I've tried 3 of the 6 workouts and haven't been impressed."
3,Not as vigorous as I expected,"I was disappointed with this video. The workouts are too short and it doesn't seem like the trainer does enough reps. I've got all the equipment needed, but the pace at which we're expected to switch gears is annoying. Gabrielle Reese has her trainer handing her the weights, band and ball but those of us doing it at home aren't so lucky. I feel like I spend half the workout keeping track of my equipment. That said, I do think it has stregthened my back and abs and Reese is pleasant enough on camera. I wouldn't buy it again though."
3,Gabrielle Reece,"I thought this DVD was ok. I didn't make it through a whole workout. I was so excited to get started but I went through about a half hour and felt like we hadn't even accomplished anything. Its not the style where she does the exercises and you follow along at home and get the workout done in an hour... The whole time she had a personal trainer guy going over the moves and showing her how to do them. I guess you can go through it once and memorize the moves to do on your own later but I can't imagine watching and following along every day, seems like a waste of time for every day use. I got a better use of my time using Lindsay Brin's prenatal series."
4,well rounded pre-natal workoutS,"I started using this dvd around 10 weeks and am now in week 26. At first it was frustrating that Gabby's trainer assisted her so much & used so much equipment but with a little creativity most of the exercises can be adapted using dumbbells instead of a theraband. Some guidance from the trainer on how to make these adaptations would be great if they decide to come out with an updated edition. Overall the workouts are wonderfully well rounded & I think have gotten better in the 2nd trimester. I can't speak much to the 3rd trimester yet. It is also great that there is a new workout for each month, keeping the workout fresh. Very glad to have found this pre-natal work out dvd. Also recommend Perfect Pregnancy workout, vol. 1. It is longer & is really excellent."
4,Great value for active non-audiophile use,"I've been using these earbuds for a few years now. Normal earbuds tend to fall out of my ears constantly so I absolutely love the rubbery, flexible over-the-ear clips that keep these buds right in place. The clips don't even interfere with my glasses.Now, don't get me wrong, if you're looking for audiophile sound from a cheap pair of earbuds like these, you're kidding yourself. These are amazingly low priced and ideal for gym workouts, using with cheap flash-based mp3 players, and just general active use. They also don't block out sounds completely so they're convenient for using in situations where you need to be aware of things going on around you while listening to music.As for durability, I picked up a couple pairs and after years of wear and tear under all sorts of indoor and outdoor circumstances both pairs still work great."
2,Don't fit,"I love the design and light-weight feel of these earbuds. I can't even tell that I'm wearing them.Unfortunately, the buds themselves are too large for my ear canals. Instead of going in my ear, they just rest on against my ear canal. So, I'm not getting the full effect of the bass and volume. Since I've always worn earbuds and never had this problem before, I think it's a design flaw.I'd only recommend these to people who don't listen to loud music."
5,Master of the instrument,"The music is wonderful. While critics may say he's all technique, it's a pronouncement of frustration, no one else can match his playing. He is, simply stated, incomparable."
3,Some Very Fine; Remainder Not So Much,"A few of the selections in this collection are quite nice and a pleasure to hear; however, others are very poor and not worth the space they occupy on the disc. One is so bad it sounds like it was recorded under water. Even that could be an enjoyable novelty if it was consistent and didn't sound like it was also skipping. I transferred the good cuts and don't expect to listen to the entire collection a second time. A disappointment."
2,Nice while they lasted,"This set was nice, initially. I loved the way they looked, and they were very comfortable to hold. However, after having these for about 3 months, they are beginning to acquire rust spots. Very annoying, and definitely not something I would put out for others to see. Not worth the money...."
5,Absolutely Great.,"I have absolutely no complaints on this product. I love the shape of the handles, each flat end of the ""pyramid"" fitting comfortably against your hands. Each piece is weighted for easy handling and perfectly balanced for control. The dinner knives are superb, even for slicing through meats. I've had no trouble with any piece bending under pressure. I also wash this silverware in a metal sink, with no scuffs or scratches noticeable. The package was shipped as planned, arrived in a timely manner, and everything was well intact."
5,This book was Fantastic !! A 6 year old must read book!!!,Hi! I am 6 yrs old and I loved this book. This book was great. It was sad but than very happy. I like Freddy and Tom. Freddy taught me a lesson. Never to quit and to find help. Freddy also had very good friends. I think that all 6 yr olds should read this book. The best thing is you can read it TO your parents instead of them reading it to you.
1,BORRRRRRINNNNNNG,"Fell asleep with this on, it's that dull. Despite the big name artists doing their versions of holiday tunes, this isn't their best work. I've tried listening to it several times, even trying different tracks rather than in the order they are on the disc. Just not my cup of tea, I guess."
5,gorgeous cross stitch,beautiful cross stitch designs for all the major holidays. easy to follow graphs.
3,Bland,"The designs are mostly large, rather bland scenes. For the price of the book, I don't think it is worth it. Invest your money in something else."
5,Great drug/gang movie that ranks up there with Snatch and Lock Stock and two smoking barrels,When i saw the trailer for this movie I tought it wwould be something worth watching i thought it would be decent. I thought this movie had the twists and turns of snatch and lock stock and two smoking barrels and a little added love triangle (i guess). Many people i have heard don't like the ending but don't make any assumptions about it and you will be fine. This movie is now one of my favorite movies and a treasured part of my DVD collection.
4,Twisted Cake,"After seeing the new Casino Royal, i was compelled to view this film. it did not dissapoint. DC is a true star."
2,Not very good.,"Just another boring gangster movie in the same vein as Gangster #1.If you like foul language that uses foul language just for the sake of it, barely comprehensible plot and pointless violence then you will love it, if not then avoid.Craig should stick to Bond."
3,what are the characters saying?,"If we could understand what the characters are saying, this would be a great film. The accents are so heavy, and the voices so muffled, that we cannot understand most of the important plot elements are; which lessons the enjoyment of the movie. I watched it because of Daniel Craig; I didn't even know he was the star before I rented it. There is a neat tiny scene in the film, a slit second, really, where Craig's character ( who hates guns ) picks up a revolver and holds it up in front of his face just like James Bond ( the picture is on the box ). Since this is before he was picked for Bond, we wonder what was going on.I didn't like the ending; but I notice that there are two alternate endings included on the DVD; so it doesn't really matter. Totally enjoyable and realistic, Needs subtitles."
3,A very bland cake.,"I concur with the masses in saying that this movie mostly rehashes what has already been done better before in other movies. It's not bad entertainment for an evening, but unlikely to inspire a repeat viewing."
3,Too many players on the field.,"""Layer Cake"" has at least one layer too many; a lot of the time it's hard to figure out what's going on, and who's playing whom. To make matters worse, the various British accents made it difficult for this American to understand a lot of the dialogue. If you like this genre, I would suggest watching Pulp Fiction or The Usual Suspects instead. Overall, I give ""Layer Cake"" a low 3 stars."
4,Great Movie Great Price,This is a great movie for a great price. I love the cinematography and fast paced narrative that drives the story
5,If you havent seen this do it NOW,This is the movie that got Daniel Craig the role as James Bond. It is a movie that will go down as a cult favorite. Great story and acting. I wont give it away but to say it is somewhat like Snatch.
5,"""Don't get high...""","Well, with this one - I had high expectation and I really enjoyed it. Non-hollywood style, nice soundtrack, great dialogs, great acting. Maybe I am partial to non-us movies, but this one definitely stands out.I would totally recommend it. One can say it promotes drug business or so, but people are the ones who make decisions, not pills. That is up to them to decide whether to be ""happy now - stupid later...""Great movie!"
3,Convoluted Plot,"The acting was great, but I had a hard time hearing what some of the actors were saying (they seemed to mumble) and the plot was so convoluted I ended up with some questions I couldn't answer. I really wanted to like this, but in the end I just kind of shrugged and moved on. A pity, as it could have been a great film."
3,Layer Cake starring Daniel Craig,"Hmmmmmmmm, interesting movie. It was very convoluted and complex. I think we are going to have to watch it again to understand it. Not the most engaging movie, and we DO quit watching bad movies after giving them a good try....so we wouldn't categorize as ""bad"". I KNOW there are people out there who will enjoy it. Daniel Craig is an amazing actor, and he is good in this. All of the acting was good...good directing, excellent sets, no hokey music, nothing distracting.....just didn't have that ""something"" that made it GREAT."
3,Welcome To The Layer Cake,"I thought this movie was okay, i thought it could of have been better if it was not for daniel craig's awesome performance this movie would of been a toatl dud. The only reason i'm giving it three stars is because of daniel craig. This movie was not even funny. well all in all it was okay."
3,Fun,"My friend leant me the DVD, which my bulldog ate before I had a chance to watch it. Once it arrived I found it to be the typical ""gangster"" flick. Daniel Craig....MMMMMMMMMMMMM...go Bond Go"
1,Threw it in the trash.,"Poor script. Dialogue was tedious. After wasting 15 minutes I'll never get back, threw it in the trash. [I know, should have sold it back via Amazon, but was so disappointed I would have felt guilty at having pawned it off on someone else.]"
2,There Was Cake?,"This movie is not about cake. I was waiting for the nice table and cake party, but all in the movie these men do is walk around serious and look at each other. They smoke and talk funny, and sometimes sit at a table and drink drinks. They need ballons and hats!!! The movie made me feel like small because I was always looking from under a table or behind a napkin on the floor and even through the cigigrates smokes (maybe that's why they all die in the end; remember, smoking hurts you!!) Even when they sit in nice club with girls there was no cake. I think this movie is tricky that way, because you think cake, party, and nice talkings, you have no talkings, just sad music and people who are mad and hurt. Maybe the movie is a lesson on why cake is important. Eat cake!!!! (Three more stars if even one slice, but only two today!!!)"
1,Sour Cake,"I challenge anyone to explain the storyline of this movie. At half way thru this so called thriller, I ejected the dvd and it went directly to my rummage pile (aka eBay). Trying to follow the plot of this movie is like trying to cross a busy street blind folded. Entirely to many names/characters to remember let alone who's who. The dialog is hard to understand when spoken. As you totally start to loose what the movie is about you find yourself rewinding to try to gain the plot. I bought this movie because of the write up (hype) and because it stared Daniel Craig. With Craig in the main role, a 2010 release, I figured I had a winner. Couldn't have been be more wrong."
2,typical british movie.,"bad script, bad directing and editing. the story itself is also too british random. lotss of blah,blah,blah, lotsa comedian/clown-like, small-timer roles in this movie. again, typical british. very forgetable.i only got one question floated up onto my mind during watching:how could they chose this guy to be the next 007? i predict this guy would only survive one shot in 007 series. if compare the other several one-shot 007 castings with this guy. this one is definitely the worst choice."
1,Is not in stock,Unfortunately Amazon is saying this is in stock (as with many other products on the website) -- yet days later you receive a later apologizing for the delay. Be aware of this if you are buying for Xmas
5,Great Movie,all around great movie. Action and spy cases with great acting! everyone should watch this movie. Oh and it has Daniel Craig...need I say more?
4,very good,"So what did I like about Layer Cake? Well, Daniel Craig is... well look at him. The man is so hot he should be leaving a smoke trail every time he's on screen. Next, I loved how this movie does not glamorize the drug trade. Yeah, there's a fortune to be made but you pay for it and if you aren't smart you die and usually in a really painful, nasty way.Craig's character, Mr.X is cool, oh so smart and sick of the life he's living. He wants out and only has to do his boss a ""favor"" in order to be able to retire. It seems so simple, so clear cut but Mr. X discovers that is not the case. Two scenes stayed with me long after I watched the movie. First, when X has to kill a man and his reaction to that. Watching Craig try to get some sleep, try to drug and drink his memory away was fascinating. The second memory scorcher is the very last scene which I won't describe. I'll only note that it's amazing how much emotion Craig can register with just his eyes.Buy Layer Cake it's worth the money."
4,Excellent British Mob Film!!,"Film was very much like a Quentin Tarantino movie, where everything and everyone is inter-connected somehow, just like a layer cake. Fast paced and brutal. Not for the faint at heart but exactly what you need if an adrenal junkie. Matthew Vaughn the director was wicked!! A must see."
4,cool movie.,"I knew Daniel Craig would make an excellent James Bond after seeing him in action here. ""Layer Cake"" invites comparison with other films from that distinct genre of which it is apart. Along with ""Snatch"" ""Layer Cake"" is the best of the British gangster films to come along over the last couple decades. Plot, acting, cinematography - **all top notch**. That it is a directorial debut makes it even more impressive. Things do get a little hairy Plot wise, so do pay attention mate. You'll dig this flick I'm sure."
5,So good...,"I just wish there were more movies like this one. Is one of the best crime pictures I've seen. The plot, the photography, the elegance of the characters. The humanizinig of the main role not as a superbeing but a guy with a business in a situation that goes out of hand. Very easy to feel identified with.Welcome to the layer cake.I just hope Hollywood keeps out of remaking it.Just add it to your cart already, you won't regret it."
2,Very English and Dated,Part of the problem I did not enjoy the video is that the language includes British slang that I just dont't get. The other problem was that the story and the video quality were dated and poor by present standards.
1,no frosting here,"boring typical drug movie bad acting , typical [plot. why am I required to write a certain number of letters...the movie was a stinker OK?"
2,disappointed,the quality of the film was terrible also it kept interfering the film to power up very annoying this has happened on other rentals title of the film layer cake
4,Not Bad,"An interesting take on the crime drama. If these types of movies are your thing, you'll like this one. Watch it."
3,Incomprehensible Cockney accents,"Once you get past the at-times unintelligible Cockney - this was intended for Brit audiences, I guess - the film moves along at a decent clip, though the plot twists are hard to follow and the whole beginning is so slow as to be almost bad enough for the viewer to give up - as I did. I then re-inserted the disc a few days later, and found the pace to be picking up enough to watch it through to completion. The usual druggie gangster nonsense, with the requisite plot twists and double crosses, comes along then. The photography is the film's best point. Worth a watch."
4,"A last drug score that gets bungled in drouble crosses and misinformation, as expected","In Layer Cake, Daniel Craig plays Mister X, a top drug dealer roped into one last score before retirement. As last scores tend to go, the deal gets bungled in double crosses, misinformation, and the conflicting motives of the different players. In the end, Mr. X pulls of an impressive stunt to satisfy the good guys, the bad guys, and the law, but otherwise, there isn't much to set this movie apart from the pack of crime and drug-score flicks. You've see this movie before in a couple other incarnations."
2,Waste of talent,"The acting was great, but it just could not make up for the lack of a good storyline. Totally unbelieveable."
5,"I Told Everyone I Know This is a ""Must See""","I had never heard of this movie (don't know how I missed it) but once I saw it, I bought three copies to send to all my brothers and told all my friends about it. It's a great story with a great plot twist."
5,Best In Its Class,"British crime movie in the vain of Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels or Snatch. It's mostly a drama but there is action and dark comedy mixed in. Great fleshed-out characters. Soundtrack includes some great '80s brit-pop/new wave. Top notch acting by everyone involved. You can definitely see why Daniel Craig got the Bond gig. Takes itself a bit more serious than Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels and it's actually a better movie. In my opinion, the pinnacle (so far) of the plot -twisting British crime movies."
3,Great movie - poor BluRay,"Great english gangster movie.Poor BluRay transfer, at least for the European version, because of poor color calibration, aliasing and MPEG2 encoding. Of course, it's better than DVD but far below the best BluRays."
4,Layers upon Layers,"First off, I'm not a kid, just don't feel like signing on, so please do take this seriously and don't discard it because you think I'm a child. Now, onto the review. The movie itself is flawless in plot and acting. I found it to be very entertaining and quite a clever movie. I for one liked it more than Snatch.The dvd set is really good also. It comes with some un neccesary deleted scens, but still fun to watch. I prefer the original edning to the 2 alternate ones. It has a brief making of and an interesting Q & A. The ending of the movie itself is sub-par, I rather did not enjoy it. It is concieved and un-certain of itself, not a good thing in this case. That's the reason for the four. But otherwise a good British Thriller and a well rounded out dvd. Worthy of a purchase."
4,"Nice sound, need improvementat low frequency","Good sound, amazing resolution. But need more power at low frequency. Anyway, I should not have expected too much from speakers with such volume :D"
4,What is this,"I'm confused.The title is for SQL Anywhere for Linux, the specs list windows operating systems and the Item Number and description are for a package of recordable CD ROM disks. Whats being sold here?"
3,The Country Pig,"Similar storyline as ""Charlotte's Web"" and too long a read for me as a parent. But my son enjoys it and asks lots of questions regarding it."
5,Must Have For Studio,"I bought these for their main purpose, to connect by studio monitors(KRK G2 5) to my computer.I use this cable on the daily bases due to the fact : I am a musician !I have these in my home studio and do not remove the xlr inputs at all, only the input jack from my interface to my computer.The product is somewhat cheap built but it handles the job. I believe the product is not intended for heavy use as in, touring, live sound, shows, or being removed often.Overall the product is good for all you home recordist, home studio owners, and those in need of connecting your studio monitors together.If this review was helpful pleae give it a thumbs up:)Honest buyer"
1,don't waste your money,"I bought the hosa stereo 3.5mm two xlm, 2m and when I tryed to use it, doesn't worked. Do not waste your money. Very low quality."
5,The stunning series continues!!,"Book 4 - Truan of Monroe was raised as an orphan on the Isle in the Irish Sea, a deadly warrior and a sorcerer of great powers. Also, the son of Merlin, he must pass through a doorway, back in time to the days of Camelot, where Merlin has been banished for all time. Amber follows him, unwilling to lose him, standing at Truan side as he finishes the battle with Malagraine.Quinn Taylor Evan is a must!!"
3,So-So,"I have enjoyed the three books which came before this one in the series. And I LOVED the character of Truan Monroe when he was introduced in book 3. I was happy when I realized that he had gotten his own story and we could find out more about him. The only thing (a MAJOR thing) that didn't thrill me about this book was the heroine. I just couldn't see why she appealed to him. Compared to Vivian, Brianna, and Cassandra she appeared dull and lackluster. Sorry if that appears harsh. Just my humble opinion! The bottom line is while I enjoyed the book I wasn't rooting for the couple to get together as strongly as I did in the first three."
3,"I guess I'm the wrong reviewer, but..","I read many books because they are connected to the Arthurian legends. A friend of mine gave me this series, more or less as a joke. I suppose if you like romance novels, you will like these.The reason I am reviewing this is in an attempt to have the book removed from my ""Instant Recommendations"" list..."
5,Exactly what I needed,I was thrilled to find this card. It was not sold in my area and was exactly what I needed. The card worked perfectly and has given us many happy photographic memories. The price was great and so was the shipping.
5,Very Pleased,I purchased this highchair for my grandson who is 5 months old. It only took his daddy less than 10 min. to assemble. (Not much assembling required.) Very stylish and easy to clean. Love the fact that it comes with 2 removable trays. Seating is comfortable for him now with the padding.
5,Great Highchair,"We love our new Boon Highchair! It's stylish, easy to clean, and simple to maneuver. I debated on this chair because of the cost, but after reading all the reviews I decided to purchase this chair. I couldn't be happier with it!!"
5,LOVE this chair!!,"We love this chair! It's simple and clean...unlike any other high chair we found!! It also continuously looks brand new versus dirty and food covered like normal, fabric padded high chairs! One simple wipe down after use and it looks as good as new! love the fact that it easily rolls from the kitchen to the dining table on our hardwood floors, locks in place and can be raised and lowered! The only drawback might be that the tray is a bit small...our daughter is only 8 months and only eats baby food from a small bowl, so the tray size is fine now...but as she grows and eats larger meals, I might hope to have a larger tray. Otherwise, it's a terrific chair!"
5,Loooove IT,"This high chair is sooo versatile,it moves with me all over. Easy clean up and modern design.I love it and so does my baby!"
3,Good,"I read all the reviews for this product and was very interested. Now that I have the chair...there are a few improvements I think they could offer.1) RE-Design the tray: a bigger tray that goes OVER the arm rests. My son gets food EVERYWHERE. I mean everywhere--each crack and crevice back front, below. I end up having to clean every square inch (almost) of the chair everytime we use it. So I wonder if it makes a difference having the slick design.2) 3 Tray covers AND a bigger coverage area of the tray covers.I do appreciate the modern design. It seems taking some of the old ideas and finessing them into this chair would be a good improvement."
1,Does not work as designed!!,"This chair would get a 5 star rating for design and use (both aesthetically, and mechanically). However, even after receiving a new pneumatic lift from Boon, the chair still will NOT lift up without my holding down the ""orange button"", and pulling up with both hands.And now, after only 3 months or so, the wheels from the bottom are popping off (I use my high chair on carpet). Before finding an actual wheel, I had found small metal balls on my carpet; and was clueless as to where they were coming from. Now I realize that they where ball bearings from the wheels.The quality and functionally of this chair makes me give it one star. It simply doesn't work. Next on my list is getting it fixed, or getting my money back. It pains me to write this review, because Boon is one of the few companies I normally buy products blindly from."
1,Disapointed,When I received this chair I was so disappointed. The reviews said the tray was small however I did not realize it would be so small that I could not fit a small bowl and a sippy cup on it. The plates I purchased for my son did not fit on it at all. The lift did not work well. I had to really push it hard for it to go down and pull for it to come up. the brake does not work if you have hard wood floors. It doesn't lock the wheels so the chair can still move freely. It is very cute. my son looked adorable in it but for the $$ I want a chair I will be able to use for a long time.************ pay attention to the return policy! I returned this item 3 weeks ago and still don't have my $$. They say it can take 4 weeks! ***************
1,Don't Buy This High Chair!,"I am a design junkie and bought this chair because it is one of the few out there that actually looks good in my contemporary kitchen. However, I have owned the high chair for less than a year and two of the wheels under the base have broken off. And they are broken in a way that cannot be repaired. We have not by any means abused this chair--it has only been rolled about 6ft at a time and only by an adult. With two of the wheels broken off, the chair won't roll at all without scratching my floor. And it is lopsided, wobbling back and forth on the base when my 14-month old sits in it. Furthermore, I think it is harder to clean than some of these reviews suggest. The white foam seat cushion stains with spaghetti sauce and the stains don't come out."
2,Brake wheel came off,"We have had this for about 6 months now. We love the looks and the fact that it is easy to clean. However, everything else seems to be a problem. The break does not work well on hardwood floors. I called up Boon customer service and they were of no help. Last week, the brake wheel came off. Also, I feel there is not enough room between my child and the tray. There are two different settings for locking the tray in place, however, even on the farthest setting, the tray pushes against her tummy."
4,Great Highchair Option,"We love the look and the function of the highchair. The tray is a little small and the seat doesn't recline, but otherwise, it looks great, cleans up easily and is super safe."
5,Everything it is made out to be,"This is a very easy to use, easy to clean high chair, and was perfect for my son just as he was starting to use a high chair and was still a little unstable sitting up. The tray is at the perfect height, and the heigh chair is not too difficult to move for meals outside. I would recommend this high chair to anyone willing to spend the money, though he also has a high chair at his grandparents house that was $20 from IKEA and works just fine."
4,Boon high chair,We bought this for our 6 month old when he was ready to start eating. From the beginning the brake hasn't worked but this hasn't really affected our use of the high chair. We live in a townhouse where we don't have a ton of room so the Boon is perfect for a small condo and it has a contemporary look. I've read that the table is a little small but we are very happy with the overall size. We also use the high chair as a toy for our son as we play choo choo in the house. The only negative is that the chair is not so comfortable for our son. When he goes to his Grandmother's he uses a cheesy brand high chair and never fusses. He cries when we put him in the Boon but this will improve as he sits better. Overall very happy with the boon
5,Best High Chair on the market!,"This is the best thing I have bought since I had the baby!Not only is the high chair really easy to clean but it looks great too. It was really simple to put together and is very sturdy. I also love the fact that you can move it around with ease. I was a bit apprehensive because of the price and there was nowhere were I could see the product, but I have absolutely no regrets. I also never write reviews but felt this product had to be highly recommended to other parents.Finally a great product which is both functional and stylish!"
4,Cleaner alternative to fabric high chairs,"I bought this high chair after much research, and after owning a Baby Trend model.Pros: Easy to clean, much more sanitary, cool looking design, comes with two snap-on tray liners.Cons: Brakes don't work very well, tray is too small, shoulder straps are too easy to get out of, snap-in ""buckle"" falls right where tray rests against baby's belly, main tray is not dishwasher safe, tray liners do not cover entire tray (so you have to wash it every time anyway).Neutral: Though the pneumatic lift is a cool idea, as a mother who doesn't adjust the height of her high chair, I found it kind of silly and useless.Even though it appears from my review that the ""cons"" outweigh the ""pros"", I still give this chair 4 out of 5 stars simply because of how clean you can get it! You can take even the straps off and throw them in the washer. Plus, when your kid is in it, he looks like he's piloting a spaceship!"
4,Better than most and looks great,"The biggest problem we've had with all of the typical high chairs on the market is that food gets all stuck on and in the giant padded seats. The Boon high chair has a simple molded plastic seat that is very easy to clean and is still very comfortable for the baby. The Pneumatic lift is a nice feature, but it's action is kind of jerky going up and down and I'd like it to go higher than it does. Other than that minor issue, this is a great chair that looks fantastic."
2,not the best,"you get what you pay for, it isn't that powerful and the railing is very easily broken. its mostly just a good looking gun but, for actual use in matches etc it wouldn't cut it."
5,Baja Proven,"I started using Techni Ice when I lived in the Baja in the early 90's and have used them constantly ever since. If you put them in a zero degree freezer they will be zero while ice can only be 32 degrees max. Put all the ice in the world in a tub with whatever you want and it will get no colder then 32. I have put ice water bottles out of my fridge in a small cooler with Techni ice on day trips and it will have ice in the water at the end of the day. The company has improved this product over the years and they are a lot tougher then they were, they will not last forever and when frozen solid they are not flexible and should not be bended and forced into ice chests. Mine usually last about 5 years and are used almost daily."
3,Techni Ice---Works,The Techni Ice works if coolers kept closed. I had my last over 20 hours that in a 7 day cooler. Only thing I didn't like was the contents inside that freezes in the pack. Leaves a slimy residue on the outside after you activate them.It stays on your hand and it's the consistency of squeezing a slug. Other than that it kept things frozen. I would probably lay down a towel under the packs so it doesn't get on food.
5,Get it fast and know it works,"Got this cord just a few days after it was ordered, it not only was exactly what it said it would be, it also works without any gliches. I would buy Hosa from Amazon again..."
5,Product works perfectly,Doesn't have a locking device to stay plugged into the speaks/xlr inputs which is kinda odd but they don't fall out easily (pretty snug fit).The cable works though! pretty good protection of rubber on the outside of the wires as well. Love it.
2,"Works OK, but be Careful","UPDATE: This unit has now totally broken. The static is very very bad, and it takes a number of attempts to get the cord in the right position where static wont play. This happened in under 2 months, but your milage may very. I was using this for an ipod connection to my RCF ART sound system in my room, as well as allowing friends to borrow it if they needed to DJ on XLR speakers but didnt have XLR outs. It had some heavy use, but it should have lasted longer then this. A good idea would be to make the 3.5mm connection swappable, in case the cable breaks at the end like mine did.This works ok, but has static when disconnecting from one source to another like any 3.5 connection will. Turn down your speakers if you are using it to account for bumps and crackles. Also the plug is a bit loose, and I had to use electrical tape to secure it. This is a good cable for the job though, because there honestly isnt much out there, so just treat it nicely."
3,thin,very likely to not last longer than 6 months with extensive moving around because its so thin but other than that it gets the job done
3,Highly technical but the writing could be better.,"Don Box is probably the most widely known authority on COM and this shows.From the motivating example of the first chapter, to thoroughdiscussions of object location, instantation, naming, remote invocation, this book was certainly worth reading.But sometimes I feel like the author is showboating with his opaque/jargon-filled writing; it just isn't as clear as saya Kernighan, a Tanenbaum or even some others writing about MS Specific Technology."
2,"To cenceptual, not practical for a newby to COM","The biggest problem I've had with this book is that the examples are incomplete. I am used to learning by starting with a basic program and implementing more and more features of the api step by step. In this I can ensure I have mastered the basic concepts before moving on. Unfortunetly this book does not use this technic. Although it starts with the basics and progresses, it does not have working examples of just the basic implementation. Therefore if you are confused by a particular section that does not have much practical code, then you are at a loss and will not be able to move on through the book since subsequent sections will be building upon the one that you may have stumbled on. Code snippets are just not enough for me to grasps the subject. There is a complete example downloadable from the book's website, but the example implements all of the advanced features, which is far to overwhelming for a COM novice such as myself."
5,Buy this if you want to understand what COM solves and how you can do it without COM.,Yes it is 2013 and COM technology is almost history. But if you want to make a product with Win32 dll that needs to be binary compatible with products built using different compilers without COM then books explains you very well on how to do it in the very first chapter of Why COM?
3,"FIRST 2 CHAPTERS ARE GOOD, REST OF CHAPTERS ARE DENSE","The first 2 chapters are excellent. Don gives a very clear explanation of how COM was developed. The rest of the book seems to be a lot of ideas packed into a small area. The topics covered could easily fill 2 or 3 books, if explained properly, but I feel Don wanted to cram in as much information as possible into his 1 book, making it suffer."
2,Think Twice,This is not a book for learning COM. The problem is that it's also not a very good medium to advanced COM book either. It's more like a white paper or a brief on COM. I got the feeling like he was rushing to get through all the topics. I felt the book was poorly written and hard to follow. I would suggest reading the COM Spec from Microsoft before reading Essential COM.
2,"Should have been titled ""COM for C++ Developers""","For a book on the topic of COM (a language-independent binary standard for component software development), Essential COM is incredibly biased towards C++ developers. As a VB5/6 and Delphi developer, after about seventy-five pages I realized that this book was a waste of my time. I recommend that the author look to books like Design Patterns to understand how to present topics in a more language-independent way. This might be a good book for C++ developers, but anyone else seeking a thorough understanding of COM (without suffering through an excruciating history of the C++ shortcomings that led to the development of COM in the first place) should look elsewhere."
2,You will need a PhD in COMology to understand,"WOW!!! This book is hard to follow with nothing tangible to the typical VC++/MFC programmer. The word on the street is Box does not even acknowledge MFC exists. That is very evident in this almost useless book. What I could stay awake through, I understood almost nothing. MFC makes COM so much easier, Try looking for an MFC COM book for something pratical."
4,"Very detailed, pretty demanding","The first 100 pages explain the basics of COM very detailed, but understandable nevertheless. However, when I wanted to use existing COM objects, I found myself lost in even more details on how to write my own COM objects. That was when I switched to ""Inside COM"". I keep turning to Don's book often for reference and in-depth information, where it is hard to beat."
