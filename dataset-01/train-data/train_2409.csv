5,The Best Album Ever,"Yo, this is Biggie's brother Wood once again, he was and still is the greatest rapper and person of all time. This is the best album ever because ofcourse his lyrics and the beats were just unbelievable. Yes, he is better than Tu-pac because he was not a real artist he was just saying what people wanted to hear, instead of coming from the heart with it. I love you Big and I hope one day I will once again see you, after death."
1,TALK BOUT AN OVERATED MC,"THIS MAN WASN'T NEARLY A POPULAR UNTIL HE DIED. HIS FIRST ALBUM DIDN'T SELL WELL AT ALL, THEN HE DIES, AND HE GOES 5 TIMES PLATINUM. IF U WANNA HEAR THA REAL MUZIK, BUT ALL EYEZ ON ME..."
1,Life after death has never been so boring,This is one lame album. Not a single stand-out track. Extremely disappointing. I expected better from this comic genius.
4,My views of Biggie's Album,"I think Biggie's album is really good but there are a few songs on there that are quite boring. For example 'I love the Dough' does not appeal to me at all, but overall he used good lyrics in all his songs."
3,Farewell to a Dope MC,"I don't know why this album is so critically acclaimed. It isn't near the effort that he put into ""Ready to Die"". Notice that many of the songs on Ready to Die are not produced by Puff Daddy, but rather Chucky Thompson, and Easy Moe Bee. This second album is infected by Puff Daddy, which is bad news. He does not come with the raw, clever lyrics like the first one. The albums content gets 3 stars, but the title and the timing of this album gets 5 stars because of the coincidence with his death. It is a shame that he died, but also a shame that his final album was like this. Peace to the real hip-hop."
5,I would rate this album more than five stars.,"I loved and miss Biggie and his music. THe best song on this album is You're Nobody, 'til Somebody Kills You. No one can replace Biggie ever. It'll have to take Puffy, Mase, The L.O.X., Total, Faith Evans, Black Rob, and 112 together to accomplish what Biggie did on one album. B.I.G. Forever. And Puffy too. I love you Puffy."
3,Notorious B.I.G. - Life In Hell,"...And hell is hot much like this posthumus effort by Biggie. This album is by no means a classic. There's a lot of throw away tracks and the production to some of his most quotable lyric is not good at all. Biggie has some pretty dark and honest songs on this that are both deep and believable but most of these are little too poppy and geared towards the general masses instead him just being him. Biggie lacks some of the wit, charm, and clever word play that he had on Ready to Die.The highlights of this album are (In My Opinion):1(1) Somebody's Gotta Die(3) Hypnotize(7) I Love the Dough(11) Niggas Bleed(12) I Got a Story to Tell2(1) Notorious Thugs(2) Miss U(5) Ten Crack Commandments(8) Sky's the Limit(9) World Is Filled...(10) My Downfalland the last track You're Nobody Til Somebody Kills U"
5,Classic,"I dont know which is better Ready to Die or Life After Death but i do know that both are in the top 15 of hip hop records and in the top 100 of music recordsFavorite Track:AllGuests:R.Kelly,Lil Kim,112,Dj Premier,Easy Mo Bee,Too $hort,Puff Daddy,Ma$e10 of 10 lyrics 10 of 10 beats"
1,what i think about this c.d.,"about this being the greatest double c.d. and all that other [stuff], ""all eyez on me"" was and still is the greatest double album and in fact album period. i only like ""notorious thugs"" in this whole album, westcoast for like man, 2pac is still ballin homies."
2,scratched up,I love this album and didnt even care that the cover was all tore up. What really upset me is that the album was not only scratched but dirty and greasy!
1,B.I.G will never match 2pac.,"Besides no money no problem, this CD is horrible, the Notorious is simply not comparable to 2PAC. Rest In Peace to both of them."
1,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!,"I KNOW ALOT OF YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO HEAR THIS BUT B.I.G IS A COMMERCIZED PUPPET WITH MINIMAL LYRICAL SKILL. IS WHOLE STYLE IS BASED ON RAPPIN OVER JIGGY SAMPLES. WE HAVE HIM TO THANK FOR THE GLAMOUR HIP POP TREND THATS TAKING OVER RIGHT NOW.JUST BECAUSE HE DIED DOESN'T MAKE HIM THE BEST, NOT EVEN ONE OF THEM."
5,"Great Album, before rap went to hell","Biggie smallz was a great mc, he had such a distinct flow, its a shame rap sucks ass nowadays."
4,Tha Notorious - R.I.P,"Biggie album Life After Death is a classic!! A must get 4 all hip hop fanz who know real hiphop when they hear it.. Biggie and Pac were the very best and the game just aint tha same.Personally, i must say i'm a bigger 2Pac fan, howeva, i'm not taking anything away from BIG. The truth is it doesn't matter who u prefer or who u think is better, because they both were the best in their own way. BIGGIE had more rythm and flow than Pac, but Pac's music was more political, deeper and socially conscious.Anyways, the album is a classic especially hypotnise..Hiphop will forever be blessed because of BIG and Pac and their memory will live forever especially with albums such as this.R.I.P - One Love One Nation!!"
5,Well done,"An excellent album, plenty of good songs to bump to (especially with a nice car system). A lot of BIG's classics come right off this album.This album could almost be classified as a BIG's greatest hits CD. (Notorious thugs is one of the best rap songs of all time!!!)Definitely check this CD out."
4,big was ready to die and this was his darkest work,"this whole album speaks death, it's like big and puff was worshipping the death gods by saying come get big, puff saying I don't wanna die on what's beef was very touching but you know puff was'nt scared then or now, a few diss songs we know big was talking about pac in a few verses and then he dissed nas, and wu tang all the tracks arte death influenced. on some unreleased verses on hypnotize you can hear big say f 2pac I heaerd it believe you can also check the underground mixtapes where puff curse and diss 2pac if you look hard enough. anyway rest in peace pac, big, big stretch, kadafe, orlando anderson and all the other g's who gave their lives for hip hop."

2,Life after death ?,"Biggie had a good Flow but the lyrics are bad .Songs as Hypnotize,I love the Dough,Nasty Boy are great .But the other songs are not so good.....Biggie wasn't the best Mc in New York.<Nas and Jay-z are better"
2,"Not As Good As ""Ready To Die""","This album is not as good as ""Ready To Die"". The only good songs on this album are ""Notorious Thugs"", ""Long Kiss Goodnight"", and ""You're Nobody Til' Somebody Kills You"". The rest are a little off and have too much samples. If you don't have this album, then don't get it. You can borrow it from a friend and record the songs you like off it. But don't waste... on it. If you don't have ""Ready To Die"", than buy it. But don't buy this one.P.S. That East Vs. West bulls--t is old, I liked both 2Pac and B.I.G. So please quit dissing Biggie, DMX, or any of the Eastcoast Hardcore-Rappers. But you can diss Puffy, Mobb Deep, Jay-Z or Lil'Kim all you want because they can't Rap.R.I.P. 2Pac, B.I.G. and Eazy-E. See you three at the crossroads. PEACE."
4,A Great Buy,"I have the 27 inch version of Sylvania's TV/DVD/VCR. It has a wonderful picture, and it is VCR program friendly. The sound is very radio-like (not enough bass), however, it sounds standard for a TV. For stereo sound you'd have to connect it to your home stereo. What they don't tell you in the advertisements is that it has a sleep timer! You can set the TV to shut of in 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes. This is great for people who fall asleep with the TV on. On the downside, the VCR plays loudly in comparison to how quiet the DVD player runs. It is also a very heavy TV-mine weighs 98 lbs. I paid under [money] for my set in November 2002; it was worth it. I plan to keep this set forever."
5,Very entertaining!,"Initially I picked this book up on the strength of the wonderful photographs by Michael James O'Brien. However it was the broad scope of Holly Brubach's look at the phenomenon of drag in different cultures and the depth of her observations about gender, which ultimately delighted me.Ms. Brubach writes with a keen eye and ear for ironic details. Her expertise in the field of fashion and the arts gives her a unique perspective from which to write about drag, but if you think this subject superficial prepare to be surprised. Her humor, necessary to exploring such a subject, often had me laughing out loud. Highly recommended!"
3,"High quality inks, for an exorbitant price","The quality of the inks is good. I can get colorful, attractive brochures, and the better the paper, the more vivid the colors look. The cartridge is very easy to install, doesn't leak on the print heads, and is durable.The only problem I have with the cartridges is the unbelievable price for the inks. I got a great deal from the vendor I bought from, but HP is still insanely priced, and with Lexmark turning out cartridges for five clams a shot, it's hard to justify the shelling out of 18-20 clams for HP's small cartridges. You'll of course pay much more for HP's XL.Plus, since HP's support is even worse than Dell's, I won't be buying another HP anything nor will I be paying this price for ink anymore. The only reason I got an HP was for the linux-friendly drivers.But yes. The cartridge is quality, simple to use, and durable. And it won't leak on your printheads. So, if you're stuck with HP, you'll at least get good ink."
4,"Culinary historians, take note!","This is a wonderful piece of scholarship, with a practical purpose. To my knowledge, this is a group of some of the earliest recipes ever translated. I have Apicius, and have done some of the recipes in it, but this takes culinary history back at least 1000 years earlier, and shows some fascinating parallels with both Middle Eastern/Persian cooking and Chinese. My only regrets or complaints are that we still do not know the translation behind some of the ingredients, which makes it difficult to actually try them, and that the clay tablets were damaged in places, which makes the list of ingredients incomplete in places. But the avenue of research is fascinating, and holds some real interesting keys to later cooking styles.A must-have if culinary history interests you!"
1,ODIGGITY-DOG,THE HERO WAS TOO MUCH OF A MAMA'S BOY. BELIEVING WHAT HIS MOTHER TELLS HIM AND GETTING UPSET WITHOUT FIRST CONFRONTING THE SO CALL WOMEN HE LOVES FIRST. THIS BOOK WAS MAKING ME SICK WITH ALL THE CLINGING HE WAS DOING AND DOING THINGS TO STAY WITH HER BUT NOT TRUSTING HER AND THEN TURNING AROUND TO TRUST HER AGAIN. I HEAR THERE IS A SEQUEL AND I WOULD NOT WASTE MY TIME ON THAT ONE EITHER. I WAS REALLY DISSAPOINTED. I CAN'T STAND MAMA'S BOY WHO DO EVERYTHING THERE MOTHER TELLS THEM NO MATTER WHAT AND ALWAYS CHOOSING THEM OVER THE WOMEN THEY WANT AS THEIR WIFE.
2,just an okay book,"After reading all of the reviews, I went out and bought this book. Boy was I disappointed. At the end of the book, the reader still did not know who bought up all of the stock. It was nice that the 2 characters ended up happily married; however, I felt like the read was a waste of time."
1,Poor quality,Two months after installing the frames on my car they are pitting. In addition two of the six black letters have also fallen out of the frame.
3,Blitzkonducting,"This recording of Otello, although great otherwise, suffers from the heavy hand of Karajan. Karajan (and one either loves this or hates this) conducts his orchestras to make much louder and faster recodings than are usual. If you are looking at a Karajan Otello, I suppose you are one of his proponents.Karajan's grandiose style does wonders to deepen and enliven timid and lighthearted works. For example he is marvelous with Mozart; I love the Karajan Zauberflote and Requiem. However, Otello is neither a timid nor a lighthearted work. Verdi and Karajan both produce delightful but overstated music. Putting them tgether just makes an unsubtle and overloud recording."
5,Brilliant,Great recording all round of Verdi's most profound opera.Chief singers are great -- I find del Monaco and Domingo the best Otellos.Sound very good for early 60s.
2,Poor reprint of a great book,"It was very disappointing to find all the diagrams which made the original such a great book being reduced to thumbnail size. As a consequence the legibility is basically zero.Additionally, the page format is -in my opinion- a bit to wide which makes it harder to read"
4,Never get tired of Betty Neels Books,"Betty Neels books are always fun to read, good stories and not too heavy. I liked this book especially, it was nice to read on a cool fall day."
2,Not nearly as good as I expected,"While it's a legitimate interpretive technique to emphasize a downbeat by delaying it slightly, I find it extremely distracting that Ashkenazy does this automatically and mechanically, over and over, in the opening movement of the Moonlight Sonata. Not really an appropriate kind of accent for this movement, and he fails to use other ways to emote, like building or contrasting dynamics, ritardando, etc.Altogether bland and disappointing enough that I'm looking to buy a replacement and consider the money spent already to be nearly wasted. 2 stars only because it could be worse . . . this is Ashkenazy, of course."
3,"If You Listen to the Alfred Brendel, You Won't Want This One","Nothing wrong with it, mind you. It just doesn't have the grit, the intellectual muscle (and the rhythmic urgency) that one finds in the Brendel recordings. A great Waldstein, though!"
2,missing frame... then when frame came it was a joke.,"I bought this for my husband so we could have some of our hometown in our new house. When the package arrived there was not a frame. I contacted the seller and they sent out one that did not even remotely contain the photo. Now, I have to buy a second frame. This is crazy. The picture itself is beautiful, but other than that I can not give more than 2 stars!"
5,Great picture!,I love this picture... the quality is also good.I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a picture of Chicago.
1,Bad,"I am sure once this product gets to me it will be wonderful. However, 10 days and my item still has not shipped? That is ridiculous. I would have paid a lot less money if I knew it would have taken this long."
1,absolutely terrible....,these girls can't sing...can't dance... and their music is so annoying and degrading! and yet they're performing at reading...and right before slipknot too hahaha slipknot's gonna like eat them or something. well this song is HORRIBLE...DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
1,"Pathetic, ludicrous .... ( why don't i just review it 4 u)","This C.D should be given the title of worst all-time record ever. It is totally stupid. These chicks have no talent anyway. WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY DOING IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY?! All i can do is beg you to not make the biggest mistake of your life by buying 'ooh stick you'. Anyone who likes it obviously has no class whatsoever or self-respect for that matter. They probably get hideous clothes too (like their idol's Daphne and Celeste).These idiots should also stop critising Christina Aguilera. Christina has an amazing voice,is pretty, can dance very well and dresses brilliantly unlike the hideous twins who dress and look like tramps. Thankyou for reading and for your own sake don't touch their C.D. Listen to Jagged Edge, Kelly Price and other real singers."
2,Brace Youselves,"If you thought S Club 7 or Cleopatra were juvenile, well then you've never heard Dapne & Celeste. This song is basically targeted at the children demographics. Its not hard to see why with the ""cute"" lyrics and awful mocking of people who they hate. Unfortunately, it doesn't offer anything more. A disappointing single."
1,I wish I could give it zero!,"In the name of god, who is the evil satanic figure behind this terrible piece of trash! If you have any mercy, MAKE IT STOP! It's unoriginal, stupid, juvenile.... [add appropriate insults in the space provided]... and I hate it. If you are in any way a music fan, don't buy this... it may put you off forever...."
1,Worse than Macy gray!,"Ooh stick you is not a song. I have to say i definetly agree with the reviewer who said it was intended to be made for children, but will children like it! No they won't! Children like music they can sing along to, like Britney Spears. * THEY DON'T LIKE WATCHING THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW! * Ooh stick you is basically an argument between two girls! I HATE THE 'SONG' OOH STICK YOU- IT IS SO BORING! Geez i wish i had my own record company- if i did i'd make sure that no talent hacks like Celeste and that other girl who SURE KNOWS HOW TO GET ON MY NERVES wouldn't get signed and make sure that talented singers like Joe, R.Kelly, Monica, Deborah Cox etc did. I don't take myself too seriously but i take music seriously. It is not a joke- music is supposed to be pleasent to listen to NOT GIVE YOU AN EAR ACHE! If i ever meet the wreched twins (no i don't want to) i'd give them a piece of my mind- it wouldn't be pretty, trust me!"
1,U.G.L.Y Music!,"The song ""Ooh stick you"" is not humourous at all. In fact it is really offensive and has no vibe to it. People who don't like the song are not narrow minded but are interested in singers who are talented. I HATE THE LYRICS- THEY MAKE ME WANT TO THROW UP!I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF MUSIC BECAUSE THIS IS THE WORST SONG EVER! I'd rather watch paint dry that listen to this boring nonsense along the lines of 'sesame street' and 'coconut'. Lastly N' Sync are not manufactured teeny boppers, they are talented (i've heard them live!)"
1,Must have come broken,"I ordered this based on the part in a lamp. Our electrician put the part in, and the lamp didn't work. I took the lamp to a hardware store where their electrician checked out the lamp and the part. The part was declared not working. I am not sure where the receipt is and don't know if it was returnable anyway since it is an electrical device. Both electricians did read the print out I gave them about how one can't just match color to color for installation. Another gentleman ordered a different brand for the part, installed it and now the lamp works."
2,Worked great for a few months...,"Slightly complicated to install. You need a continuity tester to determine the hot and neutral lines from both the plug and the socket.Pleased that it is rated to handle 200 watt bulbs, which is a lot more than the 60 watts my old failed unit could handle.Four light levels: 10%, 20%, 60% and 100% brightness.Mine is silent; the instructions note that long-life bulbs and lower wattage bulbs are less likely to make noise.UPDATE after less than a year, this thing has started turning the light on and off by itself, and changing brightness levels randomly, so it is useless. Will try to get a replacement."
3,Have someone who knows what they're doing,"The first time I wired in this replacement switch I could only get one of four bulbs to light. After numerous other attempts to wire it according to the enclosed instructions I only succeeded in not getting it to work at all. I ended up buying a new one somewhere else and had my Engineer son install it. If you can't read an electrical schematic and don't know much about wiring, just buy a new lamp."
5,Easy to install,"My husband is normally the ones that fixes everything electronic in our home, however, I decided to follow in his footsteps and try and see if I can replace the Touch Lamp Kit AR135D and I was amazed of how easy it was, it took me maybe 15 minutes been I've never done this before, I am sure it would have taken my husband 5 minutes. But it worked and I now have 4 settings instead of the original three, cool.There is nothing you cannot find in Amazon..Thank you."
5,Excellent kit,I worried after I found out the size was too big. I prepared to return it before I received.Amazon posted the package size not the actual Touch Dimmer Kit size.What a relief when I oped the box.It fitted very well under the lamp base and it was easy to connect.The insert has pictures how to connect red and black wire well.I saved a lot of money because I do not have to buy an another lamp.Thank you.
5,Works just as described!!!,"I really didnt know what to expect. But once it came in, the instructions were very clear. specially the diagram. spend some time reading the instructions and looking at the diagram before you start off cutting wires to install. Also, the small hook with the yellow wire was not wide enough to slip over my metal hollow screw (from which the wires from top were coming). So I just cut the loop from the yellow wire and attached the wire directly to the washer beneath the nut bolt. So that worked perfect."
4,Replacement Part,"I used this to fix our touch lamp that wasn't working, not to convert a lamp. You will need to be sure that if you are converting a lamp you have a large open lamp pole or that you can fit the module in the base.With the wires coming out of the side instead of the top or bottom skinnier sides, it was much harder to fit in our lamp then the old one coming out.I love that its now fixed as I was missing my touch lamp. Much easier and quicker then turning the knob."
5,Simple replacement,"Not a lot to say about this unit. It works. The instructions were fine, and swapping it for the faulty touch dimmer took just a couple of minutes, all the parts were included in the kit.If you are buying one as a replacement unit check the dimensions before ordering. This was the second we touch dimmer purchased - the first was too big to fit in the lamp base."
1,doesnt work,"this item didnt work, a defect, will cost me more to send back. I wont buy another electronic item, touch lamp still doesnt work,"
2,didn't work for me,"wiring did not match, tried to get ti to work - too hard to follow , ended up in the trash"
2,Lasted 4 months,"This worked great, four levels of light. too bad when a lamp went out so did the dimmer. Time to look for a different brand."
5,"Works great and is tiny, but side exit wires are an issue if used as a replacement.","I bought this to replace a burned out touch sensor in a nice lamp I have. It was about the same physical size as this item, as it was the smallest one I could find, but the side exit of the wires made it difficult to use inside the tube of my lamp where the old one was mounted. I just disassembled it and moved the wire exit to a few new holes I made and it is perfect. The 4 settings are nice instead of 3 like most. Great replacement touch sensor after I made it fit."
3,fix it,make sure you read instructions and watch color coding on wires double check and you will be surprised on the money you saved by doinit your self. wire nuts were super cheapos had to get my own---took extra time --what a pain--over priced--shipping charge crazy for this little-small item
5,works exactly as advertised,"I installed this touch lamp kit into a china cabinet to operate the light by touching the hinge of the cabinet door. Works perfectly.It has 4 brightness levels. at your first touch it comes on very dim, 2nd little brighter, 3rd little brighter, 4th 100% light, and 5th touch turns it off."
2,Ok,Service was very good but I purchased a number of these (10) and one of them didn't work. It was replaced without a problem but I do have concerns for the longevity for this product. I worry they won't last very long and will probably get a different brand next time.
3,Im a hairdresser & have owned it for a 1 1/2..and it works fine..,"Ive had this blow dryer for about a 1 1/2 and it still works fine. Im not a fan personally: I would like if it weighed a little less, Im a hairdresser and on my feet all day. The cord is short, maybe its a long enough for personal use, not in a salon! It gets the job done, but Ive learned to research a little harder in the future."
2,Expired Ink; Not XL,"I'm torn. It is ink. It is cheap. And it arrived quickly.However...it is expired ink, which sends HP printers (at least my OfficeJet Pro L7680) in to a hyperventilating tizzy every time I want to print. It takes me 4-5 menu-navigating button pushes every time I print, during which the printer repeatedly protests that my override is voiding any HP warranty. Nice touch, HP. Once I get through that, though, the print quality is fine.Additionally, instead of 1 88XL, I received 2 regular-sized 88 cartridges. Not the end of the world. But not as advertised.So...overall...it's ink. It's cheap. It works...sort of. But it is a big pain in the backside to use."
1,"Not as advertised. No ""Retail Packaging"".","Item advertised as ""Retail Packaging"" but the cartridge was missing the HP outer box with barcode (as pictured). Impossible to determine the cartridge's origin or expiration date. Buyer beware."
1,can't get this to work properly,"My HP L7590 is only a few months old and after replacing the cartridges that came with the initial purchase the new HP black ink cartridge is not working properly. I primt test pages with no black ink. There are no ""out of ink"" warnings. Then randomly it happens to print in black and sometimes each page is lighter than the first. I tried printing on ""best"" quality to ""push"" more ink through the cartridge....... unhappy customer"
5,"Great Product, worked flawlessly!","Item arrived quickly and printer recognized it right away, very pleased with product and transaction."
5,"Fresh Ink, Quick Shipping from Amazon","I received my 88XL black ink from Amazon (ships & sold directly from Amazon). The HP 88XL box is new and the expiration date is December 2011, so this is definitely fresh ink, unlike the other reviewer who says the ink they received had already expired (are you sure you ordered this from Amazon, or was it one of their ""other buying choices?"").Very good price, fresh inventory, free and fast shipping - usually what I can expect from Amazon.This is my first 88XL cartridge, and I've heard from multiple sources that you get significantly more use out of the 88XL vs the regular 88 black."
4,Black Ink Cartridge,The black ink cartridge purchased served its purpose and delivered a satisfactory result. The price was extremely reasonable for the HP 88XL Black Officejet Ink Cartridge.
2,Ran out real fast,"This looked like a good deal and shipping was fast. But the cartridge has now run out of ink and I will need to replace it. Since I bought it in March and probably printed fewer than 500 pages on it, I am very disappointed. (I always print on draft setting.) It should have lasted far longer. I am wondering whether I got an expired package or some other less than desirable item.I'm going out now to Office Depot to buy a cartridge I can examine before I purchase it."
2,NOT in retail packaging,"This item did not arrive in the box as described, but in the inner bag only. It appeared to have been damaged in shipping despite padding. I've purchased these cartridges elsewhere for years and have never seen them without the box. However, the seller did promptly refund the full amount of the purchase."
1,not acceptable,"Ink cartridge arrived already opened. The outer packaging was fine but the product's carton had been opened and even the inner foil package was opened. That's not acceptable. When I printed out the return label, it indicated that I have to pay the return postage. I will never buy ink from GO-DPS again."
1,A quien le le ocurrió cambiar el sonido?,"Si no quieren volverse locos con el sonido, no compren este DVD. Le eliminaron el sonido original, ni siquiera sale el tema de la Telenovela. Los dialogos casi no se entienden por la música de fondo tan espantosa que le pusieron. Una pena, porque yo compré este DVD con mucha ilusión, esta es una de las telenovelas mas preciosas que han podido grabar."
1,La calidad del audio es horrible...,"¡La calidad del audio es horrible! Yo sólo compraría este DVD si puede leer los labios. Cuando mi hijo de dos años de edad diría: ¡""Ay chihuaua""!"
5,Mundo de Juguete DVD,"Esta telenovela es una belleza, pero la horrible música que le colocan en la presentación y en las escenas le quita calidad al producto, es relamente PÉSIMA la idea de Televisa de quitar las canciones originales de las novelas para su edición en DVD. En cuanto a la novela, estuvo excelente el resumen."
4,"balsa, balsa, balsa","Waiting for that great new invention: unbreakable balsa wood. The planes were great, but only lasted a day as usual."
2,"Toy is as expected, just don't get from Hobby Warehouse 1","It's a balsa plane, as expected. My kid and I have a lot of fun with these. Hobby Warehouse 1 (who we got it from) is a rip off. Their descriptions are misleading into making you think your getting more than you will. It lists these planes as $125.00 a twin pack!!! Buy the plane, just not from Hobby Warehouse 1."
5,This is the bst thing since sliced bread!,"This cd is the best thing that has ever happened and i hope that everyone gets it! His music is true deep and meaningful you just have to understand it, believe me i do."
5,Get this Doll !!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loooooooooove this doll she's soooooooooooooooo pretty , fun trendy and cool so you should realy buy this toy"
4,Is episode 5 far enough to judge?,"Right. Because that's how far I am. I think the plot for this show is great, and most of the fight scenes are conducted very well. The art is great too. Although, there are a few things I don't like. For example, although the music is very pretty, (I'm a huge Yuki Kajiura fan, look up some of her CD's) they seem to use the same 5 or 6 songs over and over. It wouldn't hurt Yuki to write a few more for the show. Also, the English dubbing is a little sloppy, what their saying doesn't even remotely match up with the mouths. Now, I know that's hard sometimes, but I've seen it done better.Now that I'm done critisizing it, let me just say this: .hack, how ever strange a title it is, is a magnificent show with a wonderful plot and some awsome characters. I have to stop now though, because I'm running out of synonyms for cool. But I will end on this: You won't regret buying this show, either disk by disk or in bulk like this."
5,awsome boxed set one of the best that i have seen,"this boxed set is awsome it has at least 4+ episodes on each disk tons of cool extras such as back ground information,story time line, textless opining and closing songs which are awsome i ammost pleased with the sound tracks of this series the story of this series is amazing it keeps u wanting know more but it is so uniqe that u will either love it or hate it I give this a 5 out of 5 i highly recommend this set to any one who loves the mmorpg genre check it out!!!!!"
3,"Okay, worth the price but there is much better anime out there...","The Pros:- If you play MMORPGs, it's definitely an entwining, relevant story.- If you don't play MMORPG's, you can still catch enough information to let you understand what is going on for the most part.- Beautiful music, especially Yuki Kajiura's ""Key of the Twilight.""- Interesting enough storyline.- Those Grunties are so darn cute.- Good price, now that it has gone down significantly due to its age, other .hack series releasing, and popularity.The Cons:- The drawing style wasn't the best I've seen.- They often use music inappropriate to the scene, which can ruin the mood (like playing ""Key of the Twilight"" during a fight scene).- If you don't play video games or have never played an MMORPG, there is a lot of information you probably won't understand, like why some of the players have the roles that they do.- You have to play the video games to see the complete ending. I personally have all of the games but not everyone does."
4,Great Confusing TV Show.,".hack//sign is a great show. But I'm the only one I know that likes it. It has great music and preety neat art. The fighting stinks and If you don't start from the begining you be lost in the show for a while. That's me, I started at #4. In conclusion its a great confusing tv show."
2,After the 1st episode....,this anime seems indifferent to me. It should be better to play lineage or something than whatch an anime who deals with characters in a online game. Can't say bad or good only that it doesn't interest me into watching the whole series...too childish maybe
4,Warning...This version is missing something,"I loved the story of this anime up until the very ending...when something seemed incomplete...at first I thought it was another great anime with a very crappy ending...kind of like Evangelion...but I was wrong...this version is missing the complete edition...there are 28 episodes to the series and this one only has up to the 27th(including the ones in the extras)...the final episode the 28th...is the most important...""Reunion"" wraps it up folks and like many crappy American versions of good Anime, this on falls short...so in short, unless you can get a complete import, don't get this one, you'll probably be just as disappointed in the ending as I was."
2,too sticky,"This product feels gooey and sticky on my lips, It's very glossy, but doesn't plump much at all. I am not impressed."
2,lip injection,"The lip injection is a waste of money. It does not work like promised to plump your lips, it only tingles a bit and gives you shine, but that's it. by the 2nd day of use it did not even tingle my lips and saw no plumping or fullness. DISAPOINTING!"
1,Be Careful,"I purchased this after I saw a recommendation on Dr. Oz's show. Immediately, upon applying this, not only did my lips turn red, but my jaw line turned red; my neck became blotchy red; and the tip of my nose turned red. I was scared, but wondered if it was my imagination that it was as awful as I thought. I waited ten minutes and went downstairs. My granddaughter said, ""Grandma! What did you do???"" So, approach this with caution. My lips did turn red but I didn't think they looked very plump. I did give this another try a few days later and the reaction was less severe. Be careful if you try this. Good luck to you."
3,Wears off too fast...,"The lip plumper works for a few minutes, my lips turned a nice color of ""flush"" and the gloss is shiny. But I was not impressed with how long the effect lasts, which is only a few minutes. I also noticed that the gloss will ""bleed"" into the cracks of my lips. Granted I am an older woman with the cracks around my lips but usually gloss does not bleed into them like this one does. In general not impressed with this product. It does not plump to the extent I was expecting. Oh...and the shipping cost was nearly as much as the product!"
2,Plump lips,According to a doctor on the Dr.Oz Show this is the closes to having cologen injections to plump up your lips. Not true I saw zero difference. Your lips burn some what because of the capsium in the gel but no plumping.
2,Cosmetic Lip Injection,I consider this item to be nothing more than a lip gloss. Save your money and just purchase a lip gloss for one fourth the cost.
2,Costs hidden,"Not sure about the product yet, been just 3 days, I see no difference in my lips. I ordered from. Halfpriceperfumes.co.uk through Amazon.the product was $6.58 good, Tax $1.32, Shipping $4.99So for a little $6.58 product I was charged $12.89. If this really works, I guess it will be worth it, so far I don't see any change at all. Does sting for about 10 minutes, no big deal-I hope it works but doubtful. Dr. Oz recommended. I am finding he is not researching the products he recommends as much as he says he does."
1,Don't buy,I bought this product thinking it would work like other lip plumpers I've gotten in the past and it made my mouth breakout in a rash. Hubby and I got a good laugh over it - but never used it again (for obvious reasons)... FYI - The rash disappeared after a few hours.
1,unbelievably horrible,i didnt even get the product. i got the box with absolutely nothing in it. never ever ever ever ever again
1,Don't waste your money.,"The stinging wasn't bad at all, but the results are entirely minimal and kind of silly. You'll just look like a five year old whose parents haven't taught them how to put on chapstick during the winter season. Or, like you have a cranberry juice mustache. This product is ridiculous. Save your money for a lip injection if you're that worried about the size of you dumb lips."
3,3 stars for value only.,"As an Amazon buyer, you may choose to buy this CD of just the Ninth for $16.98, or the 2-disk set of three ""great"" Dvorak symphonies with the Cleveland Orchestra/Dohnanyi (same performance of the Ninth) for $11.97."
1,UNBELIEVABLE!,Anyone who pays this much for a book that contains information readily available on the Internet or in other great books costing less than $30.00 is really foolish. You DO NOT get what you pay for in this case.
1,Wow,Are you kidding me? Either 275 dollars or over 800 dollars for this book? Is this a mistake? Well anyone who is stupid enough to pay that kind of money deserves what they get. Most of this stuff can be found on the internet for free just by looking. I see these reviews and wonder did you really buy the book? OMG LOL
1,Are we that far away from reality?,"I did not and will not purchase this book. Anyone that is that clueless on how to cook is hopeless. $80.00 for a used book? I have enough intellegence to figure out what to do with storage food without spending that kind of money on a used book. If I were that stupid, I at least have the sense to google it."
4,Don't be fooled by a drab CD cover.,Susie's got a great backup band. Songs are well chosen and tastefully interpreted.Only one suggestion for Susie- fire the guy(or gal) who designed the CD cover.
4,Not bad not bad,These books are never perfect. There will allways be something missing. While the book is big (BIG) the sections on each band are quite exahaustive and lengthy so there is still a coverage that is not complete. On the plus side it is well written and contains some great information.
5,A Great Addition to Your Short Fiction Shelf,"I love reading short stories, and finding a new collection of varied and interesting voices is a joy. There are some original and unexpected gems here. The stories are down to earth and accessable and do work to make the reader think about the truth. I was unfamliar with most of these writers and look forward to seeing what they do next, as well as reading the next in the MOTA series."
3,"Aliens beware, Argentosoma is here!","Argentosoma is a competent anime. The animation is done nicely, but the aliens that are fought are not thought out to well. Each alien monster looks exactly alike, with the only differences being various size and slightly different powers so it can get a little boring in parts. The only characters that are giving any depth are a little girl named Hattie and a young man named Takuto. The rest of the ensemble aren't giving much of a back story except for the very last episode that gives some back round on one of the lesser fighters, Sue. The anime drags the first episode but after the second episode things pick up. There are better anime out there but for the price you can't go wrong."
5,THE LAST RIDERS ON ROUTE 66,"This book would be un unreal screenplay! Action, Drama, Humor...with a truly unique & original voice. Bravo!"
3,Last Riders On Route 66,"Take a ride on Rte 66. Two students set out to hitch hike to California during school break. The people they meet and the adventures they have during their trip, describe the attitudes and changes about to happen during the 60s. America was about to enter into a time when the ""flower children"" took center stage, the new music caused controversy, and the nation would be shaken by what was taking place.The author relates his experiences during these changing times, capturing the many different attitudes and faces of those met on the journey.Route 66 was one of the major routes to California during that time, especially during the winter months, and those of us who travelled it, met many of the folks described in this novel. Take a trip with the author and enjoy his narrative of those times. Worth a look into."
3,"Another ""average"" album","I am a big TD fan. Over 100 different cd's/Lp's. I was big on getting this because of the Syd Barrett tie in. I think it is great that they dedicated it to him though the album has nothing to do with him. Every track has vocals(a think which I dislike). The music itself, is good... but the vocals take away from it. The first track is excellent even with vocals...but the rest of the album was average, at best."
4,Book vs. Movie,"Although that's usually true, it is especially so in this case. I actually thought the movie was better, which is rare. The book was also very good, but in a different way. It has the same heart and inspiration as the movie, but it gets a little lost in the side stories. The writing was good, but the storyline jumped from person to person a little too much."
4,A great read!,"Pay it Forward is one of my favourite all time books. I was so annoyed when a saw a reveiw written by a certain person called Steven, whoever he is, who said that Pay it Forward was unrealistic.It is a wonderful book packed with imagination, cliffhangers, humour and even tragedy! The ending had me crying! You get to know the characters so well, that it almost makes you want to scream when anything bad happens to them!"
3,"Love and Being a Good Person ""Should Solve"" Things","I started off loving this book but perhaps hearing about the upcoming movie was a disadvantage. I found myself annoyed with the material changes they made to the story for the movie. Then the book seemed to take off in somewhat of a different direction than I hoped. I thought it was a ""must have"" but by the end I did not recommend it to anyone and I passed on the movie."
2,Read Something Else Instead!!,"""Pay it Forward"" wasn't very good. The story was saccharine sweet and had very unrealistic dialogue. A great example of the horrible dialogue was when Trevor referred to Chelsea Clinton as a ""major babe"". I'm sorry, but I just don't believe that most 13-year-old boys think of Chelsea Clinton as a ""major babe"". Oh, and every other word out of Trevor's mouth was ""cool"". My teacher is cool, my project is cool, Bill Clinton is cool, and every damn thing is cool.Another problem with this book was the love story between two of the main characters. They just didn't seem like they were really in love."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,I did not expect the adult content. I thought the book would be suitable for have an adolescent or preteen and it is not.
3,"If you like this story, try this...","This story reminds me of Magnificent Obsession by Lloyd C Douglas.In that story, a young playboy, Merrick, while drinking too much, has an accident at a lake. The paramedics use the emergency equipment at the lakeside to save his life. Meanwhile, a famous neurosurgeon is at the same lake, but his life is not saved, since the equipment is already in use. When Merrick wakes up, he overhears the nurses saying what a shame that he survived and not the neurosurgeon Dr. Hudson, who has done so much for humanity. This makes him rethink his lifestyle, and do his best to replace the doctor that he deprived of life, and serve his fellow men in his place, partly because Dr. Hudson believed in anonymously helping others enriches and empowers the person who does so.It is an excellent and engrossing read. The book is better than the movie, which stars Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman, mostly because the couple is supposed to be college-age, and Hudson & Wyman are too old."
5,Pay It Forward Book,"I am very impressed with the speed of the delivery concerning the book, and the book itself was amazing!!!! My family also orders things through Amazon and has never had any problems, keep up the good work!! :)"
2,Where's the Beef?,"I had two problems when reading this book. First, several methods of dialogue were terribly inaccurate. At one point, the author attempted to create authentic gangster dialogue for an interview. The word choice was that of a forties gangster, not a 90's gangsta. Several other times word selection reminded me of my mom trying to be ""hip."" The other problem I had with this book was the description. On more than one occasion the writer would build up to a non-existent climax by failing to give the reader sufficient detail. The television broadcast was one of many examples. The ending helped but couldn't salvage this struggling novel."
5,If only it could happen-a haunting novel,"I absolutely loved this book, I couldn't put it down. It may be idealistic, but if it could be true on a small scale, the world would be a better place. You will love the characters. Don't wait for the movie....."
1,"Same Concept as ""Magnificent Obsession"" by Lloyd C Douglas","Good idea for a plotline, but enjoyed the concept more in Douglas' ""Magnificent Obsession"" (1929?) in which old Doc Hudson bestowed favors on people with the condition that it remain a secret and they, in turn, must do something for someone else. Douhglas' sequel, ""Dr Hudson's Secret Journal"" expands on the concept."
4,Good book but forced ending,"Save for the ""hit you below the belt"" ending, I would have giving this book a full ten out of ten. The ending was cheaply melodramatic and just there for shock value. I haven't seen the film though I know enough about it to say that the actors cast for the roles don't look anything like they're described in the book."
4,This was very good...but I hope there's no sequel,"This book reminded me of Joshua by Joseph Girzone; ""paying it forward"" is a simple premise that can change the world one person at a time. I liked the fact that the characters were not two dimensional, but struggled with their own demons. I found it easy to identify with Trevor's struggles and the desire of the adults in his life to encourage and yet protect him.I thought the St. Trevor stuff at the end was a little over the top.My only hope is that the author not fall into the trap of writing ""Pay It Forward II"" and essentially writing the same book over again."
1,Sketchy,"Sketchy and predictable are the first words that come to mind after reading this novel. It's perfect for Hollywood, reads like a screen play. The idea is wonderful! Bravo- but the characters never really get developed in an interesting way, and you can predict what the characters will do before you even turn the page. There are no real fresh surprises here, except the concept, may it take root and thrive!"
5,Are you ready to pay it forward?,"When was the last time any of us did something for someone just for the heck of it? Afeter reading this book in two days, I am very excited about the idea of paying forward to all the wonderful people that had helped me in my life. This ""movement"" could be so real if you and I get together to do so. The book is GREAT, makes you think what you can do next to live in a better world. Trevor is just the creator, now is time to PAY IT FORWARD!"
5,Not to be missed!,"Trevor captured my heart with his innocence and straight forward approach to life. All of us should consider adding ""pay it forward"" to our own lives and improve upon the society in which we live."
5,Pay It Forward: A Novel,"I finished this book in one night because I couldn't put it down. Trevor captured my heart with his simple goodness. I wish ""pay it forward"" could exist in real life."
3,"Great Story, But............","The story itself was very moving. I won't give the end, but I wondered why so sadistic? It seemed like writing a bad ending probably seemed like a good idea, because the author thought it would be more realistic; actually it seemed more contrived and purposely done, than if it was written happily ever after. And I wonder why they chose to use Kevin Spacey, instead of say, Denzel Washington, or the like......... the main character in the book is Afro-American. Go figure."
1,Maudlin,This book was so disappointing. I read a review that said it was inspirational. I found the characters actions to be unrealistic. The ending was totally sappy and unecessary. I knew I was supposed to be sad but I wasn't. I was just disgusted.
3,It's not original,"Sorry to bear the bad news, but there is nothing original in either the concept of this book or the phrase ""pay forward."" A late, well-known football coach used the words ""pay forward"" in teaching a generation of college athletes to do well in the world, and to stretch themselves beyond their playing field accomplishments. He stressed that you can never pay back the people who helped you along in your formative years, so you have an implicit obligation to pay forward. I searched this book for some sort of acknowledgement of this great man's idea and didn't find it. So here is the attribution that should have appeared in the book."
3,This Was Good But Not Great,"""Pay it Forward"" was a decent read. It kept my attention enough to finish it in 2 days, however I feel the characters could have been more developed. I especially would have liked a better portrayal of Arlene. Her character was the best in the book. I would recommend it to others."
5,Should be mandatory in schools,"This book deals with so many issues in out society: poverty, tolerance, racism, class inequality, the importance of education and the old adage ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" Well, you actually CAN judge this book by its cover! Simple yet worthy of attention."
4,To make a difference... or perhaps not...,"I saw this movie years ago, probably right about when everyone else saw it. I think I may have liked the movie better. Of course, it had Kevin Spacey in it. I love him...Anyway, back to the book... I got lost several times in it and had to figure out who was who. Too many characters with too many things going on.Having said that, it was very touching and it makes me want to go out and do random things for people. The big question is... will I?... and therein lies the problem.:)"
5,Pay It Forward,"This book is just awsome, I watched the movie several times and the book is just as good. I would recommand this book to anyone.It is not hard to read, but at certain times the author does jump a bit from one character to another."
3,A Tear Jerker!,I cried my eyes out! An excellent book! To think in a childs eyes that no matter who you are you are accepted. It is a well written book! Very heartwarming!
1,I just can't bring myself to finish it!!!,"The movie is great! The idea is great! The book is... not so great.I bought the book because the community where I live participated in the One Book program, where the entire community is encouraged to read one book. Events were planned, even a lecture and book signing by Ms. Hyde. I was excited.I started reading the book and waited for the author to get into a groove. I waited for the writing to smooth out a little but it didn't happen. I got to chapter four and I just couldn't take it any more. I see why the screenplay writers changed the story so much. The book takes an absolutely fabulous idea and packages it in an unrealistic, contrived, poorly written package.I wanted to give it 5-stars, I wanted it to be 5-star material but it just isn't."
3,Pretty Good for a Teenager,"At the age of 14, I consider reading a punishment, not a thrill. But, while rading this book i came to points where i didn't want to stop reading. That was a first for me. I recommend this book for a teen or young adult. It was good and sad at the end. it teaches you that even one person can change the world."
3,Overly Utopian,"After watching and loving this movie, I immediately ran out and bought the book. However, I found the book to be a disappointment. ""Overly utopian"" is the best way to put it. Sure, the idea of the book is that instead of paying back favors to someone, you pay them forward to three other people. In the movie these favors were relatively believable, but in the book they were outrageous and impossible to go along with. Also, this book was written as a flashback. It starts out with the author telling us the world is perfect, no greed, no hunger, nobody going without, and then tells us how it happened. I'm not usually a pessimist, but that was just a little too hard to swallow. But if you pay no attention to the unbelievableness of it all (The main character, an 11 year old boy actually said, ""Chelsea Clinton is a babe!"" I ask you, is this believable?), this was a sweet book that will make you laugh and cry and it's a quick and easy read."
2,"""Tripe"" may be too strong a word for this book, but","There is one thing to like about this book. The characterization of the scarred teacher is well done, and only HIS thoughts and actions seem probable throughout the book - until the ending. Unfortunately for the reader, the author abuses her position as a fiction writer to preach a social activist agenda through this teacher's mouth. He deserved better. I liked this guy and would invite him to dinner (the character, definitely not the author).The book is already out-dated (in only ten years), partly by the author's naive embrace of Bill Clinton as an idealist and ideal president. The author also perpetuates a world in which characters are motivated by formless altruism. The author's perspective in my opinion is purely socialist.No thanks, I'll take the real world with all its flaws."
1,Stay away from this book.,"Pay it Forward is about a pansy 12-year-old kid named Trevor that came up with a stupid idea to change the world: Pay it Forward. Now I can't hear those three words without cringing. The whole book is filled with one-dimensional characters, lots of smoking, and boring dialogue. Most of the sentences are broken up into fragments. The only thing I learned from this book is that there's such a thing as being too helpful, which affects Trevor greatly towards the end of the book which is also the best part. I'm not gonna give away the outcome, but the only reason to pick up this book is to see what happens to him."
5,Gorgeous portraits of women in nature,"In Natural Dance, Hal Eastman's remarkable photos of women dancers in nature visusally captures their backgrounds as much as their movements, with the individual photos proving especially strong in revealing motion and action. These gorgeous portraits of women in nature will make an especially strong addition to any personal and community library professional photography collecitons."
3,A fair interpretation of these works.,"This is a quite good interpretation of Chopin's nocturnes.Vladimir Ashkenazy's style shows some the trully high level of this musician.Not having to prove his ability as a solist,he takes his time wherever he thinks appropriate and gives a magnificent view of these works.The disadvantage of these two cds is the quality of the sound which is a little flat."
1,Really not worth it,"If you know nothing about computers or have no common sense read this book. If not, do not it's a waste a time. You are better off just googling case studies of internet scamming cases."
5,Kewl CD Single,This is an awesome CD single. If you love Howie then you will love this because track two is absolutely Howie's voice. He is the only one that sings this song. And if you have seen their Homecoming Concert video then you would know this song because Howie sings it for his solo part. Track three is adorable as well. Brian and Nick sing this one mostly. I absolutely love it! :o)
5,It's An Incredible Song,"This song is by far the best song that the Backstreet Boys have ever done. It is a moving and emotional tribute to those who have suffered some sort of loss, whether it be a death of a family member or someone close to you, or the loss of a friendship or significant other. I highly recommend this song to anyone who is a fan of the Backstreet Boys."
5,Must have for US fans,"This CD-Single is an absolute MUST-HAVE for the US fans. We missed out on a very sweet ballad, ""You wrote the book on love"" and this single also has a great song called ""I'll Be There For You"". All fans would love this single but if Nick and Brian are your faves, then you ABSOLUTELY have to have this! Those two songs are perfect for this single w/ ""Show Me The Meaning"", and should be on an album sometime! If you are looking for INCREDIBLE love songs, This is the CD for you! KTBPA!"
3,So so exorcism movie.,"These exorcism movies seem to be all the rage these days. This one is not horrible, but it could have been waaaay better. Oh yeah film production companies, ""You are not ever gonna top The Exorcist so stop trying""."
3,good but too sensible,A fairly plausible moreover sensible British version of The Exorcist I love plausible type horror and this had its demonic effects and moments. But I must be brainwashed by heads whizzing round in circles ontop of necks and long green spumes of vomit. After about 2/3s way through found I was not getting my fix.
4,exorcismus,This is a great horror movie it has a ploit that is good and is misleading like a old time who done it movieand the ending was a ture and beleiveable devil working i like this whole production the actors did a great job and as a collector of horror movies this is a most have for your collection
2,Not my favorite,"Honestly, I bought this movie because the cover looked cool. I guess that's why they say don't judge a book by it's cover, or movie in this case. It wasn't as scary as I thought it was going to be and I got confused around the end. But if you like smart horror movies, this one's for you."
1,Very bad ripoff of the Original,"Probably the worst rip of the original ""Exorcist"" ever. Bad acting, directing, writing and everything else that one needs to make a film. Avoid. Seriously, AVOID."
1,Not worth the money,"I have had success with other Streetwise maps, so I ordered this one. Breaks from one side to another are in bad spots. It has nowhere the detail of the Lonely Planet map that comes with the mini-Sydney book. The free map our hotel and I am sure other hotels give out is much better than the Streetwise map of Sydney. Save your money...you will need it in very expensive Sydney!"
1,"Worthless, Mate!",Don't waste your money. This map shows such a small part of Sydney it is worthless. Using this map is like riding through one of the prettiest cities in the world while looking through a pipe. I threw it away the first day in Australia!
2,Not that great,"Two major dislikes:* The body heat/motion detection is too sensitive to use with as a snooze ""button"".* I am a heavy sleeper and the alarm is waaaaay to quiet to wake me up - this was the reason I had to return it.Also, the front of mine was not assembled correctly at the factory which made the minutes very hard to read.Likes:* The auto-lamp is an excellent idea.* I liked the fact it set the time itself."
4,Snart Clock,My wife got me one of these and I like not having to reprogram it if you loose power etcThe only thing both my wife and I wish the light would go dimmer and what you are allowed to dim it too.
2,My own fault!,"Emerson CKS3088T SmartSet Dual-Alarm Clock Radio with 4-Way Lamp ControlI should have read the description more carefully - with macular degeneration, I can hardly read the ""instruction""IN RED on the face of the clock itself.So I have basically retired it to my guest room. I was pretty disappointed when I realized."
1,"clock did not work out of box, no instruction manual",Clock did not turn on when I plugged it in. Also there was no instruction manual included in the box. Will return and order another and hope it was just a fluke.
4,Clock Radio,"The radio itself is great and it works perfectly, but it must have been stored in a damp place. Not only the packaging, but also the radio itself, has an obnoxious musty and moldy smell. Hopefully that will go away?"
1,When is a mask a skinning?,"During his lifetime, Donald Cordry was a respected collector, a veritable walking encyclopedia on the folk arts of Mexico. His research on Indian costumes is highly respected. Unfortnately, Cordry's mask book, published postumously,is a testament to how even a knowledgible collector can be duped by unscrupulous dealers. Many of the masks represented in the book doubtless are genuine. But many are not. It's a pity, but some of the most skillfully carved and creative masks are, in essence, fake. The state museum of Arizona bought more than 500 of Cordry's masks shortly before his death -- again proving that even the experts can be fooled. This is a gorgeous book. The pictures are great, and the ""masks"" simply breath-taking. Buy and marvel -- but don't believe too much of what you read."
5,Tastes just like the real thing,The recipes in this book taste just like the things that you get at the restaurants themselves. This guy has a great talent for exactly finding the recipes for these great fast-food items
3,"Okay, but not amazing.","I think I just expected too much with this. I've tried 2 or 3 recipes from the book, and they were really good, so no complaints there. There's just a lot of stuff that I've never heard of and/or couldn't imagine wanting to recreate at home. Overall, some good, some bad, but I wish I'd just looked them up online instead of paying for the book."
1,Second book a rip-off!,"I loved the first book. Made lots of great things, especially the Capt. Crunch chicken and many others that were good. This book I expected to be of the same quality. Only 1/2 inch thick and mostly candy-type recipes which require a heavy-duty mixer. Really very lame compared to the first. I won't send it back, but I couldn't find one recipe to make me stop kicking me for ordering this piece of nothing! Don't waste your money. Really silly diagrams that try to take up space, but this is a poor excuse for a book!"
3,My Wife says pass on this one,JUST OK. My wife says to look under COPYCAT RESTAURANT RECIPES or COPYCAT RESTAURANT COOK BOOKS here on Amazon to find a better selection.
4,Obviously a lot of time given to come up with the recipes,"easy to read and understand recipes. I wish there would have been more food establishments recipes oposed to candy, etc."
3,the best cd ever,if u like christian music then this is the band for u. they mix the sound of rock in to the sound of christian music a must have
3,"Good quality, bad fit","The band seems to be of good quality. Unfortunately it did not fit my g-shock watch. The size and everything is correct, but the place between the pin hole and the watch i to thick, so I'm unable to insert the pin with the band into the pin holes in the watch."
3,G-Shock 16mm band,"The price was low, but the band has a plastic buckle and this will not hold up to heavy work. The picture shows a metal buckle, but it is plastic."
5,"Great Product, Greater Price","I've had this Casio G-Shock Water Resistant watch for over 15 years and still works great. I was trying to replace my broken band and the prices I saw at stores, Casio website and other websites were close to or higher than the prices for new similar watches at Amazon.com. I was about to junk my trusted timepiece and replace it with a newer model until I saw the Voguestrap TX16G14 at Amazon.com for $6.95 and I went for it. It fits just like my second replacement strap and should give me 5 to 10 years like my other replacement strap did."
2,flimsy,"It fit, but is very flimsy and thinner than the original. So much so that there is a slight gap between the band and the watch. The gap is very much evident when I bend my wrist."
4,generic casio g-shock band ----,"-just purchased one of these and received it this week. Not bad. About 1/3 the price of a genuine 'Casio' band for this particular watch (DW 5600E). It'sjust SLIGHTLY different in construction than the original band, but does fit, andlooks ok on the watch. Going to give this 4 out of 5 stars."
1,NOT GOOD,I mixed this movie up with the action movie. Not worth the order. I did not get past the first few minutes before I realized I made a mistake.
2,armageddon,"I was expecting a movie not a documentory! nothing in the blurb warns you that this is not a movie. it's all about the proficies of various prophets,i have read nostodemus and think you can read anything you want into his writings. if you like this sort of thing go ahead, just remember it is not a movie!"
1,Bought this by accident,"I was looking for the other movie with the same name. I have already deleted it out of my library, but you know, you can't take back the purchase after you click the button. This is not the movie with Bruce Willis, ok?"
2,Hard to Read and Annoying Alarm,The batman logo on it and the hands all fade together - and so it's of little help and it is hard to tell the time even for us adults.Also the alarm is annoying - my son won't even use it and he's 6 and LOVES Batman.
2,"Orchestra on deck, but singers in the fo'c'sle..",The disparity of presence between the orchestra and the singers is annoying. It sounds as if at the recording session the singers were outside the hall and down the street some distance. Old Gilbert must be whirling in his grave at this one. Either the CD I received is defective or this is one very poor job of studio mixing.
5,The Finest Recording of one of G&S's Finest Operettas,"This is unquestionably the best recording of PINAFORE available today; it, along with THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE and THE MIKADO, are Gilbert and Sullivan's most beloved operas (and for good reason--each is a masterpiece, plain and simple). Every member of the cast on this recording is strong--there isn't a weak link in the bunch, although Thomas Round, John Reed, and Donald Adams are particularly wonderful. Each of the songs are performed exquisitely, especially Josephine's gorgeous arias, Sir Joseph's satirical patter songs, and the charming ""Never Mind the Why and Wherefore"" (the most popular song in the show). Also since all of the dialogue has been included on these discs, the whimsical story of ""love levelling all [social] ranks"" can be followed fully and clearly. This disc has everything that's required to really enjoy H.M.S. PINAFORE, just as it has been enjoyed for over one hundred years."
5,What joy to listen to.,"This is a wonderful production of Pinafore. I still remember summer camp back in the late thirties - I was a skinny young girl and played one of the sailors. Even if I weren't familiar with Gilbert and Sullivan, I would highly recommend this Doylye Carte arrangement. It's major terrific. Sounds lots better than we did."
4,"Good Product, wrong photo","Yes, the photo is all wrong. But the description is correct and the product is fine. It is not a high-end tool, but it works just fine for balancing the carburetors. The ball floats freely and is consistent enough to do the task. The vendor shipped on time and I had no qualms."
2,So So,"I have used items like this before. This is difficult to use on a Jaguar E-type, and the resolution did not seem quite right. For my purposes it wasn't much help."
5,my tiels and canaies love this,"my tiels and canaies love this toy. i got the small for my canaries to play with at the birdie playground, and noticed tiels playing with it too. sm is good for both, but i know they come in medium and may try it as well. sweet toy."
2,A very peculiar recording.,"This is a very strange recording of the Messiah, in particular Solti's interpretation of the chorus parts. For some bizarre reason, nearly every movement is very ""angular"" and clipped. It almost sounds as if the chorus has the hiccups! If you like your ""Messiah"" in the style of a military march this is the one for you! I suspect Solti was trying to achieve a light, bouncy effect but instead the performance comes off sounding very ""mechanical"". There are also some very mannered dynamics which are clear not in the original score and only particular to to Solti (i.e. there are a lot of ""subito pianos"" here and there).I advise you to have a listen BEFORE you spend your hard earned cash on this one.My personal favorite after 20 years is still J.E. Gardiner with the English Baroque Soloists."
2,Sub-par image quality,"Text looks OK on this monitor and it does free up your desk space but the image quality is not good. Graphics seem washed up and fuzzy, not ultra sharp. I recommend that you test this monitor at a store and compare the image quality to others."
4,¡Excelente relacion calidad/precio!,"El monitor Sylvania CL772b es una excelente opcion para las personas que quieran entrar ""por la puerta grande"" en el mundo de las pantallas LCD. Si bien deben existir monitores con prestaciones mas avanzadas que este, no deja de resaltar por su acertada relacion calidad/precio.Solo dos cosas tengo que decir en contra de este producto: Las cornetas incorporadas no tienen un sonido optimo, el cual se torna a veces un poco insoportable al escuchar musica y la guia del usuario que viene con el monitor es demasiado pobre en contenido, ademas de que no se distribuye bien la información relativa al funcionamiento e instalacion.Si buscan una opción economica y de calidad, este monitor no los defraudara."
2,Pretty bad until right before the end,"The book does start out with an interesting premise. An ordinary modern man is shot back to the past through mystical means and wakes up in the body of a young Viking man. Then it goes down hill from there. It is just too pat, too easy.Immediately he is taken under the protection of a powerful master smith. It turns out that he has a modern fighting skill that beats all comers in the ancient world. He immediately finds friends and allies. There is not enough struggle to survive that you would find, if this happened to you. Even his adaptation to his new world is easy and quick.But the last quarter of the book was very interesting. But you have to wade through bad fantasy to find it. I won't reveal it but I will say, it at least made the book not a total waste of time for me."
2,Muted,"There's a muted quality to Ozomatli's Embrace the Chaos that's at odds with these songs of passionate unrest. With Cut Chemist gone, and their hip-hop farmed out, the results are uneven (only the title song escapes unharmed). Ozo don't change song styles mid-tune as often as they once did, transforming with audible effort from hip-hop to cumbia to jazz in a four minute track. Here, then, it's the traditional (for them) Afro-Latin songs that are most enjoyable - the scorching opener ""Pá Lante"", the salsa romp ""Guerrillero"", the swinging ""Sueños en Realidad""."
2,I can't get behind this,"English speaker here, somewhat fan of latin music.A friend of mine saw these folks live and recommended that I go out and buy everything they own right this second.As far as latin music goes, there's nothing special about this album. It sounds like every other salsa record out there. BOOORRRRIIINNNGG!!! Oro Solido was doing this 10 years ago. Who cares???There are some hip hop tracks on this album, and let me save you some time: If you like the crap hip-hop that ozo is trying to peddle on this album, go out and get yourself some black eyed peas. these clowns can't rap to save themselves! It's almost unlistenable. God. I have it playing now, and someone on the album actally rhymed 'half-assed MC's' with something equally as cliched and self important, and, well, crappy. I'm gagging on this album.I'm gonna give their self titled album a shot, it seems to be rather well liked by the amazon reviewers."
1,Not real HIP-HOP,"If your looking for ill lyrics this is not the album u want.....shouldn't be in the HIP-HOP section, more like rock & pop & and latin but not HIP-HOP"
2,not the greatest,"Ozomatli is a great group, esp live, yet the lack of flow on this cd, ruins the vibe. the continuous switch from hip hop to latin, to instrumentals, and the inconsistency of guest mcs forced me to have to sit near the stereo and skip through songs. there are a couple really good tracks but it isnt a cd that you want to listen to the whole way. too scatter brained, too many diferent beats, to leave you feeling satisfied."
4,I miss Chahli! and true fans...,"It's true, this album isn't as good as their first. I truly miss Chahli 2na but I really love the song with ""El Nino"" Poree finally throwing down some rhymes! They still fuse the funk and latin with ease too. I love the Brazilian influence on Suenos en Realidad. That's my new favorite, I think. OH, and for the reviewer from PA down there, TRUE FANS know that it's ""O- ZO- MAT- LI! Ya se fue! Ya se fue!"""
5,Groovin' On,"I've waited a long time for the second album, and was definitely not disappointed. The album will have you grooving for a long time. From it's Latin sounds to Cut Chemist's mixing, it's just a very solid CD. Ozomatli is definitely one of the best and unique groups on the music scene today."
3,"Good sound quality, better options with other directors...","There is some kind of ""get hurry!"" on the Scotish symphony, specially in the first movement, which is a non-grace surprise given the director's reputation.There are some major improvements in the Italian symphony, which is more convincing.The quality of the sound is very good, as we usually expect from Decca (London).The average score (which could be summarized as Scotish 1; Italian 3; Sound Quality 5), in my opinion, has averaged a 3.I am a Solti's fan, but I have to be honest, I was sadly disapointed with the Scotish; I only can imagine Solti being pursued by a monster, or something like that, in a race he ran playing this symphony. There are better choices for this one..."
2,"Solti in the classics is cautious and dull, with spurts of energy","Solti recorded everything in the orchestral repertoire, basically, and where his fiery style didn't apply, he was mostly lost. That's certainly true in these Mendelssohn readings, which replace grace and charm with cautious, routine conducting. There are spurts of fire, as in the finale of the Scotthish, but that, too, misses the mark. There is such lovely Mendelssohn from Karajan, Bernstein, Abbado, and many others that i would skip this one."
5,Very good CD,"Song's 13 - 15 by Bobbie Miller are of note. I looked for something by her in the early 1980's when I read in a rare record volume thatBrian Jones was credited as a guitarist, but no luck. How surprising to find it! ""Every Beat of My Heart"" sounds morelike Keith Richard on Guitar, though.I bought my CD about 1 year ago; funny how the seller stillonly has one left in stock!!"
4,Instrumentals,"This CD is a nice choice to use for relaxing and unwinding. It is also a good choice for those times when you want to be alone with God.Track List:1.Adonai2.Change My Heart Oh God3.God Is In This Place4.Draw Me Close5.I Can Only Imagine6.All The Glory And The Honor7.Grace Alone8.You Have Been Good9.Give Me Jesus10.You Are Good11.El Shaddai12.Praise His Name13.In The Presence Of Jehovah14.Heart Of Worship15.Oh Lord, You're Beautiful16.Surley The Presence Of The Lord Is In This Place"
1,"Not a 4-pack, only one.","There is only one wedge, not 4. Extra words to get to the min. 20 req. by Amazon to allow to post."
3,the magical wishing zombie,"I won't plot spoil - just be careful what you wish for. This is not a FIDO type of humor, and not a SOTD either - but it is a dark humor that has cute and funny moments....apart, from any zombie based humor. In fact, the zombie is background filler and pretty tame till the end, and even then he's far from ANY form of a Romero Zombie. This is a film that if you take it striclty on it's own, was a very nicely done one and well acted - and the female lead is the one that gives you all the laffs. Before you buy, I would rent as for most zombie fans it is pretty tame but the story is good. I only gave it 3 stars as it's more of a social tale that a horror movie, and the cover art on the boz had zip to do, with anything in the film."
5,"""A True Classic""","If you dont have a taste for ""bad movies"" then skip this movie. But if you love movies like Terror Toons, Drainiac(s), Killjoy, Asylum of the dead etc... THIS MOVIE MUST BE IN YOUR LIBRARY. It is one of the best ""Worst"" movies ever created. It is a cinematic failure of catastrophic proportions. Cheesy special effects, unexplainably rediculous lines like, ""Ive seen alot of things in my day, but NEVER have i seen a military instalation full of spiderwebs!"" and so on. This movie is pure comedy from begining to end. On the other hand it is a tad long for some reason but it is shocking from begining to end. Again, realisticly this is not a good movie. But for those of you who love to watch cheesy horror movies (although i wouldent consider this horror) your collection would be lonely without this movie. Absolutely Hilarious."
3,Fans of Ed Wood and other bad movie fans might like it,"This is a low budget shot on digital video movie that is mainly recommended for bad movie fans. The story is simple and the spiders range in size from big to Godzilla type sizes. It has a fast pace and contains cheap gore FX, but there's no nudity; and they used toy models instead of CGI for the scenes where the giant spiders are destroying the city and battling the army. At least it isn't slow and there's gore throughout the film. Bad movie fans might have some fun with it. If you're looking for a well made shot on digital video movie I wouldn't recommend it.The DVD is in very good quality, but it has no commentary or behind the scenes extras."
2,Creepies,"This movie could of been good if the producer could just pin downed what type of special effects they wanted to use. Models, stop-motion animation or CGI. Trying to combine the three the way they did looked terrible."
3,POSSIBLY WORST GIANT SPIDER MOVIE EVER!,"CREEPIES is so unabashedly bad, it falls into the category of prime cut cheese. See...spiders that look like ladybugs decimate corpses; see giant spiders bounce from building to building; see ridiculous miniatures of cars, tanks, etc., getting blown to bits; see giant spider fall on the famous Hollywood sign. The movie is so poorly done it's almost a classic. Add a horrible soundtrack from a group called Wanda and the Marbles; add horrifying performances from all the cast; at least it doesn't drag too much. If you really like cheesy horror films, you'll love CREEPIES and know that there's a CREEPIES 2 coming too!!!"
5,everything I expected,"This case was everything I expected it to be. The case is very good quality, and it seems to take excellent pictures. I've only took some pics w/ it at 30ft at a local ""green water"" lake, and the pictures turned out great. The only flaw with this case is the way the weights to keep the case from floating attaches. It's too easy for the weights to turn and eventually loosen the screw. I lost my set of weights on my very first dive."
5,like an encyclopedia of loss issues,"This is one comprehensive book. Anderson gives people the benefit of 40+ years of his work and comes up with some incredible theories about life on the other side. I read ""The Afterlife Experiments"" which proves Anderson's abilities as a first-rate medium, and I believe what he says on the matters of suicide and evil--two subjects where most mediums seem divided. I like that the sessions were left unvarnished--understanding where Anderson stumbles over himself and why is as fascinating as the readings. All in all a great read."
4,One of his better ones....,"I have read a few other of George Anderson's books and was alittle apprehensive when I found this book,even at a bargain rate. But I have found it to be very light and informative. I have read books by other mediums/psychics and they really make a big deal out of the subject. This does not make crossing over into the light anything more than as easy as a breeze."
5,Giving the gift of hope this Christmas,"This book is the best there is on learning about the other world. I plan on giving it to everyone I know for Christmas. No one knows what it is like to suffer with loss until they find themselves knee deep in it, but this book helps explain in such a great way what the grieving need to know when they have loss. An A+++"
3,Okay,I don't want to write 20 or more words to say this book was ok.I don't like your new review directions.We don't need to be told how many words to write.I am not in school......................
1,"boring, not believable","... this book is not anything other than recycled information that all of the other books by mediums have written many times over. the author doesn't like the word ""readings"" preferring instead the pretentious ""discernments."" which wouldn't be that bad if his ""discernments"" were at all believable. i was amazed at how in reading after reading, he would tell the client the same information almost verbatim. and in these readings there is very little specific information conveyed. he waits until the client confirms a vague question and then gradually ""discerns"" what the true story is and through a hit or miss approach (and there are a lot of misses) he does his thing. avoid this book, by far the least convincing and least interesting of all the books by mediums that i have read. incidentally, i am re-reading ""The Eagle and The Rose"" by Rosemary Altea and i had forgotten how good it is. a much better choice, if you haven't read it."
5,The best book on the afterlife I have ever read!,"After losing my son, George Andersen's books are the only things that have brought any source of peace and hope. I read this one first, and then the other three books written about him. Words cannot describe how wonderful this book was. I just didn't want it to end!"
5,Best book I ever bought.,"I still read this book over and over, I share it with my friends, I take it with me sometimes when I'm going away for a couple days. It is the ultimate ""hope"" book. It even has a chapter about our pets and how they survive death. I'm not easily impressed, but this book is always going to be in my house. It answers questions that I never thought were answerable in this life. But be forewarned, it has some extremely emotional parts, mainly about deceased children, and that is very hard for me to deal with, even though it was a necessary part of the book. On the bright side though, it gives the parents the comfort of knowing that they'll see their children again when they cross over. If you're a skeptic about life after death, this book will change your whole way of thinking."
1,Why repair at this price?,20 dollars for a replacement piece? A new Penguin350 filter is only 10 dollars more. This is a rip off.
5,Great French Folk-Rock,"I started listening to Michel Polnareff in the 1967. It has been years since I had listened to him but I frequently thought of his music and found myself humming some of his refrains. I decided to get a few of his C.D.'s and this is one that I purchased.I LOVE IT!!!! Although one or two that I used to love are no longer my favorites, most of them have the immediacy, melodic and wistful sensibility as they did years ago. I love playing the CD loudly in my car and softly in my home. It is great music to get you going, to exercise to and paradoxically, it is good music for reflection. I speak a little French but you don't need to know the language to appreciate the music. It will remind you of the old days or the days you wished you had lived in."
4,This music takes you away from yourself.,I enjoy how keeping up with the music takes away one's present fears and thoughts. One just can not think whilethis man plays the piano.
2,Schiff is a good middle-of-the-road choice,"The best Well-tempered I and II is arguably Glenn Gould's. His high tempo and take-no-prisoners attitude might not fit all, in which case Schiff is a good second choice."
2,yeah... no,"not only does it not look like anything in the picture, there is no way in .. that you could actually bend your knee while this thing is frozen. i thought this would be something to help with my knee pain after running, but there is no way i can possibly wear this... its too rigid it doesnt conform around the knee like they want you to believe, a waste of money for me. good luck with yours"
1,Bad water flavor - worse customer service.,"This is a great water cooler if you want your water to taste kind of like a mix of chalk and plastic.I thought I got a lemon, but we tried a second hose and a second unit - no dice.What made matters worse was that Soleus has been consistantly weak inthe customer service department. My calls have been met with hang-ups,weeks of silence, and trips to exchange the item to warehouses thatweren't expecting me and weren't stocking the right machine. Boo.I'm not much of a complainer, but this is a bad productand I've been treated like a chump by this company. Be warned."
1,Never even think of buying a Soleus product,"My soleus MW 59's condenser failed within 11 months of purchase. I have yet to see a worse customer service than Soleus. The person responsible is never there and if you leave a message it is never returned. Emails are never answered. I have been struggling for over a month to contact customer service, still did not succeed. Is there a worse rating than 0 say -10 which I can give. I am informing the BBB"
4,Lord Teach Us,This is a really fine overview of the Lord's Prayer. It takes a prayer most of us have memorized and explains in detail what each verse is trying to teach us. It encouraged me while providing practical guidance on how to implement what I learned into my life.
3,The threat is a reality!,"The author seems to think that the threat that some people in the West believe comes from radical Islam is overblown. He does do a good job explaining his arguments in great detail. Chapter 2, ""Islam and the West,"" is a good overview of some problems between the two cultures. I believe anyone interested in this topic would find that chapter pretty fascinating. However, terrorist groups, such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and the PLO; terrorist extremists such as Isama bin Laden; and terrorist states such as Iran, Iraq, and Syria wish for the destruction of Israel and the ""Great Satan"" (U.S.) Therefore, its pretty obvious that radical Islam is a threat to the West. With biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons available on the black market, the threat has only increased."
1,The Answer: Reality,"Another attempt to cast a people into a light that makes them look more palatable to the rest of us, but I think the author only gets halfway there.What really frightens me most about the recent actions being perpetrated across the globe today is the wide range of support they receive from Moslems at the grass roots levels all over the world, even in so-called moderate states like Saudi Arabia (where they're convinced that Israel knocked down the twin towers with a nuclear warhead) and Indonesia (where they think America did). It's the man on the street in Riyadh and Jakarta who scares me more than Saddam does.Sure, Moslems are people, just like anyone else. It's useless to demonize them.But they follow a teaching that REQUIRES the defeat and murder of the rest of us. Sounds like a threat to me. How about you?"
1,Misleading,"The book is undoubtedly misleading because there is no such thing as Christian, Islamic or Jewish threat. To know about Islam please read ""What everyone should know about Islam & Muslims"" by Suzanne Haneef."
4,2 bike hanger,"It's incredible that such an easy and useful hanger is not available in these neck of the woods. I really thank you guys in the USA for providing us develpoing countries with a simple and useful hanging solution for bikes.The hanger itself is perfect, easy to install and does the job of hanging correctly two bikes + additives on the convenient rack, taking little area from the constrained place i have for this purpose.I can only comment on the quality of the plastic wrapping on the hooks, they broke and were useless after the first bike hanging!"
5,bke rack,rack is definitely heavy duty and when installed correctly can hold heavy bikes. install is very easy. looks great in my garage
5,Racor Storage Rack,"Does what its supposed to do... I would buy it again! Durable, Strong, and hold two bikes... Keeps the bikes off the ground so we can park another car in the garage."
3,pale colored stones,"Metalwork is well-constructed, size is perfect for smaller earlobes. However, stones are pale compared with the photo. Stones are tiny as expected (they look flat on side view). I consider it a good buy for $39.99 but would not buy it at a higher price."
2,"perhaps for a little, little girl","These are indeed miniscule. On my pair, the pink tourmaline does not sparkle as shown in the picture. It is dull and waxy in appearance.These might work for a 2 year old. They are gold. At half price, it's a toss up if they are worth the money or not."
4,Only 1 problem,"These earrings arrived in a very timely fashion. Upon going out to the porch to get them, I thought I had ordered much more than just earrings. The box was enormous, considering 1 tiny pair of earrings. In this age of trying to be environmentally conscious, I can't help but think there must be an alternative to this kind of shipping. Please consider some sort of different shipping medium. Other than that, they are beautiful and I can't wait to give them to my granddaughter. Thanks Amazon!14k White Gold Pink Tourmaline Butterfly Earrings"
2,For little girls only,"This pair of earring is too small for anyone but a little girl (5 to 8yr.). It's REALLY small and would look silly on an adult or even a teen. With that said, it's kinda of cute."
3,Track Listing,"Tracks:1) Let's Groove - Earth, Wind and Fire2) Shining Star - The Manhattans3) Keep On Loving You - REO Speedwagon4) Electric Avenue - Eddy Grant5) Sexual Healing - Marvin Gaye6) Total Eclipse of the Heart - Bonnie Tyler7) Rock the Casbah - The Clash8) Open Arms - Journey9) How 'Bout Us - Champaign10) Pac-Man Fever - Buckner and Garcia"
4,4.5 Stars Fine Dickey Betts here,"What you have here is a mix of songs old and new. Under old songs : One Stop Bebop, Change My Way of Livin' and 7 Turns all get redone here in a more acoustic style. On his new version of ""Seven Turns"", it's done very well but there's no Gregg Allman to carry the harmony vocals here. Of the remaining 6 songs, which are new to Betts, the standout is a cover of Bob Dylan's ""Tangled Up In Blue"", which is excellent.The return of Dan Toler is a welcome one and the guitar playing on this disc is first rate. All in all, a very good CD that will no doubt please fans of Dickey Betts and the Allman Brothers Band."
5,One of my most favorite series ever.,"Though, as the person who panned it above notes (without realizing it) it's important to read the whole series. Sharon Green has a habit of leaving mid-series books with a pretty serious downturn at the end, and if you don't see where it goes after that, it can be fairly disturbing. This series in particular starts with the main character as spoiled brat and victim (though she, of course, doesn't think of herself that way) and breaks her in several ways before she finds her own true strength.That aside, this set of five is one that I reread every few months; as you can imagine, my set is getting pretty dog-eared. And it's a must for good powerplay based fiction. I've read nothing else that beats it."
3,Entertaining and not cerebral.,"I recently purchased the book in preparation for a long, boring business trip. Unfortunately, I finished it before I left.This is a story that despite unsophisticated writing, keeps you involved. I had a very hard time putting it down and oftened giggled outloud while reading. Actually, there were times that I could certainly relate to some of the stupid things the heroine gets herself into.My only problem was the continued whipping of the heroine with a switch. After the first couple of times, I found myself skipping over it. Oh well.A fun book to inhale at an airport or bus terminal. Or better yet, in a motel room where nobody can hear your snickering."
5,"Excellent, though hard to accept ""little woman"" slant.","See review of Book 5 for more details. Basically, this story starts off as a selfish female who is more interested in punishing others because she ""can"". It outlines the role she has in her society, wherein she's subject to unquestioned authority on how she lives her life when ""active"" and virtually no restraints when ""disabled"". Deals with some of the same feminist ethics that the Jalav series touches on, but starts out in a much more American culture-specific fashion so that the woman reader is more likely to have some level of empathy and identification with the character in order to compel her to finish the story. By the end of the series, the character is much stronger, more in control of her moralistic viewpoint, and a much more 3-dimensional character whom we care about. Interesting and fun."
5,Yield and Overcome,"I highly recommend this book, this series, and this author to any guy who thinks all militant feminists should be sold into slavery in Afghanistan. You'll love it but I'll warn you upfront, Green will play with your head in ways you probably won't know how to deal with. She's from Brooklyn, she's studied Tai Kwon do, and she's a mother. Women who are extremely insecure feminists will go into book burning hysteria trying to deal with Green so they should probably wimp out. Women who have been in real life abusive relationships with men and had the emotional strength to survive that unfortunate experience tend to be among Green's most admiring fans. Love her or hate her, Sharon Green is in my opinion one of the most unique and interesting authors of the 20th Century."
2,way to sexist - very dissapointing a woman wrote this book,"It is hard to believe a woman wrote this book. The strong heroine is interesting but the leading man is a total jerk and I cannot see why she would want him. I do not see how this could be called erotica or sci-fi. I was very dissapointed in this book as the main theme of the book was ""might is right"". Because he was stronger than her and she could not stop him from beating/raping her or stop the other men he gave her to from beating/raping her, then he felt he was right to do it. This may have been erotica if she had enjoyed it too, but she obviously do not, so it just made him look more of a jerk. Although he did disagree with the female that she was a slave because, acording to him, he only beat her when he had a reason to beat her, whereas a slave got a beating for no reason at all. Understand the difference?"
1,Worse!,"At the beginning I liked the book, but the further the story got, the less I could tolerate it. The book has a strong female character that knows what she wants..at least at the beginning. The highly erotic story, is getting more and more humiliating. In the end the heroine even gives in and agrees, that beeing a female, she is not fit to decide about her live by herself. This was so embarrasing, humiliating and illogical, that I decided right away to put that book into the trash"
1,Vomit in book form,"I read this in college, and, truthfully, I only finished it because I couldn't believe it was so horrible to women (and written by a woman!). I literally was too flabbergasted to not finish it. I had bought this book, the one that follows it and another at the same time, all by this author. I read the second for the same reason and was even further infuriated and disgusted. What a horrible message to send an impressionable mind, archaic thinking and so sexist it was disgusting, not only in how it painted women (and their place in life) but men as well.Horrible!I gave these to a teacher in college as an example of what NOT to write. To this day, Sharon Green is my shining example of the worst in female writers, a disgrace to her gender and her profession."
1,sexist crap,"I haven't reviewed a book on amazon yet but I've bought books based on the good reviews of other people. I bought this book because other readers seemed to love it. So I feel an obligation to warn others so they don't make the same mistake. This book is so sexist it is embarrassing. I can't believe a woman wrote it. Shame on you Sharon Green! And by the way, it is neither good science fiction nor is it good erotica. SKIP IT!"
1,Slime!,I read one of these books years ago and I can't believe they are being re-published. I felt dirty having finished one and have avoided opening a book by Sharon Green since.
4,Portable Office essential,"This battery Kit for the Canon BJC 80/85 is essential if you use one of these printers as I often do, away from a 115VAC power source. Between this on the printer and a battery powered laptop you can do an amazing amount of work from a rowboat!"
1,If Only No Stars Were An Option,"MonaVie is a multilevel marketing scheme with all the overinflated price and unfounded claims one would expect. The juice is a blend of 19 fruits, so who knows if there is even an entire ounce of the acai juice in each bottle. Monarch Health Sciences is certainly not forthcoming with real, meaningful information. Nor do they back up claims with real, meaningful data such as that which might result from a controlled study. Hype and recruitment until the bottom falls off the pyramid, I guess.It also contains allergen information on tree nuts and shell fish.Save your money, get acai powder at Whole Foods, as well as your glucosamine and chronadroitin. It's really saying something that Whole Foods is the better value option!"
4,Not My Kind of Job,"While I enjoyed reading this book and learning about what it is exactly that fact checkers do, and how they do it, I was also made a bit nervous by the amount of detail that fact checkers must check. That's my problem, of course, not theirs: apparently fact checkers love checking facts.The one weakness this book has is that nowhere is the reader given any idea of how long it might take to fact check, say, a 5,000 word article. After reading this book I have no idea whether a fact checker working on an article needs one day, three, four weeks, or more to check an article. Does a fact checker work on several articles at once? It would have been very good for the author to reproduce a double-spaced typed manuscript with a fact checker's notations on each page: this would give the reader a very clear idea of how things work."
3,Interesting but not compelling,"Sean Malone's Gordian Knot projects are always very intriguing. They provide a similar musical approach to much of the ""middle"" period work of King Crimson, with Adrian Belew, Bill Bruford, Tony Levin and of course Robert Fripp. Malone is clearly heavily influenced by this music. Where the first Gordian Knot project was a very compelling instrumental version of this style, this CD falls slightly short by comparison. What strikes me most is that I get tired of listening to each composition about halfway or slightly more than halfway through. It was a nice touch noting the exact point at which each soloist starts and finishes his solos at each point in the song.From a technical standpoint, the CD is awesome, but the compositions need improvement."
3,Tied tight,"3 1/2Falling pleasantly in between Crimson's ambitious crunch and Ozric's sonic jams, GK is one neo-prog outfit not set to intrinsically fail."
3,Tied Up in Knots,"In fairness of all the rave reviews, I felt the need to loosen some of the gordian knots, so to speak. This CD is recommended for those into avante-gard prog, maybe RIO, fusion, or other spin-offs. Good musicianship but low on the melodic count. This was recommended by a fellow progfan (because of Bruford and Hackett's participation) but I have mine up for re-sale now. Not my cup of tea...maybe I like mine sweetened a bit..more in the taste of Yes, Flower Kings, old Spock's Beard, etc."
3,Solid Fripp-style Prog,"This is a solid prog album. Some varied styles and some creative things going on rhythmically. However, it still has a lot of the dreaded cheese factor that a lot of prog suffers from. Some of the keyboard sounds are terrible and makes tracks suffer from the ""wall of sound"" effect. Three stars sounds a little too low, but four stars would certainly be too high. I didn't regret buying this though. It's worth it for the awesomeness that is the last three tracks."
5,Spellbinding,"This book really tugs at your heart strings. Keeps you riveted to the story, waiting for the next chain of events. Lots of action, suspense and drama. I loved it!"
3,"Uneven remastering, but worth it for Tambu tracks!","Not sure what I expected for an import, but the remastering on this release is all over the place--loud and clear on some tracks, too much high end on others, and then some don't seem to be remastered at all (""How Does It Feel"", for example.) But the earlier tracks sound good, and it's nice to have a better version of ""Waiting For Your Love"" until Sony/Legacy finally gets their act together and remasters some of Toto's back cataglog, ideally Toto IV. Since Tambu is now out of print and quite pricey, it's nice to have several tracks from that cd. Overall, a mixed rating for me."
4,"High Interest, Amazing illustrations","Kids will love this novelization of Obi Wan's adventures from Episode III. Novelizations aren't great literature but if you want your child to love to read - especially if you have a boy -- you want to keep his interest. On a side note, the illustrations are amazing. The blurb says the book includes photos but my son loved looking at Tommy Edwards' astonishing, realistic yet fantastical artwork."
3,Not what I thought,"Okay, perhaps I'm an idiot, but I thought this was something for an expectant mommy to help support the tummy. It's not. It's for a newborn, to cover the umbilical stump and it ties with string, not velcro strips. Just wanted to let you know, so you didn't make the same mistake I did. I'm sure the product is fine for what it's intended, but it's definitely not what I thought."
4,I like,Very technical yet readable book. Cohn does a great job in the explanation of integrability. The appendix is very complete and gives you a first hand help on the topics discussed trough out the book. I used the book for Real Analysis and it has been of great help.
4,"Mussogursky's original ""Pictures at an Exhibition""","I never knew that Modest Mussorgusky had never orchestrated ""Pictures"" for thesymphony. His original piano score is absolutely charming and adds greatly to my appreciation of the orchestral score, which is included on the same CD."
1,very disappointed,"I ordered two of these and neither one worked properly. The first one the fan did not run at all, on the second, the fan ran but the mist was not pushed up the vent. I have had Holmes products in the past and this is the first time I have been diappointed in their product. Needless to say I have returned them both."
1,Do not waste your time and money,"We bought this humidifier (not from amazon) when our daughter had a cold. It worked just fine at first, but less than a month later, it quick working completely. Buying this was a complete waste of money since it is now a big paper weight. We are now in the market for a replacement. Hopefully we will have better luck this time."
2,not sure of the durability of this,"I purchased this last winter and it worked great all last winter. It was a bit difficult to fill, because when you turn it over, it won't sit flat, so you have to hold it upright, while filling - not very convenient. My biggest complaint with this is that I just dug this out of the box to set up this year and it won't work. The fan works fine, but no mist. The instructions were of no help, neither was the Holmes website. Of course, this has a warranty of only 1 year!11/19/12 - I need to provide an update for the previous review. I plugged in the humidifier and just let it sit for an hour or so, and when I went back into the room later, it was actually working! It continued to work well all last winter. I have not yet dug it out of the box for this season - need to do that soon- so we'll see if it will work for a third year!"
3,not made to last,"I was initially very pleased with this unit.. we bought two for the house and loved being able to breathe comfortably. Cleaning is still necessary on these units and we noticed a lot of mineral deposits forming. We used some demineralization products that seemed to do well. Over time the black coating begins to flake off the metal contacts, but it doesn't seem to impact the function.. just messy.A year later and the glue holding the metal contacts in place has given out. Of course, since then, I have lost the metal piece and the unit is worthless.I found that it took me about 20 minutes to clean the unit bi-weekly, but soak time of around 2 hours to remove the minerals. That is a pain."
2,Short Term Solution,"We have had this humidifier for 1 1/2 years now. It worked great until we stopped using it for a season, brought it back out when our child had a cold and the gasket that lets water flow from the tank to the holding basin had deteriorated. There are no spare parts available for this unit and now we must throw it away. Such a waste. Don't buy this unit if you want something that will last for more than a year or so."
1,Junk,"I had this humidifier for three months, then it started leaking at the base. The entire contents of the water container leaked all over my floor overnight."
3,Holmes HM 495-UC humidifier,"It appears to humidify well but a puddle of water is on the floor in front of the humidifer and needs to be wiped up 2x daily. Because of this , I would not recommend the product. I have read the troubleshooting part, followed use and cleaning directions but water still settles on the floor. I have it sitting on a cookie sheet on a vinyl floor."
2,Meh...,"I purchased one of these from a store (not Amazon). It works just fine....except that it spews the micromist straight out of the top of the machine which means you need it on a low table or your cieling will get a washing! We had it on a dresser in our bedroom which placed its top at approximately 4 feet fromt the ceiling. You could see the mist hitting the ceiling from that level! My other ""con"" with this model is the closure of the tank. It is a wide mouth opening, but the top only screws in about 1/10 of a turn so it is BY NO MEANS secure. It feels like it will spill open at any second when you fill the tank. But it is quiet and it does last a while on low setting."
5,GREAT humidifier- Really Quiet!,"I've had Holmes humidifiers over the past 10 years and this is my favorite! It's very quiet-good for sleeping. The tank is different from my last which had a handle in the top as well as the bottom. If there's a way to put 2 handles on it that would be great! I like the basic shape of it too. I have it in the living room and it just blended in.I would buy another to replace it, especially with dual tank handles."
1,Does not last,"I purchased this product thinking it would be a great buy because it was filter free. I used it for 3 months, worked great. Brought it back out for this winter season and within a week it died. Motor shot and had to throw away. Would not buy this product again."
1,Terrible!!!,"This product is a waste of money. I've only used it for about 3 weeks when the mist stopped coming out. There is a burnt metallic scent coming from the back of the unit. I've contacted Holmes customer service for some troubleshooting assistance, only to be told to just return the unit to the retailer."
2,You get what you pay for!,"I was excited the first 3 days. Quiet, plenty of mist.Then the next time I turned it on, the clunky fan wheelstarted making loud noises. So now it's no better thana standard humidifier in the noise department. So muchfor ultrasonic. Unfortunately the rest of the machines is cheap.The mist output sometimes isn't constant either.Not sure what happened but it isn't worth the price.Spend the extra money and get a better brand."
4,Does a nice job.,"I have been very pleased with this humidifier. Yes, it would have been better if it would stand alone on a flat surface for filling, but I don't find that to be such a big deal. Turn it over. Place it on a towel so it doesn't slip. Hold with one hand and fill it with the other. Use a gallon of distilled water. Easier to fill from the jug and no mineral powder. Great product for the price."
2,this humidifier is a rip off,"First, I didn't notice any difference in the humidity in my bedroom; a visible mist just shoots up. Then, I found it very hard to clean. There's just a small round hole at the bottom my small hand can barely fit in, to clean it, and all the water never entirely goes out, so I have work a wash cloth around the edges to dry it. The only place I can fill it, is in the bathroom since it is too tall for me to use in the kitchen sink which is closer. I can't fill it up entirely because then it would be too heavy for me to carry into the bedroom where I both sleep and also work.It looks good, but is not worth the price; the cheap one I had before did the same job (maybe better) and was a loteasier to fill and clean, despite the fact that I needed to buy filters. That was the one drawing point with this one."
2,Not silent as advertised,"I use a humidifier in my home office, where I like it to be quiet except for some slight music. I bought this unit from a store, and the box clear said ""Silent Operation"". That was a lie. I expect to not be able to hear something that is silent.I didn't realize until I went home that the humidifier that this was replacing was also a Holmes Ultrasonic product, although a different model. That dampers my hopes, as that one lasted for one winter, and that's it. It has grinding loud gears now. I hope this one is better.On a somewhat positive note, it puts out plenty of mist.If you don't mind the white noise it puts out, and if you don't mind the likelihood that it will work well for one winter, and then that's probably it based on prior Holmes history, then you might be fine."
1,not easy to use,"It is not really easy to fill and clean it; also when you move it little bit it stops giving steam, not recommend to buy."
2,Bad product,"I bought two different ultrasonic humidifiers at the same time ten months ago. For this one, recently, some surface materials of the ultrasonic head (piezo ceramics) started to flake off and this humidifier cannot deliver enough moisture into the air. The other one I bought was a ""green frog"" and works great so far. So I concluded this product has a poor designed ultrasonic head."
1,Anything but quiet,"We just bought this humidifier because it represents that it is, ""virtually silent"". Not so. It bubbles and gurgles like a warm mist humidifier. Very annoying. Further, it was ineffective even in a small bedroom."
1,Does Not Function For Long,"I have bought this item twice, and in neither case did the unit last two winters. The first one started leaking at the base, and the second unit makes vapor, but simply collects at the bottom, and will not come out the top. There is no obstruction, the failure is a complete mystery to me.Other reviews are correct in saying that it is quiet when it does work, and also that the mist goes up and comes down, making the floor wet, even when I have it elevated from the floor by a good four feet.Pass on this one."
2,Not impressed,This humidifier produces a lot of white dust and doesn't really humidify the air well. Not nearly as well as my warm mist humidifier.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this product to increase the humidity in my bedroom. It's ""white noise"" quiet, but after several nights, I couldn't tell any difference in the air quality. I still woke up with very dry nasal passages - even though the humidifier was next to my bed. It was returned to Target."
1,Never Oder Holmes Product - Horrible Customer Support,"This company has horrible customer support. You buy it. You got it. If it doesn't work, you're out of luck!"
1,Awkward to fill,"The Holmes HM-495 UC is nicely styled, but its rounded top withthe integral carrying handle makes it awkward to fill. To fill itthe top section must be removed and held upside down while 25 cupsof water are poured a cup at a time into the fill hole. It is tootall to fit under the tap, and will fall over unless it held becauseof the rounded top. When filled it is also quite heavy to carry backto the lower section. After just one month it just quit working, andwhen I requested service under the one year warranty I was told that another brand of ultrasonic humidifier will be shipped to replace it."
1,"Stay away from Holmes products, cheap junk that never works as advertised.","Every Holmes product I have bought turned out to be poorly designed, never performed as advertised and Holmes customer service is useless. I'm not sure why I kept buying Holmes products, perhaps I was hoping that the previous problems I had were isolated incidents and expected that the next Holmes product I purchased would be ok. It was not, none of them are any good. Never again will I buy anything from Holmes.Strongly not recommended."
1,Do not buy if allergic to mold!!!!,"I wish I never got this item. It was to replace a great humidifier that died after 1 years use.It is loud and hard to fill because of its size only fitting under a bathtubs tap, but the worst thing is it grew mold in the base and got me sick with hardly any use.I was using it for only 2 weeks. I cleaned it like instructed and used fresh tap water to fill it.But noticed I was having much worse allergy problems than before using it.I took it apart and found mold growing in the hard to see areas of the base. I have severe mold allergies! This unit was making me sick instead of keeping me well!!!!I also had a huge problem with scale buildup in the unit as well. We have extremely hard water where I live.I have been unable to find out from company how to remove mold and scale from unit so it will be safe to use again.They also do not know how to stop it from happening in future.I am going to have to trash it and buy a different brand all together."
1,Not satisfied,"We had this humidifier for two weeks when it stopped working for no apparent reason and could not be fixed with any of the trouble shooting ideas that came with the humidifier. To add insult to injury, the 1-800 phone number for customer service is disconnected. I feel that we've been taken for $50 bucks. I don't recommend this product for purchase."
2,Extremely Awkward to Fill,"If you can get it filled and put the cap back on successfully, it works fairly well.But of course to fill it you need 5 hands.There is no flat surface on this thing so you could easily place it in a sink or bathtub leaving you to somehow prop it up/hold it up while trying to fill it. Then you need to somehow get one hand free to turn the water off and locate the cap."
1,"Poor servicability, Poor functionality","Don't waste your time or money with this POS. The tank requires two-three hands to fill, whether you attempt to use a sink, bathtub, or fill with a smaller container. There are no flat sides, therefore you cannot set it down anywhere except the unit's base. Our unit stopped producing mist after about a week of use. A few slaps on the top got it working again. This behavior got worse over time, and I eventually found myself taking it apart to tighten loose screws inside. Eventually that stopped working as well. Now this piece of crap is ready for the curb, or the rifle range. I will say that when it was actually working, I was happy with the output and its quiet operation. We kept it on a low setting, and it was sufficient."
2,Two Month Performance,"I purchased this unit for my elderly mother in a nursing home because her room is very dry, I would turn unit on at approximately 9:00 p.m and return in the a.m. at 7:a.m. and turn it off and refill and clean as needed. I did this for approximately two months or less and then it went dead. It did not fall as it was in a secure area with a ""do not touch sign"" I know no one touched it. Unit worked well when it worked."
2,Poor quality,"Agree with many of the other posters -- it is extremely hard to fill this. You must fill it in the tub and with no handle, the tank can slip out of your hands easily. Once the fiberglass tank breaks, you're done. Also, you must run it with a fan behind it to actually circulate the mist around the room. The fan it comes with isn't powerful enough to do so, so it soaks the area around the humidifier. I've owned many humidifiers in the past and have never had one do this. The filter-free operation is great and it is incredibly quiet. Unfortunately, I don't see those two pluses outweighing its minuses."
1,Seriously?,"I was excited when I first plugged this in...it was SO quiet on the most powerful setting! The following day, I emptied the tank and refilled it. Within about a half hour, mist stopped coming out of the top. When I went to inspect the situation, water was trickling out of the BACK of the unit where the PLUG is. That seems real safe...NOT. Emptied everything out again, filled it back up, plugged it back in (dry of course) and now it doesn't produce any mist what-so-ever...and again, water is trickling out the back. I'm returning this product of course."
1,No customer support,"I bought this unit for use last winter. It performed well for the season, but the o-ring degraded over time. I also noticed the plastic near the spout was also beginning to break down and the two sections making up that area were starting to pull apart. I contacted Holmes to get a new o-ring. They told me 1) they were on backorder, 2) they had LOTS of orders for these, 3) I could not buy just the o-ring, would have to buy the ""cap assembly"" (mind you, the o-ring fits in to the tank, NOT the cap) and 4) they would put my name on a list to be notified when the parts were available. So, now winter is approaching and I call again and am informed that they are no longer making this o-ring (also, keep in mind this is a unique o-ring...nothing you could buy in catalogs or HI stores). I will not buy another Holmes product if I can help it. I am shocked to see they are still selling it despite not having parts for customers who will eventually need them."
1,"It's Short Lived, But It's Expensive","I live in a very small town. We have one variety store from which to buy things like this, and the only humidifiers they carry are Holmes. Over the past couple of years, I've bought several of these--not because I have a lot of rooms to humidify but because their products are so disposable. Either the motors go out or the 0-rings break or they spring leaks in the base. When I have had occasion to contact customer support to try to obtain a new o-ring or lid, I've been told twice that this model has been discontinued (when in fact, year after year, this piece of junk continues to appear on shelves and websites).No more Holmes products for me and I'd recommend that you steer clear as well. This is a lousy product from an apathetic company."
2,works but LOTS of white dust,"I was attracted to this product because it doesn't need a filter. I have other humidifiers - all with filters - and it's getting harder and harder to find the replacement filters.I have had the Holmes HM495 for about a month. I have a great increase in humidity, but it's produced a white dust that is on everything. It's attached itself to every TV, computer, clock, etc. I even had to take my computer in to have the inside screen professionally cleaned.I would return this product if I had kept the box. I would NOT recommend this product."
2,Not noticing much change in humidity,"We run this humidifer 24 hours a day on highest setting in a medium size bedroom where the door is usually closed most of the way. You can definitely see the mist coming out, but the humidity isn't even getting to 40% in the room. It is possible that our device to measure the humidity isn't accurate or something but that doesn't seem to be the case to me. You would think the room would be pretty humid running at high. I would be interested in finding out if the people that liked it actually measured the humidity or just assumed it worked well because it does put out visible mist."
2,"Works well for about a year, then dies","I liked this humidifier well enough -- reasonable price (so I thought) and just a simple, quiet, functional design. Provided you set it right, it does a great job....until it plain stops working.I've bought two of these, and had pretty much the exact same experience as many others here: after less than a year, the mist just suddenly stops. Cleaning (before or after the failure) doesn't help, these just die. I tried to replace the piezo element; I do not recommend this. There are some pretty high voltages in play underneath! (I'm not sure it's the element itself that fails, anyway.)I'm here considering buying a third. Considering that filters for non-ultrasonic humidifiers can be nearly $20 a piece and need changing well more than twice a season, it's not a horrible deal. But I hate filling the landfill with disposable products, and that's what this whole humidifier is."
1,Don't Buy Holmes Humidifier,I have experienced the same problem as all the other '1-star' reviewers. The O-ring dry rotted and their customer service says they don't carry the part. BS!! They just want to sell you another instead of an O-ring that would cost under a dollar. A classic case of planned obsolescence. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!
2,disposable,"I used HM495 last season (Dec.-March) and it did a job. When I set it up again I noticed the valve to release water from the upper part to lower is desintegrated and humidifier is not working. Replacement parts are not avail., so HM495 goes to the garbage. Bottom line: it will work, but not for a long"
1,Very poor quality.... didn't function after using 2 days,I purchased this item and used for 2 days... and suddenly it stopped work... there is no steam coming out of it and I have to return this.
3,Stops Working,"I've gone through two of these. The first one stopped working mysteriously the first week that I had it, and the company replaced it for me. The replacement worked for one season, and then it also stopped working mysteriously. This could be due to hard water, but I soaked it with vinegar regularly. I'm definitely going to try a different brand this time. There are some nice things, there's no light on it, so it's good for a bedroom, and when it does work the noise is really calming."
3,Not sure how well it works.,"We bought this humidifier because our 3 month old baby keeps getting stuffed up during the night with our central air. It is extremely quiet only a little gurgling once in a while. It definitely makes the area around it very wet, I had it sitting on top of a big bath towel and the whole front of the towel was very wet. We've never bought a humidifier before so I don't know how to tell if it's really helping our situation. She is still getting a stuffy nose but the past two mornings it has been easier to help her clear it - so maybe that's the best we can expect? It also says it will last up to 24 hours but that's on the lowest setting and we always have it set on the highest setting and it seems to last about 8-10 hours."
1,If you like to return items this humidifier is for you,"I opened the box, filled it with water, turned it on and.... nothing. Now I get to return it. I wish I would have read these reviews before I bought it. Needless to say I will not be replacing it with another Holmes.P.s.I am very upset that I had to pick 1 star Amazon should make 0 stars an option."
2,So-so,"Tank has large capacity but is unwieldy to fill since it lacks a handle on the base. Also, design of the tank means that it cannot sit upside down -- so after it is filled, the cap must be locked on immediately, before it can be set on the floor. I have owned other (smaller) humidifiers that have never leaked, and this one seems to leak around the base on occasion. Decent for the price, but I thought it would be designed better."
2,Defective,"The unit worked well for our room area emitting sufficient cool mist during the first week only. On second week, the operation suddenly stopped while in use. I called up Holmes and they requested me to dry the unit for 24 hours and re-start. But it never did re-start. It seems that the problem is with the transducer. Holmes replaced it with a Sunbeam SUL-2512 but which does not have the same capacity in emitting mist as the HM495-UC."
3,good humidifier,it works pretty well for smaller rooms. the adjustable dial let's you control the mist volume. the one problem is it's difficult to clean thoroughly.
2,Stopped working after 13 months,"I bought this last winter because it is filterless and low-maintenance. A little over a year later, it simply stopped working. After plugging it in and turning it on, nothing happens, not even the fan turns on. After reading many reviews with the same or similar problems, it seems obvious that this product has longevity issues and should not be purchased. I chose a different brand to replace it.That being said, it did do a good job for the time it worked. It is very quiet and low-maintenance."
1,Didn't last,"This humidifier worked well for a week. It did require some experimentation to get the control in the right place (a little past halfway) to avoid condensation on the table. However, on the eighth day I turned it off when I left for work in the morning and when I returned that night, I turned it on and nothing happened. It had not been touched while I was gone, so I have no idea what happened. After trying a few things with no results, I called customer service. I was asked a few questions and was offered a replacement, but was told it was out of stock and it was unknown when it would be available. A Sunbeam SUL2512 was offered as an alternative and I accepted. The customer service rep was courteous and didn't give me a hard time -- she just asked the sort of questions I expected. The output of this Sunbeam unit isn't as good, but it has worked for more than a week."
1,Humidifer stopped working.,"This was a Christmas gift from my son. The humidifier worked great for about 3 weeks and then stopped putting out moisture. The fan works, but nothing comes out. I took it and cleaned it as instructed, rinsed it out again and still nothing comes out. The fan is working, but that is all."
2,poorly designed,"I own this humidifier, and it does its job fairly decent, but it keeps the area around it quite wet especially in the high setting, so be careful when you put it on top of your wooden furniture because it can rot. It also requires frequent maintenance. The tank does not have a handle when you turn it upside down, which is when you need it the most, when you are filling the tank. It can slip, and the fiberglass can easily break, and that is the end of it."
3,"Works really well, but not durable.","I bought this humidifier the middle of last winter and like that it has a dial that adjusts how much humidity is released into the air and that it holds a great deal of water. My complaint is that though it works well, it developed a leak along one seam within several months after I bought it. So far the water just leaks into the base, so it's still going strong, but I am guessing that the leak will get worse and I'll have to replace it at the end of this season."
2,Broke within one year,"I bought this because I would not need to worry about filter changes. I was pretty happy with it last year, stored it for the summer and took it back out this week. Unfortunately, the fan works but it no longer blows mist. For $45, it should have worked for more than one winter. I will look for another brand this time around."
2,could be great if it didn't leak,"I brought it home, filled it up, dropped the top into the base and walked away. There was a leak around the cap and it spilled a few gallons of water onto my bedroom floor."
1,"A nice looking product with one fatal flaw, impossible to fill easily","There are other brands that are identical to this design.I purchased this humidifier because it is simple and energy efficient. However, it has one fatal product design issue. The water tank is oriented on the vertical as tall tank rather than as a square lower tank.This means that unless you have a deep deep sink (industrial) or fill the tank at the kitchen sink using the pull out hose or facet, you will not fit this tall tank under most bath or kitchen sinks to fill it.To make matters worse, even if you fill it in the kitchen, the opening to fill it is on the bottom (this is normal) but if you invert it to remove the fill cap, the top (which is now the bottom for filling) is not flat. You cannot rest it on the counter.It is just impossible to fill conveniently!I returned mine and went with a model that I could set on the counter to fill at the kitchen. It is not as pretty as this one but much easier to use."
4,"Hey, it's for movie fans","I'm a movie FAN, and I thoroughly enjoyed Knowles' book. Sure, it's spotty, but Knowles would be the first to admit it. There are so many nuggets of wisdom in this tome, that it's worth the time to read it all. Of course, I agree with his opinions. Knowles is a real person without a hidden agenda. Gee, that's refreshing. Those who disagree with him, or who have a hidden agenda will be offended. By the way, those one-star reviews seem suspicous to me. Since Knowles has a lot of enemies in the biz, take those reviews with a large shaker of salt."
1,I wish I could give this 0 stars!,Anyone who gave this book more than 1 star is either writing an intentionally funny review (calling his writing poetic!) or must be a friend/relative of Knowles. This book is horrible and pointless. The fact that it puts his ugly mug on the cover should be the first tip off to stay away; not unlike putting Mr Yuk stickers on Draino.
1,"Boring, infantile, repetitive","Please don't waste your time and money. If you feel like inflicting that kind of self-punishment, just visit his website and read for a bit. The pain comes for free there. The one commendable aspect of this book was the lack of advertisements. I honestly was expecting pop-ups, side bars, banners, or whatever they could come up with on each page of this book, but I couldn't find any. That is definitely a step up from his website."
1,A lesson in self indulgence,"Unless you enjoying reading a book from someone who chooses what movies to review and is biased because of his ""friendship"" with people in the industry, avoid this book. Harry is a self-induldent, holier than-thou geek that lucked out by getting a good domain name and rubbing shoulders with the right people. Hey, it is a free country and he can captitalize how he wishes, but we as consumers should be aware that his opinion is not 100% honest as he says it is."
2,Cool? Nope.,"If you are familiar with Harry Knowles from viewing his website then you've already read most of the stories in this book. If you are a fan then you'll buy the book regardless of reviews. If you aren't then skip it. Mr. Knowles obviously loves movies to an almost alarming degree but there is nothing really orignial in this book. Is Hollywood turning out garbage? Yes. Critics have been saying that since the silent movie era. Are the stuidos more interested in making a quick buck than producing great films? Yeah, of course they are. Not one single observation that Knowles makes hasn't been made before by better writers. The book is a little too slick, a little too cute and way too long. I found it tiresome by the second rant."
1,"A waste of time, effort, and tree pulp","This book is virtually unreadable. It is a fruitless exercise in self-promotion, brought forth by one of Hollywood's greatest sycophants. I would rather reread an airplane instructional pamphlet than open the cover on this abomination again. I would urge people to go and see a movie for themselves, or read an actual piece of creative literature, rather than subject themselves to this book."
1,Amateur hour,"I've been visiting the site since the beginning but as it attracts more attention, the journalistic credibility has, if anything, gone downhill. This book is a jumbled narrative which never goes into any real interesting detail. Maybe Harry just hasn't had anything that interesting happen."
1,Septic Toejam,Just goes to show that just because someone is popular on the internet doesn't mean they can produce quality material in books or video.
1,An example of someone who's too much in love with himself,"...this person is the ultimate fanboy in the universe without an objective bone in his body. It's bad enough that we have to endure at least four paragraphs of Harry's mood on the particular day he sees a movie, or his giddy anticipation with his favorite movie buddy...JUST REVIEW THE MOVIE!..."
2,I love Harry but...,"I love Harry Knowles but... I was dissapointed with this book. When he writes about his life... evocative... powerful... achingly beautiful. The part about his mother being killed for the insurance money moved me to tears. I really can really identify with his struggle. See I used to have some friends and we used to communicate on a website. But then one of them made a joke about me and played me like I was his two bit punk. I was so ashamed of myself. I ran away and could not face them anymore. This book gave me hope! Now I am going to make movies. I can't make excuses anymore. It's time.But when he writes about movies... boring. I can see the movies myself. I want to know more about the man. Especially his romances. It was also way way too short. Dont worry folks, I am sure that his second book will be better."
1,"read it, returned it","One of the more uninteresting books I have read recently. Unless you have some yeaning passion to know more about this man, avoid this book like the plague."
1,Give me a break!,"Ever visted the website of Ain't It Cool? Well if ever there was a misnomer, it was the title of that website because frankly, no it's not. And now we have a book to accompany the grotty world of Knowles. The writing (and I use that word advisidly) is terrible. If ever there was a man who is so in love with himself, so blinded by his own press, so clearly taking bribes and kick-backs, so hell bent on tearing down any movie ever made that doesn't give him a bribe or kick back, it's Harry Knowles. To read his book you'd think he was some kind of folk hero. Newsflash, the man is a joke and so is his nasty, bile inducing website. Pack up and go home. You're an embarrassment to humanity."
1,Worst... Book... Ever!,"If ever there was a real-life Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons, it's Harry Knowles. 'Nuff said!"
3,Is this really country?,"EDITED 1/29/13:I thought it sounded it smidgen like country, but that's it. If this is country beat me with a baseball bat and throw me in the trash!!! It sounds like pure pop to me!!!This is a good song, definitely worth the money it has a great hook. She has a great voice, good, lyrics, and a good melody. The B-side ""Burning in me"" is very good as well. I don't think Lindsay will get very big (time proved I was was definitely right 1/29/13), but that's not to say she isn't talented. What I mean is this: there are a lot of people who make music who are not good singers, ie Britney Spears, Madonna, etc, and yet still make it bigger than the best singers they do not make it because talented people because they are marketed right or marketed enough or are not ""pretty enough"" or have enough charisma or whatever, the reasons are endless.I suggest investing in Lindsay she's a teen worth spending money on!!!God Bless ~Amy"
5,Can't wait for the album!!!,"This girl can sing, she has the voice of an angel, sweet and strong. I can't believe she's so young. A voice that can even make a fan out of an old person like me. (almost 20 yrs. older). Just like Madonna, I know ""Lindsay"" will soon be a household name."
2,For country fans only. Don't think it's pop...,"I thought this was a teen pop singer, but blah! I don't even like it as a country song. ): Sorry, I hate writing bad reviews, but I don't like it! Here's a step-by-step through the songs ):1.Everything U R -**- If ""U R"" a hard-core die-hard country fan I can see you addicted but to me it's just not something that's gonna grow on me...2.Everything U R (Philly Mix)--**&1/2-- It has a cool intro, so it earns half another star, but I don't think one remix can save the song...3.Burning In Me-**&3/4--Ho-hum. Another usual country song.She doesn't have the twang, but it doesn't make it less annoying. Sorry, country and Lindsay just don't appeal to me..."
4,"fits and works, difficult installation","Product was the correct one for this application, but I wound up needing a mechanic to put it in. The sensor was frozen to the exhaust and difficult to remove due to its unfavorable location. Could not get a wrench on it. Not fault of product, fault of Mazda design. Product was exact, went in and works properly. Also, lowest price for an exact fit oxygen sensor that just plugs in. Surprised to find auto parts at Amazon."
5,Prodigious Vocalism,"Birgit Nilsson shows off her prodigious vocalism in this Salome. Just shortly after singing and recording the heavy dramatic role of Amelia in Ballo un Maschera, Birgit Nilsson was able to lighten her voice sufficiently to play Salome effectively in this recording. The world's greatest Brunnhilde and Isolde shows that she is not just capable of being loud but also capable of being ravishingly soft - beautiful pianissimi. Such prodigious vocalism is a rarity. Make sure you take time to listen to this"
5,EXCELLENT,"Having listened to and been at many performances of Porgy and Bess, this really is the best recording.The voices, the caricatures of the characters sparkle. The music comes alive. The conductor, solo artists and chorus shine.As far as CD MANIAC is concerned, I don't think there is an understanding that the performance was to have been as a true, full-blown opera performed to the extent of Carmen or La Boheme. I think this is where the mis-understanding.Gershwin, being that absolute genius he was, shows categorically in this performance that his ""folk"" opera could dazzle as well as any other in the showcase of ""traditional"" operas. So what a composer, what a piece!That is the whole point to this recording.Shame on CD MANIAC."
3,Lackluster Porgy,"This CD was the first to present all 3 hours of music that Gershwin wrote for ""Porgy and Bess"", and it claims that this is how Gershwin intended it to be performed. However, this is not the truth.Gershwin always worked on his music in rehearsals to make it better, and Porgy and Bess was not different. He made many cuts, changes and additions to his score before the final 1935 version his Broadway, whittling down the music to jsut 2 hours and 20 minutes. What resulted was a much tighter story, dramatically.It is definitely interesting to hear all 3 hours (best not taken all at one time). However, Maazel is not likely to be remembered as a great Gershwin conductor.The other main drawback is the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus--they are totally out of place on this recording, singing as if they were singing a Bach Cantata. They do not capture the jazz style, or the singing style that is required."
3,Aluminum grill is toxic,"Although I am enjoying the convenience of this handy stove/grill, one disappointment is that the aluminum grill plate is terrible quality. After using it for a couple of months, I used the grill on a low heat for a slow roast and the grill turned powder blue. This is now toxic metal/chemical powders on my food! I don't understand why Coleman would make a grill plate that doesn't let you use traditional BBQ tools (metal) and second, makes the coating so flimsy it is basically putting toxins on your food."
4,love it.... but should have shopped around,"my only negative comment is that I found the item in a local Sporting Goods chain for 40 dollars less... so I basically paid for shipping even though it was ""free super saver shipping."""
5,Road Trip Grill,"We love our new Coleman grill, it was easy to put together.The documentation was great and easy to follow."
3,Not really sure,3 stars cuz it looks nice but i haven't actually used because i can't find the 16.4 oz propane tanks anywehre
4,Great for camping,"I like the various griddle, grill and stove top pads. I am able to cook just about anything on the BBQ. Used it to reheat and cook just about everything for a Thanksgiving dinner except the turkey(while out camping). The only thing that could be a little better is the height or clearance of the top while closed. I tried to reheat something in a aluminum pan and the top does not close all the way, defiantly not a deal breaker. The clean up is much easier if you pre-spray with Pam."
5,Love this grill!,"I bought this grill for my husband over 5 yrs ago. It's been used ALOT and you would never know it!! We take it tailgating to the races, camping, wherever. Ours came with a full grill. We bought 2 of the 1/2 griddles and a 1/2 grill attachment. This way we can use full grill, full griddle or 1/2 and 1/2. We also bought the travel case for it and an adaptor to hook it to a full size propane tank.We have cooked for crowds up to 10 or 12 on this grill. We cook hambs, hot dogs, chicken, sausages, pancakes, bacon.. anything! We put water in the base of it before cooking. It helps for cleanup and also a good indication of how level it is sitting. This makes clean up of any grease much easier. The secret is to use a non stick spray before cooking anything and clean it while it is still warm. The griddles are so easy to clean, I just wipe them with paper towels. I highly recommend this grill!"
4,A warning...,"I purchased this a month ago. Worked fantastic the 1st night. Then, the next morning...nothing. I have it hooked to my trailer tank with the high pressure hose Amazon recommends. I could not get any pressure from the hose to the grill. I called Coleman and they informed me that the grill/regulator is not made to work off the trailer tanks. The pressure it too great and it is a safety feature they built in. Coleman said ONLY to use the small tanks or a 1-pound ""BlueRhino"" style propane tank. Coleman understood that this was a very common misconception and they shipped me a new regulator without question because they assumed I already blew it out."
2,Twin Cities Mike,"I have been very unhappy with my Road Trip Grill with the primary source of my irritation being the poor engineering of the grill cover. Users are not able to cook food with the grill cover closed. If one cooks with the cover closed, the handle will melt, and the user is also susceptible to serious burns. My question is this: Why have a cover on a grill if you are not able to cook with the cover closed? It makes no sense."
2,Be Careful What you cook,I bought this grill last summer. Used it with good results until I tried to do potatoes on it. I set it on low put some potatoes wrapped in foil on it and left it to cook. I closed the lid and walked away. A bit later I came back to turn the potatoes and the aluminum grate actually melted down around the element inside! I bought this grill because Coleman is a good brand or so I thought. I cant believe they would make these aluminum grates so Cheap! Since then I have invested in the more expensive griddle and grates but @ [...] bucks youd think they would come with the grill and not be Extra! I did email Coleman directly about their shoddy product but they of course never responded
4,We love this BBQ grill!,"We take this grill with us when we use our RV, but it cooks so well, we sometimes wish it could replace our large patio BBQ. The only reason we didn't give this 5 stars is because of the clean-up. You can't just pack it up and put it away after using it; it has to be cleaned. But it's well worth the effort. We just spent 7 days ""dry"" camping (not in an RV park). We used this grill to cook bacon several times--perfect! And the rib steaks we cooked were perfectly cooked also. Hot dogs, chicken...everything. My husband said if he had tried to cook those steaks on our gas BBQ at home he would have had to stand there with a spray bottle to stop the flare ups. This is an awesome grill. We look forward to buying different plates to make it more versatile. It is a great grill."
2,Ended Up Giving It Away,"I was looking for a gas grill/stove combo and settled on the road trip grill. Lots of good reviews, now here's the down side: It is clunky to set up, pretty much takes two people if you want to fold it up without dropping it. The grill has a very wide solid ring around the flame ring which doesn't allow drippings to flow down and smoke, it also clogs up with burned fat. You need to look at one to see what I mean. Sorry, it just didn't suit me."
4,Good Little Grill,Great little grill for the person who cannot have a large grill. The griddle grill feature is really nice. I have taken it ice fishing and have also made steaks at home. Good performer. The stand is much better than that of the Grill 2 Go. Much heavier though.
4,Nice,"Easy to setup, clean & cook. Recommend you buy an additionalColeman R9941A315C Accessory Grill Grate and/or Griddle for twice the cooking space when you need it."
4,doable,wanted something to replace smaller grill to serve more guests but didn't realize what 'open grilling' was. Have used only once but bought all the extras and hope to make more use of it.
3,nice grill,"it is a nice BBQ grill, the quality of the overall grill is okay, i won't say it's good quality because i only bought it a couple months, a couple screws started rusting. Overall, i think the grill is okay, but too pricey with this quality."
5,Perfect Gift,"This was a gift for my son, who wanted it for summer camping trips with his wife and three kids, and football season tailgate parties. He loves it."
4,Good Grill,"Good travel grill. Used as main grill when I lived in apartment. Definitely recommend carrying case (for travel) and hose adapter to hook up to large propane tank. Also, an additional grill side. It only comes with one."
5,Coleman Camp Grill,"Excellent prodcut. Use it at the campground for cooking everything from eggs, pancakes to steaks. Folds up neatly, cleans up nice"
3,disappointed,"I ordered this grill recently and was disappointed in the details about the product description. It specifically states that it comes with cast iron porcelin coated grates. One is a griddle and the other is a grill which I understand. I ordered the extra grill, cast iron, porcelin coated, for more grilling space but I ordered it with the understanding that the grill had cast iron grates. When my grill arrived it had cast aluminum. So now I will have one cast iron and one aluminum grill. If they are going to ship it with cast aluminum it needs to be specified in the product description so people can order matching items."
5,Great Cookin' Little Grill,We bought this grill for camping because it folds compact and seemed tuff. But it also cooks great and cleans up easily.
1,Fluffy lesson plan sequence,"I thought this unit plan was going to be more substantial but it did not meet any subject matter standards. The goals and objectives were shallow and not based on any concrete skills. It seems that the whole lesson plan was focused on getting a student to read the story and understand it but there were no skills emphasized. The goals say things like: to read, to appreciate, to understand. (nothing is measureable or concrete!)The questions were shallow and the activities were not worth the money I paid for. What a waste of money!!If you teach in California don't waste your money. Nothing here meets our Language arts teaching standards."
4,Stretch your imagination,"I thought The House on Mango Street was a an interesting book. It shows character that not many authors use. Sandra Cisneros used a different way to express the feelings in her book. She used a series of short stories called vignettes. The vignettes may be hard at times to remember, but they are a quick read. Cisneros's style of writing is simple, so it is easy to comprehend. Seeing life from a child's point of view is a great way to expand anyone's imagination."
4,The House on Mango Street,"Well I thought the novel was good, and I really enjoyed reading it. I liked the part where she talks about their hair and how she described them like you could smell it. I thought it was good because it's kind of like the real life style people have, or are in. It makes the reader realize what some kids have to go through. Well I have an uncle and his family that are like that. I would recommend the book to others so they could read it and know that is/are peoples lifestyles, and they could realize what they are going through and help them out."
4,Great Product,"I bought this product before I had measured my in-laws dogs paws, and was afraid I had purchased the wrong size. When I recieved the package, the back said that for a German Shephard you should order an extra large, and I had ordered large. They fit just fine. I also ordered a set in medium for their Austrailian Shepherd, also fits just fine. Thanks for a great product, now the dogs can take walks on the hot pavement!"
2,You Get What You Paid For,"These boots aren't bad - it's just one of those products that you get what you paid for type of quality. They came off my dog fairly easily (if he did anything other than slowly walk, they seemed to come off) and a few weeks into using it, the strap you wrap around the ankle/leg to Velcro it to keep the boot on ripped off. I may have been wrapping it too tightly but if I didn't then the boot came off. I just recently bought a pair at PetSmart of a different name, cost me $40 but they are solid, hardcore and great. For this, spend the extra money and get a more ""solid"" product."
4,True to size,"Nice little bootie..I only use when below zero outside. Wish they made them a little higher on the leg though, I think the pup would be more comfortable and accepting then."
3,What is this movie about?,This movie is too superficial. I could not understand what the movie is trying to show or tell. What is the point?
4,Excellent introduction to Cajun music.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this video.The music featured was very diverse and was not over-produced, as are so many documentaries of folk music.Of particular interest to me was the historical background of the music and the diversity in the Black and White Cajun communities.I just wish the didn't have to show so much of Alan Lomax's mug! :-)"
4,Some valuable points undermined by partisan and sloppy analysis,"Cass Sunstein'sThe Partial Constitutionpresents an interesting case for holding judicial impartiality as the overarching norm for judicial review. He first shows that judges should shouldn't necessarily refer to the status quo as the appropriate baseline because it is the reflection of prior governmental and societal that might not have been appropriate. His impartiality framework tries to input more substance into the norms of review than the neutrality standard commonly floating around academia in the 1950s and 60s. Overall, a useful contribution to constitutional theory."
2,Dissaponted,"I got this book to learn how to generate fractals and use the included programm to generate large images for printing. While the programm is very flexible in terms of what it generates, maximum resolution is something like 600x400. There are better books that bescribe what fractals are. This book will not help you to set up calculations on you own and it's fractal generation programm is useless for anything other that on screen display."
1,Cover advertised to go with MP4 I purhcased.,This items was advertised to go with the MP4 I had puchased and it was entirely too big for the item.
5,BUY THIS DAMN ALBUM,"ITS GREAT 2 HEAR YELLA ON THE SOLO TIP. ONE THING U WILL REALISE FROM HEARING HIS ONLY SOLO ALBUM IS THAT HE IS ONE OF THE MOST TALENTED NWA MEMBERS AND ACTUALLY PRODUCES MUCH FRESHER SOUNDS THAN DR DRE DOES THESE DAYS.IF YOU WERE A BIG EAZY E FAN U WILL RECOGNISE ALL THE RAPPERS ADDING THE VOCALS TO YELLAS LAIDBACK GROOVES:KOKANE, BG KNOCC OUT, DRESTA, DIRTY RED, ETCIT ALL JUST SOUNDS SO GOOD AND IS THE PERFECT ALBUM 2 LISTEN 2 DURING THE LONG HOT SUMMER.U JUST HAVE 2 BUY THIS ALBUM WITHOUT ASKING QUESTIONS BECAUSE U WILL NOT HEAR A MORE ADVENTOROUS ALBUM COMING OUT OF THE LA GANGSTA GENRE-THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY BEST RECORDS FROM THE ENTIRE NWA CATALOGUE-CERTAILY IN THE TOP 3 OR 4."
4,Some Real Good Beats and Rhymes: 4.25 Stars,"DJ Yella from NWA finally comes out with his own album ""One Mo N---- Ta Go"" in 1996. The only real problem with this album is that it has way too many interludes and not enough songs. Other than that, the album is a great tribute to his dear friend Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright 1963-1995 RIP. The album is often heartbreaking, and at times really sad, because he speaks so highly of his friend that he lost to AIDS. Yella puts so much passion into honoring his late friend in songs like ""4 Tha E"" featuring Kokane. His beats are smooth, laid back G-Funk which are refreshing breaks from the seeming endless selections of hard core beats that prevailed in 1996. One song, ""Send 4 Me, with the lovely voice of Traci Nelson, is not even a rap song at all, but an excellent R&B track. He also has a good rapping voice. It's too bad he didn't come out with more albums!"
1,thanx for the dedication but the music...,I admire the way that dj yella nobely took the stance and stood up for tha E. But this album was a disapointment. Yella isn't a very good rapper and the beats were just too basic. I wish that he could have got somebody else to write the songs and all because the quality of this album just disapoints me.
2,Neglectable,Gal Costa seems to have lost her direction in music due both to her repertoire choice and to her way of vocalizing. Such low keys for a singer who does not have low power is a crime. Inexpressive arrangements.
1,Twice embarassed,"The rating is not for the quality of the book, but for the signature. When I read that it was ""Signed"" I assumed that meant by Glenn Miller, since the book was quite old. Nowhere did I see that it was signed by the author, although that was probably wishful thinking on my part and it does make sense that the author would sign it... but to make matters worse, it was signed to some other man and I was giving it as a gift. We live in a foreign country so the book was hand carried more than 11,000 miles to give as a gift to our neighbor who is a fan of Glenn Miller. I was embarassed to explain why it was in another recipient's name, but that I hoped he enjoyed the book. I think it should have been much clearer in the description. And to me, when something is signed, it's not personalized to someone else it's simply signed."
2,"Book in OK condition. I expected to be a little less ""handled""","The title says about all I have to say. Not a bad deal just expected the book to be a little ""tighter"" I using it as a reference tool now as I have already read it from a ""crisp"" copy from the library. So it's OK."
2,eh...,"This pad arrived, and I was very disappointed in the product. It DID NOT look like the photo at all... It looks a lot nicer in the photo but looked ""cheap"" when I got it. It appears to be bluer in the picture but in actuality it's a dark GREEN with brown and darkish yellow - with white stitching - think diagonal almost ""quilt-like"", and the edges are all finished off with serger stitching, much like what inseams of machine made clothing looks like on the inside. All the threads were just hanging off, not trimmed or finished off nicely at all.Backing is a medium greenish fabric, whether it is leakproof I can't say, it does have a nylonish/slippery feel to the underside but it doesn't stay put when I tried it on my chair.It is NOT worth the $14 bucks, the other pad I ordered which was $11 had a velour cover, soft, finished edging and much MUCH nicer looking and is better value for the $ IMHO. I'll keep this one to be my spare if I need to wash the first one, not worth spending $ to return."
3,Wheelchair under pads,Does the job. Wish I knew why most wheelchairs are black but you can not find these items in black to blend in?
5,Great Buy,This was the best chair pad I've purchased. Have already washed several times and it still looks new. Pad is absorbant and easily fits into chair.
3,size discrepancy,"The description says they are 18 X 24, but they are actually 17 X 22 3/4. Shouldn't matter that much, but for the use I intended, it did matter. Fabric looks nice"
4,Traditional Country Folk at it's Best,"Porch Songs is a beautifully understated piece of work. The CD consists of all acoustic arrangements on traditional and original material. Cathryn's sweet voice along with the strumming of acoustic guitars, dobro, and mandolin creates a wonderfully intimate listening experience. It's a shame this gem of a recording has been heard by so few. If traditional heartfelt country/folk music along the lines of Iris Dement or Alison Krauss is your passion, please don't overlook this disc."
5,spectacular performance,"This CD is remastered version of a 1962 Covent Garden production, with Sutherland and Pavarotti at an early moment. Their voices have a lightness and ease that were not (and could not physiologically be) sustained in the later (superb) progression of their careers. Sutherland is splendid here. But Pavarotti's aria, A Mes Amis, is spectacular. It's at band 12 and 13 on disc one, and I've listened to it alone maybe twenty times since I purchased the set two months ago. Whenever an opera-loving friend comes to visit, I insist that we listen to this aria -- and my friends and I are thrilled and disbelieving at what we hear from him. The aria is, of course, famous for its difficulty in the tenor's repertoire, requiring nine High C's in close succession at its conclusion. But Pavarotti makes it seem almost casually accomplished. Just to have this performance is enough to justify the purchase."
5,"Count them, NINE high C's","Yes, that's it nine high C's in one aria. And Pavorotti did it with ease. And that soprano from down under does one better by hitting high D's and high E's. This is a real roller coaster ride of an opera with nice tunes and tour de force singing from Sutherland and Pavorotti."
5,Fabulous,"This is one of the rare jems of opera-one of those definitive recordings. The two principal artists (Sutherland and Pavarotti) are at the height of their vocal powers. Sutherlands coloratura and trills are incomperable, and Pavarotti hits EVERY ONE OF THE 9 HIGH Cs in ""Pour mon ame"" right on the nose. This is a must have recording."
2,Most were whitish-colored and mushy,"The few which seemed to be cooked correctly were delicious, but most of the fingers were a light color and mushy."
4,"Yummy, honey , crunchy phillo dough and cashews....","These are just as described, ""SWEET AND CRUNCHY PHILLO DOUGH PASTRIES""...love these just as much as the baklawa with walnuts...yummm!!"
2,A sad recording,"Joan Sutherland was about 60 at the time of this recording. What you hear is a barely recognizable Sutherland sound. The Decca cd set with Sutherland/Horne is the one to get, believe me. Sutherland and Horne were dropped dead gorgeous in their 1960's definitive Norma. If you choose to buy this set because Caballe is Adagisa, be warned that the two divas sound very boring and tired. All of Sutheland's famous high notes are completely gone, even her trill and colortura runs are inaccurate. Please, I'm Sutherland's biggest fan, that's why I'm telling you how it really is. This Norma is a disaster. Remember though, the Sutherland's earlier Norma with Marilyn Horne is a real gem."
1,How did this get released?,"Sutherland's performance in the first act was shockingly inept. It was painful to listen to her struggle vainly to reach the notes, to pronounce the text. Her desperate, ineffectual efforts to sing the role brought tears to my eyes. Could not her husband have set down his baton, given back their fees, and refused to go on? Could noone have squelched this release, out of respect for her? Caballé and Pavarotti are in good voice and Caballé makes the wimpy Adelgesa a suddenly compelling role. However, Sutherland deserves not to have been disrespected in this way. It made me furious for her. The masters should have been burned."
3,Bellini's Norma,"Pavaroti is in great voice, Caballe is brilliant, Sutherland is OK, but obviously past her prime. It doesn't have the excitement of other ""Norma's"", but is a good addition to a ""Norma"" collection."
5,MOST BEAUTIFUL SOUNDING NORMA RECORDING AVAILABLE,"If you want the most dramatic interpretation of this opera, look to the Callas recordings due to the wonderous performance by Callas. The boring conducting by Serafin and quality of singing and interpretation by the supporting casts in both of the major studio recordings done with Callas will not impress you. If you want to be enthralled with beautiful sound, look to this opera recording with Sutherland and no further. Sutherland, Pavarotti, and Caballe are the dream cast for this opera, backed by brilliant conducting by Bonynge. The quality of the recording itself is incredible, and you will not be disappointed. If I had to pick just one Norma recording from my collection, this would be it."
4,"20 years after her 1st recorded Norma, Joan still great","Sutherland's first recording of Norma remains one of the definitive recordings of bel-canto. She was just unsurpassed by any other singers of this century, or maybe even EVERY century, I guess we'll never know. But this recording was made 20 years after the diva's first recording, and what she had lost in voice she made up with pure passion! Sutherland's technique still incredible, though the high notes are not as good as those in her prime, and the vibrato a little wide. Even past her prime, La Stupenda is still far superior to all other Normas, including Callas. Pavorotti and Caballe were excellent, but their stars are eclipsed by Sutherland's, of course."
2,This is much less than should be expected.,"Unfortunately, this recording was made from behind the conductor in orchestra, rather than on stage. As a result the individual performances, and their power and subtlies get lost. This is very unfortunate. The entire recording shouldbe re-engineered."
2,"Lovely, but not Sutherland's best","Sorry, Sutherland is way off here. I'm sure I'll get a lot of insults for telling it as it is, but she is just awful here. For a great Prima Donna to admit that she's lost it, I know it's hard, but she has definitely lost it here. Check out her 1964 recording of Norma with the great Marilyn Horne, and you'll be greatly satisfied...buy this and you're heart will sinked. Sorry, I mean 2 stars only!"
2,Can't recomend..,"Most of Mark's work is just wonderful but this efforet's underpar. Read, 'What On Earth Is Going On' It's Mark's best outline to date and covers the same ground here."
5,Great Book,"This is a great book by many that participated in the ""Return of the Peregrine""! Dedicated wonderful folks"
2,Inaccurate and poorly researched,"I decided to read this book after seeing the author interviewed on C-SPAN's ""Booknotes"" show. I was amazed that he was able to pack so much mis-information into a sixty minute chat. Stevens repeatedly demonstrated that his grasp on political and military affairs of 1863 was virtually nil. He was especially uninformed about Ulysses S. Grant, who was (to put it mildly) a pivotal player in the year 1863. Curious, I bit the bullet and bought the book. A mistake of the highest order!After reading the book, I am more convinced than ever that Stevens had no business writing this book. His interpretations of Lincoln, Grant and Hooker are amateurish and riddled with mistakes of the most elementary nature. His bibliography is of the most elementary sort and no primary sources were consulted or included within the narrative. In short, this is a completely inadequate look at one of the most important years in the history of the American nation."
1,A Review of Kirkus Reviews,"First of all, the Army of Northern Virginia did not ""crawl"" back to Virginia. They conducted a fighting retreat and gave Meade a bloody nose at Falling Waters while waiting for the Potomac's waters to drop enough to ford. Second, Meade did not push Lee back to the ""suburbs of Richmond."" Lee occupied the line of the Rapidan River and prepared for future operations. If ""1863"" makes these assertions, then it is a seriously flawed work."
4,A book for all civil war history buffs. !!,Stevens writes from the all sides of the story. Everyone should read this book it tells more of the story of the civil war. History teachers should make this required reading. Couldn't put it down. Makes learning more interesting.
4,Fobus double mag holder,"Will pay attention to details. Did not realize it was going to ship from Israel - way too long, I gave myself three weeks and it took five."
3,"Does its job, but do not expect concealment!","I purchased this double magazine holder for CCW purposes. For that purpose, it is an abject failure. Simply put, it is too large and bulky. It is very high quality; of that you cannot quarrel. However, as can be seen in the photo, the construction is bulky by design. There are rivets on the outside. It makes it very hard to carry under a shirt nearly anywhere except right in your front waist area. That, however, makes it impossible to crouch or bend down, and makes it entirely obvious that you are carrying something -- which defeats the purpose of CCW. Unless you are walking into a gunfight, for which no concealment is necessary or warranted, I suggest a different product."
2,Caution with the GLOCK 27,"As has been identified by others, the holster is simply too tight for a GLOCK 27. It took me way too many attempts to get the pistol out of the holster. But, it really looks good and I have been working to loosen it so it will fit properly. I have several Fobus holsters: One for my GLOCK 26 and one for my GLOCK 21. They are appropriately snug which gives a lot of safety; however, I never had to struggle to get my weapon out of the holster like I have this one....a little disappointed and could be a little dangerous."
3,"Very sturdy, but not very comfortable","This mag holder is very sturdy, but I find that it is not very comfortable. It tends to dig into my side. Fortunately I live in an open carry state, so I can tuck my shirt in behind it when it gets too uncomfortable."
3,Strong and sturdy,"This is a strong, sturdy mag pouch that should last a long time. It's easy to clip onto a belt. Unfortunately, one of my mags doesn't fit for some reason. Maybe I got an irregular?The price was great and I'll probably buy some more."
4,Good but...,"I bought these to hold my G19 9 mm mags, and while they do a great job at holding them in, they were a little dinged up, almost used looking. I have not tried jumping with the mags in, although I'm pretty sure they would be fine, they are a snug fit and do the job well."
2,Not fun at all,This game was really dissapointing. The graphics aren't that great and a lot of the game is really complicated. My husband loves car and racing games and he only played this game a couple of times before he put it in the forgettable pile. I've seen better Muther Trucker games.
5,A most timely satire,"Never mind that this work has some of the most beautiful music ever composed for any musical format, it is Gilbert's lifelong battle against human stupidity (is there any other kind?)that makes this libretto so incredibly timely. The second act opens with a sentry commenting on how party loyalties make it unnecessary for politicians to have any brains at all when it comes to voting; and this is followed soon after by a song about how those who govern do best when they do not meddle ""in matters which they do not understand."" Good advice for bureaucrats who know how to run hospitals, schools, and private behavior. For once, you might not want to program out the dialogue...which is not given separate tracking so you could not do it anyway. A real treat for those who never heard IOLANTHE and the only recording with the complete dialogue."
5,Next Level,"New instructors in this video. Not why they switched from Tiffiny to Angel, but the instruction is still top notch. This vid was shot in a new location, and the aerials are even bigger and more impressive.I wanted to take my swing dance to the next level after watching movies like Swing Kids, but didn't know where to start. This gave me a leap start into the world of aerial dance moves. Though definitely not for beginners, Daniel and Angel break each move down, address safety concerns and make the execution easy. This series teaches to many moves, and the instruction is so in depth, I can't believe it doesn't cost more than it does. I go back from time to time to brush up on moves, or how to make them cleaner and present better. Highly suggest all the videos in this series."
5,i love this movie!,"when i first saw what was coming on after ""the seven year itch""i thought i'm not going to like this movie...I WAS WRONG! it's one of the best movies i've ever saw!"
4,Great for the Toy Story fan in your home!,"""Hey Slink grab the wheel. Ham & Rex control the peddles, Mr. Potato Head navigate."" ~ Toy Story 2My 3 year old son can quote this movie verbatim. However, this is his favorite line in the movie. Our house LOVES the ""Toy Story"" movies. Therefore we had to have Slinky Dog the bank. My son is learning to recognize the different coins as he puts them into his bank. So I guess it does have some educational value. You have 2 methods to put the coin in Slinky. You can place the coin on his tongue and pull his collar to have him lick it up or you can use the traditional slot like most piggy banks have. While the tongue thing is cute, it does not always work correctly. Overall I would recommend purchasing this item if you are a fan of the ""Toy Story"" movies."
4,Marvelous... with one huge exception,"Every piece has its magic moment, it's ""money shot."" For Turandot it's Nessum Dorma. For The Messiah, it's the Hallelujah Chorus. For Cavelleria Rusticana it's the Easter Prayer scene, the entrance of the corpus de Jesus. Preghiera, or Easter Hymn. That piece is missing from this otherwise delicious rendition. This CD SHOULD have been noted as excerpted -- featuring most solos/duets... only. Caveat emptor. It's a reasonable price to pay to hear Pavarotti. But when the melody is referenced in other pieces, you realize what you're out. There is a decent version of it on the Godfather III soundtrack, believe it or not."
2,Missing fires,"2 1/2The second half offers at least some redemption from an awfully conceived first side of terribly written and produced rock ""fusion""."
2,Nice but canopy doesn't last,"We purchased ours in 2007 and really like the construction and durability of the frame, however we are on our third canopy. It doesn't take alot of wind or one nice sized storm to rip the canopy and the metal hooks. I tried patching the first one and got another month out of it. This last replacement one only lasted 1 week. Nice gazebo but plan on investing in additional canopies for $150 each, and they are only sold by the original manufacturer for the 2007 version (and currently out of stock)."
4,Summer oasis,"Assembly is NOT for the individual. . .getting the top on requires four bodies. It is very beautiful and larger than an average gazebo. However, I am surprised that it is not exactly waterproof. Rain does make its way from the top in several places. Having said that, we are happy with our purchase."
3,"Good, but top didn't last as long as I'd hoped...","I purchased this gazebo a little over 1 1/2 years ago. The frame is built quite well. I bolted the legs to my deck and it has endured the weather nicely. Unfortunately, a few weeks ago, I noticed the top starting to rip where the clips are sewn to the top. When I investigated it further, the top started tearing like paper because it is dry-rotted. This past weekend, I looked on the deck to see the top completely torn and hanging from the center! I will be calling the recommended number in the other review to order a new top tomorrow. This time I will use industrial Scotch Guard w/ UV protection on it before installing!On a positive note: I was able to mount an outdoor ceiling fan to the center using an ABS outdoor junction box. Even on high, it holds the fan rock solid!"
5,Sunjoy Rocks!,"We've had our gazebo since spring 2006 and it has held up wonderfully these two years! Of course, I tried searching online to find out where I could find a replacement canopy, but I was not happy with the prices I had to pay. Thanks to the review posted below, I found out I had to call Sunjoy in order to receive a replacement canopy (mother nature destroyed it in a horrific wind storm this week). I paid $81 TOTAL! Including shipping! That's compared to the $139 - $200 I was finding online. It will be here in 7-10 days! I am thrilled! Thanks!"
3,Customer Service? Not from Target.,"Purchased this gazebo two years ago, and in the interim, misplaced the assembly manual. Product is still available from Target, so it shouldn't be that difficult to get in touch with the manufacturer, right? 1st try with Target sent me to a company called Agio. Second try, Target sent me to SunJoy, no matter that I provided the DPCI#. Thankfully Marshall, a very pleasant and professional CSR at SunJoy was able to provide me with the number to New Mark Industries: 800-457-4652, and the assembly manual and hardware are already on their way."
3,Just Plain Stupid Fun,"Yeah, we all know Peter Hymas is seriously working for that ""Worst Director in 30 Years Award"" (Closely followed by Schumacher) but David Arnold's ""Musketeer"" score is a tip back to old 1950 serials and swashbucking pirates. It's a bit louder and more musically complex than, say, Korngold but there is a definite sound of them in it. His title theme is yet ANOTHER rip off of William's ""Superman"" theme (arguably, Bill Conti did the same, but improved it, for ""Masters of the Universe"") but as a whole, the score is just loud, loud and louder action cues."
5,"""Sound of Music"" pure genius",This recording of the Sound of Music is the best that I have ever heard. I was fortunate enough to play the role of Friedrich von Trapp in the Australian production and am featured on this live recording. However I still honestly believe that this is the best Australian version you will ever get.
1,Beirut Jazz Beat,"Well, Jazz and Far Eastern music are two different cultures. This mixture Bob James is trying to make is not at all compatible. It is not like with spanish or Brazilian.Adding to this the music is light, like for beginners, even though i am a big fun of bob James music and I have all his albums. But Sorry Bob, it doesn't fit.Imad Tawil - Beirut Jazz Beat"
4,over the years,Bob James continues to reinvent himself and still give a sound that is in his style with out being predictable
3,ups and downs,"Ive owned this cd for a bout 4 months now and have given it plenty of listens in that time and i still have difficulty forming an all encompassing opinion of it. It definately has its highs and lows, most of the high points are scattered on the first few tracks (hyperborea, murder, new york city) But then there are some tracks that are just a waste of cd space, consisting of nothing but unentertaining noise. Overall i like the direction Horse is moving but i think they could have put more effort into making this album more coherent and, well...fun. So for the seasoned Horse fan, yes this album is worth buying because it has a few songs that are pure gold, but if your just started listening to them i would recommend the mechanical hand instead."
3,Instumetal?,"Hyperborea, Murder, New York City, Face of Bear, and (I'll even include) Sex Raptor are the only real songs with all members included. The rest are instrumental, spoken word, girls crying, or really short in general. It could easily have been an EP if they cut the fat. It would have been better than Pizza hands down. It's almost similar to TMV's Frances The Mute in that way, just not as good. It's sad day for the fans of R. Borlax and The Mechanical Hand, but only if you buy the cd. You should find another means (getting it from a disappointed buyer.)"
5,FERICIOUS!,"OK, so I don't actually own this disc, yet. I saw Gary, twice, in his hard rock heyday, my favorite Gary. Gary isn't a great singer? Neither was Hendrix. Gary is fatter?Yeah, and? When people think of Hendrix they think guitar. When I think of Gary I think guitar, period. In his hard rock heyday there wasn't a guitarist alive I would havetaken over Gary. Not Blackmore, not Schenker, not Eddie Van Halen, etc. It's not a question of being better than those guys, I loved how Gary played. I loved his passion,his attitude on guitar, his ferociousness. He played like the ship was going down. And he had some serious guitar chops. Listen to his work with Colosseum II.I love Gary's blues stuff but his hard rock playing does it for me. I'm sure this disc kicks butt. It's Gary Moore!"
2,only 2.0 mix1?,Just listened to this and it's only a 2.0 mix on the bluray version on both DTS-HD and Dolby 5.1 tracks.Checked my system and all other disks sound fine.Anyone else?
3,Charity,This book leaves too much in the air. There needs to be a clear ending to the love triangle and Fiona doesn't deserve the possibility of a happy ending.
3,Good at the start but lagged at the finish line.,"As an avid fan of all the Bernard Samson books I eagerly awaited this ""final"" book of the series. Like all of Deighton's readers I was anxious to find out the true meaning of the many riddles found in the nine book saga and to learn what would happen to the intricately developed characters who had become almost like personal friends. Charity was up to par until the last several pages. But what happened then? Seems like Deighton got called out of town and asked his gardener to wrap up the book! The ending contains lots of inconsistencies with the previous books and leaves huge holes unfilled. Perhaps this is all a ploy by Deighton to ensure one or more books will be added to the series. I sure hope so, for if Charity is the end of the line for Bernard Samson, he went out like a lamb"
2,"Weak End To A Wonderful Series: A Wimper, Not A Bang","The last dance for Bernard, Fiona, Gloria et al, and a slow dance it is. The resolution to this 10 book series is not of the same caliber, pace, or quality as the preceeding ones.Still, Deighten at his worst is better than many lesser writers at their peak; it's probably worth reading this just to find out how it all turns out."
4,The Wall has not fallen yet,"Len Deighton's Spy series feels a little like watching Episode 1 of Star Wars - absolutely compelling but not finished. In fact as Lucas has shown, you can pick up a story 4/9ths of the way through, film part 5 and 6, wait 15 years and then film part 1. All Deighton fans know that Bernard has not fulfilled his role in spy literature because the communist evil empire still exists. I hope Mr. Deighton is still fit and well because the resolution in this book is not going to satisfy the millions who have galloped through the other 9 (including Winter). I loved this book, and I can't wait for more. If Dicky Cruyer doesn't cop another beating and Bernard doesn't get to play dad again in the fourth trilogy, I guess I'll be hanging out for the fifth."
4,Mostly good,"Installation was a breeze. Only takes about 15 minutes to put up, if that. The mechanisms are very smooth. I really like the versatility of hanging different size bikes with this product. One downfall...if you don't go directly into wood, then the screws aren't long enough to go through 5/8"" sheetrock and then into the stud. I would recommend getting longer screws or your bike might fall when lowering/raising as mine did. Not sure what everybody else is talking about with the ropes. Mine (I ordered 3 of these kits) were all in perfect shape and are not ""cheap""...a substantive rope for the use."
3,"I like it, but it could be better",Easy to install and easy to hoist up. The only problem I have with it is that once the bike is down you have to be careful to not have the gravity pull the pullies all the way to the floor and the rope get pulled right up to the ceiling.
4,Racor PH-1R Bike Lift,Very happy with product. Installed easily and works great. Installed in the garage and keeps the bike out of the way.
5,Superb Bicycle Storage Idea,"I have previously purchased two of these items at a bicycle shop out of town. They are excellent....I now have four. To use over your car in a garage the ceiling must be at least 11-12 feet high for an adult to walk under the hanging bicycle. Movement up and down is safe, smooth and secure. Rope locking system is safe and easy to initiate. To be doubly sure, rope can then be looped over the wall bracket too. Amazon price on these was less than half that which I paid in the bicycle shop.....and the shop had run out and couldn't remember the brand or supplier. Amazon to the rescue! Have someone hold the ladder and be sure to orient correctly and screw into the ceiling joist when installing, of course."
5,Great way to keep bikes out of the way!,I was skeptical about these types of mounts but at my new house I have very high ceilings and wanted to get them out of the way. These worked great!
4,Racor PBH-1R Ceiling mounted bike lift,"Hoist works okay,Racor PBH-1R Ceiling-Mounted Bike Liftexcept that the instructions for threading the rope through the pulley tension mechanism were very poor. As a result, I guess I threaded it through incorrectly, causing the nylon line to chafe, and finally broke after using the hoist less than a dozen times. Guess I need to buy a new line, and contact the manufacturer for more specific instruction."
3,"Great concept, poor implementation","This is a very useful, nifty little device. Too bad the manufacturer won't committo making it a quality product. It does sell for a cheap enough price that you can afford to swap in a high quality rope and some decent screws. To fit the brackets snuggly over a 2x joist, you'd need to shim it on either side. It also should be shimmed on the underside, because the nuts holding the pulleys prevent the brackets from fitting flush to the joist bottom. Without the bottom shims, stress is not distributed evenly. The whole design, in addition to the crappy screws, invites unsafe installations unless you make some corrections."
3,Be prepared to replace the rope.,"This product works and is relatively easy to install. However, the supplied rope is garbage. It has many frays right out of the box, and, upon first use, looks like it could break at any time. It is some cheapo cotton worthlessness. Would you feel comfortable with that cheap stuff suspending a bike over your new Lexus? It's too bad these folks don't have the foresight to spend a few extra few cents and supply a real rope instead of making customers go out to buy one and then having to reinstall it. Shame on them."
2,Could be better,"The product could be better but if you buy better rope and install it well it works. The rope it comes with is not intended to be used with pullys, it falls apart. BUT for the price, after the rope is replaced, it is OK. NOTE the warrenty excludes damage from product failure for any reason, even defective product!"
3,Installation can take a while,"""Installation takes only a matter of minutes""Not accurate. It can take quite a while. In my case, I had to go against the grain so to speak with the support beams in my garage. Therefore had to go to hardware store, buy a mounting board, and attach it to the ceiling in my garage, then attach this to the piece of wood that was installed. All said, about 3 hours.Like the other reviewer said, replace the screws that come with it. I bought stainless steel bolts to go with the mounting board.."
3,Great Lift for the Price,"My only complaint with this mount is the cord starts to fray over time. A replacement nylon cord can be purchased at any sports store. For the price, it can't be beat! Depending on your seat design, the hooks slip a bit over time while it's hanging from the ceiling and it looks like their going to slide off, but they manage to stay in place."
4,Easy Peasy Install,"I was concerned after reading all the comments about the quality of the rope included, so I was already prepared to make a trip to the hardware store upon arrival of the lifts...but found the included rope was just fine. After hoisting them up (I bought 2..and I have a VERY tall garage ceiling, so I needed to keep the entire length of the ropes) I found it was a pain to wrap ALL that rope onto the single cleats. To counter this issue, I plan to purchase an additional cleat for each lift and mount them ~2' lower than the included cleats so I can wrap between the 2 cleats...thus 'using up' ~ 2' of rope on each wrap...making it much more likely I will actually take my bikes down to ride them!"
4,"GOOD PRODUCT, WELL MADE AND DESIGNED","Product is just as described in literature. Only problem is that bike must hung over a clear floor area, not over a table or work bench, bike must be lowered vertically only, not over to the side or else the locking mechanism doesn't work as designed."
4,Great Solution on the Cheap,"This is a great solution to today's small garage woes. We have just enought room in our garage for two vehicles and very little else. I purchased 4 of these lifts to hoist our 2 bikes as well as 2 ladders.Installation was a snap and the hoist workes exceptionally for bicycles. I did not have any of the frayed rope problems I have seen in other posts. This system is not ideal for ladders, however. Although the hoist works fine, it is not quite as easy to use for ladders. You have to kind of help the ladders along as you are pulling them up. Other than this, the product worked great - and it's pretty hard to beat the $20 price tag!"
4,tough installation,this product definitly freed up space in our garage. Luckily I read previous reviews and went out and bought better screws which was an additonal $20 for good ones. We also mounted these on 2x4's which I think helped alot as our garage ceiling it so high and my husband is not to good with heights. I think it is also a plus to get an extra set of hands to help. The rope did fray as previous reviewers stated but all in all the bikes are up and staying. If you have a really nice car you may worry about these being suspended over head but knock on wood so far so good.
5,Racor Ceiling Mounted Bike Lift #PBH-1R,This is a great product. Easy to install and holds the weight of a large mens bike. We have 4 of them in our garage to keep ours and our children's bikes up and away from the ground so that we can put our cars in there during the winter months and it works out great! Highly recommend!
4,great product if you have minimal space for storage,"Great product, my husband installed 2 of them within 1 hour. (although he is very handy) Only improvement would have been a stronger gauge rope. Other than that, very happy!"
5,Spacesaving Bike Storage,"I bought two of the Racor Ceiling mounted bike lifts to get our bikes off the garage floor where space is it a premium. The instructions were clear but I found the supplied wood screws to be a little short when you have 5/8"" drywall on the ceiling that must be penetrated before reaching the ceiling joists. For safety I bought longer wood screws to make sure I had a deeper penetration into the wood ceiling joists above my garage. The most difficult part of the installation is locating the studs and making sure you are screwing into the center of the stud for maximum support of the bike lift. The pulley system for raising and lowering the bike works very well. It took me about one hour to install each Racor lift."
4,"Awesome for price, careful when installing","I have higher ceilings (15-20 feet or so) so I decided to purchase these instead of the plain hooks. They are great for the price and the rope is enough with plenty of slack. I would rate it 4.5 stars. It would be nice if they included some dry wall anchors.Make sure you drill into a stud, or buy dry wall anchors.... don't ask me how i know.."
4,So Far SO Good,"If you have a high enough ceiling in your garage this is the product to buy. I read some of the reviews, not just the 5's. I read the 3's and the 1's. I have 2 bikes that are now safely stored up on the garage ceiling. I also purchased 2 more and hoisted my dingy up to the ceiling as well. The dingy weighs about 90 pounds and I have one on the bow and one on the stern. I do have a problem with it not hoisting evenly. But, it's still up there !! I will take some peoples recommendation about the rope and replace it if I see it fraying. GREAT buy fo the $$$....."
5,Works better than expected,Able to hang and retrieve bikes in seconds. Leverage and locking systems are well thought out. This is a quality product.
4,Works well,"Installation went well.Purchased two, total install took 35 mins. Do not trim rope till you are finished and can bring bike back to the floor with a little bit of slack. Made that mistake only once."
4,works well for storing bikes,"I used two of these to store a bike and ladder on my garage ceiling. They work as advertised and are solidly built. The only problem is that the screw holes on the sides are too close to the pulley which doesn't leave enough space to screw in the screws with a cordless drill; I had to use a regular screwdriver.Also, I recommend tying a stopper knot in the rope a few feet from the end. That way if the end of the rope gets pulled up all the way it won't go through the latch and fall out the other side."
3,Racor Ceiling Mounted Bike Lift,"This is the third bike pulley system I've purchased. I absolutely love them for their convenience of bike storage in the garage. This rating would have been easily been 5 stars, excepting for the poor quality of the line which ships with the product. As I mentioned, I bought three, the third came with a frayed, worn and twisted piece of line that should have been rejected at the factory. Te frayed portions would not fit through the pulleys (and really shouldn't be used regardless), so I will have to either send the unit back or buy my own pulley line. As I've already mounted the unit before I discovered the poor condition of the line, you can guess which I'll do.Bottom line, I would recommend this product, but check the line carefully before you mount the pulleys!"
1,"Great concept, poor quality components","I just installed TWO of these bike lifts this afternoon. It's a great concept and works well, but it should not be up to the consumer to correct the quality issues as sold by the manufacturer.In short: the world's softest, crappiest screws are included in the box for installation.It was all too easy to strip the the screw heads when installing and one actually sheared itself in half when about halfway in. Yikes. Luckily I had some very high strength SPAX wood screws on hand (each good for 400lbs) that were easily used in place of the those provided.Without the poor screws I would rate this Bike Lift 4 or 5 stars but if I have to supply my own parts and move a lift to a different location because there's already a broken screw in the desired truss I'm knocking it waaaay down---particularly because quality screws are available so inexpensively.I would recommend this product as long you provide your own screws."
3,Racor PBH 1R,Works fine for the price. A lot of people complained about the quality of the rope but i decided if it became a problem I could easily replace it for less than 10 dollars. It's great if you only use the bike occasionally and just want it out of the way. Easy install.
4,Make sure you buy new screws,"Do yourself a huge favor and spend $2 and get new screws that won't strip. I followed the instructions regarding predrilling the holes and the screws still stripped. Took me 1.5 hours for install because of the poor screws. After I bought new screws, the second one only took 30 minutes to install.Once install, the lift worked great."
2,Operation not as smooth as it could be,"The type of rope used on this product needs to be improved. It can be frayed easily, especially if you often lift and lower your bike."
3,Uses Floor and Ceiling Space,"This product works fine, but is not very functional for everyday use. Although it does get the bike up off of the ground, you still need a clear area to hook it up, raise it, and lower it from... on the floor!So, if you use your bike every day, spend a little more money on (or make) a floor stand. For long-term storage, it's just fine, but consider a pair of well-placed rubber-coated hooks (through the rims), instead."
5,Works Great,"I bought 2 Racor bike hoists and they work great. Some buyers have mentioned their packages contained frayed ropes, as did mine. Nonetheless, all works well and I would purchase this product again."
2,Buy Hooks instead,"Like others have experienced, the cords fall apart. A better solution is to buy two large hooks that screw into the ceiling studs, and hang the bike upside down by the rims. There are hooks that have rubber covers and do a better job than the Racor lift."
3,$19.62 for space saving,I am keeping my bike in my bedroom where I have no floorspace to spare so I am going to have to look up at this every night. This is not the lowest priced option. I have seen $12.99 for other brands.
4,Great for saving space!,[...]It can lift your bike to the ceiling and lock it in place for easy storage.
1,The bike has not moved since I attached it to my ceiling.,I needed to find a piece of wood to attach the rack to and attach that to my ceiling. Then I had to hammer the hooks so that the seat would not fall off half way to the roof. Since it was hairy getting the darned thing up I haven't had the guts to take it down. My poor bike has cobwebs! I wouldn't recommend this product.
1,Please do not buy,"I would not wish this product on an enemy. It was a nightmare to install. I have a horrible kink in my neck and a headache. I would compare this project to Michaelango painting the Sisteen Chapel but at least he was able to lay on his back. The brackets weigh a pound a piece and there is no easy way to install. They kept falling on my head. I tried pre drilling the holes, but how can a person try to screw in a screw while also holding this one pound bracket straight. Then the screws are like boars tusks and would have punched into my upstairs bedroom. I ended up using some nails and small screws. Nightmare to install. Not worth the cost or trouble."
4,Does a good Job,"I like The solid construction i. e. solid for what is intended, lifting bikes... Not motorcycles, boats or anything else, heavier than let's say 30-40 lbs at the most.The rope is not a good quality one, it rags easily, marks your fingers in black when pulling or lowering the bike. If that's not something you can bear with, the rope is easily replaced with a better one. Other than that, good value for the money."
4,"Up, Up, and Away",I purchased 2 of these in an effort to clean up my garage. I was able to get the bikes up and out of the way. Installation was fairly simple although the brackets did not line up to studs. This is probably because your installation requires you to base placement off each bike.I got a couple of toggle bolts and we were in business. Very easy to maneuver the bikes up and down.
5,Beem me up,"What a great product. I mounted two of them to ceiling studs. My only complaint is that it did not come with enough plastic 'molly' spreaders for the side holes of the mounting bracket, nor enough screws. I used my own."
5,Racor Bike Lift,"I love this thing. I have 2 of them and it is very easy to install. The best thing about it is the ease of getting your bike on and off the unit. Also it is very usefull that when you are putting up or taking down the bike, if you let go of the cord the bike will stop comming down. Very Safe even my 8 year old can get my bike down for me..."
5,Great Product and Great Value,"I bought these because of the generally very good reviews. One concern expressed by some was the quality of the rope supplied with the lifts. I just got mine and the quality of the rope looks good. Maybe they have responded to previous concerns.Installation was pretty straight forward. The suggested video on the internet was helpful. I had to install some 1"" x 6"" boards to go perpendicular to my joists which made it a little more complicated but the directions were great."
5,Easy to Install!,Very easy to install and mount on the ceiling. Has really opened out the garage for more storage and open space. The rope could be much better but for average use it works just fine.
4,Racor Bicycle Hoist,"I installed two of the bicycle hoists in my garage and they are pretty good. They seem more that adequate to hold the bikes. Of the two systems, one of the ropes arrived frayed in 4 places and the company is sending me another one. The instructions could be clearer on threading the rope through the pulley lock. Over all well satisfied."
5,Easy and Clean Install,I did install two of these on both sides of my garage. Once u have taken the measurements right (for in between the hangers) - I dont see where you can go wrong with the install. Looks very clean and efficient.
5,great purchase,"bought 2 of these to store bicycles in our new garage. they were easy to install and work exactly as advertised. great product, good price"
5,Great Product,I purchased three of these to hang our bikes. It was easy to install and easy to use and the price is right. Can't go wrong with this product.
3,A good product but not necessary.,"I bought this contraption to keep my new bike from getting beat up. It took a few trips up and down the ladder to get it right. It works ok but it takes a half mile of rope to hoist the bike up. It looks like something the Egyptians invented to build the pyramids. What bothered me most was all the rope I had to screw with. After I used it a couple times I took it down and went to HD and bought two bike hangers for about 2.50 ea. They are really big hooks covered in rubber that screw to the ceiling. Now I just lift the bike up and hook the front wheel, then lift and hook the back wheel. It's a whole lot faster and you don't have all that stuff hanging down all over."
4,Works fine but not so easy to put up.,I bought 2 and put up only 1. Seems that the overhead work of finding the wood behind the wall and then screwing into it with the weight of the lift is not as easy as it looks on the video.
4,Good for the money,"The screws strip a little bit too easily during installation, and the rope is already starting to fray. However, it is pretty good for the money compared to other similar products."
4,Satisfied with product.,"We bought two of these for our bikes. After installation of the first, we were happy to install the second. They work as expected. I agree with other reviewers that the cord could be of better quality. I think it will fray easily. Installation was a snap and product arrived packaged well."
3,It works - BUT it has problems.,"I have 2 of these units in my garage with high ceilings, I can drive my car under the bikes once there up, and they do work but the problem is that the rope gets a kink in it and it wont release the bikes. So I have to get a tall ladder and undo the problem. That sucks, Also the rope falls off of the pulleys and gets jammed between the bracket and the wheel. If I didnt have these problems, Then I would rate it higher. Sorry to mad to type more."
5,rope is good,"I mounted this bike rack in the garage. It was easy after finding the stud and using the supplied bolts. Someone complained that the rope frayed easily and I found out why. The metal steel is punched out to make the hole that the rope is pulled through. This is the last part the rope goes through, then it held by hand to raise the bike. This punched out hole has sharp burs that snag the rope and will rip it up unless you file them off. The first time I pulled the bike up I knew it would be a problem so I deburred the hole and it works fine now."
5,Not only for bikes...for kayaks too!!,"I bought this on sale for $19 thinking that if it didn't work for my kayak, I'd use it for my bike and there would be harm done. Well, this thing is perfect for the kayak. Sure, there aren't hydraulic lifts or anything to help you lift it so it takes some effort, but for $19, who can complain?! The only modification for lifting the kayak was turning the hooks 180 degrees so that they face outward.We installed the lift above and perpendicular to the girders so that the kayak could be flush with the ceiling. It works like a charm. I'm sure the same could be done for bike use which would allow for another foot of space below the bike."
5,Great Bike Lift,There's nothing negative I can say about this Bike Lift. It does everything it says it will and it's easy to install.
5,Works as expected,"Installation was easy. Instructions are adequate and the provided screws are large enough to support the weight of your bike. Make sure to drill a pilot hole before screwing in the mounting brackets.I have installed 4 of these in our garage for our bikes and our son's big wheel. It wasn't necessary for the big wheel, but he was really excited about having his bike hung, so he wanted the big wheel up there as well."
4,Racor PBH -1R Ceiling Mounted bike,"Prudct received as stated, good quality, I would recommend to other if they need space savings and we received it on time ..great service."
3,Bike lift,"The device works as designed. Overall quality is decent. The only shortcoming were the screws that come with it. Each of them stripped out as I tried to attach the lift, even though I had predrilled pilot holes."
4,PBH hoists make some space.,This product fits my situation -- I refuse to park my cars outside when I have a (small) two-car garage. I also refuse to leave my bikes out in the rain. The hoists I purchased pulls the bikes out of the way. They are easy to get when my wife and I want to ride. They take care and a small amount of strength to use.
3,Fantastic for Tandems...may not be best for all garages...,"We have one on our tandem where it's absolutely incredible.For regular bikes it's hard to say whether you should get one.I'm 6' and can easily lift my bicycles over my head, so hooks work well. My wife isn't really comfortable with the rope hoists and prefers to have her bike on the ground.The rope latching mechanism is very nice and works well. The rope quality is iffy but after several years of use mine is still ok. Installation was tricky and I ended up drilling some holes in garage roof joists so I could install it exactly where I wanted it. Because you have to run a rope from one mount to the other, unobstructed, you may have to do the same if you're very specific where you want it."
3,Great idea but Poor quality,"I love the concept here but have an issue with the screws, rope, and rivets like many others. It's very obvious that these are made with the cheapest quality parts and yes they're from CHINA. I've got two of them up and functioning from the box but would certainly be nervous to leave a bike hanging over something valuable (like a car).Installation was very easy, I'd recommend that you install this to a 2x4 and then mount the 2 x 4 to your ceiling. It's very fast and easy (maybe 30 min)."
3,Quality,We purchased three bicycle hoists. One had a weak rope. We had to replace it after the first use. The other two are holding up well.
4,work well have suggestion,Work well and were relatively easy to install. I believe something should be said about finding a ceiling joist to anchor in.
2,Get ready to shred some hardware!,"You've read the other reviews about how the rope is cheap and the hooks aren't really hooks. Well, the screws are garbage, too. I ended up replacing every one of them and am just thankful that I was able to get the shredded ones out."
1,Rope broke twice,"The brake system seems to be a defective design, cutting the rope twice. The company replaced the rope quickly the first time (great service), but I am afraid to use the lift now because a bike could fall on someone's head."
1,"Flimsy, bike tipped a lot while hoisting","Picture looks like the one we bought previously. But this model relies on the bike to balance itself while hoisting. Naturally one end tips high going up. Could not independently control front height and back height while hoisting. Hooks were flat, so we were concerned the bike might slip off. Returned the product and bought a competitor's product that fulfilled all our expectations, and did not have these problems."
5,Awsome,"These are great, I use 2 sets to hold up our canoe in my small garage. Very easy use, I can lower and raise my canoe by myself in no time at all with very little effort. Awsome, sure beats parking outside. Everything arrived on time and intact and instructions were easy to follow."
1,Needs a better quality rope,The rope is terrible and the measurements for how far the device measures from ceiling to hook bottom should be stated so you can tell if you will have head/car top clearance.
3,good product,This bike lift seems to be good. It fits our area and works well. I'm not sure as of yet how it will preform long term. Will let you know as I continue to us it.
4,"Good price, easy to install",Finding right studs of garage ceiling is the only thing to consider. Included rope doesn't look solid to hold in first hand but it just does enough for my 25 pound mount bike.
5,Bike lift ceiling mounted (Racor),"Product does what is advertised. It was easy to set up, is reliable and for a 12 foot ceiling or higher is perfect for a bike where you can walk under it even at 6'4"". 2 Bungee cords make the hooks for the handle bars and seat fail safe."
4,Out of the way,"This is a product. Easily gets the bikes up off the garage floor and out of the way. The mechanism latches kind of like a window blind: Pull one way to latch, the other to release. Brilliant."
4,"Unexpected, but good.","Someone reviewed the other import version of this and had a similar background to mine: I originally heard the YY28s as part of the soundtrack to the PC game Test Drive 4. It was, without a doubt, one of the finest game soundtracks ever.This album is definitely good and worth owning, but it's far different than the style exhibited on the game soundtrack. Definitely more 80s-sounding... some tracks a little cheesy, but everything is ultimately likeable. Support your underdogs and buy this... and if you're unsure, buy it from one of the Amazon marketplace folks. :)"
4,Only the best Jenufa by default,"Mackerras, not an inspired conductor, has devoted himself to Janacek's operas and very honorably set them down in good Decca sound with accomplished casts. So far, so good. But if any of Janacek's stage works deserves a blazing interpretation, this is it. On a live concert recording under Eve Queller on Sony, the orchestra and sonics aren't nearly as good as here, but Leonie Rysanek gives an astounding performance as the grandother, and that's enough inmy mind to push that version past this very well done one."
1,"If you want to pass the upgrade exam, find another book.","This book glosses over and even omits important topics covered in the 529 Exam for Novell. Even with the supplemental materials recommended by Novell, you miss too much of the required content. Yes, I did pass the exam but I would give very little credit to the book."
1,This book smells bad...,"This book stinks! This book does not prepare you for the exam. For example, it states different system requirements than stated by Novell. It also leaves a lot to the imagination regarding real world setup and configuration. It doesn't go into enough detail about NSS, NLS, DNS. These people should owe me 100 bucks!"
2,Not Willing to Risk $95 After Reading This Book,"This book inadequately prepares you for the Certification test. Considering the questions that were asked during the test which I heard from other CNE's, I would like to get an alternate book, and get my money back for this ""outline"". Certainly, with my knowledge of NetWare 5 from the book, I won't risk putting down $95 for certification."
3,Not a bad book.....,"This wasn't the strongest Sybex book I've ever purchased, but it worked well when used with other resources. Not a bad book. Keeping in mind that this book is written for the experienced IT professional, after all, you are supposed to be a CNE already, it covers what it needs to. It makes the points of what will be on the test and does an adequate job of it. The practice tests were probably the most useful portion of the book.Remember that the purpose of this book is to assist you in passing the test, not to be a real world reference. If you want a real world reference manual, buy a Netware 5 reference book, not a test study guide."
1,"Just summary, no details.","I used the Sybex books on variety self study subjects, and my experience was very positive. But it is not on this one. The 529 test is the best-written one among those I has passed. It covers almost everything about NetWare 5. This book is far short on subjects."
2,Book does not cover Exam topics Well,I recently purchased and read the mentioned guide and I must admit there is not enough information in this guide for the exam. The book is a good pre exam refresher but nothing more.
4,A note from Maureen Farquhar,"'Confessions of a Pretty lady' consisted more of observations than of confessions, but the wit of Bernhards writing made this a pleasureable book to read. Like a emotional journey through Bernhard's personal life I felt a divine sense of identification with her (which is stange as we are worlds apart - she a sexually ambiguous jewish comidienne - me a Huyton socialite). My only problem with the book was its minimal length, the book con be easily read in one evening, but dont let this stop you as 'Confessions' is one of those books that you can read again and again. Dont be put of by Bernhards often uncomprimising image, this book will be rewarding to all who have chance to read it. ciao,Maureen Farquhar (maureenfarquhar@yahoo.com)"
2,Very small,"Item is very very small.....size of a Beennie Baby. Surely not the size in the picture. Not unique,saw one at Thrifty White for 12.00. It took over a week from the time I ordered to the time it was sent, and then another week.Will not be buying from this seller again."
4,Simple Destruction,"I bought this game for my 10 year old son. I have purchased a large number of used MechWarrior pieces for him, but we found it difficult to learn how to play. I decided to purchase the starter kit and it did just that--got us started."
5,Superb!,"The book ""We'll never forget you Roberto Clemente is one of my favorite books! The book is about a baseball player who is so good that a lot of teams want him and they offer him huge money bonuses. Roberto first joined the Brooklyn Dodgers but then the Pittsburgh Pirates picked him to play for them. He played in the major leagues for many years. Throughout his life Roberto got to the All Star Game, the National League, and the World Series. He also won the Most Valuable Player award. He was one of the players with 3,000 hits! Roberto helped win all of the games he was in. The sad part is the ending. When you start reading this book you can not put it down. It's very exciting! I loved it! While I was reading the book I kept cheering on the Pittsburgh Pirates. Every page is exciting. Read this book. Highly recommended. I give this book 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!"
1,give this book to your not-so-bff,"I picked up this book in a small free library. The more you read it, the more ridiculous it gets. Didn't get too far into the book before ditching it."
2,"Not that great, gets slightly better at the end","Seriouslly, this book is NOT that good. I got it for 1.75 at a B&N; severe clearnace rack, so, that should tell you something. I only got it because I needed a cheap read before work one morning, but, enough about me!This book is pretty much boring as heck in the start. I thought when she gets busted, it would be for something huge, like, the Chloe blouse the bookjacket talks about. Not for socks and a Chrystler Building. Book gets better at the end when she start shoplifting for a ring of theives. Ending was kind of boring. Too predictable and quite frankly, to campy."
5,That Mother !,"The Booster is great story telling and characterization. Jillian has so many facets to her personality. You want to love her, because she obvioiusly needs it. I know her mother. You want to slap the devil in her around, because she obviously needs it. I am that mother. She is spoiled, self-involved, but so inately tender, while she struggles with the life that encompasses her. As she gradually becomes fully evolved, you are hoping for a happy ending. She will use all that she has learned from that mother's lifestyle and her upbringing to succeed in the rest of the life laid before her. I really enjoyed Jillian's journey. Hmmmm, this book may spell out how one of the young women in my office wears designer clothes........that and the fact that she is unmarried and without children."
1,What happened here?,"As a tried and true Kirk Whalum fan, I am quite perplexed as to why this CD was cut. It is completely void of this man's true talent and not one track, in my opinion, even hints at the soulful and emotional way he usually plays his horn. As one of my favorite artists, it pains me to say, ""Why did you bother?"""
3,I don't know how you can call something original.......,"Now even Kirk Whalum has been affected by ""BONEY-ISM"".... Excuse my perception, but if you have your own distinctive voice like Whalum does and you come off sounding like someone else then you lose some of your originality and genuiness. There are actually a few remakes on this album and as evidenced with ""For You"", Brown and Whalum shined these hits up and gave them a different perspective. Paul Brown is a fine producer but in the future he's gonna have to leave his cookie cutter at the door. This is an average CD at best...you simply expect more from Kirk Whalum....."
4,"While Not Kirk's Best Work , It's Still Worth Buying...","Kirk whalum is one of the best smooth jazz sax players out there the cd "" Unconditional "" is not his best work --- it is one of his better cd's kirk whalum is also a great gospel musician and adds this aspect of his playing and musical background into his cd's and that is one of the things that stops me from giving this cd 5 stars because it takes away from the smooth jazz aspect of the cd's and starts to change the genre if you do not mind this I would suggest listning to kirk's "" In this life "" cd , but if you want to hear more of a smooth jazz style try "" The best of Kirk Whalum "" .."
3,"It's Hard to Top ""For You""","This CD isn't bad, but I think Kirk Whalum really out did himself on his last album ""For You"" and this one doesn't quite measure up. There are a few nice tracks on this one; I particularly like #1, #4, and #8. But as a whole, he set the bar too high."
3,Not His Best Work,Kirk is very talented but this CD was not his best. Hopefully the best is yet to come
3,Carving Traditional Fish Decoys,"The book was O.K., but not what I was looking for. Thought it would give some details on painting the finished project. It would have been better if I could preview, before purchasing."
2,Text for inorganic class,The book gets a little confusing at times. I am not sure if it's simply the topic of the way in which it was written
2,Gaps,"This is my first review of a book in Amazon. The problems in the book do not always illustrate the concepts that are presented in the chapters. Some of the concepts (and their corresponding examples) could certainly have been more elaborated with more steps and reasoning (i.e. contour maps, and radial distributions). The problems are redundant and tedious (i.e. there will be three to five problems out of forty that go over the same concept without going much in depth). And lastly, the book is oddly organized (i.e. quantum numbers are introduced at the beginning of the book and not talked about until Chapter 11, where they pop up again for multi-electron atoms). In summary, if you are an undergraduate student do not use this book as your main learning reference."
3,student review,"The language of the text is decent, ie somewhat easy to follow. Not enough detailed examples and problems. I used this book for my first quarter of Inorganic Chem, and my second quarter inorganic prof. refused to use it."
2,Not a good Inorganic chemistry text,"I am a chemistry major and have used this book for both semesters of Inorganic chemistry. If you have had quantum mechanics prior to reading this book it may be more helpful. However the extensive reference to point-groups and character tables is way overdone, only because the book does a horrible job of explaining point-groups and the creation of character tables. Our prof had to constantly omit sections from the book because it often overcomplicated many concepts.This book was far more helpful the second semester inorganic where the constant reference to point groups decreased somewhat. The concepts explained in the second half were also much more readable.Needless to say this was one of the few chemistry texts I have sold back, since I know I can find other more useful texts as references."
4,1st year inorganic chemistry text,"This was the book used for 5.03 (Inorganic Chemistry I) at MIT for Spring 2004. I thought it was a great book in terms of examples and explanations of point groups & molecular orbital diagrams. A lot of the chapters seemed to be organized such that the essential information was presented first, followed by applications and interesting side notes for each of the topics. This was very helpful when skimming before the final! I also recommend the solution manual!!"
2,Too Dense for Undergrads,"This textbook is a paradigm in the art of conciseness: while I admire Miessler and Tarr's ability to convey the massive amount of every chapter in so few pages, it makes for extraordinarily difficult. My professor thought this would be a useful text to cover our introductory class, as it does not waste time on basic information on periodicity, etc. However, after a few weeks of telling us what not to read (as it was far too abstruse), and resorting to other textbooks, she had to give up altogether on this one. I imagine this work's chief usefulness will come to graduate students needing a ""refresher"", but not to anyone else. There are too few grainy pictures, questions that rarely relate to the material in the chapter, and a text whose density rivals the Bible."
3,Crappy buy for the money,"I suppose you could say the book covers a wide range of complicated material, but that's pretty much it. It's extremely convoluted, an explanations are generally very poor. I had to search Google for supplementary links that actually explained most of the major concepts.Not recommended."
2,Brevity at the expense of clarity,"The answer key was often unhelpful, as it abbreviates or omits many parts that are key to understanding a solution. I found that the practice problems I could do from the textbook were limited by the answers I could actually follow. It is an exercise in understanding the authors' trains of thought, rather than the actual chemistry."
5,Excellent and Pragmatic,"Tal Ben-Shahar presents a 70-minute overview of the topic of ""positive psychology"" which is a growing field of study within the field of psychology. While this video is presented by a Harvard professor, it is geared toward a general, non-science audience and it packs a lot of great information into a short period regarding what it takes for people to be happy even when dealing with the challenges of life. Everyone can gain insight from this presentation. Ben-Shahar offers practical advice with scientific research to back it up. The theory of positive pyschology is ""founded on the belief that people want to lead meaningful and fulfilling lives, to cultivate what is best within themselves, and to enhance their experiences of love, work, and play."" (Penn University) It's completely within reach.This isn't pop psychology; it's science."
4,Did you ever think you'd find a book with TOO MUCH nudity?,"This book is positively fascinating for about the first half. You find out about the ""nude dance"" craze of the Weimar Republic and the dancers/dances/movements it inspired.However, Toepfer's work is SO complete, SO intricate, it comes off more like a doctoral thesis than a book.As pure reportage, it's a fine volume. But I kept waiting for some kind of idea of what the author thought about all of this; was it fascinating or does he just think it was weird? We never really find out.Still, some of the images he leaves you with makes you wish you could transport yourself back to some of these obviously sensual and often bizarre performances to see them for yourself.If you're a fan of dance history, or a nudist, I recommend this book. But don't be surprised if you put it down long before you finish; this is definitely more than most people would really want (or need) to know."
1,Dry and boring,"I wanted to read this because, on the whole, I love the Narnia books but I could only get through about half of it and the rest I skimmed through. Incredibly boring and not enlightening at all."
4,Ame Son - 'Primitive Expression' (PID),"Until fairly recent, I've never even remotely heard of this obscure French psychedelic / space rock band. 'Primitive Expression' was originally released in 1976, and every bit as good as their first (and only) album on CD reissue 'Catalyse' (see my review). Thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful ""Le Grand Cirque De La Lune"" (stellar flute work), ""Comme Est Morte I'Evocation"", the awesome six-part ""Je Veux Juste Dire"" and the straight-forward rocker ""Sweet Georgia"" the most. Title has eleven tracks - averaging four minutes each for your listening pleasure. Recommended."
1,This is made in China and is really poor quality.,This is made in China and is really poor quality. The castings are missing metal and the machining is very rough. I have one from 25 years ago and it was well made at that time. The one I purchased is being returned for a refund.
1,Piece of junk,"Don't waste your money. These things are so cheaply made that they can't even make it to my home by mail without breaking (went through two of them this way). We're seriously talking below dollar-store quality here. Edelbrock should be ashamed. I opted to not bother having a third sent--after all, if it can't even make it through UPS, can I really expect any sort of accuracy from this thing?"
3,"Useful, but not profound","As advertised, the book is an overview of what academic researchers have learned about influence in organization. It doesn't offer any startlingly brilliant insights, and is more academically-oriented rather than practicioner-oriented. I'd advise buying Cialdini's ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion"" instead!"
4,"Good, but not great.","In terms of quality, they are only beat by the Masters deck. These cards are smooth and crisp, making fans and flourishes more satisfying than ever. The black background definitely adds an eerie and mysterious feel to the deck, drawing attention anywhere I pull them out. This makes for a great ice breaker at parties, especially when you want to attract that one girl's attention.However, as I already said, its quality does not compare to that of the Masters deck. Also, the red-pipped Tiger deck looks much better than this black and white deck. The red on black color scheme adds so much to the beauty and artistic feel of the cards that I don't understand why Ellusionist even sells the colorless version.Overall, it gets a 7/10, because by itself, it is certainly an amazing deck. But if you are going to buy a Tiger deck (which you definitely should, as they are worth every penny), go for the red-pipped one because they are worth it at even twice the price.- Bubloo (bubloox)"
4,"Good CD, though uneven","I recommend this CD solely on the strength of 6 tracks. Tracks 1,2,3,4,5, and 12, make this album worth every penny. Maybe that's why some of these are the sample songs? These are soulful grooves that are engaging and unique. Though other tracks are pretty [weak], these 6 made the album one of my recent favs. ..."
4,Great CD - Very listenable,"I bought this CD a few weeks after I purchased the Hidden Beach compilation. I must admit, Jill Scott's inclusion is what initially prompted me to purchase the CD; but I was pleasantly surprised by the rest of it. The lesser-known artists really set it off, while Erykah Badu, The Roots, and Ms. Scott cement a stellar effort. I was also very impressed with Nelly Furtado and am looking forward to more of her work in the future.Quite simply, this is music to live and love by. If you don't have it, get it...NOW!!"
3,Two and a half stars....ok maybe three but that's it.,"It's an OK album. I was expecting it to be better because of artist line-up (Erykah, Amel, India Irie, The Roots, Jill Scott, Sunshine Anderson, etc)Favorite tracks are ""Today"",""Butterfly"", and ""Don't Stop"". I would NOT go out and spend my last twenty bucks on it....but if it was given as a gift.... I'd keep it. If for no other reason it would be for Badu's ""Today""."
3,Smooth atmosphere music,"The stand-outs of this CD are Erykah Badu's beautiful ""Today"" and India.Arie's sweet ""Butterfly"" and Nelly's (an artist who I usually don't care for)""Legend"". The rest of the music seemed to linger on the same styles and kept me interested only as background music in my house. I was disappointed in my girl, Jill Scott for contributing that awful remix of her magnificent ""Long Walk"". And why did they have to put in Macy Grey's Daffy Duck voice in here? Overall, it's worth buying this CD for the first three songs I've mentioned."
3,Not worth its weight,"I brought this book to Japan and packed it all over the country for two weeks before we got to Tokyo. I had read positive things about it online, and tried to follow the tour of Ginza as described in the book. It was extremely confusing, and after only much effort I managed to find the sites described, which turned out to be extremely uninteresting (some souvenir stores going out of business). I then accidentally left the book at a SegaWorld and was not able to find it again. No great loss. I would give it fewer stars if I hadn't lost the book - I am giving it the benefit of the doubt!"
3,too old,"I have just arrived into Tokyo to live here for 6 months and was thrilled to find this book on the shelves within the apartment.Every one of the tours that was described looked like areas that I would like to explore during my time here. Unfortunately, during my first exploration the first two stops were no longer located in the same area. This made the walking tour quite a waste of time.Excellent book that should be updated."
3,Review,"It's a fun book if you like 18th-C. Lit. Lots of repetition. But it's public domain, so you can just read it online if you want to save money."
4,Good Kaminsky--overlook the TV aspect,"When I first heard about this book, I said, ""Oh, no; Kaminsky's whoring himself out to the TV people."" He has, of course, written TV material before, but I always thought his Lew Fonesca and Abe Lieberman books were far superior. (I was in Sarasota a while back, and I went to Fonesca's corner late one night and saw the Dairy Queen. Very spooky!).As it turns out, Kaminsky wrote this ""CSI"" book with his usual aplomb, and it's a good one. But it's a lot more gory than his usual stuff--in keeping with the theme of the show--with lots of forensic details, etc.There's a Jewish theme--which is Kaminsky's home turf--running through the story, and it makes for an interesting crime scenario.This book is more formulaic than usual, due to requisite demands of a TV series, but Kaminsky is a still a great storyteller."
1,Very disappointing,"This is the third book in a row that's been a bummer, so I am going on a vegan book stoppage! I found the recipes in this to be so unappetizing, so many reliant on tofu type ingredients instead of beans for a protein source. Yuck. Honestly I didn't find a single recipe I wanted to use so I am giving this book to the local thrift store, along with at least two others, if not more, In my new found passion for being a vegetarian, I have wanted to build up a great vegan library. Looks like I was lucky with my first ones, not so any more. I am very disappointed. And bothered I've spent money on these books."
2,"Covered Shape Sheets, but skipped VBA, too bad","Though shape sheets were covered, VBA was definitely not. It seems any serious application development would require at least VBA support. Basically, I need to get another book to solve my problem."
2,"""Advanced"" a misnomer","I was very disappointed that programming Visio with Visual Basic for Applications was ""too advanced"" for this so-called ""Advanced"" book."
1,Hmm,"I purchased this album strictly based on the fact Sundazed reissued it and it was from the 60's. It is a habit I have gotten into thanks to Sundazed reissuing lots of great albums beforehand; this isn't one of those albums.There is very little coherency to this jarbled mix of sound effects, random lyrics and horrendous singing,{if you can call it that}. It feels like some guys went out into a desert, got high, and made a bunch of rotten music. I could overlook the lack of lyrics if the music was good, but alas, it isn't.Avoid."
4,Enjoyed the performance,"I'm not a huge opera fan, but have heard snippets of this work over the years and was intrigued by the reviews. While I cannot say this is one of my favorites, I did enjoy it very much."
5,Excelente!!! Bravo Domingo,"Excelente grabación de la Carmen de Bizet, Domingo ejecuta a la perfección su rol del atormentado Don Jose, Troyanos nos hace sentir la pasion, amor, libertad y desden de una Carmen que nos ha cautivado por años. Te Kanawa muestra a una Micaela sumamente tierna (escuchen su dueto con Domingo en el primer acto, muestra al maximo el amor filial) y Van Damme es un Escamillo con presencia y señorio todo un Don Juan. Solti dirige esta Carmen combinando las 2 versiones de esta obra y con gran dramatismo. Haganse un favor y consiganla"
5,Carmen is good!,"I like Carmen but I don't have much paticite to listen to it. Even though, I give it 5 stars!"
4,Great for in-between cleanings,"These wipes are great for quick cleanings. Easy to use and leave a great shine. Just a note on the price...you can get them for almost half the price per container at wal-mart, as compared here."
5,Beautiful Aroma,This book is theoretical and practical. It speaks to the reader in a serious and simple tone. This book is great for readers who simply want to know the A B C of Sufism all the way to Z. It is a hand book that gives proper perspective and place to Sufism. The Poetry contained within the additional treatise is exceptional in that it reflects the sublime experiences of Truth that all seekers seek. The author has reached elevated hights and has brought back its fragrance. No one knows Sufism better than a Sufi Master who does not boast about with degrees and complicated terms.
1,the fragrance STINKS,What a horrible representation of Sufism and Islam. It appears as if this book was written by a three year old. Absolutely NO intelligent coherence or spiritual significance AT ALL. It is a shame that people like this turn the esoteric beauty of Sufism into a capitalistic endeavor. The author gives Sufism a bad name by using it as a propaganda tool for self-glorification.
5,THE BEST TURANDOT!,"THIS IS A TURANDOT WITH SUTHERLAND/PAVAROTTI/CABALLE, THE FINEST RECORDING OF TURANDOT IN THE WORLD. THESE REVIEWS SHOULD BE ABOUT TURANDOT, NOT A BATTLEGROUND FOR JEALOUS SILLS OR CALLAS FANS WHO HATES SUTHERLAND.ALSO THIS OPERA INCLUDES PAVAROTTI AND CABALLE. THEY ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT IN THIS PERFORMANCE AS SUTHERLAND. YET ALMOST EVERYONE TALKS ONLY ABOUT SUTHERLAND AND HER GREATNESS OR DOWNFALL.STOP THE BASHING! WHAT IS A BEVERLY SILLS/SUTHERLAND COMPARISON DOING IN REVIEWS OF TURANDOT? IT JUST AMAZES ME HOW SILLS AND CALLAS FANS ALWAYS TRY TO PUT DOWN SUTHERLAND BECAUSE OF SUTHERLAND'S OBVIOUS GREATNESS.YES, SILLS HAS A GREAT VOICE, BUT SHE CAN'T TOUCH SUTHERLAND AS TURANDOT OR ANY OTHER ROLE.YES, CALLAS WAS A GREAT ACTRESS, BUT SHE CAN'T TOUCH SUTHERLAND AS TURANDOT EITHER.THE ONLY DIVA WHO CAN MATCH SUTHERLAND AS TURANDOT ON CD IS BIRGIT NILSSON. THAT IS THE TRUTH, AND THAT'S FINAL!NOW LET'S STOP THE CHILDISHNESS AND DISCUSS PUCCINI'S TURANDOT!"
5,I Wish There Is a DVD for This Cast!!!,"I bought the recording in the tape form years ago. I could not listen to it any more because of the wear after I played it too many times. Fortunately, technology came to the resue, CD!!!The tenderness, emotion, range, and capacity, from a delicate note to a full blown key, Luciano Pavarotti's voice is from Heaven. No tenor recordings came close to the quality of singing of this one.Joan Sutherland is the sweetest Liu that I have ever heard. Better still, the voices of the two, Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pvarotti, were the best combination ever. Add to this, we get Montserrat Caballe as the princess.What more can one ask for?"
3,Kirsten Flagstad is the voice of the century!!!,"Kirsten Flagstad's voice must be considered the voice of the century. If she had sung and recorded ""Turandot"", she would be the best. Flagstad's voice was more beautiful than Sutherland's and it was several times larger than Sutherland's. Also, in her prime, her high C was even more beautiful than Sutherland's."
1,Sutherland is horrible!!!,"How anyone can say Sutherland is a ""10"" Turandot and Nilsson an ""8"" Turandot is beyond me. Sutherland is anemic when compared to Nilsson. Also, Sutherland never sang the ice princess on stage. Nilsson did many times. The rest of the cast and the conductor are great. This set loses only because of the miscast soprano in the title role."
4,BEAUTIFUL PERFORMANCES!,"Allthough I don't regard Turandot as Puccini's best Opera, it certainly has many very beautiful moments!Now, about this recording,I find it very satisfactory.I entirely dissagree that Sutherland and Caballe should have switched roles!How could Sutherland have given us a better Liu than the one Caballe has. Her performance at ""signore ascolta"" for instance is simply superb! Such performances make her one of the BEST SOPRANOS of the century! Sutherland ideal for the role of Turandot (bolth woman and Icy princess). As for Pavarotti there is no doubt that he is among the best Calafs ever!In comparison to the Nilson/Bjorling set , I find Bjorling/Tebaldi equal to Pavarotti/Caballe, but Sutherland slightly better than Nilson.On the whole,(the Suth/Pav set) a MORE FAMOUS recording od Turandot that's WORTH BYING!"
2,"Wow, to dismiss Nilsson like that!","Saying Nilsson shows no emotions at all as Turandot is a LIE. She is ice-cold in ""In questa reggia"", but melts very believably in the love duet. For the role of Turandot, it matters very much if the soprano in the title role in a recording of the opera has or has not sung the role on stage. Nilsson is in a class by herself as Turandot. For her, the high tessitura is child's play. Sutherland can definitely sing in higher tessituras than that of Turandot's, but she is not the ideal Turandot. Who says that a Turandot is supposed to have a beautiful soprano voice? That is not a pre-requisite for an ideal Turandot. Nilsson's voice is just as distinctive as Sutherland's and her high C's are just as powerful. She is the best Turandot on records. Those of you who bash her in the role are just ignorant."
3,Ghena Dimitrova rules as Turandot,"Dimitrova in her prime produced explosive top notes. They were huge. She is a much better Turandot than Miss Sutherland. That is the truth. Let us not forget the supreme Turandot of Birgit Nilsson.This set contains Pavarotti at his finest and Caballé at her ethereal best. She really is the better of the two sopranos on this set. Sutherland's many fans keep raving about the Australian diva's luscious, velvety tone. I much prefer the exquisite purity of Caballé's beautiful voice. Its overtones are like none other in the world. Caballé's voice is beyond beautiful. It is transcendental. Also, in her recording of ""Guillaume Tell"", Caballé executes textbook-perfect staccato scales at the end of Mathilde's aria ""Pour notre amour plus d'espérance""."
4,"Too bad, a good Turandot has NOT been made yet...","To put it short, for the same cast wouldn't it be better had Sutherland sung Liu and Caballe Turandot? Pavarotti is a well accepted Calaf for sure. Wish Maria Callas had left us a studio version before 1949... would be perfect had Pavarotti been born 10 years earlier so he could sing it with Callas... God, help us!"
3,Good except for Sutherland,"I bought this a long time ago, and I'm scandalized by the plethora of positive reviews.I was surprised by how whiny and pathetic Sutherland sounds. Perhaps it is the lack of runs and turns. Her Italian diction is horrible. Plus I hate how she attacks her notes, as if they are preceded by acciaccatura. She is evidently miscast. Nilsson spent her career defining Turandot. The verity and constancy of her notes are such a delight, and Sutherland's recording only serves to underscore this.On the other hand, Caballe was excellent. She is the best Liu I've ever heard. Her singing was particularly rousing. I wish she could make her breathing less audible though.The rest is OK. The audio quality is excellent."
4,Amazon promptly replace defective CD,"Good performance. CD had a ""dimple"" on the media side. Two tracks were unreadable. Getting a replacement from Amazon was easy and quick. Amazon e-mailed a postage-paid label. Slapped on on the box and dropped in a mailbox. Amazon promptly shipped a replacement. Painless and prompt."
5,Highly recommended,"This recording was recommended to me after an opera expert friend of mine suggested Callas in everything, and I was disappointed. So he said get everything with Sutherland, and so far, I am very glad with that. Sutherland does have a lovely voice, and I think so does Pavorotti. But most of all, the music is glorious. I like it better than Butterfly and La Boheme. This is truly highly recommended, I also recommend Sutherland's Lucia and Norma."
5,Brillian recording of Puccini's ultimate opera,"This Christian Reico is a Callas fanatic and basher of Callas' rivals. [...]Just because Callas' own ""Turandot"" recording is subpar does not mean that this person can bash other sopranos' recordings of this opera.Ignorant people like Christian Reico give opera fans a bad name. Shame on him for his hate-filled writing and soprano bashing."
5,The best Bob- Lucy movie ever.,A hilarious movie about a husband and a wife who fall in love. Only they are not married to each other.
5,yet another amazing album,"I waited in great anticipation for this album to be released and then I waited even longer for the Japanese import to make it stateside because it is 5 songs longer than the U.S. version. It was worth the wait! Personal favorites include ""And If I Fall"" which has a catchy tune and optimistic, I-want-to-change-the-world lyrics, ""Ballad of the Band"" with the Bjork-like backing vocals, ""A Man Needs to be Told"" with Tim Burgess' new falsetto vocals, ""Viva La Sociale"" which is an instrumental band jam (only on Japanese import), ""Is It In You"" and ""Love To You"" (also only on Japanese import)."
1,the worst charlatans cd--EVER!!,"hi there, i've been a big charlatans uk fan ever since ""some friendly"" was released. they've changed their sound/style before--but the changes used to be for the better only. i was dying for this cd to come out, and i couldn't have been more disappointed. that's all i can say. ""us and us only's"" promises go unfulfilled painfully! it seemed as if the charlatans were maturing and turning into something really special. this cd is on the same level as half-baked radio-pap bands like matchbox twenty. this is a complete waste of money...now i'm out $... avoid, avoid, AVOID!!!"
1,garbage. complete trash.,what the hell happened to the charlatans? since when do they throw us such trash and call it music? tim burgess should've stayed in england... ugh. DON'T BUY THIS!!!
4,Getting Better,"The Charlatans are begging to climb back to the top after a couple of rather low key albums. The Charlatans have managed to regain that raw edge that they had and through Tims vocals we have a top album. Standout tracks are Love Is The Key (1st single release), Your So Pretty, We're So Pretty, Wake Up, Judas, and Right On. I hope that they manage to maintain this level, as this is the band at their best"
2,a hunk of burning love?,"Being a serious Charlatans fan, most especially Between 10th and 11th, I have been increasingly disappointed with their albums through the years. While there are a couple of listenable songs here ""If I Fall"" and ""Right On"", Tim's falsetto on ""I Can't Get Over Losing You"" and ""Wake Up"" just grates on my ears. In addition, some of the lyrics are pretty weak. Check out ""..hunk of burning love.."" and ""...finders, keepers, losers, weepers...."". This band used to please me, but now I haven't got the time."
5,Sabbath Keeping,"I must say that this little book is really well written and full of ideas to help you do what God has asked us to do. I thought I had trouble with keeping this day, which ever one you choose, but have come to realize that there are several ways of doing it. Great book for book clubs to discuss.John P."
5,I dig this little book!,"This is a VERY COMPACT yoga book. I was actually surprised to see how small it is. The idea of doing yoga in your tent is a wonderful concept for us enthusiasts, however I'm not so sure the poses would would work on top of an air mattress, which I use in the tent."
3,"Good, but...","Buy this recording for Pavarotti; it is one of his best performances on record. However, There are other better overall recordings. Sutherland comes across as too old and matronly for Adina, and Bonynge's conducting is absolutely dull and lifeless. Malas and Cossa are just OK.If you really want to hear how this opera should be performed, get di Stefano's recording on Decca with Gueden, Capecchi, Corena, and Molinari-Pradelli conducting. Or, if you don't mind a live recording with decent quality stereo sound, get Bergonzi's recording with Scotto, Taddei, Cava, and Gavazzeni conducting. Both these recordings were a revelation for me after learning the opera many years ago with the Pavarotti/Sutherland version."
4,Pavarotti reigns supreme!,"Without a doubt, Joan Sutherland is a 'real' expert of coloratura singing. If only those so-called coloratura sopranos nowadays have but 60% of her prowess and skill, our ears will certainly fare much better.Having said that, in this recording, La Stupenda has started her long and slow downhill trend. Her brilliant timbre began to lose somewhat its bright and light quality that marked her the cream of the cream in coloratura singing. Of course, one must not mistakenly say that by having a slightly less radiant tone here, those so-called coloratura singers with dark and dull voices (Anna Netrebko, just to name one) could call herself 'comparable' with La Stupenda - no way!Pavarotti is absolutely brilliant in this performance. All the dynamics, all the different shades of tone, all the rhythmic nuances...I would only want to hear his 9 High Cs in Donizetti's other opera recording with Joan. The others are nothing but NOISE."
5,Best L'Elisir,"This is a wonderful recording of ""L'Elisir D'Amore"" by Donizetti. Luciano Pavarotti and Joan Sutherland are excellent as always and this recording has more life than others. Spiro Malas first Dulcamara very well, sounding very arrogant and coniving. The person who said he was the worst Dulcamara is an idiot. There couldn't be a better one. Moreover, L'Elisir D'Amore is an interesting opera, because, unlike most operas, it isn't a tragedy. It's a comedy, which is something you rarely see in operas. I suggest buying this L'Elisir recording."
3,Pavarotti at his best...but not much else.,"Pavarotti was born to sing Donizetti, his secure, silvery delivery is a model of its kind. His touching, vulnerable Nemorino must be next to Rodolfo, one of his best roles. La Stupenda is also very solid and very secure, I find her Adina a little uninteresting, but there is no denying her formidable vocalism. Dominic Cossa and Spiro Malas are quite frankly, not merely bad, but downright terrible. I can't remember a worse Dulcamara on record, why oh why DECCA hired him? I have no clue. Still, Pavarotti is much better here than in the too late DG remake. In that recording the genial Enzo Dara is Dulcamara, but Kathleen Battle is Adina, either you like her or hate her. I certainly agree with another reviewer on the excellent ERATO Elisir. Devia and Alagna are a delight, the Belcore and Dulcamara very competent, and it's expertly conducted by Marcello Viotti. You would be surprised how good it is."
2,Pity about Pavarotti,"Sure, Luciano is very good, he was in his prime and Nemorino suits his personality, but dear, everything else is grotesque. La Sutherland is incomprehensible, not a word is clear and sounds too old for Adina. The Belcore and Dulcamara are best forgotten. There are plenty of fine Elixirs, including the earlier DECCA recording with Di Stefano and Gueden. Another glorious rendition is Luigi Alva's with Serafin in EMI, which by the way has the finest Dulcamara and Belcore ever in Giuseppe Taddei and Rolando Panerai. But if you want an excellent modern recording go for Alagna's first try in ERATO, now at mid-price. Alagna pre-hype was fresh and winning, lovely voice sweet personality. But the real star of that recording is soprano Mariella Devia, the finest coloratura around. She gives SUCH an idiomatic performance in true Donizetti style, that for her alone I would buy that recording."
4,"Good performance, one serious flaw.","While overall this is an excellent performance with good sound, there is one serious flaw which will keep it from being just about anyone's first choice. To the point, ""Una furtiva lagrima,"" the most famous part of the opera and just about everybody's favorite, is absolutely butchered. Listen to diStefano's aching performance on the other Decca set( or Bergonzi or . . or . . or . .) and there is just no comparison. To be fair to Pavarotti, who I love and adore, this seems to be mostly Boyenge's fault.So while I don't want to completely steer people away from this set, the buyer should be aware that he or she will absolutely have to supplement it with another (going without a decent ""Furtiva"" is not an option). Given that the Pavarotti/Sutherland/Boyenge set is already full price, this could get expensive."
5,Ms Swinson Does It Again..but better,"I loved this book, stayed up all night to finish it only to find at the end that OMG..can't believe it! I can't believe that Kira actually snitched on her husband, I would've found other ways to ""pay him back"", without running to the FEDS. Secret indictments are never secret for long! I enjoyed Wifey, but I think this one was better..about to start book 3!"
4,Oh the drama!,"I love how Kira stood up for herself in this book but it seems to me that she really didn't learn anything from her previous experiences. This book was a bit predictable but great nonetheless. The drama was turned on high and was non stop! I loved it! The author left us with many unanswered questions but I'm okay with that since I know she will most likely clear everything up in her next installment of this series. My main complaint aboutWifeywas that the narration and dialogue was extremely hood and ghetto and I have to say, she made a big improvement in this book although she outdid herself with the typos in this time! My gosh, there we so many of them! Something about this novel is different then the other urban fictions I've had the pleasure to read and I would definitely recommend this book because of that and because of it's fast paced and super entertaining nature."
4,cold,the girl is scandlous and a back stabber. I she was wrong to go to the police. But it was a good book.
2,Just ok....,I was very dissappointed with this book. The story seemed very rushed and much of it didn't make sense. It really bothered me that the author jumped around from 1st to 3rd person.At times I was confused as to who was talking. I also had a problem with the numerous grammatical errors in this book as well. I'm not sure if I will be purchasing the next book.
2,A disappointment,"From the first book, Wifey, to this? I truly was not pleased with this book. It seemed rushed and just not well developed. In fact, much of the book was predictable.Had the author gone a different route, I think she could have carried this storyline for at least another book if not a couple more, especially by further developing Nikki's and Rhonda's characters (and a creative writer still would). I never did get a clear understanding of what happened to them.I can understand wanting to put out a sequel while the initial story is fresh in the reader's head, in fact, I applaud Ms. Swinson for that. However, it should not be done unless the story can be fully developed enough to become a quality novel.If the author chooses to further develop the other characters of this book or wishes to write future novels, I would suggest she read and study LaJill Hunt's novels, as she does an excellent job with her sequels and development of other characters within her different storylines."
4,Part 1 was way better!,"Now I don't even know where to start wit part2, part1 was better to me. KIKI did her thang put the words to the paper, but I was mad that every body ended up dead so there aint gonna be no part3 unless o'l girl didn't really die you know how these authors now days be making stuff happen."
4,Part 2 was better than 1,"I have to say. I thought that Still Wifey was great. I enjoyed the book. It was way better than Part 1, and there were not a lot of errors. The first one was messed up, but she steped up to the game and did her thing."
3,how are ya still wifey!,"well im still wifey was not at all what i expected it to be, And kira played her self once again i just dont see how she could go from wifey to being just like a side line chick thats crazy. and as for ricky he played his self too thats not how a real gangsta get down no SNITCHING!! but all in all it keeps you wondering whats going on and whats go happen."
3,Okay. But not what I expected,"I read all 3 of the Wifey books, Wifey, I'm Still Wifey and Life After Wifey. They were ok, but I expected alot more from them. I read them in 2 weeks and usually if something is really good to me I read it allday and night even at work. I took a little longer with these."
3,Not what you expected,The book was ok I thought it would have been a little better then that! Better luck next time!
2,Just Alright,"I read Wifey and absolutely loved the book! The ending was great and that just shows how you can get played in the game! However, I'm Still Wifey kind of sent me for a loop, she went from acting like she loved her man, to hating him, I understand how she feels but to go on to become a SNITCH that was a little deep, and then to check for the dude Mike that had a women, which went against everything she believed in with her husband really got me! I think the author is great I met her, but I'm still Wifey was not what I thought it would be!"
5,Great tips!,This is a great little book with many useful tips for different types of grasses. It is a great reference! I would recommend this to anyone who is just starting out with a bad lawn. It will give quite a few pointers on nursing your lawn to where it will be a lawn of envy!
5,Love it and not just because I'm a Red Sox fan,This is a great book that covers the how's and the why's. It's an easy and quick read too. Great book.
2,Not what I had hoped for,"I wasn't very impressed with this book. I already have the Scotts lawn care book and loved that one. Since this book is by Fenway's greenskeeper, I expected even more detailed and in-depth advice. Instead this book covers the same basic topics in any lawn book with no extra helpful advice. In fact, in many cases the information was not as detailed as other books.Several of the tips have nothing to do with being a home lawn owner. For example, one tip suggests using a certain enhancing chemical. When I looked up the chemical, it turned out it is only available to professionals and actually costs hundreds of dollars per gallon. How does that help me at home?? In another example tip given, a groundskeeper talks about re-soding after games. Again, I am not sure how that helps me know what to do at home.I suggest buying the Scotts lawn care book instead of this one. That book is much more of a ""bible"" than this book is."
5,"A practical, easy-to-follow, ""can-do"" guide","The Lawn Bible: How To Keep It Green, Groomed, And Growing Every Season Of The Year by David R. Mellor (Fenway Park's Master Groundskeeper) is a superbly organized, ""user friendly"" resource filled with tips, tricks, and techniques for creating and maintaining a greener lawn. From preparing the soil with compost and fertilizer; to waging war against weeds and pests; to presenting a wide variety of seasonal grasses ideal for homeowners with an eye toward presentability; and a great deal more, The Lawn Bible lives up to its name and is enthusiastically recommended as a practical, easy-to-follow, ""can-do"" guide for the novice lawn gardener."
3,Nicely written and informative - but no pictures,"This is my first lawn book - bought to help me with my first lawn. I found it well written with plenty of helpful advice and guidance. D. Mellor stars the book by teaching you how to listen to your lawn - and figure out what it needs. He goes into detail about the different kinds of grass available, and which grow best in what locales. He discusses different aspects of mowing, watering, reseeding and renovating, and weeding. He also gives instructions at what he is most famous for, mowing with patterns.However, I don't think a lawn book can be complete without pictures. How will I know that I need to treat a ""plantain"" infestation, if I don't know what ""plantains"" look like? How do I know what ""Sulfur cinquefoil"" looks like?Pictures are worth a thousand words."
3,Too Small for me.,"I sent this back. It is a good watch, but the face was a little small for my wrist. also, the hour markers and hands are a little too contemporary for me. I settled on the Bracer by ESQ."
5,Longest-lasting I've ever used,"Years ago, I went skiing and found myself putting on Carmex EVERY SINGLE TIME I got on the lift. That stuff just couldn't handle the snow, wind, and cold. I bought a container of this stuff at the pro shop. I put it on ONCE and didn't need any more for the rest of the day! One container lasted more than 3 seasons. I can't imagine using anything else - especially for outdoor activities."
3,5 stars for product/ no stars for price!,"I love Dermatone, I can't live without it! It is the best lip protection ever (I used to get really stressed out watching LOST because I imagined myself stuck on a desert island with no Dermatone).I obviously somehow missed the price, or assumed it was for a multi-pack or something!This was $10.45 it retails for less than $3.00.RIDICULOUS"
5,The Burning Paris - gone but not forgotten,"A beautiful post-rock album that I decided to check out on a whim. Unlike most post-rock bands however, these guys use progression throughout their songs wonderfully, with almost whispered vocals accompanying them. It's beautiful stuff.For those interested with this band, they've unfortunately broken up. This ep and their full length entitled ""Coral City Ruin"" is all of their discography to my knowledge. Some of the members went on to form the band ""On Fire"" however, which I strongly recommend checking out."
4,Pretty good book,"William Fitch Minstead is a man who just recieved a major shock thanks to Hilary Compton. He is a father due a past affair. Fitch is a man knows what he wants and he want to be with his daughter, so decided to married the woman he has been raising his daughter. So now Hilary goes from a country miss to the new Countess of Ackerman.""He said Now"" is the first book tha have read from Patricia Waddell and it was pretty good read. Ms. Waddell makes her characters real with real emotions. The only reason that I did not give five stars is that the ending was not very strong."
4,Another Great Roundup in the Bargrooves Series,Another excellent disc of tasteful house & classic house tracks. The Bargrooves may be the most consistent series of house music out there - always tasteful and excellent - this one might contain the sexiest tracks for the just after midnight crowd :-)
2,Yuck!,"This band was great (or at least really good) in the early 90s. I thought they were going places. Unfortunately, a series of lineup changes and a move towards more computerized music altered their sound. This is a must to complete the CDS collection, but not one you'll listen to a lot."
4,Congluence of many different contemporary rock styles,"Leitmotif stems from many different hard rock styles incorporating them into an instrumental dominated album. Yet what separates Leitmotif from copycat labels is its ability to merge the sounds, from acoustic chords to driving riffs, into a greatly constructed album as a whole. Indeed the individual songs are great, but don't play this album on shuffle or you're cheating yourself. This is a great CD for driving, partying, or smoking."
4,A sound for sore ears (for the most part),"The music world today needs Dredg. Their music is unique and uncompromising. Their style is distinct and defined. Their songs are complex yet clear. Throughout the album you'll hear many beautiful musical pieces. And their songs are inspiring and spiritually uplifting.The downfall of this CD is the vocals. While lead singer Gavin does sound very sincere, his voice (on this CD at least... El Cielo is a different story) is decent at best... but sometimes he really doesn't sound good, especially when screaming. He doesn't scream often, but it would have been better if he hadn't screamed at all.One other shortcoming is that there's only about 40 minutes of music.All in all, a very good CD, which re-introduces good music to the world. Definately worth owning."
3,"2 and a half actually, highly overrated album","I just had to say something. I picked this one up when i heard that it was 'supposed' to sound like a cross between tool and radiohead. Well not quite. The album isn't all bad but I get the impression that they're trying very hard (TOO hard) to sound 'intelligent'. Go have a listen to get what I mean. While the music is decent tho', the vocalist isn't. All in all an average album. Highly overrated."
2,not good,"This is just another not as good as the original copycat band. i think people want to like something that is not well know so they write these amazing reviews. This album is average at best. All the songs sound shallow and fake. The guitar is repetetive and the bass player is flat out boring. Dino is decent on the drums, but by no means above average for a profesional musician. If you want to impress people by listening to something that isn't on MTV then this might be the album for you, but if you are looking for a good album you won't find it here."
5,Groundbreaking,"I remember listening to tracks online before this album came out and just thinking it was amazing. I remember going to get the CD the day it was released, 9-11. The local community college I was attending closed early due to what had happened in NYC and I caught the record store just before the mall closed for the same reason. I listened to this album several times and reflected on what had just happened on 9-11 and it gave me a sense of reality, but also gave me a sense of peacefulness. This album was nothing like other albums by other bands, but a complete work of art."
4,Leitmotif is a good explanation,"Surprising music they make! I think the album title was cleverly chosen since a Leitmotif is a pattern that is repeted. That is how their music is created too.I like the presence of the drum. Guitar is nice, especially in song ""Movement II"", it's like a slanging match between a man (singer) and a woman (guitar) but I find the distortion destroys it a bit. I like when they're playing with effects like in ""Movement IV"", cool delay there.The lost star on the rating is because of this:Singing is strange to extremes. Sometimes he screams (luckily, the mic is pretty far from singer) or it is only background noise from which you can reconized words here and there. Please don't compare his singing to Maynard James Keenan, Keenan's voice is so much more.I hate when they use distortion on the guitar. They should get away from that. It does not fit with the rest of the music."
5,Great MUSIC,"...This band is refreshing and has a different sound, goes with the TOOL tradtion but yet still defins its own path. I bought this a month ago and havent stopped listening to it even for a day. I must listen to this everyday... it is that good!!! Enjoy!!! Highly recommend!!!"
4,Amazing CD....,"This CD is great. It shows the edgier side of the band. The singer's voice is very raw and unrefined, but it works very well. I recently got their new cd ""el cielo"" and it is also a great disk. However, their sound has become more digestable by a wider audience. The singer's voice has matured and you can tell his talent has come leaps and bounds since leitmotif. Both disks are awesome. I highly recommend them. Also check out another band called ""Stigma"" which are also amazing."
5,Spanish for Children (Passport Books),This is a wonderful program that I have successfully used with children from kindergarten through grade three. The kids love the songs and games. It's lively and a lot of fun. Just what learning should be!
2,The Next Morning Never Quite Dawned,"The Next Morning were a Jimi Hendrix adoring band, and boy is it evident in their music. This cd contains only 8 tracks so you've got to figure at least 4 are good right? Not exactly. While I'll admit the title song kicks some serious booty as does ""Changes Of The Mind"", these guys were too hard rocking for their own good. All the remaining songs, while not fair to be called fillers, are sort of pointless. ""Adelane"" left me shaking my head and hoping for that time to come back. The vocals are nice, if too Hendrixy, and the guitar is some roaring stuff. 2 stars for the 2 songs about sums this one up, though it should be noted Sundazed, the company who reissued this, was at peak form on this again."
5,Strong - did the job!,"I only installed these a week ago, but they do the job much better than any product I found at Home Depot or Lowes. My kitchen was remodeled in 2006 and the hinges are breaking where they connect to the door frame. This product has better construction and seems to be stronger. Time will tell."
3,"shiny nsils, but fell apart","The product worked great as promised and really shined up my nails, and I actually did notice that they grew faster in coming weeks. The only problem that I had was that when I pulled it out of its wrapping, the gray side was somehow stuck to it and it ripped partly off."
3,Just O.K.,Not as good as the one the person was trying to sell me at the mall. I did find another one online that worked better than this one.
1,Not what I had hoped for,"I had used one of these buffers at a mall kiosk and was very impressed with it, but did not want to spend $40.00 for the whole package. I was very happy to find just the buffers available online, but these do not work as well as the one I tried. They don't make my nails as shiny, it is a lot of work to get that minimal shine, and it seems to weaken my nails."
1,Was looking for some shine,"I purchased this product because it said it would make my nails shine, like other products I tried at a kiosk at a mall. I didn't do it at all, unless I buffed and buffed until my nail was on fire. If you're not looking for the natural shine look, it's a fine buffer for under nail polish."
1,Not impressed,"i wanted to do an at home french manicure so i bought this. when i went to file my nail, my nail made sliced into the side of it. it did smooth the top of my nail, but i was still upset that i had to use another filer to shape my nails. i previously bought one of another brand that was much better and was dissapointed with this one."
3,Is pure vocalism enough?,"This is a superstar Rigoletto that I can't listen to anymore. Sutherland barely pronounces Italian intelligibly and wanders vaguely across the tempo in every scene. Milnes is hectoring and loud, with no affection or pity for Rigoletto. Bonynge is second-rate at best, very wayward and limp in his leadership. Only Pavarotti is a true glory, impeccable in eveyr way as the Duke. Rigoletto hasn't done all that well on recordings, and you have to pick your way through the various ups and downs of the Giulini, Muti, and Sinopoli versions, to name some of the promient ones. There's always the classic Callas, which will never be surpassed, and a live performance under Giulini with Renata Scotto on Opera D'Oror, but that is in dreadful radio sound. So there will always be a place for this flawed rendition, especially among those who love voices more than Verdi."
1,great music - bad CD,"The CDs appear to have some kind of copy protection which prevents them from playing properly in all CD players. For example, they do not play correctly on my computer but they do play in my home stereo system. I have read that copy protection systems will prevent a CD from playing in computers as well as some types of car stereos and portables. I did not check to find out if it will play in my car stereo and my portable CD player.This is not acceptable to me because I often use my computer for casual listening. I also make a ""car copy"" of any CD that I use in my car stereo and this CD cannot be copied with my computer.Although the music is every bit as good as the others reviewers have said, I have returned this recording, and one other new London recording which had the same problems, because I do not want to be restricted in the equipment that I use for listening."
2,"A quite good interpretation, but not perfect","There is no doubt that this Rigoletto is a very pleasant Opera. Nevertheless, I am surprised to see that everybody put 5 stars to this recording which is described as if it were the perfect interpretation.Indeed, the performance of Callas, Gobbi, Di Stefano and Serafin is really the only one that deserves five stars. The characterisation is so deeper, the voices are such more powerful than they are in Bonynge one, sensitive and beautiful that I think that the reason why all these rewiewers put five stars is only because they have never listened to this perfect Rigoletto of 1955."
1,Not up to the praise.....Sorry,"Well, hate me for it but I don't find this recording perfect. The reasons? 1)Bonygne's sloppy conducting. Compared to people like Serafin or Giulini he is second rate. 2)Joan Sutherland: Way too late for Gilda! Mushy diction and bad phrasing. Full of notes and empty of sense. 3)Sherill Milnes: Once more a sad recording of a once great talent. Bad intonation, scooping and tasteless style. Gimme Gobbi, Cappuccilli etc. any day. The only positive thing is Pavarotti's vivacious Duke. But even he can be forgotten once you listen to Kraus, di Stefano or Alvarez. So...yeah....!!!!!!!!"
4,"Fun for adults, kids too emotional","This game is great. I love that there are no batteries involved. Some of my family members didn't like how the game could change so much with the spin of the wheel. I think that kept it exciting and fun. We played with my 5 year old,who was winning, and the spin of the wheel turned his luck. He was furious and stormed off. We'll give it another try soon."
2,Uno Spin,"Not much fun for two players...... More than two players might be more fun & exciting. Played twice, never used the spin....."
4,A good Uno variation,"My daughter recently got this for her birthday. It's a quick, fun Uno game that even my 5-year-old can handle. My kids especially love to spin the board, and they seem to be learning good gaming strategy. We like it a lot!"
4,James J Hill & Opening of Northwe,"Very readable. I took it along on a recent trip on Amtrak's Empire Builder, while I didn't finish the book on this trip, too much to see, this is a perfect place to read it.I recommend it."
3,"A good book, but possibly reaching too far","This was an odd read for me. I got a lot out of the book, but did not enjoy reading it nor agree with the final approach devised by the author. The author's view of a business application got a bit too framework-y for me and too restrictive. I agreed with many of the book's statements about a business-driven design and using business objects as the core of the code base. If you are looking for more fresh ways to think about how objects behave and/or fit in to your business object development then I think this book can be worth the read."
2,nothing remarkable,"I bought ""Ellpee"" based on the ""Words Enough to Tell You"" single, as featured in the ""Nuggets II"" boxed set.That song was absolutely charming. But nothing on ""Ellpee"" lives up to that lofty standard.The album's pleasant enough -- only one or two clunkers as far as songs go. But it simply isn't earth-shattering or remarkable.Probably the biggest issue was the Mascots were really into the Beatles. They try very, very hard to sound just like John, Paul, George and Ringo, but don't quite have the songwriting ability -- ""Words Enough to Tell You"" being the exception.(And an advisory ... that song isn't on this album.)The best songs on ""Ellpee"" are when they break out of the Beatles mold, and let a little bit of the Mascots seep in. But those moments are very rare.It's not a bad album, but nothing great."
4,Swedish Pop Genius!,"This is one of the best bands to have come out of Sweden and in fact Europe, during the 60s.True, their fantastic ""Words enough to tell you"" is not here and it would have been a better choice than anything between tracks 4-6...had that one been here I would give this 5 stars!I love this record and I prefer it to their debut, there's more variety and even with the aforementioned lows, the highs are as such that I would strongly recommend it!You get brilliant acoustic ballads and great tough Beat tracks like the opener or ""I close your eyes"", with ""I want to live"" perhaps the wildest song they recorded.TRACK LIST ERROR! PLEASE NOTE:Here and in lots of other places on the net track 9 is listed as ""That's you"" when it should read ""I won't let you down"".You will notice ""I don't like you"" twice...take the second off (track 13) for the correct running order!"
5,Beautiful!,I received the plate earlier than expected. My partner is a big fan of trains and I like black & white pictures so this plate was perfect. Great size for hanging on the wall for display.
3,Catchy Euro-Disco,"Let's start of with a track list since there isn't one as of this review:1 - (Just) Me And You (Radio Edit) (3:27)2 - (Just) Me And You (Grant Nelson Radio Edit) (3:34)3 - (Just) Me And You (Joey Negro Club Mix) (7:10)4 - (Just) Me And You (DJ Disco's Superfreak Dub) (4:47)Basically all of these mixes sound very much alike when it comes to the beat and general rhythm structure. The only differences are a few things added, stretched out, and so on. Basically if you are a fan of that techno/disco type music that was so prevalent in the early 90's then this might be right up your alley. Although considering the current rarity and cost for a single of four versions of the same song that don't really sound that different from each other from the outset I would say hold off unless you're a big fan of New Vision."
4,Annexus Quam - 'Osmose' (Spalax),"Originally released in 1970, this was the obscure krautrock band's first of two records. Probably a tad better than it's 1972 follow-up 'Beziehungen' (see my review). Track listing is: ""Osmose I"" (4:15), ""Osmose II"" (3:11), the mind-scrambling ""Osmose III"" (10:36) - possibly the disc's best cut and ""Osmose IV"" (18:20). Couldn't help but to notice Harald Klemm's out-of-this world hypnotic flute work. If you're in the right frame of mind, this CD can send chills up and down your spine. Heard that the Captain Trip label just reissued these two titles on their label as a limited edition of 1,000 copies. Hurry, now before they're gone."
5,an enjoyable read,"i totally enjoyed reading this book! very funny, and relatable! i can't wait to read what's next from the pens of mr. smith!!!"
1,total failure of a product,"This is a simple product. A tank, fluid pump with a lid. After 16 months of infrequent usage the pump stopped working. Why? Because the interior coating of the tank came off and clogged the pump. Since the coating was loose, it became corroded.When I went through Amazon to the mfg. they claimed I had caused the situation by using"
5,Perfect For my needs,This book really help my to quickly and efficiently understand Forms security in ASP.NETI've applied the solution to my app and it works greatSpecial thanks to Dan Kent how help me to solve my particular problemAs usual Wrox is Beautiful ;-)
4,"Crescent C718 Automotive Sliding Wrench, 18-Inch","I have this 18"" Crescent auto wrench and find that it works great for larger nuts and bolts as well as on threaded brass and iron pipe fittings. It has a much bigger capacity than a standard 18"" adjustable wrench and the jaws are smooth so won't chew up or leave teeth marks on nuts and fittings like a traditional pipe wrench can.This wrench is made in China, but has a solid feel to it and tightens down on the fittings securely. The handle is straight along the entire length instead of tapered, which allows for substantial grip and decent leverage.Overall, I'm very happy with this wrench and would definitely recommend it if you frequently work with larger nuts and bolts or pipe fittings."
1,Amazon should honor their mistakes.,"I saw this Ford wrench listed for an exceptionally low price at which I jumped on to purchase. When I checked my e-mail today low and behold my order was cancelled without explanation and I was routed to this product where the price was corrected. Amazon is no Wal-Mart! Anywhere else I have shopped, on-line or in store, the store has always honored their mistakes or at least made an effort to satisfy the customer, but not here!"
4,1st OpenWater Dive to 60 feet,"This past weekend I took the SD600/WP-DC4 for a 60 foot dive and wasable to take pictures and video in 15-foot visibility. The Dive Master said I would not need to ""oil"" the O-ring since it was new. The ""oil"" is to maintain the O-ring's flexibility and only needs enough to moisten it. Time will tell. Also, I would buy a nice retractable strap to attach to your BC to allow you to extend and then secure the camera when not using. It is a good idea to give the camera to someone on board the boat and have them hand it too you before you jump into the water as well. This could be dropped in with a line, etc. There was even a separate bucket with clean fresh water for cameras only. Enjoy, I will probably buy some ""spare"" O-rings to be on the safe side. Too early to give 5 stars. It should be noted that someone else had a ""Sea Life"" digital camera, I think the DC500. Apparently, it ""locked"" up on him and he was not able to get any pics, etc."
3,"Original Japanese gets 5 stars, dub gets 2","I love this anime. It's witty and beautifully drawn, and I watched it when it was simulcast on Crunchyroll. I was so happy to hear that it was going to be available in the US. We bought it, and watched the dubbed version. As with all anime, if you've watched the subtitled version, it takes a while to get used to the new voices in the dubbed version. And things were going well, until we got to my favorite arc, the Color Rangers. In the original, the kids were funny and quick, with great buddy-type repartee. In the dubbed version, they sounded stupid. It was so disappointing. I also found, as the dubbed series wore on, that Prince Baka's hilarious weirdness was considerably diminished in comparison to the original. Whomever worked on the script for the dub took considerable license with the original script. Because I can watch either version with this set, I'm still very pleased to own it."
5,This Venus Needs a Worthier Lover,"I've recently grown very fond of this opera, not least of which has to do with the plot.Ludwig is fabulous, as is the 'Paris' score. I haven't heard Domingo, but so far, no tenor has been successful in the role. Kollo is weak, and strained, as is the baritone, and I can only fantasize about great instruments wrapping around the parts.Why wasn't James King used here? You must have this recording, though. To console yourself, just pretend that one day a great recording will emerge of this opera...that they'll discover a recording made and canned by Carreras, or Corelli(!), or Jussi. Nilsson's as Venus/Elizabeth comes closest, but listening to Windgassen is torture for me....I can't stand his voice."
4,Worthwile,"The CD is worthwile listening to it - Kollo is probably the best Tannhäuser on CD (in my eyes/ears) the most challenging of all Wagner Heldentenor roles (beautiful and convincing Rome tale). Ludwig seducing, Behrens already a little too much away from the lyric side of the young Elisabeth. Solti blends the two worlds too much, you don't really feel the undertone of Tannhäuser's attraction to the Venus world. Great choir... Try the Celibidache version of the overture as a concert piece and you feel the two worlds without one note of singing..."
5,Awsome,"Gurren Lagann is an amazing show that brings back the mecha genre. I am very happy with this product and the rest of the series. There is a number of epic mecha battles that include many stunning visual effects. I thought that the visual style alone made Gurren Lagann stand out from other upcoming mecha shows and those of the past. Gurren Lagann is an amazing show, end of story."
2,Gurren lagann volume 1,"Good anime. But item description should be redone. It does not list the episodes on item, which is misleading as to what product you are buying, as there is a volume 2 for gurren lagann and a volume 2 - 2 disc set for gurren lagann. One has 5 episodes, and one has 10 episodes. Need more specifics given in dvd information."
5,The same but much cheaper,"This is a great recording, especially for Price's performance. A dramatic, sensuous Aida, her 'smoky' voice ideally suited to the role (e.g, O patria mia in Act III). Vickers is a strong, virile, Radames, the fine vocal actor that he is; and Merrill (Amonraso) and Tozzi (Ramfis) are in superb voice, playing their parts with complete conviction. Gorr sings a passionate, heart-felt, Amneris (e.g., L'aboritta rivale in Act IV). The only reservation is Solti's 'steamroller' conducting. A little more attention to detail, and mood, would have made this a legendary Aida on discs.I recommend the cheaper, 2-for-1 Decca CD, roughly half of the cost of this recording. A synopsis of the action is included, with the appropriate cues numbered, but no full libretto."
2,"I agree, it's too Wagnerian","This Callas basher obviously lies. First of all, I do think Leontyne Price has a very odd mannerism with her voice- pinching it to make it sound thick. Second, del Monaco was one of the greatest Radames of the century, his singing of the role superior over to that of Jon Vickers. Vickers is taking the role too technically. Mario, although not a bel canto specialist or a Wagnerian tenor, specialized in Verdi, Puccini, and verismo. Then, the lying Callas basher contradicts himself by saying that the E-flat is not written in the score, so Callas shouldn't sing it. Well what about Joan Sutherland's Lucias and her Sonnambulas and the rest? They shouldn't be proper either! He's obviously uneducated about opera, seeking war with others to create tension between the diva factions.And I agree, this is too Wagnerian. Except for Price, the whole shebang of this Aida is represented by Wagner specialists."
5,"""Ritorna Vincitor""","I can only say, that this recording of Aida, is the best I have ever heard. Solti, is great.After listening this, he became one of my favorite directors. He makes you listen, every inch of the orcherstra, leaving it with a great majestry, that is required in this opera. Price, is considered to be one of the greatests Aida's of the century, and here she shows that. Her ""Ritorna vincitor"", is great. Vickers is fantastic too, he never lets you down in the entire opera, his ""celeste Aida"", is beutifuly sang too. And Gorr, and Merril, diserves, some words too, they makes the perfect Amonastro, and Amneris. Well, if you want to hear Aida, follow my advice, and try this recording, is the best."
5,Still good reading for boys,"I'm over 60 and first read this book in 1954. It is still a good read! The story holds together, the technology is imaginative. Maybe boys today would be better off reading Tom Swift than using those body fattening and mind-numbing electronic devices so prevalent today."
5,Outstanding Chicano Poetry,"I am not sure what was more of an honor and a privilege: meeting El Maestro, José Montoya, or reading his poetry. Nevertheless, I found this book to be full of insightful, down-to-earth poetry from a living encyclopedia of Chicana/o history. But, his words cannot be limited to only one venue, such as ethnic studies. Rather, his poetry transcends racial and economic boundaries. El Maestro has much to teach us...about us."
4,"Nice Charm, Lousy Chain","Just received this as a valentine's day gift. I had been looking at this charm but, as always with online shopping, was concerned about what it would actually look like. It looks very much like the picture, and is a perfect size. It looks high quality. It is hollow, but double-sided (the back side is not just an open hollow hole like on many charms) so if it flips over to the back while wearing, it still looks good. The chain however, is cheap! Flimsy would be the best word, it's very thin and appears easily breakable, but that's what you get for a freebie. I'll have to use another chain, but luckily the ring on the charm is large enough that it will work with other chains, even thicker ones."
4,In a class of their own!,"It has taken them a long time to be heard by the world,but the 21st century belongs to Stratovarius.Their new opus follows closely the previous one'Destiny',being a formidable collection of melodic,speed,power,and progressive-neoclassical metal that leaves in the dust a lot of today's wannabes who skipped their classical composition classes."
3,No hard feelings?,"Born and raised in Europe, greatly exposed to the armada of various styles of Heavy Metal (appreciate most of it). As for this album... If 20% Blind Guardian + 40% Helloween + 40% Malmsteen sounds like a good recipe for your brewery, then this BUD is for you... Individually, I'm a big fan of all of the above (specially the Blind), but not necessarily all poured in one mug. Does not touch the hart nor pumps adrenaline for me! Very mediocre album to my taste. I hope this helps!"
3,A weak recording by Stratovarious,"It is a weak recording by the band that sounds burnt out and trying to put out a product that would satisfy their record company. They took an extended break afterwards.Destiny and Visions are much better representive of the band.P.S. When looking at reviews, I always look for the lowest rated first because these are often the most honest reviews. They are generally fans of the band who don't want a newbie buying the cd, being disappointed, and not buy any other of the bands cds.By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves, thus the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
4,What a Voice!,Timo Kotipelto has a really good soaring epic metal voice that sounds like Geddy Lee at times. Awesome album and the cover art is exceptional!
1,ANOTHER ONE BY THE KINGS OF EMOTIONLESS METAL,"STRATOVARIUS may be hailed as the creators of a new musical genre: the emotionless metal !! Their playing is so clean, so flat, so sleeky, that any merits their records have is surely going to be forgotten in time. THe vocals are annoying, heartless, disguised as ""operatic"" or ""gothic"", but are nothing more than bad vocals. The extreme use of keyboarsd sink the production. Well, you have already seen that I really don't like this album..."
1,AWFUL,THESE GUY'S ARE THE BIGGEST WEENY'S. THEY ARE SO HAPPY SOUNDING.I CAN'T STAND THE SINGER'S VOICE.
4,More of the same Stratovarius,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Stratovarius fan, but like Yngwie Malmsteen, these guys do have a certain amount of repetition in their guitar solos and at the drums. But at the same time, each song has it's own originality. Your best bet is to buy five of their albums and pick the best two."
3,So-so cd,"Overall, the album is ok. I really bought the cd based upon the preview I heard with Johnathon Butler and was hoping that he would be singing on more than one or two songs. The songs sung by Juanita are ok, but overall, the cd is not on heavy rotation in my car."
3,One Night With The King,"I only purchased this cd because I wanted the song "" One Night With The King "" and the price wasn't bad either, it was missing the second cd and the bonus video was aslo missing and it came with two number one cds instead it was a disappointment but when I contacted the seller he apologized for the mistakes that were made and my credit card was refunded, and I only asked for my missing discs but I was very pleased how it handle everything, we all make mistakes. I will definitely do business with him in the near future."
5,Genuine Devotion in Orchestral Gala,"I am thankful for this whole project. My 8 year-old daughter loves it, and ""secretly"" listens to it in her room. I am not exclusively Christian nor is my daughter, we love Spirit, and many types of devotional music. This is my very favorite gospel CD. And, yes, we love Sister Act 2 a lot, too! Falling in Love with Jesus live (we have the Worship Album too) just does it for me. Melts all pretense inside myself and fills me with yearning. The only thing is, there's a part where she goes, ""Not talking about Buddha, not talking about Krishna, but Jesus"" .. well, I am too ecumenical and a believer in Unity of all spiritual traditions to let that go. But, she is just being really really devotional in her own way here. Blessings!"
2,"khachaturian,spartacus",recently bought the above cd found it disappointing the musicwas loud at times and then would fade to nothing . very frustrating.
1,What a piece..... of poop.,"If ""Automatic Centrex Head"" is the proper name for a head that has no ability to automatically dispense trimmer line, then it is aptly named. With the factory-installed spool, the line broke CONSTANTLY, every 30 to 60 sec, and each time the line snagged on itself and coiled up around the shaft, necessitating a disassembly of the head in order to manually extricate the ""automatically dispensed"" line.... which as another reviewer noted, always seemed to be too much.After putting up with this nonsense for longer than I should have, I launched this POS into a brick wall. Several times. Had to salvage some satisfaction from the experience."
1,Junk,"Total junk. I bought it thinking I was getting a great combo edger and trimmer. In retrospect, it turns out you really don't need a combo - just flip the trimmer over and voila you have an edger. I should have returned it and gotten my money back when I noticed that the entire shaft assembly was loose (right out of the box). However, I persevered with it for 2 seasons. This spring the plastic weed guard cracked and fell off. Then it just stopped working - most likely a short in the electrical. I'm going with Huskvarna or Troy-bilt this next time around."
1,Don't waste your money!,"After my second use, this trimmer went to the curb for trash collection.Never could get it to feed line correctly; had to pull line out by hand. Purchased a second head [operator error?], which ended up in a knot of line.The cutting head flops around, and even with duct tape, still could not cut a straight line.Sorry I ever left Craftman."
2,Didn't like it,"Used the trimmer twice and went back to my old tap-n-go line advance. The trimmer head on this model feels loose, making it difficult to judge cutting path when edging, and seems to wobble when in use. The line advance was erratic and unpredictable so if you felt you needed more line you just had to wait, and sometimes got more than you wanted. Always had great success with previous Weed Eater electrics, but didn't like this trimmer at all. Gave it away and reluctant to buy another WE electric trimmer."
1,Shoot the designer and the quality control team,"I fell pray to the ""automatic feed"" idea. It NEVER worked right, breaking the line every 30 seconds, loosing the line inside the head constantly, and if it did feed, it would wrap itself around the feed head and jamb. This is a GRADE ""A"" LOSER."
1,Not an Easy Product to Use,"I have tried and tried to use this tool. The line does NOT self feed, ever. I can't use it for more than a few seconds without having to turn it over and pull out more line, which cuts off in a few more seconds.Also, like some others have said, it ate my extension cord. Smoke billowed, the extension cord is ruined. Not good at all.Save yourself a lot of frustration!"
4,Still running after 8 years,"Bought it in 2002 and have used it every year since then. The little piece of plastic you push the cord through to keep it from coming out broke in about the first year (cheap too-thin plastic). Now I just tie it through the handle to secure it. Recently the line stopped auto-advancing and the ""twist and edge"" mechanism doesn't stay locked in position unless you really fiddle with it (it clicks, but won't always stay in the setting you want). It's also kind of a pain to reload the line. Besides that, it has worked pretty well and the motor still runs strong."
3,I owuld put four other Parsifals ahead of this one,"Parisfal is a religious icon in its native Gremany, and there are performances that catch its essence, as the Solti reading does not. I love the Karajan on DG, the live 1961 Vienna State Opera performance, also under Karajan, on RCA, and at least two Knappertsbusch readings from Bayreuth, where he owned this opera--the 1964 with an incomparable Jon Vickers as Parsifal and the heralded 1951 with Windgasen. Once you've heard a Parsifal that combine passion and reverence, this version, with the crude-soudning, blatant Kollo, an aged Frick as Gurnemanz, and nobody else making much of an impression, feels superfluous, unless you value Solti's unrefined manner."
4,Best Viking Movie Ever!,"This is a movie for those who don't believe that determination and perseverance can produce success in the most adverse circumstances and for cynics that don't believe that ""love conquers all"". It's also a heart-warming movie about the importance of family - and pastry. And I have to say that this film deserves to be on the shortlists of best car chase, best prison break, and best heist scenes in movies. If you like quirky humor, this Danish is for you."
3,Not quite there,"With very few notable exceptions (Godfather series for one) sequels is not my cup of tea and in fact find them risky at best to pursue the better the original was.This goes well with this one as well. I was a devoted fan of the prequel (In China They Eat Dogs) and this mainly since it was original, surprising and refreshing..It is hard to follow up on that and in my mind you should really not but I guess the financial incentive is too hard to ignore.All this being said this movie is not all bad, it is in fact a quite pleasant movie and I rate it a high 2 / low 3 stars... and it would likely get a better reception (by me at least) had it not been linked with the excellent In China They Eat Dogs."
4,Great Dishwashing Brush,"I really like this brush. I like the way it bends with the item you are washing. I have been washing goblets with it, and adjusting it so that it has a soft touch, and I haven't broken one goblet. (If I use a sponge I always break them... It's just me.) The brush is adjustable, so that it will bend as much or as little as you like. I wish it were more durable. (Thus the 4 stars instead of 5.) I have already ordered a back-up/replacement because it is wearing quickly. Perhaps It should not be used on pots and pans. I think it is meant for more delicate items. Still it's great for all dishes and glasses. I'm ordering another - I think that says it all."
5,crispro diswashing brush,This is a great product. It is easy to use and the longer handle lets you clean larger items.
2,not what i was looking for,the spring does not hold its shape; it is probably good for bottom corners but you can't shape the brush to catch the sides of a bottle
3,A good idea that doesn't work that well.,I bought this to help wash my wine decanter. The adjustable screw top head is a good idea. The only issue is that you need press fairly hard to get the screw portion to bend. That makes it difficult to use. If you don't need something that is very flexible this should be good for you.
5,Collision Course,"This was a great concert! Awesome collaboration of styles of music and musicians. If you are a fan of either Jay-z and/or Linkin Park you will love this DVD. However,I wish I hadn't bought the (clean) version."
1,freedom of expression!!!,"disapointed. is a shame, the case of this dvd don't say anything about the clean version, i have to return the dvd because the songs are interrupted for silences, bad bad..."
2,Too small,"The case was/is too small. I can barely fit my bag pipe into it. Each time I take the Bag Pipe out or ""squeeze"" in I worry about damaging the bag pipe.In viewing the image I thought it would be similar to my instructor's but it was not, it is/was considerably smaller."
3,Uneven,"This is a tough hard boiled thriller, until a woman is involved. And then our hero gets stupid. The author needs to make a commitment. A hero who is smart, tough and capable, or a wuss."
5,good book but...,"I liked this book better than MacKinty's other novel but it gets very dark towards the second half. It doesnt really warn you that that's going to happen because the first half isnt like that. If you can stomach tough violent prose you will like this book. If not maybe you should skim certain parts of the second half. Still, a very, very good read."
4,Michael Forsythe...round two,excellent continuation of the MIcheal Forsythe saga. Good grisly action without the over the top heroic antics. The protagonistenjoys a refreshing almost bemused outlook towards his plight and the people who surround him.
5,relative risk,"This fascinating story of life under cover shows how everything can turn into a dangerous test. If almost everyone you meet is a stranger reacting to someone who isn't you, the most innocent comment can turn fatal. Such a situation is almost totally isolating because you never get to be yourself and you don't know how many of the people you deal with may be acting the role of someone they aren't. Forsythe keeps track of who he really is by reminding himself of who he is pretending to be. He is careful not to be trapped by knowing too much history, not to be lured by understanding literary references, not to get it about North American politics. Still, as survival becomes the issue, caution has to stop."
1,It doesn't work at all. Looks nice in the package.,I chose one star cuz I figured no stars might not register in the system at all.It was very disappointing.
1,Seller needs to be clear!,You CANNOT run this on anything newer than windows 95. I have windows 7 and now I am s.o.l. So not cool. Was really wanting to play this.
3,Tracklisting,1. Fa-Fa-Fa (3:51)2. Fa-Fa-Fa (Shakes Remix) (4:18)3. Fa-Fa-Fa (Princess Superstar's New York Dirty Disco Rabbit Pearl Remix) (6:34)4. Fa-Fa-Fa (Fa-Fa-Fast & Furious Discomix by Bjrn Torske) (10:51)
5,A Great Addition to my Wolfie Collection,A little bit different than the 1st Cd. But I love it just the same. Wolfie is a great band that I'm sure will recieve much sucess in the future. Jump on the bandwagon- and buy this cd!
3,¿Good Life?,"This cd is supposed to the good life of FUBU but yet the rhymes are not all that tight or good. Their rhymes arent really about money or representing. Even though the cd is mediocre at best, the song Fatty Girl is tight as hell. I wouldnt recommend buying this cd, but everybody should check out Fatty Girl."
2,It's alright,"Good songs, Goodlife w/ Nate Dogg, Fatty Girl w/ Ludacris. The rest are decent. Though Light, Camera, Action deserves a mention. The rest of pretty average to me. You might like it more if you're more into dirty south rap. (Personally I'm more into east coast and west coast) Average CD."
5,Very Rare,"This STG is very rare and hard to find. They have another version but this one is the best and has ""Sky fell over me"" on it."
5,enjoyable hard scifi,hard scifi with a great story as a framework. another good novel of the xeelee sequence.
4,The c.d. is tight from the start,Soul 4 Reals latest album shows how incredibly talented they are. The music is tight and they show what they really are all about
4,Magic,"Great CD to listen to, brought back lots of memories from her early years. Liked the Grease remix at the end."
3,CD,I wish the CD I got had had more of Olivia's top songs on it. I also wish I could have heard some of the songs before I bought it . But that's not the fault of Amazon . I like to shop from you because I always get my order very fast . Thank you.
5,Great Collection,"always was a big fan of Olivia Newton John and enjoyed her Versatile Musical Offerings and I also had a crush on her as well back in the day. Magic, Hopelessly devoted to you, were my cuts. I enjoyed her middle of the road musical offerings and the country yet Pop hybrid vibe she had works so well for her vocal talents. this is a very good collection for new fans of Olivia Newton John."
5,Magic -- Olivia Newton-John,I love this CD! It has such a wonderful collection of her songs. I am very pleased with my selection.
4,She's the one that I want.,"I almost made the mistake of getting one of her older collections. Thankfully I chose ""Magic"" instead. This 21 track disc has every single song a casual fan could want from her, and then some. Her early mellow-country-pop is here, all the best ""Grease/Xanadu"" songs are included, and later favorites like ""Heart Attack"" and ""Twist Of Fate"" as well. Also tracks I didn't know like ""Don't Stop Believin'"" and ""Make A Move On Me"", I now like too. Truly an underrated artist, and to Olivia I say I love you, ""I Honestly Love You""."
5,OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN (MAGIC),"As I have only received the cd today(14/01/11)and am currently listening to it,the songs that I have heard are really good.I have always liked some of Olivia's music and movies that she has been in."
5,Outstanding,"What a voice and what a woman, so gracious and grateful for her abilities and her ability to help others, to perform for us all. A major mark in out musical history."
3,"Some magic, many styles","When I ordered this CD I had forgotten that Olivia was originally a country singer! I'm not much of a country fan, but a couple of those made it into pop and I like those. It's OK, but some of the songs are also in the Xanadu CD that I also purchased."
4,Track list blunder,"The world has waited a long time for the definitive collection from this Australian gem. Unfortunately it falls short. How can there be a ""best of"" Olivia without the two hits that started it all, the Dylan penned ""If Not for You"" and ""Banks of the Ohio""? Olivia's recording company has missed a golden opportunity, and in doing so, disappointed millions of her fans."
3,Magic: The Very Best of Olivia Newton-John,"It was supposed to be new and sealed. The case was completely cracked and also in 2 pieces. Amazingly the cd was in great shape! The case being broke in 2 pieces could not have taken place in shipment, cause the front part and back part wasn't even conected it was all broken."
4,Almost Perfect,"Every song I remember growing up on is here!!!! In between there are some other songs I have never heard of before. Summer Nights, Hopelessly Devoted, Xanadu, Magic, Make a Move On Me, Twist of Fate, and most of all, Physical. Everyone is a classic to me!!! However, my one and only problem is that Xanadu sounds like it skips throughout Olivia's music and sound only gets better with age. The number one problem I ever had with her career is : what the devil was done with Grease 2? I've never seen it and have never had the desire to do so. My number two qualm is what was the mess that was ""Two of a Kind?"" If it hadn't been for some of her great songs, it would have ruined the careers of both she and John Travolta."
4,Better but STILL missing key tracks,"Those of us who noticed that ""Back To Basics: The Essential Collection"" was missing a bunch o'hits will find most of the holes filled with this new collection with the stylin' cover art. But not all the holes. Still missing, and for no apparent reason, is ON-J's first hit, ""If Not For You"" (spite? Dylan haters?). It may be easier to live without later hits ""Soul Kiss,"" ""I Can't Help It"" (with Andy Gibb), ""Livin' In Desperate Times,"" ""Tied Up,"" ""The Rumour,"" and ""I Need Love,"" but one of these years there will be a two- or three-disc set that collects all these in one place.Bottom line: If you don't own ""Back To Basics,"" go for this one instead. It retains the older set's 13 hits plus 7 more (and the ""Grease MegaMix""), while dropping the 4 increasingly-less-""new"" songs Geffen lured us with in 1992."
3,Still didn't get it right,"Where are the early country songs? ""If Not For You"" is missing, as are some of her other great early songs. I recommend searching for an out of print copy of her first ""Greatest Hits"" album, buying a used copy of ""Back to Basics"" for her later songs, and skip this latest attempt to remarket her ""pop"" hits.I'm still giving it 3 stars, because it IS good music. It just could have been so much better."
3,"Great song selection, but subpar sound quality!","This is the most definitive of any Olivia Newton-John greatest hits cds issued in the U.S. & Canada.Only two songs are missing, If Not For You & Soul Kiss, her first & last major hits. My biggest problem is the sound quality. It's inferior to her Australian releases which were remastered & infinately improved sound quality. What makes it more disappointing is that it's a full priced cd. For those who want the best sound quality, the Australian Back To The Basics is the most comparable collection, nearly as complete but with much better sound quality, it's well worth the extra cost!"
4,Another incomplete Olivia hits package,"It's hard to believe Universal delivers another incomplete domestic hits package after so many others have been released (both on vinyl and CD formats) in the past. This set includes 21 cuts from the 70s and 80s when Olivia was at her peak on the music charts. Missing is Olivia's first hit on the American pop charts (her version of Bob Dylan's ""If Not For You"") plus several other top 40 hits that were included in previous compilations like ""Soul Kiss"" and ""Tied Up."" The record company could have easily dropped the Grease Megamix and given us a more complete package, maybe even a two disc set. Olivia deserves better! If you already have ""Back to Basics"" and ""Olivia's Greatest Hits Vol. 2"" then don't waste your money."
5,Great Collection!,"This collection is excellent for both the casual and hardcore fans for many reasons. This is by far the best single disc hits album, a lot better than her previous (1971-1992: the Essential Collection)! When I first bought that hits album, I was VERY disappointed. There were still TOO many ""Essential"" songs missing: ""Let Me Be There"", ""Xanadu"", ""Make a Move On Me"", and ""Heart Attack"", all top 10 pop hits. Thankfully, this collection includes these essential songs and even the very enjoyable ""Grease Megamix""! The packaging is superb: colorful pictures and entertaining liner notes!Maybe the next step would be a box set containing 5 or 6 CDs from day one (""If Not For You"" from 1971, for starters)! She deserves box set treatment! I hope everyone agrees!"
3,This needed less Grease music!,I wish it had more of her other music rather than so much Grease revival.
3,so-so,"Like most ska compilations, this is one is pretty spotty. There are some high points with the Bosstones, DHC, the Buck-o-nines, but there are some real stinkers like the Graduates and the Blue Meanies. Ska is about horns and melody and song-writing. For the myriad of ska bands out there it can't be too hard to find 12 truly good songs, but maybe there isn't much to chose from. I suppose most of the ska bands are full of yahoos and pretenders. You can buy this for the 5 good songs on it, but I'd wait till I see it in the used bins."
4,Tackle Box,"I was actually hoping it to be a little smaller than it is,but it does the job.I was sick and tired of lugging around a larger tackle box all the time.Especially when I didnt use everything in it.I bought the smaller box to carry the bare essentials and it worked out fine.Nice Box.Recommended."
3,Ok for the price,"This is, essentially, a cheap, plastic tackle box. I wasn't thrilled with it when I received it. It feels pretty flimsy, as if the handle or guide rails could pop off with the slightest stress. But, for limited use, or for a young kid, this is probably just fine."
3,simple box,"My sons use this for their bey blades. It's simple and a good size for all the different pieces. The top tray isn't the strongest, but it's okay for what they're using it for."
5,more than one,I have a few of these. They make great little craft boxes. One of the boxes I've had for years to act as a small on the go tackle box.
2,Disappointed.,"It is very fragile, is for light use. With little pressure deforms. is made &#8203;&#8203;in USA but with poor quality. I have other Plano boxes and are much more robust, this is the exception."
4,Good for the price,This product is exactly what they say it is. It is perfect for a young or first time fisher. It is light weight and easy to carry. I have really enjoyed this box so far.
3,Plano single tray tackle box,This is a nice product. If you have lots of sinkers or hooks it includes spacers so you can divide them up on the upper tray. My family really likes this product.
2,"There are lots of good ""Trovatores."" This isn't one of them","This is a woefully misguided and magnificently miscast production of ""Il trovatore."" Only someone suffering from the lunatic delusion that Verdi's ""Il trovatore"" is a bel canto opera could love it.""Trovatore"" has its faults but even its faults have a shaggy grandeur to them. This performance has been willfully distorted to accommodate the talents of Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne, neither of whom is a singer in any way suited to this blood and guts opera. Pavarotti is only slightly better in the power-driven role of Manrico. The old warhorse does not deserve to be beaten in this manner. Even the Bocelli version--and you cannot imagine how it pains me to say this!--is more true to the intentions of the composer than this set.One star for a performance that is miscast, misconceived, and misconducted--plus a star for the sheer, bitter laughter it engenders."
3,Colder - Again,"Colder stays true to their band name on AGAIN, their debut for the consistently underrated Output label. A combination of chilly 80s synth-pop with some surprising elements (like dub on ""One Night in Tokyo""), AGAIN shows us that ten years just aren't enough for a good decade. Luckily, Colder draws from some of the better influences: ""Crazy Love"" has the sadness that permeates some of New Order's early tracks. But the predominant mood is one of disaffection; a ""we're too cool to have emotions"" feel. ""Shiny Star"" is slightly peppier, but still retains that glossy sheen; ""Version"" is a sound collage that helps break the mold of what's come before. ""Silicone Sexy"" has an atavistic groove to it that loses a bit of the rawness when the non-sexy vocals come in. But the closing tracks, ""This River"" and ""Colder"" manage to inject a bit more feeling into their veins. While Colder certainly has the chill part down, maybe next time, they can warm up a little."
2,DO NOT PURCHASE!,"I brought this for my 19 month old daughter since she loves to stack stuff. Shipping was great, same day delivery free shipping; and that's the best part about this product. When I opened the box... nice on the out side HOWEVER the blocks were horribly painted, some if not majority were chipped; meaning the paint was chipping. There was a profound smell after opening the box, kind of like fresh paint mixed with wood.All-in-All I would not recommend this brand to anyone."
1,Paint already chipped off,"These blocks arrived looking like they had been slightly used. I thought, okay, no big deal, but then the paint begain chipping off more.Cheap blocks. It's what I get for the price payed."
3,Not what I was expecting,"These blocks are big and that was why I bought them. However, I didnt look at the picture carefully - had I done that I would have seen that these blocks have capital letters on all six sides. I was looking for blocks with capitals, small letters, numbers and maybe pictures on the sides. That being said, my daughter and I have a lot of fun stacking the blocks and knocking them down. They do have slightly sharp edges (I guess like all wooden blocks)and so if you step on them or if you have a child who is learning to walk and falls on them, that would really hurt!"
3,How to behave to make best use of professional services,"The book provides a good amount of advice on how to behave when you need to use the services of a professional, such as a doctor, a laywer, a realtor, a constructions contractor, etc.If you are not living in the US, some of the information may not be applicable; that's why I've removed one star.Note that the title is misleading. This is not a book on improving your communications language, as it may imply. That's why I've removed one more star.Other than that, it may help many people understand some crucial details about the services they want to use and tips on getting the most of the professionals involved."
5,Funny and Smart,"I thought I pretty much knew what I needed about negotiating life, but this book offers some of the most commonsense, down-to-earth tips I have ever come across -- the kind of info you might seek from someone's uncle or friend of a friend, but here it is. And the kind of info that can apply to you as well as your parents and your kids. Plus, it made me laugh. Great book for college grads."
5,Pavarotti's self esteem is exceeded by his performance !,"To fully appreciate LP's contribution to music, one must be exposed to a wide range of his performances, i.e. stage,concert,duets, popular, etc. and devour them with a hunger for his various interpretations. This recording demonstrates his ability to finess the music of love and tenderness ."
4,Catharsis - 'Volume III - 32 Mars' (Spalax),"French band's 1973 four song EP that was released two records prior to their 'Le Bolero' (see my review) title. More in the psychedelic vein, as I got even more out of this import CD as I soaked my senses heavily into ""32 Mars"" (11:08), the well played ""Masq"" (4:16), ""Les Chevrons"" (4:59) and the short version of ""32 Mars"" (3:07). Some rather nice organ playing here as well as good musicianship are clearly intact. Only problem is this EP runs a mere twenty-three minutes. Should be double that. Plus, it looks like mostly a different line-up."
4,Not what you might expect.,"This a somewhat handy compact reference book, but the title is a tad misleading. The term ""artillery"" as used in this volume can, and does, mean anything from an intercontinental ballistic missile down to a rifle mounted grenade launcher. There is of course the full spectrum of towed and self-propelled artillery pieces, but many of the entries would more typically be found in works focused on guided missiles or infantry weapons. Even so, the weapons covered are discussed in sufficient depth to make this guide useful and interesting to the casual reader. Because of the varying classes of artillery, this book is not all inclusive and how the author determined what to include or not include is not clear. Still, I would recommend purchasing this item if you can find a copy at or below the cover price of $12.95."
5,A Dream Come True,"Growing up, there was 2 comedys I watched ALL THE TIME. One, was Spaceballs. The other, was Robin Hood: Men In Tights. When I recently signed up for Amazon, I was browsing around. I was a bit exhausted at the time, and then I came across this DVD. I thought I may have been dreaming. I couldn't believe my eyes. Two of my ALL TIME FAVORITE comedys on one DVD? No way. But sure enough, it's true!! This is instantly one of my favorite DVDs. Simply one of the best DVD purchases I have ever made. Two of the funniest comedys ever made, one one DVD. It's a dream come true!! BUY THIS DVD!! NOW!"
3,Robin Hood-Men in Tights/Spaceballs,"Men in Tights is more enjoyable than Spaceballs. I have other Mel Brooks movies: Blazing Saddles, History of the World part 1 which are on the same level as Men in Tights. My grandson & I were looking for History of the World part 2 & found Spaceballs in parenthesis to the side of History part 2 title. It wasn't done in the same format/comedy style as part 1 was but we did get through it."
4,Two for the Price of Humor!!!!!,"Wow, i remember when I saw these two movies together as a set. I thought, ""Dude I want it!!!!"" I bought it, because Spaceballs will always be a classic comedy!! (I'm a mawg, half man half dog, i'm my own best friend) RIP Candy! (Comb the desert) First of all, Mel Brooks comedy is to be watched with a sense of dry and cheesy humor. Its not the best witty remarks, but the jokes are funny . . . . We've been jammed? lol Raspberry? whatever it was! Too funny.. . . Men in tights? We're Butch! David Chappelle, I never would of thought he would become this famous but was so funny in that movie. . . When he was jumping over the creek back and forth :) (Hope someone has a video camera!!) when getting beaten!!! Both Movies are awesome and great to watch all over again!!"
1,Not exactly what I was looking for.,"First I tried it it didn't work, it said it required a Xbox hard drive. After I purchased the hard drive and put it in, I found out it only works with hand controller, it does not work with Kinect. Therefore this was of no use to me."
1,Pretty bad,"After watching and enjoying Alex De Iglesia's ""Crimen Ferpecto,"" I decided to check out some of his other films. This one was probably the worst of the bunch. ""Common Wealth"" is a fairly repetitive comedy about greed and duplicity that lacks the director's usual visual gusto. In the end he cranks it up for a finale that's heavy on stunts and physical comedy, but seems out of place with the rest of the film's tone."
3,I have learned something...,"I have learned to check the SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS very carefully when purchasing any software at all!! This software is for Windows 95/98 and evidently is so old that The Princeton Review website no longer exists. Broderbund Co. (The Learning Company) provides very limited support for this product. The phone numbers for both technical and customer support were no good. I was finally able to get the one CD - Grade Builder - to load and run (Windows XP) and my daughter did stay on and play the games. Yes, her text book is listed - just not the same year publication! It is incomplete. Since that is how I sold her on the CD's (it matches up with your textbook) I was foiled from the start!"
1,Sorry Folks but this didn't work for me!,"This program was not all it was hyped up to be. The lessons were too complicated. If I knew what they expected me to know I would not have purchased the software. The animated characters were very racial. In the classroom setting the ""dumb"" kid was always black. Thats pretty bad. The white kids were always portrayed as smarter and wealthier. Black kids were portrayed as dumb and poor. Dont buy this software if you don't condone racism!"
4,Very Interesting,"I bought this book out of curiosity because after reading the editorial review, I thought I'd give it a try. A couple days later it arrived. I started skimming through it, and decided I had enough time to read at least three of the short stories in the book. I read ""Rebel"", ""Frau Appel"", and ""Speaking of Money"". I'm glad I chose these three in the beginning because they turned out to be my favorites in this overall good book. I gladly reccomend it to anyone."
1,Cant Be Called Afghan Music.,"Ehsan Aman is a so called 'Afghan Singer' but the poor guy has forgotten his own language and culture.This Album contains all Persian( Irani ) songs sang in Indian classic style.And the CD is not even listed with Amazon's Afghan Section.Its a very poor CD, also becoz of the fact that is doesn't have anny Afghan song in it."
1,This Is Not Afghan Music!,"Hello Every one,I just heard this CD on Mastana Entertainment, And its not Afghan CD, its All Farsi songs!Ehsan Aman is a great singer, but He shouldn't forget his roots and his language, called Afghan (Pashto).I dont see anny good things in this CD, i think its all commercial thing, he tries to Sell his music to Irani Costumers, not to Afghan.So Dear Ehsan Aman, Dont forget the original language of your country!"
1,Ehsan Aman,"its like the worst Afghan music i ever heard!If you guys want Afghan music, then listen to Nashenas, he is Afghanistan's best mussician. This is all Copy."
3,Sutherland's vioce isn't quite there...,"When one thinks of Dame Joan Sutherland, they think perfect coloratura, with the tone of ringing bells in the upper register. This is not the case for Sutherland this late in her career. Her vioce is older and in the lower registers richer and in some ways more expressive, but the character of Amina should be done by a lighter and younger sounding vioce. In the later years Sutherlands was more suited for older roles such as Anna Bolena. I think in that case her aged vioce may have helped the charater rather than hindering it. This recording, however, is a wonderful one by Pavarotti who is in much better vioce. Like the other reviewers I would chose Sutherlands earlier recording over this one, or maybe the one done by June Anderson, who's young vioce is much better suited to the part."
4,"good, not great","This is a good recording, but Sutherland's early 1962 recording is the best one in the catalog. But take a look at this, everyone, look at Mr. Robert Setetsky profile. He chose to bash the recordings of Sutherland AND Tebaldi, who were, as everyone knows, Callas's biggest rivals. So I guess, by bashing Callas's rivals, and briefly mentioning the greatness of Callas, Mr. Setetsky's is indirectly saying that Callas was in a class of her own, and better than Sutherland and Tebaldi? I dare say that all three were in a class of their own. Each diva had her own unique style. Callas, the queen of verisimo. Tebaldi, the queen of song. Sutherland, the queen of bel canto. No one is greater than the other. The were all equally great. We only wish we had another soprano in their class today."
1,POOR OLD SUTHERLAND......,"No I am sorry, I just cannot recomend this recording at all. I love Dame Sutherland, she had one of most beautiful coloratura sopranos of our time. She has made wonderful recordings of Bellini and Donizetti operas.... this is NOT one of them. She sounds so old and it is almost painful to hear her pinch out these high ackward notes. Please don't waste your money on this one."
4,still beautiful,"pavarotti is great in this recording, sutherland's voice is already a little wasted, but it makes a beautiful performance, but nothing comparable with her first version in the early 60's .that is an amazing amina performance. the opera is beautiful, is my favorite by bellini & i can hear over & over & never get tired"
2,I wonder at the Sutherland-FAns...,"Us Callas-Fans get torn to pieces when we defend late Callas-stuff but it's different for Sutherland who couldn't sing a Norma that sounded different from Amina? I'm sorry, but as MUCH as I ADORE Joanie, this is just BAD. Take Callas' live-recording with Valletti or an earlier recording with Joanie and you'll be fine! :-)"
2,The worst of all,I live in Iran and I must say that at least LP had a great number of fans here but after the LPJZ mash ups they have changed to half.We all hope that LP will return to its original music...
5,Pronto! Review,"Pronto! Writings from Rome is a collection of short stories that make you feel as if you are there ... you can share the romance of the characters, setting, storyline. My favorite is ""Steps"". It is about a women we can all identify with... too much in a hurry to stop and smell the roses. The lesson she learns from strangers in a far away place speak quietly to her heart, calling out the person she truly is. Each piece is unique to itself; an enjoyable read!"
1,Check your facts!!,"I was ecstatic when I saw a book based solely on Steve Yzerman was finally being published. I was completely misguided. This book wasn't about Steve Yzerman the person/hockey all-star, this book was about all the things that happened around Yzerman over the last 3 decades. I was also horrified that the author never even interviewed Yzerman. Makes me think I should write a book. I know Gerard Gallant would talk to me and I know that I would remember that he coached the Summerside Hemphill Pontiac Western Capitals who won the Royal Bank Cup in 1997. Which leads me to the comment that not only was this book a huge disappointment because it gave us nothing about the real Yzerman, but it was replete with errors. Essentially it is wrong to have this book in the non-fiction section of the bookstore because most of the information is so inaccurate that the novel is fictional. Don't waste your money."
3,Great Anime! Excellent box and extras! Faulty DVDs!,This is a wonderful and amazing anime. Lots of excitement and drama and characters that live in all kinds of shades of grey. I truly enjoy this anime. The box set is excellently done with a very pretty box and loads of wonderful extras. I especially appreciated the manga.So why the 3 star review? well this first pressing of discs appears to be defective. Bandai is experimenting with new copy protection and it causes serious problems for many DVD players. In particular seizures at episode 3 in disc 1 and episode 9 in disc2. That is provided that it works at all. People using blu-ray and in particular PS3 players appear to have much better success rates though.
1,I cannot recommend this book!,"The sample questions are true/false and the answers are too obvious. The CPA exam is more challenging than that. The outlines don't hit the fine points that make a difference to candidates' understanding of the material. The complete study guides are excellent. If you don't have much time, the complete guides are broken down into specific topics to facilitate focusing on limited areas for persons with limited time."
3,"Great game, when it works.",This game is great for teaching little ones basic mouse skills. The only problem is it kept freezing up. I ran this game on Windows XP machines and I even tried changing the compatibility mode to Windows 98 and it still kept freezing up.
2,Only got 1 CD-ROM,"I ordered this product Dec.10th, 2012 and only received 1 CD-ROM. I am not happy; it was a christmas present for my son :-("
5,I havent read it yet....but...,"It is a nice book and a nice size for travel, which I wanted. With the long flight, I plan to read it on the plane. I did look at a few things within and it does appear it will be a nice read. If you want something to take with you as you travel to the area, I would recommend this."
1,Off tune and off base,"We love the show, but the ""singing"" is off tune with a lot of rap, which would be okay if what little singing there was made sense without visuals. I took this one out of the car and told my 4 year old I lost it (I didn't want to hear it again!) and he didn't mind at all!"
5,Anatomy & Physiology Coloring Workbook,This is an excellent book for any student in the medical health field. It greatly expands and enhances fundamentals.
4,Flap wheels,"Good product, just make sure you get the required quick change adapter to use this product."
1,Locks Up,"Looks nice but feels ""Cheap"". I had to send back for refund because the unit would constantly lock up and require a reset (reboot). I would not recommend until they have fixed the problem. Also, I was not impressed with the setup software. Going back to an IPOD!"
5,VERY nice little unit,I can't find a single thing to complain about. This little thing has EXCELLENT battery life (WAY more than an IPOD). This is an EXCELLENT buy.
2,Returned,"I had mine less than 2 weeks, and I did really like it...then the joystick knob fell off and went inside the player and it wouldnt even turn on...I am in hopes that it was just a bum player, and have asked for a replacement. I bought the accesories for this model...and didnt want to start over ...will try the same brand and pray it isnt all of this make/model that is junk."
2,Good. While it works.,"I bought my Zen V Plus about six months ago and have enjoyed it very much until it quit. It went from working fine to not working without any dropping or other abuse. The display froze up and multiple resettings would not help. I could be just picky, but my prior mp3 player lasted two years and probably still works except I bought this better(?) one. I now have a Toshiba Gigabeat. If it turns to trash, I will listen to the radio."
2,Not what I expected...,"I own the 2gb white-green...it looks really nice and it feels good in your palm...but there are just so many things wrong about it!1.it doesn't come with a wall charger and the original one is 20-30$...I've tried other wall chargers but they don't work2.you can't transfer music without installing the software which takes ages to install and it's hard to use...without installing it the computer simply won't recognize it, not even as a flash drive3.it's pretty much scratch resistant but you if do scratch it even a little bit you won't be able to see anything under the scratch or around that area on the screen4.battery life is 8-9 hours5.if you connect it to your car system or your desktop speakers the sound is very poor...I've tried other mp3 players and they had great sound and great volumeI wouldn't buy it again."
1,3 bought and 3 broken in 1 month,I bought 3 Zen v plus and the 3 brake after 1 month. They send me 3 refubished zen.
1,don't do it...,"Well, it lasted for two weeks until the screen turned sideways, and all of the options froze. We tried to follow the directions to reset the player...didn't change anything. Our daughter was not happy."
1,Will never buy a Creative MP3 ZEN again,"As I emailed Creative, the product should work out of the box. The one I got had a battery that could not be charged. The other thing I noted was that it came with a large amount of memory resident proprietary software. This means that you can only synch the Zen on a machine that has the creative software installed. I sent the whole thing back and feel fortunate that Amazon issued a full refund."
4,Possibly the Best MP3 Value,"I could not be more pleased with this purchase. It is packed with features, easy to use, has a terrific sound and a great feel in the hand. The only negative, that prevented a 5 Star Rating, is the random play. I had read on a previous review that the randomization was below par. Well, it certainly is. It is disappointing but I am so pleased with everything about this unit that it is easily overlooked. I purchased mine at $119 for the 2GB. This compares with $149 for the 2GB I-pod and most other name brand 2GB units. This is a great value."
2,Great...WHEN IT ACTUALLY WORKS...TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!,"Purchased this on March 27, 2007. Stopped working in July, 2007. The little reset button on the side was unresponsive. Plugging it into the computer didn't do anything either. With all troubleshooting options exhausted, called customer support. Turns out there's only a 90 day full warranty. If I wanted someone to help me it would cost $12.95 for the call. I could send it in and if they can fix it, they'll charge an additional $25.00 for the labor. Why would I want the same defective one patched up and sent back to me just for it to break on me again?I also have a SanDisk Sansa m250. It also stopped working, but at least with them, the tech call was free and they sent me a brand new one...no hassel AT NO EXTRA CHARGE!!!Stay away from CREATIVE ZEN...they are a company full of EXTRA CHARGES."
3,Little MP3 player that could,"This is not a high end player, but it's survived the treadmill at the gym. The display is clear enough, although the buttons are not intuitive. You'll hit the wrong buttons until you get imprinted with the Creative Zen way. There isn't a lot of volume, and am I the only one who hates ALL MP3 ear phones? The Zen software interface is functional, and it loads songs easily enough. However, electronic copyright protections are still in the primordial ooze stages. There is slime is all over the uploading process, even for legally-owned music. If you're expecting high end, go elsewhere. If you want a functionally rugged MP3 player that no one will steal, then choose Creative Zen plus."
4,"Good for music, bad for video","Pros====1. Small and practical2. Good shape and presentation, software interface also nice3. Battery lasts for reasonable time (10hrs +/-)4. Display doesn't get scratched5. What you pay is what you get...its really worth for its price6. It was tested by the hearing organization...so you can adjust volume to 18/25 and its scientifically safe to not damage your hearing...Cons====1. Bad video compression (files get larger than original when transferring, like ten times bigger than a common mpg file)2. Creative media source doesn't sync mp3/wma tag changes (you have to actually delete the file from the mp3 player)3. Voice recording wont be understandable if you want to record a class or something (you have to be very close to the person who talks)4. When recording with line-in theres a back noise in the resulting recording... (I'm not really sure about this)"
2,"Good unit, but has a design flaw","I have one of these as well as a 1 GB unit. They both perform well, as expected - I use them to make Old Time Radio programs more portable.However, both units showed the same problem. After a few months of service, the plastic cover that goes over the 5-way navigation button splits in half. The pieces may fall out, or stay inside jamming the nav button. It lasts long enough to outlast the 90-day free service, so it then costs $25 to send it back for repair (they actually send you a new one).Based on this, I wouldn't buy another one. They have just released a 16GB unit at about $250 but the design is the same - so BEWARE, the nav button wil break in about 4 months or so."
4,Great player but useless for people with large hands,"Creative makes great MP3 players, but I din't like this player much. In the current market one can find better options within the same price range.Pros: -1. Small size(also a disadvantage too)2. Feature rich(FM, Video, EQ, themes etc).3. Can change the screen orientation(Rare in new players too)4. Bright screen5. Available in many trendy color combinationsCons: -1. Ultra small size joy stick. Don't buy this player if you have large fingers. Its a pain to navigate through small stick.2. Feels plastic and looks plastic too.3. Sound quality is just above average, but could have been much better.4. Poor battery, I got just 8 hour palyback time. My previous Sansa use to give 16 hours for single charge."
4,excellent service at reasonable price,"I find the product to be excellent, and easy to use. Mine arived with no user guide, so I had to e mail the company for instructions. A simple users guide would be a useful addition."
4,Good player,"I've had a Zen V plus for about six months, and I'm ordering a second as gift for my wife. The sound quality is very good. Battery life is decent. I've had no problems with it whatsoever."
3,Creative Zen V Plus 2 GB MP3 player,"This works great when it works. It freezes alot, shuts down and doesn't always work very well and I have only had it for less than 2 months."
3,The player is not recognized by your computer if you don't install the creative software,"The best thing about the Zen plus is how compact it is. You ll forget it's in your pocket. The interface is very user-friendly; the quality of the sounds is really good.The creative software is very easy to use, but you'll have to install the creative software if you want the Zen Plus to be recognized by your computer in order to transfer any data. So it's all right if you are always transferring music from the same computer, but otherwise you'll have to carry the installation CD around with you. I wanted to be able to take and give music easily when visiting friends and this is not possible unless they perform a full installation on their computer."
5,long time ago,"bought this a long time ago, but love it and ended up buying a second one. I have a newer version but this is a fine product"
2,Bottom line: Buy the Sony Walkman.,After initial set up this thing just did not cut the mustard. I sent it back and got myself the Sony Walkman and have been satisfied with it. So for whatever my opinion is worth I would not buy this player. For my money the Walkman is a better buy.
3,"Awesome, But....","This Creative Zen V Plus really is exceptional: it has a great design, it's really easy to use, and it's a great investment!However, as to be expected, this player has its flaws. I have owned two--the joystick of the first's broke, but fortunately it was within warranty and I was able to obtain another. I enjoyed the second one for about 8 months until a fairly common design flaw kicked in and the screen faded away. Now the display is completely black, and I'm navigating it blindly.I won't give the player a bad review because it truly was awesome while it lasted, but I'm really disappointed with regards to its durability."
3,Functional for reason I bought,"I read the reviews on several different MP3 players before buying this one. I bought it to listen to Netlibrary books because of the ability to bookmark. As other reviewers have mentioned it does have problems locking up although I have noticed it mostly occurs when fast forwarding or rewinding for a long time. The headphones that come with it are not as good as I would have liked as they have foam covers which seem to fall off rather easily. The manual also doesn't explain very well how to access additional menus which can be accessed by holding down the back arrow key which brings up an additional function menu depending on the screen. The battery life is OK, the buttons are small and I have inadverently recorded things when tring to adjust the volume, but overall the functionality is fine for the reasons I purchased it."
4,Daughters very pleased,This and the black Zen V Plus were bought for my two daughters for Christmas. Both were VERY happy to get the players for their present. Thank you for assisting me in making them both truely happy.
1,"Bad ""good"" product","I bought this for my daughter at Christmas- it was so popular I ordered it from 4 different places and they all were out of stock before I finally got one. It didn't work right from the time we took it out of the box. As soon as we installed the software and plug in the MP# player, the computer wouldn't recognize it. It would freeze up and then the next day after charging, it wouldn't power on at all.I read a LOT of reviews before purchasing it and was very excited about the product, but when it came time to replace it and stayed away from the Creative Zen. I just don't have time for trouble. If I had all the time in the world I would purchase another one."
1,Buyer Beware - Display issues (check creative website),"I have owned my creative Zen V for less than four months and the display stopped working. When I checked out Creative's website, there were a slough of customer comments indicating that they had the same problem and decided to either throw the player away or wait months for repair. Two additional problems: Creative Zen V's only carry a 3 month warranty on labor. The 12 month is for the parts only and does not cover the labor involved in repairing/replacing/shipping the item. Creative customer support does not exist (for the most part). You are able to use telephone support for a very short while without cost. After that, the only means of communicating with Creative is via e-mail. Moreover, if you lose the original book that came with the player, you can no longer access the customer service telephone number (check their website and try to find a number to call). Buyers beware."
3,not bad but....,"Easy to load software - fairly simple drag and load concept. Device kept freezing and from other reviews I knew to use the reset. Happened all the time though! Creative online help was amazing - quick to answer and resolve my ongoing technical issues. I'm a bit disappointed that the ""manual"" was only available to read via disk, I'm not a teen and like to read at my leisure .. I'm also not terribly computer literate and my 2g is full with 319 songs (not the 1000 songs advertised)... I'm told by the trusty Creative online help that if I convert my files to something that I'll have more memory... this might be too much for me to handle!"
2,constant break down,"This product may look good but I've experienced problems with freezing, windows could not read the driver, I felt lik I was on a merry go round sending this product back to amazon for replacements."
2,I would not recomend this text..,"I would not recomend this text. It's like the author took a Graph Theory textbook and ran it under a ten ton steamroller. It's like a dictionary of graph theory, not an introductory textbook."
2,hmm..,His explanation makes simple concept complicated. Even Google does a better job to be quite honestly. Not recommended as a introductory textbook.
1,My worst online purchase experience..Ughhh,the book was not what he described. the book was not original and I had lots of problems to return the book
1,What the???,"This book is horrible for learning Graph Theory. It is hard to understand and follow. I don't recommend it at all, especially as a new student. It might be useful as a reference after you learn everything, but it's layout is crammed, crunched and unreadable. I can't understand the simple topics, I had to do internet research to decipher the text."
1,Bad Book,"This is one of the worst books that I have read. Either I dont understand this subject or there is something drstically wrong with this book.I used ""Google"" to find topics in Graph theory and could understand the topics but could'nt understand what this guy wrote."
5,Really fantastic!!,"The man himself - Georg Solti was of the view that Birgit Nilsson achieved her peak - dramatically, vocally and musically - in Elektra. It really is true!!Very highly recommended."
5,Shattering. Blood-curdling. Terrifying. You get the idea.,"""Elektra"" is a nasty piece of work - agonized roiling in a dark pit of primal emotion, puncutated by shrieking eruptions of rage. And Solti - never the subtlest of maestros - milks the score for all its worth. You may feel the need for a shower by the time it's over.But it's Nilsson who elevates this recording into immortality. In ""Ring Resounding"", John Culshaw - who recorded her Brunnhilde for Solti's landmark Wagner cycle - states that not even Flagstad in her prime could match her vocal power. A bold statement! But no one who listens to this opera will be inclined to doubt it. And her vocal acting here is marvelous as well."
2,Not what I thought but ok,For some reason I thought this was a popcorn product. It is ok but not fantastic... the taste is mediocre. Not much bang for the buck.
2,Pirate Booty - Not GMO-free!,"In order to be truly a ""natural"" product, Pirate's Booty should be created GMO-free. There is considerable doubt about the safety of Monsanto's GMO corn [...] and demand a GMO-free product!"
5,just the right size,I love popcorn but always consume too much when i make up a batch. Now I get my popcorn fix and don't go overboard (not a pun on words....)
3,Great Product--Watch the date,"We love Pirate's Booty products. The product arrived within the estimated time frame, however it was ""short-dated."" I received 59 bags of Aged White Cheddar corn puffs and ALL expire in 4 months!!! Really???"
1,Not What Is Pictured,The Pirates Booty I received for my wedding gift bags was not what was pictured. It had Sponge Bob on the front and the back talks about a Nickelodean Hotel making it seem like this was specially packaged for a hotel and leftover so they're selling it. It would look stupid in a wedding gift bag - and I question its origin. Very disappointed and am sending back.
5,AWESOME PRODUCT,"Pirates Booty is sooo good and me and my kids LOVE them. Much healthier and better tasting than Cheetos and none of the harmful ""orange"" dyes or preservatives. I would highly reccommend these for your kids snacks and lunch boxes. Perfect size."
3,Could be better,"Since I am an ardent fan of Solti's 1981 London ""Figaro"", I thought that this recording might share some of the same qualities I enjoyed in it. I was disappointed. The singers all seem to be having an off-day, and the tempos are uncomfortable in many pieces. Gruberova sounds unpleasantly wiry and scoopy; Battle is pleasing except for that telling--and painful--high E in ""Zartlichkeit""; Talvela often sounds huffy and awkward, and goes sharp on his low D in the vengeance aria. The two tenors (Winbergh and Zednik) give the most pleasing of the vocal performances.I haven't yet encountered an ""ideal"" recording of this opera, but I would recommend the Weil set with Cheryl Studer and Kurt Streit very much over Solti's version."
3,It's Just a Filter,"It doesn't take much to review an air filter! LOL But, it is a pricey K&N air filter. I can't say I have seen any improved performance with my surface drive mud motor. But, it will eventually pay for itself by being able to keep re-using it. I have had K&N's in my automobiles and have had no issues with them either. They are pretty bullet proof."
5,Great!,"This was also my first. It is a great book to learn from. I gained more knowledge from this book than I ever could have from a teacher. It covers different styles from textured melodies (Soma) to all out rock (Geek U.S.A - wanna learn a pentaconic scale?). Aside from the much lauded teaching abilities, this book faithfully reproduces every song from the album for a live performance of 2-4 guitars. It is wonderful. Get this and the album for your son or daughter that are just starting to get into playing music. The musical score included with the tabs also makes for a fun time with a piano and other instruments the book wasn't intended for."
4,another great album,"In my personal opinion, I think this album is one of their best. The lyrics take you away, almost acting as a requiem. It;s very good kick back music, as well suitable for parties and what not. I think this is the only cool band my parents actually listen to. :)"
3,A QUICK TRIP!,"I enjoyed this book very much. After reading other books on freighter cruising, this book is like a small appetizer --- with a book like ""Around the World by freighter"" by Bob Hartley being a main course entree! This is a nice little read - but if you want lots of details choose the meatier read I've mentioned."
3,Interesting,"This book is really quite knowledgeable, however, it did feel like someone's journal, which I guess it was. Definitely not professionally written, but does give some insite to freighter travel."
4,A great pronunciation reference,"I use this book quite a bit when teaching pronunciation. While this smaller volume isn't as thorough as Celce-Murcia, et al.'s Teaching Pronunciation... I find that it's a very good supplement. I use the two books together. A practical and very classroom-oriented guide for teachers. Recommended."
4,"The book is excellent, but it contains many errors.","I used a first printing of this book during graduate studies back in '93, and although the book has gone through subsequent printings, errors remain. The errors, both editing and typo errors plus interpretative errors--are available as a three-page pdf file (1.2 MB) at eslbee.com/teaching_american_english_pronunciation_corrections.pdf . I guess I'm surprised that after fifteen years, Oxford still hasn't issued a new corrected edition. The book is clearly a five-star book were it not for its errors."
5,great,"This book is very useful for English teachers, it gives an exhausive description about the articulation of words and how to teach the phonetic symbols in an amusing way."
1,"Ugh, terrible!","The entire premise of this movie is to teach children some ""lessons"" about divorce and separation.This might have been achieved if only they clung to the entire ideal of the Sylvanian Families, and their kind hearted nature, and love of the forest! Instead some of these little creatures are outright indigent, wholly selfish and unkind! They steal from each-other for goodness sake!Not only that, but these ""lessons"" on dealing with divorce are just bizarre! Each one ends in a sort of trivial and trite manner, almost too quickly, leaving you wonder what just happened, what you were supposed to have learned, and so on...The only thing this DVD is sure to do is to taint the pure and lovely image of the sylvanian families. I implore you not to purchase it...even if it only a dollar!Oh, and BTW my copy came with sticky old tape goo on it, and hairs clinging to it.....just sayin'....ew!"
5,Excellent,I bought this for our 12*36 above ground pool and wow it did a great job. Really helped keep the pool clean of trash. The only location that was level for our little pool was under some trees and this helped to keep a lot of the leaves cleaned out of the pool. Great buy!
2,False Advertising - Game is Cheaper than it Appears,"If you are a game lover and are attracted to the nice-looking board and game pieces as much as the strategy, think twice before purchasing this game. The Oshi board is much cheaper than the one pictured. Its ends are straight and unfinished (not curved and sanded as in the picture), and ours does not even sit flat.The game pieces are very cheap plastic. Many of ours are crooked and marked up, and one was completely broken because of a poorly made metal insert that is supposed to weigh down the super-cheap plastic pieces.The game is super-simple, but we didn't try it because we're just going to return it. Very disappointing for the price."
5,This book rocks,"Anyone who has an interest in the history of Apollo will want this book. The QTVR of the landing site on the CD-ROM is absolutely killer. The QT movies on the CD-ROM remind me of something you'd see in a high-school science class (all you need is the sound of the projector), but they were still entertaining."
2,Not worth it,"I was disapointed with the book. It's mostly reprints of NASA press material and other handouts, some poorly reproduced. The photographs are presented without any sort of index, and the file names are just numbers so there is no way to tell what they are. They are low resolution scans. I had hoped for more.The 360 degree views of the landing site are fun."
2,Still waiting for my refund...,This CD had a defect in the last minute of it; I contacted the vendor and was told to return the CD and they would refund the full price plus the cost of mailing it back (they did not have a replacement in stock). It has been at least 3 weeks and still no refund. Although I'm disappointed I've always enjoyed excellent service from Amazon for years and will continue to order from them in the future.
4,Really pretty good,"The only problems were that Stratas was old and didn't sound her best, and the occasional audibleness of the prompter. Everyone else sounds great."
2,PAG without CAV,"l'idée était originale : Pagliacci sans Cavalleria, mais avec Puccini. Paris et les quais de la Seine ne débouchent sur rien : hauts murs qui cachent le ciel et aucune issue en perspective, alors que Zeffirelli campe ses Paillasses dans une région minable de la campagne italienne. Ce sont les hommes qui triomphent, ils sont jaloux et se méfient des (de La) femme. Pauvre Teresa Stratas, elle avait eu son heure de gloire, avec la Lulu de Berg-Boulez (Opéra de Paris 1979) et la Traviata de ce mme Zeffirelli. Mais ici, elle n'est plus qu'une voix sans issue, comme le paysage... Alors ténors et barytons s'en donnent à coeur joie, mme si, pour eux aussi, le coeur n'y est plus !"
4,One of the best,"Magic Treehouse books have been an excellent incentive for my 6 year old to read. At first I was reading them all to him, now he's reading them for himself. They are the perfect combination of adventure, education, and danger! This particular one is one of his favorites."
4,Buffalo Before Breakfast,Buffalo Before Before Breakfast is a book good for peoplewho are interested in Indains.
4,Very Nice Bouncer,"I bought one of these bouncers at Walmart for my daughter. She is a very fussy baby who cries WHENEVER she is awake. I placed her in the bouncer and she was content for once. I sat her in the upright position and she loved looking around and she fell asleep without crying, for the first time. The music is very cute. I always try to shop around for a cheap bouncer. This is my second bouncer I have owned. Both were the cheapest one I could find ($20). This $20 bouncer works just as good as an expensive one! Don't burn your money on those $40-$70 bouncers. This one is a good buy!!!! It's blue but my daughter looks so cute in it... so I would call it unisex. Try one out!"
3,Bouncer,"It's ok, Grandson isn't that crazy about it, but maybe it's him. I don't like the attachable arm with the rattles, it could and has come off when someone thinks they can move it by picking up on it. By 25 lbs. the child can pull it and it could hit them."
3,Not as durable as I thought!,"It is great for the first few months. My toddler(2years old) tried it once and bent it, so now once side is higher than the other. I love the different positions but there isn't one for sitting up straight and now that my baby wants to try it, she can't do it.Over all it is nice, it just lasted 3 months."
3,Not so bright,This bouncy chair is not really sturdy enough for any but the lightest of infants.The four month old we bought this for made the chair sag so that it was more of a horizontal experience than a sitting up one. Other than that it is pretty well made - it just needs to be beefed-up.
1,POS,"Really? What do you expect for the price ... Cheap construction, ugly, and cheesy. If this is what you're into, buy early and often. Mine is heading to Grandma's house, we purchased a Oeuf Bouncer after recieving this POS."
2,Not durable/hardy,"Worked great for awhile, then at 2 months old and 11.5 lbs, when my husband was bouncing it with his legs, one side just snapped and now we can't even put her in it because it leans to the side."
1,Software is NOT compatible with OS X 10.5,"Here are the documented system requirements as shown to a customer:# Macintosh:# Power Mac# 68020 or faster processor# 8 MB RAM# 80 MB hard disk space# 2x or faster CD-ROM drive# 256-color or better video display# MouseMy computer meets these requirements. However after receiving the CD a key system requirement was identified:OS 7.5 - 9Hmmm wait a minute. OS X (10.5.1) Leopard no longer supports OS 9!When you insert this CD you will get:You can't open the application ""Dr. Seuss's ABC"" because the Classic environment is no longer supportedThe little apple compatibility icon needs to be updated to reflect reality."
5,Still works with XP after all these years. 6 stars if I could,"This is likely the best kids software you are ever to see. They just don't put the care into software development these days that you see in this product.I am STILL amazed when my 4 yr old asks me to load this, at the sheer CONTENT in this, as well as the production values. Voice acting, music, animation and graphics, it's got it all, and if your kid is not engaged, they may have a problem. Seriously, it's that good. Just get it, it's what,[...]Great, great product."
4,Close to the Real Thing,"Very good album but it is probably safe to say that this band (like many others) will never capture the magic and freshness of their earlier material. Definetely better than the Trevor era material. Great melodies but missing a little in the riff department especially from Steve who has to be the most underrated guitarist there ever was. Also, Jon really needs to improve on the lyric creativity. The Children of Light and We worship the Sun stuff is getting old. 70's lyrics were definetely better."
2,Im trying to like this album...,...but I dont think I ever will. With such a great body of material under their belts these guys have no equals...but this one is a stinker. But hope springs eternal.
2,A low point in Yes's career,"Unlike many hardcore Yes fans, I do not find many redeeming qualities in this cd. The overall sound is a bit too tame. The orchestra works well at times, but not well at other times. Plus, Howe doesn't play the electric enough. He is a fabulous acoustic player and all, but I do not want to hear it that much. A couple of songs are O.K., but many of the songs sound like rehashed versions of older Yes songs without the keyboards, which are nonexistent and the music suffers greatly because of it. Yes seemed to be back on the right track with The Ladder, their first solid release since Trevor Rabin left the band, but then they release this. Perhaps Rick Wakeman rejoining the band will inspire Yes to start making real Yes music again."
5,STUNNING,"After what can only be described as a series of ""uneven"" studio efforts since re-grouping in early '96, Yes has produced a disc that can best be described as STUNNING.The material does not break new ground...it is very much ""Yes-type"" music...but it is inspired!The orchestral accompaniment...which is wonderfully complementary, not overwhelming or (even worse) merely incidental...seems to have invigorated Anderson and the entire band.This is the album I wish they'd made after GOING FOR THE ONE...oh, well...better late than never.Terrific...trust me..."
4,I'm glad I tried again with this one.....,"Negative reviewers: I hear where you're coming from. I purchased this album 5 years ago , and was not impressed (admittedly I only listened to it twice) and sold it back to a used record shop. But, man, it has aged well .. I think I finally ""get it"" -- I've been enjoying it as ""the coolest soundtrack I've ever heard"", because that is what it sounds like. I am glad Yes is evolving. And, by the way, isn't it called ""progressive"" rock anyway and therefore constantly changing by definition? If you seek Perpetual Change."
1,Drivel,"A waste of talent, energy, time and money. I was looking forward to the 'trimphant return of classic Yes' and could barely make it through to the end of the CD. Barren of ideas, rich in lush string arrangements worthy of Lawrence Welk, a posy collection of cheap and cheesy anthems that I will not listen to again."
1,What a crock,"This is still the ""same new stuff"" they've been trying to improve on for a few years now -- ever since the real magic disappeared. Yes is one of my favorite bands, and I heartily defend even the Rabin era against naysayers. Every album from 1969 through ABWH is at least very fine. But even though they are respecting the old material in concert and can still play it well, there is no more songwriting talent. And Jon insists on singing above the mix with insipid lyrics."
5,Magnification is Magnificent,"As a long time Yes fan it is hard for me to be disappointed in anything they have done. This album, thanks to the orchestral accompaniment, manages to combine passion with mysticism at a level rarely achieved in any pop-rock music. All played by masters of their respective instruments.With Steve Howe's ornamental guitar lines that somehow evokes feelings of a lonely wander in a beautiful distant land, Chris Squire's soul- striking, gunslinging bass, and Jon Anderson's not to be fully understood (in a good, mystic way) joyful lyrics, this is Yes as all Yes fans have come to know and love them. With Alan White on drums and piano, these four are the faithful core of Yes members over the years and, perhaps, their best line up (though I love Bill Bruford on drums as well). I think I prefer the orchestra as fifth member over any other.A excellent album if you are interested in giving Yes a good first listen. An essential album if you are a Yes fan."
3,Overrated,"After ""The Ladder"", I was really excited about what Yes would give us in the Future. I am dissapointed in this release.Musically it sounds like a cross between ""Open Your Eyes"" and the ""Keys To Ascension"" sessions, without anything as good as ""Mind Drive"". There are not a lot of memorable songs here. ""Soft as a Dove"" is truly awful. ""Don't Go"" is a catchy but somewhat awkward pop song for which the orchestra is overkill.The album has strong points too. The performance is good, the orchestra adds an interesting twist, there's interesting moments, but no Yes classics here. This CD could have been so much better if they had taken time to write better songs."
3,Hey Yes Fans Wake Up and Don't Write Me With Your Opinions,"This is a fair album.Brief Review Of This Group:Second Greatest Band Ever, Should Not Be In Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame because Those People Who Vote There Couldn't Shine The Shoes Of Yes. Yes is the best band since THE BEATLES!!!!! Goodbye! Please ignore the other reviews on the CDNOW website regarding the Magnification CD!!!"
5,Great CD,i recently purchased this cd and have listened to it a few times. it is very good. i am happy that i have bought it.
2,Magnified Disappointment,"Let me begin with a disclaimer. I have been a fan of Yes since the early 70s. That being said, this could possibly be the worst album they have ever released. The vocals are fabulous - Chris Squire has never sounded better, and Jon Anderson is still Jon Anderson. The music, however, lacks direction and focus. Steve Howe's guitar parts are sparing and essentially lost in the mix. The orchestra doesn't help this group at all. What is lacking from the ""Yessound"" is a talented keyboard player. There are certainly nuggets of gold to be found in this mess (Give Love Each Day is my favorite), but it is not worth sorting through the rest of the plodding arrangements to get to them. Lyrically, these guys also need to separate themselves from the Barney-like ""I love you, you love me.."" material. This is a major disappointment from a band that is certainly old enough to know better."
4,Yes is getting closer to their roots,I have the DVD-Audio and it sounds fantastic. I really haven't heard anything from Yes this good since Drama. I would like to hear the regular CD to see if it stands up as well.Very effective use of 5.1 channel surround. The songs written with Larry Groupe are my favorites and sound the most like classic Yes to me. I was pleasently surprised with this album.
5,magnificacion musical,"He seguido a esta banda por mas de 18 años, y tenia tiempos de no escuchar un album con sentido artistico, poco comercial, como en la triste era Rabin, creo que el regreso del señor Howe fue una garantia de que la banda debe hacer musica de calidad, el track 9, es supremo y de seguir asi , Yes ya no necesitara nunca mas un tecladista, este album supera grandemente a The Ladder que fue un muy buen intento"
4,"A different avenue, still a good one","This album is one of its kind in the Yes catalogue. You can't compare with any other I think. It sounds more mature and I think this is a great cd that prove that prog music can naturally be mixed with symphonic music.Congratulations to the band for their musical exploration, even after all those years. I remember hearing ""In the presence of"" in concert for the Symphonic tour. That was the first time I heard it and it was clear in my mind, that was a new Yes classic. Now that I have the cd, I can tell that I wasn't wrong ! Beautiful album !"
3,Purification?,"Magnification is the ""Let it be"" case for Yes. The compositions on Magnification belong to the best ones Yes has ever written. Andersons voice still is a revelation of purest beauty after all these years, the musicianship is masterful. However, the pseudoclassical treatment destroys this record. There are passages where Howes guitar instead of standing out as the group's true musical statement is made almost invisible by a soulless army of violins. I suggest that Yes should get rid of the orchestra and release the record newly as ""Purification""."
3,"Some good stuff, but takes getting used to","Squire still can put together dynamite bass lies, even if he's fronting an orchestra. These save the album for me, because the songs and playing are otherwise a little too mushy for me. But the bass, the bass, the bass. The riffs are tremendous, and make some of the songs really work.Still, this does not compare to KTA2's studio cuts (if you want recent Yes), or some of the other prog bands now playing at a CD near you (try Transatlatic ""Bridge"" for example)."
2,Two stars... for the orchestra,"I wonder if those claiming that this CD is the best thing since Relayer have snot in their ears. The whole CD (with few exceptions) is in 4/4! There are no mid song key changes and most of the melodies revolve around a few close notes, often only one. Without the orchestra this would be bland pop, not progressive innovation. If they were to have put this out in the 70's they would have been laughed at by bands like ""The Enid"" who did the orchestral rock thing much better.Yes lost it a long time ago. 90125, while not progressive either, was at least better pop, with guts and impact. Magnification represents the wimpification of a band that once had sharpened teeth and real emotional depth. Listen to The Gates of Delerium and tell me otherwise. Yes had power and grace. Now they have grown old and gone soft, as have the fans of this CD. I wouldnt be suprised if they recuited John Tesh as their new keyboardist. The orchestra gets two stars, Yes gets zero."
5,Best Statistics text I've ever owned!,"I'm assuming that people who buy this book don't actually need a working knowledge of statistics at the college level. You're probably more like me and want to devote as little time as possible to a foolish, state-mandated prerequisite. You MAY also have compunctions about cheating and thus feel like a bare minimum is necessary, or you might just want a backup plan. Another possibility is that you just need a refresher.This is a great guide for any of these purposes, and if you can just borrow a text for assigned problem sets it's about all you'll need during the semester or year. Don't throw your money away on a text you won't open until the night before finals. There's even a fair chance you won't USE this book - but it will still behave as placebo, comforting you into passing the most fruitless class of most majors' undergrad coursework. After all, a statistically significant majority of students forget everything on the finals night pub crawl."
4,Outstanding refresher,"This handy little book has been a real help for me . I took Stats 5 years ago, and the layout of this book presents the basics in an excellant format for review,"
4,Sadistics,"This is a pretty good book to provide you with the basics of statistics. Overall, I hate this class. It's my least favorite I've ever taken in college. I needed this book in order to pass it."
2,Statistics (Cliffs Quick Review),This product didn't seem to help my daughter with her studies. She did not understand it any better than her text books.
4,"Much Better Than The ""Average""","Having taken a competitive promotional exam three years ago, I was desperate to find some statistics book I could read and remember without touching the two textbook albatrosses that added unnecessary weight to my bookshelf. This was it.After reading this my confidence increased the ""confidence level"" in which I calculated that there was a good probability that I would pass the test among a large, non-random population. (People never get ""random"" right. I wonder why).It is also a great little review since probability is one of the fastest things to escape my long-term memory, and I can grab this little yellow and black-striped gem for easy recollection and consumption. It states things easily and simply--just the way I like it. It is very easy to follow. (I gave away the expensive versions.)The odds are this will be your best bet. This book is much better than the average."
3,Good for a partial review,"This book reviews the basics of ""descriptive"" statistics very well. Because of this, it is great for the intro stats student. Although it touches on regression, it does not cover the analytical areas very well.So, if you only have that high school or one semester stats course to get through, buy this book."
3,"Decent pizza pan, but not the best","I like pizza pans with holes in them because the pizza tends to get crispier on the bottom. I've also been known to make cinnamon rolls, bicuits, and even baked crab cakes on this style of pizza pan because I like the way the food cooks more evenly, quickly, and gets slightly crispy on the bottom.This pizza pan claims to be metal spatula safe, and comes with instructions in English, Spanish, and French. A pizza dough recipe is included on the back of the label.Although this is a cheap pizza pan of reasonable quality, I still prefer my old one because it has many more holes allowing for a better crust."
5,Great for gluten free baking....,Bought this pan as I needed a pizza pan that would truly be nonstick for gluten free baking which is stickier than wheat based doughs. Am happy to report that it worked and our pizzas have slipped right off after baking. Did dust with cornmeal first which helps as well as adds a little extra texture to the crust. It is large but no problem using it to make a smaller pizza when we so desire.
2,ZZZzzzzzzz.....(Don't wake me)......zzzZZZZZZ,"Absolutely boring.Thin, superficial, drawn out, tedious.No research done at all, apparently, in preparing this book.Supposed to be based on historical character, but appears to be based on hearsay experienced thru the years by the author, who obviously had very limited recall.Sad."
4,"Decent book with nice pictures, but a bit pricey...","This book certainly is useful for an aspiring luthier to have on one's bookshelf as it walks one through building a solid body guitar. I'd recommend buying a discounted or used copy though, since other books in a comparable price range tend to give more information. The price probably has to do more with being a Hal Leonard book with glossy cover and color photography, then being a comprehensive guitar building grimoire. Martin Koch's book may be a better buy though the difficulty curve may be a bit higher.However to Hirst's credit, his book is geared toward the aspiring luthier with limited woodworking experience."
3,Hobbiest rather than luthier written,"Hobbiest info rather than luthier based instructions. No book can describe how to build, takes lots and lots of trial and error. Put down the books and go out there and do it. :)"
4,"Pride & Preditor review Kindle Ebook, Amazon.","I really like the Ben Reese Books and am sorry when I finish reading each one.However, they are a bitdifficult to get interested in, in the beginning. The thought processes are a little long and drawn out.The story lines are good and as I said before I like them."
2,Pride & Predator,"This book almost drove me insane , the constant mixing of American English and British English is truly awful .Not to mention the mistakes about English / Scottish life .The fact that the plot was quite good was the only thing that kept me reading it .I will not be buying another ."
3,Overdone...,"Too much exposition, not enough action or illumination of characters. Too many extraneous details in most descriptive passages, especially scenery and weather. Also too many faux suspects, too many road trips, and far too much Scottish history. Definitely will not buy another book in this series."
3,Great....but....,"M2M's first single, Don't Say You Love Me, is catchy & it is also the theme song from Pokemon movie. This song sounds perfect when you first listen to it. After a few more times, you'll get sick of the song."
5,Solid High-School Level Book,"This book is an excellent high-school level book with a no frills approach. The book is well organized, with plenty of problems to master the subject. My nine year-old daughter is using it learn geometry."
1,Ahhhhh!!!,"Wow, this book stinks, and as with the previous review, it is my only resource. Enjoyment? I'd kill myself befre I enjoyed this. There is no way to understand this book without a real teacher (yeah, one that teaches). Unlike Ms.Boyland who can't teach. Thank you and Good-day"
1,Student Of a teacher who used this book,"This is the first year that I have been taught by a person who used this book and I greatly dislike this book. It is the poorest example of educational material that I have ever seen. The material is presented in a way that the student is required to ""rediscover"" the material before it is taught to them. They are required to solve problems which require material from many chapters later in the book. Also, they restrict the use of the information the students already have in their minds in the solving of the problems by making them solve them using the FEW methods they have already ""learned"". I advise you all to stay as far away from this book as possible."
1,This is a waste of money,"I have had two of these label printers and both times, they have stopped functioning after a few months. When I contacted Seiko to replace the first one, they refused and said they bore no responsibility for a faulty product. TGhey told me to contact Amazon who after some arm twisting, agreed to replace it. The second one is now also not working, but instead of me wasting valuable hours trying to fight to get a replacement, I'm going to dump it in the trash where it belongs and buy a Dynmo one which my colleague has which works perfectly. Seiko Instruments SUCKS."
5,A truly great live album,"The Station Inn is a great place to hear live music in Nashville, I have been there often. Wish I had been there when they recorded this CD. Gail Davies and her band does a superb job and the recording quality is excellent. That lady has a set of pipes and she really shows them off on this one. Great songwriter, too, I understand. The CD is almost studio quality, Gail and the band making no mistakes, with tight arrangements and great integration of vocals and inststrumental breaks. You will enjoy this CD, trust me."
5,masterpiece,union jack along with terra ferma are masters of audio electronic art. do your soul a favor and look into what their vibrations have to offer. there is a reason it is so hard to find their cds. get what you can while you can. colkett...
1,This game sucks!!!!!,"This has got to be the worst game I have ever played. They used false advertising. It said Shooter as the genre. YOU DONT EVEN AIM OR SHOOT THE GUN. You tell the 8 soldiers you control to shoot the bad guys but they cant even aim good and they dont shoot unless you tell them to. Even if they are going to die they dont shoot. You cant even walk around you tell the soldiers where to go. Also on the box it says its based on a army training thing. I thought it would be a action packed shooter because thats what it looked like on the box, but I was wrong. There is no action at all, you just move around while you see a couple bad guys who just wound half your guys. I rented this game from Blockbuster, went home and put it in my PS2, played it for 25 minutes then brought it back to Blockbuster. If all US army soldiers trained on something like this the US army would be the worst army in the world."
5,Good old days!,"This album brought back fond memories of high school and the teen years. I couldn't afford the album then, but I've got it now!!"
2,Not what I remembered,"I first heard Brother Dave when I was a young teenager, and remembered him as being funny. But after hearing this album after 40 years had passed, I didn't laugh much at all. I cringed a lot. Don't order this one unless you're a right-winger, preferably from the South! (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)"
1,The Very Best of Brother Dave Gardner,"A sad compilation. There is but one track, so you can not play one selection. The cuts are done so that the full story is not told. May be the not so funny parts of the story were removed. If you are a Dave fan you may enjoy this, but don't try to share it with the unwashed."
1,Can you say racist?,"If you're into un-funny political humor from the Vietnam era and enjoy offensive racist remarks thrown in here and there, you'll love this cd. If, however, you have a brain, spend your money on something else."
3,Something to Offend Every One,"While people tend to complain that ""Brother"" Dave was racist, they should also note that he was an equal opportunity offender, mocking every one from evangelists to politicians to motorcyle gang members to small town policitians--name a stereotype and you will find Gardner casting an aspersion upon it. At the same time, it is also perfectly true that Gardner was very much of his place and time, and in this (hopefully) more enlightened, more tolerant age it is sometimes difficult to find genuine humor in his work. Perhaps his recordings are best regarded as a time capsule, something by which we measure how far we have come over the past thirty years. But say what you like: I STILL love the motorcycle story!"
3,"Good material, bad sound...","I gave it 3 stars overall, because the quality of the sound was very poor...I had to turn it way up to hear him, then scrambled to turn it down, when the laughter/applause exploded through the speakers....The material was good, not excellent..... I have every one of Jerry Clower's recordings, but think I'll stop at this one of Brother Dave.... We use comedy recordings on road trips, and it was kind of a hassle having to constantly monkey around with the volume. The most interesting thing was his references to ""current events"" of 25+ years ago, but the subject matter was still relevant today, only the names of the ""players"" have changed......"
2,format of the CD,The quality of the audio is good; however the CD does not have tracks so listening to it is very annoying because you can't go to the different titles listed on the cover.....I wish they would have said this on the description before I purchased from this publisher.
5,A trek down Memory Lane,Brother Dave was going strong many years ago when I was a teenager. I recently happened to think of the LP's my friends and I used to listen to in those days so I checked with Amazon to see if they were available on CD. I know that his recordings are very politically incorrect these days but I ordered anyway. I don't mean any disrespect to anybody but I need a good laugh when I can find one.
4,Night Lamp - A Journey Into the Worlds of Jack Vance,For Jack Vance fans - and anyone who has never ventured into the world of Science Fiction and Fantasy - Night Lamp rates near the top of his efforts. A journey with Vance has always been a pleasure - this trip is especially so.
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Jaro is a boy that remembers nothing but his name, nothing at all abouthis past, who his parents are, or any of that stuff. His foster parentsadopt him after finding him being attacked.They are a pair of musicians, but Jaro does know what the doesn't want to be a musician, but to get into space.A few bad jokes here, with all the clubs on the planet - a girl he notices is a clam muffin, for example.No Sour Grapes Bunch that I remember."
1,not The Vance I used to read,"I were very disappointed, similar bad as Araminta 1-3. I think it's 10% original Vance, 50% + 40% self plagiat and ghostrighter. The last good Vance was Lyonesse I and I've read read nearly everything that was published of JACK VANCE."
4,"Good Value, Really Nice Looking","I purchased these speakers to replace my Altec-Lansing ADA-880 speakers that were fried by a lightning strike/power surge. I chose these speakers because they do not look stupid, like so many of the new speakers being sold. These are very nice looking speakers. They are not some goofy space-man looking piece of crap. They will work great with your computer, or any other audio device with an 1/8th inch stereo plug. They produce respectable sound, and a fair amount of bass. If you like TONS of bass, that you can feel thumping in your chest, (like the exceptional ADA-880 speakers that are no longer available,) you will be a little disappointed. I would have rated them a 5 if they produced more bass."
4,A very thorough account of very little concrete knowledge,"Serge Lancel thoroughly and thoughtfully outlines the archaelogical evidence uncovered at the site of Carthage. This shows how little first-hand knowledge we still have about the lifestyle and ideas of a race that narrowly missed out on being the progenitor of the world's leading civilization in place of Rome. M. Lancel tries his best to fill in the gaps, but it is evident that most history of Carthage, as we know it today, was written by its bitter enemies. The book does not cover the Carthaginian colonies in Europe and their archaelogical yields to the same extent and should be complimented with a suitable text on this subject. Dr I Englin."
4,Clean,These ATH M20 headphones were purchased for a JamHub silent studio for a band that I manage. They are crisp and clean. The band loves them.
4,"Good for the money, even better for a bit more.","While these headphones may seem to only offer a high degree of comfort they can in-fact pack a serious punch. For just a little bit more you can also get thisFiiO E5 Headphone Amplifier. These Headphones are designed to take some punch to get going because they are monitor headphones, and they do not noise cancel. But if you put that Headphone amplifier on it you can't even turn it up halfway or you will melt your own face off. I can't even turn it up a third of the way without my eye sockets bleeding.In my honest opinion, I think these headphones and an amp will do the job for [...] bucks. So if you don't want to spend $[...] on some really kickin' headphones, this will do the trick."
2,Very comfortable but low volume,"It's very comfortable and feels very nice, but its function is lacking.I put my volume to the max and I still couldn't hear half the volume of what my cheap plastic headphones do.The sound quality is there but if you want volume, I suggest getting another headphones."
3,Comfortable but that's about it,"For a few dollars more, one is much better off with the M30. In fact, I don't see any reason to recommend these other than they are $30 and comfortable. Beyond that, the sound is lacking in lows, middles and highs. Other than that, they're great!"
5,Best bang for Your buck,"I purchased these headphones after doing some extensive research. I found that these headphones listed for 22 dollars was practically a steal compared to others listed at the same price. They are durable, comfortable, and the sound is not distorted. that is all one looks for in a pair of cans at this price which is harder to find then one might think."
4,"I used them for the past 2 years, and they still work but there are some cracks","I used them for two years and they still work fine. The sound is good. However, there are some cracks on the part that touches ears. I took good care of them and used them with the computer at home only."
3,average,"They're fine, they're headphones, they get the job done and they don't hurt your ears no matter how long you wear them. They can adjust to a larger head size but if you need a smaller size, you are out of luck."
1,Nothing special here,"When I placed my order, I was hoping that the headphones would live up to the hype; unfortunately, that is not the case.The headphones reproduced almost no bass. I do not mean that they do not produce over powering bass; as a comparison that typical people will understand, they produce bass somewhat comparable to a late 90s laptop speaker, even at high volume.The high range had a slight hiss, which was also distracting.After listening to them for around fifteen minutes or so, I repackaged them and sent them back to the seller. To be honest, this was the only item I have ever returned from online shopping. If they were the full price ($69.00), I would have been furious.tl;dr: No low range and high range hiss."
1,Sound is SO LOW!!,"These are trash. With the size of these you expect to hear some damage when theyre all the way turned up but even at max i can hear everything (EVEN MY IPOD HEADPHONES ELIMATES SOUND)For $30 you can get MUCH better, the only good thing about these are the padding and its really comfortable"
4,"Shallow cups, but good","The cups are a bit shallow yet wide and the band fits a bit big, but not worth returning them (I'm a 5'9"" male). I'm not a sound expert, but they do the job for me. I wouldn't recommend this for someone with a small head (like a girl)."
4,"Good sound, but definitely not soundproof","For the price, these do a great job. The one downside is that they don't keep the sound out. When I fly, I like to be able to drone out the sounds of crying babies and this didn't really do the trick. Even though they are bulky, they were very comfy and allowed me to sleep with them on."
5,Sound quality is really good.,"I got this on a deal (Black Friday deals on Amazon) and so far it's wonderful... It's comfortable, it looks cool and sound quality is almost perfect. Definitely a must have."
1,The worst movie I own,"Being a movie enthusiast, my collection of over 2000 DVD's spans all types of genres from silent movies to currently made movies and anything from musicals to thrillers and everything in between. When I tried to think of which of my movies I hate most, this one comes to mind. I bought it for Orlando Bloom who I enjoyed in the Lord of the Rings movies and Pirates of the Carribean. From the beginning I didn't enjoy this. The way it was shot turned me off right from the start. The storyline wasn't much better. I had never heard of this movie but I'll buy movies I come across if they sound like they are worthwhile. This wasn't. The Bill Paxton angle was good. I watched the whole thing but kept wondering: ""Why did they waste their time with this""."
2,"bad screenplay, screenwriter, director.....",tried so hard to link and put everything together but failed by a lousy screenplay and the play writer/director. the whole movie looked like a bad patch up job. clustered randomly with bad dialog. put a bunch tough wannabes youngsters on the cayman island. the whole thing was about what? a meager one mil $$$ hedge fund? a totally clueless brainless storyline with marginal acting performances by all the players. 2-star rating is already too generous just for the peek-a-boo views of the cayman island.
4,"Great Plot, Bad Editing.","'Haven' is a great movie in the same vein of 'Crash'and 'The Illusionist' you think you know what's really going on untill you reach the end of the movie. The preformances are superb especially by Orlando Bloom 'Shy'. I was exceptionally suprised, he experiments with a touch of his commedic side and succeeds and should try and find more work tailored to that strength. Zoe Saldana's 'Andrea' preformance is heartbreaking and beautiful especially in the scene with her school's counselor."
4,A little gem of a movie,"Sometimes it's hard to understand why - or why not - films are released. This one, shot in 2004, I believe, hasn't seen the big screen so far, it was only shown at some festivals. Which is a pity, as it shows an ensemble of fantastic actors in a gripping story. It's worth seeing this one. Bill Paxton as a not quite so legal business man is great, and so is Orlando Bloom, portraying here a shy boy with a soft heart. Zoe Saldana as his sweetheart is good, too. Unlike many movies this one isn't shallow - no marshmallow rosy days, no all dreams come true, but cruelsome sometimes, touching and very moving."
3,Tragic love story,"the introduction of all the characters had me baffled at first. I couldn't see the connection. It wasn't until Shy(Orlando Bloom) went to the party that everything came together. The language was a bit rough but all in all I enjoyed the movie. Isn't that what it's about, enjoying and being entertained. I found myself in tears at the end because of the broken lives that seem to stem from one incident. Those who are left behind to figure out what went wrong and why. I must admit I got the movie because Orlando Bloom was in it. I love everything he does. This is no exception. Other than the language and a few indiscreet moments that could have been left out, the film did what it was suppose to do, entertain me."
4,Great!,"Whether you are a professional hypnotherapist or just interested in hypnotherapy, this text will give you a great basic introduction to many of the aspects of hypnosis. Say what you will about Dr. Krasner, the truth remains that he has done a great deal for the advancement of hypnosis, and hypnotherapy. This book will give the reader the tools needed to begin!"
3,For a collector,"Good for a collector, not a toy. The hand broke when my 10 yr old attempted to play w/ it. It seems to be a sturdy for display only."
2,Not as good as the original.,"Not as good as the original. They've changed the mix for my favorites, and they don't sound as good."
1,POP GARBAGE,"Something that someone who claims to be COUNTRY should NOT do. Even though these girls are already pop, remixing it to make it even more pop was a HUGE mistake! Then again, they have to do something to sell more cd's! LOL!!!"
2,Whoa.....,"What the heck happened on this cd? All mixed up is the very appropriate title in this case! Why take something that was perfect the way it was, and make it less than that? Almost every song sounds out of place with the background music. You can tell the vocals were lifted and other music was added to achieve this disaster. So many other bands have also tried this and failed as well. Listen to the clips before you buy, thank goodness I did! They are a FABULOUS group regardless and the way to go would be to do an acoustic album next time."
1,What the *heck* is this?,"I don't think SheDaisy will last much longer. A remix album?? SheDaisy is pulling a Paula Abdul: releasing a remix album just to sell a few more copies. I had this album for 2 hours and returned it to the store for something else. Seriously, this is very dissappointing. They are seriously pushing the line of country-pop.. they should re-consider their image and just focus on doing just pop."
5,The evolution of Bebop from 1949 to the present day,"In Bebop, Scott Yanow offers a 391-page compendium of insights, anecdotal biographies, essays, and reviews of jazz music and the musicians that created this authentically American art form. Bebop explores the early roots and influences of jazz (1937-44); the pioneers and key players, singers, and band leaders of the classic Bebop era (1945-49); and the evolution of Bebop from 1949 to the present day. Also features is a unique survey of LPs an CDs released through 1999 by both vintage Bebop performers and contemporary Bebop-based musicians. From Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Thelonious Monk to Sarah Vaughen, Miles Davis, and Sonny Rollins, Bebop offers fresh perspective, new discovers, and insightful commentary. This is a ""must"" for all personal, professional, and academic popular music history and reference collections."
1,Dissapointed,"I am many times dissapointed by Scott's approach to jazz. It highlights the already known information. For the amount of Jazz History he touts himself to know, I was dissapointed."
3,McDougall Recipes,"Worth the purchase. My wife likes it so therefore I'm OK with it, too. Looking foreword to the first test."
3,"easy to follow recipes, simple directions.","research (colin campbell's book: the china study) show that this is the way to health. it's not easy to follow this diet, but the mcdugalls make it simple."
1,"samo,,,samo",This book is no better than any other book out in the market. I wasted my money again.Save your money.
1,Not all recommendations are equal,"After trying 4 recipes at random and saying either why or ""yuck"" I put this back on the shelf. It's not for me. I felt I was wasting time and food money. Even the pizza recipe resulted in something barely edible. The crust was like a piece of masonite, and I know I followed the instructions to the T.This came recommended to me, so I purchased it with high hopes. I've never been so disappointed in a cookbook.I've been looking for recipes which will help me eat healthier and I'm still looking. No help for me here."
2,Not very adaptable for the everyday family.,This cookbook is very ridiculous! I'm a mother of two small children and I cannot easily prepare these recipes with ingredients that are common in the kitchen. I need something that is easily adaptable to the everyday family. This book was not it.
4,"At the bottom of the well, this book is a rope.","Leaving medicine is probably second only to being sued as a source of loneliness and confusion. This book will assure that you're not crazy for no longer wanting to practice medicine--nor are you stupid, irresponsible, or antisocial. Doctors, as the book explains, leave the bedside for plenty of legitimate reasons. It goes through the psychology behind people's decisions to quit, invites the reader to carefully consider and elucidate his own reasons, and offers suggestions for smoothing the transition. It also offers contact information for helpful organizations. It does emphasize the more common paths of business, the corporate world, or law, and doesn't offer much to those of us pursuing writing or the arts. Still, it's full of wisdom. I wore it dog-eared for a few months."
3,Good Info but Pricey!,"Actually I was already familiar with this book; I had purchased it from the AMA but my copy sustainedsome water damage while in storage. It's now out of print with the AMA. It's a good introductionfor people considering leaving clinical practice, but come on! 350 dollars for a new copy? Iknow people want out of medicine, but that sort of price gouging is unfair. I sprung for a usedcopy in fair but usable condition. It's probably a must-buy for people considering making achange, but the markup makes my blood boil!"
1,really bad vid,"omg this is awful, the vid is horrible even when i put it in my never used old vhs terrible, dont buy it, jane would not want you to buy it"
3,"good, but flawed","This introductory Croatian teach-yourself grammar is nicely laid out, pedagogically quite good, but it is also flawed: other than several minor errors in the exercises, it contains instances of vocabulary that Croatians react strongly to as reflecting rather the Serbian form of the language than the Croatian (e.g. the verb ""happen""; some forms of the interrogative). The transition from a Serbo-Croat grammar to a Croatian grammar is not entirely successful. The accompanying CD is a nice start as an audio accompaniment, but only of limited help as the speakers speak FAR too fast, and while the CD tracks are numbered they are not labelled, so one has no easy way to relate them to the paragraphs and exercises in the book. Moreover, in several minor instances, the text being read on the CD does not match the text in the book."
4,Flu Tablets,Had the first symptoms of flu and tried these out. Seemed to help but still had a few days of being miserable. Better than being sick for a week!
2,Carl Craig talks over all the songs on Disc 1,"I bought this for my husband - and was surprised to find that Carl Craig talks all over every song in disc 1. It's unlistenable. The Laurent Garnier disc is fine (no talking), though."
1,Kings of Heck-No,"WTF. First of all they switched it and had LG doing the Detroit mix and Carl ""can't"" Craig doing the Euro mix. Laurent Garnier is great. The mix, well, so so, but he did mix it all up from disco to hip and trip hop, to techno. But Mr. Craig. Please shut up! He spoke over every track and the blends could of been done better by a seeing eye dog. Detroit is awesome, but I think Derrick May should pimp slap Craig and take over as the ruling Techno King of the 8 mile. 2 thumbs and big toes DOWN!"
5,Best Way To Learn About Ayahuasca Without Going to South America,"I've seen lots of westerners preaching about ayahuasca in a sort of Terence McKenna, new age way. They never let the actual shamans who work with this ""sacred plant"" (actually a blend of two plants) talk about their work in any real depth. Enter Alberto Villoldo, a man with a foot in the world of western medicine and one in the world of the Amazonian shamans who work with plants and nature to effect what we sometimes think of as ""miracle"" cures. Although he is the presenter of the film and does a good job, he also really let's the local healers share their knowledge.If you have any interest in using ayahuasca medicinally, you should watch this film. If you are just curious about shamanic use of plants, it's for you too. Highly recommended."
2,Synthesizer!?,"Charles Dutoit has excellent command of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, and they do quite a nice job of performing these popular Tchaikovsky works. However, I must say that I was completely taken aback by the use of a synthesizer in the last couple of minutes of the 1812 Overture. This may be the single least tasteful thing that I have ever heard done on a classical album. If this was crossover classical I could almost understand. But how is this allowed to happen by such a respected conductor as Dutoit and such a respected label as Decca?"
4,good winter boots,"got these good delivered right to my front door and have wore them ever since, being winter in ohio and all, i couldnt be more pleased and might get another pair in a different color. now i need a summer pair. signed happy in ohio, bill"
3,not a year-round boot,"I didn't realize that this was more of a winter boot rather than a year-round boot. The lining is a bit heavy (nice and warm for winter), but I don't think I'll be wearing these boots past March. They are comfortable enough, though - maybe a bit higher than I would have liked."
3,Peliminary,It is too early to review this product. I purchased the boots forwinter wear and have not worn them yet. From first observation theboots appear to be very good and will suite my requirements perfectly.
2,"Too flat, you will need insoles","Very good looking boots, but they can be uncomfortable, the base is too flat, i had to order special soles to make them usable, later I found that they seem to be not very long lasting I dont think they are going to make it for the year"
2,Flimsy and unsteady,"The incredible light weight of this product makes it very top-heavy when attaching a camcorder. The result is an uneasy feeling that it will topple over, especially if something were to knock against it. Compounding the problem are the feet of the tripod which make very poor contact with the ground, thus adding to its instability. The verticle control that allows for the camcorders altitude to be adjusted is jerky thus resulting in shaky recordings. Overall this is a badly designed tripod that I would neither recommend nor trust with my own camcorder."
2,Broke easily,"I agree with the previous reviewer. Although it worked fine when I used it, not long after it simply broke at one of the cheap connections on the leg and is now unusable. I do not recommend."
1,lightweight but not a good construction,I used this tripod for my Canon S1 IS. The first one broke within 30 days so I replaced it with another one considering its light weight. The second one lasted only for another 10 months. It broke at the attachment near the middle spindle. Not a good construction.
5,Cream of the Crop,"This album is my favorite Tracy Nelson release. I've been waiting a long time for it to be released on CD. I first bought it in the 70's and fell in love with her voice and the soul that came through in her music.The tune selection here is excellent...from a duet with the then rather unknown (except in country circles) Willie Nelson, and gems such as Slow Fall.This CD is worth every penney. Her best...and she's produced a lot of exceptional CDs. Don't hesitate in purchasing this one. You won't be sorry."
3,"Visually beautiful, story drags.","Marlon Brando returns home from the Civil War, a worn out Confederate soldier with only one thing of value left to his name, the Appaloosa. He immediately gets entangled in a bitter struggle between a Mexican bandit, well played by John Saxon, and his woman. Saxon ends up stealing the Appaloosa and Brando, who only wants to be left alone, is forced the follow him into Mexico to retrieve his prize stallion. There is some interesting bi-play between Brando and characters along the trail, and a great arm wrestling match over killer scorpions. The problem for me was it took too long to get to the final showdown. The way Brando smokes Saxon out in the end was pretty clever, however, if a shade hard to believe. Worth seeing just to see Brando and Saxon and the fantastic scenery."
2,Brando Sleepwalks Through Dull Western,"Co-star John Saxon memorably summed up the basic storyline of ""The Appaloosa"" (1966): ""Boy meets horse, boy loses horse, boy gets horse."" No wonder Marlon Brando looks bored in this lackluster effort - he's doing little more than fulfilling a Universal contract. Russell Metty's impressive photography is offset by the pretentious direction of Sidney J. Furie. It's a pity that Brando never made a truly outstanding Western."
2,"indifferent acting, sluggish plot make this a dud","Marlon Brando was a great actor, but that doesn't mean that everything he did was great. In this film, which you can tell he didn't take seriously because he barely acts, the only thing he adds is a little atmosphere. The story is also ridiculously unrealistic: the lone wolf setting out for revenge against a bunch of greasy, really bad Mexicans. He dreams of starting a ranch, has an extended family he loves, meets a (stunningly beautiful) abused woman (by the baddies, and yes, he saves her and maybe falls for her). There are a few fun scenes, like the arm wrestle or the glinting rifle, but this does not a movie make.Not recommended."
3,Good plot but it moves slowly,"It is good to see Marlon Brando again in this 1956 western, although he is not really given a good chance to show his acting skill. John Saxon plays a Mexican bandit with many henchmen, and does a very good acting job. It is 1870, and Brando has returned to the area where he grew up with some money to start a ranch and an appaloosa horse. He admits to a priest that he has killed men and women in war and now wants peace. Unfortunately, Saxon and his men steal Brando's horse, and Brando feels compelled to go and retrieve his property despite the overwhelming odds against him. The film focuses for the most part on his encounter with Saxon and his men, the difficulties that he has, and his attempt to rescue a woman that Saxon is holding captive."
4,A STORY OF HATS,"1966. An American spaghetti western directed by a Canadian director. Remember the arm wrestling between Marlon Brando and John Saxon with two scorpions as spectators ? It was in THE APPALOOSA. You can now find a superb zone 2 DVD of this movie, in a pristine copy, at Amazon.fr."
3,"Nice Appaloosa, good actors, slow plotting","Matt Fletcher (Marlon Brando), is a tight-lipped loner who returns from the Civil War to his surrogate family in the border town of Ojo Prieto to settle down. When Matt's prize Appaloosa stallion (played by Cojo Rojo) is stolen by bad banditos and spirited away to Mexico, he goes after them with a vengeance. Somewhat slow, and the title character isn't in the movie all that much.Staci Layne Wilson"
4,A good choice for basic users,"I've been using this for about six months to connect my DVD player and, occasionally, my laptop to my TV. The picture is fine, and I haven't had any compatibility issues, but it definitely weakens my cable signal. Most channels are fine, but some that appear clear with a direct connection to my TV show some static when the cable passes through this box first.Overall, it's the best option I was able to find (after lots of looking) for basic modulation. It was very important to me to have an S-Video connection, and now I have one that works great."
3,RF Modulator,When playing a DVD the picture has faint waves in the background but at least I can use a television that I normally wouldn't be able to for watching DVDs.
3,It did the trick but.....,"Does what I need it to do but I thought it was supposed to be new, which it clearly wasn't. Lot's of scratches, it was pretty beat up."
1,Zero stars.,"How did this product get such a high star rating? The first one that I got, the light did not even turn on. Junk. After asking the company about the issue, they speedily sent me a replacement (they didn't even want the other one back or ask for further details - indicator that this happens frequently?). The new one they sent could turn on its light but the modulator did nothing else. Junk. Do not buy. Finally, I ended up getting a different brand, Philips (universal DVD Converter SWS2100W/27 - worked right out of the package)."
1,works 50% of the time,"I purchased two of these boxes to adapt a new dvd player to older tvs.One box works great. Plug it in, does what it's supposed to, no problem.One box garbles the audio and fragments the video images. I reported problem to seller and have yet to recieve any response.Seller problems aside, the product had a 50% sucess rate. Is that high enough for you?"
2,works but little fuzzy,It works but is a little fuzzy but my daughter is to young to care or notice but in future will need better one
4,Review Dynex WS-007 RF Modulator,"Wow! The product arrived really quick and it was also packaged nice and neat, what a great deal once again Amazon. It is exactly as pictured and it definately will help so that I can watch DVDs on my old TV set."
3,Fuzzy picture,"This thing was doubling and/or tripling the picture when I had a game console hooked up to it, the shadow images made it look really fuzzy. And it acted weird based on what I had plugged into it, it had light tripling with just S-video, heavy tripling with just RCA, and just doubling with both hooked up. Not recommended. I got a $30 box from the store and it works great."
4,The Cat in the Hat software,"This is a wonderful way to get young kids interested in the computer. The software follows the book almost word for word, plus the words appear on the screen, and are highlighted when said. Your child has the option of allowing the book to be read to them or playing within the pages. My daughter has been using this since she was two and a half. She loves to click on the various items on the screen and see the action. This is her favorite software. It is nonthreatening, and fun, plus kids become more familiar with the words as they appear on the screen. Highly recommend for 2-5."
5,The Cat in the Hat is Alive!,"I recommend this interactive book to anyone with small children. My 4 year old loves the read and play portion of the program. My 2 year old, who doesn't sit still long enough to catch her breath turns on the computer and insists on Cat in the Hat. As she is not quite old enough to handle the mouse on her own, I click the read segment for her. She sits through the entire book laughing at the Cat's silly antics, repeating words, and humming along with the music. It is the best of both worlds, a classic children's story come alive."
1,Not working in computer,"I've been unable to get this software to work on the computer, despite the virtually identical green eggs and ham software working just fine."
3,Less than stellar.,"The graphics used in the book are the same as the ones used in the awful ""Russian in ten minutes a day"" by Kristine Kershul. This is somewhat better, but not by much. Many of the words in the book don't have the stress, or accent displayed, so for those words it's sort of useless. You get the stress for the ""spotlight"" words which are phonetically transliterated (the stressed syllables are in capitals).I purchased the book and cassette version used for cheap. In that context - it was worthwhile, but for not much more, the Oxford Press ""Take off in Russian"" by Nick Ukia was superior. If you're really serious about learning Russian, there is no substitute for the Penguin Russian course. It really is the benchmark by which all beginners texts are judged."
2,Too advanced for beginners,"The pronouncation exercises in the audio cassettes move too fast for the beginning student of Russian. There is not enough time given for the student to pronounce the words and phrases after the speaker. Also, the authors evidently assume that by listening, one will learn. This may be true but, since the dialogue moved so quickly, even with the pauses provided, I found the entire study to be extremely frustrating and finally substituted it with another more satisfying method. I would not recommend this book and cassettes to beginners."
2,Not enough for conversation,"The book is okay for a beginner. You do learn cyrillic pretty quickly. However transaltions are increasingly sparse, and the book spends almost no time on having a normal conversation. If you are only looking to be able to get around in Russia without actually talking to anyone there about things other than directions, this is your book."
1,Misleading,"I've had this book for nearly a week and I STILL can't speak Russian fluently, so that disproves the ""fast"" bit. ""Fast"" is when I pour my wife a gin and tonic, and she's finished drinking hers before I've even made mine. Nothing about this book is ""Fast"". Also, there are no jokes, humorous anecdotes or suggestions for accelerated learning in enjoyable situations, so that pretty much knocks the ""fun"" thing on the head as well. Given a choice of struggling this book or watching England triumph over the Aussies at Edgbaston, I know which I'd choose to do for ""fun""! This book should really have been called ""Learn Russian: the not very rapid and only moderately pleasant way""."
1,Virtual farmer,I STILL have not received this item. I can't review it if I haven't received it. I find this very annoying.
1,This is NOT the blues king Peter Green!,"If you love the blues, stay away from this! This has been mistakenly linked to the name of Fleetwood Mac founder Peter Green. This is some other guy with the same name, not the blues genius. This is some sort of experimental techno junk, and any blues fan who buys it will regret having spent the money for ""music"" not even Yoko Ono would claim. I made the mistake. Don't let this happen to you."
2,"Schiff is good, but wimpy","Listen to Glenn Gould's WTC II first. Schiff does an excellent contrapunctal work, but drags a little bit on tempi and does not have the same level of hypnotic effects as Gould achieves."
1,"""Cheap construction""","This saw uses less than quality materials and is manufactured with very lax tolerances. Welds are ground off, painted over and have holes. I could do better with caulk and paint. There are NO assembly instructions. The only guide to aid in putting it together is a parts lits. Some parts do not work, ie, nuts and bolts with irregular threads. I would not buy this item again. I don't think it will last and the shipping charges are outrageous. I paid a lot to ship to Texas and now see those charges are half of what they were when I purchased 3 weeks ago?????Cheap, cheap, cheap. Go to a butcher supply and spend your money there."
4,Palm Springs + Murder = Fun,"Thoroughly enjoyable fast-paced mystery. There's enough twists and turns, and the characters seem very real. A fast, fun read."
2,We miss Hamburger Hamlet in P.S.,"Poor editing, bad grammar (page 143 ""all so"" for the word also - and that's just a starter!). An author should not edit his own material. Book could have been 1/3 the size, provided the author stuck to the point, removed many tiny, unimportant sentences or at least combined them into one readable sentence rather than short, choppy ones. Interesting read - good story line - would try his works again, provided the book was properly edited."
5,chainsaw lumberjacking at its best!,"I don't need a 1,000 words to describe this book. The author is a man who has worked with the problems in the field, which this author knew little about except for the troubles involved. We never had really top-class equipment. This book is worth the price charged now for just his insight on chain design and sharpening alone. With the notes in this book one can save his saw, his equipment and get the job done much more quickly than if you do not have his notes and observations. I find the points of the author well arranged and most useful for our purposes. Thank you,Mr. Will Malloff! If you are out there we would like to hear from you!"
2,Seems to work as described. Compex set-up.,"This unit is practically the only telephone switching system available to a consumer. It seems to have all the features for routing voice or fax calls I had this unit only a few days though and wasn't able to verify that it would do all I wanted.Setup procedures are confusing, despite a detailed manual. My first call to Tech Support didn't help at all, but the follow-up was very good. They actually called me!"
2,Ask Questions twice!!,"Command Communications 4-Port Comswitch Phone/Fax Modem/Ans Machine Line Sharing Dev.I, like so many others, checked out the Comswitch 7500 first. I even called the company and asked about the compatability with my computor. I was given a go ahead from them and bought. Now I find out that a review I even read was correct. It has problems with faxing direct to computors. NOW ComSwitch says they have had problems with hook ups to U.S. Robotics 56K Voice PCI modums. This was not told to me when I asked about problems. So BeWare!!!"
5,Fax/phone switcher,"Excellent item, excellent phone support. Only negative: manual didn't indicate how to solve the problem of busy signal on phone attached to unit if a remote phone on same line was picked up first. The phone support easily resolved the problem. The answer could have been put in the manual."
3,Good while it lasts,"I've had two of these now. They are relatively easy to set up, and they do the job adequately. However, they both broke down after about 1-2 years. I can't find anything else that does the same job, so I guess my small business needs to buy a new one every year or two. It seems like they should last longer, but it is still cheaper than a new phone system."
4,Comswitch Phone/Fax 4 Port Command Communications,This replacement communication enhancement surpassed expectations. It's a turn-on (pun intended) to hear my fax happening while also receiving phone calls on a given line...and also to receive faxes without distracting phone ringtones at all hours. It did take more than one technician to help me connect it correctly...that was frustrating.
3,Suspended in Time,"Snoop clearly peaked w/ Doggie Style. Same lyrics, same content, same delivery, same skits . . . . Cuz. Best songs (2) already on radio. Maybe 1 more coming. Most effective in background (Kells/Akon duet). 3 rating for respect."
4,4 and a half- i'm 16 don't wanna make a acount,"this cd is a step ahead of 2004's R&G and more then a couple steps behind the orginal snoop doggy dogg ""doggystyle. the first half probably coulda almost made a hip hop classic but has whats coming into a habbit for the doggfather is the second half falls right off the course. but this one still has 2 tracks in the second half to keep you going"
1,A few good songs...and lots of boring ones...,"Doggystyle will still be Snoop's only great album. I bought this cd because of all the great reviews it got and the hype that the ""classic snoop"" was back...but I find this album to be very lame. Lyrically, he's still rapping about the same stuff since his first album, in the exact same way. The only song where he demonstrates his flow is ""Think about it""...it's incredible. But the rest of the album is just like every other rap song out there...uninspired. From an artistic standpoint, there are so many rappers with loads of more creativity than Snoop is showing now (take Aceyalone for example). Not only do his lyrics seem to be forced, but the music itself is annoyingly repetitive.All in all, this album is a waste of money...it would be better to buy the 3 or 4 good songs from itunes. Honestly, there are so many better rappers out there than Snoop right now..."
2,"Same old sex, drugs and violence. Boring.","Here's a line from the song Vato on this album: ""I wouldn't be the n_____ that I am if I didn't pop n____z in the mouth.""Isn't that poetic? Snoop Dogg manages to pull off an amazing feat. He makes sex, drugs and violence seem so ... boring. I feel like I am supposed to be offended. But it's too boring to be offensive. We have songs about every kind of gang violence, every kind of drug, and every kind of cheap sex. And what are we left with?He gets two stars because his approach to the city of Los Angeles is fresh and loving. Hip Hop should be local, and he does a good job with that. Otherwise it'd be a one-star."
4,Get It,"Track with R. Kelly is hott, Unedited I wanna f*** you with Akon is classic only too short it's under 3 min. Best track is #20 IMAGINE with Dr. Dre and D'Angelo. One of the top 3 Snoop Tracks of all time. Overall album is worth the buy not like most albums with a hit on the radio and a video and the rest garbage."
1,Not for me,"I bought Doggfather and hadn't bought an album since or before. I can only listen to so many songs about gangbanging, calling females the b-word, and talking about how dangerous your neighborhood is. The neighborhood songs and what you went through growing up is cool on one or two songs, but not a whole album. I definitely don't get this roll call on how many women a rapper did--seems rather high-schoolish to me. I listened to this album on AOL's Music, but by the time I got to ""A B**** I Knew"" I rolled my eyes and gave up. The beats are tight and I'd buy the instrumental. I like his delivery and rhythm but as soon as I hear the words, I'm disgusted."
5,Best Album Of The Year,This is By Far The Best Album of the year. Way better than Jay-Z's new album. Snoop brings back his old style of hip hop in this cd. And probably every song is at least 4 stars even the intro. Get this cd if u want to hear good hip hop and just overall good music
3,best album of the second half of snoop's career,"Snoop Dogg stepped up on this album. But, only the first half of the album is hot, which is better than his previous few and others that followed this one that only had a couple cool songs."
4,The dogg is back,"Blue carpet treatment is my favorite Snoop album since Doggystyle (one of my favorite hip-hop albums of all time).I think snoop really stepped his game up on this one.If you anticipated a doggystyle or deathrow type album you will be dissapointed; however, if you are in the market for a West-Coast Banger you will love it.Favorite track : Round Here"
5,The Blue Carpet is better than the Red,"This album put Snoop back on the map musically in my opinion. His prior CD's after his first initial CD were weak. Thereafter he only gave you a few singles, but this one was really nice. I could play this CD all the way through without skipping a track. Only Snoop could come up with a title so creative. Blue Carpet treatment is better than your typical hollywood red carpet treatment. Blue is cool. Blue is also my favorite color. To title this CD Blue Carpet treatment shows just how smooth Snoop Dogg is. I especially like the track with Stevie Wonder, Nate Dogg, Dr. Dre, and I also love Vato. I was in California when this single was released and they were playing it at every beach. The beats on this CD flows with his smooth voice. Dr. Dre has helped Snoop once again. This is one of Snoop's best CD's in a long time, fo' shizzle my nizzle, you can't beat the Snoop D.O. double gizzle. LOL"
4,Lovely,"delicate, sweet. fun going with a simple & feminine & young dress. But sometimes it's a bit cloying to my nose."
2,"Early Alice Adams book..has promise, but falls flat.","""Families and Survivors"" was Alice Adams's second novel, and it shows. Written in the mid-70s, it shows. The novel follows four couples, but mainly two childhood best friends, and their various love affairs. There is a lot of sex, mostly with the wrong people, as some commit adultery, or sleep with men twice their age. There is also some spouse-swapping(this is a 7os books after all). And the children of the couples also have their stories as well. The characters are not likable, as characters are awfully neurotic. I wanted to like it, and I was ok with its slow pace, but it disappoited me."
2,These curtains are like IKEA furniture compared to Crate and Barrel.,"The quality isn't good for the price. Pay a bit more for better.The only reason I put up with it is:1. The purple color instead of the midnight blue color doesn't make too much of a difference in my dark room2. I don't want to pay for shipping to return the item because it didn't come with a curtain pole. Yes, now that I read it more carefully, it doesn't say it comes with one even though the title has the words in it3. I've got (good) ""history"" with Amazon. It's $30 at [...]4. I had a bed sheet I can use as a liner, since the curtains didn't come with a backing and bleed light as profusely as my temporary hung up bed sheet. (Z gallerie's curtains are on clearance and come with a liner on the back for a couple bucks more. Unfortunately, they didn't have a set of 2)5. It doesn't have to be soft and smooth feeling. It's just to block out sunlight, but I felt a lot of other velvet panels that feel silky"
2,not the nicest curtains,"These curtains are not very well made. There are a few imperfections in the fabric- almost like runs you would get in stockings. They do not seem like real velvet, more like a cross between fake suede and velor. They do a mediocre job of blocking the sun (but they are not advertised as blocking sun)"
5,Warm Feet Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh,A great product for under the desk. 2 heat settings is a good option.Can't live without it now.
4,Much more information than meets the glance,Its handsome period illustrations and subtitle--garden writing from the golden age of magazines--suggest that this is just a charming exercise in nostalgia. Far from the case. These articles offer a great deal of practical gardening information from hands-on gardeners that is often very hard to find. It's particularly helful on gardening with native plants and I find myself consulting it repeatedly.
5,Magical adventure,"One of the best things about this story is that all the magic it contains might be real one day. I'd love a bedroom like Joeys, its really cool. The story really draws you in and gets you involved with the characters. Its great to see a Chinese central character. I really like Kim and the way she and Tycho are always arguing is funny. And I really feel for Diana when the truth about her is revealed. Joey is a good friend when she needs one most. I hope they all go on to have more adventures together."
5,Every boy and his Dad.....,"...need one of these. Knowledge of knots helps in plenty of surprise situations, and it's great fun to learn them together. Works for grandpa, too!"
1,Not Happy,"After I pulled my brains out trying to start my brand new weed eater, it finally fired up. Then I proceeded to attempt to weed eat my yard, which did not end well. As soon as I stuck it to the grass, it bogged down continuously. Not being inclined to make adjustments to a brand new weed eater, I promptly placed it back in the box (after removing the gasoline) and returned it to the store and bought a Husqvarna, which I should have done in the first place~~~Rob D."
1,JUNK!!!!!!,"this trimmer has been hard starting since new. not even a year old,louder than any other trimmer i have owned and when it does start,,it wont stay running when giving it gas.would not recomend.and i am just a home owner that use's it on the week ends only."
3,3 star is all,"I purchased Poulan Pro (ppo25) 4/6/2012, my wife and I put it together, put fuel in it, it took off right away... no problems with it choking (like with the piece of junk Weedeater that we never were able to trim the lawn with) the ppo25 is a powerful trimmer; our most negative opinion on the trimmer is the tiny trimmer line; but it beat the heck out of the short line for the Weedeater that had to be replaced every 10 minutes. We are going to have to buy 2-3 extra trimmer line spools so as not to have to spend time rewinding spools. If you want something to gripe about (seriously), buy a Weedeater trimmer... if you want ""minimal"" gripes, buy the ppo25 and 2-3 spools. Of course ""some people"" would gripe if you hung them with a brand new rope! :-\"
3,"Arrived broken, underwhelmed with performance","I received my Poulan Pro with a crack in the cover to the air filter. I should have sent it back immediately, but I needed to cut weeds and couldn't wait for a replacement. Well, I taped it together, but that didn't last. This led to losing the foam air filter on a windy day (tape came undone, filter got out...). And guess how easy it is to find a replacement filter? NOT easy. Not locally, at least.Anyway, the power was never great. I worry about burning up the engine every time I use it (about an hour at a time). It's not a ""piece of junk,"" but it's nowhere near top of the line. It's more like an entry level gas powered weed whacker. It gets the job done. But every time I use it I wish I had something a little better."
1,Piece of junk!,"I bought this item from the military exchange at a discount. It broke down on the very first time I used it. The disk that delivers the line stopped rotating (so no cutting!) and the line wouldn't come out even though I tapped the disk on a smooth surface as directed (I had to stop the motor and pull out the line manually!). I returned it the same day. This is just another piece of junk!!!!If you want a good weed trimmer, buy a STIHL. They are not discounted but supposedly work well and are serviced by their dealerships. That's what I am going to get."
1,Air Gets in line...Hard to start,I have the same problem as a previous reviewer. Air gets in line and it is VERY difficult to start. You can see bubbles in primer line. Once started it kills and can be difficult to restart. I am going to return this.
2,Defective Poulan Pro String Trimmer,"I ordered two of the Poulan Pro PPO25 17 inch 25cc 2 Cycle Gas Powered Curved Shaft String Trimmers. The first was sent to 1918 Daffodil Dr. Acworth, GA 30102. It was a good product. I ordered one for our use. It arrived with the base all scratched and marred. It was also put together improperly. As it was immediately re-inserted into the box, when we found it to be defective; I tried to return it and get a refund. Amazon.com told me to get rid of it because it couldn't be returned. I am displeased because I received a defective item. I am also displeased because I received a refund with no way to show you that the item is defective. I don't like getting something for nothing.....I'd prefer to return it to you to SHOW you that I'm a trustworthy customer.L. K.Poulan Pro PP025 17 inch 25cc 2 Cycle Gas-Powered Curved-Shaft String Trimmer with Split Shaft"
4,Great Tool For Catching Up On Your Reacing,"I think I like this software more than our 4 year old likes it. I guess that's because it's allowing me to catch up on my reading and watch some of my favorite DVDs. Trust me, once you put this CD-Rom in the computer, your child will stay busy for hours. He or she will be quiet as a church mouse. I also like the fact that our 4 year old also found this CD-Rom very child-friendly. When I attempted to help her she quickly let me know that she did not need any help"
5,Great Green Eggs and Ham!,My 3.5 year old loves this game. It enabled him to master the mouse and now we leave him alone to play at his own pace and length of time. He constantly is calling me or my husband in to see some funny or fascinating tid-bit that is hidden in the picture. The memory game is his favorite and he's up to level 3! I now am looking into getting the Cat in the Hat for him.
4,My niece loves it!,"With a number of different modes that offer different levels of involvement, and a number of interesting games and sounds, it's a joy to watch her enjoy herself and click all around the screen to make the characters say silly things."
5,Great piece of music!,I've had this CD for several years and it makes a regular rotation through my CD player. Clator Butler has a strong voice and is a joy to listen to. His lyrics are thought-provoking and relevant to the times. He also sends a portion of his proceeds to assorted charties. Another great reason to buy!
1,Will not work on Windows XP,I purchased My First Math Adventure from DK Interactive and was very pleased with it. The Reading Explorer will not work on XP. It is very disappointing.
2,Just for Milnes,"Pav's nasal strangulated sound and pushed up high notes are pure agony for me. Freni sounds like an elephant on a tight rope. If you can stand these 2 its worth it for Milnes, the master of acting with the voice (despite the passagio problems attributed to laser cutting of nodes). I heard Milnes in concert and knew what he was singing about even when I didn't know the song or aria. The whole concert was mesmerizing. A master of interpretation.I recommend the La Scala video with Merritt and Zancanaro."
2,Plodding interpretations,"I am sorry to give a less than glowing review of this CD, as I like French piano music, especially impressionistic. I also like duo piano works, and am always game for hearing piano treatments of works one normally hears in orchestra form, such as the Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun. However, the interpretations all seemed plodding to me. I did not check comparative tempi for the works because times can be misleading -- inner dynamics can make a piece exciting even if the time of the recorded piece is on the lengthy side. It seemed almost as if the players were tentative, but that should not be since they have recorded much together before. However, the Milhaud Scaramouche was done well. The Vif was sparkling and playful, the Modere had a nice touching air about it, while the Brasileira moved along well but did not sound quite Brazilian to me. The recorded sound is decent."
4,"Great sound and sturdy, but . . .","Great sound and sturdy, but it is a little larger than I thought it would be and the carrying pouch is only large enough for the speaker, not cables. I was looking for speakers for my iPod for the office and to take to quilting classes. This will work for quilting classes, but not for the office. I run my iPod all day and, because this speaker doesn't include a charger, the iPod runs out of power halfway through the day. I ended up buying a charging speaker system for work."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"My first one of these, purchased Nov. 2006, malfunctioned almost immediately, sending me in U-turns and getting me lost when it suddenly shut off while navigating.My replacement was a brand new one sent by Magellan in Dec. 2006. It worked well for a short period of time before getting stuck in gps tracking and then giving me the wrong names of roads I was travelling.I've tried in vain to get a refund (spent over 2 hours calling Magellan and being disconnected when I asked to speak with someone to get my money back). I've spoken to 6 different customer service reps, all who promised I'd get a call back from one of their constantly-too-busy-for-me supervisors. You guessed it----no calls back!I'm stuck with this lousy GPS and Magellan has no interest in helping me. Stay AWAY FROM MAGELLAN!"
5,A magical mystery tour of a fairy-tale future,"When the world's last surviving forest begins to fight back against its exterminators, a motley band of Crusaders sets out to find out why...but that's just the beginning.Although set in the future, Rumors of Spring is more fairy tale than science fiction. Richard Grant has woven the elements of fantasy, satire and mythology into a beautiful dreamscape populated by characters as complex and true-to-life as our closest friends--that is, if our friends lived in a world where owls could talk and little boys lived five hundred years.By the time you've finished this book, you'll want to live there, too."
2,An Ugly Zen Book,"This book consists of the beautiful and profound Genjokoan essay by Dogen Zenji, which takes up about ten pages in nice calligraphy. Then there is a vapid commentary on it by Rev. Maezumi, who is not up to the task. This is accompanied by pages and pages of amateurish, muddy, and thoroughly dated photographs (from the 70's) of puddles, pieces of grass, cement walls, various broken stuff, etc. Be grateful this book is out of print."
1,Description misleading,This was advertised as a 5 piece set - what actually arrived was a two piece set. It was for a gift so I did not have time to get it corrected and had to settle for what was shipped. Either the product was wrong or the description was wrong. Please fix.
2,Shipping Rates,"An appealing tire, but once I calculated in the shipping rates it was a lot more expensive than it appeared and I sourced it locally for less. Don't be deceived, the per shipment and per pound charges are reasonable, but the tire is officially ""5 pounds,"" making the shipping $8 for two tires instead of the $4 you might think, and it goes up by $2.50 per tire."
3,Surprised,"I think if you need a gluten free diet this bar is for you. But if you can eat wheat, I prefer Zone Bars (Mint) better. I bought these after all of the good reviews but when I ate it-it didn't taste like white chocolate at all and the texture is a little gross (sorry). It also is good for fighting hunger, but so are Zone Bars so I think I will stick with them."
1,Really unpleasant flavor and texture,"I am not a picky eater and generally like most of the meal replacement and snack bars that I've tried, but these had a really unpleasant taste at the end, and the texture was not good either. Unfortunately, I now have a box with 9 remaining bars that I would not eat under any circumstances."
2,There are better flavors,This is my least favorite of these bars. The white coating is dry and way too sweet. Stick with the peanut butter and chocolate varieties.
2,Disappointing,"Might look tasty but lacks even a touch of white chocolate flavor. Maybe the other flavors are better, but definitely steer clear of this - not worth anything near $1+ a bar."
3,Good but could be better,"Delivery was fast, flavor is good. Being sugar free is a big plus for me, but the center is not white and I found no chips !The White is a very thin layer on the outside.Still good but no quite what I expected"
4,"Zero sugar, great taste","I love this bar--BUT bear in mind that I have to try hard to find a zero-sugar food that's easy to grab and throw in my purse. If you're just looking for something yummy, this may not be your favorite. But if you're looking for zero sugar, it's almost impossible to find, and when you do find it, it usually tastes bad. In fact, there are some chocolate or chocolate/peanut butter versions of this same product, and I HATE them. Gross. But the white chocolate tastes great. Caveat: They are 230 calories per bar, which is too many calories for me, so I cut them in half and keep each half in a ziploc bag in my cupboard for a quick grab when I'm running out the door. Then we're down to only 215 calories, but still filling. I love this bar."
2,Found these really tasteless,This product sounded great. I ordered a box and really could only eat one. I took the box into work and found that my opinion was shared. They just tasted empty of flavor. very disappointing.
2,low carb?,"can someone please tell me how the ""four net carbs"" on the amazon header page (before you buy it) translates into the 28 carbs on the outside of the box per bar once it arrives? Are we being lied to?"
4,Pretty good!,"I like the Think Thin bars for their nutritional profile, not so much for their taste. I've tried the brownie and the dark chocolate and sometimes have to swallow hard to get them down, along with some kind of beverage. When these arrived the first thing I noticed was how soft and chewy and ""fresh"" they tasted- in comparison to the others which are very firm, if not hard, bars. Wow. That makes all the difference. These went down like a dream, and while I'm not going to say you will love them like a Snickers, I will say that they don't taste bad at all and chew like a warm oatmeal cookie. I am beginning to wonder if it is just this flavor which is so soft and tasty, or if my other bars are just old and hard. All bought on Amazon, though. In any case, they were MUCH better than expected!"
3,Not the best,There is something about this protein bar that does not sit well with me. I think its the white chocolate. I know its not real white chocolate but it still doesn't appeal to me. I tried it on a whim while traveling and probably won't have it again. I'm more of a fan of the peanut butter variety. However my friend really enjoyed this one.
5,Good and good for you,"I like all the products I have bought from this company. They have good flavor, nice constancy, not too sweet, flavorful and are filling. Company offers a nice variety."
5,Think Thin,"Think Thin is a great meal replacment, not to sweet but sweet enough to stop your cravings."
4,Think thin bar,The flavor wasn't as great as I thought they should be when the person I bought them for gave them back.
1,Worst protein bar ever tasted!,"Other reviewers here that gave this bar a good review must have been paid off by thinkthin. Theses are the worst tasting protein bars I've ever tasted in my life. At least other brands try to make their bar taste alright, thinkthin basically said nope, not even going to try. The bar barely has any white chocolate taste to it. The bar is bitter and dry. It took me 30 minutes to finish 1 bar because it tasted so bad. Will never buy another thinkthin product."
1,LIES!!,"I HATE chocolate, but love white chocolate. Imagine how pissed I was to open and find normal chocolate brown color and flavor inside. NO white chocolate except a teeny tiny thin layer on the outside. Doesn't look a bit like the pic. either. YUCK and YUCK again!!!!"
3,ThinkThin White Chocolate: totally inert,"It's like some pleasantly-textured packing material. NO TASTE WHATSOEVER. Completely inert, like drinking distilled water. This could be a good thing, like when I know I have to eat something to avoid getting a headache. Would I think of reaching for this bar again? No. It doesn't taste anything like white chocolate. Or anything else. If I was on a space flight or something this might be a delicacy. Here on Earth? If I'm going to indulge in a prepared food type of treat like this, I'd rather it have some flavor, even at the expense of having calories or fat content. The lack of flavor in this bar impressed me. Obviously the company put time and effort into developing this bar along with their others. Did no one notice that this thing had zero flavor??"
3,Taste good but high in carbs,This bar tastes good but I was disappointed to see that it has 25g carbs and isn't good for a low-carb diet. It does contains 20g protein. I will go back to my more expensive Atkins High Protein bar.
3,Just okay...,"Sickeningly sweet, and I'm not a fan of the fact that it contains soy protein isolate. It's convenient on the go, but a bit too high carb for my usual low-carb diet."
3,Edible,"I read the other reviews and thought I would give this protein bar a try. My taste buds must not be like the reviewers who liked this bar. It was edible at best. It has a smooth filling with an artificial taste and after taste. As one who started a weight watching quest with Tab in the early '60's (bad, bad after taste that still lingers 50 years later) I am willing to try a product on others recommendations. This one, though it has 20 grams of protein, is not worth a rebuy. As I watch what I eat and look for low carb, high protein snacks, calories weren't key in this purchase. If you want high protein and great taste, try the Questbar. It's like a rice crispy treat made from nuts. thinkThin does make a very nice product in their thinkThin crunch bars. I ordered the white chocolate dipped mixed nuts, and will keep on buying them. I think they are crunchy and tasty."
5,For the macros what do you expect,"I had tried this bar before so I knew I liked it. Honestly White Chocolate is the best flavor. I received a fresh shipment from amazon and there was no doubt whether they were good quality or not. This bar is a chocolate nougat with a white chocolate coating. I personally don't find a chemical after taste but I usually eat sugar free products or usually eat food sans sugar, so be forewarned. If you prefer a sugar free taste then you are in for a treat because they are the closest you can get to a candy bar with zero sugar and 20g of protein."
2,Terrible taste,"I noticed that some people said that eating one was enough, but that's probably because of the taste. I've tried two other flavors of it before, one was chocolate, and I never liked them at all. I don't understand why some people say that it tastes like a candy bar, it looks really pretty, but then when you actually it bite into, it's terrible, b/c it's all mushy inside. Maybe buy one to try it, but don't buy in bulk unless you're sure you like it"
3,"24"" MK 3 phase Diamond Saw","The saw it self is probably just fine but they shipped a 20"" not a 24"". There was to be a blade included but no blade. The shipping company claimed there was no such phone number, but I phoned them several times from that number.The people at amazon suggested I figure out what parts I need to convert the saw to a 24"", buy them, then they will pay me back. I was the one who had to figure out the parts but MK would not sell them to me, so Amazon must order them. I have had the saw for two weeks now and no parts or idea when they will arrive. The saw looks great but is of no use to me if I don't get my correct parts."
3,Good ~n~ Heavy,"Certainly not doing anything different but this cd is just enough for me to give it a decent rating. I enjoyed listening to the whole album all the way through, not a single song thats lacking here. The only thing that I have to gripe about is how much these guys remind me of 100 Demons. It seems like this is a lost album from 100 Demons. I really like the vocalist and his different approach to delivery. He doesn't go straight with the spoken word growling he actually throws a little bit of yelling and harmony in too. Surprising! This album isn't going to turn the hardcore world on its head by an means but it is certainly an album worth checking out if you like stuff like 100 Demons, Hatebreed, Throwdown, etc."
4,You see?,"Im glad i've read this book, even though i'm aware of the rights of us muslim women. It makes everything clearer to me and to other people."
1,Not the actual film soundtrack,"I have been looking for the soundtrack to Calamity Jane for years and was so excited to find this one. But I was so disappointed that it's not actually the film's soundtrack. ""Deadwood Stage"" sounds like it was recorded straight from the movie, but it is missing an entire portion in the middle of the song. My favorite songs ""Windy City"", ""Black Hills of Dakota"", and ""Woman's Touch"" are all studio re-recordings by Doris -- not the actual versions from the film. ""Windy City"" includes lyrics not used at all in the movie. ""Black Hill"" and ""Touch"" don't include her duet partners. Doris didn't even sing ""It's Harry I'm Plannin' to Marry"" in the film at all, yet, here she is singing it.What a waste and disappointment. I could have saved money and just recorded them myself straight off my DVD of the film."
4,Great Speaker Cable but poor Pins,The 16 Gauge Speaker Cable is a great cable that is protected and shielded well however the Pins that come with it are very cheep and almost pointless to use. I gave it a 4 star because I really like the speaker cable. If you are buying it to be able to use the Pins i would advise to just get the cable and look elsewhere for the Pins.
3,"The cable is ivory in color, not white or off-white","As the title says, this cable is not white - nor an off-white. Its what would normally be called ""ivory"". Its technically a shade of white, but its a dark shade, and looks nothing like the picture. If you are counting on this cable to be white - you will be dissapointed."
1,Prefab Home,I am not happy with the purchase. It is a chronical of his journey in doing a Prefab home. Not much else. Not much help in my understanding the overall pluses and minuses of going the prefab direction and what is available.
4,Good...,"This book is good and it contains almost all the concepts of this area published till the date of the publication of this book. I would mainly like to comment Mahabala, the first reviewer of this book. He was my Ph.D. guide in IIT Madras. I spent eight years with him and at the end he simply sent me out without allowing me to submit the thesis (Another Professor Khemani helped him in this). Please please do not believe Prof. Mahabala's words. He does not know any thing in modern computer science but he speakes as if he knows every thing. May be he is feeling that he is eligible for receiving Turing award!!!He always worried how to get admission for his daughter's (who got MCA degree in India) MS admission in the University of Maryland. Of course finally he managed.I hate this Mahabla and his comments. The best filed for him is Indian politics and I am sure he will shine as a politician in India!!!"
4,Syntax of NT Greek is Good Summary Referenc,"I found that this book does a great job of summarizing grammer elements in a short but pithy fashion. Its treatment of participles was worth the price alone. Normal grammer texts provide a more detailed treatment, but in a less organized, less susinct, and less memorable fashion."
3,Fun and light,"This was a fun read for summer after a couple serious dramas. Even though there was a list of ""characters"" at the beginning, it was still hard to keep track of all the comings and goings of the various animals. Now I understand some of the rural homes I pass with a variety of animals all over the yard."
5,Enslaved by Ducks,"I think this book is a hoot. Anyone that's had animals or birds (I have both) know what loving, exasperating, fun additons they can be to any home. I can relate very well to this book."
4,a good weekend read,A neurotic guy who marries an animal-loving woman and watch how the animals change his life. I love stories like that. Makes me wish I had land and lots of time.
4,"Fun, Honest","Fun, fun fun! Best way to describe this. Tarte's descriptions are just so much fun. He slips words/phrases in that you aren't expecting. For example, when describing a friend's dog he says ""a labrador retriever/american bison hybrid"" and just keeps on going. If you are an animal lover - an animal LIKER - you will enjoy this book. It is a fast read. Tarte has an honest voice. He pokes fun at himself, his wife, and their friends. After I read this, I looked at my own 2 cats and thanked my lucky stars that they are so good and get along so well. Well, for cats.........."
1,enslaved by this book,I found this book very lack luster and hard to get into. I was looking forward to a funny and entertaining read but did not find it in this book
3,"a bi t ditzy, but...","Mr Tarte does not fail to do and say all the usual ""new to the country"" things...and animals...he falls for them all, reluctantly, but fully!"
3,"Liked it, but enough with the birds","The first third of the book, I laughed out loud several times. A very engaging writer. I love animals, but am not much on birds. So about halfway through the book, I pretty much had my fill of our feathered friends."
