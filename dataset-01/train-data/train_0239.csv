1,"Really, it's crappy","I even hesitate to give this product one star. The wheel is so loud, you can hear it in the lower level of our home. That being said, anyone sleeping in the same room will never sleep soundly again.Also, while the wheel spins around, it flings poop out of the cage in a three foot radius. The employees of CritterTrail that work in Research and Design should be fired immediately. How can you let a product be sold that doesn't hold critter crap?Other designs by CritterTrail are much better, just don't be fooled by the cool look of this Wheel of Misfortune."
2,My review,"Well I would not recommend this cage to people that have cats. My hamsters name is Chloe she was in her cage one night. My bedroom door was open, so my cat jumped on the table and knocked down this cage and this cage broke. So my cat took my hamster. Then I took my hamster out of my cats mouth. Luckily she did not die or get hurt too bad she got two cuts. so if you have cats I would not recommend this cage."
2,Don't like it....,"We haven't had good luck with this cage at all. We have a dwarf hamster in it. The cage doesn't stay together well at all, I have it taped in places. We still lost her for a day when she climbed the wall, pushed up the top, and got out. When I try to take pieces off to wash them, everything falls apart. Like other people have said, she pees and poos in the wheel, but we have found the tray underneath doesn't catch it all so we end up with a bigger mess. We DO love the petting zone though, it's a great way to catch her.The hamster gives the cage 5 stars, we don't."
2,Flimsy,This is a good product for a little bit but for long term use it stinks. Poop and pee comes through the cracks in the wheel and the cage is very flimsy. It falls apart very easly. If you don't plan on moving the cage it is great but if you plan on moving the cage around or even cleaning it than it stinks. Every time I move the cage it falls apart and than I have to put it back together again. Spend your money a different cage because you will be wasting it on this one.
5,Don't forget the book!,"The Adventures of Ociee Nash is a warm, wonderful movie for family entertainment. Boys and girls will thoroughly enjoy this beautifully directed and produced film. Parents will be glad that there is a child-friendly movie that they can watch with their kids.Ociee Nash is a precocious child who survives life's most traumatic event with adventure, fun, and optimism.And don't forget to read the book that this film is based on by Milam Propst: A Flower Blooms on Charlotte Street (and its sequel, Ociee on Her Own).The McGary Sisters directed and produced their screen adaptation. Their love of this film shows on every frame.Note: I saw the movie when it was released in select theaters."
5,"The Orishas, not just for Santeros anymore","One of the most intriguing aspects of Witchcraft and Wicca is that one can work with any group of deities that she sees fit. However African-Americans Witches are hard pressed to find material written about the West African godforms known as the Orishas.This book fits the bill perfectly. Although written from the viewpoint of Santeria, this book makes the Orishas accessible and comphrensible to followers of Wicca.Information is broken into modules which present the attributes of each Orisha such as elemental rulerships, personality traits and temperments, ""job"" descriptions, day, color and herbal associations.Admittedly, Wiccans don't work with the Orishas in the same context as the followers of Santeria or it's parent religion Ifa but experienced Witches will have no trouble incorporating the information presented here into their religious and magickal practice.Afterall It IS Yemaya who is ""Queen of Witches""."
3,Very helpful text,"If you're interested in Santeria, and perhaps Voudou and related traditions, this is an enormously helpful reference book.Each of the Orishas is listed with corresponding Catholic saints (and their detailed histories and feast days), colors, days of the week, offerings, necklaces, and more. You'll also find a few basic rituals for purposes related to each Orisha.For anyone looking for a broad view of religious beliefs and practices, and how they connect, universally, this is essential reading.This is an important addition to your library, for information that is unique, easy-to-use, and adds substance to the mysteries of Afro-Caribbean traditions."
4,"Great book for beginners, but read something else first.","This book is a great primer for knowledge of the Orishas, but it's better if you've already been introduced to them. I recommend reading another book about the Religion before reading this. This is a great guidebook on the Orishas to always have when it's time to do ebbo, adimu, or a feast day."
2,"deleted scenes excellent,the rest sucks","the deleted scenes were a huge improvement over the original counterstrike.why couldn't they make the rest of the game like that?in the online version, or regular single or multiplayer mode,the characters move like robots.very fake-like.when you shoot them, they do the same stupid thing,hang there for a minute and fall down.the original version is much more lifelike,the reason i loved this game in the first place.plus there is no way to search for a local sever in ""steam"". so you can't play on a computer to computer network.had high expectations and was really let down."
3,"Better graphics, SSDD","This is just the same boring multi-player 1PS that it always has been, with better graphics. Most of the maps used are vintage plain old CS."
1,Bad Business,"Many of us are very upset that the December 30th release did not hold true. The truth is, Sierra/Valuesoft never had any intention of release CS:CZ on that date. Once they missed the Sept. and Nov. release dates, they new it would take until March to get everything complete. The only reason they named Dec. 30th was so that they could maximize pre-orders for Christmas. If they had designated March 30th as the release date a few months ago, they would have had far fewer pre-orders leading up to the end of the year. This helps them pad their 2003 financials. Such practices should be a crime. I urge everyone to cancel their pre-orders and, if you decide you still want to purchase, wait until March 25th approaches to pre-order it."
2,Ripped Off,Don't bother buying this game if you have the original CS. It's the same thing with slightly better graphics. With all the hype and delays it should have been better. For Shame Sierra... For Shame.Wait for the price to drop to $10... Then consider it.
1,I made a $25 mistake,"I regret buying HL:CS-CZ; That was one of the biggest mistakes I've made with my money. It's one thing to spend $25 on your girlfriend and she dumps you the next day, but this is like she's dumping you 30 seconds after buying it.CZ and CS 1.6 has destroyed the true CS community, sure there are some seasoned people around but other than that it is all noobs.Lame excuse for LAN games, you must be connected to steam and the internet to play a LAN game. Lousy objectives on the bot SP, Deleted Scenes is ok but it's exactly like HL or HL:OPFOR.Bad Valve===escaping STEAMThe balance of the game was taken out in cs 1.1-1.3 (I'm old school CS, Beta 4-CS1.6)"
3,Read About it,"What people dont realize about this game is that it is single player only- granted, a new multiplayer update 1.6 is being released at roughly the same time, but this involves only a few of the additions of CS:CZ and some ones not found in the single player. If youre going to rag on this game because of the multiplayer, or saying that you dont want the multiplayer changed, know what youre talking about first. Plus, there should never have been 80 damn reviews on it when its not going to come out for another half of a year (supposedly)."
3,Continuous delay of releasing CZ,One starts wondering if such a marketing strategy by delaying the release date merely is an effort to compensate for the quality of the game. Such a high praised game should speak for itself and draw plenty of sales once released. What a dissappointment if this continuing postponing goes on.
1,How can you rate this game?,"This game hasnt been released and yet you can still rate it? If this game is anything like the original Counter-Strike (I guess we can call it this now) on its limited and outdated engine then I would not expect a huge difference. All I could expect are some bug fixes, new maps and models. Single player sounds cool but I do think that the multiplayer aspect will be overrun with cheaters like the original counter-strike because the valve does nothing about cheaters."
5,WoW BEST GRAPHICS OF ALL TIME. SUPER ACTION,When I first got the game I opened it up.I was on it for HOURS.I STRONGLY RECCOMEND AT LEAST A 56K GAME CARD.IF YOU LIKE ACTION GAMES YOU WILL ENJOY IT.The AI is so interactive. Real lifelike animation (especially the fire).
3,About Counter-Strike:Condition Zero,"Is this game coming out or what they have moved the due date back so much it was december 30, 2003 now its moved all the way back to March i hope it comes out some time soon and add more features if there's no new guns i heard there's updated maps like de_dust de_aztec."
2,>>>>>????????>>>>>>>,GRaphics still[bad] quake 2 enginestop adding on and make a whole new Counter-Strike on a better engine.Still fun and u can shoot through stuff so i give 2 stars
3,Old,"This game has amazing single-player with bots that are smarter than any other online members, however, it lacks new features. The only difference from CSZ and CS 1.6 is the fact that the maps are tweaked and the player models look a bit better. If you have an internet connection, and you are satisfied with regular counter-strike, keep it. If you have counter-strike and your internet sucks, download bots such as ShrikeBOT or PodBot. If your internet sucks so bad you can't even download a 500 KB file that contains the bot data, get CSZero, or just buy another game."
5,A Certain Game Of The Year Award,"I have been playing counter-strike for well over 4 years now and I cant remeber a time when I got bored of it. To say the least its the best game I have ever owned. If Condition-zero is anything like it, it's sure to when a game of the year award and is next on my list of games to buy. Plus, now with the single player mode, even people with slow dial up internet can enjoy cs:cz through the thrilling AI opponents. This has been long awaited and is sure to hold up to everyones expectations. I cant wait to have a condition zero icon on my desktop."
1,COUNTER-STRIKE: CONDITION ZERO,PURCHASED THROUGH AMAZON..APPARENTLY I BOUGHT IT THROUGH AN OUTSIDE PERSON...GAME DID NOT WORK ON MY COMPUTER...SENT IT BACK TO THE PERSON I PURCHASED IT FROM..HE SAID IT WORKED OK ON HIS END AND SENT THE GAME BACK TO ME...I WANT A REFUND AND HE AND AMAZON WILL NOT CREDIT MY ACCOUNT...SO I HAVE 2 VERY UNHAPPY GRANDKIDS AND A GAME THAT IS UNUSABLE. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND WILL ONLY ORDER KINDLE PRODUCTS FROM NOW ON.
5,awsome,i love counter strike i love counter strike i love counter strike i love counter strike i love counter strike i love counter strike
2,Laaaaaaame,"In hindsight, I don't know why I was so amped about this coming out. The deleted scenes component is buggy and not very challenging or exciting. I could have beaten the game in a day if it hadn't crashed on me every hour and a half. As for the single player CS mode where you team up with bots, that is somewhat fun and interesting and the only reason why this review gets two stars... but after a couple of rounds you realize you'd rather play with real people instead of bots who do the same thing over and over again. I'd rather play regular CS or perhaps work on Day of Defeat somemore. This company needs to put more time into creating something worth buying, not just a rehash of BAD games that came before it."
3,its...ok,"i heard of counterstrike a while ago and it sounded like a fun shooter, especially online. I bought the newest one, condition zero, in the hopes of having a game like Tom Clancy's Raven Shield or similiar. Big mistake. The grafics look like the game is from 1995, I could not believe that the makers of the game dared giving grafics so awful. The single player missions lack logic and team cooperation. What also surprised me was that there are so little weapons to choose from and you get about 3 seconds to buy one before getting shot. Maybe this it only because I have been spoiled by the 57 real world weapons you can choose from in Raven Shield. The game is fun on lan parties though, if you ignore the grafics. Thats why I'm giving it 4 stars for fun."
1,Why bother?,"No new game play. No new guns. Some new maps and skins, but there are a plethora of these on the web anyway.Stick to CS 1.6."
1,"Valve makes buggy software, rampant cheating possible",Counter-Strike was a very nice mod for Half-Life until the cheating became rampant. These days all it takes is a simple download and you can watch everybody else staring at you through walls. Neither Valve nor Sierra will address these problems and both ignore requests to fix them.Do not buy this game for the multiplayer capabilities as these companies have a poor track record.
3,I hopeeee.......................,"I have been playing this game about 3 years, now i'm tired of it not of game of stupid hackers who can kill in head just press button see thru walls where all people sit highest score have person who have more hacks installed isn't it stupid? i hope CS:CZ will be not hacked like all this old CSs versionsI hopeeeeeeeee................."
1,Jarrod and Phoenix - Hush Up And Listen,"Jarrod, the Anti-Cheat System will be bypassed. They always are. Remember how Diablo II was supposedly unhackable? Look at it now. Don't get yourTo Phoenix, In was playing since the early beta stages, so don't call me a n00b. Everybody here has been saying THIS IS THE BEST GAME!! GO BUY IT!! It's not even out yet, so that's a good enough reason for me to give 1 star. So please STFU."
1,adam aka matix is right,start making other video games that arent army make things of swat teams navy seals police for theres a whol new world out there people are getting tired of counter strike and im giving 50 thumps up to battle feild 1942 sierra/valve/gearbox make something of the iraqi war i would love that sssoooooooooooooo much that would be cool and if you did have a create a solder were you can edit a character for 1 player mode have it on playstation 2 + xbox have 1 player mode and online mode for people withxbox live or ps2 net adapter you could be rich with that and make the best graphics you can make by the way my name is lee freeman i have reveiws on lots of stuff please make the iraq war thing and call it operation iraqi freedom and you have to do every thing they did on 1 player and online just things like capture the flag or team deathmatch and death match each employee would be so rich who wouldnt agree with me.
2,Nothing new...,"I thought the bots were supposed to be intellegent? I have watched both T and CT stand looking at each other for a few seconds before firing. Also, mostly your guys get in your way or kill the hostages if a T is in line with one. If this is as good as it gets, then cancel my HL2 order."
5,Does it work with XP,"There are alot of people on these posts that think that this game is not going to function with Windows XP... Counter Strike runs on XP, so why would they make CZ not compatible with XP... Don't be silly guys.... This game is going to be the bomb!!! My only complaint is why have they pushed it back so many times.... Release it already!!! But with the delays maybe there won't be so many issues to work through..."
1,Screwed By Liars and Did Not Get Kissed,"It is a sad day when a business (the game developer) lies to its distribution network and the public for the all holy bottom line, year end sales numbers. Also alienated by your greed are the thousands of individuals who anticipated an exceptional game for Christmas or a birthday gift. How about Amazon or Sierra paying interest on the use of our money from date of purchase to the delivery date. Do we really believe that the March date is good, or will it be December 30,2004 (or2005). If this was my company I would have people working overtime to meet a commitment to my customers. Remember, with out customers you do not have a sale. Come on Sierra and Amazon be honest and do the right thing."
2,For offline or new players only,"I've been waiting years for Condition Zero(CZ) to come out but now that it's out, it's to little to late. CZ is extremely dissapointing for a hard core CS veteran like myself. The meat of CS has and always will be multiplayer and CZ adds nothing new other than updated graphics. The singleplayer aspect of CZ is mediocre compared to games like Call of Duty and Far Cry. Too add to the disspapointment CZ comes out a week after UT2004 and Battlefield Vietnam which are both superb multiplayer games.Good+ Intelligent Bots+ Updated GraphicsBad- Same old CS gameplay.- Mediocre single player.- Adds NOTHING new to multiplayer."
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE COUNTER-STRIKE,Condition zero is the same as COUNTER-STRIKE that has ben out for a long time.same maps with same new onessame skinssame guns
2,Save your bucks for a better game,"I got CS: CZ with some degree of trepidation because I had the sneaking suspicion that it would really suck. Guess what, it does. There are not enough changes to the game to warrant paying $40 bucks for a repackaging of the multiplayer game that has been out for a long time. Very few new additions to the game, the new textures look worse than the old textures! Most of the levels are reused levels from the original multiplayer game. The only significant addition to the game is bots, which are actually pretty good(hmm, 3 years to add some good bots to an already great game??). So, if your internet connection is very good and you can't play Counterstrike on the internet, get this game. Otherwise, there are much better single player games out there such as Halo and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell."
2,this game is wierd...,well i am a mega cs fan i play cs and i am quit good at it but this game has a bad name for cs. i mean you know deleted scenes was great with the nice skins and stuff but the rest sucks. i mean when i try to go online in steam my computer crashes and freezes. and the menu is laggy. and trust me i have a good computer so you do the math. i think the regualer cs is better dont waste your money on this buy like te regular cs and play it from there but not here or by a good computer game like halo or unreal tournament 2k4
5,i love this game.,when is the game is out in sinagpore.i am from singapore and i love to buy your counter-strike:condition zero. Eamil me to tell me when isthe game coming . plz reply as fast as u can.
1,"People, The Game Isn't Even Out Yet",Don't mistake the one star as a bad game. I'm simply saying that you can't go ahead and call this game of the year considering it's not even out yet. Remember Daikatana? That game was supposedly set to rule the world but then turned into [stuff]. Don't be so hasty with your words.
1,Delayed Again..,"I've been doing alot of research on CZ, and it seems to me the game just won't be worth it if it EVER gets released. The screenshots availible on Amazon are that of the Ritual studios version which have been 86'ed. Turtle Rock studios have taken over the project because the Ritual version just plain sucked. This is the game that had been leaked, for all those writing saying they've played it. The Turtle Rock version will be different, however, all CZ will be in the long run is CS with bots. Thats all. As for the ""missions"" all I""ve heard is that it will be a la Tony Hawk style i.e. 5 headshots with a deagle, 5 headshots with the dualies...ect. No new skins, no new weapons, just new maps and re-textured old maps. Anyway, the game will tank, and I'll pick it up when it reaches the bargain bin for $9.99"
2,Buy Something Else,"Graphics S-U-C-K. Multiplayer engine, Steam, has more security flaws than you should ever want, and I am sick of having to reregister with them."
2,Counter-Strike.... OUtdated,"CS is so outdated, the graphics aren't really that much of an improvement from the original, and who would pay ...for it when you can download the old one (which is basically the same as this one...) for free! Dont waste your money on this, ..."
3,Tired fan,"i have owned the first counter-strike for almost four years now, and i still play it almost every other day. condition-zero looks amazing, the single player mode sounds great and the online co-op mode will be even better. the only thing that is pissing me off is that this game was supposed to come out over a year ago, and it still isnt out. this could be a good thing(more work into it) or it could just be they are having alot of problems. whatever it is when it comes out(if it does) it should be a great buy, but for now buy Half Life: Counter-Strike, the best multiplayer game ever made"
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this a year ahead of time expecting something more like HL. I was very disappointed with the ""Match"" format, the dash and shoot to a time schedule thing. I played it for a while the first day I got it and put it away in disgust. Call of Duty called me back."
5,System Requirements---READ THIS,"First of all, Counter Strike is most certainly one of the best games out there. The action is continuous and the reply value is superb. However, if you have a Pentium III do not buy this item. I've got a III at 1 GHz and it's simply not fast enough to run this game. I'm not talking about a little bit of lag during online play. I'm talking about conditions like a continuous lag spike of over 4000 the entire time you play. (If you play counter strike, you know how impossible these conditions are.) Therefore, this game is impossible to play if you don't have a P IV. Just keep this in mind before you purchase."
4,same old but better,"this is basically 1.6 smoothed out with bots(which are better & more human like in thier actions than i thought they would be)at first the bots have a pause before they shoot,so i figure this game sucks.other than the multi player maps are better.but as i get farther along this is getting better .the ""condition zero:deleted sceens "" is cool too.its a story line single player just kill kill kill easy.if you suck a cs this is great practice to improve your game.if your already good its worth it just to see what they've done to your favorite maps & check out the new ones.if you never played cs get it.it rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Told 2 U By Da|2k-|3oNeZ :;LISTEN 2 THIS VERY CAREFULLY;:,"Ok i have done a review already and im gonna do another 1. Cs : Cz is not a multiplayer or online version of Cs. It is a single-player campaign like game. If ne Cs gamers play the New cs 1.6 with all new guns such as the Galil , Fumar , and more. Plz go look for the cs steam beta patch 2.0. And follow all of the instructions for a full version of Cz. It is out now!! i just dled it 2day. Even if a site says its not out yet there wrong! it has been out since last november. Thank U From Da|2k |3oNeZ"
5,lets hope it will be a great game,"When i came to play cs for the first time i was amazed on how great of a game it is. I know many people disagree with me because its not a complete counter terrorism game, it has its flaws. CS dosent have all the great skins or weapons that a game, lets say Ghost Recon has, its also not as realistic. But for some reason theres people up all night playing the game. People all around the world who have been enjoying it since its arival. All i have to say that if CS can draw so many experienced players of other hardcore pc games, Condition Zero will 10x that. As i say in the title lets hope it will be a great game. From what i've read it seems that valve and sierra have put great and extensive time into this game. I recommend anybody who comes across it when it FINALLY comes out to try it out."
3,Go to the Source!,This game is little more than a graphical upgrade to the original Counter-Strike. Compound this with the fact that Counter-Strike: Source (Counter Strike with the Half-Life 2 engine) is now available as a part of Half-Life 2 makes this a pointless upgrade.
4,The Chorus Master Hits It Big Again,"When I first heard that Nate Dogg would be releasing a solo album, I was really excited. I knew that Nate would be accompanied by different artists and make it sound like any normal song that he would be on. But what I liked was he brought in all the artists he worked with in the past couple years. ""I Got Love"", the first single, was definitely banging. I really enjoyed the flute licks presented on that track. ""I Pledge Allegiance"" had a very creative hook and a stylish and well put together flow from Pharoahe Monch. ""Your Wife"" was hot too with production and vocals from Dr. Dre. ""Real Pimp"" kept me tuned and cracked me up with a few comical rhymes spat by Ludacris. ""Keep It G.A.N.G.S.T.A."" really sounded like a club favorite on the album as well with sweet singing from Lil' Mo and West-Coast words from Xzibit. Overall, Music & Me played through without a missing a beat. Nate Dogg has shown he can stay in the game a few ways now"
4,give it a chance,"I was amazed at how different this cd was from G-Funk and at first I didnt like it. After a couple times listening its addictive. I like the guest appearances even though a lot of people think that it is too much. I loved hearing Pharoahes, verse J.D., Fabolous, Dre and who is B.R.E.T.T. but I liked his voice. This is not G-Funk but give it a chance its really good"
3,"Keep It GANGSTA?? Yeah, right........","Nate Doggy Dogg brings some sidekick action in 2000 and 2001. The game plan is on schedule. Now it's time to release his sophomore album. However, he suffers too much with the mainstream. Stripping away his ghetto themes, Nate embrases light subjects with light beats. Album jumps at times with the untouchable ""Music & Me""- an old school Nate Dogg style with some old school G-Funk tune. More credit is given for taking the mike more on the solo compared to G-Funk Classics 1 & 2. Overall though, Nate still suffers with a lacking cameo list. Ludicrous? Fabulous? Pharoah who??? These jiggas need to get bigga. They clearly aren't welcome to the G-Funk cavi albums. Overall dissapointing but hey, atleast he brought us another album."
3,"Fire up the CD burner, don't buy it.....","Find someone like me that blew 14 bucks on it and have them burn it for you. It is worth having, but only if you can get it for free or dirt cheap. It has about 5 tracks worth hearing on it. The first cut, the cut with Snoop, the title cut and #10 which is produced by Battlecat are worth hearing. Some others are respectable. The cut with Dre is weak, the cut with Lil Mo and Xzibit is a waste of time, and finally, the remix at the end with Fabulous and Kurupt is complete garbage. This is coming from a lifetime Eastside Long Beach boy, and extremely biased Nate supporter. (...)"
3,3.5 - fairly solid laid back album,"On his sophomore release, Nate Dogg puts forth a plethora of smooth funked-up tracks, many of which are executed nicely, with a few bumps along the way.What ""Music & Me"" suffers from is an overabundance of guest appearances, some of which dont serve any purpose at all other than to have the name listed on the album and attract that artists fan base to buy it. The album would've been much better with a majority of solo tracks rather than collaborations.The production on the album isnt bad, but some tracks come off bland. Also, Nate doesnt give all his effort on a few lackluster tracks, which really hurt the overall feel of the album.""Music & Me"" lacks the diversity and great solo tracks that ""G-Funk Classics,"" his first solo, had in abundance. But its still a good album if you're a fan of his sound, or you're just lookin for music to kick back to."
4,Music and Me,"No suprises here. Almost everyone who has been blowing up the radio with a little help from Nate Dogg appears on this album. Snoop, Dre, Fabolous, Ludacris, Xzibit, and even Pharoahe Monch all drop verses over some West Coast funk. Some of the collaborations work, some don't. Fabolous and Ludacris add little along with the unsupringly weak JD and a uninspired Snoop Dogg. But Kurupt, Xzibit, and Pharoahe Monch all drop their trademark tight verses with fantastic results on three of the record's best tracks. As a matter of fact with all the guests, Nate Dogg has only three real ""solo"" songs on the whole LP, most succesfully the lead single ""I Got Love"" where he sings over a pounding piano laced beat from up-and-coming producer, Bink! In the end it's what you would expect, hot, radio-friendly choruses with a good collection of MCs with the king of G-Funk crooning in the lead."
2,What I expected...,"I only got this cd because it was a free selection and it was just what I expected. Nate Dogg has a great singing voice and I love to hear him croon. But what he's talking about? He coulda kept to himself. IT's the same old California nonsense. I wasn't feeling this cd at all, besides the song with Jermaine Dupri (""Ring the Alarm"")."
2,DISSAPOINTED,"(...)! when i first heard the album, i started with track number nine (another short story) and it brought a smile to my face! yeS! i thought that Nate Dogg kept his original G-Funk style like on his first album G-funk classics but (...)! most songs got quest rappers and to ""hard"" beats that makes em boring. the song with pharaoe really (is bad)).. man im so dissapointed.. i allways talked about how good Nate is and recommended his album, but when i hear the new one it makes me angry. Why didnt he keep his jazzy and soulfull side? theres only two songs that i really like (Music and Me and Antoher Short Story) And the rest is fillers.. anoying ;(. I recommend people to buy this one for those 2 songs. And then buy His G-funk classic's album.On that one theres Lots of nice songs. like These days, scared of love, me and my homies, almost in love, my world, and many more. buy that double CD!! (and dont complain about my spellin' (im from sweden )"
4,Smooth House-Influenced Mixes,"I continue to come back to this CD when I need a house music ""fix"". The remixes add an entirely new layer to the originals - which were already great."
2,"""Remixed"" needs ""Re-doing""","Jean Mauick's Jazz-Funk delight, Incognito, has a solid arsenal of music that have developed into a resurgence of Brit-Pop. The idea to make the this music dancable and ""Disco-esque"" in Incognitos' ""Remixed"" was supposed to be a success. So why does it fail so miserably?Mauick's DJ's-for-hire group places too much emphasis on synch beats than cohesion. The result is a CD that is neither danceable - or likeable. New and frequent Incognito listeners will not be pleased with ""Remixed."" Rarely fun and remotely interesting, this CD should have had more of Mauick's input. The lack of interest clearly shows."
2,"I tried to like this, but...","I love piano ensembles, and Jason is very talented, but I sure don't enjoy anything on this recording. I kept it in the CD player for five days straight, and for me anyway, there is too much pointless noodling around. I have no problem with the ""new take on the blues"", but what take? Some sparse twanging, some nervous bass lines that I simply am not moved by and can't connect with at all, and some pounding. Perhaps this is just not my kind of music. But in fairness to myself, I can handle adventure, dissonance, noise, looseness; this just doesn't amount to much. I sure love the playing on Black Stars and the live Badwagon recording (except I still get too distracted by the nervous bass that seems like somebody playing in a diferent band in the next room), but this CD leaves me flat. I'll watch Jason because he is certainly ""the real deal"", no doubt about that, but I'd pass on this one."
1,Hope you get better ones than I did,"When I opened the package one of the individual packages was glued into the flaps of the box. I opened one package and put it in my usual sealed storage container. After a day, they stank to high heaven. They seemed swollen, as if heat or moisture had gotten to them even though each candy in each bag is individually wrapped The taste was terrible. I've thrown them all away - too much trouble to return. The lot I got was from Amazon LLC. I've been buying regular LifeSavers for a long time without problems (except they can't seem to find a supplier for Wild Berry regular).LifeSavers Sugar Free Sorbets, Arctic Berry Hard Candy, 2.75-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)"
3,Interesting Taste,"Not bad for a sugar Free product, taste is nothing like what you expect, but it does taste good, and it seems to last forever. Not nearly as good as the real thing though, but certainly an acceptable alternative."
4,Great Worship Aid,"I have owned this book for many years. I use it from time to time when I sense my relationship with the Lord has grown strained. As I contemplate the various names for Jesus, it helps me think of all the ways I am connected to Him. That helps revitalize my relationship with Him once again. With 700 names listed in this book, I am never at a loss for a new way to view my relationship with the Lord.Note: Elmer Towns was on my ordination council when I served at Thomas Road Baptist Church and a student at Liberty. However, we have had no personal communication in over 20 years so our past relationship has no bearing on this review."
5,I guess it's great,"I guess the Saddle club Collection is great for kids who don't have the movies Horse Crazy and Mane Event. When I first saw it on amazon.com I was so ecited. But today out it was just the movies Horse Crazy and Mane Event n one pack! Since I already have both movies it was a big bummer for me to find out.Anyway,I would suggest you buy the collection(if you don't have both movies)because both movies are great."
4,For people who love horses!!,"I absolutely love ""The Saddle Club"", so I was glad they combined the entire series onto video and DVD!! This movie is great because you don't have to wait for the episodes each Sunday. Or if you don't have satellite, you can watch the episodes."
4,One of Dolphy's Best,"I rank Iron Man among Dolphy's best discs and I have listened to quite a few of them. There is one problem with this disc and it has nothing to do with the music. The Fuel 2000 version of this great album all seem to have static noises on the last tune ""Ode to P.C."". I thought I had just bought a defective CD so I returned it to exchange for another copy but the new copy had the same problem. Unfortunately the static noise renders the last song unlistenable."
3,Many Essays,"Book contains many essays of varying dates, all about Madonna herself and her supposed impact on society. It was everything it was promised to be, although I still cannot get into the whole Madonnamania thing. She's more of an exhibitionist than anything else. If she hadn't crucified herself and hitchiked naked she would be forgotten by now, but that's just my opinion. Some essays are very favorable, some more critical. Good book for the fan or critic, or anyone into music."
5,Prayers. Best work yet,Perfect. Have read all your work and by far this is the most profound. It truly transcends all your prior writings.
3,Prayers: A communion with Our Creator,"This book is all about let bygones be bygones and moving on with life. If you think life treats you unfair, then it's up to you to change. It teaches how to pray and forgive."
4,"Good, but not great","Pros:Very high power outputQuietLooks niceCons:The 24V rail is extremely loose (it doesn't connect to the main connector directly, so it's on its own in the plug... it's become disconnected twice when I moved my computer over a short distance).The included power cable is also extremely loose. I accidentally nudged it when I was plugging in my headphones and the power flow was interrupted.Overall, it's a good power supply, but you may want to take extra measures to secure the 24V rail, and you should definitely buy a separate power cable."
1,Dreadful,"I'm comfortable with evangelical Christians and I loved Dylan's first couple of gospel albums. This ""documentary"" does neither any great credit. The best you can say for it is that the DVD is well-intentioned. But seldom have good intentions proved so dull. (Contains no original Dylan music.)"
1,Don't buy it!,"This was one of the biggest waste of money I've made in a while. There's no original music. The photos are grainy, and the music is all by Highway 61 Revisited. I can understand this guy's obsession with Dylan, but to profit off a half assed made DVD is not so cool. Do not buy, unless you like throwing money away."
1,Poor choice,Do not buy this DVD... it is not worth the money. Boring and with no Bob content. Lots of interviews but nothing really interesting for die hard Dylan folks.
3,Too LONG! Bad editing! But still ok....,"This EASILY could have been a 70 minute TIGHT documentary. Instead it's running time has been bloated with horrible shots of the director driving and walking around. It also has the worst editing I've ever seen in a docu. Every few seconds during the interviews the video will cut to a cheesy clip-art image of one of the subjects a person is talking about. If someone says ""drugs"" we are treated to pics of syringes in someone's arm. If they say ""car"" we are shown a lovely stock shot of a car for no reason. If they say ""funny"", cut to a clown's face...EXTREMELY annoying and childish. It would have been much better without all this amateurish bunk. Even with these faults I DID find this to be an interesting docu and appreciate the fact that someone bothered to tackle the subject of Dylan's conversion at all. I just wish it was shorter and without all the horrible stock images."
2,"Educational, i guess","I purchased this for my husband for Christmas as he is a really big Dylan fan. It didn't live up to the glowing reviews that i had read, it could have been done better, a little corny. But it was informative, we learned some things we hadn't know before. Left us wanting to see more old footage of Dylan's concerts and music!"
4,My son likes it,"I got this for my son at Christmas. He likes it, especially since it resembles a Pokeball. It is smaller than I expected, but very cute and holds quite a few cards. I plan to order another so that he can store the rest of his 100+ cards."
4,Unbelievable - AAA+++,"THis is the Greatest loper I have ever used - I have cut down thousands of tree limbs with this and it is still a sharp as the day I bought it, nice grips never received one blister - bought one for my 92yr old great great grandmother that uses it regulary"
1,"Script, not a book",I didn't realize that this was a script for a play and not a book. Maybe I didn't look that closely.
1,An Author Who Didn't Check the Facts,"I read this book because my father is a retired Air Force fighter pilot and Vietnam veteran. Imagine my shock when I found myself reading about him on page 52. I telephoned him immediately because he was mentioned in a negative light. As I quoted the passage about him and others he lived with and fought with to him over the phone -- he remembered the days events in a completely different manner. ""Tax's"" rememberance of the Kep Airfield incident wasn't factual. Sounds like he had some axes to grind. What a bunch of sour grapes he spouts. If this recount is so glaring wrong I can only imagine how many others also are. The first rule of jounalism is to check and then recheck the facts. How many other men were slammed without being able to respond or defend themselves? The author never called my father. Bet he didn't call anyone else portrayed in these heresay conversations. I couldn't believe a word that was written after page 52. You shouldn't either."
3,Poor history,"I have read several books of this type and though this one provides quite specific details, they turn out to be quite different from other books. Sometimes I feel like the author making new stuff for the fun of the readers (for example the battle of the air force on May 10 1972). Another thing is that this one purely tells stories rather making deep analysis about the airwar, the formations, and technical issues. Better spend your money on ""Clashes"" of Marshal L. Michel III."
2,Mostly misses the story,"Sherwood tells the story mostly from the view point of Air Force missions and surprisingly, mostly from navigators. The yarns are mostly good although there are some silly statements. The reader will get almost no idea that Naval Aviation had any real presence in North Vietnam. Where are the stories about the A4 Skyhawk which probably had the most missions of any type of aircraft flown up north? Where are the A7 stories? Most aggravating of all, not a single mention of the Navy's Ace, Randy Cunningham. Where are the stories of the Navy pilots who flew 300 and 400 missions? Every pilot who flew up North has some hilarious stories and some heartbreaking stories. You missed almost all of them, Sherwood. Also, before one puts Official Naval Historian under one's name he really should know something about the US Navy and Naval Aviation. I had over 200 missions over there and would say to the reader, you really will only get half the story in this book. The Air Force half."
1,Poor History...,"I see that Mr. Smallwood likes S.L.A. Marshall; no wonder. Marshall made up much of his work, especially the infamous ""only one man in ten in combat fires his weapon,"" and it seems Smallwood follows his example by making up episodes to keep the book interesting. Much of what he says, especially the Ritchie/Lodge episodes, is simply wrong, except perhaps from Ritchie's eyes. One shudders to think this person will be writing serious history for the Navy. Skip it -- try Thud Ridge for real combat action and Clashes for real history, or wait a few months for Rebound."
2,Cracked crock,"We loved this slow cooker - almost 2 years of use, used maybe 10 times. Just took it out to use again and noticed a hairline crack right through the middle. Based on the feedback here, going to try to get the insert replacement OR just look for another crockpot. Luckily we got ours at a really good deal, so it's not that hard to give up."
1,Faulty Crock,Would not purchase this again and I'm no longer interested in any KitchenAid appliance.This is the most dreadful experience I've ever had with a cooking issue. During the past 18 to 24 months I have gone through at least 4 and possibly 5 crocks. Each one has developed hairline cracks following one or two uses. The most recent crock lasted about 4 uses before it broke. The company knows it has problems. They won't recall and my last email about the problem was totally ignored.I am no longer interested in any KitchenAid equipment!
3,Everything's OK except the insert,"I bought this cooker 2 years ago and am on my 3rd insert. They crack. The first replacement was free, but I paid $30+ for this new one and if I had paid for the other I would be 1/2 the cost of the cooker. It does a good job, cooks lots of food, but I won't replace this insert again, I'll buy a new slow cooker from another company. KitchenAid is well aware of the problem and as long as they can keep selling replacements what do they care. Maybe someone should invent a metal replacement insert that would solve the problem."
1,dont wast your money!!,The pot cracks - i'm on my 3rd replacement - that's all i can say - dont buy it - waste of money! would have given 0 stars if i could..
1,Crock Cracked,"Boought a Kitchen Aid Crockpot about a year or so ago the first crock cracked on the second use contacted Kitchen Aid and they replaced the pot at no charge and the second one cracked in the same spot on the second use at that point they wanted me to pay for a replacement which didn't seem like a profitable idea so now I have a crock pot that cost over a hundred dollars that is worthless. I figure the cost of the four meals prepared in it were expensive since it was over twenty five dollars for each use of the crockpot. My advice, do not buy this crock pot!"
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!,"Don't buy it or you'll be sorry. The guarantee should be that the crock will crack and Kitchen Aid will replace it while under warranty. But guess what, that beautiful roast you were trying to cook is ruined and your counter will be a mess. And don't even think of leaving the house while you are using this or you might burn your house down.I honestly don't see how KA can continue to sell this product. I purchased this cooker because we needed more room than our smaller rival cooker that has lasted for many years with NO problems. I didn't read any reviews till it was too late. OOps!Our cooker worked great the first time we used it. So the second time we set it overnight to wake up with a huge mess in our kitchen. How could this be? Well the crock cracked and leaked all over the place.Long story short. KA will never get my business again. That's how strongly I feel about how shoddy this item is and about how they don't care about the customer."
1,Pot cracks,On my 5th use the pot cracked. Very dissappointed with the quality for such an expensive product. I've been a kitchenaid fan for a long time but between bad coffee pots and this item I will be looking elsewhere.
1,Not reliable - Cracks in Pot are Common,"I bought this as a gift for my wife who has used our $15 Rival crockpot for 30 years. The KitchenAid KSC700 looked like the best. BUT BE WARNED... these pots crack even when they have been handled properly. Our unit was NEVER handled improperly, but it developed crack after crack. It still worked fine, but by the time we got up to six or seven cracks, we were afraid to use it. When we called KitchenAid, they essentially blamed it on us. I pointed out to them that we had been using the Rival we got as a wedding gift for over 30 years and THAT pot NEVER cracked. They offered to sell us a new pot/insert for $40 - enough to by two cheap Rivals that won't crack. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT."
1,the liner will crack (only has a 1 year warranty),"We had this over 2 years before it cracked, but it DID crack and it now leaks. KitchenAid will no budge on this -1 year from date of purchase warranty. It will cost you $45 to get a replacement (and since (according to KitchenAid) there is no problem with it -it will likely break again. Check into the Cuisinart Slow Cooker (not really great reviews on that one either, but at least it has a 3 year warranty)."
1,No More KitchenAid Products for Me,"Bought the 7 QT slow cooker a few months ago. Tried to use it for the first time yesterday. After six hours on high not one single degree rise in temperature. Total failure. I Called KitchenAid and based on the serial number they said warranty period had elapsed and they would not replace the unit even though it had never been used. The best part, however, is that they offered to sell me another cooker at the same price they sell it to retailers!! In effect no discount-they just bypassed the retailer and made the same profit on the 2nd unit."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!!,We got the KitchenAid Slow Cooker Red for a gift a few years ago and used it for just under a year and the insert cracked. We called KitchenAid and they replaced the insert under warranty and we used it like once and it cracked. They sent us another and it cracked again. I asked for my money back and they insisted on just sending me a whole new stainless steal slow cooker. We have used that a few times and every time it over cooks the food on the lowest cooking level and ruins our meals. So today I called and said I wanted my money back and they won't give me my money back. They just gave me a credit for KitchenAid. This whole ordeal has been such a pain and I am really disappointed in KitchenAid. I just ordered a Sunbeam crock pot and hopefully that one will work well. Don't waist your time and money on this product.
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. It has some sort of design flaw that causes the crocks to crack. We have gone through 2. Kitchen Aid replaced the first one under warranty but in spite of all of the customer complaints they don't acknowledge that there is a flaw in this product.
1,Cracked Crock Pot,"There is so much to love about the design/features of this crockpot that it's a shame the crock is no good. Kitchenaid provided me with a THIRD crock, which promptly cracked 15 minutes into my pork spareribs this morning. I began to think maybe it's only because I bought a refurbished unit until I read reviews here, Macy's, JC Penneys - and more - all saying the same. I can't believe they haven't solved the problem. It may well be that the element is just too hot, but then they should issue a recall for all. Don't be tempted...it's a bad product in it's current state. Too bad I sold my old little crock at a garage sale! 20 years and it never cracked!"
5,Great purchase,"We've owned this crock-pot for over three years now, and it's still going strong. What I particularly like about this one is its size--there weren't too many out there that were as large. For all the effort of cutting up veggies, meat, etc., I always like to double/triple the recipe and make everything in larger batches...so the size was key for me. Also really like the ""simmer/stay-on"" functions, so if I'm away when it finishes, I'll come back to a still-warm meal. Very dependable, easy-to-use, and also nice-looking on the kitchen counter."
1,KitchenAid Crockpot cracked,"The insert to my KitchenAid crock pot has also cracked. I am currently trying to find a replacement. The crockpot itself worked well for about 6 months, but came home to liquid leaking over my counter. Worried about how safe the unit is, but it appears that the drainage holes on the bottom just made a mess. Disappointing."
1,KitchenAid Slow Cooker Ceramic Pot CRACKED...one of several hundred complaints on line...,"Ordered the KitchenAid Slow Cooker as an addition to our KitchenAid counter top collection. Sure, I read the reviews, but I knew KitchenAid had a great reputation. In addition to this slow cooker, I remodled our kitchen and purchased 4four KitchenAid appliances. I had problems with all of the 3 except the microwave oven. Apparently, KitchenAid has comprised their quality control on their appliances. This is not what I would expect from a company that I had held high in regard. Consumers who are considering purchasing this appliance should review the KitchenAid consumer forums for this slow cooker and above products before they purchase. I had a very bad experience with their customer servies departments on all of the above. I will never do business with them again."
2,cracked crock,"I ordered this slow cooker over the summer, and haven't had an occasion to use it until today. Bought a lovely roast and found a great recipe to try. Lo and behold, 15 minutes into the 8 hour cooking time I heard a loud pop and found a 4"" crack running up the side of the crock. I immediately unplugged the unit, removed all the food and transferred it to my trusty cast iron dutch oven. Kitchenaid is sending a replacement crock so I don't have a brand-new, useless $130 appliance. Hope the 2nd crock lasts more than 15 minutes."
5,I like it!,"I like the auto feature - put food in, turn it off, come back when it's done! Yes, it's heavy - but it cooked enough venison stew for 7 adults & a little left over."
1,yet another cracked insert,"I've used it many times with no problems over a few years. Then I was clumsy and broke the original insert while washing it. The replacement KitchenAid crock arrived a week ago. This insert has NOT been banged around and it has NOT been exposed to extreme temperature swings. That means I waited until it was at room temp before washing it for use and did not place frozen food in it. It was not filled with food, placed into the fridge, then put into the cooker base. Even though it was handled with much care, it cracked within 15 minutes of being used for the first time. Until today, I would have only said good things about the cooker. Obviously I cannot recommend it now. I don't know why I had no issues with the first insert, but the replacement one broke immediately. Not worth the money for sure."
3,What's up with the lid??,"On every single one of these KitchenAid slow cookers that I've seen, the gap between the lid and the crock is absolutely huge. Even the saleslady at Sur la Table was flabbergasted when I showed them to her, and she admitted that she would not purchase one of these for that reason. The ones at Bed, Bath, and Beyond were the same. Sounds like an across-the-board problem to me-- I can see evaporation being an issue. That being said, I purchased the All-Clad slow cooker, and I am a very satisfied customer."
1,not durable,"After 2 years ( I used it 4 or 5 times per year) the insert crack while using it and made a mess in the main heater part of the slowcooker, almost caught on firedo not buy that crookpot only 1 year warranty on it it's a shame."
2,Crock continues to Crack,"This would be a great crock pot if the crock didn't continue to crack. My first one cracked after a year. When I ordered a replacement they told me be sure to thaw the meat first, etc. I followed instructions exactly and the 2nd one cracked after about 6 uses, so money wasted and I need to find another brand to purchase. There are many, many complaints about this so obviously there's something wrong, they just won't acknowledge it. Buy a Cuisinart instead."
1,"After three broken inserts, we threw it away...","At first we thought it broke because we cooked a small chicken in it that wasn't completely thawed. We called and paid $35 for a new liner. We were careful not to put anything that wasn't completely thawed in it and it popped and sizzled again. We spent another $35 for a new insert and the same thing happened shortly after. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice same on me. We should have given up after two broken inserts, but the third indicates it must be an engineering or manufacturing flaw. We probably got 8 good meals from it and lost 3, spending way too much. It's too bad, because it's a nice large slow cooker with many settings. We replaced it with a cheap and simple Hamilton Beach cooker that's smaller but has been completely reliable and hasn't broken yet."
5,In Love with This CrockPot,"I have owned this crockpot for a little over a year and use it mostly in the fall and winter. In fact, in the winter, I make oatmeal in it every week. Well, knock on wood, because I haven't experienced anything like what so many of the other reviewers have commented on. There are no cracks and my food doesn't burn. I'm really glad I purchased it (the size is great if you like to cook a lot of food) and hope that it will last for many more years!!"
1,Cracked Pot,"We purchased this slow cooker and were looking forward to meals that were no longer dried out and mushy from overcooking. After ONE use, the ceramic cracked and liquid leaked underneath to provide us with a sticky mess. So far, Amazon has made returning this product easy, but I should have been more aware of others who reviewed this for the same problem."
1,Cheap junk,"Original and 2 replacements had problems. Cheap manufacturing - two had warped lids, all three had defects in the ceramic pots glazing -- bad news b/c a hole in the glazing is a harbor for bacteria. Tested one of them for temps and there was no difference between low/simmer and buffet -- both were ~207 degrees. Third unit didn't come with a lid. KitchenAid's policy that the misfiting lids are due to something other than poor quality manufacturing is a bunch of malarchy. I can buy a cheap 7qt slow cooker if I want this sloppy quality. Wiling to pay more for quality products but the KitchenAid products I have bought over the past 5 yrs are cheap junk. The MBA's are maximizing short-term profits by riding the KA brand and selling this crud at our expense.Sorry to offend the dedicated KA fans but this is my experience."
2,defective,The heating element is defective. This is my second one. Don't know how to return it. Threw away box. Help!
3,"KitchenAid KSC700SS 7-Quart Slow Cooker, Stainless Steel","KitchenAid KSC700SS 7-Quart Slow Cooker, Stainless SteelMy concern is that the rubber lip on the lid does not fit flat on the ceramic insert, and creates a gap for the steam and flavor to escape. The wife likes it, but for me it should seal. We have not contact Kitchen Ais but will shortly."
2,OK - But not worth the money,"This slow cooker works OK, but not worth the money compared to other similar products.The worse part is the clean up of the inside aluminum cooking area. After cooking the first roast beef a little juice got on the aluminum. After cooking the roast and using normal cleaning methods and then using Ajax, steel-wool and several other items to remove the stains it was impossible. The engineers who designed this product must never have cooked in their life and never expected anything to dirty the pot, otherwise they would have selected another material. No one wants to spend nearly one half hour on trying to remove a small stain and then not be able to accomplish such a small task. KithchenAid dropped the ball with this item. :-(Plus, there are other slow cookers on the market that work as good and a lot less expensive."
1,All Cracked Up!,"Please listen to the reviews on this product. I had mine for about a year. I was using it one day and heard a loud ""POP"" and my liner had cracked. After looking for replacement liners, I found that others had the same problem I did with the liner cracking. Kitchenaid obviously has an engineering problem with the liner and I'm not even going to bother trying to get another liner. I'm sure I can get a much better product for the price as a new liner. Beware! This product is not worth the money!"
1,Disappointed as it cracked,"I looked forward to receiving this and was so disappointed after it cracked on about the fourth time I used it. I continued to use it this way until it leaked through and made it impossible. It seems to me that for a slow cooker it gets much too hot on the low setting (which is what I use most frequently) I have been unsuccessfully trying to locate a new insert, hoping I would not have this problem again. I loved the size, the appearance and the convenience of using the crockpot. This was the second one I have had that did this. The first one literally exploded. It had been a gift and I didn't know if there had been something wrong already and so bought another one from the CHEF'S catalog."
1,Great til it breaks.,"This is the second one of these crock pots I've had. The first one had a crack in the ceramic pot after just a couple of uses so I went to the store and replaced it (it was still new). I hadn't used it for about a year until today. When I pulled the ceramic out after the meal to clean it there was the dreaded glob o' crispy goo on the inside of the cooker. Sure enough, I found a hairline crack in the ceramic pot. Twice is enough for me. The crock pot goes in the trash and I go looking for a different brand tomorrow."
1,Beware! Glass Lid Shattered while Cooking,"I like a well made and good looking product which is why we registered for this slow cooker (Kitchen Aid KSC700SS) when we got married in 2007. We just started using it and after 3 uses, the glass lid shattered while cooking. VERY DANGEROUS!!! We made beef stew and after 7 hours of cooking, we were almost ready to eat. I lifted the to check the meat for doneness and then returned to the cooker 15 min later and the lid had shattered around the edge (about 1/2 in from the rubber gasket). Wow! It looked like a broken car windshield. We gingerly removed it by sliding it off on a cookie sheet and had to dispose of the entire meal. What a disappointment!!!! Now we're waiting for a response from the Kitchen Aid ""Safety"" department. Isn't the glass supposed to be tempered? It's over 3 years old so I'm certain out of warranty. With this issue and the potential for cracks to the ceramic pot, I would STAY AWAY from this slow cooker!!!!"
5,A great slow cooker,"I was looking for a slow cooker and read reviews of many Rival cookers online. While there were good reviews, there were also a number of reviews describing problems with water boiling over and with the temperature of the pot getting too high. I found the KitchenAid and due to its recent introduction into the market, did not find many reviews. I did not find any negatives however except for the weight. As my intention was to use it only at home, this was not an issue for me. It is heavy, but it is large-capacity and has a beautiful, sturdy ceramic insert (so this is to be expected). I had also considered the Cuisinart slow cooker, but did not like the appearance. I liked the appearance of the KitchenAid. I have used it twice thus far and enjoyed the ease of use. There were no problems with temperature or water boiling over. Best yet, the food was delicious!"
5,Outstanding Product,This product is better than advertised. I researched several models and this particlar model was very well rated but a bit more expensive than I had hoped to pay. Since my purchase I have found that this model has exceeded my expectations and has turned out to be an excellent buy. The diffrent cooking modes with the timer are so helpful. I have made several dishes and slow cooking truely brings out the rich flavors of your dish. Clean up was very easy as well.
1,DO NOT BUY,Just adding my 2 cents worth to everyone else's... I love the way the unit cooks but the cracked crock is a ....crock
1,Crocks crack repeatedly,"Well our crock cracked again yesterday. This is our 2nd replacement and now we are out of warranty, so we would have to pay for the part ourselves. A new ceramic crock insert is $79! Outrageous! I wish I would have known before I spent $140 thinking I would have this slow cooker for years."
3,Good but pot cracks,"Love the features on this cooker. We have had to replace the ceramic pot, however, three times. The first time was probably our fault because we tried to wash it before it had cooled completely. The second one cracked after 11 months for no apparent reason (we have been very cautious since the first experience). I will say one thing about Kitchenaid--they honor their warranty. I do think Kithchenaid needs to buy a more forgiving ceramic pot for this cooker. They might have to raise the price a little but it would save their reputation."
5,Best EVER,"I have had my KitchenAid slow cooker for about six months now, and I can recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone considering a purchase. I often cook for just myself, and other times for the family. Either way, this cooker is the one for the job. If for example you are doing a batch of boston baked beans, you'll be glad you have the 7-quart size. If on the other hand you are just making a supper for one or two, the 7-quart size is perfect for the job, especially if your meat selection is tall or wide. The cover and crock itself are both designed to work great together. The top of the crock is extra-wide and the top nestles inside the crock, so even when your pot is full, there is no chance of an overflow. The heat and time controls are intuitive and easy to use. Not only that, there is an online group of avid users ready and willing to share recipes. I love this slow cooker, and I am sure you will too!"
2,Beautiful....ehhh,Loved the Bang Tango - Save Me is a solid rock tune. That's not worth the price of a CD though. Other songs area weak filler. Buy a Daughtry CD instead.
3,A Change Of Sound...,"Not quite what I was expecting, as their first release combined the raw energy with catchy riffs and singalong melodies that combined the best of Dirty Looks combined with today's Nu-Rock. The result was something that got it airplay.This time around, the raw energy is still there, but there's not a standout track that bounces around in my head afterward. The final song, an ill-attempt at a ballad, is just plain embarrassing."
4,"Latin, Part II","I used Latin, Part I last semester and am pleased to see this edition uses the same format and builds on knowledge gained in Part I."
2,water damaged,"the book i received was water damaged and stained. half of the pages were stuck together. i can still use the book, i guess, but would there will be certain inconveniences."
1,Not Worth It,"DISAPOINTMENT!!!I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM AND THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY IS I'M DISAPOINTED!!!this album is a prime example of why if your not sure you should listen to a album before you buy it...what a rip off...album is boring and not creative at all...some of the just plain wACkest beats you will ever hear...you see all the big names and think it's going to be hot but it ain't...half the joints the beats are so wack that no matter who's on it it's going to stink...and the best song by Joe Buddens everybody already has it...came out a long long long time ago.if you don't have it DOWNLOAD it, don't waste your money on this...Clinton Sparks if you reading this you owe me money because this cd is crapola."
5,"Spiritually uplifting, devotional and hauntingly beautiful","I just saw the movie on Bravo 2 weeks ago as I was dozing off to sleep on my couch. The soundtrack woke me up and IPTAL haunted me- I kept hearing it in my dreams and I knew I had to buy this CD right away. I was thrilled to find it and I have played this CD in my car, house and at work every day for the last week. And I still love the haunting melodies and driving drum tracks on this CD. My gratitude to the composers and artists who are on the tracks. Beautiful, spiritual, and can be played endlessly never tiring of it. I find new meaning in every song over an over again. I hope Transcendental produces more beautiful music such as this again."
5,outstanding,I am Turkish but never a huge fan of Turkish music but this soundtrack takes the essence of classical melodies and turns it into something fresh and stimulating.
5,Steam - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,This terrific soundtrack evokes the mood of the exotic Mideast with magnificent rythms in both orchestrations and vocals...
3,Not as pictured! Colors way off!,"I will start with the positive. It is a beautiful fan and opens up nicely. However, the colors are not as pictured! I purchased the ""Glorious Dream"" fan and while it shows mainly hues of blues on the website, it actually is more hues of purple with a few spots of blue. I am very disapoointed because this was to go on my Asian China cabinet and my dining roon has hues of blues, not any purple."
5,It's a miracle!,"Ever since I installed my new 5-Inch Pink and White Hagen Vibrascaper Foxtail, my fish have stopped trying to escape."
3,good for your hobby,this is a tool for the beginner not the seasond prolooking for something cheep to get your hobby off to a good startlook no farther show it off to your friendsand look like a pro doing it
4,Dia,A surprisingly inexpensive device that does exactly what you want it to do.Many similar testers are listed for prices way above this one.Why pay more for the same thing?We're very happy with it.
2,NOT USER FRIENDLY,"THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, ALL SORTS OF REQUIREMENTS AND POSITIONS TEMPERATURES AND SIZES OF STONES MUST BE CALCULATED IN ORDER TO ALLEGEDLY GET AN ACCURATE RESPONSE....****NOTE THIS PRODUCT THINKS MY WIFE'S WATCH CRYSTAL IS A DIAMOND.....NEED I SAY MORE?....HEY HONEY MAYBE IT MEANT YOU ARE A DIAMOND :)"
3,Diamond Tester,I thought my diamond tester would have been more designed like the one's you would see in a jewelry store.....
2,Not impressed,"Not very accurate. Can't get it to work very well, beeps on everything from diamonds to glass. Still not sure if it's a diamond or not."
1,Diamond Tester does not work at all,Have tried this product on several items. You have to do to many manual inputs and has not gotten the correct answer on diamonds once This is a cheaply made tool and does not work at all
4,Battery tray for trolling batteries,The tray works as advertised. Nothing negative to say about it. Be sure you know what size your batteries are as these are sized accordingly.
3,Could be stronger.,"The tray is not very strong for the $20+ I paid with shipping. It's so thin that mine came warped. It would of received 4 or 5 star if it were thicker. Other than that, it does what it's supposed to do - hold two batteries."
5,Freedom,"This book to me has offered a lot of freedom to blindly follow God and not have to follow Him with my intellect - through intellectual study, prayer requests, going to church, etc. Those things are excellent and I do them. But where my heart really goes is intuitively and blindly and recklessly abandoning myself to His guidance. Guyon validates those of us who end up feeling like we are going backwards when really God is taking us truly forward in leaps and bounds. God's ways are certainly not ours and Guyon does a fabulous job of helping us understand His heart."
3,Very difficult to understand,"I'm going to have to read this book again before I get it. Even the foreword says it is difficult to understand, and as I found out, it is."
4,Great!,"The fit a little funny at first, but after heating up in the car a few times, they sort of formed to the seats. You can't really tell they're seat covers because they attach under the seat. The color was awesome for my car interior, which is slightly less than dark grey. Unfortunately, because I have leather seats under these seat covers, they make a funky squeaking noise sometimes when the two leathers rub together."
3,DON'T BUY IF YOU NEED THE NUT THAT GOES ON TOP,"Giving it a ""3"" stars for Average in function as I have no clue. So, 3 stars is where you start before you go up or down. Mine has no nut on it... too much trouble to trek down to the post office to send it back. The picture does show a 'new' one without the nut... but it should be in the title or description as well IMO."
3,it is fine I suppose,"It works, but why are they skimping on the contact nut. They didn't include one. I know some applications don't use one, so how about they put one on it and if it is not needed people can discard it rather than making people who need one look all over town. The plug I was removing had a non-removable cap."
4,memory lane but still germaine,"While the examples (three-page index of of songs used as examples) may sound dated (Kum Ba Yah, Stephen Foster songs, Shenandoah, etc.) there are examples of hymns well-known today as well (Rock of Ages, Silent Night, Softly and Tenderly, Immortal Invisible God, etc.). I have never seen such a thorough set of beat patterns, from 2/2 to 12/8 and 5 patterns, for example. I myself put more emphasis on leading with the voice and using the hand to indicate a pulse (as I write in You Can Lead Singing, 1995). But this is an enlightened, democratic approach to singing. I'm glad I got it and read it. This small 111-page book is in the Basic Series from Abingdom. Another book in the series is Erik Routley's classic on church music, which indicates the tone it sets."
3,Poor recording,"The songs are ok, but the CD is poor, sounds like a worn record on an old record player. Nostalgic, but not clear."
5,Love it!,Loved the whole series. I will definitely be reading her other books. Brings the Old Testament alive and relevant to us.
3,Not as good as the first 3,"I really loved the first three books in this series! It made me fall in love with King Hezekiah and Historical fiction based on Biblical truths. I felt like the children of my beloved characters in the first three books weren't as well developed. I didn't believe the progression of their faith the way I did with their fathers and mothers. Honestly, while I loved all the characters in the first 3 books, I didn't really like any of the characters in these last two. It's still worth a read but didn't reach the excellence of its predecessors for me."
5,The best book series ever!!!! Excellent!,This book was great. All 5 of them are excellent. You cant put them down they are filled with so much action. Very biblical and historical!!! Worth every minute!!!
5,Fanatstic,"As always Austins research, contextual depth and richness and scriptural integrity make for a fascinating read that makes biblical history so much easier to remember."
5,Enthralling,"Just like the first three, wonderful...captivating...faith-building..truth-revealing. Well done! Can't wait to start book five! I highly recommend reading this series!"
4,Argentina verdad,"Porteno o estanciero, whether from the sophisticated Buenos Aires or the ranches of patagonia, this album offers the musical variety that IS Argentina. Zambas of the countryside or tangos; classical selections (Caminito by Placido Domingo), a beautiful a capela quartet and the religious El Senior Juan Sebastian or the ballad voice of Mercedes Sosa; instrumentals or vocals; all on one CD. When hosting a party for friends visiting from Argentina, this is always on the player. When lonesome for my ""segundo pais,"" this carries me back."
2,Just ok,"I ordered these because I needed a casual white sandal and they had a little extra detail to them. They aren't very comfortable. The leather thong in the toe is too rigid and caused blisters. Also, they make my feet look very long and big. They run true to size."
5,SERGIO IS A HYPER-GENIOUS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sergio's Oceano is fantastic;full of color, warmth, rhythm, taste, regardless of ballads or up-beat cuts. Gracinha Leporace's voice is still awesome, and the collaborations of several great personalities like Gilberto Gil, Emmanuel and Zucchero are invaluable. The combination of the album? Brazilian Jazz, Samba, MPB, etc. Don't pass this album by, if you already know Sergio, you'll love this one; if you're new into the Brazilian realm of music, this CD will blow you away, purchase it a.s.a.p., you'll be thankful you did."
5,Perfect,"Obviously the tea kettle is lovely, and it works perfectly. I've not encountered many of the problems mentioned by reviewers of this and other Chantal kettles. The handle, in my experience, does not get too hot. I've had the kettle for about a month, and it ALWAYS whistles beautifully. It is smallish; it makes enough water for me and my husband to have a large cup of tea each, and that's it. I'm definitely satisfied with this purchase. I don't think anybody makes a more elegant kettle."
1,Not worth a dime,"I have bought hundreds of products over the past several years through Amazon, and this is the first time I've felt compelled to review something becuase of how bad the product is. I guess it's true when they say you don't hear from most people unless they're unhappy - although I do contact management when we feel that an individual has done an exceptional job. This tea kettle has got to be the worst consumer product I have ever purchased - especially at this price. It makes all kinds of gurgling sounds as the water heats up, spits water out of the spout as it boils and the whistle is very sporadic. After only a few uses, rust marks already started appearing. I thought I would be getting something special at this price, but any tea kettle I've owned at less than $30 is far superior to this. This thing is so bad, I couldn't even give it away - it's gone straight into the garbage and has turned me off from ever buying a Chantal product again."
2,Poor design,"A wretched design. The lid doesn't fit well, so most of the steam escapes through it, leaving only enough pressure for an weak whistle. (If you push down on the lid it'll give a nice harmonica sound.)The non-insulated handle is ugly as well as inconvenient. The attachment point has visible lockwashers sticking out. There are lots of little places where it looks like the designers didn't know what they were doing.Tou can get a much better kettle for $30."
5,Wow!,"do yourself a favor and buy this on tape. listen to it while driving, or whatever, and your heart will dance!"
2,A church laughs at itself,"The Disciples of Christ are one of the smaller ""mainline"" denominations in America. We're used to people not knowing who we are.Through completing the sentence of the title, Polk (and others who have sent him their ideas) spell out a little bit about who we are in ways that cause those of us in the Disciples to get a chuckle.Most of the humor is only appreciated by those of us on the inside, but the humor can also help us to understand ourselves a little better.I may use it in church as a way of explaining a bit of our history and polity in a more informal setting."
5,Highly recomended!!,"For anyone interested on romanesque and gothic religious architecture.This book contains very detailed artwork on several cathedrals of Europe,facades,interiors,altarpieces,statues,columns,amazing detailed reliefs,etc.The engravings are excellent,just marvel at the reproductions of Cologne cathedral,St Stephen's on Vienna,Florence's cathedral,and several more..A very recomended book of religious architecture."
1,Alta watch,I had real bad luck with this watch. I tried two watches and neither one worked. The first one had no display and the second one you couldn't change it to feet. I sent bought of them back.
1,Poor quality; not very efficient,"I took a chance on this watch from a close-out retailer who agreed to put a new battery in it prior to shipping. Cost was under $20.The watch has a lot of wasted space on the face of it, devoting the bottom line of the three line display to telling you which mode it is in. For example, when the day/date is displayed on the top line and the time is in the center, the bottom third of the watch reads ""CLOCK."" All modes display like that.Calibrating is a bit of a chore but works if you follow the directions very closely. It's easy to miss something and have to start over again.The second day I had the watch, set and ready to go, I headed out to a local hilly park for a workout. By the end of my warmup mile the START/STOP button was missing from the watch, rendering it worthless.My opinion? If you see one of these for any price, avoid it. Even if it worked as the manufacturer designed it it's not worth the money."
4,"A good western, beautiful cinematography, Leo Gordon","This is as good as any solid western of the '50's. Leo Gordon, one of the scariest bad guys from many westerns, plays Quantrill who wants revenge on Lawrence, Kansas for kicking him out of town years ago. Steve Cochran, a Confederate spy, comes to town to help him but develops second thoughts along with affection for the girl, a boy, and the townspeople. It may not be historically accurate but the ending satisfies. Cochran is good; he should have had more starring roles.The cinematography is excellent. There aren't really any vast western vistas and it looks like many westerns were filmed around these parts. On the other hand, the placement of the camera and composition of the shots makes it look totally fresh and exciting. A job well done. And there are lots of scenes outside of town, enough to even satisfy me.And it has Leo Gordon."
5,Awesome,"It's truly amazing that this work was created in 1974 with, I believe, all non-electric instruments. I'm a big fan of ambient/downtempo/minimalist electronica and I think that, for sheer beauty and ""out-there""-ness, this album is pretty hard to beat. Amazingly expansive sounds that ebb and flow in an organic rhythmic symphony. Or something like that...definitely not like anything else I've come across, and an incredibly powerful album. Listen to it on a rainy Sunday with a cup of coffee or tea. A must-own in my opinion."
5,Exhausting - and so beautiful,"I discovered Steve Reich through a book on Philip Glass. I came on-line and bought this piece as an introduction. On my first listen, I went into another world. My entire body relaxed. Anticipation for small little details eat at me when I listen to it now. If you want to introduce yourself to this style of composing - this is the piece I recomend. What a masterpiece!"
5,Mesmerizing!,"That sure is one mesmerizing hour-long work. I remembered first hearing parts of the work on the PBS Series ""Cosmos"" (particulaly, ""Pulses"", Sections I and IIIb). It wouldn't be until recently (about 2002) that I find out that it was ""Music for 18 Musicians"" by Steve Reich. The ECM recording contains 1 track. I have the Nonesuch CD (which I like as much) which separates the sections into tracks - which I think it could've (or should've) been done on the ECM CD as well. I managed to figure out when a section begins by carefully comparing both CDs. I notice that the ECM mentioned 10 sections (possibly a missprint) while the Nonesuch mentioned 11. Here's listing which I think would be helpful to those who listen to the ECM CD:Pulses 0:00I 3:46II 8:03IIIA 12:04IIIB 16:02IV 20:05V 25:53VI 31:24VII 35:53VIII 39:29IX 42:47X 47:01XI 48:34Pulses 52:50"
3,Makes Great Background Music,"As a fan of contemporary classical music I had this piece recommended to me by several friends, but I feel pretty ambivalent whenever I listen to it. This may have been ground-breaking when it was first composed, but to me it sounds like so much trance music. It's not something that I could listen to just for the sake of listening to it, because there isn't enough material for me to find it interesting; but because of that, and because its sounds are soothing, it makes for solid background music while I'm at work."
4,great deal,I was a bit worried but when i received my book i was very impressed.Don`t be afraid to do biz with them.
1,not so good,We have purchased two CritterTrails and have not been happy with either one. The reason we didn't like this one the shelves would not stay in place. We had two hamsters in it and when they were playing they could knock it down. The litter also gets everywhere. You can't use it without the shelves because the water bottle is to high for them to reach without being on a shelf. It also is not very easy to put together or stay together and hard to clean without taking it all apart. Since cages should only be cleaned when the hamsters are awake that means in the evenings and it took much to long for a night task. The colors are pretty but the cage is not user friendly.
3,"OK, could be better...","I bought the critter trail one to begin, and after a few mishaps i managed to crack the plastic on the bottom and break off a few pieces. I then bought the critter trail 2 in hopes of less disaster. The plastic on these cages are very weak, and if you attatch an extra tube or something and then want to take it off you have to careful not to pull too hard or it will crack. My hamster really likes having the two stories, however, I have had to use strong take in a few situations, and it's not the easiest thing to clean. So if hamster happiness is what you're looking for, then this is a great cage, but if you're looking for an easy, sturdy cage, you might want to look into something else."
4,hamster cage,not a bad little cage. i liked it and its very colorful. the only downside is that it doesnt have enough hamster tubes and the levels work better upside down (the smooth surface is to slippery and the hamsters fall off). u can still attach a tube to the level upside down and u can even put some shavings in it that way to keep it cleaner. its a bit of a pain to get it all together but its worth it :)
1,Absolutely not for mice,"Despite the description saying this cage can be used for mice, there are a few huge flaws in that. First, the water bottle that comes with the cage has a spring behind the ball that is too strong for a mouse to move. My mice were getting no water from it. Second, there are holes near the door latches that are big enough for mice to squeeze right through. If I hadn't noticed either of these before it was too late my mice would likely be either dead of dehydration or lost. They can also move the petting zone up from the bottom enough to squeeze through the hole, but thankfully you can fix that by making sure you have the tube connected from the petting zone to the bottom tray.For bigger rodents the cage would probably work just fine if you don't mind ill-fitting shelves and noisy wheel, but I would suggest anyone with mice to stay away and save themselves the headache."
1,worst cage yet,got this for my hampster. He was able to get over and get out 8 times. He was able to lift the water bottle out and the trays seem to fit not at all:( worst consept ever
1,High shipping costs yet takes forever to arrive,"At my 9 year old neighbor's request I ordered a hamster cage for her-one that she's been saving up for all summer. I paid over $9.00 for shipping, since it wasn't available for Prime members. 10 days later, and no cage. We were told we'd get it in 3-5 days, but, again, it's been 10 days and I see that it's in the Midwest...we are in Oregon. So, I'm not sure if we'll have to wait another 10 days for it to get here, but my poor neighbor is terribly sad that the cage isn't here, since she was hoping to get her hamster over the weekend.I order a lot, online, and haven't come across such sloppy business - well, ever.I know that I'll never do business with this company again, and I urge you not to trust Rollstone Fulfillment, either. They've done nothing but break a young girls heart.Michelle,Portland, OR"
4,Super Pet Critter Trail 2 Level Habitat,"My daughter loves this cage and so does our newest addition Pipsqueak. It takes a little getting use to to take apart to clean but we have not had any problems. You do have to be careful taking the tubes off. My husband and I cleaned it in 15 minutes while the kids watched the hamster. We have a dwarf hamster and she fits fine in the tubes but a regular size hamster would not. We have not added anything on yet, but we just received some new additions we purchased from Amazon. Enjoy!"
3,Hamster Home,"Its a really great fun habitat.The only thing i don't like is taking it a part to clean it.It seems easy sometimes but instead of the top coming off easily, it sometimes would come apart and then you would have to put it back.But then its how you would clean it and what you would you use on the bottom."
1,Cheaply Made,The shelves never stayed in place properly. Also the plastic breaks fairly easily. Not happy.Edited 5/12/10 -- Still not happy with the cage but I was able to do some fixes to make it more stable. I drilled 4 small holes in the lid - 2 on front and 2 on back - and wire tied the top to the wire cage. I did the same thing on the side pieces. This makes it very stable. I'm able to clean the cage very easily by removing the top.
4,Hitachi loves it,I received the cage pretty fast. My hamster loves the cages. he's a lil fat though so watching him squeeze through the tubes is kinda funny. His last cage had a sky deck wheel and instead of using it to exercise he would sleep and store food in it. Too messy for my liking. This cage is perfect. Putting it together was a little difficult. Connecting the wire parts together proved to be a challenge but at the end the cage is very sturdy and pretty.**** VERY DIFFICULT to unattach bottom to clean it.
1,Very time consuming to clean,"I have to agree with the others regarding the cleaning. You can't just ""remove the bottom"" -> in doing so the entire cage falls apart. You then clean each part separately then enjoy putting the puzzle back together. Looks great once cleaned and the hamsters love playing around in it, but next time will be looking for something both fun for the hamsters and easier to clean."
4,A pretty Decent Cage,"this cage is actually good, despite other peoples comments. assembly and cleaning takes only minutes- ive had this for a few weeks and there have been no problems, but my hamster has escaped a few times. this can be easily solved by using twist ties to secure the door."
2,Won't contain my teddy bear hamster!,"1st time Hamster owner. This habitat was a pain to put together, even my husband struggled with assembling it. No way am I taking it apart to clean it! I just vacuum out the bottom bedding and the petting zoo comes out to clean that. The wheel is already too small for my syrian and we just got it! She never runs on it. She's already broken out twice! She managed to twist the petting zoo cap 'til it unlocked and slither out. We've had to duck tape the top which means we can't plug the petting zoo with that cap anymore. Also, I am afraid the latches on the petting zoo will break because I frequently get her out up there to get to her. I'm already looking for a better, more sturdy cage. Wouldn't recommend this although my sister isn't having any problem with the exact same cage for her panda bear hamster. This isn't a good cage for aggressive, energetic hamsters."
2,Not good for GERBILS,"I bought this for my two male gerbils a few months ago when we first got them. They have already chewed the exercise wheel (unusable), one of the blue tunnels and both of the red platforms - one of them is missing a side and the blue tunnel can no longer stay attached. I will never buy another chewable cage for a gerbil again - I'll be buying a more practical glass aquarium ASAP....before they chew themselves free!"
5,Love this habitat!,"This is one of the best critter trails I could find at such a reasonable price from Petco. It is great for larger hamsters like syrian, teddy bear, and black bear. They love to climb through the tunnels and run even on top of the wheel (if you set it up exactly like the picture). I do recomend getting a different water bottle. Cleaning is a snap.... Here's my secret. Buy two! Always have one clean and ready to use for the following week. It really is a lot less stress that way. This way you can take your time taking apart, cleaning and puting back together the soild one. Plus its nice to have extra parts. Especially an extra wheel to change out in the middle of the week when it gets a little messy (they like to run and pee at the same time)."
2,Wonderful Concept,"Kudo's on the concept. My son was really thrilled to see this show up on the doorstep. It was a nightmare to assemble. He tried to assemble it first, and then I was left to complete the assembly. One piece arrived broken, so we needed to contact the manufacturer. They were nice, and sent out a replacement part with no cost to me. The Gerbils really loved the product. Apparently they really love the taste of the two red ""second floor platforms"". Woke up one day to each of them being partially eaten. It is more difficult to clean this cage than the other one that we have. We are back to using the old cage, and this one is now in the basement... relegated to the pile of ""seemed like a good idea at the time"" purchases. It hit that pile in record time. Good luck with your experience with this item."
3,Too small & breakable,"Habitat is unique and colorful, though is cheaply made and breaks easily as others have stated. We used extreme care and patience when putting together, yet several pieces still broke off. Also, this habitat is too small for our Teddy Bear Hamster. The tubes are too narrow and the wheel is not large enough for him to run. Would be a better option for small mice or gerbils. We appreciate the Free shipping, as we will need to purchase a larger and more sturdy habitat for our furry friend."
4,Love and hate it,"My hamster and I love the cage, because it has alot more room for him to play and sleep. One of the problems I have with the product is that it is not so easy to clean, haven't quite figured out the best way to do this, without taking it apart. Loft is great for him to stay in while I am cleaning. I would like to see if they can make one that the bottom slides out, like a bird cage does. My second problem with the cage is that I don't know how that tube attachment at the bottom(one that goes to the loft) got broke. The wheel outside atttachment broke the first day I got the cage."
4,hamster cage,hamster seems to hide at the top with his head down the hole. Kinda sucks.. want to get more canals to see if he'll move around more. Otherwise good.
2,Too small,This cage was way too small for my regular size hamster. He got stuck in the tubes. I had to return it and purchase another cage. Very disappointed as it was a really nice set up. It should be be labeled for dwarf hamsters only.
5,Awesome cage!,"Very good cage, Plastic quality could be better, but over all. GREAT CAGE.Keep ONE thing in mind. Be VERRRY gentle when putting it together. Do not attempt to force parts together. The cage will get mad and snap/crackle and pop.I was so afraid that my hamster would chew the cage bars...but to my surprise...he never did... (so far...) >_<Anyways, great product. AND THE PRICE, OH, THE PRICE!!! AMAZON IS THE BEST! NO SHIPPING!!!! :) Since it's over $25. (by $1.75)Buy this cage!"
3,Hope you have fat mice!,"My daughter got this for her birthday. It is a bit of a pain to clean out because you basicly have to take it apart! Thats not the worst part! She has pet mice. First, I had to put the mice in a different cage and fatten them up before I could put them in this cage. They would just push right through the bars of the cage. The bars are too wide apart. I thought it was just around the door at first, then I seen one of the mice crawling through a random spot on the side. I have to check daily to see if the mice are still in the cage. Other than that, it is nice and roomy. Assembly is not that hard, but it gets aggrivating have to reassemble every time you wanna clean it out good."
2,Poor Engineering,"This cage LOOKS awesome. The gerbils enjoy it. These are the good qualities. The bad are: the plastic bottom and the clips break very easily. When you buy the cage, you have to put it together and the pieces don't exactly fit very well. There are gaps and junctions where you have to just accept that metal and hard plastic pieces just aren't going to snap tightly together. It's fragile and easily falls apart as a consequence. The plastic should be a sturdier more pliable plastic--the kind that is not see-through--at least for the base which has to hold all the other pieces in place. I don't look forward to cleaning it. Had I bought this at a brick & mortar store, I would've returned it, but I'm not messing with shipping."
1,Utter dreck. Terrible depiction of Thor.,"This debacle of an animated feature portrays Thor in a horrible light. After watching this (thankfully for free via my local library), I did a bit of 'net research and discovered that some of the folks involved in the making of this cartoon are huge Hulk fans who delighted in Thor's pounding. Listening to the commentary confirmed this.Just a bad, bad story. It would have been so much more interesting if the two main characters had a draw.The THOR film's success at the box office offers overwhelming evidence that Thor is a very appealing, marketable, and profitable character. More so than the big green oaf by far. Now if those in charge at Marvel get it through their thick skulls that this is the case, things will be better for comic fans and humanity. ;)"
3,A PG-13 cartoon on the Hulk that's the lesser of two evils,"My son loves the hulk so I've been trying to get cartoons for my son to watch. I saw that this was a cartoon, and got it for him. My son loves to watch it, but I noticed it's particularly violent, and the violence is a bit excessive. If you don't mind your child watching PG-13 violence vs G or PG violence, this dvd will be okay for you, but if you don't want your child to watch PG-13 violence, I would not recommend having your child watch this dvd. From my perspective, I enjoy my son watching Planet Hulk more which is also a PG-13 film, but at least the Hulk grows in character in that film. Here all he does is attack, attack, attack, and fight, fight, fight. That's good for kids, but not always the best way you want your child to learn to act as a parent. Still compared to what's out there for your kids to watch, sometimes PG-13 is the lesser of two evils."
5,cantstoplearning,Fantastic book- I was on a road trip through Oregon when I found it- it's a book you can pick up and read at any point and it will still be quite interesting. No kidding - I came home and bought three more to give to friends and family! This book is an obvious labor of love by the author.
5,An excellent children's book with beautiful illustrations,"A lyrical, beautifully written story which captures the imagination of children and adults. The writing is so wonderfully descriptive that you can taste the sweet and sour appleas and hear the sound of the cricket. This story was one of my favorites, as a child, and now it is a favorite of my nieces and nephews."
4,country story,"Jay is a young man who enjoys his country life. In the picture book we join his as he explores the country side where he lives. On his adventures he finds a cricket and decides to keep him. He has to start school soon and decides to take him to class with him. The cricket starts to make his noise and the teacher lets Jay share the cricket for show and tell.The book showed that even bugs can be good pets. It was a little long for a picture book and kids might have a hard time sitting still through the whole story.I would recommend this book for kids ages 6-10. Kids who enjoy country life will identify well with the main character, Jay"
4,Slick!,"This CD is full of good music but my favorite is Lake Shore Drive. It is sooo slick and smooth. You can listen to this one song for about an hour, easy. Buy this CD and invite some friends over for dinner. You will get so many compliments on your taste in music. Brian McNight and Laylah Hathaway only compliments Art's talent. If you are just getting into buying smooth jazz, you will love this CD."
3,No plot,"I've never read anything by Will Self, so I had no preconceptions going in. I thought the premise sounded interesting and some of the reviews I encountered on this site made the book appear promising.Briefly, the writing is brilliant. The book is filled with insightful thoughts. The descriptions of the dead and how they live are intense, and quite gruesome. The concept is inventive, to say the least.Let's see, what's wrong with the book? Oh, that's right. No plot! This book is really a great piece of descriptive imagination. It's powerful and fascinating. I just don't really understand what the point of fiction is, however, unless it also includes some semblance of a plot.I wish I had read ALL the reviews more carefully before reading How The Dead Live. It gave me everything that was promised, but a lot less as well."
4,in the end I couldn't put this book down,"I wrote a first, relatively negative review of this book and realized only afterwards that I had been shocked by the lack of sentimentalism, rather than by a lack of feelings in this book about death (my excuse is that as a cancer patient myself I had a hard time reading about somebody dying of cancer described with so little compassion). But, I have to admit that Will Self writes beautifully and that -- in an English way -- he does explore the depth of the human heart. I read in it a message about how in the end we do choose our life."
4,Good but...,Why do booksellers insist on putting HUGE impossible to remove stickers on the books? Would have been a five start otherwise.
2,Depressing,"Well, I said I would pass on this author but since I bought two together, I decided to read. Although I found the writing amazing...one really has to study his words...I constantly had to look things up..(that's good, by the way), in the end I guess it just went on too long - the first half of the book concerns the woman who is dying, her relationships with her children and various men, all with brutal honesty and I enjoyed that. The second half I struggled through. I mean once you can adapt to the idea that the dead are really ""living"" on the other side, the way these spirits roam around doing essentially nothing....was just too too far for me to get into. I finally gave it up about 3/4 of the way into the book."
2,Promise Unfulfilled,"As a fan of Will Self I was deeply disappointed by his latest novel. I have admired his acidic prose and thought that Collections such as The Grey Zone, and Tough Tough Toys for ... Boys was equally brilliant. The novel I most enjoyed was Great Apes. Will Self seems to write best when he adopts an analytical tone that goes beyond weird. The works of his that I most dislike, such as this one, suffer from a lack of self-control. This book degenerates into a thinly disguised rant against the things that Self most dislikes about the modern world. The most irritating feature is the profligate use of the ""f"" word that is always a cheap trick to substitute for the lack of substance. The orginal plot idea was great - the execution isn't. I'm glad I borrowed this one from the library."
1,Unreadable garbage,"Yes, he's clever. Yes, it's one big rant. But do we really want to waste our time reading several hundred pages of it? I don't. It perhaps would be acceptable as a short story but this book is unreadable. No plot, no dialogue that makes any sense, no descriptions a normal person could relate to; skip it. Mr. Self seems very proud of his famous drug-influenced reputation and he needs to get a clue. What makes for a good newspaper story about a writer with serious self-esteem problems does not make that writer's work good.He's capable of much better. Let's wait until he writes something worth reading, this is not."
5,Love This!,I have family & friends who love to travel and this provides a lot of choices for making the perfect gift. The patterns are simple and easy to follow and she provides guidelines to make your own sampler. They are also easily accomplished in a short span of time.
4,A great book!,"A.J. Quinell is probably one of the best at writing about international enigma...He knows the places, he develops characters well, summarizing, he is an excellent author. The book deals with a complot to kill the Pope, and possible KGB involvement, but you get to meet two great character, a nun and a defectant polish soldier who are thrown in the middle of the problem. I highly recommend it."
5,A flawless thriller,"This book truly is a diamond in the ruff. It seems to be hard to find, but if you can find it, then by all means, buy it immediately! Quinnell has given us a fantastic, intriguing story that takes into the heart of the bleak world that is the pre-1989 communist bloc. The characters are vividly fleshed out, and Mr Quinnell gives a virtual clinic in character development. Although the afformentioned development was a bit predictable, it was fantastic nonetheless. Read this book!"
5,Ambler did it best,"Ordinarily, I don't read thrillers, but since this was one of my mother's favorite books, I thought I would give it a try. What a surprise!Instead of some overblown macho stud like James Bond, the protagonist is Charles Latimer, a quiet English academic, who becomes intrigued by the death of an arch-felon, Dimitrios Makropoulos. He decides to find out more about this Dimitrios, and winds up traversing Europe from Istanbul to Paris.There are no gimmicks in Ambler's writing; he presents a mystery and unravels it. Supposedly, Ambler is responsible for the ""modern"" spy thriller. If so, he did it well, but the genre devolved after him. A Coffin for Dimitrios is a superb book whether it is classified a mystery, thriller, or whatever."
3,A Coffin for Demetrios,"I found a certain fascination with the serpentine meanderings of the plot as the protaginist made his way through the pre-World War Two Balkans on his way to Geneva and Paris searching for information on a criminal recently fished out of the Bosperous by Turkish authorities. Unfortunately Ambler spent too much space on recapitulating the shabby activities of Demetrios and the low-life history associated with him: Drug running, prostitution, even political assassination, but all this was largely in the shady past. Often the novel dragged. I wonder if Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre did much to enliven the movie version known by the British title, ""A Mask for Demetrios."""
5,A Classic!,"The back cover blurb by Graham Greene hails Ambler as 'Our greatest thriller writer."" Tall praise from one of the greatest mystery writers. And well deserved. There are more twists and turns in this novel than there are in an Alpine road, with Ambler enticing his reader to try to anticipate the next one. He was always a curve or two ahead of me, so I enjoyed it thoroughly!"
3,A Little Too Improbable To Completely Satisfy,"In this engaging classic mystery set in pre-WWII Europe an English writer of mysteries happens upon an interesting story of a Greek career criminal recently found dead. To amuse himself and procrastinate from beginning his next book, he decides to attempt to reconstruct this criminal's path across southern Europe over the previous 15 years. He soon discovers that his idle exercise has elicited the attention of a mysterious man, who is apparently also interested in the career of this criminal. The path goes back in time to such lurid things as political assassination, white slavery, heroin rings, and blackmail. There is a big surprise late in the book (which shouldn't be much of a surprise at all) and a satisfying ending. While the plot is high on the improbable scale it is considered one of the fathers of the modern spy novel and is worth reading for that reason alone."
4,A Good Spy Story,I have read Journey into Fear also written by Eric Ambler which was excellent and looked forward to reading A Coffin for Dimitrios. I was not disappionted.If you want to read a book filled with devious and amoral characters then this is it.
3,...,"I actually reviewed this book below, but wanted to add that the book was made into a good movie in the 1940's starring Peter Lorre titled THE MASK OF DIMITRIOS, now available on video."
4,historically interesting,"OK, this is a little creaky for a modern audience- making a guy a professor-turned-mystery-writer and explaining his nosiness with this simply won't fly- but clearly this book is a direct ancestor of the modern political thriller- certainly Graham Greene must have read it before writing ""The Third Man"". It's very well done and its picture of 30's Balkan politics is very enjoyable. It's perfect airport reading."
4,"Entertaining read, hard to find in book stores","It took a long time to find this book. It's never in used book stores. I finally broke down and bought it online. Good story. Mr. Ambler does fine character development and builds suspense without unnecessary violence or profanity. Following Latimer across Europe in search of Dimitrios was unnerving at times. I don't, however, see how Latimer being the person who runs down Dimitrios' story is 'absurd'. Latimer's interactions with the various people who knew Dimitrios were interesting and moved quite logically. Overall, I'm glad I finally read this classic."
4,Fine early spy novel,"A writer of detective fiction becomes fascinated by the sketchy details surrounding the life of a real criminal and decides to learn the truth for himself as a professional, intellectual exercise. He will learn far more than he bargained for. Though it builds slowly, lacking a real sense of danger for much of its length, Eric Ambler's fine writing and deft character work held my interest, as did his abilities as a guide through Europe on the eve of World War II."
3,Drug dealers in Europe.,"Slow paced and calm by today's thriller standards, but I was fascinated with the European illegal drug industry."
2,"Diverting, but not particularly well-written","The book jacket references that Ambler is the precursor to the works of people like Len Deighton and Robert Ludlum. Now I understand why I don't care for the work of the latter two writers -- A Coffin for Dimitrios is somewhat diverting, but the premise is a reach and the writing never rises above 'adequate'."
2,I Must Be Missing Something...,"This book left me very unsatisfied. Most reviewers here hail the book as a ""classic"" and magnificent thriller, and many seem to feel that since Ambler is the ""father of the modern spy thriller"" they are duty-bound to beatify this work. I'll take a modern spy author any day. True, the plot moves steadily forward, the characters are fascinating and well-drawn, and the descriptions of pre-war Central Europe are delicious. But the book seems to move like a train -- you get on, you look out the window at the passing landscape, and then you get off. There was little if any excitement; the suspense was tepid; the plot turned on convenient contrivances aimed only at enabling the author to keep the book moving. The ending, to me, was naive and left me saying: ""Is that all there is???"" Like I say, in the face of all the rave reviews, I must be missing something."
2,Disappointing,"I read in a piece on Ian Fleming, Eric Ambler's claim that ""Ian Fleming should be read as literature."" The writer of the piece then added that this was high praise since, ""Eric Ambler may be the greatest thriller novelist of them all, with A COFFIN....his finest."" So I had to check COFFIN out. And it was not even close to the finest thriller I've ever read. The plot is thin, and strung together. Granted, the writing itself is good, but it didn't accumulate into a satisfying whole. Not nearly. I'll stick to Frederick Forsythe thrillers."
1,Not worth the cost.,"Yeah, it's a rare book that has only been out of print for 110 years. Congrats and thanks for bringing it back.There is so much missing text and typos that the paperback is unreadable. Admittedly there was a warning that this version will have typos and missing text.The original had numerous illustrations - this is one of the things that made the original a sought after reference. None of them are present - again, this was noted in the item description. What wasn't noted is that the illustrations are also not present in the online version to which you get access by purchasing the paperback, and that several pages are for no apparent reason blank - which makes reading the entire text online problematic.Save your money. Do not buy this version of ""Hanging in Chains."""
2,Great writer-This one missed the mark,"Love Don Winslow. Every other book I've read by him I could not put down. As another reviewer mentioned, once this story left the states to China, the book got very slow, to the point I just stopped reading and moved on to the 3rd Neal Cary book. I should say that China and Chinese history do not interest me, and that was not at all what I expected from a Don Winslow book after reading the first Neal Cary book, and others like Savages, Bobby Z, Frank the Machine, Dawn Patrol, Kings of Cool etc..(All of these books I would highly recommend). I'm hoping the third Neal Cary book is more along the lines of the first one, but we will see."
5,Great storytelling,"I really liked this book. Winslow does a good job of taking a simple story and building it into a larger framework. This time it has to do with the burgeoning agriculture industry in China. A China coming out of the ravages of the ""Great Revolution."" Winslow does a good job of keeping his story together in the midst of such a bigger picture playing out."
3,Good writer----very average story.,"This chase takes place in California, Hong Kong and China. While in California I found it quite a good ride.As soon as it left these shores and went to Hong Kong and China it grounded to nearly a halt for me. It got very heavy on travelogue and way too much on the poilitics of the region. These boring passages only accentuated the preposterous situations the protagonist got in and out of.I did like Neal Carey and some of his support team. Mr. Winslow's writing style was fine and I will try another Neal Carey, but will make certain it takes place in the USA.This could be an enjoyable series and lead character, but the setting for this book just bored me beyond words. If you care about China and its politics it's probably a big winner."
2,Mediocre,"Style is ok, but fabric is so thin it tends to cling to outer garments, ribbon straps need to be a little wider."
4,Star Struck!,This is a very big upgrade from my sampson G-track. I love how the cardioid pattern only picks up the sounds i want to. Very nice mic. Get it!!
4,The Cad GXL 2200,I read about the CAD GXL 2200 Microphone from a [...]. It is a microphone that is not too expensive and has a great sound.
5,Son loves this!,My son and his friends have used this to make and record music and my son loves this! He would buy it again!
3,Cad Mic,"This is my first condenser microphone I have ever bought so when my package arrived I was very pleased to receive it. The first day my mic arrived it appear to work fine. I mean it was a big step up from the built in input I have been using. However there are I few complaints I do have with this mic. For one it gives a tremendous amount of fuzziness, which greatly effects the recording. Secondly, upon receiving it, the mic felt very loose at the top. Lastly, when I record my vocals appear to be dominant on one side. Now I'm not sure if condenser mics are supposed to operate this way or I just received a faulty mic."
4,Pretty Good,"This microphone is decent, probably the best for its price. Tweak the eq and the compressor, you will get a very decent sound via this mic.I used this for saxophone, vocal, and other instruments. Works great in all of them. Loving the way it looks.But the shockmount is cheaply made, but fairly reliable."
5,Great for the buck,"This mic is one of the best mics I've had so far. Works perfect with AA or Pro tools. Great for a small vocal studio/home studio. For all musicians looking for a good upgrade, this is the mic for you, Great crisp sound with low noise( practically no noise).the mic is worth every penny you will not be disappointed."
4,It's pretty good for beginning/intermediate projects,"I am just an amateur musician who does small projects at home for school and other activities on occasion, and this microphone is great for just such a thing. It offers a clear sound that most people would look for in a good microphone, and the quality is very nice.Few complaints:-The shock mount is horrible. If you're planning on getting this microphone, also plan on buying a separate shock mount for it, because the one that comes with the package has terrible, loose screw mounts [it got stripped after I tried to tighten it a little bit].-The microphone seems to pick up more highs than lows. It may also have to do with my particular recording techniques, but I've never really had this problem with my other microphone, the Shure SM-57. It seems to be more sensitive to highs than lows. If you get this microphone, experiment around with it a bit."
2,Didn't work,I gave this product a 2 star because the product did not work. I returned this product. My brother wanted this mocrophone because he records music often. I think he needed another component to make it work because it appeared to be in great condition. If another part is needed I think the seller should recommend what item(s) should be purchased wwith it.
2,"for the price, a cheap barely condenser mic","it works as a condenser...lot of barrel like noise inside...which means the model 3000 above it,is quite a bit better...butif you can find this mic for less than usd 80it is quite ok for vocal, ( must TWEAK EQ a lot tho)and acoustic bass or guitar or cello, etc..again, MUST tweak eq to reduce 100 to 1000 hz range,and increase the above 4k range...in order to make it sound acceptable for semi decent recording...from the eq tweaks u now get the ideaof how this thing sounds...it is ok... just barely acceptable..u want better, then get a GAP fc 4.not much tweaking ncessary but beware of QC probs...tooso get from a really good dealer who can give u a new oneif the fc4 u got, overloads or got too much noise eh.thanksand hv fun."
1,poor,well i bought this monday and bought a usb xlr and the mic dont record or nun so its poor in my eyes
3,not enough stomach,"I don't know what the director had in mind with this picture, but he sure as hell might have wanted to disgust the viewers. The atmosphere is depressive, with the main character being reminded all the time that he's a has-been. Personally, I would choose another guy to play this part. Anyway, from the other characters , the most convincing performance is the boy's.The soundtrack is quite good too.However, I couldn't go past the scene of the dog. I hate cruelty to animals, and that was too much to bear. Maybe the movie got better after that, but I'll probably never know. I'm sorry, because this movie could have been much better to my taste. I gave it 3 stars for the overall quality, but the way it makes you feel actually deserves only 2."
2,What a rip off,"It may play well in Hoboken, and get great (very limited) reviews but I found the film not worth the time nor the money! While the acting was quite good, the continuity of the story line was less acceptable."
5,Wire Harness did the trick,I wanted to replace the factory cassette radio in my 1999 Subaru Forester with a new radio that supports the iPod. I connect each wire from the harness to the corresponding wire on the new radio by color using closed end connectors. Then I plugged the harness into the car connector and the new radio works great!
4,Like Stepping Back In Time!,"It's wonderful that we can hear a 50 year old Paris concert by this legendary group. It's unfortunate that we had to sit too close to the drum kit and can't move for a better sound mix. But that is a minor distraction usually. I gave this 4 stars because there are better choices if you're just going to own one (or two). But if you might enjoy re-living a magical night in Paris, where The Jazz Messengers thrilled the crowd, this French CD will do the trick. (Note: Cover art and label are not as shown in illustration)."
2,Save your money,Most of the information in this book is common sense. Saying that all pregnancies are different and that juggling two (or more) kids is a challenge isn't exactly earth shattering news. Very few of the subjects in this book are really explored in depth. I agree with the reviewer who said this book is like something you'd expect from a magazine. It hits on several good topics but doesn't really say a lot about any of them. I got more out of re-reading the books I had with my first pregnancy. This book felt like a waste of time. I don't really think it's worth the money.
1,A very negative book all together,"Not only is this negative about being a parent for the second time it's very anti-breastfeeding and anti-natural birth. I basically says that pregnant nursing and tandem nursing is a bad idea. At one point 4 of the 5 nursing ""personal accounts"" are very negative. In the breastfeeding vs. formula section she completely fails to mention that breastmilk is full of nutrients that cannot be duplicated by formula. I'm not a breastfeeding fanatic but the book was in no way even handed with the way that it was treated.The entire book is very passive aggressive and at one point made me feel like I was being a bad mom, until I snapped out of it. This is what she says about choosing a nurse-midwife. ""If you think not using all the technology available would represent poor care of your unborn child, then choosing a midwife is probably not advised."" pg. 25I will be returning it for something a little more fairly presented."
3,Magazine Material,"This book was about what I'd expect from a magazine; not much in depth information, and not many creative ideas for dealing with subsequent pregnancies/children. (This book isn't just about your second pregnancy; it also addresses third and fourth, etc.) It needs an update from the 1995 publishing date; apparently at that time there was no chickenpox vaccine. I rolled my eyes at the authors matter-of-fact statement that women have a 50-50 chance of having a girl or boy. Tell that to the family of 7 sisters that lived up the street from me when I was a kid."
2,not great,"I decided to give this book the benefit of the doubt anyways even though the reviews weren't great. The testimonials were interesting but not much else. And I don't usually write reviews but I had to chime in because: CAREFUL with the medical info in this book! It seemed outdated and erroneous in more than one section. I have gestational diabetes and the information she gives in that section was flat out wrong. You don't have to give yourself insulin shots anymore (there are pills) and sometimes it can't be controlled with a very strict diet (because of genetic predisposiiton). Also it made it seem like epidurals are some sort of amazing new technology...uhh welcome the future, lady?! It really made me question the validity of the other information in the book.All in all it felt like a bunch of anecdotal information threaded together and not backed up by much recent fact or research. And hey, I can get that kind of info on the internet for free!"
3,I was disappointed,"I was really hoping this would get into meaty situations like ""oh my god I have vericose veins there because....?"" It skimmed the surface of many areas I was interested in, and went deeper into topics I didn't care about. I would suggest going to the library before buying this one."
2,For second time working moms,"I did not really enjoy this book because alot of it did not apply to me since this time around I will be a stay at home mommy. For the price I paid for the book, it has earned its collection of dust."
5,I couldn't put this down,"This is a brave, dark, unflinching page-turner, like no other book I've ever read -- excruciatingly honest, beautifully written, occasionally acerbic and always revealing. Deserves a wide audience and acclaim, and will certainly win both."
5,What a ride!,"Massage? Far from it. Erotic, funny, disturbing, sad -- this book grabs and doesn't let go."
2,Down with Chloe Perlemuter!,"Bad, bad, bad...If this DVD is part of my collection is because Thomas Hampson was announced as part of the cast. Well, stars are not so important, so I watched the production. And there is the awful work of a director named Chloe Perlemuter. She don't know nothing about opera, Wagner, movies, tv shows.... in one word: direction. Sorry about this production of Tannhäuser because the music and the singers are terrific... and maybe the sets, but is difficult to say so with a camera like Perlemuter's."
3,Horrible TV Direction!!!!!!!!!,"I have to ENDORSE 100% all reviews finding the TV Direction apsolutely unberable.Yoy get the impression that the director is infatuated with the face of Mr.Seifert.But although his singing and acting is quite good the constant focus on his face does him no good at all.It is also insulting for the rest of the cast to be heard singing and not seen almost at all.There is not a single shot of the whole stage, so one misses completely the impact of the stage production and the scenery.This is a pity,particularly because wagnerian opera is not only singing but a total theatrical endeavor.I think that someone should only listen to this recording and not view it, since there is some good singing involved and the orchestra plays excellent.Hope we will not see any such TV production again!!!!"
2,I will throw it at the waste,"It have a big and anacceptable mistake: The people appear dressede about the XIX - XX century. The people must be dressed as in the XIII century as say at the libretto of Wagner.Please let me know if I can get of Tannhauser (Dresden version) where de oberture is played complete. The Paris version wasmade for the proper Wagner, in this the oberture is cut at he end and colaesce with the bachenale, in my opinion, a big mistake made for the proper Wagner."
1,I'm pretty easy to please but........,"Man, is this a bad movie! I mean really, really bad. At the beginning I kept waiting for the punchline because I couldn't believe this was really the movie. It' pretty hard to waste $3.50 on a movie rental but this DVD manages it handily."
5,whats with all these reviews?,"honestly i would rate this movie a 3, but i just did 5 to tilt the average review grade up a little. the acting wasnt the best in the world, but you cant have such high expectations on a low budget movie. all of these reviews that say this movie is bad (but not all of them) seem biased. i guess this movie is a hate it or love it movie. regardless, you should rent this movie and see for yourself. but what you have to remember is that this is a low budget movie so dont have high budget expectations."
3,Dax stole the show,"This movie reminds me so much of all the Saturdays I spent (probably before most of the reviewers were even born) at matinees of Sci-Fi/horror movies - and for the budget they had they've done a fairly good job. That said, there are dead giveaways as to who are the ""bad guys"" that seem to be taken straight from other movies - the sugar fix and the cracking neck.Richard Burgi in his characterization of Capt. Dax steals the show, and as planned, I'm sure, by the writer and director carries forth the anti-war message to perfection.Not a great, super-budget Sci-Fi extravaganza, but definitely effective in getting it's point across."
1,JUST ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE...,"I can only say....don't pick it up, rent it, buy it, borrow it, or steal it.....it is so horrible and painful to watch I nearly cried. I believed they'd just killed a franchise I learned to love since first watching the animated series. I can't say anything else about this trash....."
1,Short and Sweet,"Let's keep it short...the entire product of the film (Sound, Direction, Acting, Casting, Editing) all felt like it was done by a high school film student with some of his buddys. Save your money and more importantly, save the fraction of your life of watching this movie for time watching a good movie. Because you will never get the time back that you wasted watching this movie."
2,weird movie,its a cheaply made movie. bad acting. the only reason it sells is for the movie name. i dont reccomend
1,Really Bad,"Ok....as a SciFi fan, #1 was an A.....but this one is a D......when you average all four movies...you end up with a B to B-.....so unless you are a collector...don't waist you money...."
1,suc.... ie,"I saw this on Action TV this month, not worth your time or money!!!!!!!!!! Unless it is a lot different then the Sat version !!!!!!!!!! Lame excuse for a a Starship Troopers movie the animated versions are better !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,The worst sequel ever.,I strongly urge anyone who's looking to get this movie to pleeease forget about it.It's a major disappointment and you'ed be better off just pretending it don't exist.
3,the people who made part i didnt make this,"this one wasnt anywhere as close to as good as the stellar first part.they hang out in a little base in a hole the whole time!it was a monumental letdown.nobody important was in it.no one important from the first one showed up here either.its too bloody for the kids.i miss the sexy ass red head from part 1.this is more of a drama than the action packed original.it actualy even looks more low budget too.its likeable in itself.but as part of a ongoing sequence its the part of the line graph that goes spiraling downward to a dismal end.theres not even any memorable chicks!i guess they could make a third part but if they do,theyd better get the writers back from part 1."
1,don't waste your time!,"I really wish Amazon has a zero star rating... This has to be the WORST sequel ever made. Even a sequel to Ishtar would be better. Zero plot, bottom of the barrel B-list actors (and C-list acting to boot!) and a buck-twenty budget on a set that resembles a junkyard does not make for impressive viewing. What makes matters worse they use an actress who was in the first film - whose character (the Fleet Captain) died in ST1!Please don't buy this - even when it is going for 99c..."
3,Not a bad movie and not a good movie.,"I don't think the movie was that bad, but then again I was also in the special olipmics last year and I won two events."
3,"not too good, but dang, I watched the whole thing","My buddy let me borrow Starship Troopers 2. I plopped down on the sofa while my wife was off somewhere w/the kids and expected to watch the first 5 mins. and jump to various other scenes. but ya know what? The film kept my attention(okay that may not be saying a lot!).It's predictable, low-budget and awfully acted with heavy shades of the aliens franchise and Pitch Black influences strewn around, but i kinda enjoyed it.the second half is definitely a gorefest with the lamest sequence being the 'itsy bitsy spider' scene......just lame.I also was really grossed out by the facehuggers/throat divers. Ugh. those fat little abdomens and spindly legs just creeped me out.Based on the fact that it made me squirm i bumped it up a star.Okay, where's my Critrerion copy of Wages of Fear. Time for some great viewing."
2,Not the worst movie I've seen,"The story itself is not bad... but the execution stinks. Poor imitations of the first movies ""do you want to know more?""The acting was decent and once the story got started it was somewhat interesting.If you really look you'll see an actor from the first film.Overall, this is a movie for the hard core fans only... and thats just because it says Starship Troopers"" on the box."
1,Scrofulus excreta of a diseased skunk,"The original ST was merely a bad rendition of the book, but this garbage combines the worst of bad script, incredibly stupid dialog and anti-war fantasy. In this version the bad guys are human war-mongers, the bugs are just an excuse to show what a disgusting civilization we have. This movie stinks so bad that you will have to burn your clothes if you go near it."
4,better than i thought!!!,"I think this was a very good sequal, no better than the first but still good. Yeah it was some what low-grade, but then again that is what starship troopers the movies are about, cheap, some bad lines and korny,but you gotta get it in order to watch this movie and have fun. I liked it a lot and was very impressed, i figured the movie out pretty quick but the gore and weirdness of the movie got my approval. If you want to sit back and watch a fun movie, this is it!"
2,Complete Disappointment.,"I'd say that the original was a pretty good movie. I know a lot of people didn't like it, but I did. It was good because you got to see the cadets as they went from friends, to the academny, to the battle. You got to know them, and you wanted to see what happened to them.The second one does none of that. You don't get to know any of the characters, and therefore when they die, you don't care.I know it was a ""low budget"" film, but low budget doesn't have to mean ""stupid story"". They seemed to have enough money to make all the bugs and all that stuff, couldn't they have also invested in a decent script?This one was a complete waste of time to watch. And the story seemed like something from ""The Outer Limits"", except the outer limits would have been better."
1,A good idea gone wrong.,"So I loved the first movie...and the cartoon was excellent, but this movie is worse than most low budget made for TV movies.There is nothing special about the effects. Some are good, but for the most part, they just look fake. I can't really find a plot line, the action sequences just sort of happen, followed by some nudity. The camera angles are horrible, and all the actors, if you can call them actors, don't seem to know where they are shooting. For the most part, they just walk around saluting at every opportunity. To top it all off, the music sounds like the director stole a CD of theme music and just started playing it in the background.I had high hopes for this movie, but don't expect anything like the first. Yeah, this one is no good. Sorry."
1,horrible!!,i too thought this was going to live up to its name.this was just about the weakest storyline ever in a sci-fi movie. do not waste your time.rent of buy anything else!gc.
2,STUPID MOVIE,"This move is so stupid. The special effects are not half as good as from starship troopers. Even the guns firing are special effects and it just looks stupid. Where are the huge bugs that fire lava? where are the bugs that fly? Since when are psyics in the infantry and in the field? and WHY DO YOU HAVE THE SAME ACTOR WHO PLAYED DENISE RICHARDS CAPTAIN IN STARSHIP TROOPERS AND WHO WAS KILLED, WHY DO YOU HAVE HER PLAY A CHARACTER IN THIS MOVIE? so stupid"
4,You have to know what you're watching,"You have to know that ST2 is a very low-budget film. Saying that, the set are below expectations but the acting is good, the animation is amazing (better than the first film), and the storyline is predictable but good. I enjoyed watching the film and plan on watching it again sometime in the future.It does not add to the storyline of the first film, it actually feels like it belongs more in the animated tv series than as a sequel to the film.If you don't like direct to video movies then this movie is not for you, but don't be afraid to give Starship Troopers 2 a chance."
2,Shame Shame Shame,"As the first movie slaps you around with great stuff, this sequeljust scratches a bit. My Gosh, with such a great movie, you wouldthink someone would write a good script for a sequel, but nooooothey went for the quick bucks again.........what a shame.This movie is worth watching at least once.....but you will getdepressed at the lack of surprises..."
2,"Really Bad Movie, I Like To Pretend That I Didn't See it!","No joking, this is a very bad movie and not worthy of being called ""Starship Troopers"". The original movie,Starship Troopers, was a great movie and very watchable. Don't waste your time on this one.Not recommended at all!"
3,This sequal was just ok,"I watched the ST1 and loved it. I thought, how bad can a sequal be? Ok, this was an ok sequal. It wasn't that exciting nor was it just plain bad. It is worth a watch, but keep your expectations down to nothing and come up from there. The casting wasn't that bad, the special effects were not that bad either. It was just a plain boring story. See it for yourself and make your own decisions."
1,Very Very disappointing,"I dont have a long essay to write but comparing to the first Starship Troopers, this was a very disappointing movie. It was nothing like the first movie. First of all the entire movie was during the night and so you never really get that true dvd like quality picture that was a part of the first movie. There was a lot of shooting blindly in the dark, most times you were not even sure that it was bugs they were shooting at. This has got to be the worst sequel yet. I am so hugely disappointed because I really enjoyed the first movie & was really looking forward to this one. Very very very very disappointed Starship Trooper fan."
2,Save your money,"Starship Troopers had a certain ""pulp cinema"" charm--even had bug-eyed monsters who wanted our women (for their brains even). The sequel is terrible. Virtually all the action happens on one set, the acting is bad, and the script is weak. It is actually simply a bad horror movie, not science fiction."
2,"Worth renting, not worth owning.","Honestly, I'm pretty easy going on movies. As long as it's entertaining, I'm game. So even tho this was a direct to video movie, I figured what the hell, give it a shot. Well, if you take out the few shots of the big bugs, someone would have to tell you your watching a Starship Troopers movie. Really, there is no resemblance to the first one so don't get your hopes up. It's not to bad for a low budget film, but unfortunately there's no mystery or suspense to it. All through it you know who's infected and you know what's going to happen. On the bright side tho, some of the acting was pretty decent, and the special effects were better then other low budget films, so if your looking for a simple no thought action flick, this is a renter at best. Just don't expect it to be anything like the original"
1,this movie really sucks,"This movie probably had hype considering it is a sequel to the great SST #1 until everyone found out it had probably the worst acting core and a budget so low that there can only be a few special effects scenes here and there.They seemed to want to change everything from the first film: no same actors, worse special effects,no flying bugs, no plasma-firing bugs, no fire bugs, and no brain bugs, oh and yeah the weapons are even different. And also one of the characters in the 2nd film was really the flight commander in the first who got cut in two by the sliding door but i dont think your suppose to know that.As for the dvd, they are barely any extra features worth looking at. All in all SST 2 sucks really bad."
1,Turn it off - PLEASE TURN IT OFF!,"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? HOW CAN YOU PEOPLE BE POOR EXCUSE FOR A MONEY GRABBING SEQUEL MORE THAN 1 STAR??!!I think we should start a petition to bring back the original cast (excluding dead members such as Dizzy, Zander and the captain of Carmens ship in SST1...who somehow came back to life as mobile infantry in this attrocious sequel - and then died again) and make a 'proper' sequel to a film which provided hours of pure brilliance.I dare you to watch every minute of this decrepid film.WHAT A TRAVESTY"
1,What... A piece... Of crap.,"Oh my God, I've never seen a worse movie. Pointless, stupid, idiotic, worthless, boring. I mean, the original wasn't great anyway, but it was still -good-. This was just.... Disgustingly bad."
1,Ridicule from friends,Hired this out last Saturday night with friends. Terrible. We watched it all just for the sake of the memory of SS 1 but was really a waste of time. Don't ruin your memories - don't rent or buy! See other reviews for why.
1,Almost wish I could give zero stars,"I am a fan of science fiction movies, and will watch even really lame ones with some enjoyment. However, I almost didn't make it all the way through this movie. The acting was decent and I wasn't bothered by the not-so-great special effects, but the story was just awful. It was basically Alien without the suspense and with much more gore. I don't have a weak stomach, but after a while it seemed that the close-ups of gore got a bit sadistic. On the other hand, close-ups of actors faces occasionally had the pixilated look of cheap video, which was distracting.Even if you loved the first movie, don't bother with this one."
2,Don't Watch This,"This movie did not meet the expectations that I had hoped for. While the first movie was terrific, this one was not. There is no Johnny Rico leading the Federation Infantry, which in my opinion doomed the movie from the start. I was disappointed in one aspect. In the first movie, when the guns were fired we saw bullet casings flying out. In this movie, they replace that with lights that flashed in the front, simulating it being fired. Were the bugs being taken down with invisible bullets?? The only good portion of the movie was the idea of the bigger, badder bug. Whereas the bug in the first movie was a brain sucker, these bugs invade the body and take over. This movie is not worth watching nor renting."
1,Barely Watchable,"This is barely watchable. The original ""Starship Troopers"" was creative, quirky, and graphically enticing. This is none of those. It is a poorly done sequel that just wants to empty the pockets of its viewers. The acting itself is not bad, but it is like being directed in a desperate fashion. Ugh."
1,bad movie,thought it was a cmplaite waist of time. compaires to battlefeald STINKS like last week trashhad to give it a single star but this web sight will not accept any thing lower this movie is a ( - 3 stars )
1,"A Shoddy ""Starship Troopers"" Sequel","It must have cost the filmmakers ten whole dollars to make this movie. I was blown away by the magnificent special effects and the peculiar acting, but, not really. ""Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation"" is a ripoff of many sci-fi films that John Carpenter domineered early in his career. A group of Federation soldiers are isolated in a command post surrounded by Arachnids (really big bugs) and an arrival of infected soldiers ruins their chances of survival. I am truly disappointed that this fine film did not get a theatrical release, but, not really. It's annoying, lousy, and ultimately boring. The gruesome spilling of beans from people tried to make up for the absence of the creatures, the true enemies. But, with a budget of ten dollars, they tried to act. Big mistake. A still motion home video of action figures fighting each other would have been more entertaining. Kelly Carlson should stick to ""Nip/Tuck"" and now, I'm done."
1,Terrible,"Those few people who rated this above 2 stars must have been on some kind of hallucinogen. They rehashed the Ships captain from the original movie ( The one that gets crushed under a door) and hoped we wouldn't notice. The First movie was excellent, but this was boring, poorly shot and poorly written. Fortunately Starship Troopers 3 is coming out soon and it seems promising."
1,NOT what I expected. Don't waste your $$,"I was a big fan of the ST1. The plot and characters were excellent, it rated up there with the best of them I would give ST1 5 stars. I saw this was on sale for a great price so I got it expecting great things. Usually sequels aren't to par with the originals so I at least expeted a 3-star movie. When i flipped on the movie i said ""WOW....right where they left off"" at a pretty good battle seen with the BUGS. Well, that was it I was waiting for more action. I waited....I waited...I waited and I waited...they made the plot intersting with occasional nudity but it still wasn't worth it. I don't know who's idea it was for the sequel but I hope this was their last one. I'll stick with the new Battlestar Galactic and Star Trek reruns."
1,Starship troopers 2,"How can I say this, HMM, Bad, bad, suckie bad... What a waste of time to watch it, let alone the time spent to get it. This is the first movie I have ever purchases that I will trash. Even ""Battel field earth"" was better then this. Way bad. And not the good bad the really bad bad. It sucks."
1,What a waste,"DO NOT WASTER YOUR MONEY! This is perhaps the worst movie I have seen, low budget (and it shows), poor acting, stupid plot, how someone could read this script and say lets spend millions on this is unknown to me. Clearly the greed to capitalize on the original film is evident from the moment it starts playing, and folks that is the only reason this film was made because someone was greedy, they could of had a nother hit with some creativity and effort but alas this is a big fat flop, run away..."
1,"Expected little, and thats what I got","After finding out that Starship Troopers 2 was a straight to DVD movie, I became already disappointed but, being a huge fan of Starship Troopers, I rented the sequel. My expectations were very low, and for good reason. Every, I mean EVERY core element that made the first movie so great is gone. The quirky military propaganda is ruined. And there is no large-scale war. Or for that matter, small scale war. Due to the low budget they had to change the story to a overly done, very cliche` rendering of ""Aliens taking over the brains of soldiers and turning them against themselves."" Some of the special effects footage is repeated often throughout the movie and some of the footage is from the first movie!. They obviously did this to keep the audience thinking ""Oooooh Ahhhhh"" when really most are thinking ""What a waste."" And a waste this movie is. Fans, you have been warned."
1,IT NEVER HAPPENED!!!,"I can fix this! This movie never happened. Now we need to make Starship Troopers 2. I will contribute a few bucks. If we all contribute, we can get an actual director to come along, preferably the one from the first movie, get us some big time sponsors, and make us one heck of a Starship Troopers 2! There, I have repaired the terrible tear in all our souls that this fake Starship Troopers 2 caused us all."
1,please don't buy this,"Well of course sequels are tough, but this is one of the worstmovies I've ever seen, period. Hello ... straight to video shouldtell you something. I liked starship troopers so much that Iendured this film. You shouldn't have to."
1,Aliens meet Grunts in Space.,"A disappointment! A dark, dirty facsimile of the original, missing the humor and the team bonding of that first. If you are looking for a SCI FI escape,this is not the film. If you are looking for the horror genre, such as Nightmare on Elm Street, or Friday the Thireenth, this might be a three star. Gore for the blood thirsty. Like Alien, the bugs have infiltrated.I watched Starship Troopers 2 only once; Starship Troopers half a dozen times.Good performances:Brenda Strong as Sgt. Dede Rake is a real D.I.J.P. Manoux as T/Sgt Ari Peck, his acting that makes you itch.Ed Quinn as Corporal Joe Griff, charismatic medicRichard Burgi - Captain Dax; probably did a good job, but reminded me too much of Richard Hatch from Survivors."
1,The Fact...,...that their helmets are Photoshopped onto their heads on the box art should be more than enough of a portent of what is to come.
1,Appalling!,"I'm a big fan of the first movie... The writers, production crew and even some of the actors should be sent to Abu Ghraib prison! The plot had potential but never realized it fully. I could spend hours listing the many faults of this movie but here are just a few: (1). The psychics are always having flashbacks that make them appear so melodramatic that you wonder why the Federation even let them live; (2). The respect for the chain of command was lacking in this futuristic society run by the military; (3). Brenda Strong, the female captain of the Rodger Young in ST #1, plays an insubordinate seargent in ST #2; and, (4). It mimicked the first film's propaganda alerts so poorly that you're disappointed within the first 5 minutes.Save your money... that's a couple of hours of my life that I won't be getting back."
3,Not so bad,I really Loved Captain Dax and the ponytail girl as she is called...LOL...but I also liked the Peck character. I loved the first one...true this is not as good as the first one and there could have been more screen time for the bugs but I really enjoyed it. I love Richard Burgi who did a wonderful job as Dax. I even pre-ordered it so I hope alot of you give it a chance. It was a fun ride.
2,Disappointing,"Bottom line...No cool new bugs, just tiny ones that live in humans. No tankers, plasma, hoppers, brain, or carrier bugs. Mainly warriors and the new dinky bugs that live in humans. CGI wasn't very good. They try to hide it buy keeping the movie dark."
2,This is not a very good movie,"The effects look great. The story is so borrowed form everywhere. The acting for the most part stinks. I will give them points for lots of violence and boobs, but all in all a pretty poor movie."
1,"Not like the original!!!!!!! soooooo horrible, I almost shut it off.","I will sum up very quickly, that this movie is not at all like the origional. What was once a nice little sci fi story with a fun plot, is now just a god awful ""horror film"" in StarShip Troopers 2.Yes, it's a god awful ""horror film"". One hour into the movie I was really thinking of shutting it off......... because it was so horrible. I waited to the end, just to see if it was some joke, or if they was something really diffrent in the end........ but it was'nt... that was the actual story line behind it.Too bad to, because I enjoyed the first one."
2,Blast it!,I just finish watching it and I am very disapointed! If we give the first movie a 5 then this is at most a 2. I would have thought that given how good the first movie was that they would stick with what worked. This movie just uses the bug conflict as a background to a 'B+' rated script.
2,Starship Troopers II--Don't Waste the Money,"This is supposedly a sequel to the original Starship Troopers, which was a waste of time and effort to begin with. This movie does nothing to improve the story line. Robert Heinlein must be spinning in his grave.Bugs have made a way to inhabit human hosts, get the humans to do their bidding, and replicate their kind to make more bug-zombies. A renegade human who is on charges for murdering his former commander, saves the day.Good special effects and photography. Poor acting, and even poorer story line.Save your money."
3,A Saturday afternoon B movie,"This movie had a little bit of The Thing, Star Trek TNG Conspiracy, and Alien in it. Nothing original about. What it lacked that the original had was a little fun and suspense. The actors did there part well, and the special FX were not shappy at all. For those looking for the originality of the first StarTroopers I would rate this a 2 star. If you just want to kick back and enjoy a no brainer movie you will love the film. Don't look for a plot line that continues on from the first one. Just take this movie on it's own merits. It would be nice if James Camaron could do a 3rd StarTroopers."
1,A Fiasco,"A BIG disappointment. This ultra-low budget, direct-to-video sequel to Paul Verhoeven's classic sci-fi action satire is inferior in just about every way possible. A lousy script (surprising, because it was penned by Ed Neumaier, the same guy who penned the original, as well as co-authored yet another razor-sharp Verhoeven classic, ""Robocop""), terrible effects and cinematography and sluggish direction sink this one from the get-go. Most of the proceedings (especially the action scenes) are filmed in near-total darkness (probably to mask the cheapjack special effects), making it a real headache to watch. Not even some gratuitous nudity from the luscious Kelly Carlson (""Nip/Tuck"") makes this worth the effort. Stick with the first one and don't waste your time here."
1,HORRIBLE!,"This movie has NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH PART 1! Its like a totally different movie, with the enemy!"
3,"not a bad movie, not a good one either","definitely low budget, though the director tried to disquise this in many ways. not the best material to work with, certainly cheesy and cliche at some points, but the actors ""did what they could with what they had"". If you liked the first one, atleast rent this one."
3,not quite from zero,"The name of this book is rather deceiving. I would not call it ""from zero"" or for absolute beginners. This book assumes that you know how to read music, know where to put your fingers on the recorder for different notes, and probly that you are learning under a music teacher. For the self-taught, true novice like me, this book is useless. I ordered ""Fun with the Recorder"" by MelBay publications and learned how to read the music, where to place my hands for the notes, and learned one note at a time-- building. Now, as a second book of learning, I can appreciate this book, but certainly not from the beginning."
5,Great for our Recorder Club,"We have formed a recorder club at our community center where members can join if they can read music and understand timing. Those who have joined played other instruments but wanted to learn to play the recorder. These lessons provided great practice in learning new notes gradually, and improving our fingering dexterity. We have enjoyed playing early music and being challenged with increasing complexity."
2,What Happened?,"In reviewing the music, I found that this is not the same Rip, Rig and Panic from 1982. I cannot find any recordings from then. Where is that music?"
3,Thesis about Sylvia Plath,"I liked how the book begins with the days before her suicide and then rolls into her life. It mirrors the title of ""The Death and Life of Sylvia Plath"". Her fame skyrocketed after her suicide, but there were so many events of her life that deserve attention.The writing style is stifled, no real emotion, and gives the impression of being the author's doctoral thesis (I do not know if this is the case at all). It follows a very formulaic style to the point where as a reader, I was able to predict what he was going to say next.It was a very good book nevertheless and I do recommend it."
3,COULD BE BETTER,For all of us who first tried the Kick off in Atari st almost 20 years ago we expect much more from a mid 00's console soccer game. The graphics are really good and that's why I give it three stars but I didn't like the fact that the game includes limited number of teams (32 only)and I believe that the interface should be friendlier. I did try the game only in my Xbox because all the reviews mention that this is its best version.
3,FIFA game,"Great graphics, and good game to entertain yourself with when you want to kill time. I liked playing this game because it has more challenges to beat. I would recommend it to friends."
4,Fifa 06,"When you play this soccer game, you will quickly realize why this is the best selling soccer franchise in the world."
3,Overwritten fantasy,This is an overwritten fantasy by the author. It does not have an authentic voice for the time it is set in or the characters it portrays. It was a great disappointment and so is Ms Dykewomon.
2,"Well-researched, but falls flat","This is an important story which needs to be heard, which means it also deserves to be written well. Unfortunately, Beyond the Pale is over written, and the main romance unsatisfying. In the last half of the book, the frequent point of view shifts are distracting-- the hodge-podge seams of the book show through. Although the author captures Yiddish inflections in the dialogue very well, the dialogue itself is often unnatural, reading like a summary of political arguments in a classroom, rather than revealing innuendos of character and mood. The character of Gutke the midwife is the most interesting aspect of the book, but too little a part of it to be a reason to recommend it. I became quickly impatient with its sentimentality and wooden politics."
5,This is not your father's Ellis Island story.,"Dykewomon's latest novel is intricate and well-researched. It was a treat for my mind and my heart. Prospective readers should know that Beyond the Pale is no ordinary cotton-candy escape novel; it provokes thought, it compels joy, sorrow, and everything in between. I love it ferociously!"
1,Worse than bad,"Although you may be tempted to pick this up as a gag gift for a ""Millionaire"" or Regis fan, don't! The cartoonish characters are annoying, but the whole ""beat up a millionaire"" concept isn't even funny. The only thing you'll want to beat up is yourself for buying this game.The only game I've seen that's worse than this is Survivor."
3,speedway,"My fault. Sometimes old time movies are not was what you thought they would be., but would reoder from this company"
5,William Haines first openly gay actor,"William Haines is now forgotten for the most movie fans. But he was once one of the biggest silent movie star like Rudolph Valentino, Ramon Novarro - and the first one where was openly gay in the film business. There is available a Biography about him by ""William J. Mann"".To this DVD / movie:Wow, the score is new recorded and not boring like other silent movies scores with organ pipe etc.The picture quality is for a movie of this age very good.Fazit: I love it (but my favorite is still ""West Point"" with William Haines)"
5,Read it in one night,"What a riot this book was. A lot of these stories I had heard before, but others I hadn't. Entertaining and amusing, for those who like this kind of book I would recommend this highly. The author makes a few good points. The hostility towards long hair in the 1960's was real, and he points out that long hair didn't become ""mainstream"" until the early 70's with the general population. There is also a chapter on the Woodstock festival, and Fein points out that the proximity to NY and the fact that the event got filmed made it seem as if that was the only festival that summer. In fact there were many others that have been forgotten along the way. Little tidbits such as that give this book credibility beyond the gossipy nature of this kind of book."
1,"Yeah, but ...",Mr. Fein does a great job of retelling many familiar Rock and Roll myths as well as a few outright lies. He really did his homework - it is just too bad his dog didn't eat it
2,NOT MEANT FOR A CHILD OVER 3!!,"I am so disappointed with this sleeping bag. I bought it for my daughter's 5th birthday and since the age was 3-7, figured it would be the perfect size. Though my daughter is a little tall for her age, she certainly isn't the height of a 7 year old!!! She still should have had plenty of room to sleep in this sleeping bag. However, it was too small for her! She couldn't use the pillow as her head went past it! THIS IS WAY TOO SMALL FOR ANYONE OVER 3 or 4 years old, especially if your child is tall for her age."
5,"Different, but good!","A very interesting tale of a couple on a trip to a very secluded area (beach in Austrailia), and their lack of respect for nature.This was a remake of the late 70s Long Weekend which almost goes line for line with this movie."
4,grave earns 4 shovels,I caught this movie on Showtime today and thoroughly enjoyed every minute. There were some truly unexpected twists and that's what true movie lovers desire..right? There were a couple of mistakes in this movie but not enough to hurt a great time on a Wednesday afternoon with nothing to do. The tension between the young couple connected well with the unfamiliar Australian coastline wild. This is a scary movie for a lot of reasons you don't normally see in a woodsy thriller. The ending was scary as heck and makes you think about camping in the wilderness without full knowledge of not only where you are but what's watching you and what can harm you. Very good film.
1,NATURES GRAVE,"I MUST SAY THAT WE WERE HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS MOVIE. I LOVE WATCHING JAMES CAVIEZEL, BUT HE MUST SURELY BE ASHAMED OF THIS ONE. THE WHOLE CONCEPT STINKS AND I COULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS ONE TO ANYONE."
2,What's The Point?,"Jim Caviezal is a great actor, but I don't get this movie. It's basically the story of a dysfunctional couple that goes camping and has a complete and total meltdown. There seems to be some kind of revenge of nature theme, but the whole thing doesn't connect; it's too ambiguous. The director needs to spell it out more clearly for idiots like me, because this one doesn't make a lick of sense.There was plenty of tension in the movie to keep you interested in what was going to happen but ultimatly it goes nowhere. I would recommendMadison,Frequency (New Line Platinum Series)orOutlander, but this movie fails."
2,;0),Got the message of the movie and you have to give them A- for originality but Nature is the killer don't even see how they got killed which iis the best part of a thriller not bad-ish but it could have been wayyyyyyyyybetter especially coming from an actor as James Caviezel come on and I rather there had been more than 2 people through 98% of the movie maybe then it could give it that scarey feel.
3,just okay,"i knew it was going to be small but i thought it would be okay. but practically i dont use it much, i wouldnt get it again. it is okay quality, nothing special but i good price i guess."
5,Ireland in your car!,If you love tin whistle music you will love Joannie Madden. The music fills my car and my house of happy melodies that bring a smile to your face.
5,Joanie Madden creates another classic,"Joanie's follow up to Songs of the Irish Whistle is a more-than-worthy successor to the best-selling tinwhistle album of all time (if you don't count The Titanic, which you certainly shouldn't). In addition to her fine interpretation of traditional Irish tunes, she records pieces from the movie ""Pinehurst,"" and, to my delight, a piece from the neglected soundtrack album, ""The Way West."" This CD will deservedly rival the first volume in sales and devotees."
5,Gardena 30609-10 Pruning shears,"I had purchased a pair of these shears several years ago to use in my job with a land surveyor. I found them to retain sharpness reasonably well and liked the feature that allowed for thicker cutting . I especially liked the position of the lock button on top as opposed to on the side which caused me to often lock shears when I did not intend to. I have used several kinds and brands , but for me personally, I like these."
5,best movie,thimovie the best for kids for the hole family love this movie it for all age too i tell everone to get
3,Talent Show Song,2/3 of triplets watched it all the way through. Why does Lugosi school (the organ tune) in the talent show sounds so familar. What is that song?
4,Cute and entertaining for kids,"I thought this was a very cute movie. Perfect for young kids, especially dog lovers. My daughter is 8 and loved it. It obviously wasn't produced with the biggest budget or best script, but I believe she'll enjoy watching it over and over simply because it is entertaining and humerous. There were a couple of snotty kids but they get put in their place by the end of the movie. A couple of ""you guys suck"" is really the only objectionable words. The explanation as to why the dog ate gelatin instead of drinking blood made perfect sense! More simple, funny, sweet stories like this should be produced for kids, in my opinion. We also enjoyed the gag reel during the end credits. :) I would recommend this movie for 5-12 year olds."
5,LifeSavers,"Everyone at work loves LifeSavers, whether you crunch or suck on them. All except the GREEN and WHITES. Come on LifeSavers, bring out a grape\blackberry only bag!"
2,packaging ugh!,OK....so I do love lifesavers. But I don't want to have to fight to open the stupid packaging of every single one of them. What's up with that? I have arthritis and this is a real chore trying to eat these things.
4,Excellent for those learning Japanese.,"Eric Carle and Kazuo Iwamura, Where Are You Going? To See My Friend! (Orchard, 2001)Once again, Eric Carle shows why he's one of the longest-standing, best-known and loved names in kids' books-- a bilingual (English/Japanese) book obviously aimed at the preschool set, but is also wonderful for adults trying to learn Japanese. Carle and Japanese kids' book artist Iwamura take pains to make sure the reader gets the picture that this is, in fact, a bilingual edition (the English moving left to right from the front of the book, the Japanese right to left from the back of the book, the two meeting in the middle) with graphic clues next to the words to let you know who's speaking (and how to look it up on the other side). The Japanese text also comes with pronounciations.Great stuff, as always. If you're learning Japanese, no matter how old you are, you'll want it. ****"
4,Great book for recipes and history,"I have this book and I think the recipes in it are wonderful, but also the history behind the recipes is very interesting. As for the other person's review on this, this is meant for a review of the book, not the person or company that's selling it."
1,This person is not truthful,The item this person listed was totally untrue. The stated 2 volumes in 1 edition was totally false. This was Volume 2 only. When I wrote to this person - 4 different times - he never responded. I would never purchase anything from this person again. Buyer Beware of anything this person lists.
1,Bait and Switch,"Ordered the Bionaire 911D but received another brand from the secondary supplier. Under ""Product Description"" Depending on availability, you may receive a replacement model CB11. I did not see this when ordering thru Amazon and guess what? I did receive the CB11 which I did not want. Good thing is I called the Company and got a RA number and have sent them back for the correct Bionaire but this meant an unplanned trip to the local post office and now a new pin pal to recoup the shipping cost. Bait and Switch ?!!!"
3,"Not OEM, a decent replacement","the company shown BIOAIRE, these are not bioaire they are made by another manufacture and seem good but are mislabeled"
3,Call Bionaire Directly,"If you have a Bionaire console humidifier, you need these filters, which should be replaced roughly every two months.But as much as I enjoy using Amazon (been a Prime member for years), this is not the product to purchase from Amazon. Call Bionaire directly. Instead of complaining about getting a non-Bionaire replacement, you'll get the genuine product, often for less. As I write this, they are having a 40% off sale on filters -- filters <$8, wicks <$10 per pair -- and free shipping on orders over $25."
5,bionaire,this is really great. we had lots of dust but this product has reduced theduwt by 80% and has really added to the comfort of our home.
1,"After two weeks, the massager stopped working","After two weeks, the massager stopped working. I even replaced the batteries but it would no longer turn on. I had to return the product for a refund.Also, the battery comparment easily falls out of its slot in the cushion whenever the cushion is moved and often sticks into your back.The memory foam flattens out and doesn't really offer the support I needed or expected, far less support than a normal pillow."
1,I suggest looking elsewhere,"The foam was not study enough to support my 180lbs; after sitting with it for just a few moments, the massage nodes began poking into my back, the battery pack the same. The foam needs to be firmer."
3,"Good lumbar pillow, still need a massage though.","Bought this several years ago as a gift for my husband. His back would hurt after hours in his office chair. He stopped even trying to use the massager part and just used it as a pillow after a few months. The massage is a high vibration that made his back itch after a few minutes, although he enjoyed it until the itching kicked in. Still uses the pillow to improve the back support in his chair."
3,Warm Bodies,"Received this paperback book in good time. The original .35 cover price, replaced by the $8.35 cost, really shows how inflation works! Having said that, I am happy to have found a copy of this fifty year old book. Thanks. JCT"
4,good disc,"i have always respected Salt&Pepa.they are pioneers in the rap game to me.this disc is good i liked let's talk about sex,expression.they have there own flow&style."
5,quality gadgets-----not throw -a-ways,"buy this!i sat on the fence for about 3 months putting this in and out of my shopping cart, when i first saw it it was about a hundred dollars,that i thought was high for gadgets having only purchased such items from super markets and yes dollar stores......looking at the decription i assumed there would be ""filler items"" with no real value of its own, except to pump up the count,such as the nylon spoons ect.WAS I WRONG! every item in this set i would buy on its own without thinking twice for $10 to $20 each!every item in this set is stand alone quality, this is where buying online gets clouded without ""hands on"" factor, if u were in store u would not hesitate to buy.its been going on sale from time to time and from amazon it's on the 4 for 3 promo.if you intend to buy 3 or 4 of the items that are in the set,get the whole set and make your kitchen happy!"
3,"Top notch tools, horrible storage","The tools are excellent, no complaints, they get 5 stars. The storage base is another story. These tools all have large rubber covered handles. Rubber does not move against rubber. It takes 2 hands to take a tool out and put a tool back in the storage base. Real pain. Then the base does not have rubber on it's bottom so it slides around as I'm trying to stuff in a tool. Very inconvenient. Had to take several tools out so it can be used properly and that has defeated my desired purpose of having all the tools on counter and handy, easy in and out of their base. I would buy the tools again but would never ever recommend this set with that base. 5 stars for the tools, 0 stars for the base = 3 stars"
4,Love it,"I love these kitchen tools. The handles are larger than any others I have found so they are easy to hold and use. All of the tools are quality items much better than I thought they would be. Really the only thing bad I can say is the container really should be a little bigger, you have to arrange things just right to be able to fit them all in."
4,great stuff,"Haven't used everything yet. But the square turner, I think, is melting when I make eggs. And yeah, bucket is too small. Overall, everything is pretty good."
1,So disappointed.... DON'T BUY IT! You'll regret it!,"I got disappointed after the first use.I was making pancakes and spatula literally MELTED. I still can't take the leftovers off my brand new frying pan...And when I was cooking meat next time I used another potted spatula.. Guess what happened?????YES! It melted too! Not completely of course, but the part that was touching the pan.Please don't buy this set if you don't wanna waste your almost 100$ for nothing."
3,"The metal tools are nice. But at $99, why plastic?!",I decided to return this after realizing that the spoons/turner are a nylon plastic. I would have expected metal. All of the other tools are great (with the exception of the ice cream scoop not having a wiper). Ohwell...
3,Too much,"Too much ""stuff"" here. I have most of it and often mine is batter grade. For instance I use MicroPlane graters.Kitchen knife collections seem to be universally panned, and I think this collection might be too. Maybe OK for newbies or newlyweds but not for the rest of us.Do the silicone tools have stainless handles? Mine are but they are not Oxo. It is amazing to see silicone tools with wood or plastic handles that will burn or melt on the side of hot pans! Wood or plastic is just plain dumb. Makes a lifetime product into a throw away. That's more expensive in the long run and unsightly in the short run.Do not misunderstand me. Oxo produces some of the very best kitchen tools made IMO, bar none. It's just that this set is too much."
1,Garbage tool set,This was over priced and very poor quality. The tools are flimsy and don't fit very nice in the holder. If you like quality keep looking.
3,"One year later, not bad for the price","I purchased this for use in my apartment and the utensils are holding up decently for plastic cookware. The smaller spatula is starting to break a little, but everything else still looks fairly new. I would recommend to anybody looking for an affordable cookware set for a new apartment!"
3,the potato peeler is not for a left-hander,"I like this set, but I don't like that the potato peeler has been designed for a right-hander. I still use it as the blades are sharp enough for now, but clearly it is more efficient when held in the right hand. Either publish that information in the product description, or change your design. As a left-hander I feel REALLY unhappy about this and now I am going to have to get another potato peeler, which I didn't anticipate having to do after buying a complete kitchen tool set! It is a bit of a tight squeeze to fit all of the items into the container, and with sharp blades around, the last thing you want to do is try to squeeze in (or extract) a tightly placed utensil. I washed everything in the dishwasher, including the container, and there were no problems at all."
3,Great tools but only worth half the container minus the container,I bought these a few months back and they worked great but only half of them lasted. The metal container also is too small. On a upside they have everything you need and look really nice in any kitchen. I would recommend you purchase a container and buy individual kitchen tools that you need. Allot of places have the oxo products for a few dollars so you can make your own set....Just a thought
3,Spoons Retain Water In Handle,"There is a serious design flaw in the large spoons, and that's a crying shame since there are a lot of other utensils in this set that are pretty nice. The spoons are made of two parts, a top half and a bottom half, and when I wash them in the dishwasher a lot water accumulates in the handle. I didn't notice it at first, but then it starts to leak slowly out when the spoon is moved in a certain motion. This may be a sanitary issue depending how dirty the trapped water can be and how long it has been sitting in the handle. There really is no excuse for this design flaw given how long Oxo has been in business and how much they charge for this product. I'm going to have to wash those spoons by hand and hope a lot of water doesn't get in them when doing so."
1,the container is the pits,"i bought the utensil holder several years ago and it is long gone. i may have kept it for a year. it began to pit, rust, and corrode almost immediately. i loved the design because it is so contemporary but do not waste your money on this. i also think $99 is too much of a bargain for all these items. one is always best off buying fine utensils that are not in a ""set"" which often translates as poor quality lumped together for a presentation . i learned a long time ago that in cooking utensils and equipment, you pay for what you get and the high quality items are to be researched and purchased separately. i use equipment that is durable, efficient, and highly recommended by cooking professionals. this utensil holder (and from what i have read, the utensils [plastic spoons melted from the heat if left in the pan!!!]) does not fall into the high quality category."
5,Great Dish!!,"These dishes are wonderful. They go straight from the oven to the table. They are beautiful, durable, and don't seem to ware at all."
1,If you want your child to work at a Burger joint!!!,"My babysitter bought this DVD at Walgreens. After watching Sports Bloopers Volume1 my hopes were not high, because it was made by the same company. We previewed it to see if a baby my baby sitter was watching would enjoy, as a baby. When we got to Mozart there was pictures of a pile of dolls that was spinning around, and toy cars being pushed across the screen. I'm NOT making this up. Do not buy this. It is a waste of time and your money."
1,What??,"This has to be one of the least inventive movies ever made. I mean, who could even think that it was possible for a man-eating computer to.... oh wait, wrong movie.I give it 5 stars."
3,Only assembly comments for now,"Sat down to do the midnight before Christmas assembly last night so I wanted to post just FYI. The assembly really is easy and quick (less than 20 minutes....I'm a 66 year old very techy and handy grandmother). The only difficulty I had was connecting the electrical connections. They are thin and hard to connect because the plastic housing in both cases is sharp edged and doesn't slide in easily. We have several other battery powered ride-ons for our older grandson and the quality of the connectors in all is much higher. The charger has no charge light to either indicate the level of charge or that its charging at all, unless it comes on when charging is complete, so with the poor fit I guess I'll have to wait until the 18 hours is up to see if it's charged.If you find yourself in a last minute assembly situation, it won't take long at all."
5,My son has been riding this toy alone since he was 7 months old.,"quick review:He is not quite 2 years old. We ""inherited"" this toy (ours is so old it's the LIL' Kawasaki model) from his cousin so it's very durable since it's in great shape.AS FAR IT'S EDUCATIONAL VALUE, I think it has taught him great motor skills, turning corners in our home and outside on the front porch and it's teaching him balance and flexibility as he maneuvers in and around things.We have my son on cell phone video just after he took his first step, rolling on it at full speed while relatives took photos on their phones, and it is hilarious."
4,Nice laugh factor,"My son received this for his first birthday. At first he wasn't completely into it but after a few days he has ""really taken off"". My only concern is that it is rather small. My son is in the 60 to 75th percentile of kids his same age and size and I bet within 3 months he won't fit comfortably on it. Oh, and it doesn't have a reverse button. But my husband and I enjoy pulling our son back from some blockade that he has just run into; mostly walls. This is an entertaining gift for all."
3,Reverse would be nice,"I purchased this quad for my then 18 month old son for Christmas. The description says it's great for toddlers. To me that is ages 1-3. My son got on and can go straight and turn but when he ends up at the fence he can't turn it around...there is no reverse. He loses interest because he wants to keep going. If you're over cautious or maybe for a younger child this product would be great. It is very sturdy, easy to put together and the speed is just right. The battery holds a nice long charge too.Overall I think it is a good product but w/ the option of reverse it would be fantastic. I will look to purchase again another car for my sons 2nd birthday that comes equipped with reverse."
4,Fun for little ones,"Purchasded two for our ome year old twin grandsons. They are still learning to control them, but they are enjoying the ride. Easy to assemble and seem durable. They were out of stock everywhere except Amazon. Ordered and received in less than one wee,"
5,19M Grandson LOVES this!,"I got this for my 19M Grandson's first visit. He immediately got on and pushed the button to go,go,go! He always smiled and had the most wonderful time. I highly recommend this toy to anyone who is considering a riding car for the younger children."
5,The monster is defeated again.,Beowulf (Signet Classics)My youngest son has been wildly enamoured of Beowulf for the past 40 years. I finally found a translation that made sense. It was one of his Christmas presents.
2,Not very clear,"The label is more like frosted, not clear... probably ok for use on white, but on my candle jars where the candles are bright colors, it looks terrible (see photos)."
3,A Forgotten Canadian Band,"Somewhat groovy, somewhat dated, this album nonetheless can get the toes tapping. The best song on the album is the cover Everyone's A Winner Baby.Lots of old party memories with this disk..."
1,I bought this disc for one reason and one reason alone.,"By the time I found out about this CD I was a huge fan of Omar, so I made it my mission to find it. Finally, I did find it and while the other tracks were less than memorable to me, Omar's rendition of ""Natural Mystic"" made it all worthwhile. Fellow Omar fans will surely love it, too, but don't just take my word for it. Listen to the sample track and decide for yourself!"
2,Not the usual stuff from 3rd Force,"I love all of 3rd Force's other albums but not this one. If you've heard the other ones don't expect this one to have the usual sound because it does not. I tried but just could not get into this one and it's now sitting on the shelf collecting dust. I've bought all of their albums on faith after the first one but next time I'll listen to samples. There's nothing wrong with a band wanting to do something different, and in fact you might like this stuff. Just be forewarned!!! Therefore the two stars is because I just can't get into it not because they are not good musicians."
3,Adolescent,"I loved this show because i loved SVH books and as an ode to that love i bought this dvd collection. However, the acting was soooo mediocre that i only now recognise it as i have grown up so much. If you are a young love to SVH, it is a great dvd to purchase. If not, i would not recommend."
2,"Eh, not as good as I remember","I remember catching an episode of this show here & there was I was young, probably 12. I remember it being kinda fun. So I impulsively bought this dvd (somewhere else for around $20) & I just couldn't get into it. I watched about 3 1/2 episodes, but Jessica (one of the main stars) just grated on my nerves. This girl was such a tease. Plus everytime she did something wrong she got off pretty lightly. If anything she would get back at somebody else. She was also very easily forgiven by her sister, whom she used just like everyone else. Some shows like Saved by the Bell I can watch now & still enjoy, but not this show. I'm happy for the huge fans of this show that it's out there for them. However, if you aren't a hard core fan, like me, make it a rental, not a purchase. Oh, the show also seems like a showcase for these girls bodies. So I wouldn't be surprised if some girls brothers decided to watch this show with them."
4,Brings back memories,"I remember reading the books when I was younger. Then years later they came out with this show. Even though I was in my teens, I was pretty excited...not gonna lie! lol Granted the books are always better but the TV show is good, corny, but good. No complaints except it took awhile to get the dvd box out of the case for some reason. But the actual dvds are in great shape!"
5,"Corny and bad acting, but who cares!","I loved watching this show on Saturday mornings, i couldn't wait to get up and watch it. Alot of you may have noticed that there is no SVH season 2 anywhere in site, and that's because of lack luster sales, which isn't to hard to believe, BV is charging $45 dollars and up for a 3 disc set of 20 minute shows with no extras! that's a bit ridiculous, you would think that a bell would go off for them but i guess it hasn't, anyway SVH fans it's time to band together the rest of the SVH series is rumored to be in jeporady of not getting released so write to Buena Vista and tell them you want it: Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Inc./Dept. CS,/Burbank, CA 91521: you can also check out their website about contacting them through email:http://video.movies.go.com/"
2,Very different,"This DVD is very different from the books. I was dissapointed. Where is nice and kind Elizabeth who always protected Jessica? In this movie Elizabeth is humiliating her sister, trying to teach her a lesson. And Jessica is just mean. The movie doesn show what a wonderful parents sisters have. And a good brother. I found this movie mean and boring. Very sad, because i am a big fan of books. They are interesting and kind. Each book teaches you a good lesson. You want to meet this twins-girls. You want to be their friend. And the movie is going the opposite direction. No wonder movie wasnt popular. And the first season was the last one.One good thing- sisters are pretty in the movie too. Just admire their beauty!"
3,Not new,"There is no WAY the DVDs I received were new, even though I bought them new. Whatever. It's not like these are the Criterion collection, but Amazon really should send what they advertise."
2,HON 20000 Mobile Pedestal,File drawer has rollers rather then slides with bearing. Lack of space between drawers results in rubbing and rapid loss of surface finish/paint. Overall I was not pleased with the quality of construction. Found out this model is no longer made and would recommend mobile pedestal from HON's Flagship line as it has ball bearing slides. Found a local supplier who quoted a lower price for the Flagship Pedestal and would not require paying for shipping.
1,Oscillated nicely for one summer,It Oscillated nicely for awhile. Now it just gets stuck on whatever setting it's put on. Bummer. I need to buy one of those small round ones and I think it will do a better job just to have to move it around the yard. I won't be buying this brand again.
4,Oscillating sprinkler,This oscillating sprinker covers a large area. It can be adjusted so the sprinkler will rotate for those hard to water areas. I am very pleased with this product.
2,You get what you pay for,"The sprinkler worked great for a month, then the hose connection broke clean off after moving it normally. It was made of cheap thin plastic where it should have had more support. Guess I'll spend the money and get something that will last."
1,"Cheap, light, and never oscillated a bit for me","Getting ready to return this one, as it has yet to move an iota. The instructions are nonexistant, the iconography confusing, and everything but the highly-touted brass nozzles is made of paper-thin plastic. Is it so hard to make a sprinkler that waves back and forth... without fail? That used to be the norm, not the exception."
1,Broken after one week usage,"At the beginning, we like it very much for its design. However, it got broken after being used for one week. The plastic parts are very delicate."
1,Total cheap garbage,I bought this same one from WalMart and lasted about a month and would get stuck half way through the oscillation every time. It would have been a good sprinkler if it had continued to work. This falls into the seemingly growing list of worst garbage I've ever bought.
5,Heck yes,"This is a great sprinkler for cheap. I haven't used it very much, so I can't comment on the longevity or durability of it, but on the occasions I have used it, it performed great."
1,Very difficult to adjust the coverage area,"It is very difficult to adjust the coverage area to exactly what you want. The image on the unit only only gives you an idea, it is not possible to adjust the oscillating angle on one side without changing the other side, and the maximum oscillating angle available when you have it on full coverage is not available if you only want partial coverage. I have spent close to half an hour each time trying to adjust it, and result is only partially satisfactory."
1,Didn't last one season,"These are very poorly constructed. Maybe it's the hot TX sun, but all five I purchased broke within just a few uses. The plastic is cheap and split apart or broken. Not abused as I set them up and left them. Used no more than 10 times each. May be good in a cooler climate, but definitely not a product for use in the hot sun."
3,Great Spray Coverage,"The spray coverage is absolutely fantastic. From end to end, I'm estimating it covers 35-40ft on each swipe (maybe even more). Settings are good and you can pick from various coverages.My biggest gripe is that it's a little flimsy. The hose connector has broken off twice and I bought the sprinkler again just becuase of the coverage it gets. You need to be extra careful with it and not toss it around after each use because it will break very easily."
2,cheap,"Good Qualities: 1. Covers a lot of area. Bad Qualities: 1. Gets stuck on one side often 2. Nozzle gets clogged. 3. Found it difficult to put hose in place. 4. The lower the pressure, the less likely the sprinkler will move, back and forth. Personal Difficulties: I had carried by the sprinkler and did not grab the hose to move it and the plastic nozzle part snapped so easily. Very Cheap in my opinion. Overall did not like this product had more bad and difficult problems then good. Would not buy again."
1,went through two. got to treat it delicate,"The point where the hose connects to the device snapped twice. Sure it is the cheapest one, but why have brass nozzles like it is going to last? One of which ended up clogging. Before the hose junction snapped, it started spraying where the outlet bar connects. Pass on it."
4,Addie and the Laird,"The story starts out as 3 sisters decide to go to a town in the wildness, the only problem is that the town rule is no unmarried women are allowed. Addie and her two sisters are unwed but that doesn't stop them. They create husbands and plan their deaths of the husbands to end up widows. Funny scene in the book as the sisters make up the death of their make beleive husbands. Addie is the oldest sister and some what of a shrew having to raise her sisters when their parents were killed by a flood. As they arrive in McTavish Plain, Addie receives word that her husband in dead and now is a widow. Ian McTavish gives Addie a month to marry or leave town. Little does Ian know that he is falling for Addie. Overall a great book. I like Ian's pets they added humor to the story."
4,2 Versions of the book ?,"Agree with some of the derogatory comments.... stereotypical character development and implausible scenarios (am not too keen on this new stealth ""functionality""). In addition I found many plot points predictable. But, for a quick popcorn read it moves along quickly and is a fun ride. I rated a 4-star, but in reality a 3.5.And.... the editors note plus various reviews mention a war with Taiwan.... my 2012 Kindle version is a potential war with VietNam. My version mentions a previous war with Taiwan, but does not go into detail about that war's outcome."
4,This one Convinced me,"Having nevr read a Robert Gandt novel until this one, I was more than pleasantly surprised. I ead a lot of books, just to fill in the time. Not this one or any of his subsequent novels. This one is another of a series of engrossing novel from Robert Gandt and althought not up to early Clancy, not far from it."
5,Function and beauty,"This is by FAR my favorite baking dish! It's just the right size for so many side dishes-and it's the most attractive baking dish I've ever seen-Looks great on the table and takes higher temps than most baking dishes with ""looks"" -reasonable price -great size - a true must have!"
3,Not bad,"We bought these for a 11 hour car trip this holiday. My 3 year old daughter wasn't too into the activities. She likes the lacing game with the cat and butterfly, but she really doesn't play with anything else. For $[...], I feel it is a little over priced. The materials aren't that sturdy - carboard and foam. I think if I had payed less for it, I would feel better about it. But I think if your child was more mechanically minded, this would be a great buy. My daughter just wasn't that into it."
4,Very creative and fun,My 3 1/2 year old daughter has found many ways to play with this And she is now close to 5 and will still play with it sometimes. The only negative is the case. The front is that flimsy plastic material that fell off.
5,great fine motor activities,"For those of you out there looking for a ""fine motor"" and hand strengthening toy, this one is great. Very durable, and will keep little ones busy."
3,Why all the great reviews?,"Having never seen this set in person, I bought this product for my daughter based on the picture and the rave reviews it had received. There is nothing in this package that you can use while traveling except the lacing cards. Some of the pieces are so small it's almost a guarantee that half of them would never make it out of the car. I suppose the box itself makes it easier to bring it with you while traveling but it is a very cheap box and will probably fall apart by the end of our first trip. The other problem we have is with the pieces that ""lock together"". They are made of the same thin foam as the puzzles and it is impossible to make a ""structure"" because they are so flimsy. This activity set is more appropriate for putting the pieces on the kitchen table and letting your child play with it there. Overall, if I had found this for [price] I probably would be okay with it, but it is not worth [price]."
5,Great learning toy set,I bought this for my son when he turned three. He loved it and still plays with it a year later. It was also a good travel toy to take on vacation -- I sent a couple of these to my son's cousins as well.
4,Great travel toy for kids,"The Lauri Primer Pack is a great travel toy for kids. The items come in an easy to carry tote, and there is an amazing range of activities that can be done with this toy.With the soft foam shapes, you can play games in identifying the colors, shapes, lacing the shapes on the string, etc.The alphabet is useful for teaching letters and sounds.The lace up animals are good for practicing animal sounds, and hand/eye coordination.There are also pieces that can be joined to make interesting formations.This toy stimulates young minds with education and imagination. My wife pulled it out for our flight home from a vacation and our son was instantly engaged with it."
2,Too many pieces,"I bought this toy for my 2 year old based on the recommendation that it was a fun travel toy. We took it on a long car trip and 1 year later we are still finding pieces trapped between the seats. The lacing aspect of this toy was the only thing that really kept my 2 year old busy. I found the pieces to be very flimsy and hard to manipulate for my son. Also, the box fell apart almost immediately, making it impossible to contain the pieces we had left after the car trip. Maybe a great toy for an older child..."
3,"Not Detailed Enough, Yet Also Too Detailed","When I got this book via a swapping site, it had a small handwritten note inside. The previous owner had noted that this was a book that was easy to pick up and just as easy to put down. It was the kind of book to be kept in the kitchen to be read while waiting for a pot to boil! These comments capture my feelings towards the book rather well. The authors take the reader on a tour of the seventeen London boroughs that are outside the ""City"". The tours, one borough per chapter, are related partially as a first person narrative of their travels and partly as very brief bits of history. Brief in that the longest items might be a couple of paragraphs while most are one or two sentences. As a result the reader comes across a constant stream of facts and after a small amount of time feels as if he is drowning in minutia. Cautiously recommended as a curiosity, but not recommended for any serious study or long term reading pleasure."
4,Different,"I like this album because it is different from any other cds I have. It's not another Bob Marley, it is its own type of Reggae. It is really a mixture of Reggae and Folk. This is obvious because of Abdel Wright's integration of acoustic guitar and harmonica. Another important part of his music seems to be that each song seems to stand for an issue or something of more importance than one of his girlfriends. He has been praised by rock stars like Bono. If you took the initiative to remember his name, look him up on amazon and read my review than it is probably worth the risk to purchase the album."
3,Bono just don't know know,"Sure this album is easier to ingest than the vast majority of jamaican exports, and cross-genre experiments are always fresh and interesting; yet this artist's message and delivery are in no way comparable to Bob Marley. Bob Marley was a timeless performer sharing the roots reggae movement with the world. Mr. Wright makes pop music that is radio friendly internationally. The importance of the artist means so much more than record sales or distribution ranges. Don't get me wrong, the album is pleasant; but time will tell its importance."
3,I read Zane Grey as a teen,This book was as I remembered Zane Grey's books - I liked it and would read more in the future
3,COB reduced,"the 1030l replaced the 1040 model.the obvious differences are a drop from 14 amps to 13 amps, if this was it then no problem..... unfortunately it's not!!!!the 1030l is a much lesser product that they have obviously reduced the cost of build (even though retailed at the same price).The first thing is they dont include the ripguard on the 1030l - FFS it's a 10c piece of metal, why would they not include this.The second thing is that the 1030l doesn't include the spin lock button - basically this prevents the blade from spinning when you change the blade (among other things).Anyway, like i said it's still priced about right but dissapointing they removed basic things like this.Dean"
1,hard to figure out,"iam a girl and so not very tool savy,i could'nt get this to work!it may be fine for some but with me i needed a more user friendly tool."
4,"Great saw, but beware of no spindle lock","Update: Aug 20112 years later....there is something that went wrong. I use this to cut plywood and it just keeps on riding up to the guide. Maybe the blade is misaligned or it is the blade spindle, but was not expecting that. I will probably try and fix the defect but i am wondering what caused it. Maybe now, i will get something nicer.2009:Great saw. Change the blade to a 60 Teeth TCG and it is perfect for ripping those long sheets of plywood. The only thing i will change is probably get the 1040L which includes the spindle lock. Changing the blade is a pain without it."
1,A collection of poorly produced videos,"This is a box set of three of the worst produced videos on the world cup, maybe the box is supposed to make them better than their individual counterparts? Save your money and Buy FIFA Fever or History of Soccer. Far better products, I have them all, these ones would not be a good deal even at $5 and I can not think why these other two reviews praise this box set."
3,"Good price, terrible editing","It's a good product for the price. You will be able to see all some of the best goals and plays. However, the terrible editing will make your experience a lot less enjoyable than it could have been."
1,Terrible Design and Awful Customer Service!,"These are the cutest cups on the market...the only problem is that the first time you wash them in the dishwasher (on the top rack as recommended), the outer plastic warps so badly that the cups no longer stand up on a surface, so you can't store them in your cabinets or set them on a table!! They also crack and begin to leak moisture.Then, when you contact customer service, even if you return them within the warranty period, Evenflo will only replace them with the same totally awful cups (unless of course you want to spend more money on one of their pricier products, say, a carseat). My recommendation is to forget the Evenflo gimmicky cups and go for the good old stand-by: Gerber sippy cups, they work and last forever."
2,Not as good as I hoped!,"My daughter is easily entertained by spilling things. I got these in hopes of out smarting her. Not so much. She turns them over, liquid comes out. As if that didnt irk me enough, the dang straw doesnt attach to the lid very securely. If she drops a cup or I dont fit it in *just right* she will suck in air because the liquid isnt obtainable."
5,front bars are GREAT however...,"Received bars and they look great. easy to install and i'm very NON mechanical. However, ad clearly says ""front AND rear bars"". come to find out after not receiving rear bars that rear bars don't even exist for metrics! very very misleading and deceptive!"
2,"poor value, get this music & more on other CD's","There is much good music here but some of this 3 cd box set CD is duplicated on the more recent released single CD's ""West Coast Jazz"", ""The Steamer"" & ""Award Winner"". Those CD's, better mixes with more bits, contain less duplication of outtakes and more other songs, particularly more ballads (see my reviews).For the same price, the prudent Getz collector will get the three Cool classics listed above, instead.This music is mostly faster bebop."
5,Sahdra Bullock at her best!!!!,Sandra Bullock does a great job as a Beauty Pagent contestant in both of these movies.
2,Careful! Description not accurate....,"Great movies, but unfortunately only the first one in this set is widescreen. The second one is fullscreen ONLY. I was unpleasantly surprised, now you won't be."
5,excellent,very pleased with shipment once arrived. well packaged and speedy delivery. will buy again from seller.
5,"Great movies, looks great on blu-ray","These movies are both very guilty pleasures of mine and always have been ever since they came out. I have to admit that I wasn't really expecting it to have the greatest picture quality, but since I got a great deal I thought I'd give it a go. I was wrong, the movie looked a lot better on blu-ray than I expected. Sure it's not the best looking one out there, but it's definitely worth getting."
2,Misleading Aspect Ratio,"DVD description states ""Widescreen""; however, that is for only the 1st movie. The 2nd movie is in horrible full screen/pan & scan. Would have been nice if this had been stated in the Product Details, for I would not have bought the collection."
4,2 for 1 is wirth the money,I liked the first movie a lot and wanted to see the second one. We didn't have a copy ay home so this was an easy choice. Everyone in the family likes both and it will see a lot of play.
2,For Light Colored Shirts,"This is for light colored shirts, otherwise the product is good, Quality is great. I ordered this item and had it verified after calling customer service. The product ships from Avery and the item number for the item is for the 12 sheet, light colored shirts. When trying to find one for dark shirts, every transfer package, including Joanne fabrics came up as light t-shirt transfers.Avery 3279 Inkjet Dark T-Shirt Transfers[[ASIN:B000JCUCKC Avery Dennison Personal Creations Dark T-Shirt Transfers, 5 Iron-on Inkjet 8.5"" x 11"" Matte Transfers."
1,Ruined My Iron.... Thanks a lot Avery!,"Avery did a very poor job on their instructions. They don't tell you which side of the paper to print on. Well, I ended up printing on the wrong side and when I placed my iron down on the transfer paper, I started to smell burning. It was the glue side! So that iron is completely ruined (has burnt glue crusted on it.)Advice: print on the white ridged side. NOT the smooth blue side! (I am no transfer pro so it was not clear to me. It really wasn't.) So unless you're a pro and have been doing transfers for a while, this might not be the best company to use."
1,"IF you don't mind spending $50 on something you'll have to replace every few months, then this is the mp3 player for you.","I purchased one of these a few months ago. I loved the wireless aspect- no cords to catch on anything. Sound was acceptable, though certainly less than others I've had.But, it crapped out on me. Stopped turning on and won't open with usb cable. The earpiece with the controls on it is cracking open at the seam. So, not very durable. I'm not a fan of shoddy goods."
4,Hisonic 2GB Headphones,"In short, pretty sweet.I usually wear these for jogging and they rock! I've had them for a few weeks now using them almost every day.Pros: Great battery life on a single AAA, buttons very easy to use while wearing, good quality, comfortable for pretty long time, light weightCons: Has cut off on me a few times while listening, but very infrequent and it cuts right back on. Syncing takes a long time, prob 30 mins to fill the whole thing from nothing. If your not changing much though or don't need to sync often, sync time isn't a big deal though."
5,Great Product So Far,"I bought this because I hate taking my iPod to the gym, putting it my pocket and then have a wire running up to my earphones. This product has the MP3 built into the headphones. Loading is very easy, and it runs off an AAA battery. It has a lot of nice features too.The only thing I am concerned about, is will it hold up. I have been only using it for 1 week. Frisby 2gb Wireless Sport Mp3 Player Headset"
1,Cheap,"Worked Great for the first week. Now it will not turn on, it just quit working. It was not dropped, hit, kicked or abused in any way it just broke after 1 week."
3,Worked well for roughly 8 months,"They worked well, and exactly how I needed them to, for roughly 8 months. After that the sweat from working out just completely zapped them... kinda bummed they are labeled as sport mp3 players and can't take sweat from working out."
2,Quit working after a few months,"I really liked it at first, but after a few months it started turning itself off.It still works as a two gig disc, but the player is not functional."
4,french soul is good,"this album is a good sum up of what Axelle does the best, starting disc one with sensualite is certainly the best introduction of her talent!"
3,Technodog,"These red hots are decent, but not very hot actually. I found them to be a bit on the salty side although not too bad. They have a better texture than many of the individual packaged products and for the cost, not a bad choice if you prefer a milder type of red hot.The service was very prompt and they also sent a free beef jerky sampler. ""Their beef jerky is unsurpassed in quality and I would have to highly recommend trying it as I know you won't be disappointed!"""
1,So bad!,"Ordered these for a ice fishing trip, where we sit in a shack drink beer and eat strong flavored food. These were so so bad not one of my 5 friends or me could eat them. Not even on a dare and we were eating all kinds of picketed foods and smelly cheeses all weekend."
1,Not so good,"Extremely disappointed in the quality of meat. More the texture of dog food in my opinion, and I have bought pickled sausages from around the country since 1972. Whoever wrote the review touting the quality of meat must either work there or own stock in the company. Whomever, I have a few cans of rib eye steak in a can that I will sell you for a good price."
4,Pretty good.,"These are good. I just wish they were bigger and hotter. The size and heat are a preference thing. I'm used to pickled sausages being hotter. These almost don't register heat-wise for me, but I do like spicy things. I find my self usly eating two at a time. I'm not saying they don't give you your moneys worth. The package has alot of sausages in it, and the price works out to be about 60 cents each. They are just smaller then most."
3,"Hmmmm, not that funny","This DVD has its moments but it is definitely not as funny as Vol.1. Also there is a lot more ""crude"" humor than I would like."
2,Doesnt do him justice,"They should let the fans pick the scenes that go on the DVD. Not all should be on ""best of"" in fact, how do you have multiple ""best of""."
1,"Awful material - how was it even made into a ""best of""???","I love Will Ferrell and think he's very funny. But this is very weak material from SNL. If want comedy without imagination that relies on crudeness, vulgarity and violence, then this is for you. There is not one funny skit on this DVD, and the lack of even the live audience laughing proves this as well. If I were your I wouldn't even waste my money renting it."
3,"Good, not great","I bought this to watch as I commute to work. It's pretty funny and keeps me entertained while on the bus. I especially liked the skit where he's a morning news anchor and the teleprompter stops working. Most of the skits made me laugh at least a little, but I can see it growing old fast. It's good, but not great. I definitely wouldn't buy it at full price. Watch for a deal or maybe get a used copy."
3,Not as good as Volume 1,"This is of course a good addition to all Will Ferrell lover's collections, but I found Volume 1 to be a lot funnier than Volume 2. Would recommend it, but like most sequels it comes up a little short."
1,It's like they picked the worst stuff....,"I was so excited when I saw another Best of Will coming out because I thought the first one left way too much out. However, I soon realized that the simply showed the entire skits of some segments from the first one and threw in some of his sub par skits. If I knew I would not purchase it and would discourage anyone from buying it. Who knows? Maybe they'll put out a 3rd one."
1,Believe The Bad Reviews,"As other people said before me, I couldn't be a bigger Will Ferrell fan. He's incredible. But I can't say the same for the writers of some SNL sketches or the people who choose what is put on these DVDs. I thought his first Best of DVD was pretty good (not great, but what can you do). As far as the second DVD, it's almost like NBC or whoever felt like playing a practical joke on the buying audience. None of Will's popular recurring characters showed up, and in the rare instance that they were included (Janet Reno, the lover, Actor's Studio), it was like the worst sketch was chosen. Again, Will is great, but this DVD is not. PLEASE believe the customer reviews. Save your $13 and buy Old School or Elf."
1,I can't give this as a Christmas gift!,"So I bought this DVD of volume 2 for my brother, who liked the first one a lot. A friend and I just previewed it, and IT IS TERRIBLY LAME. I mistakenly thought it would have more of Ferrell's good stuff... Celebrity Jeopardy, the Music Teacher couple, Dodge Stratus Guy, George Bush,... maybe a cheerleader sketch? There's a so much more of that stuff that they could have picked from. But seriously, whoever selected these scenes must have NO sense of humor at all. I'm going to have to find a different present for my brother, I guess."
1,No Neil Diamond Storytellers!!!!!!,"They include a storytellers sketch with Air Supply, but fail to include my favorite Will Ferrell sketch of all time. I dont even know how they picked these sketches. Dont waste your money, I would have given this zero stars if I could. And I love Will Ferrell, Volume 1 is one of my favorite DVD's."
1,A Waste of Money,"The only thing funny about it, is the fact that I spent money to buy it. A complete waste of money. Avoid!"
4,Eyes Forward!,"Will Ferrell, Deranged comic that he is, was hilarious in this 2nd entry into the SNL Collection. Ferrell's bests were Janet Reno's Dance Party, George W Bush, The Patriotic Office Guy (thong and shirt dude), Scene on an Airplane, and Wake Up, Good Morning. Will shows his range of yelling and strange tones as Air Supply, Bill Bransky, and the irrate boss interviewing a wussified Pierce Brosnan. Some of the Let Downs were The Lovers, Educator's Union, and the 2nd Robert Goulet Bit. Where was Jingleheimer Junction and where were the other Roxbury and Spartans' Sketches? This was good. NOt his best, but was OK. In the future, I'd suggest a little more Cowbell or Harry Caray- If you were a hotdog, would you eat yourself? Good effort by Ferrell and SNL. What they need is a best of the Roxbury Guys or The Ladies' Man DVDs."
2,Not worth it...,"After reading everyones reviews, I was very iffy about purchasing the second dvd. I really wanted to watch it for myself so I found it for very cheap on ebay... and yes... all the bad reviews are pretty much correct.I'm not used to doing a bad review... but this was pretty disappointing. Maybe because I watched it after the first one... which was awsome... this one left me with no laughs and a ""THATS IT??"" It basically had the full versions of the short clips that were in the first dvd.It was sad..."
1,RUN AWAY,"Don't buy this DVD--it's a TOTAL waste of money. For some reason, the compilers added a few new funny skits, but also just added the FULL skits where clips were used in Volume One. What a waste."
1,I Am Actually Compelled to Warn Others of This Disaster,"When I bought this DVD, I was all jazzed up that I would be watching more great SNL moments (after the first edition was released) of one of my favorite participants: Will Ferrell. After watching it, I not only wanted to rip the disk from the player, but I wanted to go boot the DVD out the door. I had been expecting his BEST of and all I recieved was extensions of the first volume. On the first volume, they had cute little snippets of skits that obviously didn't deserve to waste space with a joke that dragged on. I can only describe the decision of whomever picks the segments on these ""Best of"" DVDs as having inside jokes with their friends that derived from certain skits. I agree with a previous review in that buying Elf or Anchorman would be a better choice. This DVD surely stunk."
1,Lowest Common Denominator,"I am a big Will Ferrell fan and proudly own the Best of, Volume One, which highlights his multiple talents. Volume two is a huge disappointment. Not only does it have no new Jeopardies, Craig-the-Cheerleader skits, or other ""classics,"" but it seems to just be a package of his most crude, violent characters ever devised. Nonstop sketches of beatings, yellings and references to genitals gets a little old, especially when they aren't funny either. As a ""best of"" dvd, I recognized only a few of these skits at all. The one I liked and waited for--the Ted the 37-year-old-baby sketch--is great and I wish it were on the first volume. But it's not worth buying, renting or even keeping now that I have it. Hello E-bay..."
3,way better than the reviews!,this was even funnier than the first... the last 3 or 4 skits aren't too great but the rest are hilarious! i definitely recommend this dvd!
1,Unbelievable,"Stunned. That is what I am, after viewing this disc. I have never been moved to write a review like this before, but I cannot believe what I just saw. This is supposed to be funny? SNL is still on the air? (shakes head) Unbelievable.Please do not waste your money on this disc. Will Ferrell and the various nonentities who appear with him are pathetic, but what is far, far more pathetic is the so called ""writing."" These skits are sad, unfunny, and quite probably an embarrassment to the writers' parents.I rate this 1 star only because I cannot post a zero, or better yet, a negative number."
1,Waste of Money,"If you liked the first volume, but didn't think it was Ferrell's best work, then do NOT waste your time or money on this one. There was maybe three sketchs on the whole DVD that were above mediocre (the Bush intro, the teleprompter skit, and the Janet Reno skit), the rest I am at a loss for words for how they could even be considered the ""best of"" this incredible comedic talent. Some of the skits were ones that were shown on the first volume, albeit briefly. Just a really horrible, horrible job on this one. The first one missed some great skits, but this one was far worse. It is becoming pretty obvious that SNL is using these ""Best of"" DVD's not to pay tribute to some of the best comedic talent our society has ever turned out (like Ferrell, Hartman, Sandler, Farley, etc...), but just a way to make a quick buck off the fans of these comedians without having to do any work."
1,Don't waste your time,"I actually thought the first volume was pretty funny, even though they didn't include some of his best, namely anything neil diamond. I rented this one thinking I'd be laughing my butt off again, but it was a MAJOR letdown. I laughed maybe 3 times total. The choices of skits was horrible, including extended scenes from the first one. Remember that Janet Reno fighting Rudy Guliani skit from the first volume? Well thats back in entirety, but without merit, because the only funny part was that dirty fighting line, and now its old news. What the producers of these SNL best-of's need to do is set up an online poll with the skits he does, and have the true fans pick the best. What I'm guessing they did is put together another DVD really quick, hoping to capitalize on Will's recent popularity.All in all, don't even think about buying this, even if you liked the first volume. This second one isn't the real Will Ferrell, its just plain bad."
2,Only a few laughs,"This volume is definitely not as good as the first. Most of the skits included are not what I would call ""best of"" material.With the exception of a few funny moments, this is an utter waste of time and money. I am a huge fan of Will Ferrell's comedy, but he was short-changed with this DVD volume."
1,Save Your Money,"I watched this on tv in July and I was so disappointed!!!. A Will Ferrell dvd without Spartans, Jeopardy or Neil Diamond! That's criminal!! There's not that much to say about this dd. The only sketches worth watching are the opening George Bush segment, ""Lovers"", ""Red Ships Of Spain"" and ""Storytellers: Air Supply"" (featuring a funny holiday version of ""All Out Of Love"" with different lyrics). Otherwise, an abomination!!"
1,Very Very Disappointed,"Like Will Ferrill. Thought the first best of was good but disappointing (3 stars). This is even worse. If anybody only saw this they would wonder why Will is so popular. This is far from his best stuff. Starts OK with the full version of the ""patriotic meeting"" with Will in the flag thong that was cut short in the first edition, but goes steadily downhill from there. Most sketches I have never seen, forgot, or would consider ""ho-hum"", taken mostly from recent years. So boring in parts I was skipping ahead looking for a good memorable clip. It never came. Why anyone with access to so many SNL sketches would choose these is beyond me."
1,No Customer Service,"This was shipped by Debnroo and I have to say their customer service is LOUSY!!!! They shipped the wrong item - it's been two weeks and they still have not given me the option to return it AND they said the item I ordered was out of stock. Well, that is not my problem. They took my money so I should at least have the product I paid for or a refund. I highly recommend you think twice before doing business with Debnroo."
3,Not my favorite...,"I'm a big Boz fan, but was somewhat disappointed in this compilation. I've seen him perform in concert at least 5 times and have enjoyed those performances more than this group. Boz is ALWAYS good, but this particular CD will not be one of the ones I wear out from continuous usage!"
2,A surprising disappointment,"Although I am a Boz Scaggs fan - I was surprised to find this set of CDs to be a disappointment. As many artists will, Boz takes a new direction with most of the songs in these performances. His interpretations are well outside the bounds what what I had expected. Unfortunately I don't think these new directions benefitted the recordings in most cases. Its a shame because I really do (otherwise) like his style."
5,Boz is back with a BANG!,"This is excellent Boz Scaggs. His reprise of oldies is not only technically better but the renderings are far more articulate and wonderfully sung and orchestrated than the originals. Boz's voice is now mature and his styling is better than ever. If you're a Boz fan and liked the originals, you'll love the new renditions of your old favorites. Great album."
4,good to have a cd version of a great video,"My main purpose of getting this Cd was to have just the music associated with the video that I also possess.So many times its handy to listen to the music, especially if it is well recorded, which it is here, withouthaving to watch the video. I'll have to say, though, that these songs seem to have more impact when there is the visual element added to it. That only highlights Mr Scaggs', and his band's, considerable talent as live performers.Despite that, I feel certain that all of these performances are going to continue grow on me with repeated listening."
5,Boz Scaggs CD,This is a world class collection of music by this artist. One of the best compliations I've heard! Love every song!
5,Boz - Better Than Ever,"A stunning album. Well-recorded with a tight band at the Great American Music Hall. You will find all the usual hits that you seek. The biggest and most awesome surprise in on disc 2, a track entitled ""Runnin' Blue"". A full-blown big band blues tune, this will check the quality of your speakers and your ears, nearly a reference quality track, and from a live album at that. A super treat to listen to, put it on and rock. Very, very well done. Just fantastic!"
5,Boz is like a Fine Wine...He just keeps getting better,"After purchasing the DVD, I purchased the CD shortly there after. Boz and the musicians are incredible. Totally ""Classy"". I love and own many music DVD performances, but this DVD and CD rank as one of my favorites. If you purchase the DVD, go to the special features section, and notice how Boz treats his musicians. He treats them with respect and love. As for the music and performance, """"Boz is like a Fine Wine...He just keeps getting better"""
5,Boz Scaggs Greatest Hits,"This is Boz at his best. All the greatest hits included in 2 volume set. If you are a fan this is a definate ""must have"" for your collection!"
4,Fun for the whole family,"I had one issue - the first one I bought lost the power supply in the first hour! I looked at some reviews on the Internet and this seems to be common. That I don't like. However, they replaced it right away, (Musician's Friend), and the new one seems to be OK so far.On the good side - I took this thing to an Easter get-together with family. Everyone was amazed! They all had to try it, and it became like Karaoke. I would let them sing and would play with the effects. Even got our little niece to join in. It was a blast.So even if you're not a professional singer, this can be fun to play with. Similar to Karaoke, everyone will want to try it! Since I'm not a professional guitar player, I haven't used it to it's full potential yet, but as I get better this thing will be a lot of fun I can tell!"
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I would have rated this product zero stars if the option was available. We acquired this item from Amazon.com a year or so ago. Not long after, we noticed it was crazing. Just now, I pulled it out of the dishwasher and it fell apart into 5 large pieces. We only ever used it in the oven (never over 425 degrees) and washed it in the dishwasher, both of which are considered appropriate uses.I figured $40 for a single baking dish was somewhat high, but went with it anyway, figuring you get what you pay for. Talk about disappointed! My mother has baking dishes of far lesser value that she has used for all of her 58 years of marriage.Whatever happened to value, anyway? I wouldn't buy another Chantal product if you paid me."
5,the best album of all time!!!!!,this is hip hop beyond it's time!! kool keith has really put himself into the number 1b. slot behind RAKIM!! THIS ALBUM IS FOR TRUE HIP-HOP HEADS!!!
5,Wow,"This album still sounds as fresh as it did when i first heard it over 10 years ago, i believe this album raised the creative level in hip hop at the time. Keith and Ced Gee were great with their back and forth ryhme style. Nice beats, nice everything...Definetely one of the top 5 hip hop albums of all time, if not the best in my opinion"
5,Classic light years ahead of its time.,"Heavy bass drops, dope scratching, original lyrics and flows. Kool Keith's one of a kind style was so advanced back then that he has'nt changed it much at all over the years. Ced G kind of reminds me of the RZA, mabe the RZA was influenced by him. TR Love's excessive scratching is some of the greatest I have ever heard aside from Mr Dibbs, and Buck 65. Hands down illest old school album in my book. Buy this for your collection you won't be dissapointed."
5,A MUST BUY,"I YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE A TRUE HIP HOP HEAD, THIS RECORDING IS A MUST HAVE. THIS IS THE GREATEST HIP HOP RECORD EVER MADE...PERIOD...IF YOU DON'T OWN A COPY OF THIS ALBUM, YOUR NOT A REAL HEAD, AND OBVIOUSLY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS ARTFORM AND ITS CULTURE."
3,"""prodigy's favorite rapper""?","who cares? anyway, this album was not as good as I expected it to be. I was surprised to hear something so predictable from the likes of Kool Keith. Ced Gee's beats are all based on the typical JB/Meters samples of the era, and the rhymes basically follow the same rhythm on every track. Still a good CD, but when stacked up against the greats of the mid-late 80's (eric b and rakim, pe, boogie down) this one falls short."
5,The finest example of pre-licensing sample music,"I wouldn't profess to be a historian, but Critical Beatdown is, imho, the best hip-hop album recorded in the raw-cut 'golden age' of pre-licensed sampling.These tunes are just sooo rich - count many tasty long breaks on each track, opposed to the one-licensed-break per record that (has to) suffice now.That is before one comes to Kool Keith or a fine performance by his fellows. The lyrics are fine, if a little braggin', delivery (esp. Keith) is just splendid. Dr Octagon is Kool Keith's modern incarnation."
3,Average Expository Writing,This book captures the emotions of expository writing. It really motivates my writing because I am a sensitive guy. I think that this book does not give new and interesting ways to write expository papers. If you are looking for a general idea this is the book for you.
1,Annoying. Really Annoying.,"This is sort of the worst possible version of Rounders, which was likeable film about one man's journey of self-discovery, which is spurred on by his pain-in-the-neck best friend. In Rounders, it works because the best friend, although impossible, has depth. You understand him, his priciples (such as they are), and you know that a guy who won't compromise makes for an explosive combination in the environment we find ourselves in Rounders. But in Made, the best friend has no depth. He's just a jerk. He's a jerk through the whole movie, and he annoys the audidence as much as anyone else, so much so that you have a hard time following the story, and hardly even notice the main character's progress. Perhaps the jerk was supposed to be funny, and if so, maybe that could have carried the film. But he's not funny. He's not compelling. He's not interesting. He's a jerk, and living with him for two hours is two hours too long."
4,Vaughn is hilarious,"this is about Bobby(Jon Favreau) and he is a wanna be boxer who also does construction work..so is his friend Ricky(Vince Vaughn)..Bobby has a girlfriend who is a stripper named Jessica(a sexy Famke Janssen)....Favreau and Vaughn are assigned a job by Max(Peter Falk)...so he sends the 2 away with the help of Ruis(SEan Combs), his right hand man (Faison Love) and a limo driver(Vincent Pastore)....very funny due to teh chemistry of Favreau and Vaughn...bringing their Swingers chemistry to the picture..especially Vaughn..he gets all the highlights..beeping the stewardess on the plane...annoying Falk and Combs..and the chuckie cheese part at the end...very good and worth it if your fans of the Swingers cast"
3,Just Not That Funny,"The title of my review says it all. The plot set-up is pretty solid, but the rest of the movie just isn't that funny. Vince Vaughn has his funny rambling moments as he does in all of his flicks, but the pacing is off, the dialogue is a bit meandering and...rent it if you're a Vaughn fan."
1,"Tried to like it, and failed...","I tried very hard to like this movie because I enjoyed Swingers so much. Regrettably, I just couldn't sit through it.Even though the production value of the film looks surprisingly high for it's budget, the plot moves at a slow pace and the hand-held camera work is jittery and disorienting.As bad as the above mentioned factors are, the true reason for this film's failure is the constant annoyance of Vince Vaughn's character. In fact, this character is so grating that it reminded me of ""Jar Jar Binks"" from ""Star Wars Episode 1"": Hapless, dim-witted, and the cause of a lot of trouble for his loyal friends. By the middle of the movie, I was so irritated by this character that I just couldn't stomach the film anymore.In the end, I would characterize this movie as a true disappointment for any Favreau fan."
2,Boring,"Vince Vaughn's character was extremely annoying, at one point I just wanted him to get whacked so that he would shut up for once. Jon Favreau was alright, at least he didn't talk so much. Famke is very pretty and her acting is good, but whoever wrote her two-scene-role (Favreau, I suppose) did a lousy job. First she's that normal girl stuck with the wrong job, next thing she's a crackhead. What in the world happened? The two stars go for Puffy, very impressed with his appearence, even though I don't like his music. I was pretty much bored the whole time watching this movie, lacked any sense at all, I'd rather be watching the News at 11, if you know what I mean. Just my 2 cents."
2,"Stupid film, looks like it was written by 12 year olds.","DOn't bother with this one. Though I am a HUGE fan of Swingers and the Sopranos. (Some of the cast is used in this film) I cannot recommend you watch this moive. It's about 2 incompetant, small time thugs. One who wants out of the Mob and to settle down with his stripper girlfriend and her daughter. The other wanting to be a bigger part of the Mob, but with the brain power of a gnat. It's more annnoying than funny. Like a bad imitation of Dumb and Dumber."
2,Note to Favreau...,Obnoxious and annoying is not the same as funny. Vince's Ricky character was not one bit funny and pretty much ruined it for me. I was hoping time and time again he would just get killed off. Unfortunately he wasn't. I only wish I had rented this instead of bought it. Not a good follow up to Swingers at all.
2,It's Vince or Not Vince......,"How well you like this movie may depend on how well you take to the character played by Vince Vaughn. He is deliberately boorish, obnoxious, obtuse and irritating. Now, this can work in a movie at times, but for me, Vaughn's character was like fingernails on a blackboard and I was praying half way through the movie that, comedy or no, somebody would kill this jerk! Since I couldn't stand this lout after awhile, and since he is onscreen virtually the entire film, I couldn't wait for this exercise in irritation to end.If, however, you don't mind this character the movie is a none-to-exceptional, but okay urban/gangster comedy."
3,Not Swingers II,"I'd actually give this two and a half stars. Do not watch this movie expecting to see Swingers II. The problem with this movie is that Vince Vaughn's character is very annoying to watch. Its almost uncomfortable to watch how he make a fool of himself.The reason this movie gets 2 1/2 stars though is that, like Swingers, Vaughn has classic quotes that you and your buddies can laugh heartily at during poker night. The lines, by themselves, are as classic as some lines from Swingers, but Swingers is still 2nd to none in that regard."
1,This...Show Was...really...Worthless,"Not only was the shallow plot poorly acted there would have been only three (3) lines of dialog in this movie if the F-word was eliminated from the script, assuming there was a script...Not much thought seemed to have gone into the script so there's not much to get out of it. If this movie had a humorous plot it certainly got lost in the lack of coherence that permeated each scene, if there were scenes. It wasn't worth the effort to try to follow or care where the plot, or lack thereof, was going. Don't bother."
4,its made,"this movie, made, was great, it has everything-wit, good humor, and action, i think the guys from swingers have done it again! i gave this movie 4 stars because i really enjoyed it and i think anybody who sees this will enjoy it too if you like wit,good humor and action!"
1,Did others watch the same movie???,"Boring and stupid. Do not waste your money. I wanted to rent this from NetFlix but they didn't have it. Now I know why. Instead we bought it and would now like to take it back. There were four of us watching it and 2 of them fell asleep. The rest of us watched Spy Kids after watching Made and it was better.While the one character was somewhat funny for awhile, his attitude and stupidity grew old quickly. The acting was good maybe even great but the plot was limp. It could have been a great storyline had they added more content.We watched the Outtakes hoping to see something funnier. WRONG! These were the worst outtakes I have ever seen and believe me, I watch a ton of movies!"
1,You will wish you had never seen this movie..,"This movie left me sick to my stomach. Prior comments on this movie are obviously tounge-in-cheek, but folks, c'mon, this was garbage- plain and simple. For the length of the movie, we follow two friends, who have a running gag of always engaging in petty pushing contests, and act boorishly for the sake of a few laughs.P Diddy's role in the film is diminutive, and Vincent Pastore is used sparingly - playing a limo driver, what a shame..This movie never really blossomed into a sophisticated and enthralling crime escapade movie, however conversely sunk deep into the lethargic torpor of bad jokes and poor acting. This movie was not ha ha funny, and the plot certainly didn't grab hold of you, it was just marginal..Please, don't waste your time. If you like this genre of movie, stick to Snatch or LSTSM, which are both masterpieces."
2,cool average film,this film was a Cool Average film.it didn't last long&that was a plus.some funny stuff in spots but you can tell it was very 2nd-tier in alot of spots.it was thin on overall story substance but it was a Average film worth peeking out for a few laughs.
2,Ouch.,"As much as I have enjoyed John's work in the past, I was sorely disappointed with this movie.Having read other reviewer's opinions, I know that it was made on a very small budget. I realize that John wrote, directed, produced and starred in the movie. Let's face it. The man had a lot going on.Unfortunately, I think that the writing for this movie got away from John. I really really wanted to enjoy this movie, and was hoping that I had found a hidden treasure. Unfortunately, in hindsight, I don't feel like this was the case.The character Vince Vaugh plays is polar opposite from the character he played in swingers. It's the same guy, but instead of being hip and sheek, he's geeky ... John's character just never really develops.I am looking forward to his next effort, and will buy whatever he makes, but I do feel a little bit let down by this effort."
2,nothing like the swingers,"For those of you considering this movie because you loved The Swingers, I strongly discourage you to buy this movie.It's nothing like The Swingers, it doesn't have the smart dialogue, good charicter interaction and it definitely lacks humor. Throughout the whole movie not only did I not laugh but this movie failed to get any kind of response from me. So don't make the same mistake I did by purchasing this movie!"
4,"""Made"" Review","I don't see why people say ""Most wont like it."" I thought it was pretty funny. I got this DVD for $5 a Walmart, but I would have paid full price. I think anyone instrested in the Mafia humor should check this out. Anyone in general should check this out, it's not bad at all."
4,very funny but a little too much,"i am a huge swingers fan. but, this film was a lot different. it was extremely funny and i liked the ways they made me laugh. but, i could have done without all the strong language. it seemed like they dropped f-bombs in their just to get an R rating. otherwise a well made film and a funny one at that."
1,Jon Favreau MADE garbage,"Wow, in my life I have never been so wrong about a movie. After seeing Swingers I couldn't imagine that Favreau would bomb so badly in a movie. I figured the movie would at least be decent.The characters have no character, the plot has no plot. Just two hours of annoying, pointless conversations.And then at the end they hit us with a big politically correct ending, it turns out the tension between the two main characters is resolved when they established a suspiciously homosexual-like relationship.I now own a worthless DVD that I will never ever watch again. Save your money, folks."
1,After the greatness of Swingers we get this tripe ?,"Vince Vaughn's character was so overdone as to make this film impossible to watch. My wife stopped 15 minutes into it, I made it a little over 45 minutes. This is what we got from the guys who made swingers ? It's just plain awful.The plot could have worked out to be funny, but instead of being funny, it just got tired. Vince Vaughn plays a clueless slacker who uses his friend to get work and wants badly to be a gangster like he's seen in movies such as ""Casino"". Now, if the part had been played properly, it would have come off funny, instead, it just gets more and more grating by the minute. I really wished his character would have been killed off early.The plot was pretty good, but VV's character was , as I've said, so overdone and annoying, you just can't take it."
1,Wanted to like it....hated it.,"I am really mad at Vince Vaughn and his buddy, Favreau. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, and I try to be selective about my choices. Sean Combs is an absolute embarrassment to the field of acting. There were some Sopranos cameos which served as a distraction for this sad piece of celluloid. Terrible. Awful. I want my money back."
1,made a bad movie,"Although I liked swingers, and favreau and vaughn have great chemistry, this movie just did not come together at all. This suprised me though, because I really enjoyed swingers and expected great things from this flick. The plot also had great potential, but it just never did develop at all. Vaughn was hilarious in swingers, despite his relentless ""force feeding"" of his style.In made, he just came across as a pointless, obnoxious, never has been and never will be kind of character.I own over 200 dvd's and I only buy great movies.I forgive him and favreau though, because I liked swingers so much, and Im sure they will produce some good materieal in the future, but please take my word for it, this movie was a bomb."
5,great service,Book arrived very quickly and was in excellent condition. Will certainly order from them again.
3,could have been better,"Well I've read several other books by Flora Speer and I've always enjoyed them. This one was ok, not great. The back cover sounded better than the story turned out to be. There really wasn't much interaction between the hero and the heroine. Even the love scenes were so mild I wasn't sure that they had done anything. The Hero Dain has agreed to marry the daughter of his enemy to settle a feud that has been going on for generations. Emma, the heroine is sent instead of her 7 year old sickly sister. She is a magician but fears that if she tells Dain the truth he will hurt her in some way. She falls for him and he is hopelessly drawn to her even though he fights it. I didn't like the fact that he had very short cropped hair which looks like on the cover like it's been bleached. He looks too modern. I think this could have been a better book with a bit more passion in it and more interaction between the main characters."
3,Powerful Vibration but Very Dense,"I have memory foam pillows and a mattress topper which are super comfortable so I was excited about the additional massaging action in the neck pillow. However, the foam in the neck pillow seams to be really dense, unlike my other pillows, and it gives more ""support"" than ""cushion."" My neck doesn't sink into the foam. The density; however, most likely is the reason the vibration seems to travel throughout the entire pillow very nicely. I was thinking it might be a little noisy to other passengers when on a plane, but not bad enough to prevent me from using it. :D"
2,Hard...,I thought one of the reviewers was exaggerating but I guess not. Hard as a rock is a good description. I returned it. It doesn't feel like memory foam... it felt like block foam.
2,Less than impressed,The massage is just a NOISY buzzing motor - very annoying when you're trying to relax. The memory foam crushes at the back of the neck while the part around the front remains plump and awkward. We took the noisy vibration contraption out of it and still don't like it.
5,Massage Neck Pillow,"I bought the massage pillow for a friend. Her husband had a stroke and he has problem with his shoulder. I told her she could use it on his shoulder. I have one that I bought a couple of years ago, that I use all the time."
1,Don't buy.,Rigid as a rock. Zero comport level. Return shipping will cost me almost the price. Now I'm stuck with this horrible neck rest.
5,"The ""Strunk and White"" for Speech Recognition","Author, Bruce Balentine's goal with How to Build a Speech Recognition Application is to produce the Strunk and White of speech recognition. An electronic musician and composer, Balentine was a pioneer in the speech recognition field. The text's examination of the problems of navigation from human perception to machine recognition give comprehension to even the layman. The book is well organized and structured with the +,/,- system which allows a novice to follow. According to linguist, Dr. John White, the first chapter could stand alone as a treatise on the dynamics of the human speech interface with the machine."
5,A definitive resource for telephony professionals,"This book is a definitive resource for any professional seeking to design a clean, usable and rock-solid telephony interface. In fact, the book takes you beyond speech recognition per se and helps you to understand the logic and heuristics of good telephone interface design. I highly recommend this text for anyone who is putting together a new system or has to re-do an existing one."
5,Stunning Remastering and Great Extras Make this a Winner,"Yes, the original production was brilliant for its time. Great songs, superb production, an album that arrived just slightly before its time and remains timeless. What you really want to know however, is ""Should I buy this version or upgrade my standard version to it?"" The answer is an enthusiastic, ""Yes!"" The remastering makes this sound as if it were recorded yesterday, the bonuses (20 tracks!) are fantastic as they encompass not only b-sides and remixes, but live recordings from the era that have also been cleaned up to match the quality of the studio recordings. Not all remastered or deluxe editions are worth the price of upgrade, but this one truly shines."
3,as easy as ABC,"As great as ABC's Lexicon of LOve was an an album, this deluxe edition did not do much for me."
2,Poor durability,"I liked this sprinkler at first. As another reviewer said, the dial to control how far this sprinkler sprays in either direction actually works rather well.Unfortunately, it didn't hold up well at all. After about 10 uses, one of he nozzles only sprayed about half as high as the others, which meant that the evenness of the water distribution was diminished. Over the next month, another nozzle would suffer this same problem each week, so that now the sprinkler is only about half functional.I'm guessing that the nozzles are getting clogged. It wouldn't cost very much for the manufacturer to include a metal screen to minimize this issue."
2,Hose connector broke - flimsy plastic,"I was rolling my hose up and forgot to disconnect the sprinkler first. Just dragging it across the yard was enough to snap off the plastic part that connects the black hose connector to the body of the unit.This is unfortunate, as otherwise it seemed to work well. The knob to control how far the sprinkler would go in each direction worked well and was convenient."
4,Very comfortable mattress for the money,I got 2 of these mattresses for my boys loft beds and have been very happy with them. I was concerned they may not be comfortable since they are just foam but I have had the opportunity to test them out myself if my boys had nightmares in thne night. They are soft yet supportive. The only drawback is they can be hard to put sheets on because the foam isn't as firm as a regular mattress and the depth of the mattress is much smaller than most.
5,a twist of botti,Chris B. is an outstanding player who surrounds himself with extraordinary 'staff' I needed to complete my Botti library with this CD and was not dissappointed.
3,I ripped 4 songs to Zune,"I'm a fan of The Blue Nile, which lead me to this little recording in the mid-nineties. It's jazzy. It's smooth. It's boring. Still, those few bits worth owning make the whole thing worth owning, if your music budget allows.The Blue Nile do their inimitable good work backing the highly-recommended ""Forgiven""--a vocal piece worth the purchase price of the CD. Chris Botti plays his mean reed, and all is well with the instrumentation and arrangements.The problem, if there is one, is this: way, way too many of the pieces are those little, one- to two-minute bits that hearken back to the old days, when writers were not compensated for soundtrack work, and ""movie music"" was throw away stuff. One remembers break-out work, like ""To Live and Die in L.A."", and ""Blade Runner"", which defined stand-alone music in soundtracks.Still, some of this stuff is really good. It really is. Give a listen if you have the time. Buy it if you have a broad collection."
2,Critical Analysis of Teilhard,"I was surprised that there were no reviews of this book. It deserves at least one. I disagree with the author, but I'll try to be positive anyway. The author states that his ""analysis of Teilhard's work is highly critical."" That it definitely is. The author dislikes the ""New Age"" movement, declares that Darwinism is not a scientific fact, and links Teilhard to both. But this book contains detailed research, footnotes (not end notes, hurray!), a pair of indexes, and was published by an academic press, presumably with peer review. The foreword was from the dean of the Southern Evangelical Seminary in North Carolina. So, if you share the author's opinions, then you should find this book quite valuable. And if you prefer Teilhard's theories, this book is at least worth taking a look at just to read some objections. I gave the book two stars for content (I accept evolution), but the writing, editing and research are first class."
5,Entertaining ... and informative,"I enjoyed it. The title sounds like a college textbook, but the style is very conversational and there are stories on every page. The author clearly relishes his subject. The writing is crisp and the humor is understated. He puts the cattle business in a very helpful historical perspective. Although it's not a page turner, I always looked forward to picking it up. I also expect to get more out of it the next time I read it."
5,A Must for young Boys!,"I picked this up for my 10 year old for X-mas, and while he hasn't read or received it yet, I did read enough beforehand and after I got it to know he will love this book. Its got everything a little boy wants; butts, farts, zombies, adventure! And while my little guy loves to read, I know this is the type of book that will capture his interest even more and he won't be able to put it down! Its very gross and therefore very enthralling!"
1,Not even interesting,"My grandson lost interest in this book in a few minutes, said it was boring. I do not recommend."
4,Deeply Moving,"It is horrifying to hear this story as told by those who lived its pain. As I say this, I think ""please read it"" so we don't let it happen again. I was moved to tears by some of the first hand accounts of the massacre. It is a stellar academic work. The only reason I gave it four stars was this...it reads slowly and slightly repetitively. I read more fiction (historical fiction is the best), so I am used to a faster pace."
3,He doesn't seem like a very happy man,"These poems are mostly of unrequited love/lust. Some of them are moveing. It certainly shows that Dalai Lama's can be subject to the pains of Samsara. I think the introduction to the book sums it up when it says that he was either an advanced tantric master of mysterious methods or a false Dalai Lama. There are two versions of this book available. The one pre-fixed ""The Turquoise Bee"" is the better presented one."
1,"Hum it, he'll sing it",It's just the sort of thing which would appeal to a professor of Perception and Philosophy somewhere in an obscure university. Rather wishy-washy. But then again it makes a change from the usual hand-me-downs from the other sutra-reading throng.
4,Derangement,"I was completely surprised by how much I enjoyed this film which was well-written and professionally produced. I found Brian Hasenfus, the actor in the leading role, to be particularly compelling and likable and his characterization of a man/child on the cusp of assuming adult responsibility touched me deeply. Not all goes according to plan, however, as temptation in the form of a sexually enticing high school student who is trying to make her inattentive boyfriend jealous ultimately derails the protagonist's plans in ways he could never have anticipated. The atmosphere of Philip The Fossil is pervaded by alcohol, cocaine and huge doses of steroids which converts a seemingly placid suburb in Massachusetts into a simmering recipe for disaster. Shot in an effective verite style with a great deal of edgy editing, the film is absorbing and suspenseful and I was sad to see it end after being treated to only one hour and thirteen minutes of highly creative film-making."
5,Clean water and ice!,Filters fit well and make the water and ice taste great. The twin pack allows you to have a backup in case the filter gets full before you realize it.
2,"Fits the fridge, but water still has same odd taste","This product does fit my fridge, but unfortunately, I noticed absolutely no difference in the taste of the water coming out of the fridge. Also, after I installed this product, it seemed like the water would never stop running from the dispenser the first time I activated the dispenser. I ended up with a bit of a pool of water in front of the fridge. I'm not sure if this has happened to anyone else, but just be aware that you might want to have a small bucket or a bunch of cups ready just in case the water dispenser doesn't turn off right away the first time you use it after replacing the water filter.I may have to try to slighly more expensive unit to see if that makes any difference on the taste of the water."
5,All about the deal,"Like so many reviews I write on here, this one is about the value not the product. Let's face it, if your fridge takes these then you buy them and put them in... whether or not they do what they should is anyone's guess, right? But, since you do have to buy them and put them in, buy these since they're cheaper than you can get them anywhere else, or than buying them one at a time. (If you're like me, you will extend the life of these filters by leaving them in for 2 cycles instead of changing it when they recommend.)"
5,Whirlpool water filter,This is a PUR water filter for the Whirlpool refrigerator. My frig is about 10 years old and takes this filter. Not all whirlpool filters are the same. Its important to make sure the serial number matches. Took about 30 seconds to install and the water tastes great.
5,"just as described, came quickly, works well","What can I say? You order what you need, get a good price, it arrives quickly and as ordered, and works fine. Ahhh. Life is good, or at least the water is."
5,Refrigerator water filter (whirlpool),I am very pleased with the water from this filter. I would buy it again.
2,Bait and Switch?????,"I don't know how this will compare to the REAL ""Whirlpool"" filter which I thought that I was getting! It says that it is made by Water Sentinel. That is not how it is presented so I am very disappointed."
4,Good filter,Standard replacement filter for fridge. Works fine. Lasts 6 months. It could be cheaper but it is convenient and improves the taste of water for drinking and coffee. Shipment wasn't super quick but it wasn't bad either.
1,NOT A WHIRLPOOL BRAND FILTER,"Like some other reviewers recently, I did not receive a genuine Whirlpool filter as pictured in the description. I received a ""Water Sentinel"" brand filter. I does fit the refrigerator--mine takes the filter in the lower grille (but it's a Kenmore made by Whirlpool). However, it's not what I believed I was purchasing. The filter itself is very lightweight which makes me question if there's as much going on on the inside as there is in a genuine whirlpool filter. Yes, the price is cheap. No, I'm not going through the hassle of returning it. But buyer beware! :("
1,FREE SHIPPING OFFER BY FILTERSFAST NOT HONORED,"Feedback I left regarding a recent order with FiltersFast was removed, so I'm reposting. I purchased 3 filters from FiltersFast pursuant to a BUY 3 AND GET FREE SHIPPING offer, which the ad stated SHIPS FROM AND SOLD BY FILTERSFAST, however I was charged for shipping. FiltersFast admits the ad is misleading and a violation of amazon's policies that prohibit sellers from posting seller-specific info, such as free shipping offers, in product descriptions, but refused to issue a refund.Date: 5/19/08 Rated by Buyer: jcaffarella"
1,Generic filter being substituted as Whirlpool brand,"I purchased Whirlpool filters (item 4396508) as shown in the photo and described in the description. I received generic Water Sentinel filters. Probably an honest mistake, but if I wanted generic filters, I would have ordered them. I will be returning them."
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought this replacement filter because it was 15 bucks cheaper than the exact model offered on the KitchenAid website... It allowed giant particles to escape the filter... In other words, it didn't filter the water at all... I finally bought the same filter from the manufacturer's website, and it works perfectly... Don't buy this filter off Amazon..."
5,Excellent experience.,Great price...very competitive pricing and fast(free!)shipping...and no sales tax!!!Saved time & gas by not having to find & go to a parts store.Would recommend to anyone needing to replace their water filter.I will be using Amazon for my next filter when it needs replacing.
5,Great Deal,"I buy one of these every 6 months for the frig to keep fresh water around for the kids and cooking. Always works great, this one was a great deal. Will be back in 6 more months!"
4,Good price for Kitchen Aid water filter,"Once again, Amazon had the best price for these Kitchen Aid water filter. Happy with purchase and save some money as well."
4,Works Great,"Easy to install, after spilling about 30 cups its ready to use. Ive noticed that it needs to be replaced a month or two earlier than its supposed to. But the water tastes great."
4,Easy to Install,"The filter was the proper fit for my refrigerator. I needed to use the instructions that came with the frig, and then it installed very easily."
5,"Good deal, OEM parts.","I went a loooooooooooooong time before changing these out, but I am glad I did. This product is the same exact product that came with my fridge and worked excellent."
5,Whirlpool Water Filter,Item was exactly as described and arrived quickly. Will order again when needed since the cost was significantly cheaper than buying in the store.
5,Quickest delivery ever!,I ordered one of these filters at 8 AM on 12/23/09 and received it at 4:40 PM on 12/23/09. This is the fastest I've ever received an item from anyone. I still can't believe how quickly it arrived. I assume that it is the same filter that I used before. i won't know anything else about the filter until I actually use it in about 9 or 10 months.
4,Water Filter,Product is very easy to install and operates well within 1-2 minutes. No black specks or metallic / plastic tastes as described with related lower priced products.
5,How much can you say about a water filter?,IT WORKS. The price is right and i have it at my door which keeps me from going out to pick one up. I never remember so i just keep ordering it here.
1,The bad reviews are right.,"It imparted a very bad taste and smell to water that was obvious within few hours. After I replaced it with the one bought from best buy, the water was fine. I have returned it for refund."
4,Refridgerator Filter,"Although it is annoying to have to purchase a water filter every 6 months, I do enjoy knowing that impurities are filtered even more than our parish filtration. This product arrived promptly and is easy to install."
5,great,"great replacemeant, for a good price. works perfectly in my frig. i will definetly buy another one. nice job you guys."
5,Whirlpool Frig Filters,"Rec'd order promptly and it seems to be working just fine. Cheaper than buying locally or thru Whirlpool. Seems to be a original mfg item, not a knock off."
5,frig filter,Exactly what we ordered. Came earlier than was estimated. Great service and the price was a substantial savings over store price. Thanks
5,Much Better Price!,"This is the exact filter our refrigerator came with, at a fraction of the price of appliance stores. Sometimes you have to use pliers if the old filter doesn't turn easily. Just protect the plastic cover with an old rag so the pliers don't damage the plastic on the refrigerator and twist counterclockwise. Be sure to run a gallon or so through a pitcher before drinking and put the clear reminder sticker inside the door so you will know when it is time to change the filter again."
4,Genuine Whirlpool replacement filter,"Unlike other reviewers' experiences, the product I received was a genuine Whirlpool product that uses the Pur filtration system, not a generic 3rd party filter. For reference, my order date was 8/21/11. Replacing the filter in my refrigerator was simple and took less than a minute."
4,Genuine Whirlpool filter,"There are a couple of reviews for this product from October 2010 which state that a generic item was received instead of a Whirlpool-brand filter. I was concerned by these reviews and called Amazon to confirm this item before placing my order. Yesterday the filter arrived and it is *not* a generic brand. The filter I received is from Whirlpool, as advertised.The filter works perfectly. Water flows smoothly and tastes good. Just make sure to follow the instructions and run about 3 gallons through the filter before drinking water from it (this is common for all filters)."
5,Real Value !!,Why didn't I think about it earlier? That was my thought process when I ordered this and when I was replacing my used one. I was a little skeptical when I ordered this 'cause I used to pay almost same price for one when I used to buy it from my local Sears store. Here I got pack of two for the same price. I could have saved so much money over the years! oh well!!It looks genuine and I trust Amazon for most part. So far it's working as it should be.
4,convenient,"This is an effective product that makes drinking water easily accessible and affordable. We both are drinking more water because of this product. Also, this model is rarely available in retail stores. Highly recommended."
3,Fits my fridge and cleans my drinking water,"I would prefer if there was a subscribe and save option, but the price is still better than what I have see around my house,"
5,quick shipping and the correct item,"quick shipping and the correct item arrived. I would order again from this seller.At first I was concerned when the filter said ""4396508P"" and it didn't go in as easy as I expected. Searched around a bit and found that this model is the same filter as ""4396509"" which I was replacing."
4,Whirlpool water filter,"The order was delivered promptly, even before the date suggested in the order. The product matches all specifications"
1,wrong item,I did not like this item because it was the wrong one. It did not fit my refrigerator and therefore I returned it.
1,Not a 3-pack,"I thought I was getting a good deal, but it turns out it's not the 3-pack. Just one. Lesson learned."
4,water filters,This was the best value I could find on the internet. Too bad there isn't a generic filter. The price is still high.
4,No Problems,"Ordered and received within a few days, good instructions for installation. Overall no problems, beats driving around town searching for the right filters."
1,IT DOES NOT FIT MY REFIGERATOR,WELL IT DID NOT FIT MY KITCHENAID REF MODELKSRB25FRBX02. I WILL RETURN IT SOON. i HOPE I WILL GET THE RIGHT PRODUCT NEXT TIME
4,Filter,Filter is fine but water seems to have taste. Maybe because haven't run that much water through it. We have reverse osmosis system at sink that I drink more water from.
5,Water filter,The price was great. Shipping was fast. Product works and fits just as advertised. Will purchase again as the price is the attractive part of this purchase. Part fits and works exactly as expected.
1,"Not as Advertised. Used, not New!","Filter was advertised as New, When Received Box had been opened before and was taped shut with Scotch Tape. Filter was in box without plastic seal. This was obviously a returned possibly used filter. Very disappointed."
3,Karl Hansen,"Seems silly to review a filter. Still, I'm going to. Not so much the filter but the online purchase. I shop'd around and the price here was the lowest. Add ground shipping and it was still not worth it to me to drive out and buy the unit locally. I found the same filter for as much as $20 more. I also received the filter I ordered --- which is nice --- and it fit! Nice work Amazon :) Does it make a difference in the fridge? I don't have a clue. The girlfriend insisted it be changed...and so it was. Me, I drink rum... Not fridge water. And I really don't care if my ice cubes are from filtered water or not! CHEERS!"
1,Sorry Wrong number....,"I should have done my homework better. For some reason I got a ""boy"" filter when I needed a ""girl"" filter... I probably shouldn't blame that on the filter, I mean it looks very nice but I have no use for it. I bought the correct one somewhere else."
2,turbodawg,"refrig filters are minimally effective, and a waste of money. Water quality is about the same as tap water, even consumer report rates these type filters as poor."
1,Water taste like rust,purchased this filter in December my water started to taste like rust after 3 months. my top water taste bather w/out filter.wouldn't buy this product again will try some other brands.filter should last 6 months not 3.is there warranty on this thing i need replacement.
1,This is not the Whirlpool product,I was surprised that I didn't get what the photo showed. I thought I ordered the Whirlpool product that was pictured. Instead I got a compatible product but not the real deal. If you want a knock off then you can get it a lot cheaper elsewhere. Bogus
1,Whirlpool Filter,I just recieved another brand some after market not the item advertised as Whirlpool.This filter compared to Whirlppol is not the same if you shake it it has something inside that moves. It does not seem to be similar in quality. I do not know why this is not corrected yet on Amazon it still shows Whirlpool product and picture and you recieve a product as Water Sentinel. I did recieve a credit for the error after a few calls so customer service was okay.
1,Not pleased at all,"I bought this 2 pack of water filters thinking I could save money by getting two at once. They fit right and seemed okay but the water tasted nasty even after flushing gallons through the system. I wrote it off as a bad filter. Put the second one in and it's slightly better but the water still has this weird taste. I will never order this type of filter again (I assumed with the 'Pur' name on it, it would be okay). I'm also assuming they were new and not used, but either way, I am not pleased with this purchase. I just ordered a different filter that is a 'Kenmore' as I've used in the past."
2,Short Life,"I rarely use my in-door water dispenser. I only use ice. As much as these filters cost, they should last longer than 3 months. I do like the ease of ordering."
4,water filter,"The product arrived quickly. The price was the lowest around. The packaging was the only thing that was questionable. It made me wonder where they got the filter? Other than that, it has performed fine and the water quality seems to be as good as the factory filter that came with the fridge."
5,Great product,Was exactly what I was looking for and $15 cheaper then at the Sears store I've been buying at for the last 9 years!
5,Great value,"Its a water filter, water tastes fine/works like it should, cheaper than anywhere else that I checked online! Go Cowboys!"
5,Clean Water!,Such a great price for the water filter online. Best buy sells it for double and some for the same product.
3,Whirlpool 4396508P KitchenAid Maytag Side-by-Side Refrigerator Water...,Whirlpool 4396508P KitchenAid Maytag Side-by-Side Refrigerator Water... was one of those tings better bought on line than in the store where we bought the appliances.
5,works,loved saving the extra money for the same product thank you! very easy to install same product as from the store
4,Perfect!,"The best way to go about ordering this product is to find the exact one you need, then search for it. There are so many that pop up when you enter general info into the ""search"" bar. Glad I found it here."
1,Not as good as expected,I don't like it! It made the water taste metallic. I was using a generic filter before and there was no taste with the water. I had to switch back to the old one. I would not buy this again. This is not the fault of the seller just the product itself.
5,Best product ever,Best thing I've ever done was to sign up for auto ship on this product. Very good price compared to store prices.
1,get a better filter,I installed this filter and have all kinds of sediment coming out of my fridge faucet. Looks like calcium deposits. Highly noticable when you boil water. I use one of those pitcher that filter water an it works great.
1,Not what I ordered,Between the time I selected the item and click ordered - it changed to a different number then the one I wanted.
1,Water filter,"It doesn't seem to be filtering, were not getting the good tasting water that normally comes through the filters, are these defective, can I exchange them?"
3,Product is NOT what is pictured,"I ordered this product believing it was the actual Whirlpool/KitchenAid replacement filter as shown in the product image. Not so! This was a ""PUR"" branded replacement part as received. I ordered the twin pack. Fits fine in my appliance, but I'm not thrilled that the product is portrayed as the manufacturer's replacement product."
2,Not OEM Quality,"The filter that arrived was not fabricated by the company that makes the OEM Filters for Whirlpool - this filter is a aftermarket replacement. The o rings that are part of the filter are smaller than the o rings that are on the OEM. Not an issue for water quality but could be a problem during installation - they provide a lubricant for the seals so to reduce the chance for the o rings to foul during installation. The water tastes fine, but the ice cubes produced are cloudy. Before the new filter was installed, the ice cubes were more translucent with the old filter. I will go with the OEM filter listed on Amazon next time and save about $14 compared to Lowes."
1,Defective filter,"I usually buy my filters at my local hardware store and have always been happy with them.I decided to order one this time.I do not know what the difference is but I must have gotten a bad one.i have run about 10 gallons of water thru to try to get some kind of lint out of the filtered water.This is strange if I had not threw the box away I would return it,this one is defective."
5,"Good product, good price","I got the water filter as a replacement for my Whirlpool refrigerator. This was a good price, fast shipment and proper filter needed. Would recommend. Good buy!"
5,Does the same job as the original for a lot less $$$$,Why pay for an item at top dollar from it's retailer when you can get it for a heck of a lot less at Amazon. Also the seller kept me abreast of the shipping date etc. and followed up to see if I was happy with my purchase.
5,One half the price!,"I read all the reviews and decided to try this filter. It costs 1/2 of what I could buy it for at Sears. That is a huge savings, especially when your on a fixed income. I am very happy with this filter. I have not noticed any difference and it fits in my Kenmore side by side without any problems. I will be purchasing this again. How can you go wrong, great price, FREE shipping, and it's delivered to my front door. Thanks Amazon, I love shopping here, I have saved so much $$."
4,Lasted about a year,Whirlpool 4396508P Filter was installed in a KitchenAid 25 cubic foot refrigerator. Filtered water was equal to bottled water in clarity and taste. I've used them for several years and each one lasts about a year. Very satisfied.
4,Does the job,"This is the filter needed for my Whirlpool refrigerator. The previous one I had produced water that was odd tasting. This one is much better although not as good as my old reverse osmosis system.The unit is not difficult to install although I do not like crouching down and installing the unit. I think the filters that are actually inside the refrigerator are more convenient, but they take up valuable internal space and do not last as long.Under typical usage the units should last about 6 months."
4,"Book in great condition, not sure this version is an improvement over the original","This book looks great and I love the series. I'm not sure it's an improvement over the original, however. Busier, but main ideas and supporting details not as clearly presented, I think."
1,never forget to write a description,"I was interested in this product until I saw there was no description for the item such as age , condition, model # accessories included or not included, software etc.without a descritption there is little interest in this item."
1,Feels like a piece of wood,Item is really bad quality. It is hard and does not expand at all. The internal surface is very rough and irritates skin easily.I had to through it out after the first use.Stay away.
1,Stay away from this company,Items are awful used and quality very badcompany not responsible for returneven product is broken.Don't recommended stay away.
3,Not my favorite,"I wanted a wooden cutting board because of all the bacteria that plastic ones can harbor. But even after rubbing mineral oil on it, it's very dry and there are no rubber grips on it so it slides all over the counter. I'm going back to plastic!"
5,wonderful mixer,"This is the best mixer! I love the bowl lift and the color perfectly matches my kitchen ( I have the orange, I think it's called tangerine). Everyone that comes to my house coments on the mixer. I love ot bake and this makes it 10 times more enjoyable. And the price? The best I have ever found!"
5,love it but it is big,I have owned this mixer for a few months.It is my first stand mixer and I dont know how I ever did without one. I am glad I bought the higher powered-larger bowl model. The only problem I have experienced is I cant put it on my counter because it is too tall to fit under the cabinets. I also wish it had a tilt head but I wanted the extra power and the all metal gears so giving that up seemed and still seems small. I would recomend this mixer.
3,Broken mixer--good warranty,"Our mixer arrived and it looked great, but it did not work. No matter what setting we put it on, it ran at the highest setting and then cut out after about 10 seconds. The good news is this: We called KitchenAid and they corrected it immediately. They sent us a brand new mixer (and an upgrade at that) within a week and provided shipping and pick-up to send the defective mixer to them. The new mixer is GREAT! We just made a batch of bagels, with no strain on the mixer at all. Kudos to KitchenAid!"
1,Question,"Is this refurbished mixer? I noticed the warranty is only for 90 days and, according to the Kitchen Aid website, a brand new mixer comes with a 1 year warranty. The item description doesn't mention anything about the product being refurbished or reconditioned. Does anyone know?"
1,Power Burn Out,"I always thought the name ""Kitchen Aid"" was a great product line until I owned this mixer as well as the ""Kitchen Aid"" blender. The mixer does look very nice and worked ok but for less then a year and then the motor burned out - this also happend to the blender. Now I understand why there are some many factory ""Kitchen Aid"" refurbished mixers and blenders - the product does not last very long and the warrenty is only for one year, it seems to expire right after the motor burns out. I for one will not waste my money on ""Kitchen Aid"" products again."
1,Underpowered Look a Like,Don't mistake this for a professional series mixer (better built & 575 watt motor). This model is for light duty only - 6 qt. bowl is much to large for the available power. I own the pro model and have also used this model - save your money & buy the pro.
4,KitchenAid Mixer,"This product meets any expectations I had for a stand mixer. Previously I was using a hand mixer for nearly all needs, and have found the Kitchenaid to make the task so much easier. Hands free operation is wonderful. Clean up is easy, and it has enough power to mix a large batch of cookie dough!"
3,book for someone already familiar with hindi,"This book is very good for someone who is familiar with hindi, like who could read and understand a few simple words. I enjoyed reading this book since I consider my self belong to that category. I'm not sure howmuch someone, who is not exposed to hindi atall, will benefit from this book.Exercises and vocabulary sections are very good, as the title of the book says, the book focuses on the grammar part of the spoken and written hindi not for beginners who just want to learn to speak."
5,Brujeria,This album has no other explanation other than it is one of the best albums they have put out. And yes I am a gringo and I will continuosly listen to them as long as the keep it coming.
5,Just what I ordered!,"500ml of Purigen is what I ordered. And I received 500ml of Purigen. It's a good product. I'm still waiting on my new filter to get here to use it, but many people I know use it with great success. Make sure you get ""The Bag"" From Seachem as well! It's a 180 Micron Bag designed to hold Purigen, you -WILL- Need it."
5,Removes color from the water,"I use this to remove tannis from the water of my freshwater tanks that have driftwood. No matter how many times you boil driftwood before you put it in the tank, you can never get all the color out. Purigen takes it out of the fishwater. I prefer not to regenerate the Purigen as I have followed the directions carefully but somehow get a little trace of chlorine that puts my fish over the edge - it's happen to me multiple times. Instead I buy Purigen in bulk and just empty out the bags and refill and tie off with a plastic tie. Also gets color out of tank water that has dirt as a substrate - yes, dirt will color your water especially in a nano tank. Love Purigen. Just wished it didn't cost so much."
5,I'm impressed.,"I have to admit I've seen a huge difference in my water quality and clarity after using Purigen. Nitrates have lowered, holding steady at < 20 ppm. I could never get them this low unless I did partial water changes every week which was getting old. The clarity of the water has, as expected, made my tank look more vibrant and fresh.Pros: Water ClarityReduction in NitratesLess water changes.Last a long time and its ""rechargeable.""Cons: You have to use a very fine meshed media bag. Which was very difficult for me to find in the large dimensions I needed. But that's more my problems than the product's."
2,NOT silicone,"This product was described as silicone coated on some websites and as Teflon coated on others, so I contacted Kitchen Supply to find out what materials it's actually made of. The response I received was:""The Super Parchment is a Teflon-coated nylon fiber. It does not contain any silicone.""The description on Amazon is incorrect. I haven't used this parchment paper, so I can't evaluate how well it works. But as I was intending to buy a silicone liner and an uncoated baking sheet as part of an effort to phase out the fast-dying Teflon cookware from my kitchen, this doesn't exactly serve my purpose, and I will be returning it."
1,Didn't last long,"I bought this based on good reviews, but after about 6 months, I noticed it had holes in it. First I assumed my kids used it as a cutting board, but after closer inspection, they were tears, not cuts. I definitely wouldn't buy it again. I'll stick with my paper parchment paper."
5,Fabulous Fairy Book,"I was excited to find the book and even more pleased when I recieved it. It was a gift and the recipient also loved the book. I collect fairies, so it was very a very appropriate gift for my expecting niece.I am very pleased"
5,Lovely book,I bought this baby book for my angel and I fell in love with it. It is very beautifully done on outside & inside. Does not have too much details but covers all the milestones of the first year. Highly recommended!!!
4,Very cute for a girl.,"I love fairies and when I saw this book and found out I was having a daughter, I had to get it. It even had a satin ribbon to close it. I like it because the pages are very basic and easy to fill out and have room for you to place pictures, write, whatever you want! I love looking at my baby book and I imagine my daughter enjoying the fairies and her cute pictures when she is older."
5,Great product,"This is a great product, very reliable and easy to program. I like it so much I ordered a second one for the back yard. The only change I'd like to see would be an easy way to suspend the watering cycle without having to reprogram it, but that's not a big deal.Oh, and an earlier reviewer is mistaken about the manual function (which is very convenient). When you turn it on manually it times out in 30 minutes, regardless of what cycle time you've programmed into it."
4,half year no problems,"Really too soon to say but I like this timer.I've had only two other water timers before this one and they were touchpad programmable Nelson Rain Date / Better Home & Gardens (same type) with separatable programmer/valve, both which eventually broke down due to water intrusion. Although, those lasted much longer than the relatively short time I've had this Melnor.I'm hoping for better longevity since it seems built very well for being plastic. Only time will tell.The evenly spaced 6 cycles (every four hours) works well for the landscape waterfall/birdbath combo I made. No low battery trouble (yet) after those past six months (now stored away for winter)."
3,Battery doesn't last,The product works great for two o three weeks but after that you get the low battery sign and stops working. I was watering just once a day for a 10 minutes period.
1,Good example of where theory becomes limited by phenomenology...,"This book tends to be incredibly essentialist, overly generalizes and homogenizes all trans* people, focuses too much on transsexualism that's essentialist, reiterates the rhetoric of how transsexualism isn't a viable gender identity/presentation, and uses ciscentric, cissexist and transphobic language. Not terrible, but be aware of what you're reading."
2,Waste of time,"I bought this book after seeing Brain Jenkins in one of his many television interviews. I usually like what he has to say, and this book was cited on the program.The book has very little new information in it. Jenkins just rehashes the obvious throughout. I suppose someone that lived under a rock for the past 20 years might find Will_Terrorists_Go_Nuclear? interesting.Jenkins doubts there is a immediate threat of a hidden nuclear device in the US. They are too hard to make, too hard to maintain, too hard to make small and maintain. The nuclear threat from terrorists is just rhetoric, causing a pervasive, underlining panic in every American's life. That's about it for the book. It's a tedious read.He does discuss red mercury, which is why I didn't give it one star."
4,Tom Noble - Tom Noble,"Tom Noble presents broken beat with a definite jazz flair -- and some hints of romanticism as well, with the opening track, ""Moon and Stars,"" encapsulating this perfectly. The dub inflections of ""Just Another Daydream"" offer a counterpoint to the jazz elsewhere. And although ""Ya Ya Dub"" is a tad featureless, ""Two Sugars"" redeems his dub standing). Nina Miranda offers her beautiful voice to the broken-Brazillian of ""Keep It Slow,"" and Tom contributes his own vocals to the delicate fiesta of ""You Are."" Elsewhere, Anthony Elvin delivers some soul with ""Kind in the Night."" But there are surprises, as well, like the Indian-infused funk of ""Bollyweird"" and dub of ""Raaj Dub"" or the samba throb of ""In My Mind."" A nice international-leaning collection."
4,Good for starting out,"This book has excellent tutorials, but hardcore programmers looking for more of a reference type book are best off skipping right to Paul Catanese's ""Director's Third Dimension""."
5,Phantasm T Shirt,Everything I had hoped and dreamed it would be. All my wildest dreams have come true.
3,Not for big heads,What the makers forgot is that people like me with XXL heads need longer chin straps than most folks! It's an annoying fiddle to get the chin strap fastened. All I need is 1 inch more strap length!
2,like many others...what happened?,"what happened to the awesome band that released ""when breath escapes"" or ""wolves in sheeps clothing""? i heard the new song on myspace which didn't appeal to me. i figured since it was on sale for 10 bucks, i would go get it just to see if any other songs were like that. the things that pisses me off the most about this cd is the fact that the riffs are all nu-metal. nothing complicated. and what the hell is going on with the danzig style vocals? what was CJ thinking when they were recording this cd? i gave it 2 stars just because Hell Blaze is an awesome song with a killer breakdown and no 80's singing. take the advice of me and many others. if you liked ""when breath escapes""... DO NOT GET THIS CD!!!"
1,Worst CD I've purchased in the past 2 years,"Man, this really disappointed me. After seeing a commercial advertising Sinai Beach's ""immersed"" I was ready and willing to purchase the album, expecting a blend of epic and technical hardcore metal. Unfortunately, I was left with nothing more than a bland metalcore band. And the singing in the chorus'! It's off key and off beat, and sounds completely awful! The other instruments are nothing new, just bland riffs and drop-d power chords. The vocals in the song verses aren't anything exciting either. Just monotone screaming, reminiscent of Hatebreed.Needless to say, I'm pissed off. The commercial really led me to believe that this band had something special. How wrong I was. Avoid this at all costs."
2,What Was Victory Records Thinking?,"Review by Mike Watson:What do you call an album that starts off incredibly promising then quickly wipes the smile of your face and disappoints you to the point of almost disgust and headache? To answer that question, simply pick up Sinai Beach's new album, Immersed. The entire album sounds like cheap nu-metal with someone who wants so desperately to be hardcore's Glen Danzig. The problem is, it's a poor impersonation, because NO ONE can compare to Danzig. The best thing I can compare this album to is Fear Factory with the same breakdown spliced in and awful power metal vocals. If that's your thing give this album a chance."
4,Not half bad.,"This is what I like to call brutal metalcore. I'm not talking about the brutality of death, black,or thrash metal or grindcore, but brutal hardcore. This is simply hardcore downtuned to metal with some thrash elements mixed in it. Of course the lyrics are pretty brutal, too and if you can't tell that these guys are Christians, then you need your eyes examined or something. Also like the use of some of the electronica/dance (yes! it is on a metal cd!) they use on songs 1, 5, and 9; don't worry though, it sounds nothing like the junk linkin park puts out. I also love the sick album art throuhgout the cd book and cover. Sick stuff all round if you don't mind some basic metalcore (plus electronica) and want to listen to a band that doesn't ripoff those all those melodic metalcore posers (not all of them: killswitch engage, unearth, the showdown are all sick bands)."
2,What happened to this amazing band?,"This album is a sore disappointment after listening to ""When Breath Escapes"" which I recommend over this. I loved that CD so much and was glad when they signed to Victory but then upon hearing this my first thoughts were ""what happened?""I may give this album to a friend of mine or simply sell it. I miss the subtleness of the message. This slaps you acrossed the face a little too hard. Also I really miss the clean vocals on the first album."
3,Sinai Beach,"This album gets pretty good at Track 4. The Punishing, catchy riffs start at that point. It is just another metalcore album with strange vocals that you have to get used to. The refrains aren't catchy enough for some, but it avoids the annoying repetition of modern pop-rock."
2,Cheap in price and quality.,"I wouldn't recommend this. There are better (informative and visually) on the market, albiet a tad more expensive. Those interested in these varients want a book not a pamphlette."
4,Shape and Colour Sorter,"I bought the coloured shapesLauri Toys Shape and Color Sorterfor my 1.8 years old grandson. I wanted him to have hands-on experience on shapes and colours that he already learnt from the pictures. The game is just right for his level - not too hard and not too simple. Obviously he has a way to go -he is not yet correctly sorting, mixing colours and shapes, but obviously enjoying the play and getting better in days. Excellent instruction on extensions. And excellent toy - simple, clever and may be durable."
4,Educational but flimsy,I bought this after reading many reviews... and I'm glad I bought them for my 11 month old - but my husband will be making a sturdy fixed base for the shapes. As other reviewers noted - the pegs come out way too easily for a not-so-coordinated little one. He just tears everything apart and can't even try to put the shapes on the pegs without them popping off. Overall i do like the shape/color combination though.
4,Great fun for a 2 year old,"We have other Lauri toys which are great, and this one is no exception. My daughter enjoys playing with the pegs, and sorting and resorting the shapes. Perfect size for a 2 year old--not too large or small. One negative of this toy, in my opinion, is the wooden pegs. We have another set with plastic pegs, where the pegs stack, and I was hoping the 2 sets could be used together. Not the case, since there isn't a space for the wooden pegs to stack like their plastic counterparts. A small complaint, and I'd still highly recommend this toy."
1,"Hazardous! Great toy, but doesn't stand up to being chewed","The package did not mention that it was a choking hazard for children under 3!!! I plan to complain to the manufacturer. Its definitely a hazard if your child is still teething -- my 19 mo son who still likes to chew up stuff decimated a piece. I luckily fished out the red star in four pieces from his mouth before he could swallow and get into any trouble.So while I no longer give the toy to him, I plan to once he is over the chewing stage since he loved fitting the pegs back, and stacking and sorting and it definitely kept him educationally engaged. 3 stars on the durability since while he can chew it up, its an engaging toy, and my friends 3 yr olds enjoy the toy too. Also, Lauri replaces pieces for [a nominal fee.]"
4,Functional but not fun for all,"I use this item for doing developmental evaluations of children up to 3 years old. It is very useful for that purpose but I find that only about 25% of the kids are interestesd in it. The ones who like it seem to like it a lot but the high energy kids don't really like it much. Maybe it would ""grow"" on a kid if they had it in their home but in general I'd only recommend it to families whose kids like fine motor tasks like puzzles, shape sorters, etc."
3,Disappointing,"I'm sure that this toy would be very educational and probably would be for a lot of toddlers, but not my 2-year-ols grandson. Actually using it is a challenge since the pegs pull out so easily he doesn't use it in the way it is intended. Instead of putting the shapes on and taking them off, he pulls out the whole peg, shapes and all, defeating the whole purpose of the toy. To salvage this, I tried using a good glue product but that didn't work. Plan B is to try a glue gun and see how that works out. Plan C is to buy him one in which the pegs do not come out. Didn't want to have to do that but I think that's what's coming. I'll let you know...03/07/12Well, I got out my handy glue gun and went to work. This time it took him a little longer to pull out the pegs, but out they came!! This is fine if your child likes to put the pegs back in, but for my grandson, it's a no go. I'll be buying another product. Sigh."
5,Black Bomber!,"I have a 2011 Allez double. It is black and had white grips - I wanted to black it out, and have the luxury/class of leather grips. These things are awesome. The only thing is that they are a little slick - which I'm sure oiling or treatment would remedy. They're gonna last forever and age with grace! They are NOT as padded as foam grips - but I kinda like the feel of the road a little more. My chromo bike absorbs shock well enough - doesn't bother me that much. Love them."
2,Not Impressed,"Decided to spring for this with high hopes due to many good reviews, but will be sending it back. Right out of the package I was not impressed with the feel of the leather. It is very thin leather, with a texture that says to me it will probably break down quicker than I'd like it too. The color is awful funky too (I got antique brown)...just a dead matte brown color...does not look like the saddle's finishing at all. Also, Brooks makes a big deal about their stuff still being made in England, so I was pretty disappointed to find that this was made in China. Overpriced for all these flaws, in my opinion. I hear good things about the Velo Orange leather tape, but I think I'll be doing cloth/shellac on this bike."
2,Overrated,"I purchased the bar tape in ""Honey"" and here are a few issues:1. It doesn't match the ""Honey"" saddle2. The leather is really thin3. Develops a lasting odor from sweatIf you sweat a lot this tape isn't for you. After a few rides my tape developed an odor from my consistent sweating. The odor was so bad that my wife complained that it was starting to take over the room that I kept my bike in, and she was right. This tape takes a long time to dry if it gets wet from rain/sweat. Go with something cheaper."
2,Tapers cut wrong?,"I don't know if I got a bad box, but the tapered ends on both rolls of tape I got were cut the same direction. Typically you wrap one bar clockwise, and the other counter-clockwise. I didn't realize that the second roll was cut wrong until I had finished the first bar. I had to recut the tapers and waste about 4-6 inches. The tape came up shorter on the bars than I would have liked it as a result.But aside from that.It takes some patience to wrap, since the leather is quite tough, but it does stretch when you put a little muscle into it. The antique brown color was alarmingly light when I first got it, but once the tape was on I applied a tiny bit of proofide and it darkened to match my saddle perfectly. Not very much padding at all, which can be good or bad depending on your preference.If not for the taper issue I would've given it four stars. I hope every box doesn't come like that."
1,Don't get it wet,"Bought this tape to match my black Brooks B17 saddle. First off, it's not a very good match. Second, it lasted all of about 3 days. I got this in black and I got caught in a rainstorm shortly after this tape was installed. When wet, the black dye from the tape bled all over my hands, the ground, my bike, and whatever else my hands came in contact with. It was a huge mess. The dye ruined everything it contacted. To make matters worse, after all of this I was left with an ugly dark green looking handlebar tape. Immediately threw in the trash and went back to my $20 tape.I know you are supposed to prevent Brooks saddles from getting wet but how can they release a handlebar tape and expect it to be covered from the elements?This is overprice garbage. Brooks should stick to making saddles. This was a total waste of money."
4,It's Brooks,"I used this tape to wrap the top bar on my bike after it took a nasty spill and got rather dented/scratched.I got the antique brown to match my Brook's saddle and handlebar grips of the same color. It's worth noting that it isn't exactly the same color. The tape is a bit of a flatter and lighter brown while the saddle is more of a dark and almost deep red brown.However, I have noticed that as the tape accumulates oil and wear from use it is becoming darker and gaining a bit of character. So I wouldn't be surprised if it looks much closer to Brooks' usual antique brown after another few months.Overall very happy with the quality. It is Brooks, after all."
5,Park PCS-11,"Great repair stand. The clamp is easy to use and is very strong and it has rubber padding to protect the bike frame and the cables. I researched other repair stands and I think its worth spending a little more for the PCS-11 that has a clamp that secures and tightens quickly and easily. It is very easy to rotate the bike to whatever angle needed. It folds up for easy storage but it takes up a lot of room when its not folded up. Very stable and secure, no worries of the stand and bike tipping over. It is silver which is a big visual improvement over that awful blue color of other park stands and tools."
5,Best for C-Programming,"I've read through a few C-Programming books, and this is the best I've found yet. Comprehensive, compact, and teaches the language very well.Highly recommended reading for novices, and a great reference for all."
4,Typo-ridden code but still good,"Well-structured learning path and text organization. It feels like sidenotes and whatnot are included in all the right spots. The author tries to use humor fairly often, really doesn't pull it off, but I'm glad he does because it makes the book easier and more comfortable to read; so I guess if he's going for dorky then he succeeds well. The only problem I have is in the example/explanation code relatively frequently containing errors, i.e. bad syntax, mismatches between what is read in the text and what the code shows, using incorrect/misspelled variables/numbers/specifiers/etc. In a way, I suppose it adds to the educational effect and gears you towards debugging, but it still irritates me to read. This is the first programming book I've read, so I can't make a concrete comparison, but the purpose of the book is to teach, and it accompishes that very well."
5,Great book on C!,Very indepth coverage and dare I say it explains concepts much better and clearer than the classical C book from Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ricthie!
5,"C for All, All for C!","I always thought I knew C, until I picked this book up. There were enough wow moments that I read the book thoroughly. Just to give an example, I never thought I would learn something about embed systems and ""unions."" Wether you are new to C or just want to refresh your knowledge, this is the right book for you.Unlike some other books, this is written in plain and clear English, and there are tons of examples available. You will find enough programming jargons, their definitions, and C language history in this book that you can speak confidently in a C conference! Maybe the last one was a little extreme, but it is somewhat true. This book gives you all you need to know about C minus the real-world personal experience.In its fifth edition, Stephen Prata has given the computer society an exceptional gift. If you just need to learn C, or you want to refresh your knowledge and see some new ways of doing your ordinary things, this is the best book you can find."
2,not the author's best,"Unlike some of Merline Lovelace's longer books, this story lacks interest. The premise--pilot frozen in the 1950s is thawed out now--seems to promise readers an interesting look at the hero's adjustment to modern values, but in fact he makes the adjustment fairly easily. His sexism, etc., is all on the surface. The heroine isn't terribly interesting either--she could pass for the heroine of several other romances without trouble. If you're going to start with a sci-fi premise, you should DO something with it--not hang the same old romance plot on it and expect it to be enough."
5,Great LCD for a GREAT price!,"My husband and I are VERY pleased with this Mitsubishi LCD1512. I did a LOT of research on these LCD monitors, and this one had the best contrast ratio (400:1) for the lowest price. (watch out for a ratio LOWER than 400:1--they are cheaper because the picture is horrible quality). We were very pleasantly suprised when it arrived--it has a beautiful picture and modern design and takes up so little space. It's VERY easy to use...just plug it in to the computer, and it's ready--no confusing set-up. Make sure to get a good 1-3 year warranty because all LCD monitors are prone to ""dead pixels"". Also, it does not come with speakers."
5,PERFECT!!!,"This light weight laminate was perfect for projects I did. It sealed the items totally, with little effort, and cuts cleanly."
4,Loved these,"The sheets worked really well, I used them for a photo book I made because I wasn't able to put through a heated laminating machine. They were really simple to use&was a lot quicker then I thought it would go"
2,Not nearly what I was expecting,"I so regret buying these laminating sheets! First off it says you get 50 sheets so I thought that meant it would be enough to laminate 50 sheets of paper front/back (Like most other laminating self adhesive products). But you get 50 ONE SIDED sheets - enough to cover 25 sheets front/back. The film is also thin and bends very easy and is not super clear. I guess I just got spoiled by Scotch's laminating sheets where one sheet covers the front/back of what you are laminating and is very thick, sturdy and clear. Will never buy this again!"
3,great product; misleading box,"The product works great and is easy to use.The box says ""50 pack"". This is 50 sheets, which means 25 laminates, assuming you are laminating both sides (like you really have a choice). Its very misleading and when I got my next-day shipment for an important meeting I had to get ready for at the last minute, I ended up with 20 fewer pages than I needed because of this package labeling. This is why I only gave 3 stars."
3,Thin,"From the rave reviews, I thought this was a heavier weight laminate. It's not. Super thin and doesn't seal all that well. For the money, it's not bad, but I wanted something with more weight."
2,Count your sheets!,"As far as the quality of this product goes, it is excellent, like most Avery products. It works as advertised, is easy to apply, and is far cheaper than a laminating machine.However, the box I ordered did not contain 50 sheets! Instead it had 49, and I was left unable to finish my project, which required all 50 sheets be used.Amazon replaced the box easily enough, but the second box also only contained 49 sheets. I decided to open a third box that I had ordered, and it contained only 48 sheets! This is terrible quality control.I called Avery and they are replacing the third box ""with a box that contains 50"" sheets, but I'll be sure to count that box when it arrives too."
3,Good but bad...,"This product was a good idea for me to waterproof documents for handling around a pool. But, the seal has failed every time since I have not been able to encase my document in the laminating sheets without having creases or bunching. Maybe I just don't have the technique down yet but a Ziplock bag fixed my problem without any of this hassle.If you don't mind wasting a few copies of your document and laminating sheets to practice getting a wrinkle free seal then this isn't a bad idea. Unless of course your a pro already!"
3,Crease mark on every sheet.,"These are nice. However, there are ""crease"" lines in each sheet. The backing has been cut about 1"" along the longest side to aide in removal of the paper backing. However, the cutting process leaves a crease mark on the clear plastic side.I was planning on using these to laminate photos, but the line shows up very vividly.For books and stuff, I guess this flaw is okay. But if you plan to seal photographs, this simply won't do."
3,Should have known,"I guess I should have known by the price but when I buy a new book, I expect a new book. The first non-amazon dealer sent me a filthy book, the second was at least clean and unworn but read in the packing slip notes it was from an estate sale. Shouldn't that be called like-new? New means from the book publisher, doesn't it? I can shop at half priced book stores and know what I am getting. I will be sticking with Amazon only sales going forward."
3,Patho workbook,Some chapters have a nice summary at the beginning that highlighs some of the main points. The quizzes are somewhat helpful but seem to broad for some chapters and too specific for others.
1,"Bad Cage! Bad, Bad Cage! (Scolding it)","This particular cage is an absolute pain in the diddily-butt to clean. Not to mention that the poor critters, when nervous, have no place to go except the small platform in the middle, and the rest of the cage moves when they do. It's also not cool if you've got more than one cage in use and little space to put them. It's big and awkward.Please note: I'm speaking from experience with a used, donated cage and using it with shelter pets, who are less sociable and more prone to be nervous b/c of their surroundings. So, I will admit that its entirely possible that I could be griping about it simply being old; however, since the plastic appeared to be gently used (meaning, no critter had time to scratch it/bite it much) I'm guessing it was donated to the shelter b/c the purchaser didn't like it either! This is cage of extreme last resort for us; it doesn't come out unless we absolutely need it."
4,Exercise Room only,"I don't recommend this as the only house for your rodents. But I do recommend it as a habit trail / exercise wheel.My gerbils had most of the second floor chewed out, I ended up ripping the middle part out.Also I had to tape the bottom door shut as they chewed their way out of it.I don't think its noisey like the first review states. It makes an excellent running area for my gerbils (who have almost every piece of the crittertrail collection). I like that its has pleanty of space to run around esspecially after removing the second floor. My gerbils do not care for the small habit trails in their cages and in some cases have become nothing more than a storage area for wood for chewing.I give it a 4. Works great as a exercise room, but its sucks as a home."
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK,"Save yourself and don't buy this thing. Its too hard to keep clean and its extremely noisy. It doesn't have very good stability. It takes forever to clean and I actually have to take a tooth brush to get into the little nooks and crannys. It was way overpriced for all the headaches it causes. It has a very leaky water bottle, food dish is always thrown around and the hamster hates the wheel It caught one of his claws and ripped it off. Buy a Jackeroo. So much better."
4,"""Okay now here's the deal, Pep bust it...""","You HAVE to had grown up during the era of this album to TRULY appreciate it. I used to carry my radio around EVERYWHERE and play this TAPE, yes I said TAPE, ALL the time!! Salt n Pepa are true pioneers in the rap game that was, back then, dominated by men. With this being their sophomore album, it stil stands strong even today. Maybe it's just me being nostalgic and all, but I was feeling this album when it came out and if my tape hadn't worn out, I'd still be rockin' it today! So now I have to buy the CD..."
3,Nice Follow-Up.....But Could Have Been Better,"Salt N Pepa's sophomore album does not generate as much buzz as their sizzling debut. True, the tracks ""Shake Your Thing"" and ""Get Up Everybody"" made the Top 20, but the rest of the album is a flop, mainly because it lacks good lyrics and has poor producing status."
3,Not Cool or Hot,Salt N' Pepa's second album leaves a lot to be desired. The so-called hits on here do not measure up to the one from the first album or their later efforts.
4,Great so far,I just got the product in the mail today and it is look good I did some work with it and the router seems to perform well. I have bad comment and that is that the router bits are hard to get to and I wish they would have made it easier the lock down the chuck so I don't have pushing a button to change the bit
3,Funciona regularmente,"su desempeño no fue el esperado, sin embargo, se adapta a mis necesidades pues la carpinteria es mi hobby y no a lo que me dedico."
4,The Boss Is On Fire,"This second cd from the gangstress of rap really showed some growth and maturity from her first release ""Who's The Boss"".This MC has been praised as the female Rakim and she more thanlives up to the hype. Not only does she shine vocally, but thealbum gives you a nice blend of hip-hop/r&b;/house/and new jackswing. She got help from Spinderella and Pepa of Salt N Pepa on the first single ""Never Get Enough"", she brings the message ofself worth to the fore on the new jack anthem ""I wanna Be Me"",and if you need some motivation via a hip hop track then theMantronik produced ""Take It From The Top"" will do justice.Another highlight of the cd is the medley ""Who Gives The Orders/If the price is right"" The first being a diss to her then opponent on the mic, (MC LYTE), while the later is an infectiousgroove lifted from Sade's ""Paradise"" that has a positive vibe andrhymes cooler than an evening breeze in indian summer. Definately a good purchase for old school hip hop lovers."
2,Another money grab... skip at all costs!,"As if volume 1 containing four episodes wasn't a big enough insult to fans, now comes vol. 2 with only four more episodes. These episodes aren't even in anamorphic widescreen! Do not waste your money on this release; wait for the full season 1 box set which will probably be out for the holiday season this year."
1,DON'T Buy this. Go HERE instead:,"I made the terrible mistake of buying ""A Galaxy Divided"", the first disc released for ""The Clone War"" TV series. The description did not tell you that it contained ONLY FOUR episodes and not the full season; I thought it was the entire first season. Don't make the same mistake I did; don't buy either ""A Galaxy Divided"" or this disc. They never should have been released. Wait and purchase (or pre-order) the complete season instead at:DVD:http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002L3RVCY/ref=pe_5150_12975230_snp_exploreBlu-ray:http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PO53IO/ref=pe_5150_12975230_snp_explore"
4,"Wonderful period piece, book of ideas","I'm getting ready for a trip this summer to Nova Scotia and love to read books about places I'm visiting. This is a wonderful romance, but deeply embedded in the social history of Halifax during World War I. We see the toll the war takes, how patriotism is used and misued, and the class tensions between Catholics and Church of Englanders. Canadians are striving for their own kind of recognition from England, by sending huge numbers of men to the front, to carry out the most dangerous missions in a war that over time became meaningless. An engaging read."
5,A book of great caliber!,"I have always been a fan of Verne. His scientific knowledge is presented in such a way that, if you don't know what he is talking about, he will explain it to you, and if you still don't get it, you will at least be convinced that what he is saying is truth. I loved this book and could not put it down. It almost remindes me of David Bowie singing ""Space Oddity"". The sequal to the book is likewise similar to Peter Shillings answer song, ""Major Tom"". This is a great book, and will be loved by any Verne fan, or a fan of the ""Steampunk"" genere."
2,Free SF Reader,"Unfortunately, From the Earth to the Moon always struck me as being on the rather dull side, so it took me a while to get through it the first time I read it. I can't really recommend this to many, except perhaps those interested in the history of science fiction, or really big Verne fans. The story of the first trip to Earth's satellite."
2,What Happened?,I don't know what happened when this book was being printed but it was filled with so many typing errors that there were points when there were just scrambled letters and numbers I'm guessing were supposed to be words and sentences. I could only take this through to the first chapter before I moved on to another of Vernes works.
4,Intermediate Readers will Enjoy,"Who is Stealing the Twelve Days of Christmas is a good story for readers comfortable with chapter books. Alex and Yasmeen live on Chickadee Court. Each Christmas, the neighbors decorate their yards with a Twelve Days of Christmas display. This year, someone is stealing the displays and returning them a few days later. Alex's mother is a police investigator trying to solve a set of robberies of collectible mouse figures. Alex and Yasmeen piece together clues from their neighborhood crime and end up helping Alex's mom with the other robberies. The reader learns to be more objective. Look at the facts. Use logic. The reader also learns not to make a judgment based on a person's appearance. A person isn't 'bad' just because they are different."
1,Useless Resources - Waste Money and Time,"All the sources show in this book are easily found in website and those sources are not really will help you maximize your profit because most of the sources you need to pay monthly fees. Better think twice when you purchase this book, I already waste my time and money to own this book. Good luck on you"
4,Onion Girl Review,"This story follows the life of a very talented painter, Jilly Coppercorn who also has a special ability to dream herself over into a magic world. Jilly gets this ability after getting runover by a hit and run driver. During her stay at the hospital Jilly visits the dream world frequently. While in the dream world Jilly meets a lot of interesting people and creatures. I really enjoyed this novel. I ecspecially enjoyed how the story has a fairy tale like story line"
2,More a tract than a novel,"In this, Lint is providing more a tract on the consequences of childhood sexual abuse than a novel. This is in accordance with his other recent writings, which continue to use the spirit-world characters he developed in his early books, but far less imaginatively."
4,Goth Newford,"While not my favorite of Charles deLint's books, I enjoyed this very much. I especially liked the relationship between the sisters, as it parallels the troubles that my sister and I have gone through... be advised that this is one of deLint's darkest books and is probably not the one with which to start if you haven't read deLint before.... he remains one of my absolute favorite writers."
1,Let's not beat around the bush...,"this is simply one of the worst books I've ever read. Although I have heard of De Lint, I've never read any of his books before now, and I definitely won't be reading any more. A mind-numbing mish-mash of formulaic bad guys (bad girls, in this case) and equally formulaic righteous good guys (mostly very nice, sweet young girls, in this case, with a few sensitive new-age guy hangers-on). Evil twins, sin and salvation, death and resurrection, the spirit creators of the Earth and the limitless forest at the edge of our dreams, all get dragged through the mud by a bunch of characters that were apparently inspired by the cast of Felicity (or maybe Dawson's Creek). If you are interested in this ""urban fantasy"" thing, please, do yourself a favor and read something by John Crowley, whose pencil shavings are probably more interesting than this sad, sad book."
4,De Lint's Onion Girl,"In the Onion Girl, De Lint fans will find his usual superb writing and his interesting take on mythologies and urban fantasies; however, as a De Lint fan, be prepared to have the veil removed regarding the always cheerful, favorite character, Jilly.New readers for De Lint are better off starting with books like Moonheart or The Little Country--they are a little more lighthearted and more descriptive of both De Lint's urban Newford and his spirit world. The Onion Girl is darker and relies more on past Newford characters and their experiences 'crossing over' into fantasy as well as their experiences with the spirits in our world.As a longtime De Lint fan, this book is as enjoyable as always."
2,a fantasy fan's opinion,De Lint has a wonderful imagination. He is a talented writer who carries you into another realm with his words. And makes you question your beliefs about dreams and fairies. But this book just does not hold my attention. He switches off characters in every chapter and it takes almost halfway through the book before they all come together and even then it isn't interesting enough to read in a week. I am an avid reader and when I have a good book I finish it fast. I got this months ago and I still haven't finished it and have moved on to other books. Not worth buying. Borrow it if you insist.
2,Needs a good editor.,"The subject and characters were too raw for children and the writing too immature and preachy for adults. Graphic violence and rape of children by an abusive brother is the backstory for the lives of young adults who can move between the ""world as it is"" and a parallel universe of magic. The author's deft style and imagination lost out to the lengthy passages that highlighted the inner goodness of a character. These were trite and boring and slowed the progress of the story so much that I just skipped over them each time. This book was the first by this author for me and I am unlikely to read any others in the series. He needs a good editor."
1,My first and last De Lint book,"What dreadful writing. What wooden characters. I found myself losing track of who was whom, and worse yet, not caring about any of the characters. It was painful to read the ""Raylene"" chapters written in the lugubrious ""white trash"" dialect. I started skipping over as much as I could so I did not have to focus on the falseness of the prose.Recently I re-read Terri Windling's Woodwife, and Mr. de Lint's work came up as an Amazon recommendation. There is absolutely no comparison. This book is a lot of badly written codswallop."
2,Many factual errors,"I really wanted to like this book. A kind of ""Keep watching the skies"" for Horror movies of the 1970s...hey must be great, right?Well...no. I could forgive the author for his sometimes peculiar opinions, I could also forgive that some important movies only get a short paragraph dedicated to them.What I can't forgive is the unbelievable amount of factual errors in this book.No, SHOCK WAVES is NOT a 1970 release, it's from 1977. (Didn't the author look at Peter Cushing's FACE when he was watching the movie?)No, NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE does NOT take place in Dresden. Dresden is a landlocked city! How could the vampire SAIL from Transsylaynia to Dresden? The movie takes place in Wismar at the Baltic Sea.Probably I could go on and on but so far I checked only a couple of reviews.I can't give much credibility to a reviewer's opinion if the guy so obviously doesn't know what he's talking about."
4,Reflections of Horror films in the Disco Decade,I found I prefered John Kenneth Muir's Horror Films of the 1980s but this volume is essential if you liked the previous book or are a fan of Muir's excellent reviews.
4,Exciting and informative fast-paced book,"If you are interested in covert intelligence organizations or just like plain spy books, this is it. Gordon Thomas does thorough research and writes in an objective style yet still manages to tell the story of the Mossad with the page-turning excitement of a novel. So I'll keep this short because time is valuable. Needless to say, I strongly recommend this book."
2,Gideon's Spies-I've read better,"Gideon's Spies, while not as well written as By Way of Deception, still reveals Mossad's ruthlessness. Gordan Thomas seems to derive a sick pleasure in describing assassinations, deceit, espionage and taking advantage of the US that characterize Israel's secret intelligence agency. The author is in awe of this corrupt organization. If you can get past that, the events seem factual and are corroborated with other publications.By Way of Deception is a far better book. It has many more organizational details and each horrible incident unfolds like plot of a good mystery novel. The author, Victor Ostrovsky, is a Jew who had high expectations of a moral code of the Jewish state, who was bitterly disappointed upon entering the secret world of Israeli intelligence."
3,Simplistic and Sensationalistic,"The book survives on its fascinating anecdotes. Unfortunately, it leaves the reader with the inescapable impression that the stories are incomplete and too simplistic, and that the events are presented for purposes of sensationalism more than accuracy. One has no idea to what extent the stories are true, but more importantly, the author doesn't make a serious attempt to inspire the reader's confidence."
3,Teller of Information,"I found this book to be lacking something that most readers of this subject look for. I've read books about the mossad and Israel before and this one is good, but not the greatest. The author is spontaneous with his literature. At times it was interesting and grabbing and i couldn't put the book down. But often I found myself in a factual slum, struggling to get through. If you've never read anything about the Mossad, this is a good place to start, otherwise I would look elsewhere."
4,Secret Agent Man,"One review on the back of the book states, in part, ""good enough to be a movie."" This is certainly true. Combining fact, speculation, and a healthy mix of narrative, Gordon Thomas makes GIDEON'S SPIES an excellent read. He painstakingly peels back layer after layer of the spy organization few have heard of and even fewer know anything about. It has a ground zero, you are there feel, that ""tells it like it is."" You'll be shocked by the shear audacity of some of Mossad's actions, and you'll read disbelievingly The Mossad's involvement in stories straight off the front page of the newspaper. While some of it does seem a little far out, Thomas keeps you interested. GIDEON'S SPIES will grab your attention from the first page and never let go."
2,It is really top secret?,"I put this book 2 star because I never put less than 2 stars in a book, that is because I wrote two books (I gave them to my friends, I didn't publish them) and I know what is to write a book.Gordon Thomas is trying to tell us the most top secrets of the Mossad, I don't know if the Mossad, same as the CIA, MI5 or MI6 will let him do that (because all of them are involved), but if you like spies stories, read ""Triple"" (Ken Follet) or ""The Fist of God"" (Frederick Forsyth), in these books are telling all the Mossad secrets (same as in this book) with more enthusiasm and before anyone says that ""is a secret, nobody will know it till you read this book."" So I really don't know how much of this book is secret and how much is public.The book at first is interesting and keep you reading, but when you get to ""the secret"" part that is in other books is really boring, maybe because I already know the story, but since the half of the book I just read it to finish it."
3,"Terrorists or not, depends who writes the book","this books in a way agrees to the assassination sanctioned by the regime of israel. when some counteracts, they are labeled a terrorists, to march in a sovereign state and execute someone in front of his children is heroism; for a child to through stones at a fully armed occupying force is considered terrorism. one thing though, the author is BIASED. Read it if you believe in state authorized terrorism."
5,Gripping! You will not want to put it down.,Good insight into the Israeli Mossad. Stories that are quick and to the point. Another GOOD JOB for Gordon Thomas.
2,"Its not fine, but is o.k","The book is another way of saying GOTCHA. Although the writer may be signified by creditability because of his (former) position, some facts simply are not true. As an expert in the field, i recomend you to read it...........if you have nothing else to do."
1,"Just the Facts, Ma'am","Gideon's Spies is packed full of exhilarating and outlandish tales of the Mossad's exploits. It is, however, notably short on accuracy and journalistic integrity. Some of its claims are obviously false and many others cannot be substantiated and hinge of the testimony of mysterious unidentified sources. The book reads like fiction and many of its stories likely are just that."
1,Cracking the nut?,"I really wanted to read something solid about Mossad, but I cannot believe how speculative and disjointed ""Gideon's Spies,"" the ""updated edition for 2012,"" turned out to be. Gordon Thomas had a tough nut to crack-- but that's no excuse for writing a nut-job book.Those who engage in the dark arts of intelligence gathering and political assassinations tend to keep their mouths shut; the blabbermouths tend to be unstable, unreliable narrators. Thomas presents as fact every stray rumor he heard from a blabbermouth.Story that goes nowhere: Princess Di in the tunnel. Story that is laughable: how Robert Maxwell really died."
1,Kindle eBook is the Older Edition,"As of 6/27/2010, the web site indicates the eBook is the 5th edition (April 2010). The actual downloaded Kindle Edition is the 4th edition, 2007. Needless to say, I had to request a refund on the purchase and am now waiting for the correct edition to be available."
2,Random bits of information,"This book reminds me of the ramblings of a conspiracy theorist. Mr Thomas has a terrible tendancy of starting stories showing operatives in the present (which is totally uninteresting) then flashing back to the past. Often the flashbacks never revert to the present, or have another flashback within a flashback.I am no expert on Israeli intelligence activities, but when an author falsly reports a simple fact ""Israel has developed its own over-the-horizon accuracy for three German-build nuclear-powered submarines it had bought"" (Germany doesn't have nuclear powered submarines, and Israel certainly doesn't have them) I begin to question his more controvertial theories and ""facts."""
1,Ramble on...,"While reading this book I found that I was rolling my eyes every page. The author rambles on relating tidbits of information that don't seem to fit together at all and are, at best, poorly organized with no discernable order (chronological, by topic, context, etc). I have no way of verifying the authenticity of most of the information (it is after all a book on secret intelligence), but I know that some of the stories are so inconsistent as to make all the information in the book suspect."
5,Great book that makes you want to keep reading!,"This book was very well written. It's not dry, but rather makes you feel like you are part of the story. Sometimes you forget that this is not a work of fiction! The author was able to talk to many director-generals and Mossad agents that he writes about, and it shows through his writing. The book starts at the creation of what is now Mossad and talks about many events through the hunt for Osama Bin Laden (but stops before his capture). The book includes a dictionary of intelligence agency names, names for particular jobs/departments within Mossad, and a list of the director-generals of Mossad in case you need it while reading, but the author frequently adds a small definition of terms not used very frequently within the text itself so that you don't *have* to flip back and forth."
3,"""Written as it was and as it is""...published in the news","Initially captivating and hard to put down, it then deteriorates after the first one or two hundreds pages.Disappointing to realize that ALL the book has appeared in one form or another in the news.There are numerous errors and plenty of wild guesses as well. Repetitive bloviating especially in the last third.Most annoying is the obsession with Princess Diana's death. What has that tragic event anything to do with the famous ""Institute"" ? Why so many pages about it ? In order to appeal to the British readers ?If you are not familiar with Israel in general or with the mythical Mossad and its prolific activities specifically - then YES - absolutely, you must read it and you'll most probably like it. But if you do know about Israel and a bit of the history, politics, wars, and espionage that is an integral part of the Israelis' lives - then you can skip it."
1,But is it accurate?,"Mr. Gordon makes many shocking claims in this book. The Mossad supposedly knew that a truck bomb was going to be used against the marines in Lebanon, but didn't tell them. The Israeli Prime Minister (Shamir) supposedly gave Pollard's spy material to the Russians because he hated America. The Mossad supposedly didn't lift a finger to save William Buckley, who was tortured and killed in Lebanon. The famous Mr. Maxwell, who looted his employee's pension funds, supposedly gave those funds to the Mossad. I admit, I don't want to believe this stuff, but if the evidence was better, I would swallow hard and believe it. Its not enough to rely on an occassional disaffected spy like Ostrovsky. Lots of allegations in this book could be true, but on the other hand, they could be false."
1,Too much space between the covers.,"I can only second the opinions of a couple of the other reviewers. This book is an utter waste of time. It merely serves to confuse a subject already shrouded in mystery.The book lacks footnotes. It is poorly organized. The disjointed storied are arranged neither chronologically nor thematically.If you are looking to learn more about Israel's intelligence community, a far better place to start would be ""Every Spy A Prince""."
5,this book is fantastic!!,This book is fantastic and makes the reader know all the truth and how is the israeli mossad works.
2,Written for the Tabloids,"The story line is fragmented...oh what am i saying,there is no story line. It appears that this book, is more of a collection of tabloid stories. The information sources do not appear credible. There is a tendency to blame this intelligence service for number of assassinations and military blunders, without justification. Poorly written,waste of paper"
1,Just gets silly,"At first I was very intrigued by the book. Although the author does not cite sources, I still found it entertaining and at least plausible. Then it just started to get plain silly. The final straws were when the author writes of an Israeli helicopter that uses ""silent mode"" to enter enemy territory. As a helicopter pilot, I can assure you that is laughable, and I could no longer take the book seriously after that. A few pages later he references Pope Air Force Base in Georgia. A simple internet search would show you that Pope Air Force Base is not located in Georgia, but North Carolina. These are just a few of the numerous silly and down right wrong ""facts"" in this book. Move on to something better."
3,just readable,"There is a great deal of very interesting material here but it is so poorly written it made me want to throw it away several times. Potentially great stories about fascinating people all get a hit-and-run treatment, like a Cliff Notes version of the REAL book that wasn't written. Also, having read a number of older books on the subject, there is a fair amount of 'direct borrowing' evident. For better reading, try finding an old copy of Eisenberg's ""The Mossad: Inside Stories."""
3,As flawed as the earlier editions,"This is a heavily embroidered mish mash of anecdotes, the majority told elsewhere with more style. Lots of fascinating and entertaining stuff, no question, but Gordon Thomas is a myth-maker, so accuracy takes a back seat to speculation and romanticized conspiracy theorizing at every turn. If the guy can't get something simple like Sayaret Matkal right (Sayanet Maktal?!), as one of numerous examples, he's also just plain careless. The update doesn't really add a whole lot of new information. I'd recommend The Volunteer by Michael Ross -- a Mossad officer talks about the real-life functioning and actions of ha'misrad in the 1990's and the relationship with our CIA -- along with The Mossad, and Israel's Secret Wars."
4,Superb Spy book!,"If you admire the secret forces of the world's governments, then you ought to read this book and you'll find a new admiration towards the Israelies.The book is a series of stories that act as well planned adventures and it tells you the way the Mossad operates. You do need a good amount of history knowledge to understand the book but all in all it is a greatly described spy book. Enjoy!!"
2,Gordon Thomas misses point,"Ok book, author forgets espionage is inherently a dirty business that capitalizes on human lying, deceit, weaknesses and fear. Author doesn't miss a chance to malign the Mossad while painting known terrorists and ""family men"" and men of cause in addition to their terrorist work. He paints the European, Russian and Asian intelligence agencies as caught in Israel's relentless assault against terrorists and missing a opportunity to list the successful relationship between the CIA & Mossad combating international terrorism and Communism."
5,Cheesecake made easy.,"Clever pan that once the cheesecake is made, unloosen the spring and ""voila"", your cheesecake is ready to serve.What an idea whose time has come.Hooray for Frieling!"
5,Springform Heaven,"Frieling makes an excellent product. The construction is solid and there is no leaking. Flat glass bottoms are perfect for serving and avoid the hassle of removing the cake from the bottom of the pan. This pan does not have handles, but I did not have any difficulties removing the pan from the oven. This pan is also less expensive (but same performance) than the same pan with handles."
1,"Good idea, poor quality","I think the glass bottom is a great idea, but the first time I used it, the caramel sauce I poured in quickly leaked through onto the countertop. I thought I had not put the bottom in evenly, but on closer inspection I found that the ring does not close tightly around the glass bottom; it is not even snug. This may be a manufacturing flaw in the pan I bought, since others have not reported the problem."
2,Drip drip drip... not what you want from a springform!,"I have used one of these for a long time-- I like the glass bottom, though it was never a particularly tight seal. After living for a while with a cheapo IKEA pan in my other kitchen (I commute 1100 miles and unfortunately have two of many things), I finally decided to ""spring"" for a nicer pan, so to speak. The first one arrived and was all scratched up, so I returned it and got a second one. Filled that one up with water, and indeed, drip drip drip drip. It's from where the collar joins, since indeed, the outer side of the ring has to be looser than the inner side. Batter won't drip through it or anything, but butter in a crust, or juice from baking fruit might. It's not actually worse than the cheaper pan, so I decided not to return yet another one. But I'm quite disappointed, since I was hoping that by shelling out the cash for a fancier pan, I might get a relatively drip-proof one..."
1,Dented when it arrived...twice,"I was eager to use the new pan for a Thanksgiving dessert. On the recommendation from Cook's Illustrated, I ordered one from Amazon. It arrived with a couple small dents around the bottom edge, which I was concerned would affect the pan's ability to seal.Amazon quickly sent me a replacement, which arrived with an even larger dent than on the first one I returned. I am getting a refund this time, and will buy this from a local retailer, where I can inspect it before I leave the store.To Amazon's credit, I've learned how easy it is to get replacements and refunds."
2,Frieling Glass Bottom Pan,"I bought this pan with high expectations. Handwashed it in warm water, baked one cake in it. The glass bottom was amazing. No fear of damaging the pan.Then I tryed to attach the glass bottom to the ring again after we were done with the cake and it would not attach. It kept missing the grove made for the glass. Then I noticed that the ring was not even on the bottom so the glass could not sit into the grove properlly. Not sure if that was the way it came or the pan ring metal is really cheap and once it was used in the oven, it kind of made it's own wobbly shape after it cooled without the glass. Could not use after that."
3,Glass bottom is a nice feature,"Glass bottom is a nice feature. I am surprised how durable the glass has been. Other than that, this is a good pan, but nothing fancy."
1,It Leaks,"It's a very nice pan, and I like the fact that it has a glass bottom. However, when I took it out of the box and put water in it to test the seal, it leaked very badly - like a waterfall. It appeared to have a few slight dents near the spring/catch. I suppose it will be OK to contain a cheesecake and crust with foil layered underneath, but for this price it should be perfect."
2,Interesting but flat,"This movie is extremely interesting for the fact that it shows the agenda of a news channel, and it makes you think of what kind of agenda is behind our news broadcasting. However the documentary itself is extremely flat. It does not explore its potential, and simply reports the situation. After a while it gets very repetitive."
4,An excellent look at Islamofascist propaganda,"This DVD looks at al-Manar, the TV channel run by Hezbollah and broadcast via satellite all over the world. The team which filmed the documentary did a pretty good job, including a clip of one Palestinian who said al-Manar did not speak for him: ""They say we're all ready to blow ourselves up. Well I'M not ready!"" And another clip of a broadcaster at the TV station being asked the question if it was fair to compare Israelis to the Nazis when the Nazis killed over 6 million Jews. ""IF that really happened."" The guy said under his breath. Then he did some song and dance thing about how the numbers were exagerrated and it was all Zionist propaganda anyway.Very eye-opening."
2,"Worked great for awhile, but didn't last.","My wife got this for me on sale. Loved the controls, which are simple and logical. Timer worked great for one season, but then started turning on at times not programmed and were erratic turning off, too. Tried changing the battery, but didn't help. Too bad. Seems sturdy and tight and well laid-out. But southern Texas climate mandates dependable watering or everything dies."
1,My Melnor unit just failed after 3 months.,"I came to Amazon to look for a replacement and happened upon this site, where I see that I'm not the only one that has had a problem.I shop on Amazon a lot, and I have never seen so many bad reviews for product failure.The money isn't worth it for me to pursue Melnor for a refund (which, on further consideration, may explain why it keeps selling a clearly defective product). But I guarantee you - I will NEVER buy anything from Melnor again."
1,Biggest piece of junk ever,"Very hard to program. Can't tell if it is on or off. After 3weeks noticed it wasn't workong. Battery was dead. Removed battery ( 9 volt) and terminals were full of corrosion. Unit had leaked water inside and completely corroded away one contact, making device useless. Thank God! Now I can buy a good one. Hated this thing from day one."
2,Leaked and U/I a challenge.,"Leaked, and user interface was a bit challenging. Returned and purchased competing product from Orbit--which doesn't leak and has a more intuitive U/I."
2,Not very watertight for a unit designed to be out in the weather,"I travel out of town often on work related business. I bought this item to run soaker hoses in my garden while I was out of town. During one trip, I had a multi-hose manifold break and send out a shower of water for several days. The Melnor timer got wet, and even though the battery compartment has a waterproof gasket and the unit looks to be weatherproof, the LCD screen fogged up and stopped working. This could just as easily have been a heavy rain that caused the problem. Beware if you buy this unit. Keep it sheltered from heavy downpours."
1,Shame on me,"This is my second Melnor 3015 that has failed in two years. The first worked for one season and the valve would not open. I liked the unit other than that and decided to purchase another one for the following season, because I came up with a plan to put it in storage after last season. At the end of last season I removed the unit opened the valve manually and flushed it with air from my air compressor. Then I gave it a few shots of LPS-1, while cycling it on and off between shots. Put it in a zippy bag and on a shelf till this spring. And I thought I was so cunning. Got It off the shelf 3 weeks ago, Put in a new battery and 'VIOLA' the valve was frozen again. For what I paid for this unit I expected it to operate for a couple season at least. Yes, I do feel like I was ripped off, but I only used one battery per season."
1,NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!,"I have had several of these. I agree with the others. Don't waste your money. One time water got into the housing, other times it wouldn't turn on by itself. I'll never buy a Melnor again."
1,Total piece of junk,Melnor 6-Cycle Electronic Aqua Timer #3015I had this device for three weeks when I found it had leaked internally and the battery contacts had rusted completely away. Now who would make a device designed to work near water with corrodible contacts? Melnor it seems. This device is just not make with any sense of quality. Do not buy it.
1,GARBAGE,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM WHICH WORKED FOR 1/2 A SUMMER THEN WENT SCREWY AND TURNED ON AN OFF AT WILL. THE SECOND ONE WORKED FOR 1 WEEK AND AFTER GETTING SOAKED TRYING TO SHUT IT OFF, I TOSSED IT ALSO. PURCHASED A DIFFERENT MODEL BY SAME MANUFACTURER, SAME GARBAGE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. (TRIED TO GIVE NO STARS, BUT IT WOULDN'T LET ME)"
2,Melnor 6 cycle water timer,"This Melnor irrigation clock is very easy to understand how to set. However, I prefer their 3 cycle dial-type clock. Unfortunately the old 3 cycle clock broke off where the hose-bib meets. The 6 cycle clock came on at a different time than was set and didn't turn off. It was hard to tell if the indicator meant it is set, or if it means time to set it, or if it means pause, because it was not consistent with the directions. I am in the market for the original dial-type 3 cycle again."
1,"Arrgghhhh, why do companies sell products that don't work!","I have 4 of these and two have already broken. I bought them hoping they would be better than Melnor's previous model (bigger, rectangular looking green thing) which all four broke within a year.NOTE, I take very good care of all of my tools. Change batteries, bring in during the winter, etc. This is a quality problem, not a user problem.I have lost plants and wasted a ton of time messing with these things, changing batteries, looking for receipts, etc.MELNOR, shame on you. This is irresponsible and you should recall and apologize for not doing your job (testing a product).)."
1,flooding in timer body,out of seven timers i purchased new at home depot four failed within a month. they filled full of water and the function failed and i kept them instead of returning them. anyway i could not recommend these for anyone who relies on performance
1,Junk . . . taking it back to Home Depot,"I wish I would have read the reviews here first. Bought a model 3015 at Home Depot today. (Picked the 2nd one in the display as it was obvious the first had been opened/returned. Should have taken that as a clue.) Installed it, turned on the water and gave it a slight twist to move the display to the side (out of the direct sun) and the top blew off. Water everywhere. Good thing I didn't leave it on and go to work!"
1,Crap shoot,"When they work they are great. I have just had 3, yes 3 of these timers that out of the box have not worked in the last three weeks. Massive floods, random on / off cycles, and no help from Melnor. Keep your receipt and buy local. You will probably be taking one back real soon. I have bought about ten of these over the last few years and have returned at least 6, maybe 7."
2,Electronic Aqua Timer,We really like this timer. It is exactly what we were looking for. It is so easy to program and also change the program when necessary. Plus the price was right. Hope you keep this timer around for a long time for when we need another one.
3,Best of the not so good hose timers - so far,"I'm buying two more of these Melnor model 3015 timers. One will replace a timer made by someone else that failed; the second is because I forgot to bring one of the two Melnors I already owned in for the winter and it broke. The first Melnor I bought has lasted three seasons so far. Took some work to figure out how to program it but once I got it, the timer worked as advertised. So I bought the second one and now am back for two more. Most battery operating watering timers are the pits. They leak; they break; they run down batteries faster than a speeding bullet and they plain just don't work! The Melnor timer I can live with. Just have to remember to bring it inside during the cold season -take the battery out."
1,Complete GARBAGE!!!!!,"Bought two of these, one couldn't keep time and the other leaked water into the electronics and stopped working the first day! Please don't waste your time and money."
1,Do NOT Buy the Melnor 3015 Timer,"I purchased two of these units from Home Depot a couple of days ago. Considering appearance, features and ease of programming, the unit seemed the ideal choice. After trying for over two hours to get them to work, I was unsuccessful. I finally went online to seek help and discovered that my experience is not unique. Do not waste your time on this product."
2,Expensive for three months operation,This item worked fine for three months and then broke. Had it replaced and the same thing happened. I abhor products that do not work as they should and do not last.Avoid this item!
1,Not worth it!,"I owned three of this things -- but it never last a whole season. low quality, it got flooded in the battery compartment, never get to work right. I can't return it anymore, so I need to buy different brand."
2,Failed after 2 seasons,Worked for two seasons then broke. The electronics remained operational but something inside leaked and flooded the battery compartment. The entire innards were under pressure and water was spewing out from cracks in the casing. Needless to say the battery compartment had corroded and I thought cleaning it out and putting in a new battery would be enough. But apparently the reason it corroded was from the internal valve leak.
1,Worst Timer Ever,"This is one of the worst if not the worst timer on the market. This review is not based on owning a single unit but three units that have all failed miserably. The longest one unit worked was one season. The operation is simple and the timing mechanism seems to perform adequately. All units failed internally at a seal, a valve or a hose connection. One flooded internally causing the battery to corrode and fail. The other two would leak water at the faucet side of the connection when the internal valve was closed. This was most likely due to a bad seal or cracked plastic. This unit is cheaply made and I warn all consumers to avoid this timer at all costs; you will only be disappointed."
1,Terrible product; stupid customer service.,"Bought one of those at H*** D****. It worked fine for 3 days then the automatic function failed. Wrote customer service and was told to refer to its website for warranty policy, which does not exist. Brought it back all the way from Asia for an exchange and the second one was dead on arrival. Had to chalk this one up as a loss as a result of my own bad judgement - should have just returned it."
1,New design- a giant step backwards,The previous generation of this time worked great. I have 4 older ones which have worked great for about nine years. Purchased a new one last month and it is already broken. It worked for two weeks and then it filled with water and of course it is now worthless. Avoid this timer
1,Wouldn't buy another one.,I bought two of these timers last year and they worked great...for three months. Both will not work this year (after storing in heated garage for the winter). Expensive and not worth the money.
1,Melnor 6-Cycle Timer - Inlet Breaks Off,"These timers appear to have one significant flaw. The inlet can easily break off leaving you with a timer that cannot connect to the hose bib. If you are lucky enough to get one that does not have the inlet pop off, or if you can glue it back on successfully, then these seem to work pretty well."
1,Breaks easily,"I used this product last summer because it was the only one that my home improvement center had for under $50. Well I went through 3 of them in one summer, because they kept breaking ( the timer stopped working, or the water seals broke). All I can say is that I didn't even get what I payed for. Don't buy this one!!!"
1,Cheap and not worth it,"This timer has very limited settings and those don't work. A week after installing it I tried to change the settings. The start time went crazy and kept cycling through the hours. And, of course, to take the battery out and force a reset requires dismounting the timer. Spend more on a different brand."
1,Do Not Buy This Timer!,"I bought 3 of these timers at Home Depot under the Vigoro brand, but they are the same POS. I installed 2 on parts of my mountain cabin's drip watering system. 1 failed after a week and stuck open, costing me $290.00 in wasted water (water is expensive there). The other failed while I was there and also stuck open. I replaced DIG 90001d timers that died after 5 years with this junk, trying to save money. Big mistake! At least the DIG timers fail in the closed position."
1,3 of 3 unusable,"Of the three I bought last year one still works but the lcd is unreadable, making them all unusable. Eight of the eight Gilmores are still working."
1,Excellent If Not Used In Wet Conditions,"I bought four of these timers at the beginning of the 2008 season and two were dead by mid-May. The reason: water enters them through the keypad. If your timer is located completely away from any rain or sprinkling activity, I suppose this unit would work fine. But don't expect it to last more than a few weeks if it is actually exposed to wetness. I have used two other models of timer before this-- one cheaper and one more expensive-- and neither ever failed over two to four seasons of use as a result of flooding."
1,one large flaw!,This product has a major flaw. It does not keep time. The time of day clock gains about an hour every 12 hours or so. I have to keep changing the time so that I water at the proper time.
1,This product has been recalled by Melnor,"I bought three of these this spring. Two failed by July. Went to my local Ace Hardware to return them, and was told the product has been recalled as defective. They gave me a full refund for all three, even the one that hadn't broken yet! There was a pile of them in the manager's office that had been returned after breaking!"
1,Great design with a fatal weakness,"This is a great timer with a weak plastic female connection on the top. Eventually, it will crack and spew water uncontrollably all over the place until you discover it and replace the timer. The connection cannot be replaced by the owner.This flaw is really a shame. If the timer had a metal connection, it would be the perfect garden timer."
1,Waste of time...er,"Is it possible to select less than one star for my rating?? Bought my first one at Home Depot. It worked like a charm until I connected it to the spigot. So off to Home Depot to foolishly exchange it. Got home and did a quick program and could hear the until switch on, so I figured I was good to go. Wrong! Put it on the spigot and it didn't do anything. Messed with it for a while longer trying to see if was me that just didn't understand how to program it, but it wasn't me. It was this worthless piece of junk. It's going back to the store tomorrow for a refund. I'll get something better. Vigoro should be ashamed of making / selling something this bad. I should have read reviews before buying it."
1,Another 1-star,"It worked great for about 3 months, then it flooded our back yard. The body leaked like a sieve, irreparable."
1,Terrible timer,Purchased the same item from Home Depot under the Vigoro name. Left it on for a summer and assumed that it was battery failure when it stopped working. This summer tried it out earlier. The timer just does not work! No flooding like others have experienced. It just does not go on and off at the programmed time.A complete waste of money. Melnor should have recalled these long ago! Do not buy under any circumstances!
5,Easy to set up and use,"This unit is easy to program. I've had several different kinds of water timers before and this is the 1st one that I've made a point to purchase again. We have rental property and we set this up in the spring, adjust it a couple of times during the summer and forget about it."
1,Horrible Product,I own 3 of these and they didn't last 1 year. They all lose time and one of them turns on at the wrong time and doesn't stay on the correct amount of time. Complete waste of money.
1,Never worked right from day 1,"We bought this under the Vigoro name at Home Depot. Got it home, installed a brand new battery in it, and hooked it up. I set it according to the directions. I wanted it to run every 3 days, coming on at 9 am and running for 2 hours.It came on once, at 12 midnight, and ran for 30 minutes. I reset it the next day, installed another brand new battery, again set for 3 days, on at 9 am, run for 2 hours.That night it came on again at 12 midnight, ran for 30 minutes.This is a hunk of junk and should NOT be purchased. I just hope Home Depot will take it back... that's $30 or so I'd like have back."
1,Waste of money and time,"This product ""upgrade"" replaces the round model. The previous model at least worked for a year. This model releases water into the inside which of course destroys it. I tried 4 times. There is obviously a need for such a product, but this is not one to purchase. It is easy to program, but what is the use when it breaks so quickly. This product should not be sold!"
1,Non-starter,Tried two of these and neither one would connect without leaking. The second one flooded inside as well. Don't bother.
1,Does not shut off,"Waste of money, just like all Menlor products. I've bought 5 different Menlor/Vigoro timers and all 5 have failed within 2 years. I'm the fool for buying them, but I won't anymore. It's convenient to get them from Home Depot, but I'll never make that mistake again. This particular model failed right out of the package. The on/off switch would not shut off."
5,Melnor 3015 Water Timer,"I have been using drip systems in my garden for over 20 years and have tried many different timers. I started using this one two years ago, and it is the best and most reliable I have found and reasonably priced. Joan Conlan"
1,junk,"I bought two of these, and they both had to be replaced. One failed after 24 hours; the other lasted a week."
1,Broken after four months,"Worked fine for four months. The battery died, and when I went to change it I could not remove the plug to get to it. The rubber gasket around the battery compartment door melted and sealed it shut. The plastic cracked when I tried to get it open. There was water in the battery compartment, so I doubt it would have worked anyway.I won't be buying any more Melnor products."
1,Junk,I bought this timer at home depot and would not recommend it to anyone. I followed instructions and it didn't even work. Don't waste your time or money!
2,"Worked for a while, then broke","Bought this water timer a year and a half ago. It survived through the first winter, but did not make it through the second one: the rubber output valve leaked."
1,never again,Bought from Home Depot - never worked right - took a while to get it to start at the right time - when I accomplished this small feat the next challenge is getting to turn off - I am returning it - do not buy this - waste of time and water - ps I am back in the states for a while - cheers
2,"No, it doesn't","""Works with low pressure drip and soaker hoses"" says the description. No. No, it doesn't. I tried hooking it up to my rain barrel and there wasn't enough pressure to make it function. On a normal spiggot, though, it seems to work fine. I've had it watering an area where I laid down grass seed. I set it up to turn the sprinkler on every 6 hours and run for 5 minutes, and it seems to be handling the job just fine."
1,Junk,"Terrible product. I bought 3 of these at one time. The first filled with water on the first use. Contacted Melnor and they replaced it. The replacement doesn't water at all. Neither does one of the others. The third does water, but I have it scheduled to water every 3 days and it goes off every day instead."
1,Worst product I've ever owned,"I had high hopes for this timer. Looked solid, did what I need by looking at the directions and box. Boy was I wrong. The valve on top is horrible. I bought 5 of these and all 5 of them broke at the top. The sales clerk at Home Depot said they're thinking about not carrying them anymore with all the problems they've had. I also had a problem reprogramming it. I originally had it set to go once a day but when I switched it to once every 3 days it still stayed on the once a day program.. Not worth the money at all."
2,Great while it lasted.,"I bought this product from Home Depot last year and it was just what I needed after laying down new sod. After getting the hang of it, it was easy to program and worked flawlessly. However, after storing it away for the winter and taking it back out this season, I regret to say that it was busted. After opening up the case to replace the battery, I found the battery compartment was filled with water and the contact were corroded - much like an earlier review. I tried replacing the battery, but to no avail."
1,Work once and does not work anymore.,"Work once and does not work anymore, very good user interface but very poor product quality; wasted my time and my money. It is not recommended."
1,Poor Quality,"Worked fine for two weeks and then stopped. Opened battery compartment to check and the inside was full of water. Battery, etc. was ruined."
2,Do not buy if you intend to use more than a season.,"These are great timers but just for a single season. I have 5 of these in my yard. I have had to replace them every season. At cost of $29.00 it gets expensive. Easy to program, but not very reliable."
1,Melnor-Bad product line,"I have owned several melnor products and found that none of them last more than a season. They are all my Home Depot carries so they were my only choice. Electric and manual, they are definitely not made to last. I recommend you look elsewhere."
2,Will not last longer than a year.,"Works for a while but I've been through the third and last of these timers. Every year, I have to buy a new one. The first two just quit working and wouldn't turn on even with a new battery. This last one flooded out the interior and was completely destroyed... I even removed the battery and stored it indoors for the winter. A outdoor timer should last longer than a year. Enough."
2,"Bad from the get go, dead in 4 days","I did not realize my ""Vigro"" was the previous model to the Melnor 3015 I purchased earlier this week - The Vigro would not power up this summer, and the Melnor worked for 4 days, and worked POORLY. Used a set of 2 AA batteries every day. My only hope is that the company will somehow make it right.Update 7/16/2012An email to the company at an address I found on their website has resulted in an apology and I've been told a new one will be shipped to me in the next 2-3 days. Gave them an extra star just for the service. If the new one works for longer than 4 days, I will add another star."
5,water timer,I have been using two of these to control watering of fruit trees and vegetables for the past three years. They have been reliable. Programming is easy and it's really easy to change the water-on duration time and to switch on manual watering. I wrote this review because I was looking on-line to get a spare unit and found the $57 tag way too much.
1,Poor quality,Product was used for just 2 seasons (May-Sept). At the end of each season battery was removed and replaced in spring with new battery. Item never was wet and internal parts as well as external look new; but no longer works. The last Melnor unit only lasted 1 season. Think they want it to fail. Needs engineering fix. Their service line is always busy! I do not recommend.
1,A Giant Step Backward,"I can't find Melnor's round timer anymore. It worked pretty good. Got one in the backyard that's bulletproof and will last 6 months on 1 9v battery. This one, apparently the replacement for it, is just crap. Won't hold the time...won't run the program consistently...goes through batteries in no time flat. Works great on manual, though.In short, don't waste your money."
1,Water Time Dissatisfaction,"This timer only lasted three weeks. It failed to function while I was on vacation which was the very reason it was purchased. Apparently something was not sealed correctly in the device and the entire battery compartment flooded with water, rusting all the connections and causing it's failure."
1,Junk,This was the fanciest timer at home depot so I got it. Program options looks nice and worked fine for about a month. After that it just stopped working. I replaced the battery but it keeps shutting off. Junk.
4,works for me,"I have used this timer for three years and it is still working. The reason I am not giving 5 stars are, firstly it's not convenient to do a Ad Hoc watering say for 20 mins one time without interrupting the programmed schedule. Secondly, since I remove it during the winter time and forgot to take the battery out (not sure if it helps though), the battery already died the next spring you use it. Have to change the battery every year."
1,Very disappointing,"I purchased 5 of these timers. Of the 4 I've set up, 3 of them have problems with timing (run too often, unrelated to the program I've set up). The 4th had a leaky gasket and filled with water so I'm not sure whether the timer worked correctly or not. The customer service person was frustrated the two times I called but has agreed to replace the units. Now that I see the problems others have had, I may save myself some hassle and find an alternative product."
4,Pretty good - liked the old design,"Picture wasn't right for this. I was trying to order the older version and got the newer digital display with buttons one. It's functioning pretty well, but I liked the old one better. Buttons on the new one don't seem to work consistently. Otherwise fine."
5,Saviour,"I live in the desert (Las Vegas) and if you miss a day watering, plants will die. This Timer is easy to install and program, and never misses a day. It is a Savior."
4,What We All Need,"My only disappointment with this CD is that I thought it was a ""live"" album recorded during Snatam Kaur's Celebrate Peace Tour.Otherwise, a nice compilation from Snatam Kaur. If you are familiar with her material, you will enjoy this offerring and if this is your first experience, the CD is a good place to begin, with songs from several of her CD's.I wish we all would jump on the ""Peace Bandwagon."" It's what the world needs. What a great idea to tour for peace.You can feel the devotion in Snatam's music, which goes beyond any words.By all means, I would recommend this CD."
5,Peace....something we all could use more of....,"Snatum Kaur can do no wrong....she only repeats herself when she needs to, to make a valid point and her music sends me to another place! I'm addicted!"
1,complaint,"I am very annoying because this compact is lined, with small spaces in target. I wanted to know as amazon responds before this type of event, since I finish retiring it of the customs. It was completly closed and when opening it and putting on the radio I founded with this disagreeable surprise. It would be thankful that it was sent to me again since in addition to the cost of compac, the customs shipment and taxes command post encounter whereupon compact practically does not serve to me."
5,NOT FOR WUSSIES - THIS BOOK IS SO HILARIOUS IF YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR!,"I laughed all the way through this book and could totally relate to her style of humor. If you are a prissy wuss that sits around and tries to be Ms Perfect and think your child can't be watched by anyone but you, this is not for you. If you are an individual and honor your sense of independence and may have been a rock star at some point in you life, you will enjoy this book!"
2,Fooled by 5 star reviews,"I thought a humorous parenting book with so many 5 star reviews must be pretty good!Wrong!I have two kids now and have read a LOT of this genre over the last 5 years and usually really enjoy it. To me, this books humor felt forced, slightly angry or aggressive, and clumsy. I think their might be merit to the idea that some of these reviews were seeded. I looked through several of the negative review's comments and they were mostly made by people who had never made any other comment or review before. That just seems suspicious to me.Bottom line, maybe people did enjoy this book- not everyone has the same tastes, but I for one did not find it funny. I saw it trying to be, but it never made me laugh once. I gave up half way through."
1,full of unoriginal cliches,"I read a lot of parenting books, and was hoping this book would be a light-hearted take on motherhood. I found it to be tasteless and not worth the time to read. For the most part it was full of over-used old cliches on parenthood. However, there were some things that were also offensive (joking about extreme postpartum depression)....save your money!"
2,the blog is better,"I enjoyed the author's blog so much that I went out and got her book. Sad to say it was not as genuine, funny, touching, or engaging as her on-line writing. too bad!"
2,Not what I expected,"I got this book as a gift after I had my daughter and didn't even finish it, although it's a fast-read book because the tone was pretentious. I may have smirked once or twice, but it's definitely not the book you need as a new mom. If your a new mom trying to embrace your new role, and you don't happen to share the author's very specific philosophies, it comes across as just plain ANNOYING!!!"
1,Defensiveness thinly disguised as no-nonsense,"I admit there were some parts that were funny, but overall, this book is pretty much worthless. First of all, it's alienating to moms who choose to make different choices than the author, such as making baby food yourself, or even buying organic! The funny thing is, she complains about women making their own baby food and then complains that baby food is ""too expensive,"" not even acknowledging that making your own is a fraction of the cost and is in fact the reason why most women opt to do just that.She can be witty at times, but most of the time she comes across as being harshly judgmental and defensive. A good friend of mine gave it to me as a gift, because she thought it ""seemed funny"" from the parts she read. I didn't tell her how much I hated it, but I really thought it was awful. And the references to celebrity gossip are totally annoying and shallow. On the upside, I guess it will make the book dated before too long."
5,Invaluable resource for new moms! Hilarious!,"I can't tell you how much I loved this book! I cried because I laughed so hard! I plan to give this book as gifts to my friends as we are all at that age now where we graduated college and are getting married and having babies! I have an 8 month old, and this book really brought some things into perspective. Stephanie is a great author and comedian and I hope she writes more books! I'm buying! I had this read in 2 days flat, even with a sick 8 month old on my hands! How's that for good reading!"
1,Very Dissapointed,"The title is catchy, and a lot of the anecdotes are funny, but overall I find this to be a rather dangerous book. I feel sorry for Stephanie Wilder-Taylor because of the mismanagement of breastfeeding, bonding, and new mama care following her baby's birth. Then, rather than get angry at the hospital for their lack of support, she writes a book to advocate for other parents to not breastfeed?I understand that some women need to supplement with formula or are unable to breastfeed at all. That doesn't make formula feeding ""just as good"" as breastfeeding."
1,Someone actually published this woman?,"Is it just me or is this woman an extreme alchoholic? There was rarely a page that went by that alchohol was not mentioned. That must be the REAL reason she didn't breastfeed. I found this book frightening because she wrote everything matter-of-fact and made anyone not like her sound stupid-people are going to read this book and believe it! I fell in love with my babies before they were born, I breastfed, I co-sleep, and yes, I'm going to homeschool. I normally like books like this but I'll takes Jenny McCarthy's book any day of the week- that's pee-in-your-pants humor. Sorry, no recommendations from me."
1,Couldn't even finish it I was so annoyed,"I had to put this one down before I finished it because I was so annoyed at the way the author continued to tell us she's all for anyone doing things differently than she, but then calling them bad names and insulting them for their choices. A hypocrit and a potty-mouth and I wouldn't keep her as a friend. It would be excusable if it made me laugh, but I didn't crack a smile the whole time."
2,Offensive,"This book is a fast read and I did chuckle here and there. But I don't understand why Wilder-Taylor is so disparaging towards mothers who had births they feel great about, enjoyed breastfeeding and co-sleeping, choose to homeschool, use cloth diapers or make their own babyfood.I was looking forward to reading this knowing she has a large following and I usually enjoy ""Mama lit,"" but the writing is flat and uninspiring. She certainly does not foster any sense of inclusion within mothers."
4,"The strangest ""what to expect"" book ever written","This is perhaps the strangest ""what to expect"" book ever written. A funny and irreverent look at new parenthood, combined with some practical advice. Along the way she skews übermoms, parenting fads, crazed ""lactivists"" (the kind of folks who think kids should be breast fed until college) and her own attempts at parenthood. If you are expecting, have kids, vaguely remember having children at some point, or just thinking about it, this is a book for you.And do not be put off by the title; fathers will enjoy the book too.Be warned, however, that it is a bit on the raunchy side, so if you are squeamish about those things, find another book."
1,This book is offensive!,"Yes, Ms. Wilder-Taylor does point out the more amusing aspects of pregnancy and motherhood, however her approach is not impressive. She needs to take her vulgar language and drinking habits back to the trailer park and leave the writing to someone with a lot more tact."
5,A new-mom must have!,"This book is great! I was starting to go just a little bit insane taking care of my newborn and this book pulled me back from the edge. It got me laughing again (which was something that my husband hadn't been able to do in weeks) and really made me take a step back and find the humor in the stuff that I was going through. It was actually almost too funny, I'd bust out laughing while rocking the baby (reading with one hand whild holding the baby with the other is a wonderful skill to develope) and wake her up again!Hilarious and sneakily insightful, this book is worth it's weight in gold. It was instrumental in getting me through those awful Baby Blues.I will definitely buy copies for any of my friends and family who become parents."
1,Potty Mouths Are Not for Authors,"I was looking forward to reading this book, but after reading a few pages of gratuitous cursing, I closed the book. I admit that Wilder-Taylor is funny, but I personally got distracted by the foul language."
4,Laugh out loud funny!,"Hilarious! A tell-all book for real moms. If you are a mother, plan to be a mother, know a mother, or just need a good laugh, read it! With perfectly written, short chapters, its the type of book you can throw in your bag for a spur of the moment read. If you are the type of mother who wears T-shirt's that say ""Taylor's mom"" and drive a mini van with those family stick-figure stickers on the back..you may want to skip it...on the other hand...I take that back...you should read it! Do us all a favor!"
5,Great book!,"This book is hysterical! I buy it for all of my friends that are first time moms! The author is a comedian, so you know it will be funny. Great gift for first pregnancy. She also has another book, Naptime is the new happy hour. Also very funny."
3,"Not great, not horrible","I see that people either love this book or hate it. I thought it was just so, so. The humor was sort of forced Saturday Night Live painful sketch style. The concept is good - lighten up about this babyhood business - but there are so many judgmental moments, it feels a lot like those other ""how to be the right mother"" books. What if us mommies really did lighten up and just accepted the idea that everyone does the best they can. At least we're better than gerbils!"
2,I can't believe she got paid to write this!,"I just have to say, I barely review anything but had to comment on this book..that's how strongly I felt about it.First of all, this is better than 'Dirty Little Secrets,' which was something more suitable for a website than a book! Second, this author just loves to complain about baby products that didn't work for her (as if they would never work for anyone else) and only wants to promote her way. I might have found her funny if she was a bit humble about her opinions. Her husband must be a publisher because she doesn't even write well!"
5,This book will make you laugh on the worst days!!,"I received this book when I was 5 months pregnant, and I loved it then, but now that my daughter is 6 months old, it takes on a whole new meaning. The author is one of the few brave enough to write about the good bad and the ugly of being a new mom. Some of her expierences are a lot worse than mine, but that just makes me laugh (and feel really lucky). I've given this book to 3 of my ""new mommy"" friends. They all love it. ALSO, my husband, who is a physician, read parts of the book, too (the parts I just had to share with him) and he loved it, too. THIS BOOK IS A GREAT GIFT FOR NEW MOMMY'S, OLD MOMMY'S, NEW DADDY'S, OLD DADDY'S, AND EVEN GRANDPARENTS WHO NEVER HAD BOOKS LIKE THIS WHEN THEY WERE NEW PARENTS!"
5,Happy to know I am not alone,"This book made me laugh out loud. I am so happy to learn that I am not the only one who feels this way about parenting. Having a child with colic, this book helped me get through the day and see the light at the end of the tunnel."
3,Entertaining...,"I read this book while I was pregnant. It was a good read during the last few weeks of almost unbearable pregnancy. While I was pregnant I felt that I would be ready to go back to work after six weeks and that bottle feeding is the way to go. Then after my son was born I felt that breastfeeding was the best thing to give him and there is no way I'm leaving my baby at a day care for 10 hours a day. So, this book was great for entertainment purposes and keeps you grounded, but don't use it as a resource for child rearing."
4,hilarious!,"This book is a hilarious look at new motherhood! It's also reassuring for those of us who feel like less-than-perfect mothers. Some people might be a bit offended; you must like sarcastic humor to enjoy this book. I recommend it most for new moms whose babies are less than a year old. My baby is 14 months old, and I'll be reading Naptime Is the New Happy Hour next!"
1,Simple and Overdone,"This book takes all the normal cliches and overplays the jokes - it's dumbed down ""entertainment"" that's not all that entertaining."
1,"I like her sense of humor, but...","This is just one in a long line of ""yeah I have a baby but that's not going to affect my life one bit"" books. As others have mentioned, her breastfeeding section is just sad. If the author wants to use formula, that's fine. No reason to bash moms who nurse.Can't recommend this book at all."
1,sippy cups are not for chardonnay and this books is not for laughs!,I purchased this book based on the reviews. Not as funny as other reviewers say. I kept reading the book in hopes if it getting better. I was very disappointed.
1,Offensive? Yes. Funny? No,"This book was not funny at all. I consider myself an open person. If a mother wants to breastfeed, then she should breastfeed. If she prefers formula, then use formula. There can even be a happy medium (I used both). This book made breastfeeding mothers sound like selfish, nosey, busybodies who have nothing better to do than dish out unwanted advice. It implied that mothers who chose to use formula were victims. I found the material and language to be offensive and insulting."
4,Great book for new Mom's (with a sense of humor),"Being a new mom, I seriously recommend this book to anyone who is feeling overwhelmed. It brings a sense of hilarity to all those things that don't seem funny at the time."
1,Absolute Junk,"Like many others who have reviewed this sprinkler, I hold the opinion that it is junk. I paid extra because of the claim of ""all metal"" and the lifetime warranty. Within the first few uses, it stopped oscillating. Will work for a couple of hours and then gets stuck. I'd avoid this one. In fact, I doubt I'll be inclined to buy anything from this company. If this is their top of the line model, how good can the cheap stuff be?"
2,Metal Construction Fooled Me....Don't Make My Mistake!,"Gosh, I hate cheap sh**. I was duped into buying this at the hardware store a few years ago because I saw the metal housing and associated that with ""quality"". I could kick myself for that now. The sprinkler has a nice solid metal frame, but the oscillating mechanism is made of cheap plastic. Within a year of use it started getting stuck at the end of each oscillation. I tried tinkering with the settings and adjusting the water volume, all to no avail. I broke it out for use today after it was stored away all winter, and now the thing gets stuck every few seconds.I'm going to contact Melnor in hopes of finding replacement parts for this thing. It would be a real shame to throw away this nice metal frame because of the flimsy plastic mechanics.I should point out that after use I always stored it out of the elements. Turns out that was a wasted effort!"
1,all-metal and all-broken too,"I bought this sprinkler because it was 'heavy duty' and all metal. Sadly, the drive train is all plastic and promptly broke, leaving me with a sprinkler that won't oscillate. I strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this item."
1,Don't buy this sprinkler!,"I've bought three of these 360M's and two of them failed after I made the fatal mistake of touching the area limiter controls--one of them after using it 4 times! The only one I have that is still working is on its 3rd season now, and I'm sure that's because I've never so much as looked hard at the controls.Don't buy this sprinkler! If you already have one and it's working, don't touch the controls!"
2,"Looks Good, Doesn't Hold Up","I am a bit disappointed, and my grass is brown. I bought this sprinkler a few years ago. It worked well for the first 2 or 3 seasons, but wasn't oscillating properly last summer. I called Melnor and they were very kind. Because of the warranty, they offered to send me a new gear or replace my sprinkler. I chose to have my sprinkler replaced. I hope that this newer version holds up for more than 3 summer seasons!"
1,Junk - will not oscillate,"I decided to try a high cost sturdy sprinkler for a change. Did not oscillate from the first day. Moves in one direction, and then sits there clicking with no return movement. Tried a half dozen different settings with no change in performance. Don't waste your money."
1,Junk; Don't Bother,"Never worked from day one. Did not oscillate. Light weight, poor quality, don't waste your money"
1,BIG disappointment---AVOID this product!!,"I purchased this sprinkler because it appeared to be a quality product, with the frame being solidly built of rust-proof aluminum. I assumed that the motor would be as well built, but I was seriously mistaken. As other reviewers have written, the motor ceased oscillating and began to ""stick"" less than a month after purchase. Talk about annoying! Needless to say, I returned this sprinkler for a refund, and bought a cheaper, yet more reliable oscillating sprinkler at a fraction of the cost. This is the second Melnor product that I've owned that has performed poorly, and after this experience I will certainly avoid purchasing any more of their ""junk"". I would recommend the same to all others."
1,Lasted 2 months,"Stupid me, I thought a more expensive $30 oscillating sprinkler would last longer than my previous $5 oscillating sprinkler. Wrong. I purchased this in May 2012, today is July 15, 2012 and it won't oscillate anymore. If water pressure is the issue as stated in another review, why did it work for 2ish months and then suddenly stop working? Yes, I made sure the screen at the hose connection was clean. I even took it apart best I could to see if I could figure out the issue, the oscillating/gear system is sealed. So frustrating."
1,Avoid these units!!,"I am on my 4th Melnor oscillating sprinkler! The first 3 failed. ie no longer oscillates, leaks like a sieve. I have tried different models. While the hardware is metal, the oscillating part is made of cheap plastic. Brand new the oscillator failed, and after several trips to Home Depot, this one worked for a while and then it too stopped oscillating. Now it leaks like my previous one did!Find another oscillating sprinkler!"
1,Worked fine for one season,I expect more from a $30+ sprinkler and will never buy another Melnor product as a result of this experience. Was never stepped on or thrown (until it quit oscillating anyhow). Junk.
1,Can't Keep It Running!,"The oscillating mechanism of the sprinkler failed within the first 30 minutes of operation. We called the manufacturer, explained the problem and were promised replacement parts immediately. We received the parts, installed them and put the sprinkler in operation immediately. It performed for approximately 8 hours and has failed again. We are in a quandry at the moment: Should we contact amazon.com and ask for our money back or should we contact Melnor for repair parts again."
1,Stuck again,I bought a second Melnor Oscillating sprinkler to replace the one that kept getting stuck. The new one stuck just like the first. How frustrating! I won't be buying Melnor products again.
3,finding replacement part,We have two of these GardenBloom sprinklers and both have lost the very small black screw-type end.I'm sure they are both in our grass but walking without shoes I still can't find them.Where can I get two of these small screws? I've tried all my local garden centers. thank you
2,"Solid frame, unreliable oscillation","I have 2 of these, probably bought at different times from local hardware store. The sturdy looking construction drew me in. The plastic oscillation assembly is actually pretty robust looking, but innards are apparently not up to snuff. One of them continues to work fine, but the other only travels in one direction and fails to rotate back after reaching the arc limiter."
1,Cheap Junk!,"Like everyone else, it stopped oscillating after about a week. Avoid Melnor products like the plague unless you like wasting money."
2,It worked for a season.,"My complaint is that of many others. The sprinkler worked exactly as stated for a summer. This summer, it started sticking in one position. Now it doesn't oscillate at all."
2,So close,"I'm so sad that the green metal Melnor I have that does work well doesn't have a part number anywhere on it that I can find (adjustable, but not clicky like this silver one). This one has three problems the other one didn't: some of the holes would clog, it would quit oscillating from time to time, and the range of oscillation would be off center."
5,WATER PRESSURE TO **HIGH***,"All of you who are not happy with the best spinkler out thereIT'S BECAUSE YOUR WATER PRESSURE IS TO HIGH(****PUT***) a cut off valve at the spinkler and ajust itand away it will go, I have 8 of these and they are all 10 years plus oldI saw the reviews and hoped to help"
5,One of the best,"This book is fascinating, not only because of its priciple subject, but because Schlesinger brings to life the personalities and events surrounding RFK's life. J. Edgar Hoover, Joe Macarthy, Martin Luther King, and the kings of organized crime all play prominantly, and the reader learns as much about the zeigeist of Kennedy's time as RFK himself.This is one the best biographies and history books that I have read. It is also long and detailed, and written from an intimate and personal perspective. Schlesinger was a family friend of the Kennedy's and many of his observations about their family life are recorded.This book is still considered the definative biography on Kennedy's life, and I highly recommend it."
3,A dirty player,"Robert Kennedy played to win. The idea that he was a champion of the little guy is a myth. If you look at his record, you'll see that he was involved up to his neck in nefarious operations. A lot of material was not avaialble for this book - especially some recent de-classified material which shows that RFK not only knew about the plans to assasinate Castro but was deeply involved in the attempt to destroy him and Cuba - take a look at:http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/cuba_mis_cri/620119%20Meeting%20with%20the%20Attorney%20Gen..pdf."
4,"History that reads like a novel,","or one of those long running soap operas from the golden age of radio. Characters coming & going then reappearing later in the story. There are villians, heroes, heroines, conspiracy & even murder.This excellent, informative work evokes two eras. First its subject matter giving us a history of Washington during the Civil War. This subject has not been covered as heavily as the various battles & endless biographies of the notable figures of that war. The book was written 76 years after the war. Here we are 62 years after that listening to Ms. Leech words, also of a different era than our own. The language in which it was written is quaint, colloquil & even offensive to some in our time. That is part of it significance as an important work. It is also an entertaining history book. Imagine that."
4,Washington during the Civil War,"This is an interesting look at what was going on in the nation's capital during the war with a look at the hospitals, nursing care, saloons, and man on the street of 19th century DC."
4,Dave Ellesmere - Angry Young Computer,"Well, for an album called _Angry Young Computer_, it starts off happily enough with the gleaming tech-house of ""Doing Things on Impulse"" -- but then again, this is Kanzleramt, better known for smooth tech-house than angry industrial clanging. ""Isolated Blue Cube"" does go on the noisier edge of techno, with its blocky synths and gravelly reverb, and the static and long tones of ""Optisoma"" show Ellesmere's slower side. But the kick drums start back up with ""Part of Something,"" and with ""M M S,"" he brings in a whisper of Basic Channel, but accelerated to match our fast-paced modern society. The longer ""Spring Ding"" has some bright tech-jazz to it (with the spring portion coming in the form of modulated bird calls at the end). Pleasant, yes; angry, not so much."
5,Seductive and Ethereal,"I was immediately mesmerized on hearing this on Soundscapes. Michael Whalen has composed and performed the most haunting and lingering piano sounds I have heard in a long time. You feel each piano note deeply, sometimes holding a breath not wanting to miss its penetrating moment. It is not only seductive it is intoxicating. I have played it for listening and for dining, all my friends and guests are captivated by it."
2,not my first choice,"This book has a very small section that talks specifically about Basenjis.The rest of this book is a formula book. The remaining pages area standard text of average quality advice on dog care some of whichmay be irrelevant to Basenjis.Thepublisher has one for many breeds and they are all exactly the same-savea small section on the specific breed. If I had to choose only oneBasenji book it would not be this one. I would Choose Susan Coesand Elspet Fords would be my second. I also own Stacked and MovingA unique book worth owning, but perhaps only to one interested in theshowring.So I would say that owning Basenjis by Jack Shafer, and R. Mankeyis nice, there are by the way nice color photos, but not if you need a definative text on the subjectof Basenjis."
1,Not very specific for Basenji owners...,"I will not ruminate about what the previous reviewer said. I will just say that they are absolutely correct when they say this is a ""formula book"" save a few pages specifically about this breed and most of the pictures are of basenjis.I just wanted to add that if you have any doubt of what I speak, I will just say that pages 100-106 describe ways to ""modify the behavior of your dog"" and are about how to stop your dog from BARKING and waking up the neighbors!!!I think that's enough said on that. If you have or have been around a basenji, you know that this is a preposterous thing to spend four pages on... :-)"
5,mary karlzen rocks!!!!,"hide is one of mary's first cds and although it is an ep it is one of the best. in the early days she played quite a bit in florida and i have seen her live a half a dozen times in tampa and all you have to do is hear her play St. James Hotel under the oaks at Skipper""s Smokehouse to know you have seen a true rocker. you must buy this cd."
2,High pitched Whining,"Has ample power for my system which includes: Core i7-930, 6 gig mem, 1-EVGA GeForce460 graphics card, Asus P6x58D-E motherboard, 1-HD, and one 1-DVD drive.BUT this is not a quiet unit! It has a high pitched ragged whine which is annoying and increases in volume goes up and down with each mouse the mouse. This may be from the fan but it seems more likely that its coming from the electronics.Also, as one review wrote, it does not have the the plugs necessary to power a second high performance graphics card."
2,Not What I Expected...,"I read so many good things about OCZ Power Supplies that I decided to buy one and try it for myself. One word, Disappointed. Yes, this beautiful looking and expensive piece of hardware crapped out on me shortly after being installed. If my memory serves me right, it lasted about 3 or 4 months. It used to be on a rig with the following specs: XFX 775 nforce 680i Motherboard, Intel E8400 CPU, OCZ Reaper Series PC2-8500 DDR2 Memory 2x2GB, EVGA 8800GT Video Card, 2 7200 Hard Drives, 2 DVD Burners.I expected this rig to run smoothly and it had enough power for an SLI upgrade in the future. Instead, I got 4 pounds of electronic junk. I bought an Ultra 600 W PSU, which has great looks too, BTW, and is running fine.My advice is, stay away from this model."
4,"Terrific little book, but don't forget the dogs","This is a wonderful, funny, humorous, cute human self-help book and commentary on the feline nature akin to The Pekinese Who Saved Civilization."" There's a bit of cats-versus-dogs bias when Xena says, ""Our brains are more like human brains than dog brains are. The order in rank, I believe, is cat brain, human brain, and then dog brain.""My dog however looked over the slight to his canine brothers and sisters and saw the brilliance in Xena's views. Contrast that with we humans, who write books such as The Savage Nation, Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them and Bushwhacked.Forget the human nonsense and read Xena's book, with amusing quotes from real cats. But how about a little cross-species cooperation and including what dogs have to say about cats? How about teaching dogs and cats to just get along?"
5,An outstanding story of an adventurer par excellence!,This is without a doubt the best seafaring story I have read since reading Joshua Slocum's account of his sailing adventures. Would make a wonderful film if produced by someone careful enough to make the details realistic.
5,Great Jazz for fans of Christmas,"Seems everybody cranks out a Christmas album at some time or another but this is great jazz for any time of the year. Christian McBride really shines on ""Deck the Halls"" and Betty Carter's unique style on ""Let It Snow"" is classic. I've owned it since its release it's still a favorite."
4,what great singers we have lost recently,this is a terrific CD.a big sounding band that will swing you thru all those mince pies with great style.Abbey Lincoln is absolutely marvellous on #This Christmas#. the arrangement is nice and she hops and skips throu the tune with uplifting joy.Betty Carter is also worth hearing in front of a bigger bandand then Shirley Horn gives us a version of Merry Xmas that avoids similarities with Nat King Cole.what a shame that all these great ladies of jazz have moved on.Only one turkey in all this feast : the completely corny guitar work sounding like George Benson in ultra vapid mode. A real shame as it is out of place alongside the modern arrangements.More please Verve....
5,Favorite Post-Rock record ever.,"I love this record, I love Jakob across their discography, but this is the standout for me. I have listened to this type of music for at least 20 years (straight arc back through shoegaze and noise sculpture) this is a high point, it is mesmerizing and melodic. Heavy, and definitely rooted in rock but something else all together. I love it."
3,Dinah Washington is Amazing,"Dinah Washington has an amazing amount of strength behind her voice. I love this album, and I listen to it frequently. My only qualm is that some of the lyrics sound a bit ""submissive"", in terms of the level of dependence a woman should place upon a man (which I really shouldn't be surprised by). Nevertheless, I find myself singing along or having these songs stuck in my head."
5,Best book about Menopause,When I started going though menopause I thought I better read up on the subject so I will know what is happening to my body. I bought this book for my husband and read it also. This book is written by a man for men. I learned more from this book than any other menopause book I read. He explained thing in a non medical way that was so easy to understand. I have shared this book with many women I work with and they have love it too!!
3,A simple guide with a lot of info and educated man already knows,"I read the book first to get an idea or what was in it. Admitedly, my husband has a PhD in biology so he thinks he knows it all. Unfortunatey tht has more to do with animals other than humans. I have highlighted the particular points that I think he could use a little understanding about.If a husband is truly confused about the whole process it may be worthwhile to have him read it...or you read it to him. Then discuss the issues that are still a mystery."
3,Mommy's Take on This....,"My child received this for her 4th birthday. The concept is a good one, but the ""eraser bar"" doesn't erase very well. I have to slide it back and forth a dozen times, and it still doesn't completely clear the screen. My child doesn't mind it, but it sure bugs me!"
3,"tested, and not happy","My sister had purchased this for my 2 year old for christmas (2005), she loves her magnadoodles so we thought perfect gift. So I looked it up to check out the reviews, I became worried when I saw that it was commented that erasing was difficult. So I opened it to test it, it is correct to erase a picture you have to swipe the eraser more that ten times. NOT worth my time and 2 year olds do not exactly understand not to press hard."
1,"Extremely Disappointed, Crayola!","Our daughter received this for Christmas 2005, and we couldn't wait to open it for her. It is very easy to assemble, and the first time you write on the board it's great. When you try to erase your art, it won't erase! The magnetic board is cheaply made, and absolutely will not completely erase, no matter how many times you swipe the eraser bar. We were VERY disappointed with this item, and would recommend that if you are considering this toy for your child, you should pass. Get them a Magna Doodle instead, those work wonderfully!"
4,good toy,"everybody said erasing is very difficult, but it is easy and very clean if you guys move the erasing bar slowly.... really it works very well, my kid does not have problem erasing it... she knows very well...the projector arm is little shakey...."
1,Terrible quality; absolutely NO quality!!!,"I have since seen other similar complaints on several websites and have written to polyconcept. I have to date gotten no satisfaction from either crayola or polyconcept. The lines are blurry, there is no focus to begin with. But the real problem is that the projector detaches constantly from the base, whenever you move it, touch it, etc. The dry erase markers don't erase from the board; and the light stopped working after the second time my son played with it. I can't fathom buying a new light bulb at $4.95 + s&h after a total hour of use in two sessions. I think it's probably wiring; who knows; but it's a disappointing flimsy cheap piece of garbage."
1,wrong size,Corks shipped are different size than specification. specification identifies a 8 x 1 3/4 cork. Product shipped was 9 x 1 3/4. No way it'll fit my bottles. How do you know what you'll get?
1,"Service is fine, product isn't.","It may just be that my belly button is small, but the piercing stuck out waaaay too far. I would only suggest this if you have a deep innie."
3,Starts out well,"This book starts out well, good idea. About half way through it becomes obvious the writer (cartoonist) has run out of ideas. Last half drags."
2,Not quite the 'quality' I'd expect....,"This isn't a bad recording, just not as good as Ms. Horn's studio work. The performance is ok, but nothing special by any stretch of the imagination.If you like MP3's, you won't mind this one...but if your listening to something besides an HT setup, ie, real STEREO, you'll be disappointed, IMHO.L'wood"
4,Ghostdog,"The 4 stars are for the ""The Blind Swordsman"". I give zero stars to the company that put this out. Last Year I bought all six double DVD packages of the first year of the TV Series. When I saw this compilation I thought it was all 26 episodes of season 2 in two separate packages. I was happy at the reduced price from last year and ""Very Unhappy"" that it was just a repackaging of Season One. I will now wait and be sure that what I'm buying from this company is what it purports to be. They should have listed the episode titles on the box, then I would have known I'd seen them before. I'm really disappointed with Tokyo Shock & Media Blasters. I've been waiting year for season two and they do this. I think on purpose. NEVER AGAIN!"
4,;0),"The truth was, Jan Folger had never really given Junior Busby a second thought--even though he'd lived next door to her for about a million years. But her charity group was holding a bachelor auction. They needed one more eligible man to put on the block...and she supposed Junior would just have to do.Then the local paper went and ran a photo of the fully grown Junior--wearing jeans and a five o'clock shadow--and suddenly it seemed like every woman in Byford, Indiana, wanted to know him better--a whole lot better. And Jan was starting to wonder if maybe she hadn't overlooked a hot property right there in her own neighborhood ...Oldies but goodies for me this was one of my favorite books growing up. Of course reading it today didn't have the same effect on me like back then but i still enjoyed that re reading moment not a bad book and i LOVE the title."
3,four dollars and 51 cents,"This book had a interesting plot & I loved that it was set in my home state. Loved the hero, hated the girl."
1,5 Minute Fun,I played this game on the PS2 and it was fun for about 5 minutes. I don't imagine it will be too much different for xbox. It got tiring so fast because you could love tap another vehicle and you would have wrecked and had to start at the same spot with a new car all the while your opponents are passing you at 120mph. This makes it seemingly impossible.
1,Sasa Lazic je Peder! Salim se,"This game is good as ice cream! You drive smash, drive, wreck the car, drive, drive fast! It has all that a gamer needs! I recommend it, and USE it!"
1,Worst Game Ever!!,"This is the worst game I have ever played! First of all I dont know what the point of the game is. Second of all the Grafics are terrible, i mean horrible. The cars were unpoportional and the over all grafics were BAD! I mean I have seen Nintendo 64 games that looked better then this! If You are looking for a Racing game for the X Box I fully recommend not to waste your money on this game because I Truly believe it is THE WORST GAME EVER!!"
3,"""Well, It's Not Wreckless...""","-Chad Steingraber--Paradigm/Infogrames--Level Designer/Game Designer/3D Artist on The Terminator: Dawn of Fate-I love racing/driving games, it is definately my favorite catagory..., unfortunately I get a specific game in my head and compare all other games to it. While playing Burnout, I found myself saying ""that's cool"" .....or ""I wish it could have been like 'this' instead of 'that'..."" throughout the game. It's not a bad game at all, it definately has the speed thing down....but there were bad points too. Graphic bugs like terrain popping in and out makes me not want to play (is that shallow? haha) the game. I like my driving games to be seemless...I like stuff to look pretty while I'm driving around....is that too much to ask? This is definately a rent/borrow game before you buy it, because you may not like it...or you may love it. Me, all I said was, ""Well, it's not Wreckless....."""
1,Not even stupid-cheesy funny,"I love cheesy horror movies, ala Troma Films, but this movie was just completely bad. There were about three parts that were actually chuckle worthy, but otherwise the absolutely terrible acting and overly stereotyped characters makes this movie completely unwatchable.I can honestly say I completely wasted my time watching this all the way through with only about 15 seconds worth of laughing. Save yourself that time and skip this movie and move on to some other cheesy horror that is actually good like Poultrygeist."
1,"Stupid, but not ""Good"" Stupid","There is nothing redeeming about this film. I love a good, campy horror flick as much as the next guy, but this movie makes me embarrassed to even say that. Not funny, not scary, not sincere, there is no point to watching this movie. You can't even watch it with friends and make fun of the filmmakers because apparently they ""intended"" it to be stupid and that's why its fun. Yeah, I don't think so."
5,"Amazing, hilarious","Not to be taken seriously, but seriously this is a hilarious, exciting, and scary low budget movie that looks like it was made in 30 days for $100k, but an article I read said it was made in 10 days for a couple thousand dollars or something like that. Amazing! Must own"
4,Overall a good book.,"I randomly came across this book while browsing memoirs here on Amazon and immediately added it to my wish list! The book took me a lot longer to read then i thought it would, because i was constantly falling in and out of love with it (so to speak.) There were parts in the book that (coming from a mothers point of view) just ripped me to pieces.. and made me want to read more and more... and other parts that made me want to put it down and leave it for a while. At some points as i moved forward in the book, i felt as if i were re-reading the previous chapters.. only every once in a whlie was something new and exciting added. Overall the book was great! It made me very thankful to be surrounded by such caring family and friends.. and have a roof over my head and food in my belly. The ending was abrupt.. but there's a sequel, that i have already added to my wish list."
2,boring and depressing,"I really would not reccommend this book to anyone. Although I did read all of it, I had to force myself to keep reading. It really is not enjoyable or interesting."
2,"An Irish Version of ""The Grapes of Wrath""","I was told this was a ""must read, "" but the more I read the more depressed I became. While I'm sure there was poverty in Ireland at that time, I felt that McCourt painted a picture that all men were alcoholic and unemployed. Although it was depressing, I couldn't put the book down. There was always a hope that ""it's got to get better, how could it get any worse."" I'd like to see what happened after he got back to America in a sequel."
2,Boring and uneventful,"I was really disappointed by this novel. Although the descriptive writing was very explicit , the story itself revealed very little. How often does the reader have to hear about the dirty jars and the coal? I felt ""ripped off"" by this book. After reading in such great detail about this man's poor, rotten childhood, I would have liked to know how it affected him later in life...what happened to this boy when he got to America?"
4,the strength of this book lies in it's simplicity,"angela's ashes is a brilliant book in that it does not over dramatise a life that was horrid in just the telling of it. i read a comment that it didn't have a plot. this is life, if you want a plot, watch Melrose !! I truly hope Mr McCourt writes another so we all know what happened to the family and the people that made up his childhood. The catholic church should be ashamed !"
5,Staggering.,"Words can not really describe my feelings as I was reading this autobiography. McCourt captures the experience of the Irish Catholic childhood with faultless accuracy. The guilt, the shame, the humiliation, the systematic and completely accepted abuse (both physical and emotional) of the Irish Catholic child, which begins from the day they are born, is faithfully portrayed. This book will make you laugh, cry and seethe with rage at the injustice of it all.For me it was a great source of comfort. Thank you Frank McCourt - how you survived you childhood is a miracle indeed."
5,Angela's Ashes,"Don't buy this audio book for your auto, unless you have plenty of gasoline and a lunch. My advice is that you turn off your cell phone and do not attempt to make any appointments or speak to anyone for the next 15 hours. Once you begin to hear this sorryful tale, you will never be the same. You may never stop driving for 15 hours. This book is a hazard to your well being and may damage your ability to be a good Irish father. If you are a little bit Irish, this will turn you sideways. Now, pardon me, I must have a stout and then go to confession. God bless you, Father."
5,"this book made me cry, laugh,,","i bought this book at the airport. this book made me laugh out loud,cry,and then laugh again. i bought a few more of this book and sent them to my friends in Korea."
4,What are you people reading?,"Frank McCourt's book Angela's Ashes was a MEMOIR. It was intended to be a truthful and vivid account of his REAL life. I thought it was wonderful, and I learned a lot about what life was like for indigent families in Ireland. Yes, the scenes were graphic and tragedies seemed endless, but it was VERY well-written. I think a lot of people didn't like the book, either because they were expecting a delicate, sugar-coated tale of his childhood or simply because the story forced them to evaluate how many things they took for granted in their own childhood. Guilt can be a terrible thing...Also, how can anyone say that there was too much sadness? This is an ACTUAL account of someone's life. I applaud Mr. McCourt at having shared his pain with his readers. For all of those who did not like this book, next time, pick up one of those predictable romance novels from the grocery store; leave the emotional truths and real-life stories to the rest of us."
5,Well written,"I believe this book splashed the name Frank McCourt onto the international writing scene. And I think he deserved it. I imagine there are millions of other stories much like his, and I can't imagine that it took this long for someone to tell it and gain such a massive audience. But McCourt is the one who told it and told it very well. Perhaps the best general word for the book is poignant. McCourt experienced such losses and challenges that he had to grow up long before his time. One senses that boyish struggle between wanting to just be a child and realizing that he had seen far too much of life to do that. I will not recount the crises and incidents that make up this life, but I will say that you will be moved profoundly by reading it. That is because there is heart and soul in this account."
4,Angela's Ashes,"yeah i read the book Angela's Ashes, in my college english class at my high school. I found it a very interesting book, it gave good detail, description, and the book was just a really good book in general. I'd really recommend this book if you are someone who likes a good and interesting book. The author did a very good job on the publication of the book; it really made me feel bad for Frankie the little boy."
4,Prize Potato,"I thought this was going to be a good read after all it won the Pulitzer Prize and every other person on the underground has been reading it. Don't get me wrong it was a good read, but what I didn't know was it would ruin my diet. I developed a strange craving for mashed potato and soft-boiled eggs, which are usually two of my least favourite foods. But did it make me want to revert to Catholicism? With all those Priests slamming doors - not a chance! I'll carry on practicing my Pagan beliefs and wish Frank McCourt well-healed shoes and all the boiled eggs and mashed potatoes he can eat."
5,great book for all ages,"Im only a sophomore in high school and i just finished this book. I absolutely love it. i recommend this book to everyone that can read, all ages will love it!"
2,So... Depressing!,"I must be the only person in America who does not like this book. I was only able to read about and half and 4 children died! Frank McCourt is a beautiful and honest writer, however, the tale is so grim I wasn't able to finish it. There were too many victims and too much sickness in this book for me to enjoy it."
2,Slow moving downer of a book,"Very slow read. I found it hard to get into because the same things kept happening to Frank, (hunger, drunk father, poor home life)but the only thing that changed was his age. Read it in my book club and none of us really liked it. We watched the movie and it was okay, but it skipped a lot of the story and the order of things that occurred in the book were not the same as in the movie. The movie gave the mother more of a voice and made the viewer want to feel sorry for the father-the book did the opposite. My opinion: don't bother with it."
2,ma's drunk and pa's crying,"chapter 1 pa's drunk and ma's crying and the little wee ones have soiled themselves. it's raining here in limerick. i.chapter 2 ma is sitting by the fireplace crying. so i go down to the pub and there is pa. he is drunk.chapter 3 so we go to america. tis a wonderful place. it might rain in limerick but it gets godawful cold in new york. and by the way, pa is drunk and ma is crying by the fire and the little wee ones have bees knees and thrushes ankles before them on the supper plate. i."
4,A simply human book,"This is the type of book which no film can capture the atmposphere of - a truly sad yet funny story at the same time. I tried to read it twice - the first time i just read the lines ""... worse still is the miserable Irish childhood"" and didn't really give the book much of a chance. Then my friend encouraged me to read it as she said it was funny and so I decided to give it another chance.I started laughing on the second page in - it was fantastic. I feel the film gives it little justice - as though the book is sad - it deals with survival and humour rather than just sadness. It captures the attention through telling it's story through the eyes of a child - a truly entertaining, human yet funny book."
4,Gripping tale of poverty.,"I found the book powerful and moving. I was unable to put it down. However, I was left with some unsettled feelings. What did Mr. McCourt learn from his early experiences? At the books end, he was heading down the same destructive path as his father. At what point did he change? Why? At times his story was repetative, especially his father's drunkeness, Angela's weakness and Frank's own early sexual exploits. I found the ending particularly disturbing. He finally arrives in America, land of hope, and sleeps with a married stranger. All that said, I would still recommend it to others and look forward to the sequel. Maybe my questions will be answered then."
5,Powerful and unforgettable,This book had a profound effect on me. I certainly found parts of it difficult to read through and there were several times I had to put the book down because it was too overwhelmingly sad. I wouldn't recommend reading this book while eating either. I was so moved by the author's unapologetic straighforwardness. He told of a miserable childhood but there was very little self pity I thought. I can't wait to see the movie to see if it compares.
5,One of the best books I have ever read...,"I was sitting on a plane when I finished reading Angela's Ashes, and even then I couldn't put the book down. I literally sat and stared at the cover for about 10 minutes - at which point the lady sitting next to me spoke for the first time and said "" You look really sad to have finished that book!"". It is a truly brilliant book - I experienced so many emotions whilst reading it - not least of which was admiration at the way someone who lived such a trying life managed to maintain a sense of humour. I was so disappointed that the book ended when Frank got to America. I wondered for days about what happened next."
5,Incredible gifted talent for story telling; gripping,"I love to read, but rarely does a book have such an enormous impact on me. Frank McCourt's vivid and guileless present-tense story telling style brought all the characters right into my heart and there they will stay. One of the best books I have ever read, by far."
3,A male chauvinist from Irish trash,"I resented Frankie for worshipping his father who neglected the children, caring not whether they lived or died (except maybe for his daughter), then rudely scolding his mother for having an affair with another man after the father inevitably left them for good. Was Angela supposed to be the Martyed Madonna forever? How dare Frankie judge her?! From the look of the reviews, it seems people are addicted to stories of grossness, degradation and excrement-ridden lives. I am utterly disappointed. Where is the story of the respectable, poor Irish family? Is there one?"
4,worth the time to read,"Although I felt like things were bogging down about half way thru, I did finish the book. A friedn who reads tons of novels couldn't finish it, which surprised me. McCourt tells a tale of deprivation and sadness, but not in a maudlin fashion. He manages to salvage some humor from whatever situation he recounts."
4,I Kissed the Blarney Stone,"It's been said that the English made the Irish speak English and the Irish taught the English how to write it. McCourt continues this gift for sure. In fact he stretches the reader's belief in some of his tales, especially in the stories about Theresa Carmody and Mrs Finucane. Sad to say, at the end, Mccourt has not been able to overcome his bitterness."
3,"In the end, a disappointment.","When I first began this book, I quickly became absorbed in the story, and found it very moving. Later, I found the repeated mention of the author's sexual discoveries disturbing, and the end was a complete disappointment to me. I found myself sitting with my jaw to the floor, questioning the point of the book."
2,"The good, the bad and the ugly; mostly ugly!!!","This could have been a fascinating story if the prose had been cleaned up a bit. Also when refencing family members in general and his mother in particular, Mr.McCourt was quite indelicate and defamatory in his discription of certain actions which should not have been included in the narrative. His own sins of the flesh were of no interest to me and he should feel shame and dishonor for disclosing them to the world. I am aware of the poverty during the depression and I had known many Irish American families during that trying time having become buddies with their sons and I can definitely say,no matter their poverty, personal hygien, in so far as the times and circumstances would allow, was never wanting. Mr. McCourt should have been more circumspect. He will make millions from this book but he should also feel quite uneasy!!"
3,Over-rated,"I expected this book to be one of those that I would not want to put down. Instead, it was one of those that I could not wait to finish just to say it is over. I thought that the author belabored his trails and tribulations to the point of no return. At least, I'd never return to reading this book again. It is a depiction of the life and times of an Irish family coping with unbelievable hardships. However, by the end of the novel, the 'hero' seems to have fallen almost as far as his father - stealing, consorting with lowlifes, etc. And, to me, the worst thing he did was to turn his back on his family. People who grew up with hard times and hardships usually tend to help their own when and if they make it. He didn't seem to worry about helping anyone but himself when he made it. Another reviewer said to those who thought this a great book -- read more! I second this thought -- read any great piece of literature and this will pale in comparison."
5,You can be no closer without being IN the book,"This intimate view into the lives of the impoverished Irish in the early 1900's transports you instantly where the foremost concern is the next meal. Yet in the face of daily struggles to fulfill this most basic need, Frank McCourt writes with a nakedness to the soul where independence, pride and interpersonal struggles abound. In the spirit of striving for a better life, Frank Mccourt struggles with his father's dependence on alcohol and his mother's co-dependency in a time much changed than our own. The story's end comes quickly, but fortunately, there is more in his next tale."
5,Brilliant!,"How could anyone not fall in love with this book? I have never read a book that had me laughing out loud and crying tears in the same sitting. Surely, the most effective (and clever) use of the run-on sentence in literary history!"
5,"Remarkable, perfect, wonderful","Frank McCourt has created a wonderful, warm and witty memoir out of a life that could have justifiably and easily been turned into a miasma of self-pity, depression and angst. His humor and sensitive insights coupled with stunning use of dialect lift this book way above the level most memoirs. McCourt's also got a keen sense of perspective about him, not letting hindsight and the obscuring lens of maturity bog down the childhood years."
2,Better heard than read.,"I bought Angela's Ashes after hearing Frank McCourt read from it on the radio. Over the radio, it was like the bedtime story you hoped would never end. This is because McCourt is the consummate Irish story teller.Unfortunately, in print, the same story is bleak and largely devoid of the magic Frank McCourt brings to it in the telling. So, if you haven't read Angela's Ashes yet, see if it is available on tape. If so, buy it and save yourself the unpleasantness of encountering this trying story without Frank McCourt as your personal guide. It's like the difference between canned asparagus and fresh."
2,as engaging as a debutante's hangnail,"A Pulitzer???! Was the prize committee out getting pie-eyed with Frank's father when they came up with this one?This book was readable, but it sure took a lot of effort. I tried but couldn't empathize with the characters, and I certainly wouldn't say the writing was inspiring. However, I must admit that I did smile once.Maybe it's better the second time around after a few Guinness'."
2,"well written, but depresssssssing.","I kept hoping SOMETHING good would happen for little Frank, but to no avail. Just one sad, depressing moment after another. I do however, have endless admiration for the author's rise from this mess to being a successful author. It proves a horrible childhood can be overcome."
5,Insightful Book of a man's life growing up in Ireland,"People who are more interested to know what life was like in the Ireland Frank McCourt grew up in shall gain insight. Here we have a very human book, it is not Ireland full of leprechauns and shamrocks, it is the story of a very hard childhood. It is not pretty and glossy, it is real, full of honesty. What I liked so much about this book was I felt it exposed so honestly what it is to be human, not perfect,striving in this world to have a better life. Frank McCourt weaves you right into the memories he shares so vividly. I would have to imagine that in writing this book, it must have been theraputic & clarifying for him.This is not a light, jaunty little book, it is painful,touching,many times injected with humor and fascinating peak into an early life full of struggle.It is extremely well-written! Thanks Frank for the"
5,"Make that 10..Maybe the best story I've ever read, or heard.","Anglelas Ashes was my first attempt at listening to a book on tape, and I was totally blown away by McCourt's story, as well as his style. I'm almost embarrased to admit that in less than a year, I've listened to the story at least half a dozen times - I kid you not! He has even inspired me to attempt writing myself. I have eagerly awaited his new book, which was released in stores this week. Trust me, if you want a truley remarkable listening experience - LISTEN to Angela's Ashes. TJD,Seattle"
4,Great Irish read,"I laughed and cried when I read this book. He really hit it true. It reminded me a lot of a collection of haunting short stories by Ross Brinn, called ""To The Woods and Waters Wild"" after a line from a Yeats poem. Check it out at Amazon. Keep them coming! Erin go bragh."
4,A tale of misery overcome by innocent hope.,"The woe of a childhood so incredibly dysfunctional yet expertly brought to life by McCourt makes Angela's Ashes a compelling read. I can't wait for ""'Tis""."
5,Sad--Beautiful--Compelling,Tears were streaming down my face after the first chapter. Every Irishman and Non-irishmen alike must read this book.....and all the McCourts.
5,This book was fantastic!,A must read for anyone who feels their own life is tough. This book puts life in perspective and has the ability to thank everyday for what you have. Very compelling. A fantastic read.
4,I had a love-hate relationship with the book!,"McCourt's childhood was filled with poverty, neglect, and heartbreak. How much of this was caused by ignorant parents who were unable to deal with raising their children, but did not cease to continue producing them. No matter what time period it is- religion and ignorance should never be an excuse for child abuse and neglectBravo to McCourt-he is a more forgiving soul than I. His choppy writing style was soon forgotten, after a few chapters."
5,"ONE OF THE FUNNIEST, DEPRESSING BOOKS I'VE EVER READ","More has been said of this book than any I can think of in recent memory, so let me just say this....it's all true. This is one of those books that you won't be able to put down. I don't care how tough you are, if you don't find yourself crying at some point while reading 'Angela's Ashes,' you have no soul"
2,Disappointing but I'm not Irish,"I really wanted to enjoy this book based on the high praise it has, almost universally, received. But I found it difficult to read, given both the subject and, more importantly, the narrative voice. That voice might have appealed to me in a short story but wore thin over 60 pages, when I gave up. That's the point at which I realised the style wasn't going to change as Frank grew up--he wasn't just speaking in the voice of a child. I skimmed forward over the rest, which seemed to drone on.But then, I've never appreciated Ulysses either"
5,A Masterpeice To The End,"Frank McCourt displayed the truths of harsh poverty through a child's eyes. I didn't know when to laugh or to cry! He satirizes many things because he doesn't know better being a child. The McCourt family were very poor and many times, their childrens' hunger was so much that they died from it. I am still amazed that four children lasted through that childhood. This book is a realistic depiction of life in Ireland in the time of war and it kept me very amused. I never wanted to put it down."
4,A Depressing but powerful book.,Angela's Ashes was a book that I really enjoyed. This book helped me understand how hard life was during the years of the depression. Frank McCourts style of writing captured my attention on the first page and kept me reading till the end to learn more about the harsh life he experienced. This book for the most part is depressing but there are moments when you will laugh with Frankie. This book also gives the reader a sense of hope. Through the hard times there is always hope. This is a powerful book that conveys deep message of poverty and hope.
4,Angela's Ashes,"This book was a moving work of literature. It showed the hardships that the Irish had to go through. Frank made me feel as if I was there experiencing these hardships. From a heartless father to a sacrificing motheer who would give up her life to provide food for her family, Frank McCourt paints a vivid picture of what life for an Irish Catholic was really like."
4,This memoir left me with a greater understanding of humanity,"Frank McCourt's story of growing up in poverty touched me deeply. I read this book through and later sat back and thought about how hard his life was. Yet, McCourt never makes the reader ""feel his pain"". Instead, a reader comes away laughing and crying at the unbelievable situations the McCourts found themselves in. I highly recommend this book!"
3,McCourt let us down and left us hanging,"I was totally engrossed with this book until Frankie began hauling coal. The characters were alive on the pages. I could visualize the squalor, smell the stench, sense the hopelessness. The bittersweet humor tugged at my heartstrings. I was telling all my friends and family to read this book. Then suddenly Frankie reaches puberty, boinks the American tart, and reaches America. What happened?? Deadline? Sequel offer? Movie deal? C'mon, Mr. McCourt, it is obvious you can do better."
2,not impressed by the pulitzer prize anymore,"At the beginning of this book, I would have given it 5 stars but as I read on all it talked about was his sex life, his interffering ( masturbating) with his self and him commiting adultry his first night in america, even though he was so outraged that his mother had done the same with laman and he slapped her for it.All he spoke of was helping his family but instead he stole money from a dead woman and came to america. He could have stayed and worked and helped his poor toothless mother and his brothers but he came here and we never find out what happened to his mother, nor his brothers.If this kind of trash wins the pulitzer prize , then ill never read another pulitzer prize winning book ever again.I was disgusted by the book at the end . Im gald I only paid 99 cents for it. but hate I helped to support such a mans life style."
3,Angela's Ashes,"Angela's Ashes was not my favorite book at all. it was interesting in some points of the book, but there was too much ""stuff"" that just didn't need to be there. it would get really interesting and then he would talk for two or three pages about a lot of things that i didn't even need to know. it kind of made me upset that everytime she had a kid, one would die. after the third child, it really got old.it took me a long time to read it too. i wouldn't recomend this book for anyone who doesn't like to read a long book."
1,Bad.,This book offers no real story except that the author grew up poor and did terrible things while he was young. It is a waste of time and money. My son had to read it in an English class and I was sorry that he did. It is not a book for young people or anyone else.What is really sad is that it has won any awards at all.
2,Utterly Baffled at All the Praise,"After 52 pages, I had to stop reading. My free time is too precious. And I feel terrible about the money spent -- I now have a renewed commitment to use the library.If you want to read an intelligent, compelling memoir I'd highly recommend Jill Ker Conway's ""The Road from Coorain."" And an absolutely incredible book about diaries and memoirs is Alexandra Johnson's ""The Hidden Writer."" Another great memoir is Kathleen Norris's ""The Cloister Walk."" These are just a few that come to mind."
2,Well written but boring,"I found this to be a well written book but hopelessly boring. Just when you think his life couldn't have been any worse as a child, things got worse. There was no end to it. I pushed through to the end and was dissatisified with the hollow feeling this book left me with.Again, if a depressing book with little plot variation interests you I would recommend this one because McCourt turned out a quality product. I just need a little more variety in the plot to satisfy me."
2,"sad, sad story","I love the way this author writes but felt depressed reading his book Angela's Ashes. That his father was such a drunk, was more than unjust to his family. I can't imagine what it would be like to endure the kind of life Frank lived as a child. What sticks out mostly in my mind, is the part where the mother started to remove the wooden trim in the apartment and use if for firewood because they were so poor and cold. What I do not agree with, is that this author tells this story as if his mother was some kind of hero. She was lazy and one of the most horrible mothers I have ever heard of. Nothing heroic about that woman. She had no backbone even to the point where she would let her own kids starve to death. If you can read a story like this one, without getting depressed then I say go for it. Otherwise skip this one."
1,It stunk.,"If this was my life I would be embarassed and certainly not put it all in a memoir. I would not recomend it to anyone. I don't care what the New York Times said, I think the book stunk."
1,So why all the fuss?,"After reading this book, I am at a complete loss as to why this book has won the awards, critical praise, and popular attention that it has. I found it unrelentingly grim, with little in the writing style, characters, or plot to make it worthwhile. The descriptions of events were telegraphic and concrete, with little psychological nuance or depth. Normally, a book about such dismal topics would leave one sad and moved; this book left me cold."
1,Quick! Get him some Prozac!,I was reminded of the old joke that obituaries are the Irish comic strips! I doubt I have ever seen a more tragic book.I hope to heaven no one judges Catholicism by this miserable example. As a lifelong Catholic... I never was more grateful that my parents were from Italy rather than Ireland.
1,A Real Sleeper,"It appears that I am of the minority when I say this book was awful! I forced myself to read the entire thing eventhough I found I could only read a few pages at a time before I fell asleep entirely. Only after 200 pages of repetitive storyline, drunk unemployable father, death, depression, did this book actually begin to get better. I enjoyed the last 100 pages when Frank seemed to begin getting his life together. Wish I had spent my time reading something else."
3,Angela's ashes,This book is about poverty with a very poor family in irland and the book takes you through a bunch of things that the family endures in their life so if you are into reading about these things this is a book for you.
4,A book for everyone,"If you can appreciate one of the most brilliantly written stories of the 20th century, you will like this book. If you have ever laughed, ever cried, you will like this book."
5,Rufis!,"Well, comming from a 15 year old, you may not think that I know good books, but obviously I have good taste. This book taught me a lot about the compelling strength the Irish have about their Catholic fatih, being Catholic, I have learned a lot. You laugh, you cry, frankly, you become Frankie McCourt. I loved the book, and it makes me want to see the movie and read the sequel. This is in my required reading for my Honors English Class . If it is yours, or if you want to read it for kicks, READ it! You'll gain the knowledge you're supposed to."
2,"Sad, depressing, funny, and realistic.",This book simply touches the deepest cores of our humanity... Its rich in feelings and makes us reflect on ou ownr childhood...
3,"Enjoyable, though a bit redundant","Angela's could easily become one of the best autobiography that I have ever read, but having read Wild Swans by Jung Chang before, make Angela Ash a bit inferior. Can you recall, how many time did Mr. Mc Court told about he and Malacy was forced to sing and die for Ireland? In the end, the story really make me feel about the struggle and humiliation of living under poverty."
5,HOW TO LAUGH AND CRY AT THE SAME TIME,"Wonderfully moving book that makes you finally appreciate the old line ""there is always someone worse of than yourself"". Which McCourt proves as whilst relaying his own dire curcumstances he can still point out others who were in sorrier shape. A tragic comedy that highlights how adaptable and resilient the human spirit is. I couldn't put it down and literally found myself laughing through the tears."
2,You must be Irish to appreciate this book.,"I gave up after the first couple chapters. The Irish twang was annoying, the story was BORING! I bought the book because it was The Strand's (bookstore in Manhattan) number one seller, plus a Pulitzer winner, so I figured I'd give it a try. I still don't undertand what all the hype was about. I guess if you were dirt poor and Irish at one time, then you could relate-but I got NOTHING from this book-not even an entertaining read."
2,What? How Did that End?,"This book was great right up until the last few pages and then...WHAT? After that horrible childhood of poverty, he did WHAT? He steals money from a dead woman and gets HIMSELF out of poverty, leaving everyone else behind without so much as a fare-thee-well, has a tawdry fling with some low-lifes and decides that he has finally arrived? Didn't he learn anything at all from his mother's struggles? Shame on the author for telling tales that reflect so poorly on himself and, by extension, on the mother that raised him!"
2,"AN EDSEL...Lots of hype, no delivery.","Angela's Ashes didn't do much for me, except makeme wish I hadn't spent the money on it. At first,the run-on, breathless telling of the story -- as achild would do -- was refreshing and engaging.But it got old very fast. Largely a disappointment."
4,Great Reading,"I read this book while recently travelling overseas.... there was nothing else around that was written in English! I found it interesting and amusing - sad at times, but not depressing. I especially enjoyed the style of writing, and found it anything but boring. Whenever I had a few minutes, I would pick up the book for another glimpse into Frank's life...... perfect way to pass the time between business meetings! I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a humorous, ""lite"" autobiography - nothing too deep or mysterious, just day-to-day life through the eyes of a child."
4,The Ashes of Sorrow,"This is a very sad story of a Catholic child raised by a drunken father and a depressed mother. It was a very good book, that taught me to be grateful for the parents that I have. Frank McCourt captured the story perfectly through the eyes of a child/young adult. In the book, he describes things as though he wrote it just as it happened. If you like looking through the eyes of,or pretending to be people, this is a book is for you. I you don't want to follow the crazy life of an Irish, Catholic kid, then you don't want to read this."
4,"MacCourt, from Joyce and Faulkner","Angela ashes:a memoir, continues the great literary tradition of Joyce and Faulkner"
5,When you begin to read it you can't stop,"I just wanted a good book for a rainy sunday afternoon and with ""Angela's Ashes"" I also spend the night.This book influenced me emotional very much and I had to think about it for a long time.This book is definately a great book with a great story-a real story .I often compared Frank Mc Courts childhood with mine and I am very happy to had a wonderful childhood without too many sorrows"
2,I was disappointed,"The first l/2 of the book was excellent, the second l/2 was not. He made me feel his pain in the first l/2 then lost track of what was important in the second l/2. I wanted to know how he over-came his diversities, instead he told me much more than I EVER wanted to know about his private life. I guess laughs on me if I want to know the details of how Mr. McCourt finally made it I'll have to buy the next book!! I think I'll wait for the movie. Final grade ""D"""
4,An Irish diamond,"Having listened to Malachy McCourt for many years on WBAI, I feel like I know Frank McCourt. After reading this book I feel like I lived with him. This book could have been very depressing if not written with such humor and childhood innocence. This book will help you appreciate everything you have. It also helped me truly understand my Irish heritage as well as my Irish father."
5,A good dose of reality,"Superb book. Tears at your heart, and makes you want to scream and laugh all at the same time. A very good reminder to show compassion for those less fortunate."
4,Extraordinary Story,I wa amazed. While reading this memoir of Frank McCourt the reader is brought into a world of heartbreaking issues and how one family dealt with their poverty and demons. It amazes me that Frank and his brother were able to blossom in the dark lives they led. I am excited about the sequel he is working on and can't wait to get my hands on it.
4,Angela's Ashes comes alive from Frank McCourt's voice.,"I usually ""read"" a book, rather than ""listen"" to it, however, I was offered the audio version from my sister-in-law and accepted it and I am glad I did!!! I loved the book and I think that having McCourt tell it to you adds another dimension to the story. I really don't think I would have gotten as much out of it, had I read it. McCourt really ""tells"" the story to you and I enjoyed it very much."
2,Angela's Ashes,"I read the book. It is moving and sad, but I don't understand how the author won a Pulitzer Prize for it. It was difficult to wade through the first four chapters. It got easier, but only because I made up what I thought the dialog meant. You can't look in the dictionary for the meaning of many words used in the text. If I were Irish, born in the 1930's, I could probably appreciate the book much more. It is a rambling account of a poor Irish family... very sad... but??"
1,Did I miss something?,"When narrative style like this starts earning the Pulitzer Prize, I think I may begin to submit some of my high school students' creative writing."
1,not as good as everyone says,I read this book for my book club and it was a difficult and slow book to get through. Several of us in the club were not impressed. His life was very difficult and I didn't enjoy reading about all the tragedy and obstacles he faced. I never felt like their was a light at the end of the tunnel for him or this book.
1,0 out of 5 stars,"Looking at the endless series of 5 out of 5 star reviews makes me think this world is doomed.Everyone deserves a chance to earn a few dollars....Now the author of this book has had his, let's leave it at that. The man has passed the hat and wants for nothing; in fact, he still has his day job.A hollow echo of Irish life that harkens back more to Darby O Gill and the Little People than to anything real. The dialog is hollow and inane, the story line serves up one cliched scene after another. A thorough waste of time. No stars, not even a barren asteroid.Forget this book."
1,Mc Courts book - the final word,"Anyone from Limerick who was listening to the local station last night or anybody listening to it on the internet would have heard Richard Harris, a contemporary of Frank Mc Court point out the inaccuracies in this book. Harris says that there was no misery because of the sense of community that surrounded and still surrounds the city of Limerick. Also it appears that Angela's ashes were lost by Malchy Mc Court on an Icelandic flight and are still probably in the lost luggage department of Kennedy airport. As to the book itself, I believe along with most of Limerick, Richard Harris and even Brian Friel has said that this book lacks any literary merit whatsoever.Angela Mc Court was often described as the angel of the lanes and was a big heavy woman and not a waif like Emily Watson thogh Frank Mc Court himself said it brought a tear to his eye how much she reminded him of his mother.Don't buy this book if you want a good read. Buy it if you want a good fire."
1,Very disappointed,"I expected a great read...but was truly disappointed. Perhaps it is just me, but life is hard enough, I read for entertainment and this book was NOT entertaining. It was truly depressing and not inspirationsal. Do we all need to write about the sad times of our childhood to get a Pulitzer? Although I have read other stories of sad childhoods that have inspired me (such as ""Alicia""), this one did not. Sorry..."
1,Why Did This Get The Prize?,"If you enjoy misery and abuse of others as escapism for yourself,then this is your book.Don't think you'll gain many insights into Irish culture here.....if these people are even real or truthful they are way outside normal life.So what's to be learned from that? How many times can you read that Dad spent all the dole money at the pub while the kids went hungry....before it loses it's meaning? For me there's nothing here,especially since this same story has been told thousands of times before. If you like watching the Christians and the lions go at it then get this book."
1,Leaves a bad taste in my mouth,"Yuck, yuck and double yuck. After having seen the movie trailer while in the middle of reading Angela's Ashes, I stand amazed that this book has drawn such an avid audience (and no doubt the movie will too). The author spends so much time with graphic descriptions of hunger, poverty, disease and filth, but character development, growth, or even self-reflection barely surfaces in this book. I kept reading just to see who was going to die next. As for humor, maybe McCourt's reading on audio makes it funny, but the droll tongue-in-cheek humor that is often based on mockery and ignorance didn't even make me smile. At the end, turning to thievery and adultery could have even been a bit ironic, but in the drab context of his endless laundry list of ""this happened, then this happened"", it barely registers in this novel. Save your money. Save your time."
1,My eyes glazed over,"This book is unbelievably bad. The story is repetitive and the writing is horrendous. I suffered through the first 50 pages and finally said ""enough!"""
5,wow,i can honestly say that this is the best book i have ever read. it has the perfect mixture of comedy and and tragedy.i highly recommend this book.
5,The best piece of literature I've ever come across,"Angela's Ashes was so amazing i dont kno where to start. This memoir was beautifully written. I laughed with Frank, and cried for him. Unfortunatly after reading this book i stopped reading in general because i was unable to find anything topping Angela's Ashes. This is a must read for all mature readers."
5,OK - Here is another 5 star vote.,Rarely do I read a book that holds me to the end like Angela's Ashes. I read a lot of the popular bestseller prizewinning fiction and this one is one of the best. Add my 5 stars to the overall rating. It deserves it.
3,It ain't really Limerick....,"I was born and raised in Limerick and lived there until I was 27, as was my Father. Limerick may not be Paris but neither is it what the author describes it as. Yes there was and probably still is poverty but Limerick is a relatively modern and progressive city with mostly middle class residents who work in the electronics sector. My Father lived near Limerick during the same period as the author and did not come from a wealthy family and had tough times, including the death of 2 siblings, but also many more good times and fondly remembers his youth. He worked hard in the city and finally moved to one of the 'big houses on the Ennis Road'. Limerick and the surrounding region has much to offer and should not be judged by authors skewed memories..."
4,"McCourts ""miserable Irish Catholic Childhood""","Angela's Ashes is a touching portayel of McCourts ""miserable Irish Catholic Childhood"". It is the sad story of growing poor in Ireland. McCourt overcomes his father leaving him, starving, and constantly being in the hospital for illness. McCourt is a vivid writer and describes his childhood graphically. Overall a good book with many memorable moments."
4,WHY you should read this book,"All of these reviews talk about either ""It touched me"" or ""It was a waste of time."" I just finished this book and i would recommend it to anyone. This book is more than a story, it is an experience. Even if you are not interested in this book or even if you read this and you do not enjoy it, you are guarenteed to gain something from reading this. It opens up a door of reality that would otherwise be closed to us. Sure it has some weak areas, as all books do, but the compassion you feel for this family overwhelming. I dont understand how you can rate a person's life, it is only a best seller if you dont just read it, but you try to understand it and put yourself it the characters positions. Even if you dislike this book and you read it, if nothing less, you become a more well-rounded person."
4,great story,this is a great story. frank mccourt is one of the best writers for the new century. his words and the way he captured the feelings and emotions of the time was wonderful. this story is a great inspiration and wonderful story for anyone.
5,Frank McCourt,"Angela's Ashes is a true story about a boy named Frank McCourt. The story is about his life in Ireland and America. Words can't describe how much pain and poverty Frank's family suffered. It's amazing and wonderful that Frank is still alive to tell it. This book is sad, but also funny. Frank has to watch three of his siblings die, but also is able to watch three of them grow up. His father leaves him, his mother, and brothers without any money. Luckily Franks old enough to get a job. This book tells how him and his family manages with their misfortunes. I really liked this book because it makes you grateful for what you have."
4,An (emotionally) tough but excellent read,"Many times as I was reading this book, I wanted to put it down. Angela's Ashes is not a happy story. In fact, the abject poverty, squalor, desperation and death make it downright depressing. But it is masterfully told. McCourt's first person writing style is real, genuine and so you feel along with the protagonist: abandonment, disappointment, shame, grief, anger, betrayal but also hope and joy and pleasure in the simplest things. The turning point is when Frank finally decides to forget about his father, a drunk who abandons his family, and become a man. The story becomes more poignant as we watch Frank struggle to transform himself. As the story ends, though, the reader gets a sense that life is going to be better (the protagonist finally makes it back to America after scrimping and scrounging and working his ""arse"" off to pay the fare. He feels in America he'll be able to do great things and the reader hopes so much that ""'tis"".*"
5,Wow,"I just finished the book not more than 3 hours ago. I am deffinately not a reader, but decided to start on one of my Christmas presents anyways. I am so impressed and inspired by this book, surely the greatest that I have ever read. When I got done with it was the first time in 3 days that I have put it down. I can't wait to run to the bookstore and continue the story with 'Tis."
5,a great read!,although i question the total recall of a 3 year old; frank mccourt's memoir is one of the best reads i've had in a long time. his writing style is through a child's mind and very captivating. unbearable misery and uncontollable laughter throughout. an emotional rollercoaster. however i believe mccourt's account is one of a very very small percentage of people in ireland in the 30s & should not been viewed as a statement of ireland or the irish on the whole. but they're his memories and he tells them with cathartic genius.
2,I don't see what all the hype is about. . .,"This was definitely one of the most over-rated books I've read in years. It was a struggle to read it all the way through. Each and every day of his childhood seems to be exactly the same. He was hungry, Mom isn't much help, dad spends the food money for booze. Next day: He's hungry, mom isn't much help, dad spends the food money on booze. Next day: He's hungry, mom isn't much help, dad spends the food money on booze. It was far too long with little or no variety. Like many previous Pulitzer winning books -- it was a disappointment"
2,I'd rather have root canal than finish this book !!!!,"Reading this book was an agonizing ordeal. Yes, McCourt writes relatively well and his descriptions of his childhood experiences help the reader to vicariously experience 1/10 of his childhood sorrows. But Please,why oh why, did he have to drone on for almost 400 pages about snotty noses,his drunken father's alcoholic debauchery,yellow crude in his eyes, eating pigs heads.........A synopsis of his book should state, ""today was miserable, tomorrow was miserable, and hey,guess what ?, the next day was miserable too!&quot"
2,Wanted to give one and one-half stars,"This book is overrated and makes me wonder how McCourt got all those glowing reviews. My book club read this and most of us gave it less than one star. ""Disappointing"" was the word I heard the most as we discussed it. It was very hard to get through as far as I am concerned. The writing is not that great and it is boring and repetitive. All I could think was ""When will this be over and when can I get through this so I can go on to a good book?"" I got my copy from the library and couldn't get it back there fast enough."
5,"Bitingly funny, sardonically poignant","Frank McCourt's coming of age memoir, Angela's Ashes, is a richly textured, finely crafted work that makes life in anything but an Irish household seem bland. The harsh, unblinking depictions of his ineffective, preoccupied and exasperated mother; alcoholic, irresponsible but kind-hearted father; and the sharp, unflinching attidudes of a vast parade of other family characters all set against the cold, stand-offish backdrop of Ireland explained for me why the book received such stunningly negative reviews from members of my own family -- It was too close to their experiences growing up Irish and poor in the states. This book is true gem; It shows, unappologetically, that ugliness has a beauty that prettiness will never possess."
4,A riveting account of a true triumph of the human spirit.,"The story of McCourt's desperate childhood has a two-fold effect. It is chilling and heart-breaking in its harsh reality, but at the same time, his simple, local-dialect delivery, makes these characters come alive. You are fascinated by them. You need to know what happens. You care."
3,too depressing to be true,"I read the book, and the harrowing experiences of the author at times seem too depressing to stand an inch in the truth, tending to be more like a tv soap opera script that just could not see the light of day."
4,miserably depressing with a twist,"While this book details the Ireland we are all familiar with...poverty, war, alcohol...Frank McCourt defines every humorous memory which brightens the scene. I admit I wasn't drawn to this book like some good stories. It began very slowly and every member of his family seemed to be dying left and right. However, once I got to the final 150 pages (Frank's teen years), I couldn't put it down.It is disturbing how much control religion has over one's mind; however, seen through the eyes of a child it is entertaining.Don't expect a close-knit family when you sit down to read this. This is not a family that sticks together. Aside from his father, McCourt's aunt and grandmother are ""tight"" even when they have a little to spare. However, those in the lane who have less always seem to come through for others in the town which is enlightening.I am still debating whether I want to read the sequel, 'Tis."
5,Real world drama - excellent book. Not for the sensitive..,"If you enjoy a book that peeks into the lives and hardships of others without over-glorifying the content (though how he manages to remember his life in such great, descriptive detail is incredible) - and you can sit through the tragedy and squalor that mark this book, page after page, Angela's Ashes is an excellent choice.Frank McCourt lived (remarkably) to tell the story of his impoverished and tragedy-striken family who's hardships followed them from Ireland to New York and back again - unrelenting, and unforgiving. His detail is both intriguing and disturbing - his story memorable and his style brilliant. Highly recommended."
4,"Sad, insightful, wonderful story",...Boy am I glad I got this book - it is a real treasure. This book tells a great story and is really interesting (though also very depressing). Highly recommended.
4,:o),"Angela's Ashes is a very powerful and great book. It is hard in the beginning because it just seems hopeless and so depressing, and yet at the same time, you can't put it down. As it progresses u slowly become slightly numbed to this depression because you come to accept it is there way of life at the time and can find some of their experiences now comical. I enjoyed the book and would recommend it ."
3,"Fond rememberances, bitterness, and redundancy","McCourt's style instantly sucked me in, helping me to see again the world from more innocent eyes. It was very touching to see his portrayal of the resilience of children's souls. But when those souls slowly grow older, and recognize things for what they truly are, you are also reminded that those souls struggle to escape the world in which they are born. While much more realistic than a story in which the child grows up to earn billions or win a world reknowned award, the final third of the novel is flat and unrewarding. If the book were to teach me something, it would be that I could quit my life and somehow still manage to get by. Never once would it teach me to stand up for myself."
5,Fascinating and Entertaining,"Based on sheer enjoyment, this is a wonderful book to read. After almost every paragraph, I had a comment I wanted to share or a question I wanted to ask. This book opened the worlds of poverty, Irish culture, and Catholicism as I had never experienced them before. As a complete package, the book was not perfect, though. I found the opening pages confusing, since the events described are not in chronological order. However, the background information included in them is vital to the story. The reader must remember the events and connect them as the plot unfolds. I have often wondered what the world looks like through other people's eyes, and Frank McCourt gave me a complete tour of his world. Since Mr. McCourt won the Pulitzer Prize for Angela's Ashes, I know he became a successful adult. I look forward to a continuation of his story."
4,Can a memoir be selfish?,"The writing attracted me. A common thread of inventive, simple prose runs throughout the book giving art to an interesting story. Ferrol Sams's fiction is somewhat like this. I got a little tired of the ""self"" focus, and found myself more interested in what happened to Michael and Angela, and even the absent father after Frank left. Can a memoir be selfish?"
5,Why even rich kids can identify with Frank McCourt,"I'd give the book a 10 but those poems and songs of which we had to read all the choruses repeatedly weren't THAT great. Lacing the unimaginable and sickening poverty and disease anecdotes were memorable renditions of speeches and offhand comments made by adults to the McCourt children the like of which one rarely hears today from educated, sensitivity-trained and psychologically- oriented people, but which were all too common in ALL social strata until the recent past. These comments, directly and obliquely derogatory of the McCourt children and parents alike, must have scarred those children like the cold and malnutrition, and these are wounds any middle-aged person with a clear memory of his or her own chidhood can surely feel"
5,Most captivating book I have read in quite some time,"I was so caught up in Frank's life. As I read, I began to block out everything and everyone around me. I found it impossible to think of anything else in my life until I had finished.I only hope Mr. Mccourt writes a sequel. I would very much like to know what happened to all his family members , as well as his next step in life"
4,Keep Writing Frank McCourt,Great Literature. It was really direct with a child's point of view. The end took away from the book a little but it was still good! I'm 13 years old.
5,"Right up there with ""The Grapes of Wrath""",I absolutely love this book. It picks you up and sets you back down in a whole different place and time. It makes you grateful that you are lucky enough to be in the US in the '90's.
4,A Great Read,"I really liked the book, and read it twice. I think that late Mc Court was a great writer which he proved in his masterpiece Angela's Ashes.0000"
5,Fantastic deal!,I was able to buy this wonderful book for only one penny. It cant get much better than that. The book came to me in perfect condition!
4,Yes! You should read this one!,"Don't worry- it will go so quickly that you will wish it were longer... My mother sent me this book- I was a bit skeptical, but it really did live up to most of the praise. It is a quick read, (I couldn't put it down); that is engrossing, at times heartbreaking, and written in a lovable voice that woos the reader ever deeper into the McCourts' lives. It is what a memoir should be: a fascinating story- humorous and tragic; erring neither on the side of self-indulgence, nor the side of alienationing analysis. Yes, for once you should listen to the hype and borrow this one!"
5,I can't remember when a book so touched my soul.,From the moment I opened this book I was mesmerized by it's honesty and beauty. I found myself crying AND laughing. What a childhood! What courage! I hope Frank Mc Court has another 100 books in him.
3,Angela's Ashes,"Angela's Ashes gave great insight into the circumstances of the unfortunate poor class in Ireland. A realization of what our parents and grandparents went thru before imigrating to a place that held hope and promise for the future. A good read of critical times hard to deal with, of strengths and weaknesses of character within the suffering family of an alcoholic. It will be donated to my favorite library in Mexico."
2,Insulting to the Irish,"McCourt's memoir perpetuates every existing stereotype about the Irish, and caters to a few new ones. He seems to indict an entire country for his family's most particular kind of poverty, which is misleading and unfair. James Joyce's works, with their less-than-flattering depictions of Dublin life, seem almost nationalistic in comparison. No non-Irish person should read this book believing that it represents the true state of affairs in Limerick, much less Ireland as a whole."
1,Why was this cliche-ridden memoir written or published?,"I was raised by Irish Catholic parents, aunts, uncles, and nuns. Very few of the gripes or laments McCourt uses were new to me. His memoir is pure blarney. He may have had a rough childhood, but now he's trashing it for the filthy lucre. Can you imagine a book about a stingy Jew, a lazy African-American, or a stupid-but-libidinous Italian? Yet this slumming through Irish life has been a best-seller for two years. And it's not even the truth. McCourt should donate the proceeds to charity."
1,Have another beer Frank,"I got through halfway the book and gave up. Where is the the NY Times number 1 bestseller? It was boring and the chapters were redundant. Dad loses his job. Dad comes home blammo. Dad makes us sing. Another sibling croaks. Come on did he have such a precise memory of his childhood? I don't even know what I did an hour ago. The only thing good about this book is Pop's taste in his brewskies. But then again, you probably can't get anything other than Guinness in Ireland. And Frank, you ever hear of ""QUOTATION MARKS!?!?"""
1,Here goes my top 500 rating...,"... It is a chronicle of a tragic childhood with a good dose of the macabre - the scene with the dead baby made me shiver. Though, having known a number of people from Ireland, I am aware that the Celts do tend to have a rather morbid side to their religious beliefs, most are not in the situation where ... their parents were anything like this pair. Don't read this one for humour - it is appealing only for those who are relieved to find that they could have done worse than they did with their own dysfunctional families."
1,Angela's Ashes,"I hated this book. I had to read it for a class in school, and I did not enjoy it at all. If I would have the choice again I would say NO!"
